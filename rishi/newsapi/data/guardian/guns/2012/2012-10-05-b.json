  "<p>Syria has agreed to keep its forces six miles (10km) from the Turkish border in the wake of this week's deadly shelling incident, Turkish media have reported.</p> <p>Such a move would amount to a buffer zone, fulfilling a longstanding request by Syrian opposition groups that would allow rebels to operate freely and civilians to seek refuge.</p> <p>Syria has not confirmed the claim and Ankara has made no official announcement. However, several Turkish media outlets, citing well-placed sources, claimed that a deal had been struck.</p> <p>Opposition groups have implored Turkey and the international community to establish an area in which they can move without fear of jets and helicopters, claiming it would be a significant step in their 19-month battle to oust the regime of Bashar al-Assad.</p> <p>However, the demands have been rejected by Ankara, as well as the US and Nato, who have all repeatedly balked at suggestions that they intervene directly in the conflict. A buffer zone would not be effective unless it was enforced militarily, something that Turkey has so far been unwilling to do. However, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/03/turkey-syrian-mortar-bomb\" title=\"\">Syrian shelling of the Turkish border town of Akcacle</a> has spurred Ankara to recalibrate its military options to deal with the growing crisis across the southern border.</p> <p>On Thursday, the Turkish parliament approved a bill that would allow its military to launch cross-border raids at any point in the next year. Prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday that Turkey was not pushing for an escalation with its once close ally. \"We are not interested in war,\" he said. \"But we're not far from it either.\"</p> <p>Syria said it was waiting for the results of an investigation before publicly assigning blame for the shelling, which killed five Turkish civilians and wounded nine more. But it has privately conceded it was at fault and did not respond to a barrage of retaliatory Turkish shellfire, which is thought to have killed several Syrian soldiers.</p> <p>Turkish troops fired at Syria again yesterday, responding to another mortar shell that struck Turkish territory, the country's state-run news agency said.</p> <p>The shelling came hours after Erdogan called on Syria not to test Turkey's patience. The Anadolu Agency quoted Governor Celalettin Lekesiz as saying a mortar shell hit 50m inside the border in a rural area near the village of Asagipulluyaz in Hatay province. No one was hurt by the mortar, but Turkish troops based in the area immediately responded with fire, he said.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2012/oct/05/syrian-shelling-turkey-unsc-condemns-live\" title=\"\">Syrian air force continued to pound Aleppo</a> on Friday and reportedly launched its heaviest raids over the city of Homs in the past five months.</p> <p>Video footage uploaded to the internet on Thursday appeared to show a military helicopter being struck then crashing to the ground over Damascus, not far from where rebels claimed earlier on Friday to have seized control of a missile base.</p>",
  "<p>It should be easy, I think as I wait at Heathrow airport one early morning, to spot a ballerina amid the hunched, harassed people entering the arrivals hall. And so it proves. Tamara Rojo is waiting, standing by a wall with a cap pulled low over her face, but the posture gives her away: straight-backed and self-contained as people rush past trailing luggage and children.</p> <p>Rojo has just returned from Barcelona, where she was picking up another award to add to her collection, and I'm to interview her in the taxi on her way to the headquarters of <a href=\"http://www.ballet.org.uk/\" title=\"\">English National Ballet</a> in Kensington, where she is its new artistic director. It's the only time she has in a day that starts with ballet classes at 10am, followed by hours of rehearsal, then administrative work. The new season opens in less than two weeks and people will be waiting to see if this first-time artistic director has what it takes to lead Britain's second-biggest ballet company in challenging times, as funding cuts begin to bite. The&#xa0;ENB is a touring company that <a href=\"http://www.theartsdesk.com/dance/theartsdesk-debate-dances-question-time?page=0,3\" title=\"\">loses \u00a3100,000 a week on the road</a>, and has been criticised for preferring a narrower, commercial repertoire over creativity (and has already seen the departure of two artistic directors within 10 years).</p> <p>Rojo's new job won't have come as a surprise to anyone who follows dance \u2013 she has long talked of her wish to go into direction, and was tipped to be the next director of the Royal Ballet when Monica Mason retired last year, although <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/jun/14/kevin-ohare-royal-ballet-director\" title=\"\">it went to Kevin O'Hare</a>. Less than a year later, Rojo \u2013 the Royal Ballet's Spanish prima ballerina \u2013 got the job at ENB instead.</p> <p>\"I was thinking the other day that all of my career dancing has really just been a preparation for this,\" she says. \"I have been very fortunate to have danced and worked with amazing people, but now it's a moment to make it bigger than me. Your actions can have an effect beyond yourself, and more importantly into the art form itself, and hopefully into society too. I like the fact that you can change the world a little, bring it to more people. We're doing dance for Parkinson's [they run classes for people with the disease] and outreach work for children.\"</p> <p>The Sleeping Beauty, which opens ENB's season in Milton Keynes, and the Nutcracker are there to pay the bills, but she has made decisions to stage other more interesting choices too, such as the company's premiere of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QSK0R9o87E\" title=\"\">Petite Mort</a>, Jiri Kylian's contemporary choreography featuring fencing foils, in the spring, and&#xa0;a selection of pieces that make up A Tribute to Rudolf Nureyev next summer.</p> <p>She is hoping to work more with choreographers, and I doubt it will be long before she puts her considerable networking skills to use. \"I think that's something that I missed in my career \u2013 there weren't many opportunities to work with creators,\" she says. \"I felt sometimes it was a little bit frustrating to replicate something that was already created. To a certain extent, Swan Lake and Sleeping Beauty and other classics are old enough that you are freer, that you can really interpret them a bit like Shakespeare \u2013 however you want.</p> <p>\"The problem with choreographies that were done 10 or 20 years ago is that the people who created them are still around, and quite attached to them, so&#xa0;it's more difficult to put your own stamp on what you think this ballet should look like. I want to give more opportunities to dancers at the company to work directly with creators and bring out whatever they have.\"</p> <p>These jobs come up rarely, so she had to grab it, but Rojo still insists the timing was right, though many would disagree. At 38, she is at the peak of her powers as a dancer \u2013 \"this is the best time,\" she admits. \"I have reached the technical climax, but most importantly the emotional maturity. You really know what you are doing. It's quite a wonderful feeling.\" And yet she is walking away.</p> <p>She will still be performing with the ENB \u2013 and will go back to the Royal Ballet next year for her farewell performances \u2013 but being at a smaller company means missing out on roles there isn't the money to do. \"But life is full of choices,\" she says. \"You can't hold on to something, you have to let go so that new things can arrive. This was a new adventure. I had been at Covent Garden for 12 years, I had done many fantastic roles. I was at the peak, and the only way is down.\"</p> <p>She laughs. \"It's better to jump off while you're at the peak and jump to the&#xa0;next challenge.\"</p> <p>It doesn't feel like a sacrifice, she insists. \"It was going to happen one day, and the nice thing is I chose when, rather than it walking away from me, which could have happened at any time.\"</p> <p>For an audience, Rojo is dazzling \u2013 she has been praised for her acting as&#xa0;well as her technical brilliance as a dancer, and emotional depth \u2013 but she says she was wary of becoming a little bored. \"Not with the art form, but bored with myself \u2013 bored with being by myself in a studio for hours on end, analysing things that I&#xa0;had already analysed many times before. There was a point where I felt I was imitating myself, pretending I was interested, but had so many other things in my mind.\" Because she had reached the highest level and there was nowhere else to go? She nods. \"I had reached my own limit, reached what I could do in most of those roles. I had thought about [how to perform the role], come to a conclusion, and in my opinion, it was the best possible conclusion, so I wasn't going to go through the exercise again. So things that before would have taken four weeks to prepare were now taking two weeks, or even in 10 days if I was really fit. The good thing about coming to English National Ballet is it gives me a&#xa0;new range of repertoire, so I have to start again at that point of investigation, which I really enjoy.\"</p> <p>She says she still loves performing, \"but really truly good performances are few and far between \u2013 I can maybe count 10 in my whole career.\" Most of the time, she says with a laugh: \"I come out slightly disappointed with myself.\" I ask her what makes a great performance, and she thinks for a moment.</p> <p>\"It's an alchemy, something beyond your control. It's almost like you come out of yourself, you become something bigger than yourself. You gel with the public, with your partner, with the music. Some of those great shows haven't been technically spotless, but something else did take over.\"</p> <p>The first time she remembers feeling that was when she was 18, performing Giselle in Spain. \"At some point things just clicked, and I was Giselle.\" And in that constant pursuit of that one magical night, perhaps only the 11th time in a career spanning more than 20 years, \"you keep working. That's the hook, that's what you're always practising for. That magic can only happen when you are relaxed and you can only be relaxed when you feel like you are in control. It's&#xa0;delusional because you are never in control, but you think you are because you have done weeks of rehearsals and practice and know, 'Yes, I can do this.' That is when you let go of yourself.\"</p> <p>Rojo grew up in Madrid. Her parents \u2013 her father was an industrial engineer, her mother a finance director \u2013 were anti-Franco activists who were puzzled by their young daughter's passion for ballet, ignited when she was five. Rojo's drive and work ethic (she said recently she was \"not the best ballerina, but I was the most bloody-minded\") is much remarked on \u2013 was she like that as a child? \"Only in ballet. I was rather lazy in everything else. I wouldn't walk! My parents told me I was constantly asking to be carried. I hated physical activity of any kind.\" She laughs. \"I hated school. I&#xa0;think if I hadn't found ballet I would have been rather a lazy person.\"</p> <p>What did she like about it? \"It made me feel free. I didn't like talking very much. I think dancing felt like the one place I could be truly free.\" It was a surprise when her mother took her to see a performance of Swan Lake \u2013 Rojo didn't know you could be a professional ballerina, and the realisation that ballet was \"public\" frightened her. \"I didn't like it at all. I thought it was a travesty.</p> <p>\"For me, ballet was a personal experience, something I felt when I was in the studio, and the thought that people would be watching me felt intrusive. I thought: 'Maybe this isn't what I want to&#xa0;be, I'm not confident being watched while I have this personal experience.'\"</p> <p>But she came to terms with performing and, as a teenager, Rojo was doing six hours of ballet a day alongside school. At 20, she won the prestigious Paris International Dance competition, \"and I&#xa0;realised that maybe I was OK and I&#xa0;could make it.\" One of the judges, Galina Samsova, offered Rojo a place at Scottish Ballet, where she arrived with little English. Her abilities were soon recognised by other companies \u2013 she joined ENB, and then the Royal Ballet in 2000, where she stayed for 12 years as a principal dancer, becoming a star.</p> <p>We arrive at the English National Ballet building and go upstairs to her office. \"It is strange to be back, after all this time,\" she says. I stay and talk in the dressing room attached to her office while she puts makeup on for the photographs. A huge pile of satin pointe shoes weighs down a shelf.</p> <p>It's a cliche that ballerinas have to endure great suffering for their art, but there are sacrifices. Rojo, who has had injuries, says she is in pain every day. \"Always. Somewhere. You get used to it. It's like a noise, a hum somewhere, and because it's constant you ignore it, but you learn when it changes sound and you need help.\" She has been outspoken before about the pressures on ballerinas to conform to a very thin aesthetic, pressures she has experienced, \"sometimes very explicitly: 'You're too fat.' At&#xa0;the time it was painful, and I believed the words because they were [from] people who, in theory, wanted the best for me. And sometimes I did starve myself and that's when I realised actually I'm losing my technique, my strength. I don't want to be a 'fake' dancer who is pretending to jump but is&#xa0;not using the muscles because she has&#xa0;no energy. I stopped enjoying dancing, so what was the point.\"</p> <p>Rojo has hinted in the past at how the workload and its emotional intensity can be tough on relationships, although she says today, \"I don't think it's any harder than for anyone else. I think having relationships is just difficult, for many reasons.\" She laughs. \"I'm lucky, I'm happy, but it was a question of finding someone [her partner is a lighting designer] who shares my interests.\"</p> <p>Rojo has a big role ahead of her, and although she brings the perfect package of drive, vision and box-office appeal, it won't be easy. The financial situation \u2013 the ENB <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture-cuts-blog/2011/mar/30/arts-council-funding-decision-day-cuts\" title=\"\">has had its Arts Council funding cut by 15%</a> \u2013 \"will affect the choices we have to make,\" she says. \"Governments and people who make these decisions have to realise that yes, you might still have ballet companies, but it's going to be rare that they can take big creative risks that mean the art form continues to be alive and healthy. But hopefully we can do a bit of both. The question is, how long can we sustain that?\" I'm about to leave her to sit on the floor and&#xa0;tape up her toes ready for class.</p> <p>\"Art gives hope,\" she says with a smile, \"and in moments like this, it's more necessary than ever.\"</p> <p><em>The Sleeping Beauty is at Milton Keynes Theatre 17-20 October, then touring.

  "<p>At the time of writing, the number of civil servants suspended over the awarding of the West Coast mainline rail franchise to First Group is three. They had misapplied the awarding criteria, and their suspension seems unfair on the face of it, like being expelled from school for failing a maths test. One newspaper damned the incompetence of the civil&#xa0;service, then rather undercut its own indignation by admitting that the&#xa0;calculations behind the awarding&#xa0;of&#xa0;rail&#xa0;franchises was \"horrendously&#xa0;complicated\".</p> <p>The companies bidding to run our rail franchises must make predictions of future revenue. The maths becomes very complicated when it spirals into these hypothecations, but the tendency is to make an optimistic prediction, so as&#xa0;to justify making an attractively high offer to the perennially cash-strapped Department of Transport. Two franchisees on the East Coast mainline went bust having overbid, and several other franchisees are under what are touchingly called \"special measures\", having got into trouble through over-bidding. So our railway is becoming like a carehome for disappointed optimists, who must gradually be brought down to earth by doses of reality.</p> <p>By mounting a legal challenge to the First Group's bid for the West Coast franchise, which he considered insupportably risky, Sir Richard Branson may have begun the unravelling of the whole franchising process. It is to be put under review, and may be deemed fundamentally flawed. So a principal beneficiary of our system of privatised railways (one of Branson's colleagues let slip that the West Coast franchise was \"a licence to print money\") may have brought about its undoing.</p> <p>Branson has operated the West Coast for 15 years, and there seems little doubt that he has operated it well. At least, there was little doubt on the 16.57 Virgin train from Euston to Glasgow on Thursday. I asked a man in the lavatory queue whether, in view of the franchising chaos, he would favour a return to nationalised railway. \"Ah, but then we wouldn't have Mr Branson, would we?\" A couple sitting in standard class used the service regularly. \"It's generally excellent. There was a bit of a problem coming into Euston this morning, but that was trespassers on the line, and you can't blame Richard Branson for that.\" Did they think he should be allowed to keep the franchise? \"Definitely.\" A hundred and forty thousand users of the line have signed a petition to that effect.</p> <p>Branson did not personally upgrade the West Coast mainline. That was down to Network Rail, the body that operates the infrastructure of the privatised railway. But people generally approve of&#xa0;the Pendolino trains he brought in to run on the line. At Tamworth, where I&#xa0;disembarked from the Glasgow train, I met a rail enthusiast whose approximate age was indicated by his name: Harold. After we'd been momentarily deafened by a Virgin train definitely non-stopping at Tamworth (it roared through at 125 miles an hour) Harold nodded approvingly, and said: \"Some of the lads at Doncaster had been hoping Branson would get the East Coast franchise \u2013 so they could see those every day.\"</p> <p>Personally, I do not like the trains. They are, like Branson himself, flash. The livery is yellow and red, the colour of a squeezed spot. The carriages feel cramped, the warm red of the seats undermined by the blue of the hand holds and carpet. Many of the seats are not aligned to windows, whereas almost all the luggage racks are. The electronic doors are liable to open when their occupants least expect it, presenting traumatising scenes to those passing by, and the passenger alarm is located where the flush button ought to be, so one hears the repeated triple quack of that alarm on almost every journey. The buffet on the trains is crassly called a \"shop\", and the people who work there are required to wear red shirts reading \"Team VT\", meaning \"Virgin Trains\", because there's a direct equivalence between serving Grab Bags of crisps and running 100 metres in the Olympics.</p> <p>But then the West Coast mainline has never been a thing of beauty. Contrary to its name, it is deeply embedded in the industrial Midlands and North, and it is rooted at the hideous Euston. As for Branson, the railways have always attracted flamboyant plutocrats. For a relatively brief period, however (1948-1997), we had a People's Railway. I refer to British Railways, latterly British Rail, and as the son of one of its employees, I&#xa0;feel a surge of nostalgia whenever I see the BR double arrow logo that still points the way to the station in most towns. It seems increasing numbers of people are similarly susceptible, and Labour's transport spokesperson, Maria Eagle, welcomed a thinktank report this summer that advocated a return to public ownership.</p> <p>It is now regularly pointed out that the railway operating subsidy is about four times higher under a privatised system than it was in the days of BR. The privatised system is expensive partly because of \"fracturing\". We rail users encounter this every day, and it engenders a persistent migraine. For example, I knew I would have to change at Rugby on my way back to London from Tamworth. But the train proposing to take me there was not a Virgin train. I&#xa0;had bought my ticket from a Virgin-themed booking office at Euston; I had come to Tamworth by Virgin, but here was an all together more modest London Midland train at the platform. Should I board it? Perhaps my ticket did not entitle me to, and I would have to pay a penalty fare? Eventually a guard turned up and reassured me. \"You're fine; your ticket says 'Any permitted', you see.\" He was a nice chap, so I didn't bother saying that \"Any permitted\" is meaningless. He explained that Virgin was not the sole operator on the West Coast mainline, only the principal operator, hence this different train. I&#xa0;asked whether passengers were often confused by this. \"Constantly.\"</p> <p>This fracturing denies economies of scale, and creates a need to paper over the cracks between the regional franchises by means of complicated contracts \u2013 or it might be simpler to think of that paper as taking the form of cheques paid to accountants and lawyers. Then there is the money lost to the system by the profit-taking of the train-operating companies. This is their reward for their supposed dynamism and entrepreneurial flair. But as Richard Hebditch of the Campaign for Better Transport points out, \"Is entrepreneurial flair the main requirement in running a railway? I'd have thought that Prussian military efficiency was more the thing.\"</p> <p>Even though we as a country invented railways, we have always had a neurotic attitude to their operation. We have never settled down to running them as they are run in most of Europe: as a service that is unlikely to be profitable, but that is nonetheless socially essential. It has been suggested that this was because we never had a standing army, so never accustomed ourselves to systematic, state-wide organisation. The&#xa0;tension was inherent in BR.</p> <p>If you asked my father where he worked, he'd proudly say, \"Head office!\" by which he meant North Eastern Region HQ of British Rail in York. (It's true that on his desk was a plaque reading \"I am surrounded by idiots\", but that was a joke). He and his colleagues were railwaymen, securely and proudly inhabiting a railway world. We went on holiday with the British Rail Touring Club. As a boy I played snooker at the Railway Institute; I was assistant stage manager for the Railway Players. When I&#xa0;boarded a train with my dad, he was never required to show Privilege tickets because he knew all the collectors by name. Even now, in retirement, the first thing he does when I call him proposing a visit is reach for a timetable.</p> <p>He thought of himself as providing a service to the country much as a doctor working for the NHS does (or did). But that world gradually became less secure. My father would complain that BR was denied the ability to plan financially. \"Every year we have to go cap-in-hand to the treasury,\" and there was a particular bitterness to those words \"cap-in-hand\", as though it was a personal humiliation. He seemed to be swimming against the tide. Perhaps railways were not essential after all; perhaps the car was the answer. In the 1970s, my dad had a rival: a travelling salesman who lived at the end of our road. \"I'd abolish the bloody railways,\" he would rudely proclaim. \"Too expensive, too inefficient, too unionised. I'd replace them with a network of motorways.\" My dad once lured him into a trap: \"And would those roads be dead straight with a constant succession of comfortable coaches running along them?\" \"They would,\" said the man. \"Then that's called a railway!\" my dad shot back.</p> <p>Nobody thinks like that man now. The penny has dropped about the railways. They are essential in a society where the&#xa0;demand for travel is increasing inexorably. (Even in a recession, rail use is at its highest since the 1920s, and rising). And they do have \"non-user benefits\", being environmentally friendly, and capable of social regeneration. It is the social regeneration offered by high-speed rail that David Cameron has been commending to us. If the railways are a national good, then it might be asked why the farepayer is asked to contribute an increasingly large proportion of the costs of running them. Wouldn't it be more logical to penalise the people who don't use them? But let's not get into that. Instead, let's note that the utility of railway is being recognised by some of the highest levels of investment in living memory. This investment partly explains why the annual bill for running our railways is so&#xa0;high. It would be wrong to think of all&#xa0;the money as being funnelled into the pockets of the fat cats.</p> <p>In fact, the question of how the train-operating companies are franchised is marginal compared to the infrastructure operation of Network Rail, an organisation ambiguously defined, but whose vast levels of borrowing are backed by the government. It is, in effect, nationalised, and the government does make most of the decisions to do with the railways. Our railways might be thought of as a giant state-owned and managed tower block, with a privatised penthouse at the top, in which the train operators disport themselves. Should the state take over that penthouse and close down the rather embarrassing party going on within? It would simply be a matter of letting the franchises fall back into the lap of the state as they come up for renewal.</p> <p>I was disappointed to discover that most of the experts don't favour a return to BR, as such. It would be too centralised in London. Professor Paul Salveson, railway consultant, thinks a nationalised intercity network of main lines might work. But it would be complimented by a reinforcement of local control over franchises, as already happens in Scotland and Wales \u2013 and on Merseyside, where Merseyrail was franchised by the Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive, as opposed to the Department of Transport. He argues that \"local authorities should be free to decide what's best for them, and the franchisees would be subject to a degree of democratic accountability.\" Salveson also speaks excitedly of plans for a new transport executive to unite the main northern conurbations.</p> <p>This is very much the line taken by the Campaign for Better Transport, whose executive director, Stephen Joseph, also invokes the orbital London railway, the London Overground. This is a model railway in many respects. It is, elegantly branded, scenic (in a demotic way, going past many fascinating back gardens), and has stylish new trains. It&#xa0;is&#xa0;locally franchised (by Transport for&#xa0;London), and that franchise differs from the high-pressure ones handed out by the Department of Transport. The franchisee (a consortia of companies) did not have to guess future revenues, and does not bear all the financial risk of the operation. It is, in effect, paid a fixed fee for running a railway. That is demanding enough in itself, without requiring railway men and women to be accountants, lawyers, PRs and crystal ball gazers into the bargain.</p> <p><em>Andrew Martin is the author of The&#xa0;Baghdad Railway Club</em></p>",

  "<p><strong>My childhood was extreme.</strong> When I was growing up [in Maryland] in the 60s \u2013 my father a minister, my mother, part native-American but a Christian woman \u2013 going to church was mandatory. Four times a week, three times on a Sunday. The church was a very active, social place. Sort of like the pub for England. Was it a happy time? I don't know about that. My grandmother, my father's mother, had that missionary zeal. She'd always say: \"You give your body to the man you marry and you give your soul to God.\" I said to her at five: \"And what do I get for me?\" I ended up in the corner having the Bible read to me for an hour.</p> <p><strong>My father has a pragmatic mind.</strong> He marched with Dr King in the 60s, and he's very much for women's rights. And being exposed to so many gay people who work on my tours and shoots \u2013 he's evolved to seeing them as individuals, as people, and not as \"the gays\".</p> <p><strong>My mother's parents</strong> were the heart and soul of North Carolina. I'd spend four months a year with them, all summer. Papa, my mother's father, was a great storyteller. He had perfect pitch, would smoke his pipe on the porch and tell stories. That was very warm.</p> <p><strong>I have an intercontinental relationship</strong> with Mark [Hawley, Tori's British-born husband]. A key to keeping your husband is getting him to miss you. That keeps a marriage fresh. We live a life that is separately together. Our American home is by the Indian river, Florida. Mark has his UK place down in Cornwall. We've been married 14 years and it's one of the key reasons we're not at each other's throats, because you take yourself out of the equation. When I'm on the road, he's with the crew and I'm on the band bus. That was where I first began to see: after three nights of back-to-back shows and then you're together in a hotel room on a day off, it would be, \"Oh \u2026 hello!\" You begin to see there's a romance. But he likes his time alone.</p> <p><strong>I'm not very social</strong> when I'm off the promo trail, because I step into wife and mother mode. It's very reclusive. In Cornwall, sometimes I don't leave the compound for a month at a time. My husband will go on his motorbike and keep me locked away all to himself, which is sort of romantic.</p> <p><strong>I have a great relationship with my mother-in-law.</strong> We're both Leos, we understand each other. My daughter Tash [12] has an incredible relationship with her. That inspires me. It's because of her wisdom that I was able to agree to boarding school \u2013 Tash is in year 8 at Sylvia Young theatre school. My husband was all for it because he went to boarding school. It was very difficult for me to let her go \u2013 it's not of my culture. It was my mother-in-law who explained to me why it was a good idea. And she was right.</p> <p><strong>My brother died in 2004.</strong> He was in a car accident. He had three children; they're older and spread out. I'm very close with my sister, a doctor outside of Washington, and I'm very close to her kids. My niece Kelsey sang on my last album, my other niece Cody worked on my tours for a while as PA. They're Tash's cousins, but when they have children she'll be Aunt Tash.</p> <p><strong>Parenting is not for everybody.</strong> It changes your life. Especially when they're little. If you think a child is going to be your accessory \u2026 it's not like a micro pig. It's not about putting them in front of the television. You need to read to them at night. But once they start to have their own social circle, they are busy and don't text you back \u2013 ever. Then you get your life back.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Tori Amos's new album, </em><a href=\"http://toriamos.com/go/music/\" title=\"\"><em>Gold Dust</em></a><em>, is released by Deutsche Grammophon</em></p>",
  "<p><strong>My father is in his late 70s and lives near my sister, who is married with two sons, aged 12 and 10. Recently, my father told me that, while my sister was away, her husband persuaded him to lend him \u00a310,000. Both my father and I know, based on experience, that this money will not be repaid. My sister is unaware of this transaction, and my father is adamant that I should not mention it. </strong></p> <p><strong>What my father does not know is that my brother-in-law has been financially indebted to criminals, and received death threats. He informed the police as a means of protecting himself. He has also plundered his way through most of my sister's money while he has sought to fulfil his ambitions \u2013 and therefore not looked for paid employment. I also know that when drunk and jealous, he has been threatening and violent towards my sister, and she has feared for her safety.</strong></p> <p><strong>My sister has long confided in me about these difficulties in her marriage. I know she has forbidden her husband to ask our father for money. She indicated to me that this was her metaphorical \"red line\". I&#xa0;feel compromised by withholding my&#xa0;father's information from her, even though it would cause her huge distress. Should I tell her (as I feel I&#xa0;ought)? But I fear the consequence for her marriage (and possibly her safety), and for me, in terms of my relationship with my father. I fear he would be less inclined to confide in me in future. Or should I&#xa0;do nothing, as my father requests, and not interfere in my family's lives, even though I feel I am somehow failing my sister. <em>Anon,&#xa0;via email</em></strong></p> <p>Your letter concerned me greatly. We need to be very clear about what is happening here \u2013 your sister is in a domestically violent relationship. By&#xa0;telling her, you are not destroying her marriage; her husband has done that already.</p> <p>What I see here are people \u2013 you, your father, your sister \u2013 who know something is wrong, but do not dare to do anything about it out of fear. This is what abusive, controlling people do. They disempower. I think your father told you because he wants you to do something. I think your sister has told you she has a line she won't cross, thereby telling you the trigger she needs to act. I think your instincts are spot on. This cannot be allowed to continue (because it will continue \u2013 your brother-in-law won't change). To do nothing, to stay silent, is to collude with your brother-in-law and let him continue his bullying, abusive ways. This is a time for your family to unite, and you cannot do this while withholding information from each other.</p> <p>I contacted a domestic violence counsellor and the police about your letter (I did not disclose any of your personal details). The counsellor was very concerned about the level of abuse within your family. \"Your brother-in-law is emotionally blackmailing an already vulnerable older man. The likelihood is that he will continue to do this as your father is an easy target. I understand your concerns regarding your sister's wellbeing, but she can only make decisions about the safety and wellbeing of her family if she is in possession of all the facts. Your nephews are living in an abusive household and even if your sister does not recognise this, they are still being affected by continuing to live in this situation.\" She also pointed out that if this were a stranger extorting money from your father, you would not hesitate to contact the police.</p> <p>\"If you do decide to speak to your sister,\" the counsellor advises, \"it is very important you explain to your father the reasons why you have had to do this. This might be easier to achieve if both you and your sister talk to him. If your sister reacts as you suspect she will, this will be a time of increased risk. Therefore, I suggest you arm yourself with appropriate support numbers and contacts to ensure your sister and her children remain safe. Local <a href=\"http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/\" title=\"\">CAB</a> or police or <a href=\"http://www.womensaid.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Women's Aid</a> can offer support with this.\"</p> <p>The police said they would investigate if you reported this to them, both about the money and the domestic violence.</p> <p>Can I please urge you and your sister&#xa0;to contact <a href=\"http://womensaid.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Women's Aid</a> (0808 2000 247).</p> <h2>Your problems solved<br></h2> <p>Contact Annalisa Barbieri, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU or email\u2008annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

Which is perhaps why I'm rather jealous of King Krule, the 18-year-old who sounds like he chain-smokes car exhausts and sings like John Cooper Clarke's posh southern brother. Rock Bottom is cloaked in beyond-his-years angst, and sounds like a long-lost Ian Dury song from 1983; that is to say, it's really, really good.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLyF6PV7BF0\" title=\"\"><strong>Tomorrow's World</strong></a><strong> </strong><br><strong>So Long My Love (na\u00efve/Prototyp)</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Members of Air and New Young Pony Club unite for this chillingly whacked-out song that suggests they weren't The Ones Who Looked Bored At The Back at all, but rather epic sci-fi geeks on a mission to revitalise a stale electronic scene with songs of eerie brilliance. Repeated listens suggest Can, the Normal, Grace Jones and too much time spent attempting to french-kiss an HD flatscreen whenever a Dalek appears on it.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m08PRBWtV4I\" title=\"\"><strong>Lisa Marie Presley</strong></a><strong> </strong><br><strong>You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet (Universal)</strong></h2> <p>Or to give it its full title: You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet, Xenu! (You Can Keep The E-Meter, BTW.) Yes, this appears as if it could be Lisa Marie's farewell ode to Scientology, and lyrically it doesn't sit on the fence when it comes to talking about cult submission and mind control. Admittedly, this makes it sound about as much fun as sitting through a Kirstie Alley film with John Travolta hand-feeding you popcorn, but it slinks along in a rather lovely, Bobbie Gentry-style way, with its southern gothic charm suiting Presley's deadpan delivery right down to the ground.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6xGy_6hseI\" title=\"\"><strong>Daphni</strong></a><strong> </strong><br><strong>Paris (Jiaolong)</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>This krautrock stormer is the kind of song that marks that moment at the end of the night when your friend (the one who has sick in his hair and shoes on the wrong feet) mumbles incoherently about \"shots of Apple Sourz\". Which you know is drunk code for, \"If you don't do a shot with me, I'll go home, cry and try to sandwich toaster myself to death.\" And right there, in the grip of Paris's polyrhythmic face-hug ... oh, I've missed the night bus home.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5U6CaNlyEQ\" title=\"\"><strong>Leona Lewis</strong></a><strong> </strong><br><strong>Trouble (Syco)</strong></h2> <p>\"I'm a whole lot of trouble,\" sings Leona, rather unbelievably, on this atmospheric track which is a little bit dubstep but not enough to scare the mums. In the world of fantasy celebrity relationships I have in my head, I think she's probably just below Mel from Mel and Sue in the low-maintenance/wouldn't judge me for owning the special edition of the Bowfinger DVD/would suggest buying the navy blue shirt over the neon pink one in Debenhams because \"it's a bit too jazzy, isn't it?\" stakes. Not Trouble At All, then, it should probably be retitled. Really Easy, Actually, Though I Might Make A Face About A Side Table In Ikea If Pushed.</p>",
  "<h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hfxWjUcbzs\" title=\"\"><strong>Ill Manors</strong></a></h2> <p>Preliminary reports on this weren't good: the production was troubled by financial woes and other more unusual problems, such as run-ins with local toughs while shooting on location. It offered no reassurance either in the fact that it was being directed by a first-timer better known for his music (Ben Drew, AKA Plan B). Even the trailer conspired against it, looking like the sort of mockney nonsense that Danny Dyer inhabits. </p> <p>But Ill Manors is a lot better than that. With constantly stylish camerawork and a rather ruthless way about it, Ill Manors may feature all the requisite drug dealers, gangsters and prostitutes, but it wins out by treating the whole thing as tragedy rather than as a lark. Inspired by films such as Nicolas Winding Refn's Pusher, Drew shows his characters locked into a lifestyle that leads nowhere. We follow a succession of people with little hope, and when a new character crosses their paths the film winds back to show how they got there. It's a stuttering circle of depravity, showing how low they have to go before some basic human decency kicks in. Some have never lost this quality, some never find it. Drew may go a bit broad sometimes, with his on-the-nose rapping exposition and grainy shots of the protagonists as kids, but it's all still very effective: it doesn't so much press the right buttons as punch the hell out of them.</p> <p><em>DVD &amp; Blu-ray, Revolver</em></p> <h2><strong>Prometheus</strong></h2> <p>Ridley Scott returns with an amazing-looking movie.

  "<p>People are always asking where my ideas come from. Well, the answer's simple. They don't come from some weird ideas organ inside my head. They come from life. I just watch people around me \u2013 my family, strangers \u2026 you \u2013 and put what I see and hear into my cartoons. So if you catch someone staring at you on a train or listening to your conversation on the bus, it might be me. Better shut up or beat me to death before I can get to a sheet of paper and jot down your secrets for all to see.</p> <p>It's rare that I use something exactly as it happens. It usually needs tweaking but, luckily, I possess an up-to-date Artistic Licence. Loomus (whose name I stole from the builder who repaired my studio roof) and his mum and dad are an amalgamation of many parents I&#xa0;know, including myself.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/cartoon/2009/nov/13/family1\" title=\"\">The Song of School Mornings</a> (see above) is still the morning routine in our house and will be for some time yet, though the years when my children worried about death and inspired that cartoon seem to have passed. Perhaps I should draw a cartoon called Why We Stop Worrying About Death?</p> <p>The Husband Flap is a sideways leap of logic (thank you, Pete), which just feels right. Even if husbands don't behave like that in reality, it's a made-up idea that somehow contains the truth.</p> <p>On the other hand, Some of the Many Small Joys of Living in a Family was taken from personal experience. Before living in a family, if I had a cough and a temperature I would lie awake in bed in my single person's flat, wondering exactly what the character in the final frame is saying (\"If I die during the night, how long will it be before someone finds my body?\"). And although I'd now add \"motorbikes in the garden\" and \"dog vomit\" to the joyful experiences, the rest is still pretty accurate.</p> <p>Of course, no amount of persuasion will make me admit to the source of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/cartoon/2010/feb/13/family\" title=\"\">The Miracle Cure</a>, though all of you probably know \u2013 or are \u2013 a teenager who fits the description. Marmie is invented, but partly inspired by my choice to change my image and step into another gender.</p> <p>So what turned me into a cartoonist? I've no idea. Perhaps it was poring over the cartoons in my grandfather's copies of Punch as a child, or reading <a href=\"http://www.beano.com/\" title=\"\">the Beano</a> every week. Maybe it was loving the drawings of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/03/ronald-searle-st-trinians-creator-dies\" title=\"\">Ronald Searle</a> and Charles Addams, which I found on my parents' bookshelves. Or perhaps it was growing up, the eldest of four children, in a wonderful, draughty old vicarage close to the Scottish Borders.</p> <p>My mother, in her quiet, unconditionally loving way, was full of exotic stories and experiences. She came from Canada, a distant land of snow and french toast, far away across the sea, where she skated and skied in the day and danced to big bands by night.</p> <p>Love for my dad brought her to Britain on a convoy towards the end of the second world war. An amazing floating city of ships stretching to the horizon, vulnerable to storms and U-boats, which eventually arrived at dawn in a burning city. She travelled alone to live with my father's family in a tiny village on the coast of north Northumberland while he was still away flying planes in Burma.</p> <p>Together, after the war, they bred boxer dogs, performed with the village amateur dramatic society and laughed at <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0072vdz\" title=\"\">The Goon Show</a> on the wireless. Eleven years later, I arrived, and we moved to the dilapidated old vicarage where, when one bedroom ceiling started leaking, the previous occupant had merely moved to another room. Various hallways and brown-painted doors led to unused rooms or rooms piled high with furniture. Outside, abandoned scenery from an amateur dramatic production was stacked and stored in a rarely visited outbuilding.</p> <p>In winter there were only three warm places in the house: the kitchen, the sitting room, and tucked up in bed where, cuddling Eccles, my hot water bottle, I'd daydream that aliens were landing on the lawn outside my bedroom window, or that I'd find a doorway to another world if I crawled deep beneath the bedclothes. Life was full of&#xa0;magic and wonder and infinite possibility. I could be an astronaut, a writer, an explorer ... Nothing seemed impossible. I even sort of assumed, despite knowing full well I was a boy, that one day I'd grow up to be a girl.</p> <p>Then I went off to boarding school, became a teenager, passed into my 20s, and the range of possibilities faded. It took me years to rediscover that life can be as surreal and strange, or as dull and dreary, as you care to make it.</p> <p>Nowadays I watch my own children and wonder if I'm providing enough strangeness and wonder to protect them from being crushed and swamped by everyday life. Are their childhoods idiosyncratic enough to prepare them for their future as artists, scientists, musicians, politicians or \u2013 goodness, it feels naughty and a little perverse even to write it, but here goes \u2013 bankers? I certainly can't afford to bring them up in a vast, dilapidated house or send them to boarding school. And anyway, what exactly is it that provides the rich loam that allows kids to grow up into well-adjusted, unusual and happy, fulfilled adults? Security? Love? It's a mystery, so I guess my family will have to continue along as we're doing now, in our little house cluttered with cats, clothes, colours, dogs, fish, music, books, shoes, pictures, TVs, computer games, an abundance of parents (four), siblings from assorted relationships (five), me in my skirts, makeup and jewellery, their mum in her white headphones listening to story tapes as&#xa0;she gardens, their oldest brother playing jazz on the piano or hip-hop in&#xa0;the chaos of his bedroom ...</p> <p>I hope there's enough craziness there to keep them sane.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Steven Appleby's Guide to Life, the collected Loomus cartoons, is published by Guardian Books on 11 October for \u00a314.99.

The 26-year-old Australian frontman (well, <em>everything</em> man) of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/tame-impala\" title=\"\">Tame Impala</a> is about to release one of the autumn's most talked-about albums in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2012/oct/02/tame-impala-lonerism-album-stream?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Lonerism</a>, the follow-up to 2010's slow-burning but addictive <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/aug/20/tame-impala-innerspeaker-cd-review\" title=\"\">Innerspeaker</a>.</p> <p>If that debut was a classic wedge of psychedelic stoner pop, its fuzzy logic burbling through the speakers, then Lonerism seems to be Parker's own Electric Kool Aid Acid Test: a journey of songs in delirious, kaleidoscopic Technicolor, with trippy paranoia seeping through Why Won't They Talk To Me?, Apocalypse Dreams and the mantra-like insistence of album opener Be Above It.</p> <p>\"I'm always surprised whenever someone tells me Tame Impala reminds them of getting blazed. I never think my own music is druggy at all,\" says Parker, considering his sound's synthesthetic appeal. \"Sometimes it helps. I don't wanna say it's a requirement. For me, it's like doing high jump at an athletics carnival: if you can do it without drugs, that's good. If you can get higher <em>with</em> drugs, that's great. But if you need drugs to get to that bar in the first place, that's not right. It should be in you regardless. People's imaginations and dreams are more fucked-up than drugs; it's just the sound of music in my head.\"</p> <p>If that's the case, the inside of Parker's mind is a brilliantly warped pop boggle. Listen to Tame Impala and watch them play live, and you could be forgiven for thinking this was your holy grail of a rock'n'roll band, built on a foundation of epic living and excess, bonded through the supersize psych-rock jams they've made their calling card. The truth, however, is that this five-piece are just a front, the touring cover for a solo project orchestrated from Parker's bedroom. A self-proclaimed loner, he composes and records every layer of sound on his songs before calling on his mates \u2013 who are all in other Perth bands \u2013 to play out their respective parts. They're there to beef up the live shows, and to stop Parker from getting locked in his own head.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b0jqPvpn3sY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b0jqPvpn3sY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b0jqPvpn3sY\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to view</a></p> <p>\"[Lonerism] almost drove me insane. In fact, it pretty much did; it was two agonising years, one in Perth, one in Paris,\" says Parker, explaining that songs come relatively quickly to him: \"Without wanting to sound like I'm some fucking spiritual being, they come in flashes.\" But that's then followed by an extended process in which he tinkers with them relentlessly, stuck in a vicious cycle of insecurity. \"I'd have the idea and do most of the song in about a night and spend the next two years listening to it over and over,\" he says. \"I'd cycle through different drum sounds, different guitar sounds, do a lot of pointless stuff. Not a lot changes, that's the fucking crucifying thing.\"</p> <p>Dressed in faded jeans and an adorably dweeby cardigan, his surfer hair in a centre-parting, Parker looks like the bastard child of Kurt Cobain and Joan Baez. Previous interviews have suggested he's incredibly shy or obtuse. In person, he's neither; he's funny, introspective and honest.</p> <p>Reflecting on his hyper-sensitivity and self-doubt (surely, the twin engines powering all tortured artists), Parker is thoughtful, but mostly relieved to have reached the finishing line with a new set of songs. \"If you don't have anyone to talk to at the time, it grows into a massive beast ricocheting inside your head,\" he says. \"You have no way of stopping it when it's just <em>you</em> making the music. A bad thought can spiral and you can get so depressed you just think you're worthless. There were times recording this album that I thought, 'This the worst fucking thing I've ever heard in my life.'\" There's an awkward pause, which I almost jump to fill with hurried reassurance, before he cracks a grin: \"Conversely, sometimes I listen to it and think it's the best thing ever.\"</p> <h2>'There were times recording this album that I thought: 'This the worst fucking thing I've ever heard in my life'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397348828\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349277335043/Tame-Impala-008.jpg\" alt=\"Tame Impala\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Parker onstage in Lorne, Australia, 2010.

She didn't dig that so she left him,\" he says. Parker moved with his mum, while his older brother stayed with his dad: \"She was creative, he was an accountant. But a closet musician at heart.\"</p> <p>There were always instruments at his dad's house and tons of records \u2013 Supertramp, the Shadows, the Beatles, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/beach-boys\" title=\"\">the Beach Boys</a> \u2013 all of which shaped his early tastes. Eventually, he moved in with his dad, brother and step-brother: \"Mum was starting to freak me out changing through boyfriends quite a lot and I was slightly intimidated. I wanted to become part of the dad scene, living near the beach and stuff.\"</p> <p>So he learned the drums and guitar and accelerated through a whole rebellion of skunk, booze, shoplifting and being sent home in a police car, all by the time he was 13. He went to an expensive, private Catholic high school where he met Dom (his closest friend and guitarist in Tame Impala), though Parker's dad (\"a square\") made sure he enrolled in an engineering degree at university. Somewhere in between, after more than a decade of divorce, his parents got back together: \"Yeah, for two months. It was weird. Then exciting. Then tragic.\"</p> <p>Parker switched courses to astronomy, but skipped pretty much every lecture. He spent a year working for a law firm, obliviously serving papers to people across the city (\"I loved it cos I just got to walk around all day in total solitude all week\"), and then later, in an off-licence, so he could concentrate better on making music. \"I was always putting songs on the internet,\" he says, supposing they're still there, \"but I was never into pushing them on anyone.\" Eventually, he found himself in the middle of Perth's tiny collective of \"musos\" where \"the idea of [making music] to please someone else is really kind of taboo\".</p> <p>It's a tight-knit scene; most of Tame Impala met through the apparently notorious Troy Terrace, Parker's home in the city for four years, and the base for their first collaboration as <a href=\"http://tameimpala.tumblr.com/bootlegs\" title=\"\">Mink Mussel Creek</a>. Troy Terrace was, he says, \"a total pit, with broken instruments and recording equipment in every single room\". Bands such as Space Lime Peacock and <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/rabbitisland\" title=\"\">Rabbit Island</a> also formed via Perth's unofficial indie HQ as, in the grand tradition of rock mythology, \"the door was always open, there was always something obscure playing and a spliff being passed around.\" Downstairs, they got wasted and jammed; upstairs Parker worked on his solo stuff on an eight-track, in the same way he'd been doing it since he was 13.</p> <h2>'The guys I play live with have always had their own bands and been busy with that. Each band we're involved with is one part of the puzzle'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397348829\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349277481527/Tame-Impala-008.jpg\" alt=\"Tame Impala\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tame Impala onstage in New York City, 2010.

The pair met in Paris a couple of years ago and though their relationship is the only thing he is reluctant to talk about, Parker has produced her debut album (released in the UK on Weird World on 5 Nov), with the rest of the band helping record the tracks she had written.</p> <p>Whichever way Parker cuts it (and his default setting is to modestly downplay), the next few months mark a hugely exciting moment in Tame Impala's transition from bedroom to sell-out tour success. He jokes about having written \"seven or eight\" songs for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/kylieminogue\" title=\"\">Kylie</a> if she'll have them. If Minogue's management have any sense, they'll be knocking his door down. Noels Gallagher and Fielding have raved about the live shows, and Parker is pleased that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/the-flaming-lips\" title=\"\">the Flaming Lips</a> and Mark Ronson like the band but insists, \"I'm not really into that.\" Instead, Parker's pleasures are simple: riding around Paris on a bike, sitting on a beach in Perth, or watching Futurama. \"This is where you work out how uncultured and uneducated I really am!\" he laughs. Given his dreamer-like disposition and knack for self-criticism, I'm curious about how much he's enjoying doing what he's always wanted. Is being Tame Impala everything he expected? \"Sure! I'm in Paris, drinking a beer, talking about myself for hours. Sure.

  "<p>Chelsea have offered their full support to Ashley Cole and Dave Barnard in spite of the fierce criticism that they took in the full written judgment from the Football Association's regulatory commission into the John Terry affair.</p> <p>The European champions found themselves under siege on Friday as their England left-back and club secretary were condemned in the strongest terms for giving allegedly unreliable evidence in support of Terry, the captain, who was found guilty last week by the commission of racially abusing the Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand.</p> <p>The commission suggested that Cole's evidence had \"evolved\" over time to suit Terry's defence; specifically, in relation to his hearing, Ferdinand used the word \"black\" in the flashpoint between the players at Loftus Road in October of last year. The use or otherwise of the word had serious implications.</p> <p>The commission was scathing about Cole, having reached the conclusion that he \"did not hear and could not have believed, understood or misunderstood Mr Ferdinand to have used the word 'black' or any other word beginning with 'B' that had any reference to, or context with, skin colour, race or ethnicity\".</p> <p>They were equally dismissive of Barnard, finding \"significant doubts about the case that [his] statement advances\". They described his recollections as \"materially defective\".</p> <p>Barnard made no comment at Chelsea's Cobham training ground on Friday but it is believed that the club's hierarchy consider him to have done nothing wrong. They accept that his role in Cole's interview statement was to facilitate and act as a type of middle-man, even if the seniority of his position would tend to suggest he would always be more than a mere mediator.</p> <p>A Chelsea spokesman confirmed the club's position on Barnard and Cole. \"David co-operated fully with the FA at all times,\" he said. \"He stands by his evidence and does not accept the criticism that has been made. It should also be noted that David was not given the opportunity to give oral evidence to the commission, so we feel any criticism is unjustified. With Ashley Cole, he, too, co-operated at all times with the FA and stands by the evidence that he gave. He does not accept the criticism that has been made.\"</p> <p>Cole, though, reacted furiously when he learned of the commission's comments about him and he took to his Twitter account immediately to attack the Football Association, which, given his status as an established England international, was ill-advised, to say the least. His hash-tag was inflammatory. \"Hahahahaa, well done #fa I lied did I, #BUNCHOFTWATS,\" he tweeted.</p> <p>Cole sent his tweet at 12.51pm, shortly after he finished training and, undeniably, in the \"heat of the moment\". He later deleted it and issued a profuse apology, which quashed the notion that he might be considering following Terry into international retirement. Cole has 98 caps and stands to reach his century in the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against San Marino and Poland. Chelsea, though, are still expected to discipline him for breaching their guidelines on communications and social media.</p> <p>\"I had just finished training and saw the captions on the TV screens in the treatment rooms about what was said in the FA Commission ruling about me,\" Cole said. \"I was really upset and tweeted my feelings in the heat of the moment. I apologise unreservedly for my comment about the FA.\"</p> <p>Cole's tweet came six minutes into Roberto Di Matteo's press conference, which was, ostensibly, to preview the Premier League visit of Norwich City on Saturday but, as ever, on-pitch matters were lower down the agenda. Di Matteo squirmed as he became embroiled in a breaking news story in front of live TV cameras and uncomfortable questions were hurled at him; among them, \"Roberto, are your players out of control?\"</p> <p>Di Matteo said: \"Players need to realise that tweets can be viewed by anybody and have to be responsible with that,\" and he closed ranks, yet again, around Terry, even though it was clear that he would have loved to talk about football and, perhaps, how Chelsea are unbeaten and top of the league. \"From my judgment on this man [Terry] \u2026 I've known him for many, many years since we played together and I have never had any doubt about the fact that his comments wouldn't be in any way discriminatory against any kind of ethnic party.\"</p> <p>The manager did speak in general terms about heat-of-the-moment reactions in top-level sport and the need for society as a whole to behave better. \"Sometimes, when you're pushed to the edge of your abilities, you might react in a way that you wouldn't expect,\" he said. \"Even people who are very rational and composed, can lose their composure a little bit during a game. We have to improve on respecting each other in general. It's a deeper issue, not just with footballers.\"</p>",
  "<h2><strong>I think a job offer was withdrawn because of the colour of my skin</strong></h2> <p><strong>I was made a verbal offer of employment by a pharmaceutical company about two weeks ago. I had five interviews and a long assessment to discover competencies, and was told I did very well indeed.</strong></p> <p><strong>After discussing salary, grade, location etc, as well as training events I was to attend, I was asked to have a meeting with the vice president \u2013 and assured this was not another interview. Two days later the company revoked its offer.</strong></p> <p><strong>I believe this is because the vice president did not like the \"look\" of me: I have a \"white\" name but I am a brown person. I also think he made calls to my previous colleagues and discovered I was seriously ill last year and am registered as physically disabled. I did not mention my disability as it would not impact on my role, but am convinced they found out.</strong></p> <p><strong>The company revoked the offer verbally two weeks after planning my induction. Is there anything I can do about this? I have nothing in writing but a lot of details from meetings held and phone calls made.</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>You ask if there is anything you can do about this. If you mean, do you have the right or the power to oblige this company to reinstate its original offer, I am pretty certain the answer is no. (As the base of this column makes clear every week, I am not able to get into questions of employment law.) But you have every right to ask this company what made it change its mind \u2014 and you certainly should. Before you do so, however, bear a couple of things in mind.</p> <p>You've already constructed two possible explanations in your own head. First, you believe the VP took against you because you surprised him by being brown skinned. It is, of course, possible, and you may well have encountered clear examples of racial discrimination before. But in this instance your appearance was well-known to the company: you had successfully survived five face-to-face interviews and a lengthy assessment centre session. So I have to say this suspicion may well be unfounded. Furthermore, even to hint to the company that this was the reason for your offer being withdrawn would not only be unverifiable, but could well cause some offence.</p> <p>Your second suspicion is in fact more than a suspicion: you're \"convinced\" they revoked the offer because they found out you have a serious illness and have been registered physically disabled.</p> <p>When applying for this job you chose not to disclose your disability on the grounds it wouldn't impact your role. You may well be right. But most potential employers, I think, would want to have a say in such a decision; they would see themselves as having a more definitive idea of the role than any applicant. So it could well be that the reason for their change of mind was not the fact of the disability itself, but the fact that as they later discovered you hid it from them.</p> <p>For all these reasons, when approaching the company for an explanation, do be certain to do so in a genuinely open spirit, free from insinuation.</p> <p>Remind them that you were told you did very well indeed in the assessment centre and had clear competencies for the role.</p> <p>Remind them, also, that it's a job you would love to do and feel confident you would do well. Make it clear that you are not challenging the decision to withdraw the offer, but asking, very politely, if perhaps there has been some misunderstanding that might be cleared up by another conversation.</p> <p><strong>Readers say</strong></p> <p>\u2022 The fact you have a disability wouldn't be the issue; the fact you hadn't disclosed it might have! It is unlikely you will ever know the real reason and I would suggest that you move on and look at it as their loss. <strong>monasser48</strong></p> <p>\u2022 A similar thing happened to me. I was told I had a job and that a quick chat with the CEO was routine \u2013 after the chat the role was withdrawn, apparently because I wasn't the right cultural fit. I am a white woman in my 30s, if it matters. In terms of what you can do, it's a real judgment call. Is your industry the type where word would get round that you are a troublemaker? If so, then I would leave it. <strong>RoseJelly</strong></p> <p>\u2022 You are contemplating taking an action which, in all likelihood, will impact on your future employabliity within your sector. Invest a few hundred pounds in a consultation with a reputable employment lawyer. <strong>prezzasknob</strong></p> <h2><strong>When is it best to bring up part-time working during an interview?</strong></h2> <p><strong>I have been offered an interview for a civil service post. The advert stated that the company would consider a part-time, job-share, flexible-working or full-time appointment. I would really like this kind of work as it is rare in my region. I don't want to put myself at a disadvantage compared to other candidates. I am looking after my son fulltime. Childcare is difficult to find and I would ideally like, if offered the position, to work part-time to begin with, and then full-time when my son is older. He is nearly four. Should I mention the subject at interview or wait until I am offered a position? </strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>Recruiting employers, though they may not always seem so, are only human. They want to take on people who are wholeheartedly enthusiastic about the job. They want to be wanted. The danger of an applicant raising the question of part-time working too early is that, however reasonable, it can give an impression of half-heartedness. I know it shouldn't be like that, but wherever there are more well-qualified candidates than there are jobs \u2013 which is nearly always the case \u2013 even the slightest doubt can be enough to count against them.</p> <p>In your case, the good news is that the possibility of part-time working is already on the table. By not raising it until the subject comes up naturally, you don't run any risk of being thought to have concealed anything. What you need to concentrate on, to the exclusion of all else, is making yourself a desirable candidate. Don't dwell on your personal circumstances: when they know they want to offer you a job, that's the time to agree an arrangement.</p> <p><strong>Readers say</strong></p> <p>\u2022 As an ex-civil servant, I would definitely only mention this after you have been offered the position. They have to want you first, before you start negotiating on terms and conditions.<strong> nizz</strong></p> <p>\u2022 They've already introduced the possibility of part-time work, so go to the interview and wow them with your abilities.

  "<p>The car insurance market is broken. As a country, we're paying around \u00a310bn a year to insure our cars, and billions of that is wasted. According to the AA, drivers in Britain fork out an average of nearly \u00a31,000 each to insure their cars, up from around \u00a3350 in 1994. Those figures include everyone from 17 upwards, which is why they seem so high \u2013 most middle-aged people pay closer to \u00a3500-\u00a3700. Yet it's evident that car insurance has shot far ahead of inflation and earnings, despite the fact that (a) we're having fewer serious car accidents and fatalities almost year in, year out; (b) car crime has collapsed; and (c) car prices have fallen.</p> <p>One of the fantastic things about Britain is how few people die on our roads \u2013 just 1,900 last year, with 23,000 serious injuries. In 1990, it was 5,217 dead and 60,000 more seriously injured, while in 1966, the worst year, we killed 7,985 people on the roads. In France, the figures are double ours.</p> <p>Now let's look at car theft and vandalism. According to the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-265883\" title=\"\">ONS</a>, the total recorded \"offences against vehicles\" soared in the 1980s, peaking in 1992 at 1.55m. Since then the fall has been astonishing, with just 417,000 offences against vehicles in 2011/12. Even as unemployment has climbed, theft and car crime has continued to fall. So while insurers whip up fear about car crime to justify costly premiums, in fact it's at the lowest level in a generation.</p> <p>What about car prices? A new Ford Focus (\u00a314,000+) costs a lot more than a Ford Cortina in 1980 (\u00a33,475), but in real terms the price of cars has advanced little, if at all. Meanwhile the price of used cars has fallen, both in real and absolute terms. I called webuyanycar for a valuation on my only car, a 51-reg Alfa. It came in below \u00a3400 \u2013 less than I pay for the insurance on it.</p> <p>How did we get to the situation where insurance can cost more than your car? The reality is that the part of the premium that goes to cover accidents and theft keeps falling. Instead we are paying for all the other nonsense now built into your premium \u2013 deliberately bloated repair costs, outrageously priced \"courtesy\" car hire, spurious whiplash claims and burgeoning uninsured losses.</p> <p>The insurance industry wails about it, but is largely at fault itself. It is riddled with perverse incentives, because the person paying the bill often isn't the one managing the repair. If you knock another car, it goes off to their insurer's \"authorised\" repair yard, which, because it's charging your insurer, has no incentive to keep costs under control. Its incentive is the reverse \u2013 it will want to drag out the repair, add in costs and commissions, and offer a ludicrously expensive replacement car while the other one is off the road, and for as long as possible.</p> <p>The Competition Commission has begun an investigation into the car insurance market, but don't hold your breath. We need a fundamental rethink. UK car insurance looks like US healthcare; super-loaded with costs, but with worse outcomes than countries with socialised medicine. Government, rightly, makes car insurance compulsory, but leaves profligate private providers to manage it. How about a National Car Insurance Service?</p>",
  "<p>Testosterone-fuelled young males are, all the statistics suggest, a danger on the road. Thrill-seeking young men are prone to drive too fast, late at night, and cause horrific fatalities. Young males are 10 times more likely to be killed or injured than a driver aged over 35. The typical insurance claim by a young male adds up to around \u00a34,500, compared with \u00a31,200 when the driver is middle-aged, whether male or female.</p> <p>It's the main reason men pay around 40% more than women for car insurance until the age of 40, when accident rates and claims tend to equalise between the sexes. Yet from 21 December, insurers will be banned from taking gender into consideration when setting premiums \u2013 and women will pick up the tab.</p> <p>According to the AA, the typical insurance premium for a male aged 17-22 is now above \u00a33,000, while for a female it is \u00a32,125. Men aged 23-29 pay an average of \u00a31,840, compared with \u00a31,200 for women. Only once men reach the age of 40 do their premiums come down to the same level as women (at around \u00a3700-\u00a3750).</p> <p>What will happen when the directive comes into force? According to Gocompare.com, Britain's women are in for a shock. Most are unaware of the ruling and the huge impact it is likely to have. Gocompare's head of motor insurance, Scott Kelly, says: \"We expect to see premiums equalised at the higher male rate rather than the lower rate for females. If that is the case, women drivers will see their premiums rise by just over \u00a3300 on average, but for younger age groups the increase could be as much as \u00a32,000.\"</p> <p>The scale of the premium increase \u2013 on top of the inflation-busting rises of recent years \u2013 means some young women who do not have to renew their insurance until January may save money by terminating their policy before the year end and starting a new one before 21 December.</p> <p>But for older women, as Michael Winner might say, it's a case of \"calm down, dear...\" Unisex insurance rates will have virtually no impact on men and women above 40-45 as they are already treated as near identical risks at that age. Indeed, there may even be a very small bonus: the AA's figures suggest that women over 50 pay about \u00a310 a year more in car insurance than men, so they may be in line for a small reduction. Young men will also benefit, with estimates that they will see 10% or more clipped off their premiums.</p> <p>For now, the major insurers are silent about how they will price their policies for the unisex era. Money asked Direct Line and Aviva for quotes, but they refused to give specific figures, citing competition reasons.</p> <p>Aviva would only go so far as saying: \"Young males are likely to see their premiums fall, and young female drivers are likely to see their motor premiums rise.\" At Direct Line, Gus Park, director of motor insurance, said: \"We were disappointed with the ruling, but now it is going to become law we're focused on minimising the impact of the gender directive. It's hard to be sure what is going to happen to prices within the market. Many customers will not be adversely affected. However, people shouldn't panic; they should wait for their renewal quote from their insurer and contact them if they have any concerns.\"</p> <p>Many people will be justified in asking why the insurers don't just split the difference, with male and female insurance rates equalising halfway between the current rates. But Kelly explains: \"If a 20-year-old male is being correctly priced for the risk he presents, then the insurer won't want to charge less than that. Instead, women will have to be charged more.\"</p> <p>However that would suggest a huge surge in revenue for car insurance companies from their female customers. In reality, the Association of British Insurers doesn't believe all premiums will rise to the higher male rate, though it does think they will head that way. Overall, it reckons premiums for males will fall by up to 10%, but rise for females by around 25%.</p> <p>A research paper for the ABI last year argued that the ban on the use of gender will result in an overall loss for consumers, as insurers will have less risk-based information to go on and will thus charge more overall. It also said the ban will not mean all women and men pay the same. \"For example, a 27-year-old male driver from Swindon who drives a 2-litre BMW, and travels 15,000 miles each year, would need to be offered the same premium as a 27-year-old female driver from Swindon who drives a 2-litre BMW and travels 15,000 miles each year. This does not mean that, on average, male drivers in the insurer's book would be charged the same premiums as females.\"</p> <p>But one thing insurers can't do is ignore the ruling. The ABI fought a long battle to maintain insurers' exemption from EU gender equality rules, but were finally defeated in a European Court of Justice ruling in March last year. The court gave insurers until 21 December to bring in unisex rates, with the biggest impact expected in Britain, Spain and Ireland, where gender-based pricing is most commonly used.</p> <p>Ian Crowder, a spokesman for AA insurance says: \"The ruling abandoned fairness in favour of equality. We were one of the voices saying it shouldn't happen, but it has, the ECJ has ruled, and that's now the end of the debate.\"</p> <p>Supporters of the ruling argue it was never fair that gender should have come into premium calculations \u2013 plenty of young males are safe, cautious drivers, and plenty of young females are tearaways. Why should either be judged on gender? Instead, what the ruling is likely to spark is a switch to \"telematics\", where your premium is based on the data transmitted from a mini-computer in your car, which will record when you drive, where, and at what speed, as well as how hard you brake, or even corner. That may mean young males will still be charged a lot more than young females, but it will be because of driving profile, not gender.</p> <p>Telematics, also known as \"pay as you drive\", is still in its infancy in the UK, making up only 3% of motor policies sold so far, and an early experiment by Aviva was less than successful. But as young females in particular face much steeper premiums, more will be tempted to opt for insurance based on telematics. A telematics deal usually starts off as relatively expensive, but as data builds up about the driver's habits and style, safe driving is rewarded by lower costs, with potential premium refunds. As Coverbox, a telematics insurer, says: \"The box also allows us to check your miles, the times driven, where you keep the car overnight, and if it is different then we can decrease or increase the premium accordingly during the year.\"</p> <p>Aviva is trialling a telematics \"app\" called RateMyDrive on smartphones, which can monitor acceleration, braking and cornering as well as the number of miles driven and the car's location. Safer drivers will be offered discounts of up to 20% off their insurance, although currently the trial is limited to 5,000 motorists.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the EU gender directive affects all insurance products, not just car insurance. So from 21 December it will be illegal to use gender as a basis for discriminating in the pricing of pension annuities and life insurance. Women will again lose on life insurance; historically they pay lower premiums as they enjoy longer life expectancy. But there is a small payback when they hit pensionable age. Currently women receive lower annuities than men because they live longer, but the ruling will mean women may have to be given higher pension incomes.</p>",
  "<p>So we packed the baby and entire house into the car and drove \u2013 gingerly, as we couldn't see out of any of the windows \u2013 off for a week in north Norfolk. Toryboy and I have gone every year for almost a decade now and I love it. For those of you who haven't had the pleasure \u2013 imagine an entire county run by John Lewis. That's Norfolk. North Norfolk is Waitrose. Everything is lovely. You can't get a bad meal. Every other village has a secondhand bookshop. Nobody plays loud music, has screaming rows or manifests any form of human awfulness in public. Nor, probably, in private. It's like being on a Thorazine drip. Nothing bad happens here. Nothing bad could ever happen here.</p> <p>Normally, I spend the week in a&#xa0;happy haze, buying books and eating prawns, but this time our visit has a deeper purpose. Toryboy wants us all to move to the country. He has always said so and I've always agreed, mostly because I never thought he could be serious. This is because I grew up in the suburbs and still think of the countryside as a big park. Secretly, I believe that the rolling fields and tangled hedgerows come to an end at a big wire fence erected just beyond every horizon, punctuated with gates staffed by cheery volunteers in hi-vis jackets waving people in and out, ensuring no overcrowding and occasionally pointing the way to the nearest public lavatory. Sometimes I&#xa0;glance down at my arm and am surprised not to&#xa0;see a&#xa0;wristband allowing me entrance for the day, or find myself rifling through my purse for a&#xa0;parking ticket to check what time we have to leave.</p> <p>You can visit a&#xa0;big park. With the right equipment and temperament you can even stay a night or two. But you can't live in one.</p> <p>I always, as a child, wanted to live in the countryside, of course. There would be something wrong with a&#xa0;child who didn't want to live somewhere that was the exact opposite of the place in which his or her parents had chosen to raise their ungrateful spawn (\"chosen\" in the adult sense of the word, meaning \"forced by the inexorable agglomeration of compromises necessitated by the pressures of work, personal commitments, duties, conscience, moral, professional and a variety of other factors too numerous and subtle to allow for full or easy explanation here\"). I wanted to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/nov/01/milly-molly-mandy-stories\" title=\"\">Milly-Molly-Mandy</a> as much as the next pallid bookworm, but now all I&#xa0;think about when I read about someone living in a little white cottage with a thatched roof is how much it must cost to repair. And I'd have to bake cakes for the sodding village fete instead of winning fairy dolls, which would really take the shine off things.</p> <p>But of course it's not about me any more, godammit. It's about my own ungrateful spawn. Do I want him to grow up with dog shit on the pavements as I did, or the rich smell of manure rising from a&#xa0;picturesque agrarian landscape, like his father? Bright lights, big city and manifold dangers, or safety, quietude and self-harming from boredom? What if the child isn't a reader? What if he wants to, you know, do things? Meet people? Meet people different from him? When Milly-Molly-Mandy hit pubescence, was she still content with village fetes, mustard and cress competitions, and baking potatoes on Bonfire Night? No, I don't think we can do this. I don't think we can do this at all.</p>",

  "<p>This summer's weather may not have suited us all, but it doesn't seem to have bothered the bunnies. Bolstered by&#xa0;all that lush, green, rain-induced fecundity, they seem to be doing very well indeed. And when I&#xa0;see those fluffy white cotton tails bouncing about in such abundance, I can't help but lick my lips.</p> <p>I've long been a huge fan of rabbit in the kitchen (I'm less keen on them in the kitchen garden). It's cheap, lean and very tasty. It's also sustainable and truly wild, having lived the life nature intended. Killing and preparing rabbits requires some skill, so they're still the preserve of the hunter and traditional butcher, rather than the factory farm and supermarket. (You can get farmed rabbit, but it's attended by welfare issues similar to those for intensively bred chicken.) The fact that it's still something of a minority meat is, I&#xa0;think, down to rabbit's appearance rather than its taste. A&#xa0;skinned rabbit looks like a naked version of the creature it is, with its very obvious bone structure; it may also reveal a dark patch of blood in the meat \u2013 a reminder of how it met its end. This is a food that requires you to acknowledge you are eating an animal. That's a good thing: if an oven-ready chicken looked more like, well, a chicken, more of us might choose the free-range option.</p> <p>To get the best from a bunny, you need to understand its character. What you shouldn't expect is meat that oozes with moisture \u2013 there's not a lot of spare fat on a rabbit. So, while it's not hard to make it tender and delicious, it does require some well-chosen lubricants. Fatty bacon or pancetta is the default addition to stews (or to wrap round young rabbit for roasting), but yoghurt, cream and coconut milk are nifty, too. What you always get in spades is flavour, with a&#xa0;hint of gaminess and that lovely, herbal undertone from wild animals that have foraged widely.</p> <p>Because of its leanness, the fail\u2011safe way to cook rabbit is slowly and carefully. Stews and braises are good treatments, and gentle cooking is key to tenderise the meat: be a&#xa0;bunny simmerer, not a bunny boiler. Fast, hot roasting is more risky \u2013 it will work with a bacon-barded young bunny, but that's not always easy to identify unless you've shot it yourself.</p> <p>Because of this uncertainty of age and therefore toughness, cooking times will vary, even for a stew \u2013 you need to check on the tenderness of the meat as it cooks. Some rabbit is tender in an hour, but a tough old buck may take upwards of two.</p> <p>And if those bones bother you, just remove them. In fact, many of my favourite bunny recipes call for jointed pieces of rabbit to be cooked, then the meat stripped from the bones and returned to the pie, p\u00e2t\u00e9, stew or sauce. It's an easy job, if a slightly messy one: just roll up your sleeves and enjoy a bit of truly hands-on cookery.</p> <h2>Rabbit rillettes with apple relish</h2> <p>Rillettes are a sort of coarse p\u00e2t\u00e9. This rabbit version is amazingly easy, a lot less fatty than some, and extremely tasty. Serves six to eight.</p> <p><strong>500g rindless, fatty pork belly, cut&#xa0;into 2-3cm cubes</strong><br><strong>1 rabbit, jointed</strong><br><strong>1 good sprig fresh thyme</strong><br><strong>3 bay leaves</strong><br><strong>1 whole head garlic, cut in half through the centre</strong><br><strong>Sea salt and freshly ground black&#xa0;pepper</strong><br><strong>1 good pinch ground mixed spice</strong><br><strong>1 good pinch ground mace</strong></p> <p>For the apple relish<br><strong>1 large cooking apple (a bramley, say), peeled, cored and finely chopped</strong><br><strong>1 shallot, peeled and finely chopped</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp cider vinegar</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp olive or rapeseed oil</strong><br><strong>1 tsp sugar</strong></p> <p>Heat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Put the pork belly and rabbit pieces in a casserole dish or roasting tin into which they'll fit snugly in a single layer. Add the herbs and garlic, pour over 250ml water and cover with a&#xa0;lid or foil. Roast for 30 minutes, then turn down the heat to 140C/285F/gas mark 1 and cook for two and a half hours more, until the rabbit is tender and can be shredded with a fork.</p> <p>Remove from the oven and leave until cool enough to handle. Pull all the rabbit meat off the bones, discard the bones, then shred the meat with a pair of forks or your hands. Put it in a large bowl. Shred the pork, too, in whichever way you find easiest, making sure you include all the fat, and add to the bowl. Work the two meats together, crushing the pork fat thoroughly into the mix so it is evenly spread. Add plenty of salt and pepper \u2013 you'll need in the region of half a teaspoon of salt \u2013 the mixed spice and mace, and some cooking liquor from the casserole. Stir, and add more liquid as necessary, until the mix is a coarse, fairly loose p\u00e2t\u00e9 texture. You may not need all the liquor. Taste, add seasoning or spices as needed and transfer to a bowl or jar. Cover and refrigerate for a day or two \u2013 this helps improve the flavour.</p> <p>To make the relish, combine all the ingredients in a small pan, bring to a simmer and cook for a minute or two. Leave to cool, then season and add more sugar or vinegar to taste. Serve the rillettes cold or at room temperature, with good bread and the apple relish alongside.</p> <h2>Tandoori rabbit</h2> <p>An unusual and delicious way to serve rabbit legs, and a good option if you want to cook rabbit quickly (use the other meat from your bunny in either of this week's other two recipes). Serves six as a starter.</p> <p><strong>6 rear rabbit legs (ideally from a&#xa0;young animal)</strong><br><strong>Juice of 1 lemon</strong><br><strong>1 thumb-sized piece root ginger, peeled and roughly chopped</strong><br><strong>3 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped</strong><br><strong>1 green chilli, finely chopped</strong><br><strong>1 bunch fresh coriander, leaves picked and stalks roughly chopped </strong><br><strong>2 heaped tbsp bought tandoori paste</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp roughly chopped mint</strong><br><strong>1 tsp garam masala</strong><br><strong>1 tsp ground cumin</strong><br><strong>1 tsp ground turmeric</strong><br><strong>1 tsp chilli powder</strong><br><strong>350ml plain, full-fat yoghurt </strong><br><strong>2 tbsp sunflower oil</strong><br><strong>Sea salt and freshly ground black&#xa0;pepper</strong></p> <p>Slash the meat on the rabbit legs and toss them in the lemon juice. Put the ginger, garlic, chilli and coriander stalks in a small food processor and blitz to a paste, adding a little water if necessary (alternatively, crush everything using a pestle and mortar). Combine the resultant paste with the tandoori paste, mint, garam masala, cumin, turmeric and chilli powder, then stir into the yoghurt. Stir in the oil and season with black pepper. Toss the rabbit legs in the mixture, making sure they are well covered, cover and refrigerate for at least a few hours, ideally overnight.</p> <p>Next day, sprinkle the legs with a&#xa0;little salt, then cook under a&#xa0;very hot grill or on a hot barbecue for eight to 10 minutes a side, or until cooked through. Turn them a few times during cooking, and baste with the yoghurty marinade. Alternatively, bake in a hot oven \u2013 around 200C/400F/gas mark 6 \u2013 for about 25 minutes, until cooked through. Scatter over the coriander leaves and serve with naan bread.</p> <h2>Rabbit pie with mushrooms and cider</h2> <p>A good old-fashioned pie is a&#xa0;great way to enjoy rabbit. This takes a little time, but it's very straightforward. Serves six.</p> <p><strong>2 tbsp olive, rapeseed or sunflower oil</strong><br><strong>200g streaky bacon (a whole piece, if possible), cut into chunky dice </strong><br><strong>2 rabbits, jointed</strong><br><strong>250ml dry cider</strong><br><strong>2 stems celery, chopped</strong><br><strong>1 large onion, peeled and chopped</strong><br><strong>2 carrots, peeled and chopped </strong><br><strong>1 bay leaf</strong><br><strong>250g mushrooms, thickly sliced</strong><br><strong>10g butter</strong><br><strong>10g plain flour</strong><br><strong>About 225g puff pastry</strong><br><strong>Beaten egg</strong></p> <p>Heat a tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan and fry the bacon gently until nicely browned. Scoop out the bacon, leaving most of the fat in the frying pan, and add it to a large casserole or stockpot. Season the rabbit pieces and brown them a few at a time in the bacon fat, transferring them to the pot as you go. Tip out any excess fat from the frying pan and deglaze the pan with cider, scraping up any tasty bits from the base. Tip into the rabbit pot, add the celery, onion, carrot and bay, and squash everything down as much as possible to minimise the amount of water you'll need to add. Pour on enough water just to cover the meat, then bring gently to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat and simmer very gently for about an hour, until the meat is tender and comes easily from the bone. (Or do this in a low oven \u2013 about 140C/285F/gas mark 1.)</p> <p>Fish out the pieces of rabbit and bacon, and set aside. While the rabbit is still warm, pick off all the meat with your fingers, breaking it up into generous pieces, and combine in a bowl with the bacon.</p> <p>The stock left in the pot should be tasty and rich \u2013 if not, boil it to reduce it until it tastes good to you. Measure out 500ml of the stock.</p> <p>Heat a tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat, add the sliced mushrooms and fry briskly until the liquid they release is driven off and they are starting to brown. Add these to the rabbit bowl.</p> <p>In the same pan, over medium-low heat, add the butter and, once it's foaming, the flour. Stir to make a&#xa0;smooth roux, cook for a few minutes, then add the 500ml stock a little at a time, stirring well after each addition, to create a smooth gravy. Let it simmer for a few minutes. Taste and season as needed.</p> <p>Put the rabbit mixture into a pie dish and pour in the hot gravy. Roll out the pastry. Brush the rim of the pie dish with beaten egg, put the pastry on top, press down at the edges and trim off any excess. Brush the top of the pastry with more beaten egg, cut a couple of steam holes, then bake at 190C/375F/gas mark 5 for 30 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown and the filling bubbling. Serve piping hot with potatoes \u2013 mashed or boiled \u2013 and a green veg such as kale.</p> <p>\u2022 For the latest news from River Cottage HQ, go to <a href=\"http://www.rivercottage.net\" title=\"\">rivercottage.net</a></p> <p>Hugh's new book, Three Good Things, is published by Bloomsbury at \u00a325.

  "<p>The gates outside <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/charlotte-church\" title=\"\">Charlotte Church</a>'s house are huge, heavy and automated. I press the intercom, but there is no answer. So I stare through the slats up the long, winding drive and acres of garden. There is no sign of the house. This is about as private as private residences get.</p> <p>Once you know about Church's history, it begins to make sense. It's not that the former child singer announced she wanted to be alone and retreated from the world. Far from it: she loved her friends, her family, and was wedded to her community in Cardiff. No, Church was hounded into privacy. This is the girl for whom a clock was devised, counting down to her 16th birthday, when she would be \"legal\"; who was labelled promiscuous despite the fact that, at 26, she says she still has only ever had four boyfriends. This is the girl portrayed as a&#xa0;chav, a binge drinker, a fallen angel, a symbol of everything wrong with modern Britain. For others in her family, it was even worse. In February this year, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/feb/23/charlotte-church-phone-hacking-case\" title=\"\">Church and her parents accepted \u00a3600,000 in damages and costs after Rupert Murdoch's News International admitted that Church's voicemail messages were targeted repeatedly over a number of years</a>, and that it had unlawfully obtained and published private medical information about her and her mother.</p> <p>Given all that, perhaps the only surprise is that the gates aren't topped with barbed wire. Eventually, they open slowly, and ominously. I&#xa0;walk up the drive, half expecting to&#xa0;be frisked by heavies, but there's just a gardener mowing the lawn. So&#xa0;I walk some more, past kids' toys and footballs and a wendy house. \"Hi-yyyaa,\" Church shouts. She's in tracky bottoms, scruffy T-shirt, no makeup, chipped nails, and looks perfectly lovely.</p> <p>At an age when many young people are still living with their parents or dusting away their student days, Church has lived a dauntingly full life. It's not just the 10m records she had sold by 2007, nor the \u00a325m she was said to be worth in 2003 (now down to an estimated \u00a310m), nor her stint as <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-charlotte-church-show\" title=\"\">a very funny chatshow host</a> when she had just turned 20; it's also the relationship with rugby player <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/gavin-henson\" title=\"\">Gavin Henson</a>, their two children, the separation, the way she combines motherhood with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/25/charlotte-church-review\" title=\"\">a new music career as an indie rocker</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/nov/28/leveson-inquiry-witnesses-smears-lies\" title=\"\">her impressive appearance in front of the Leveson inquiry</a> into hacking and, as a result, now her role as a patron of the pressure group <a href=\"http://hackinginquiry.org/\" title=\"\">Hacked Off</a>.</p> <p>A week earlier, we had met at a Rough Trade shop in east London, where she was showcasing her new EP. The audience was 30-strong, and seemed to consist mainly of people who worked in the shop and Church's friends \u2013 it couldn't have been further removed from the height of her teen fame, when she performed for the Pope or in front of 20,000 at the Hollywood Bowl. She sang half a dozen songs barefoot on a tiny stage, accompanied by a band (including her boyfriend on guitar), screaming, screeching, whispering and harmonising \u2013 part Bj\u00f6rk, part Radiohead \u2013 and having the time of her life. A pattern soon emerged. \"This is one I wrote after reading a piece in the Daily Mail,\" she said. \"Needless to say, I was pissed off.\" Then she introduced us to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGLIk4BPPWc\" title=\"\">Beautiful Wreck</a>, a song about exploitation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397595246\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349276069068/Charlotte-Church-1999-008.jpg\" alt=\"Charlotte Church, 1999\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Church in Voice Of An Angel in 1999. Photograph: George Bodnar </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Church's story was always going to be tabloid gold \u2013 the working-class Welsh girl who sang like an angel and would be our own <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Callas\" title=\"\">Maria Callas</a>. Even better, it was a story peopled with irresistible characters \u2013 the pushy mum, the father who wasn't the biological father, the grandad who played guitar and had met the Beatles, the aunt who fancied her chances at stardom, the tough manager, the liability boyfriends, and on it went.</p> <p>I once read an interview with Church when she was 14 in which the writer described her as \"the most fearsomely balanced, joined-up teenager you could meet\". I ask her if that rings true. She nods. \"Yeah, yeah. Fearsomely balanced \u2013 because you've got to work to maintain any sort of balance.\" Even when she was at her most exposed, she says, she never considered herself unbalanced. \"I've never been off the rails in my entire life.\"</p> <p>Right from the off, she was misrepresented, she says. We were led to believe she was fantastically ambitious, and her mother even more so. Rubbish, Church says. The only reason she got noticed in the first place was because she turned up with her aunt, who was taking part in a talent contest. When she did become successful, the story is that it ruined her. Again, she says, that's rubbish. She had a wonderful time \u2013 travelling the world, always with her mother, Maria, in Washington one day, at&#xa0;the Vatican the next. She even sat one of her GCSEs in the White House, where she had been performing for <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/1125614.stm\" title=\"\">George Bush's inauguration</a> and wondered why there were so many protestors. Looking back now, she says, it's not her proudest moment politically, but it was still thrilling.</p> <p>And when she wasn't gigging, she was back at school leading a normal life. Did the other kids bully her about her fame? You've got to be joking, she says. They couldn't care less, and they were her mates, anyway. \"You can't forget how self-involved teenagers are. I was 14 and doing massive concerts and selling shit-tonnes of albums, and I'd get back and they'd be like, 'Whatever\u2026 So-and-so snogged so-and-so the other week,' who was going out with so-and-so. They'd fill me in on everything that was going on. That was the most important thing.\" Things couldn't have been better, she says.</p> <p>So what did go wrong? In 2000, her mother sacked her manager <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/jul/10/jonathan-shalit-mediaguardian-100-2009\" title=\"\">Jonathan Shalit</a>; he eventually received an estimated \u00a32m in an out-of-court settlement. The press monstered Maria. \"That was when it turned, and I thought, this is really ugly.\"</p> <p>Church insists her mother was simply looking after her \u2013 she claims Shalit exploited her financially (he received 40% of her royalties from record sales) and says she did not enjoyed dealing with him. \"He was just\u2026 odd. I said to my mother, 'If I&#xa0;have to work with that man another day, I'm not singing another note,' and she said, 'OK.' The press turned it into this stereotypical situation where she was the pushy mother.\"</p> <p>But Maria wasn't portrayed simply as pushy, but as greedy and mad, too, wasn't she? \"Yes. But what she essentially was is strong as hell, because she wasn't going to let anyone overwork me or not let me have a normal childhood. They called her the Welsh dragon, and she was a dragon in a certain sense, but it was only to protect her young.\"</p> <p>By this time, Church had already found herself in a compromising clinch with the tabloid press. At 13, she was asked to sing at Rupert Murdoch's wedding in New York. Her management was told she could either be paid \u00a3100,000 or she \"would be looked upon favourably by Mr Murdoch's papers\". It sounds like an episode of the Sopranos, I say.</p> <p>She smiles. \"It is very mob, isn't it? I didn't have a clue who he was. I was told he's a really important man, he'll be able to help your career, and that didn't even matter to me. I wasn't ambitious. I've never been ambitious.\"</p> <p>She was flown from LA to New York on Murdoch's private jet. \"It was unbelievable. The taps were gold.\" What was the wedding like? \"I thought everybody looked ridiculous because they had all this finery on, but no shoes, because it was antique wood on the boat. There was this young bride, Wendi Deng, and I remember thinking, she's really beautiful and he's really old. That is what my 13-year-old brain said to me.\"</p> <p>Murdoch asked her to sing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn4sXY2u9xg\" title=\"\">Pie&#xa0;Jesu</a>, which she did reluctantly after telling his people it was inappropriate. \"I said, 'Well, it's a requiem \u2013 was he sure?' Apparently he was insistent. I&#xa0;remember there were these huge, chocolate-covered strawberries, and he dropped the ring and all his aides came to help him find it \u2013 all these people in their finery with no shoes on searching for a ring!\"</p> <p>When did she find out why she'd performed for him? \"After the event, because I remember this \u00a3100,000 or favours being floated about, and me and my mother were like, 'No way, that's a&#xa0;phenomenal amount of money. No way are we turning that money down. Who is he? Who cares?' I'd much rather have just taken his money and invested it wisely, to be honest.\" She told Lord Leveson that her management persuaded her to accept the promise of favours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397595247\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349276939913/Charlotte-Church-and-Gavi-008.jpg\" alt=\"Charlotte Church and Gavin Henson\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlotte Church with ex-boyfriend Gavin Henson in 2006. Photograph: Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As it happened, News International didn't keep its side of the bargain. So many stories appeared about Church's private life, from the insignificant to the major, that she began to doubt her friends. \"We knew we were watched, there were always journalists outside, whether it was my nan's house, my parents' house, my house. They'd follow me everywhere. We'd say, 'I swear they've got a bug in the house.' But you think that's so far-fetched. It makes you a bit paranoid. You look at people around you, and question everybody.\" She had a&#xa0;close-knit group of friends who had never given her reason to distrust them, but she started to anyway. \"I did cull certain people. I just cut them from my life.\" She says she has recently been back in touch with some of them and apologised.</p> <p>Awful though it was, Church always felt strong enough to look after herself. Yes, she was aware of the countdown clock to her 16th birthday (she says it was in the Sun and on two websites, while the Sun disputes that, saying it merely reported on its existence on a website), but tried to ignore it. \"They were digging on the whole virginity issue\u2026 and the whole of my developing body was just beneath the surface.\" Not that much beneath, I&#xa0;say. \"No, not really,\" she says quietly. \"I read bits and bobs, and it was like, yeuchh.\"</p> <p>How did it make her feel? \"I'm the kind of person who laughs off everything publicly, because I've always been in public and you can't go around wailing. Probably behind closed doors it made me&#xa0;weird out a bit \u2013 to be talked about as a&#xa0;commodity, like you're some kind of geisha.\"</p> <p>It was during this period that she read an interview she had given to the Times in which it was suggested that she had expected red carpet treatment when she visited Ground Zero after 9/11. She was devastated to be portrayed as a callous prima donna, and it didn't do much for her career in America. But she was advised to say nothing, and was determined it would not break her.</p> <p>At 18, she was old enough to drink in a pub, so the press turned her into an alcoholic. Was she drinking? \"Yes!\" She sounds shocked at the idea that she might not have been. \"I was 18, 19. I went to Ibiza on my first holiday with the girls. We were totally reasonable, we had a little villa, we went out, we had a great time. We didn't hurt anyone's feelings, we didn't get into trouble.\" Again, the fallen angel was too good a story to spurn, even if it wasn't true. \"This whole thing was going on at the time \u2013 look at our youth, binge drinking, wasting their lives. It was just a great way to point a finger and make me one of the figureheads.\"</p> <p>Did she ever puke publicly? \"No&#xa0;puking. I fell over on my 18th birthday because there were about 50 photographers in front of me flashing; they'd try to trip you up to&#xa0;get the under-skirt shot, and shout abuse at you to get a reaction.\"</p> <p>A couple of years later, when she was in her first trimester and had not yet told her parents, she read about her pregnancy in the Sun under the headline Church Sober Shock. Again, she found it traumatic, but knew she'd have to make the best of it.</p> <p>It was when newspapers began to pry into the life of her vulnerable mother that she knew things were out of control. In December 2005, the News of the World reported that Maria had attempted suicide. The deliberately misleading front-page splash was \"Church's 3-In-A-Bed Cocaine Shock\", accompanied by a photograph of the singer, while the first sentence read, \"Superstar Charlotte Church's mum tried to kill herself because her husband is a love rat hooked on cocaine and three-in-a-bed orgies.\"</p> <p>In her statement to Leveson, Church said what the paper failed to tell its readers was that the suicide attempt was \"at the very least in part due\u2026 to the fact that she was aware this story was coming out\". Maria went on to further self-harm after the story broke because of the impact it had on her. \"Her main concern was her parents, my grandparents, and the shame of it all \u2013 you know, we come from a Catholic family.\"</p> <p>And the information had been obtained through hacking? \"Yes, that was entirely through hacking. Even our priest was hacked, Father Richard, who was helping both of my parents deal with this at the time.\" Her parents came through it, she says, despite the newspapers.</p> <p>Church is convinced we've not heard the end of hacking \u2013 that there's more to come out. She says so many newspapers wrote stories about her based on private information, and has started digging around herself for clues to their origin.</p> <p>It's almost lunchtime, and Church is driving to the school and nursery where her kids have just started. Does she ever ask herself whether success was worth all this? \"All the time. How do you get out of it? You can't. I didn't really think about not being famous, because I'd hardly known a time I&#xa0;wasn't. I was 12 when it started, so it just felt like, 'This is life, this is what it is.' It wasn't like, 'I can opt out.' I didn't think like that. Now I&#xa0;do. Now I&#xa0;think this is an option; I can disappear.\"</p> <p>Did she consider living in another country? \"This is the thing. The record company wanted me to go to America and my family wanted to go&#xa0;to America, but I didn't. I wanted to stay in Wales where all my family and friends were. I love this country, and I just thought, fuck you, I'm not getting chased out. This is my home.\"</p> <p>She spots one of her friends pushing two babies down the street, beeps at her and opens the window. \"'Kaiiiiiiia! It's me! You OK? Ta-ra.' She's one of my best friends. I went round to hers yesterday. We had a little party with the kids.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397595248\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349276611808/Charlotte-Church-performs-008.jpg\" alt=\"Charlotte Church performs with her band in 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Church plays with her band at an ice-cream parlour in 2012. Photograph: Rex</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In some ways Church is still so girly that it's hard to believe 15 years have passed since her TV debut. At the same time, she seems older than her 26 years. She says she's changed recently. \"You know what? Leveson had a big impact. I&#xa0;became a lot more socially aware, and I'm just much more empowered. Also, putting an end to such a long chapter of my life, it made me a little freer, able to focus and re-evaluate. I've turned into a massive feminist, as well.\"</p> <p>Has motherhood changed her? \"Yeah. I've always been mature, but I think it's made me more emotional and responsible. And more caring. You want to be as safe as you can possibly be, so that when you go this world is OK, bearable, for your children to grow up in.\"</p> <p>Does she share the parenting with Henson? \"We've got a good relationship. We're both going tonight to an introductory parents' evening for the school\u2026 Oh, <em>shiiiiiit!</em> I'm in the wrong lane.\" She apologises to the driver she's heading straight towards. \"Sorrrrrrrry\u2026 Gavin has two overnights a week. It works pretty well when you've got two people who want the best for their children and can leave other baggage behind.\"</p> <p>It's funny, she says, she's so often been headline news, but she actually hates causing a stink. She does have the knack, though, I say. She grins. There's the time, for example, she called the Pope a Nazi, and just recently she referred to the Queen as an \"old woman\" who \"had no idea what's going on\", for which she apologised. \"I really don't like confrontation, believe it or not. I've just got strong opinions\u2026 They're easy to come by.\" Ask her what she thinks and she'll tell you. And sometimes she'll tell you even when&#xa0;you don't.</p> <p>We collect the kids, who have spent the morning making bread and bring their little rolls home. The two are jabbering away in the back of the car. \"Dexter, stop messing with that, please,\" Church says as her three-year-old son contemplates escaping his seat belt. \"Dexter Lloyd!\" Her voice is rising, half cajoling, half threatening.</p> <p>\"You went through a red light,\" five-year-old Ruby says.</p> <p>\"I didn't, darling. It was green, honest.\"</p> <p>We get home and the huge gates slowly open. \"Nilsson!\" she shouts in delight as a labradoodle bounds up to her. \"Niiiiilsson! He's named after the singer Harry Nilsson.\"</p> <p>Church's boyfriend, Jonny Powell, emerges in his pyjamas. He is an old family friend who used to work in her mother's pub. \"Sorry, I'd forgotten you were coming. I would have dressed a little bit more appropriately,\" he says as he shows me round the garage studio.</p> <p>\"He's a scholar, that boy,\" Church says proudly when he disappears. \"He's a smart, smart boy \u2013 he got a scholarship to the Royal College of Music. He's a solo artist, released two albums, brilliant musician, and great with the kids.\" She says she plans to have a couple more children with Powell.</p> <p>In the kitchen, the band are eating sandwiches and discussing everything from American indie band Fatty Acids to string theory and the suicide of novelist David Foster Wallace. We could be in the world's smartest student house. Church always planned to go to university \u2013 when she was young, she wanted to be a vet or a lawyer \u2013 but it never quite worked out. Most of the band have been, and tell her it's not all it's cracked up to be.</p> <p>A couple of weeks later, we meet in a small room above a pub where she is playing that night. The band are chatting away and eating fruit, just as they were round her kitchen table. Church looks happy. She says it's taken a&#xa0;while,&#xa0;but she finally feels she has found herself musically. When I&#xa0;say the music reminds me of&#xa0;a demented Radiohead, she lights up. \"I love that! Thank you! I love Radiohead. Yeah, it's been a long journey, but often I think it takes until you're in your 20s to&#xa0;find your thing.\"</p> <p>Would she enjoy the level of success now that she experienced as a teenager? \"No. You&#xa0;get stalkers and that kind of stuff. I'd love to have a steady, reasonably sized fan base so it's profitable and I can always make music in a&#xa0;way I want to.\" She has an idyllic image of herself making music in the garage while the kids are at school, then touring with the family in school holidays.</p> <p>She's also becoming more active as a patron of&#xa0;Hacked Off, and will be talking at the Conservative party conference this week. It's&#xa0;all&#xa0;very well having an inquiry into press hacking, but it will be of value, she says, only if&#xa0;it leads to&#xa0;change. She insists she would hate to see legislation that muzzled the press, but she&#xa0;does&#xa0;hope that Leveson's report, due later this year, leads to greater accountability. \"What I&#xa0;don't really understand is people saying this will compromise the freedom of the press. Was the press really free before, with such a small amount of people running it? I didn't think I had any freedom of speech. Lots of people didn't.\"</p> <p>Ultimately, she says, she's one of the lucky ones \u2013 she and her family were savaged but have come through it. Plenty don't. \"It's not about Murdoch. It's about the whole industry. I don't want to have to live that way ever again. And I don't think anybody else should have to live like that.\" \u2022</p> <p><strong>Charlotte Church's EP, One, is released by Alligator Wine Records on 15 October.</strong><br>\u2022 This article was edited on 11 October 2012.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.jackwhitehall.com/main/\" title=\"\">Jack Whitehall</a> sits outside a Putney cafe, looking slightly harassed. This is his third attempt at finding an interview venue. The first place he suggested we meet was closed, not unsurprisingly, given that it was a pub and it's 10.30 on a Wednesday morning. So he suggested another pub, also closed. Eventually, he leads me on a lengthy walk to discover somewhere that isn't a pub. Does he know this area? He frowns: yes, he grew up in Putney and still lives here. \"My parents' house is just down there,\" he says, pointing across the road.</p> <p>You could suggest that this is all very Jack Whitehall-ish. He has, after all, made a career out of playing clueless public schoolboys of varying degrees of ghastliness. PJ in <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/fresh-meat\" title=\"\">Fresh Meat</a>, the student sitcom by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/sep/14/peep-show-sam-bain-jesse-armstrong\" title=\"\">Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain </a>of <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/peep-show\" title=\"\">Peep Show</a> fame. Alfie, the recently graduated comprehensive school history teacher in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00vrlrh\" title=\"\">Bad Education</a>, which he wrote himself. Even his standup persona, which plays heavily on his privileged background and his inability to attain the heights of his former fellow pupils at <a href=\"http://www.harrodian.com/\" title=\"\">the Harrodian School</a> and <a href=\"http://www.marlboroughcollege.org/\" title=\"\">Marlborough College</a>: his fury at the ongoing Hollywood success of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2T7d8j6I5I\" title=\"\">Twilight</a> star Robert Pattinson, his mother's disappointment that he failed to marry Kate Middleton. But, of course, Jack Whitehall isn't like them at all. He looks like them \u2013 although the shock of black hair seems a little less vertical offscreen \u2013 and he certainly sounds like them, but in person Whitehall is smart, shrewd and more self-deprecating than you might expect of someone who has his own sitcom on TV at the age of 23. He's also extremely funny, not always a&#xa0;given with comedians offstage. \"I like to think I'm a bit smarter than I sometimes let on.\"</p> <p>But he has, he says, a lot on his mind at the moment. He's in the middle of filming back\u2011to\u2011back episodes of <a href=\"http://sky1.sky.com/sky1hd-shows/a-league-of-their-own\" title=\"\">A League Of Their Own</a>, the sports-based quiz presented by his friend James Corden, on which he's a permanent team member. Last night, one of the guests was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/shane-warne\" title=\"\">Shane Warne</a>, the former Australian cricketer and current fiance of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/elizabeth-hurley\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Hurley</a>. Unaware that Warne had brought his children, Whitehall failed to adjust his material accordingly. \"I just did lots of stuff about\u2026 \" He looks pained\u2026 \"Anal bleaching. Just smutty stuff.\" He shakes his head. \"I've definitely become smuttier. When I&#xa0;first started out, I had these aspirations: I'm not going to do jokes about anything crude because I'm bigger and better than that. But then, I don't know\u2026 It makes me laugh, so I started doing it.\"</p> <p>It's not the first time he's managed to cause offence. One Liverpool player took such exception to jokes about his skills in midfield that he confronted Whitehall at an event in Manchester. \"It was really awkward. He really scared me. He's an athlete, he could definitely floor me if he wanted to. James Corden is very careful not to be rude about people because he sees a lot of them and he's learned this, clearly.\" He sighs. \"I haven't. So I just literally say whatever I want. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/john-terry\" title=\"\">John Terry</a>, I've done so many jokes about. He definitely knows.\"</p> <p>Well, I say, John Terry's probably got bigger fish to fry at the moment. \"True. He's got other problems. I just never want to see him because he could really do me some damage. But I don't want to be nice about everyone. That's boring.\"</p> <p>In addition to worrying about being punched by the former England captain, there's the matter of Whitehall's work schedule, which looks insane. He's just finished working on the second series of Fresh Meat and is about to start writing both a&#xa0;new standup show and the second series of Bad Education. There's A League Of Their Own, of course, which, irate midfielders notwithstanding, he says he enjoys more than the umpteen other panel shows he's appeared on because \u2013 improbably enough, given that it's largely staffed by former sportsmen \u2013 it's not as competitive. \"They're not interrupting you, desperate to get their own material in, it's pretty laid-back. For the first series, me and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/andrew-flintoff\" title=\"\">Freddie Flintoff</a> would just get drunk before filming. We had a thing called Wine Club where we'd have to bring wine to the green room every week before we went on and just get pissed. He used to openly admit to me that there were rounds in the first series of that show that he can't remember filming, and I'm a lightweight, so trying to keep up with him I was even worse. But this series he's gone teetotal because he's decided to become a professional boxer, so it's not been quite as fun.\"</p> <p>He's also just finished a pilot for another comedy panel show, this time about music, co-starring the grime rapper <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/lethalbizzle\" title=\"\">Lethal Bizzle</a>, with whom Whitehall struck up a friendship that even he seems to find a bit implausible. \"Three times I've been walking down the street and he's stopped his car in the middle of the road, and him and four or five other guys in the car have shouted at me. Like, screeched to a halt and they've all started shouting out at me and I've got a shock and been fucking <em>cowering</em>. You can see everyone around looking at the situation like: this is obviously a hit taking place.\"</p> <p>Then there are the projects in collaboration with his father, Michael Whitehall, a theatrical agent who's represented everyone from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/judi-dench\" title=\"\">Judi Dench</a> to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/danieldaylewis\" title=\"\">Daniel Day-Lewis</a>. They're co-authoring a book about fathers and sons, which Whitehall also intends to illustrate. And they're working together on a chatshow, using a format they've tried out at the Edinburgh festival. \"I sort of host, like a normal chatshow host, but then Dad's also ever-present and sits just behind the guests, chipping in when he wants to, mainly taking apart my interview style, criticising me as a person, as a&#xa0;presenter, as an actor, the way I dress, everything. The premise is that I'll invite a guest and he'll invite a guest. So he had <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/eileen-atkins\" title=\"\">Dame Eileen Atkins</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/simon-callow\" title=\"\">Simon Callow</a>, and I had <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/miranda-hart\" title=\"\">Miranda Hart</a>, who he tried to marry me off to, and <a href=\"http://www.louiespence.com/\" title=\"\">Louie Spence</a>, who crawled up on to my dad's chair and danced like a&#xa0;pussycat on his lap. My dad,\" he chuckles, \"his head exploded when that happened.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397235691\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/4/1349366858041/Jack-Whitehall-composite-008.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Whitehall composite\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Whitehall as JP in Fresh Meat, and (right), live on stage. Photograph: Getty </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He says he gets upset when people suggest that his success is based on his parents' showbiz connections: his godparents are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Havers\" title=\"\">Nigel Havers</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Griffiths\" title=\"\">Richard Griffiths</a> \u2013 \"It is a bit weird having <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl4ye22U-E\" title=\"\">Uncle Monty</a> as your godfather, yes\" \u2013 while his mother, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0321089/\" title=\"\">Hilary Gish</a>, was a TV actor. \"It's never people I&#xa0;necessarily respect that much, but it happens on Twitter and internet forums: 'Oh, yeah, Jack's only got to where he is because of his dad.' My dad's burned so many bridges for me. He's sworn at so many casting directors, told so many producers to fuck off. He was a&#xa0;really ruthless agent, he had a&#xa0;reputation that, if anything, has been to my detriment. I used to go for some castings where I&#xa0;thought, well, my only way of getting this is to drop my dad's name. So I'd say, 'My father's Michael Whitehall, who you might know' and there'd be a sort of silence from the casting director. I'd come out and think I'd done quite well, then I'd call my dad up and he'd ask who the casting director was, then say, 'Oh yes, the last time I spoke to her was in 1994, and I&#xa0;told her she could shove her script up her arse.' And I'm like, great, there's another job I won't be getting.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, his parents clearly loom large in both his comedy and his life. His father was apparently rigidly opposed to his son going into showbusiness \u2013 \"He knew how difficult it was, how many good actors he'd looked after who were out of work\" \u2013 but his mother encouraged him to go to auditions while at school, including for the role of Harry Potter: \"I could have been a really good Harry Potter, but they gave it to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/daniel-radcliffe\" title=\"\">Daniel Radcliffe</a>. I'm not bitter.\" Later, she took to driving him to comedy gigs, waiting until his set had finished, then driving him home, but the other comedians mocked him so much that he had to ask her to desist.</p> <p>You can see his parents in the audience on his DVD, gamely laughing along while he talks in considerable detail about the problems of trying to have sex while living under their roof. It looks pretty excruciating to me, but he seems quite equivocal about it. \"They're amazing. They're all right with it.\" He thinks for a moment. \"Well, they say they're all right with it and I don't really know whether they are.\" Anyway, he says, they've seen worse: he invited them to the screening of Fresh Meat's first episode, forgetting that it featured him in a protracted, agonisingly funny sex scene. \"The worst thing about it was I looked over to my dad while it was happening and he had this sort of\u2026 proud look on his face.\" He grimaces.</p> <p>He began working as a standup while still at school. \"I was utterly pants and I thought I was the dog's bollocks. My first few gigs, my friends came to see me and gave me this false sense of security, so I was incredibly confident with terrible material, just poor, sports-based punnery and, like, shitness.\"</p> <p>He got his TV break aged 19, after Corden and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/mathew-horne\" title=\"\">Mathew Horne</a> \"bullied\" the producers of <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/B/bb7_celebrity/bbbm/index.jsp\" title=\"\">Big Brother's Big Mouth</a> into giving him a shot at presenting the show that had previously catapulted <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/russell-brand\" title=\"\">Russell Brand</a> to mainstream fame. \"I used to get a lot of, 'Oh, you're so like Russell Brand.'\" He frowns. \"And then you'd read these stories of him having raucous orgies with all these women and leading this life of excess. I'd be reading these stories, still living at my mum's house, thinking, 'When do I get these perks?'\"</p> <p>The following year, he was nominated for Best Newcomer at the Edinburgh comedy awards. He's keen for his success not to appear too seamless, reeling off tales of awful gigs, including one at the RBS Christmas party in the wake of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/sir-fred-goodwin\" title=\"\">Fred Goodwin scandal</a> and another where an audience member expressed his dissatisfaction with Whitehall's material by climbing on stage and getting him in a headlock. Nevertheless, his rise has been startling. His last tour culminated in two sold-out nights at the Hammersmith Apollo, and he was nominated for both a British comedy award and a Broadcasting Press Guild award for his acting debut in Fresh Meat.</p> <p>He was worried that JP might become a kind of heroic figure to obnoxious public schoolboys, but instead, he says, quite the opposite happened. \"I've been to some things where people have come up and taken issue with me about it. The first time was at a bar in Chelsea where I was with my brother having a drink. Some guy came up to me, wearing a blazer, an open-necked shirt, the reddy-pink trousers they always wear and holding a bottle of Cristal. He said: 'Oh, you're the guy from the Channel 4 thing, you give <a href=\"http://www.stowe.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Stowe</a> a&#xa0;bad name.' I was like, no, it's <em>definitely</em> you that's giving Stowe a bad name. The other time, I&#xa0;was at Lord's with my dad, watching the cricket, and there was a group of posh boys, all drunk, and they started shouting, 'Stowe! Stowe! Stowe!' at me, being all aggressive, because JP was at Stowe and they were clearly at a rival school. I was like, no, I'm not him. Anything he says or does that defames public schools or posh people is Sam and Jessie's fault. I just turn up and say the words.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, he seems to have a certain kind of role sewn up: if you want an insufferable posh divvy, he's very much your go-to guy. He is concerned about being typecast but, he says, \"comedically, when I do a posh divvy projection of myself, or whatever it is, I find it a lot better for finding laughs and making it funnier.\" He sighs. \"I&#xa0;need to learn how to be funny when I'm not being posh I think is the key here.\"</p> <p>You might reasonably think Whitehall is good at playing posh idiots because he met a lot of them over the course of his educational career. But no, he says, quite the opposite. \"I can see where people's perception of public schools comes from, because a lot of people that came from them are dicks, awful people. And a lot of the dicks are quite high-profile dicks, members of the current cabinet and such. Every year, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/apprentice\" title=\"\">The Apprentice</a> will find some public schoolboy and he'll be handpicked to be the biggest cock they could find and completely besmirch everyone that paid for their education. But at Marlborough, me and my friends sort of reacted against it, which I suppose was equally cringe. We all wanted to be MCs. I had,\" he laughs, \"a rap battle on a hockey field. They were rapping with the backdrop of our amazing school chapel and Kate Middleton's boarding house, and I had a moment of self-realisation that maybe this was all a little bit stupid.\"</p> <p>When he started as a comedian, he felt obliged to try to obscure his privileged upbringing: \"There's horrible, horrible footage of me talking all mockney on YouTube,\" he says, looking mortified. \"I was still doing it when I presented Big Brother's Big Mouth: 'You awlright, yeah?'\"</p> <p>Gradually he changed his act to play on rather than deny his background. He seems to feel slightly guilty about the endless bile he directs at Robert Pattinson. \"It all comes from a place of truth. He was in the play I wanted to be in at school, he was always one to watch, my mum talked about him a&#xa0;lot when he was rising up through the ranks and becoming a successful actor, and made it this sort of competition. But I don't have anything against him as an actual person. I really do hope if he sees it, which I'm sure he hasn't \u2013 I'm sure he's busy reading really good scripts and being very successful \u2013 I hope he realises that the joke is definitely on me.\" He thinks for a moment. \"I&#xa0;haven't heard from him, but my mum saw his mum and it was a bit frosty, I think.\"</p> <p>Perhaps he's starting to empathise more with Pattinson, given that he has his own degree of fame to contend with. A couple of years ago, he was caught by the News Of The World snorting a line of coke off his mobile phone at a music festival, which didn't seem to damage his career, but did cause his parents \"a lot of pain and bother\". A few days before I meet him, he's in the papers again, looking quite spectacularly pissed after James Corden's stag do. \"My problem,\" he says, \"is that I don't have the self-control to go, 'Oh, I probably shouldn't get drunk now because I might get photographed.' Whereas all the other people who are sort of older and wiser did. I just thought, 'Fuck it.' I definitely don't want to be that person being photographed stumbling out of <a href=\"http://www.thegrouchoclub.com/\" title=\"\">the Groucho Club</a>. But I do like getting drunk and I'm a massive lightweight, so I need to go to more careful places.\"</p> <p>As if to underline his point, a passerby interrupts to ask for a photo and an autograph. \"My missus watches you all the time,\" he says. \"Bad Behaviour, is it?\" \"Bad Education,\" corrects Whitehall, then turns to me with a smile. \"You see? I'm Billy Big Bollocks. In Putney.\" </p> <p>\u2022 Fresh Meat begins at 10pm on Tuesday 9&#xa0;October on Channel 4.</p>",
  "<p>These are some of the things we know about the&#xa0;rising star of the Tory party. David Cameron's glittering understudy outshone the future PM at Oxford, where he was elected president of the union. During a distinguished career as a political journalist, he became the unlikely star of a satirical TV show, and continued to write a newspaper column after becoming an MP. Affectionately indulged across the Westminster spectrum, on account of his charm, his personal appeal transcends party loyalty. Contrary to popular opinion, however, his name is not Boris Johnson.</p> <p>\"People keep talking about Boris becoming prime minster,\" reflects an Oxford contemporary. \"But I think it's going to be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/michaelgove\" title=\"\">Michael Gove</a>.\"</p> <p>If you have never met the secretary of state for&#xa0;education, and do not vote Tory, you may well be of the view that Gove is a nasty little rightwinger with a reactionary vision to return Britain to the 1950s. If so, the description I hear from practically everyone who has ever crossed his path will sound unrecognisable.</p> <p>\"I have only nice things to say about him,\" is&#xa0;the preface I hear time and again. Gove is, Chris&#xa0;Huhne says, \"The politest man in the House of Commons. Incredibly well-mannered. Much more so than people who come from grander backgrounds.\" A senior Labour figure tells me, \"The truth is, he doesn't act like a Tory. He is far&#xa0;too decent. He's in politics for all the right reasons.\" The political columnist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/matthew-dancona\" title=\"\">Matthew d'Ancona</a> agrees: \"He is just an incredibly nice guy. A lot of people are very nice&#xa0;guys, 'but' \u2013 and with politicians that can have&#xa0;a very big capital B. But he is an absolutely nice guy. He's not a fair-weather friend at all, he's&#xa0;fundamentally loyal, he is a very empathetic character and very solicitous of people's feelings. I'm yet to come away from a&#xa0;gathering where he&#xa0;hasn't charmed everybody in the room. Michael&#xa0;is&#xa0;a very ironic and incredibly good at taking the piss out of himself; he's one of&#xa0;those people you hope will be at dinner.\"</p> <p>From those who knew Gove as a young child, right through to colleagues today, the unanimity of opinion is almost freakish. George Allan was Gove's headmaster throughout secondary school,&#xa0;\"And when I see Michael on the television now, I&#xa0;can still see the 11-year-old boy. He didn't change&#xa0;his persona throughout his school career. Consistency \u2013 that's the word, consistency. We couldn't claim to be the authors of his remarkable civility. He created his own image.\"</p> <p>If Cameron fails to deliver a second term \u2013 and&#xa0;a&#xa0;clear Tory majority in 2015 is looking like a&#xa0;tall order \u2013 there will almost certainly be a new party leader. With the question of succession becoming a very real issue, the education secretary is a very real contender.</p> <p>In August 1967, a baby called Graham was born in Edinburgh to a young unmarried mother, and became Michael Gove four months later, the adopted son of a couple in&#xa0;Aberdeen. A younger sister was adopted five years later, and the Labour-voting family lived in&#xa0;a small ground-floor flat in a tidy if austere grey&#xa0;terrace, until his father's fish-processing business became successful enough for them to&#xa0;move into a three-bedroom semi.</p> <p>Gove attended his local state primary until the age of 11, when he passed the entrance exam to Aberdeen's most prestigious private school for boys. <a href=\"http://www.rgc.aberdeen.sch.uk/\" title=\"\">Robert Gordon's College</a> dominates the city&#xa0;centre, a relatively short distance from Gove's&#xa0;childhood home but a significant cultural leap. Every day the teenage Gove would set off&#xa0;from his little semi with its neat vertical white&#xa0;blinds and symmetrical hanging baskets, to&#xa0;an imposing&#xa0;granite colossus resembling a Soviet-style Eton. But he made the journey with&#xa0;remarkable ease. He rode an ancient bicycle,&#xa0;carried an umbrella, was fond of wearing&#xa0;suits, and quickly established himself as&#xa0;one of the school's most precocious characters.</p> <p>Mike Duncan taught Gove English and debating, and remembers a star debater and \"endlessly enquiring\" boy who enjoyed testing his teacher by reciting the opening line of a novel&#xa0;and challenging Duncan to name the book. Well&#xa0;read and self-consciously clever, Gove and his friends were big fans of sci-fi role-play games such as Wargame, and another called Nuclear War, which involved building up stocks of weapons and occasionally firing them off. A&#xa0;poem&#xa0;penned in his final year, An Essay On Teaching (With Apologies To Alexander Pope), may or may not make teachers smile today, and satirical entries about the senior boys in 1985 suggest he and his friends were already enthusiastic subscribers to Private Eye.</p> <p>\"Michael Gove: His eventual entrance to Oxfam University has finally confirmed his place among mere immortals. He now earns his money tutoring Mr Duncan in English. Naked without his tweeds, it is Colonel Fogey's ambition to be a&#xa0;listed building when he grows up.\" When Gove&#xa0;was invited back a few years later to take part in a debate, posters depicting a&#xa0;caricature of&#xa0;the Ghostbusters' ghost went up all over the school with the strap line: \"Take Govey down at&#xa0;the debate!\"</p> <p>\"Michael was very much a wit,\" one former classmate remembers, \"and a joy to have around. We were never intimates, but he was friendly, intelligent, a nice bloke. He wasn't cool or fashionable, but he was very popular because he would always have a funny rejoinder, and could outwit the teachers. My childhood memories are peppered with laughter because of Michael. One of the things I valued him for was that he prevented me from being bullied. I had glasses and red hair, and I&#xa0;vividly remember being bullied in the changing room, and Michael tried to stop it.\"</p> <p>Gove arrived at Lady Margaret Hall to study English in 1985. The novelist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/mar/30/philip-hensher-life-in-writing\" title=\"\">Philip Hensher</a> can still recall watching the freshers arrive, and noticing one dressed in a three-piece green tweed&#xa0;suit. \"It was really a young fogey thing. He&#xa0;seemed a little bit older than he was, but not in a ridiculous way. If&#xa0;there was an element of absurdity to him, he always seemed to be in on it,&#xa0;which is a very attractive characteristic.\"</p> <p>Anthony Goodman was president of the&#xa0;Oxford union when Gove arrived. \"He was one of the most gifted speakers I saw in the union. But he didn't generate any antagonism; he was confident, but not in a pushy, aggressive way. He just seemed like an old head on young shoulders.\" Goodman doesn't think Gove was contriving a performance to get in with the elite social set. \"That's pretty much why&#xa0;I did debating,\" he jokes, \"but not Gove. He&#xa0;came across as classless.\"</p> <p>The broadcaster and journalist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/samira-ahmed\" title=\"\">Samira Ahmed</a> edited the union magazine under Gove's presidency, and sums up the consensus: \"I&#xa0;just&#xa0;didn't see why anyone could loathe him,&#xa0;personally. He was a 40-year-old trapped in&#xa0;a&#xa0;20-year-old's body \u2013 but it was totally sincere. There's nothing fake about him at all. He&#xa0;exuded intelligence, and was very grown up for his age. And thinking big political thoughts, on a scale very few of us at that age were thinking. His vision was fully formed at 20.\" Another contemporary, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/toby-young\" title=\"\">Toby Young</a>, agrees. \"He wasn't a&#xa0;work in progress like the rest of us. He seemed to arrive fully formed.\"</p> <p>Gove encountered his first ever setback after graduation, when a job application to the Conservative Research Department was rejected on the grounds that he was \"insufficiently Conservative\". So he returned to Aberdeen and joined the <a href=\"http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Press And Journal</a> as a trainee reporter. Within months, the paper went on strike.</p> <p>The father of chapel, Iain Campbell, recalls the staff's initial unease about Gove. \"We knew he was a Tory, and our concern was&#xa0;to have a united front. So we spoke to Michael, and he was happy to come on board. He&#xa0;wasn't a typical striker by any means, but he&#xa0;was very articulate, so we asked Michael to come&#xa0;to the European parliament in Strasbourg to lobby MEPs. He was a very good colleague. Being on strike can be very mentally straining, so we used to have parties to keep morale up, and he was someone who would always be there, and always very popular.\"</p> <p>Gove has subsequently said he thought the strike achieved little, and for how long he would have stuck it out we'll never know, for within three months he was offered a job in television, and soon moved south to work for the political programme <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/otr/\" title=\"\">On The Record</a>, and then the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/default.stm\" title=\"\">Today programme</a>. In 1992 he was hired by Channel 4 to&#xa0;present a late-night political comedy show, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103555/\" title=\"\">A&#xa0;Stab In The Dark</a>, somewhat to the surprise of&#xa0;his co-presenter, <a href=\"http://www.baddiel.com/\" title=\"\">David Baddiel</a>.</p> <p>\"I thought, I've never seen anyone on late-night alternative TV like this. He&#xa0;was rightwing and looked 53. I think he was wearing a three-piece suit. He wasn't cut from the&#xa0;obvious Tory cloth; he is&#xa0;a&#xa0;very bright bloke and a thinking rightwing person, and I'm always&#xa0;interested in intelligent people who think differently from me. I've had many rows with people I've worked with, but not&#xa0;Michael Gove. He was quite humble. He was&#xa0;always very unaggressive. Not trying all the&#xa0;time to intellectually defeat you in that way&#xa0;that politicians can.\"</p> <p>Around the same time Gove appeared as&#xa0;a&#xa0;chaplain in a feature film set in a&#xa0;boarding school. It was a tiny role, but&#xa0;he'd clearly made a big impression on someone along the way, because the lead schoolboy character was given the name M Gove. Neither the film nor A Stab In the Dark were huge hits, though, and in 1996 Gove joined the Times as a columnist and leader writer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397783251\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349283428073/Michael-Gove-on-an-NUJ-pi-008.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Gove on an NUJ picket line in 1989\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In 1989, while a trainee reporter on Aberdeen's Press And Journal, Gove joined an NUJ picket line. Photograph: Donald Stewart</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Donald Stewart</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Newspaper offices are notoriously fractious places, but staff remember an extravagantly congenial, donnish colleague who would soothe reporters late filing copy with, \"But how <em>are</em> you? Yes, of course, should you so wish to file that would be marvellous, that would be very much appreciated. But it's first important that I&#xa0;know how you <em>are</em>.\" Very much the in-house intellectual, the \"most striking thing about him,\" recalls his former editor, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Stothard\" title=\"\">Peter Stothard</a>, \"was that he could make people on the other side of the argument not only recognise his argument, but also genuinely like him.\"</p> <p>Gove became friends with the rising young Tory stars Cameron, George Osborne and Steve Hilton, and co-founded the centre-right think tank <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Policy Exchange</a>. His influence over the party's modernisation project would be difficult to overstate. The exact nature of his contribution, however, is confusing. Everyone tells me his politics owe everything to his humble origins, and are \"all about creating ladders of opportunity; it's all about things you might call progressive, in terms of goals, but using Conservative means\". He is \"ideologically amphibious\", interested in ideas from the left, \"on a moral mission, to do with helping the poorest\", and responsible for helping to coax his party into the 21st century. Even his political opponents concur. According to a senior Labour party official, \"On sexuality and class and social mobility, on race and gender, he is&#xa0;a genuine liberal.\" He is not, Huhne agrees, \"a&#xa0;traditional rightwinger.\"</p> <p>Then I read every word published under his Times byline up to his election in 2005, and found&#xa0;that Gove the progressive arch-moderniser simply does not fit with the facts. If you want to understand what Tory modernisation really adds up to, it's a highly instructive read.</p> <p>Gove's neo-con hawkishness in foreign policy has always been well known. He called for the invasion of Iraq just two days after 9/11, and before the planes hit the towers he'd already published a column that morning calling for action against Saddam Hussein. A committed Zionist and slavish admirer of George W Bush, a&#xa0;passionate Eurosceptic and staunch defender of&#xa0;British Gibraltar, he regards the Northern Ireland peace process as a shameful capitulation to terrorists, and once wrote a column calling for&#xa0;\"a revival of jingoism\". But where is the evidence in his writing of domestic social liberalism? It doesn't exist.</p> <p>Passionately pro marriage, he opposes statutory paternity pay, stem cell research, euthanasia and contraception for school children, but supports privatisation of both the BBC and the NHS, and proposes the marketisation of immigration policy,&#xa0;whereby a British passport could, he suggests, be sold for \u00a310,000. He is far ruder about the Lib Dems than New Labour, despairs of the \"absurd belief\" that the armed forces ought to reflect the country they serve by recruiting more women and gay men, and takes a&#xa0;robustly bang-em-up approach to law and order. As for supporting public services, Gove can see only one acceptable line: \"The Conservatives could defend public servants from the unjust, unproven and demoralising charge of 'institutional racism',\" the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/feb/24/lawrence.ukcrime12\" title=\"\">Macpherson report</a> being, in his view, an outrage.</p> <p>Why, then, do so many colleagues and political opponents see Gove in this rosier, more moderate light? It has to be because of his debater's gift for according courteous respect to opposing views, creating the impression that he's taken them on board, when he hasn't actually revised his position at all. Everyone tells me how carefully Gove listens, but when asked to recall a single occasion when he has been persuaded to change his mind, to their surprise no one can come up with one. It is a case of manners maketh the impression of a moderniser, for Gove's Tories don't need to be \"inclusive\", or \"tolerant\". The&#xa0;important thing is to look as if they are.</p> <p>He warns the party against \"Social Tone Deafness\", which \"manifests itself in an inability to detect the country's changing mood music\", and calls for candidates who \"look like human beings who understand the daily struggles of modern existence\". But a 2003 column tellingly reveals where Gove ranks the importance of actual policy reform: \"The Tories have not yet adopted a tone, style, culture <em>or even</em> [my italics] a set of policy priorities appropriate for the 21st century.\" A Tory minister and friend of Gove's probably comes closest to the truth when he characterises him as a \"true Conservative, the rightwing conscience of the cabinet. He is a full spectrum, real world Tory; it's all about living in the real world. He would regard the Tory rightwing as completely unrealistic\" \u2013 which is not the&#xa0;same as wrong. Labour MPs like to say Cameron's Conservatives have modernised on only one solitary issue \u2013 homophobia \u2013 and I&#xa0;used to think that had to be&#xa0;too cynical. But in all of Gove's writing it's the only example of an authentically abandoned prejudice.</p> <p>What of Gove's famous passion for social mobility through education? \"His view on social mobility is for people to do what he did \u2013 study classical subjects and go to Oxford,\" argues a Labour critic. \"It's all slightly 'Some working-class people are terribly good at Latin \u2013 give them a chance and you never know!'\" The former Labour schools minister Jim Knight agrees. \"If he thinks social mobility is getting more poor kids into Oxbridge, then I think that's a massively flawed definition. If you are serious about social mobility, it has to be communities and families, not just individuals.\"</p> <p>Interestingly, in 2000 Gove wrote, \"Too many people go to university\", but his columns reveal surprisingly little about the future secretary of state's thoughts on education. For their origins, we need to go back further still, to his old school days. \"He benefited in a life-changing way from a&#xa0;classical liberal education,\" as a close ally puts it, \"and would like that privilege to be extended to people from less privileged backgrounds.\"</p> <p>For all its architectural grandeur, Robert Gordon's College during Gove's era was actually Scotland's second cheapest private day school \u2013 \"more of a glorified grammar, really,\" as a former pupil puts it. About half the boys joined from state primaries, and a quarter received a bursary or scholarship. George Allan and Mike Duncan both assumed Gove had been a scholarship boy, but in fact it was only when his father's business failed in his final year that the family applied for assistance. But every boy had to pass the entrance exam, and the school could operate on the assumption that all pupils would be not merely able, but disposed to work hard.</p> <p>\"When you enter Gordon's and start wearing the blazer and tie, you sort of absorb the traditions of the college,\" a former teacher tells me. \"Those kids from poorer economic backgrounds tried to climb upwards, not pull the others down.\" When&#xa0;I&#xa0;ask Allan what sort of disciplinary problems he used to deal with, he looks surprised. \"Well, if I&#xa0;had one a term, that was enough for me.\" The current acting head says the worst he's encountered was a boy kicking about a plastic bottle who ignored his request to put it in the bin.</p> <p>Gove has always spoken highly of his old school, and when I visit I can see why. But while I'm admiring its orderly classrooms and general air of cheerful application, a teacher puts into words what I find myself thinking. \"The trouble with anyone's own experience of school,\" the teacher points out, \"is that it's so formative that it informs all your ideas about education. That's very natural, but not necessarily a good thing.\"</p> <p>From the age of 11, Gove never shared a desk with anyone who struggled to read and write, or who experienced school as&#xa0;an intimidating trauma instead of a golden ticket. \"His prime concern is to make sure&#xa0;that there are safe schools in cities for people&#xa0;like him,\" says a columnist who has followed his career closely. \"All this nonsense that&#xa0;free schools are free \u2013 they are not, they are Michael Gove schools. He is trying to create a system in which middle-class parents like him can make uses of the state system without having&#xa0;to mix with the rough boys.\"</p> <p>Following his election in 2005, Gove wrote, \"The&#xa0;reason why I'm in Parliament is not really to see my colleagues win power, it is to see us at last in a position where we can give it up.\"</p> <p>But since taking office, he has awarded himself more than 50&#xa0;new powers, including rules allowing him to acquire land from local authorities and private companies to help him increase the number of academies and free schools. This autumn 55 new free schools will open, taking the total to 80, and the number of academies has risen tenfold to more than 2,300, each one accountable not to local authorities, but to the secretary of state himself. \"He is a High Tory control freak who wants to run every school in the country,\" counters the critic of Gove's \"free\" school rhetoric. \"He hasn't got a localist bone in his body.\"</p> <p>There are other curious paradoxes. A friend for more than 20 years has never once heard him mention money, and says he regards it with unworldly indifference. But in 2002 Gove wrote about living perennially beyond his means \u2013 \"Ever since going up to university, I&#xa0;have accumulated new debt, and new means of becoming indebted\". And when the expenses scandal broke, it emerged that he'd spent \u00a37,000 of taxpayers' money on designer furniture, much of it from Cameron's mother-in-law's interior design company.</p> <p>Another puzzle was his use of private email addresses to communicate with his team. Everyone says Gove has a practically courtly deference to protocol, but he was plainly breaking the rules. Gove pleaded an innocent failure to master his own departmental technology, and his physical ineptitude is legendary; being driven by Gove is, apparently, a \"terrifying\" experience. Whether techno-klutziness explains an arrangement that conveniently kept secrets from hostile civil servants, however, is unclear.</p> <p>For a man known to be meticulously conscientious, Gove's ministerial career got off to an oddly bumpy start. In the early months, he drew criticism for awarding a grant to a Jewish schools security trust on whose advisory body he had sat [see footnote], and then there was the botched cancellation of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Schools_for_the_Future\" title=\"\">Building Schools For The Future</a> programme, and confusion over the number of schools wishing to become academies. Gove blamed sabotage by his own department \u2013 in a colleague's words, a \"ministerial blooding\". But last year he hired a special adviser who'd been previously blackballed by Andy Coulson, called Dominic Cummings. \"And you could almost feel,\" says a senior aide, \"that the moment Dom came to join him, things started getting back on track.\"</p> <p>Earlier this year, Gove leaked to the Daily Mail his plan to restore O-Levels, sidestepping departmental and Lib Dem opposition to court the rightwing press, whose praise was predictably rapturous. Issuing every school in the country with a leather-bound King James bible inscribed with the words, \"Presented by the secretary of state for education\" surely did more for Gove's profile than&#xa0;for the nation's spiritual improvement. At \u00a3370,000, it was a pricey gesture, but private donors comprised almost exclusively of rightwing Christian financiers were happy to foot the whole bill. Gove's other big idea this year was pricier still \u2013 a new \u00a360m royal yacht for the Queen as a diamond jubilee present. It was clearly never going to happen, but sent another signal to the right, as did his audacious hymn at the Leveson enquiry to the virtues of \"one of the most impressive and significant figures of the last 50 years\", Rupert Murdoch. \"Cummings is a really amazingly effective political street fighter,\" the aide says, \"the wily operator he needed. Since then, Michael has felt a new sense of confidence.\"</p> <p>Gove's confidence extends well beyond his existing role. Most cabinet ministers haven't the energy or political courage to discuss their colleagues' policies in any detail; Gove isn't one of them. \"Michael does have an opinion on everything,\" says <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/timmontgomerie\" title=\"\">Tim Montgomerie</a>, editor of <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/\" title=\"\">Conservative Home</a>, \"and he talks in cabinet a lot.\" One cabinet minister describes him as \"being slightly inclined to go off on a bit of a rant off his own brief\", and an aide describes his role as the \"energetic challenger \u2013 especially of the system, and of conventional wisdom\". And yet, says another minister firmly, \"I can't think of anyone who sees him as a political rival.\"</p> <p>How could Gove possibly not be seen as a political rival? He may be Osborne's closest ally, but in the opinion of one Lib Dem minister is \"substantially cleverer\". He is Cameron's \"closest&#xa0;friend in politics\", helping him prepare for PMQs, feeding jokes into his speeches, and he&#xa0;\"can be quite dazzlingly funny, brilliant at doing impressions\", a friend reports. \"I've heard him do what must be a set piece, in which he does a great impression of Huhne condescending to Clegg in cabinet, that had the whole table in stitches. Genuinely funny satire.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397783252\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349282180167/Michael-Gove-on-a-New-Yea-008.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Gove on a New Year's Day walk in 2011 with the Cameron family and friends \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On a New Year's Day walk in 2011 with the Cameron family and friends, including Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter.

They&#xa0;are in and out of each other's houses, kids and nannies everywhere, they are each others' kids' godparents, their kids go to the same schools. The question of succession doesn't cross their minds.\"</p> <p>The question is whether it crosses Gove's.</p> <p>Just how far does Gove's ambition go? \"At&#xa0;Oxford it was obvious that some people were warming up for the Commons,\" Samira Ahmed recalls. \"With&#xa0;Boris Johnson, his plan was obvious. But I&#xa0;never heard that said about Michael.\" Former colleagues at the Times assumed for a&#xa0;while that he would become their editor, \"But he wasn't seen as someone angling for his own personal promotion at all.\" Gove has always insisted he has no interest in leading his party, saying, \"I&#xa0;don't have it in me. I don't have what it takes.\" And yet, as Matthew d'Ancona observes, \"You can&#xa0;never assume that a politician who has devoted his life to the game will walk away from the chance to be leader or PM. It's ridiculous for us to think that any politician might.\"</p> <p>A lot of very wealthy Tories presumably agree, for Gove's constituency office last year received five times the party's national average sum of donations. Individual and corporate donors gave&#xa0;Gove, who occupies one of the safest seats in the country, more than \u00a360,000 \u2013 almost twice the sum received by Osborne's office and three times more than Cameron's. What exactly are they funding?</p> <p>Nobody believes Gove would ever challenge Cameron for the leadership. And Gove had always&#xa0;assumed that, when the succession did come, the heir would be Osborne. But now that&#xa0;the chancellor is becoming unelectably damaged goods, and talk of a Johnson leadership bid gathers momentum, few think Gove would simply stand by and watch London's mayor move&#xa0;into Downing Street. If the party needs a&#xa0;Stop Boris candidate, it will be Gove.</p> <p>Does he have what it takes? Former colleagues are unsure. \"He is an intellectual, not a man of&#xa0;the&#xa0;people, and whether he could operate in&#xa0;an&#xa0;environment in which not very many people knew who <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiro_Agnew\" title=\"\">Spiro Agnew</a> was I don't know.\"&#xa0;I ask his old boss, and Stothard chuckles. \"I think by common consent the job of home news editor wasn't his natural home. News editors, unless they're hated half the time, are not&#xa0;really on top of their job. Was Michael able to&#xa0;do the throwing the typewriter thing? No. He&#xa0;didn't have the temperament for that role. I&#xa0;don't really believe in pop psychology, so I'm reluctant to go into this very far, but he is quite thin-skinned. Perhaps too sensitive to be home news editor \u2013 or prime minister.\"</p> <p>Someone else who knows Gove well agrees that at first he tended to flap when things didn't&#xa0;go smoothly. \"This 'I haven't got what it takes' line, I think what he was referring to was this thing of coping with the ups and downs and the crap you get. The relentless roller-coaster and inevitable failures. He previously might have been a bit insecure about his ability to cope&#xa0;with adversity, but I think that has gone now. I think that has changed. If you'd asked me&#xa0;18 months ago, do you think he could and should aim to be PM one day, I would have said&#xa0;no. But now I think Michael could.\" There's&#xa0;some speculation that the decision will ultimately fall to his wife, the Times columnist <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/tag/sarah-vine\" title=\"\">Sarah Vine</a>, but no agreement on which way she'll go.</p> <p>\"I think she adores being a Tory wife,\" says one friend. \"The more pictures she can be in with Sam Cam, the better her life becomes.\" But another disagrees. \"I've heard people say that, but I don't think she's a scheming Machiavellian political wife, pushing her husband's career.\" She has a funny way of going about it if she is, featuring marital anecdotes in her column that render him a faintly absurd eccentric.</p> <p>The couple met at the Times, married in 2001, and live with their daughter and son, nine and seven, in a modest terraced house at the Wormwood Scrubs end of North Kensington, where dinner is \"a standard middle-class set up; completely informal, non matching furniture, child-centred, you can't move for books, the kids are usually up. Sarah does most of the cooking \u2013 meat and two veg or pasta, no bought in food or waitresses or any of that nonsense \u2013 and Michael's pouring the wine. It's jolly and cosy and warm and about having fun.\"</p> <p>And if Vine's wider family wind up as Downing Street in-laws, then by all accounts they should provide fabulous entertainment. \"A totally mad, bonkers, crazy family,\" a friend laughs. \"They're around in&#xa0;Michael's life in a soap opera sort of way, fodder for amazing stories and anecdotes and hassle and problems.\"</p> <p>Gove's relationship with his parents has always&#xa0;been \"very tender and loving\", another friend says. \"That said, I don't want to sound crude or pompous, but he has a metropolitan London life. There is a gap there.\"</p> <p>But Gove has never looked for his birth mother, and says he never will, out of loyalty to the parents who raised him. \"He is just not a very conflicted person,\" another friend offers simply. \"I don't think there's a great deal of inner turmoil there. He regards life as having smiled on him.\"</p> <p>Gove has always been good-humoured about his place in the party's popularity stakes. In fact, he's so accustomed to coming second as the party faithful's choice of after-dinner speaker, he likes to joke that on his gravestone will be carved the words: \"They Couldn't Get Boris.\" But though Johnson's sense of humour has got him a long way so far, few would bet on him having the last laugh. \"If you had told me Boris Johnson was going to be mayor of London,\" reflects Anthony Goodman, their fellow ex-Oxford union president, \"I definitely would have laughed at you. If you had told me Michael Gove was going to be in government, I would have thought that was pretty obvious.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This footnote was added on 15 October 2012.

  "<p>There are thousands of unpublished authors out there wanting to become published ones \u2013 many of them writing&#xa0;with a children's readership in&#xa0;mind. You only have to spend a few&#xa0;minutes on Facebook or Twitter or&#xa0;browsing the various blogs and websites to see the networks and communities that have sprung up globally for such writers to support and&#xa0;encourage one another, sharing tips and information.</p> <p>Inevitably, the self-appointed label of \"unpublished author\" covers the whole range of people, from those who like the idea of being an author but have never knuckled down to the actual writing part, to some very accomplished writers who just need that lucky break.</p> <p>SCBWI \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.scbwi.org/\" title=\"\">Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators</a> \u2013 does much to support and encourage unpublished writers. In the UK, its annual Undiscovered Voices competition culminates in the publication of an anthology of excerpts from the best of&#xa0;the unpublished children's fiction novels, submitted by&#xa0;its members. This&#xa0;is then sent to children's book agents and editors in the hope that these undiscovered voices will not remain undiscovered for long.</p> <p>One such find was Paula Rawsthorne's <em>The Truth About Celia Frost</em>. Although Rawsthorne, a former teacher and social worker, is not new to published short-story writing, this is&#xa0;her first novel.</p> <p>At first, it appears that Celia Frost \u2013&#xa0;a&#xa0;14-year-old red-headed schoolgirl \u2013 is suffering from haemophilia, or some such disorder, where a simple cut could cause her to bleed to death because her blood won't clot. Then there is the growing possibility that, in truth, there's nothing wrong with Celia at all: that her mother, Janice, is suffering from the likes of Munchausen by proxy, lying to Celia and feigning her illness \u2026 but the truth? The truth is far more sinister.</p> <p>Despite Rawsthorne's social-work background, <em>The Truth About Celia Frost</em> is more of a fast-paced chase thriller than a slice of social realism. Part of its appeal is that it's straightforward and uncomplicated, and the ducking and diving is so localised. Much of the story takes place in and around a housing estate, or in a water-filled, disused quarry.</p> <p>The very fact that the story remains within this microcosm, rather than breaking out into, say, an <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/books/video/2012/mar/28/anthony-horowitz-alex-rider-villains-video\" title=\"\">Alex Rider</a> style adventure, or the fugitive-in-hiding feeling of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/mar/10/featuresreviews.guardianreview16\" title=\"\">Kevin Brooks's <em>Being</em></a>, is a part of what makes <em>Celia Frost</em> different. And, like the main protagonist in <em>Being</em>, the truth about Celia Frost, the character, makes her very different from the rest of us too.</p> <p>Although none of the characters is&#xa0;multidimensional \u2013 this isn't an angst-ridden young-adult tale, but is for younger readers \u2013 Rawsthorne is adept at making the reader regularly change their attitude towards them.</p> <p>In addition to Janice, who hits the bottle when things get really bad, there's Frankie, the ex-policeman turned private investigator, whose attitude to the law seems particularly pertinent in the current phone-hacking climate. Running the FBI (Frankie Byrne Investigations, a one-man outfit), he has a plethora of fake IDs, and very adaptable \"morals\". The real&#xa0;villain of the piece, though, is his&#xa0;client.</p> <p><em>The Truth About Celia Frost</em> is not&#xa0;without its faults, but it's fast and&#xa0;fun, and difficult to pigeon-hole, which is no bad thing in this age of rigid genres. What's more, I found myself caring about the central characters and \u2013 despite the relevance of blood in the story \u2013 I'm delighted to report that this book is guaranteed vampire-free.</p> <p>\u2022 Philip Ardagh's omnibus edition of <em>The Eddie Dickens Trilogy</em> is published by Faber.</p>",
  "<p>Few people fit the series title of these interviews as comprehensively as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/andrew-motion\" title=\"\">Andrew Motion</a>. His life in writing takes in poetry (from winning the Newdigate prize when a student at Oxford to becoming poet laureate) and five varied novels that have included bildungsromans, experimental meshings of fact and fiction, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780224091190/silver-return-to-treasure-island\" title=\"\">a sequel to <em>Treasure Island</em></a>. He has been a book publisher, a magazine editor and an anthologist. He has written critical studies, biographies (the Lambert family, Keats, Larkin) and memoirs. He is a reviewer, a committee man who chaired the 2010 Man Booker prize, and his debut play about the Afghan war was staged last year. As a teacher he succeeded Malcolm Bradbury on the creative writing course at the University of East Anglia and he was also the poetry master in Jamie Oliver's television Dream School.</p> <p>\"It might be unnecessary to say it, but I never wanted to be someone who only did poetry,\" he explains. \"That is partly because I was able to do other things, but is also something to do with thinking that the poems themselves will benefit from contact with other types of life. Throughout it all poetry has always been the thing. As far as I'm concerned it is the senior service. It's the most difficult thing to do well and it's where I came in and I suspect it's where I'll go out. If I were to lie on my deathbed having written half a dozen decent poems that I thought people might read after my death, then I would think that I hadn't lived in vain.\"</p> <p>This month Motion celebrates both his 60th birthday and the publication of <em>The Custom House</em> (Faber), his first collection of poetry written entirely since he stopped being poet laureate in 2009. Towards the end of his laureateship he endured a writers' block that was broken for a single week when he wrote a poem for Harry Patch, one of the last survivors of the first world war, and some elegies for his father, who had died in 2006. \"But then, pretty much on the day that I stopped laureateing, like someone at Heathrow asked to signal the planes in, there they all were, lined up to land.\"</p> <p>He began to notice that many of these new poems were about men \u2013 like his father who saw action on D-Day \u2013 involved in 20th-century western wars. \"I had written these poems about my dad very quickly, and then the poems had dried up or gone underground. But when they came up again, they turned out still to be about him. But they also felt like a new start. I'm sure it was partly because so much else changed in my life about the same time: getting married again\" \u2013 his third wife is the Korean translator Kyeong-Soo Kim \u2013 \"my father's death, not laureating, moving house and writing <em>Silver</em>\" \u2013 his sequel to <em>Treasure Island</em> \u2013 \"which was a kind of adventure.\"</p> <p>But while much has changed in Motion's life, his poetic preoccupations have remained constant. \"There is a lot in common in terms of the obsessions I have always worried away at and probably will always worry away at to my dying day. But what poet doesn't? In fact I am almost inclined to say that if you don't have that degree of obsession as a writer, then there's a problem. Of course, if your obsession is with tomatoes, that's not such good news. The number of good things you can write about a tomato is probably limited. But if your obsession is with death and the preservation of memories, that is quite a big subject, and I don't see why it shouldn't keep me busy until my own occurs.\"</p> <p>One of his most constant subjects has been that of his mother, Gillian Motion, who had a riding accident when he was 17 and was in a coma for nearly 10 years until her death in 1978. She is represented in the new collection in a poem featuring the young Andrew sitting on their Aga \u2013 \"where I spent most of my early life. God knows what my insides must be like\" \u2013 talking to her in their kitchen.</p> <p>\"If a tragedy occurs to a person early in their life it can, sometimes in good ways and sometimes in damaging ways, tie them to that moment in their lives for ever. I think that happened to me. I left home early, had an independent life and I try to do things in the world. I haven't wanted to be defeated by it. But I felt it was the absolutely central thing in my emotional make-up. And then \u2013 which I hadn't expected to happen \u2013 the very day my father died, 40-odd years later, I felt my mother depart from me and her presence in me changed. She didn't disappear. But she stopped being the default setting in everything I thought about. Will I keep writing about her? We'll see. There's no burning desire at the moment. I used to feel that people couldn't hurt me because I'd already been hurt so badly. It was a kind of shield as well as a sadness. The ending of that feeling has been important. It has made me more self-confident and probably more open. This feeling of liberation I have is crucially to do with that. The clich\u00e9 hovering around this is that people don't really grow up until their parents are dead. But there is a special sense in which that is definitely true for me.\"</p> <p>Motion was born in 1952 and brought up in rural Essex. His father was a brewer, and Motion spent most of his childhood thinking he might work for the Forestry Commission or become a priest. No one in his family had been to university before him and his father claimed to have read \"half a book in his life: <em>The Lonely Skier</em> by Hammond Innes\".</p> <p>Like so many writers, Motion had an inspirational English teacher: Peter&#xa0;Way at Radley School, to whom Motion dedicates a poem in the new collection. \"It is no exaggeration to say he gave me my life. It wasn't him just saying 'bored with your life? Come here to the sunny&#xa0;uplands of poetry.' He told me that the writers he was going to introduce me to \u2013 Edward Thomas, Wordsworth, Larkin \u2013 would help me understand my own early life, particularly in terms of landscape. I've lived in London for over 30 years yet nearly all my poems are set in a landscape, not a townscape. He gave me a new world and also a bridge so that I could import the things that I valued from my old world.\"</p> <p>Motion says he was never attracted to the boozy coterie side of poetic life \u2013 \"although I did have lunch with Ian Hamilton in a pub. And yes, he did stub out his cigarette in the food\" \u2013 claiming he always had a sense that he has to get up in the morning to do the next thing. But he has a few close writer friends, most notably Alan Hollinghurst, who won the Newdigate prize the year before Motion did. \"What has been incalculably important is that every time I put a manuscript together, he is the first person who sees it. I do the same with his stuff. I believe 99% of what he tells me and make changes accordingly. I was born slightly too early to go to a creative writing course, but it feels as if I've always been in a two-man creative writing workshop.\"</p> <p>After Oxford Motion taught at Hull, where he published his early poetry and met Larkin. He would later become his literary executor and biographer. They first met in the university staff bar. Larkin took a \"huge slug\" of beer, which went down the wrong way, and had a coughing fit. \"So instead of kneeling at his feet and saying how much I admired his poetry,\" Motion recalls, \"I was banging his back and his glasses fell off, and the whole thing was all rather more intimate than I expected.\" Motion remembers a \"slight incredulity at the back of my mind\" that Larkin was so nice to him, as his reputation \"even then, when people hadn't read the letters, was of a tremendously curmudgeonly person. But we started off well when I told him my father was a brewer. He decided that I'd come from 'stock' that produced things that people actually needed: booze, as opposed to what they could take or leave: art.\"</p> <p>Motion published his Whitbread <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/literary-criticism/9780571170654/philip-larkin-a-writers-life\" title=\"\">prize-winning biography of Larkin</a> in 1993, by which time his fellow executor Anthony Thwaite's collected letters had already aired many of the revelations about Larkin's apparent racism and misogyny. But the biography still brought renewed criticism of Larkin and, from some, criticism of Motion for using material Larkin might have assumed would be destroyed after his death.</p> <p>\"I still feel the decisions Anthony Thwaite and I took as trustees to get all this stuff out there was absolutely the right one. Partly because things have a habit of coming out anyway in a mangled form if you sit on them. But the more dignified point is that whatever happens in a writer's life is not necessarily an adequate account of what happens in their work. In fact, almost always not. And where it might affect the poems \u2013 and there are a few where you can see the private opinions creeping over \u2013 wouldn't it be better to have an adult conversation in full knowledge of the facts and then either get over it or not?\"</p> <p>By the time of the Larkin biography, Motion had left Hull, been editor of Poetry Review magazine and editorial director of Chatto, had published an influential anthology of contemporary British poetry, written the first two parts of a proposed \u2013 and then abandoned \u2013 roman-fleuve novel cycle, as well as continuing to teach and serve as an arts committee stalwart. And all the while writing poetry.</p> <p>\"The whole thing has been a struggle to find a way to satisfy a commitment to the world, my pleasure in teaching\" \u2013 he is currently at Royal Holloway \u2013 \"and to allow for the writing life. The balance was thrown off by the nine-to-five aspects at Hull, so I went to work part-time at Chatto, which was good for a while. Then I became editorial director and the balance got out of kilter again so I gave up Chatto. That's how it's been ever since. At the moment, if I can keep the committee stuff under control\" \u2013 he has recently been elected president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England \u2013 \"things are fine.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/poetry/9780140585520/penguin-book-of-contemporary-british-poetry\" title=\"\">1982 Penguin anthology that he edited with Blake Morrison</a> gave Motion his first experience of shaping, or at least mapping, the contemporary poetry world. \"It caused a hoo-ha, but what is the point of doing an anthology if it doesn't cause a hoo-ha? Did we make the right calls? Well, almost none of the poets in that book have disappeared. But it's possible that that was the last time you could get away with doing an anthology of that kind. The idea of the poetic centre was beginning to disintegrate, but it was more intact than it is now. Now everything has flown apart and there are tremendous things to be said for that. But the risk is that everything will become fractured and parti pris and the consequences for educators and people being educated are quite complicated.\"</p> <p>The anthology established Motion as a prominent literary figure, and by the time of his friend Ted Hughes's death in 1998 he was the leading candidate to take over as poet laureate and made no secret of the fact that he would accept if offered. \"I did think what it would be like to be translated from a more or less private person to a public one. And my judgment fell way short of reality. I also thought about what it would be like to respond to commissions. It is a fiendishly difficult job, and what Betjeman and Ted said in their letters is pretty much what I'd say now, and we'll see what Carol Ann says in the fullness of time. Any well-functioning creative mind needs to make a negotiation between the bit of itself that knows what it is doing and the bit that doesn't know what it is doing. If you are endlessly writing about ideas that other people are giving you \u2013 commissions \u2013 then the bit of your mind that knows what it is doing is going to be overexposed. You end up writing poems that prioritise the idea of subject. But the best poems aren't always written by going in through the front door of the subject. You're probably better going through the side, or the back door, or the chimney. To have that freedom back again is wonderful.\"</p> <p>He acknowledges that some of his laureate poems worked better than others. \"But the one that everyone really didn't like\" \u2013 about Prince William's 18th birthday \u2013 \"was meant to be a joke. I was routinely surrounded by people who were being silly about serious poems, and then they got serious about a silly one. All that was very tiresome to deal with. But I think the two I wrote for the Queen Mum and the one I wrote for Charles getting married to Camilla are quite good. There were only eight, so to like three isn't too bad.\"</p> <p>While he says the laureate years already feel distant and that he doesn't want to be defined by them, he remains proud of changing the job from that of a potentially anachronistic courtier to being a champion of poetry. \"The more important opportunity was not writing poems that may or may not please people. It was what you can do for poetry. All that flag-waving, drum-banging and bunting-arranging can be incredibly important. The proof of how important is the <a href=\"http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/home.do\" title=\"\">Poetry Archive</a>.\"</p> <p>Set up by Motion and the recording producer Richard Carrington in 1999, just after Motion had been appointed laureate, the Poetry Archive has become a vast, ever-expanding online collection of recordings of poets reading their own work. \"If I hadn't been laureate we would never have raised the two million quid we needed to get it off the ground. Now the archive is used by a quarter of a million people every month and is profoundly changing the way poetry is taught in schools. For a time I was forever meeting people saying that they didn't think the post should exist any more. You now never meet people who say that. So am I glad that I did the job? Absolutely. Am I glad that I gave it up? Absolutely. For my own work I had to relax more and feel out of the limelight. I had to feel un-coerced. And I immediately did as soon as I stopped.\"</p> <p>He says that even <em>Silver</em>, on the face of it something of a departure, is of a piece with what he has done before. \"You know how you don't see things under your nose? All the time I was writing it I felt very at home, but it took a clever friend of mine to point out that it is all about resurrection. And I suppose that's right. It's clearly to do with the issuing of preservation orders of one kind or another, which, as I know, is what I do in my poems.\" He is currently at work on a second instalment set in America in 1800; a third and final volume is planned with Jim back in England. \"<em>Silver</em> was an adventure story, the next book will be a sort of a western and the last one a thriller. I loved writing the first one and am enjoying the second. I feel more energised and am writing more than I have at any time in my life. And it hasn't really dried up since the laureateship, which is all rather good news as I'm about to turn 60. Maybe I'm like an oak tree putting out lots of acorns because it knows it hasn't got that much longer to live. But it feels as if I've been revitalised, and looking ahead I seem to have enough work planned to keep me going until my 70th birthday.\"</p>",
  "<p>No writer is better placed than Chinua Achebe to tell the story of the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/596712.stm\" title=\"\">Nigerian Biafran war </a>from a cultural and political perspective. Yet, apart from an interview with Transition magazine in 1968 and a book of Biafran poems, Nigeria's most eminent novelist has kept a literary silence about the civil war in which he played a prominent role \u2013 until now. In his engrossing new memoir, <em>There Was A Country</em>, Achebe, now 81, finally speaks about his life during the conflict that nearly tore Nigeria apart in the late 60s.</p> <p>In many ways, the early part of Achebe's life mirrors the story of early Nigeria. Nicknamed \"Dictionary\", Achebe was a gifted Igbo student and enthusiastic reader, a member of the \"Lucky Generation\" of young students who rubbed shoulders at top institutions under the tutelage of Oxbridge colonials. They were effortlessly absorbed into the media, industry and civil service, serving a Nigeria driven by optimism on its way to freedom from British rule.</p> <p>By independence in 1960, Igbo people dominated commerce and the public sector in a land where the three biggest ethnic groups (the Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo) were jostling for supremacy. Achebe attributes Igbo domination to their self-confidence, inherent democratic values and adaptability, which were suited to Nigeria's modernising economy. But many Nigerians resented it, and Achebe admits that the Igbo could be cocky, brash and materialistic, though he rejects the popular suspicion that there was a pan-Igbo agenda to control Nigeria \u2013 his people have too strong an \"individualistic ethic\".</p> <p>Six years after independence, corruption and electoral rigging preceded a military coup that overthrew Nigeria's first prime minister, the Muslim northerner, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abubakar_Tafawa_Balewa\" title=\"\">Abubakar Tafawa Balewa</a>. Although most of the coup-plotters were Igbo, Achebe disputes that it was an \"Igbo\" coup, partly on the basis that its leader,<a href=\"http://www.dawodu.com/nzeogwu2.htm\" title=\"\"> Major Nzeogwu</a>, had grown up in the north and was Igbo in name only. Nevertheless, the murder of Nigeria's northern leaders led to pogroms in which 30,000 Igbos living in the north were killed. The bloodshed culminated in<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/27/chukwuemeka-odumegwu-ojukwu\" title=\"\"> General Emeka Ojukwu</a>'s declaration in 1967 that the Igbos' south-eastern region would secede from a country in which his people \"felt unwanted\".</p> <p>Fearing the disintegration of Nigeria, the government blocked the secession with military force, backed by a UK government keen to protect its oil interests. Profoundly disappointed by this turn of events, Achebe left his job at the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation in Lagos and returned with his family to the south-east, now calling itself the Republic of Biafra. The Nigerian army launched a three-pronged attack to subdue the Biafrans, who fought back assiduously despite being out-resourced. Achebe describes a wartime spirit that inspired Biafran engineers to build army tanks out of reinforced Range Rovers and to invent the infamous <a href=\"http://www.nairaland.com/618174/wonders-biafran-war-tech-ogbunigwe\" title=\"\"><em>ogbunigwe</em></a> (bucket bomb) with devastating effect. Though he abhors violence, Achebe cites these as evidence of the quality of the Nigerian people, and he laments the corruption that strangled such ingenuity.</p> <p>In the middle chapters, memoir gives way to largely neutral historical analysis, with Achebe citing a range of voices, media reports and books. There are interesting insights into the war's two central players: Biafra's leader Ojukwu and Nigerian president, <a href=\"http://www.onlinenigeria.com/gowon.asp\" title=\"\">General Yakubu Gowon</a>, both Sandhurst-trained young men. Rivalries between them and within their teams \"confounded political science models\". Possessing little administrative experience, the two men pursued ego-driven policies, and missed opportunities to end the conflict sooner. Achebe cites Biafran diplomat Raph Uwechue, who accused Ojukwu of choosing ideology over pragmatism when he rejected relief supplies from the British.</p> <p>In the following chapters, Achebe's personal story re-emerges. Despite the war, he lived a remarkably productive life. Driven by his belief in the political obligations of the writer, he became Biafra's international envoy, promoting the cause in Canada, Europe and Senegal. He set up a publishing company with his close friend Chris Okigbo, and became Biafra's communications minister, writing a manifesto for the republic. He describes being part of an intellectual elite that came together to recreate a Biafran microcosm of Nigeria's early spirit, their ideals drawn from a mix of traditional Igbo philosophy, US-style liberalism and socialism.</p> <p>As the federal army closed in, Achebe and his family moved from town to town before settling in his father's village. The atrocities proved inescapable: at a market, Achebe's wife Christie saw a bomb split a pregnant woman in two. Achebe relays such horrors \u2013 including the deaths of his mother and friend Okigbo \u2013 with stoic brevity; his strongest expressions of sorrow are his poems, such as the famous <a href=\"http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~lavie/dreamwine/achebe1.html\" title=\"\">\"Refugee Mother and Child\"</a>. Reproduced from his 1971 Biafran poetry book <em>Beware, Soul Brother</em>, these verses are scattered between chapters, offering affecting interludes.</p> <p>As the conflict dragged on, Biafra buckled under a blockade so brutal it provoked an international outcry: mass starvation, kwashiorkor and mental illness devastated the Igbo landscape, where vultures, those \"avian prognosticators of death\", circled overhead. Biafra was the world's first properly televised conflict, and millions across the world were appalled by the horrors flickering on their screens. Such people as Joan Baez, John Lennon, Martin Luther King and Karl Vonnegut galvanised international responses to the tragedy, in an age before \"Africa fatigue\" had set in.</p> <p>By the time hostilities ended in 1970, three million Biafrans had died, in contrast to 100,000 casualties on the federal side. Igbos weren't mere casualties of war, Achebe insists, but victims of calculated genocide. Ojukwu, meanwhile, escaped to live in exile in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, inviting accusations of cowardice. Achebe rationalises this move on the basis that if the Biafran leader had stayed in Nigeria, Gowon would have been less magnanimous and conciliatory towards Igbos after the war.</p> <p>Igbos were reintegrated into Nigerian society, but still faced economic discrimination. Achebe offers an excerpt of an interview in which Gowon tries to justify the crippling \u00a320 flat fee given to every Biafran wanting to convert their Biafran currency back to the Nigerian naira. This sense of persecution still persists today: Achebe believes that Igbo people are the engine of Nigeria's advancement, stifled by a corrupt elite that prefers power and mediocrity to meritocracy. Igbo ostracisation, he says, is \"one of the main reasons for the country's continued backwardness\". Some might call this supremacism, but Achebe is ultimately a Nigerian patriot who sympathises with ordinary Igbos, rather than any broad Igbo power structure.</p> <p>The final chapter is an exhortation to better governance, in which he examines corruption, ethnic bigotry, state failure and the steps Nigeria must take to rehabilitate itself. This prescriptive wish list reminds us of the gap between theory and practice in Nigerian politics; it makes you pine for the likes of Achebe to govern.

  "<p>On the afternoon of Thursday 16 October 1834, John Snell, an ironmonger from Devon, was enjoying the sights of London. He and the friend with whom he was staying took a tour of the Houses of Parliament, guided by the deputy housekeeper Mrs Wright. Snell had never seen the House of Lords before but, as he later explained to a government inquiry, he thought it \"a strange thing that there should be so much heat and smoke in it\". Wright, whose complacency on that day was the cause of much later comment, assured them there was nothing to worry about.</p> <p>Three hours later the Lords was unmistakably on fire. At 6.30pm a great mass of flame exploded out of the side of the building towards <a href=\"http://www.westminster-abbey.org/\" title=\"\">Westminster Abbey</a> and another from the roof. For the rest of that brightly moonlit night a vast crowd watched the last great show of Georgian London. A sublime pyrotechnic display, it destroyed <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/estatehistory/the-middle-ages/\" title=\"\">the medieval Palace of Westminster</a>, home to Parliament for eight centuries, and marked the end of an age. Spectators, including Turner, busily sketching, packed the river so tight with boats that it was possible to walk from one bank to the other. At Windsor William IV and Queen Adelaide saw the blaze on the horizon.</p> <p>Tracing the events of that night hour by hour, Caroline Shenton's book recreates the suspense and drama so well that it is easy to forget that we know what happened in the end. The desperate and ultimately successful attempt to save Westminster Hall, the largest <a href=\"http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/styles/medieval/roofs-and-vaults/timber-roofs/hammerbeam-roofs.html\" title=\"\">hammerbeam roof</a> in Europe, is fought out inch by inch, as is the chaos of the first efforts to quell the fire. Among the many strange sights that evening were parliamentary records being flung from windows, while the antiquary Thomas Phillipps ran about picking them up from the cobbles. Chance, the famous fire brigade dog went bounding through the m\u00eal\u00e9e, while on the Abbey roof another antiquary, Francis Palgrave, tried in vain to persuade the Dean to move the Domesday Book further from the advancing flames.</p> <p>The vividness of Shenton's description comes from the wealth of first-hand testimony she has accumulated. As well as the government enquiry, she quotes from press reports and private letters, telling the story in many voices. We hear from the famous, including Cobbett, Carlyle and Pugin, the unjustly forgotten, notably James Braidwood, superintendent of the London Fire Engine Establishment, whose expertise and bravery were largely responsible for controlling the fire, and many like Snell who remain otherwise unknown. Frances Rickman, daughter of a clerk assistant to the Commons, whose family lived at the Palace, sat down at 3.30am to write a breathless account of events, reassuring relatives in the country that she was safe, though the fire was not out and her room was lit by the \"still blazing House of Commons\".</p> <p>Nobody doubted that the conflagration marked a turning point. The early 1830s had seen widespread civil unrest and agitation for reform. Cobbett was not alone in seeing in the smoking ruins \"a well-merited visitation\" on a corrupt regime. Yet as Shenton emphasises, the Whig government then in power had brought in many of the overdue reforms. It had extended the franchise, passed the Factory Acts \u2013 indeed in closing one old nest of sinecures, the Exchequer of Receipt, it had, indirectly caused the fire. The wooden tally sticks that had been used as receipts were now redundant and it was the burning of them that had melted the copper flues under the Lords' Chamber and started the blaze.</p> <p>In one sense the cause hardly mattered. The palace, adapted, extended and infilled over centuries had been, since the Reform Act, crowded to bursting point. Six hundred and fifty-eight MPs were packed like \"herrings in a barrel\". Space was at such a premium in the Commons that members had been known to vote with the opposition rather than give up their place. That the building was a tinder box had often been pointed out and the problem of how or whether to rebuild it had been much debated. That question at least was settled by the fire. Yet the loss to history and architecture was immense. The painted chamber, one of the wonders of medieval Europe, was destroyed, as was<a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?q=st+stephen%27s+chapel&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;sa=X&amp;rls=en&amp;biw=1304&amp;bih=1047&amp;tbm=isch&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbnid=zmAEG_6HIKcVWM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/estatehistory/reformation-1834/commons-chamber17th-18thc-/&amp;docid=l2YWJgr5789ldM&amp;imgurl=http://assets3.parliament.uk/iv/main-large//ImageVault/Images/id_224/scope_0/ImageVaultHandler.aspx.jpg&amp;w=460&amp;h=230&amp;ei=325pUICREcXV0QXMtoCwBg&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=634&amp;sig=101825355050522240459&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=113&amp;tbnw=225&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=25&amp;ved=1t:429,r:5,s:0,i:87&amp;tx=105&amp;ty=65\" title=\"\"> St Stephen's Chapel</a>, where Parliament had sat since the Reformation, along with innumerable historic records.</p> <p>Not everyone was sorry. The king seemed \"not much affected\" as he and Adelaide inspected the ruins, while officials placed the soggy remnant of a red carpet in front of them, snatching it up as they passed to relay it again in front. <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/54198/Sir-Charles-Barry\" title=\"\">Charles Barry</a> viewed the blaze with a professional eye: \"What a chance,\" he remarked \"for an architect.\" Some people thought that if the unpopular new Poor Law had been burned it was no longer the law, while those who hired out cabs or ran pubs in the area enjoyed bumper takings, as did pickpockets. The wider consequences took time to be felt, but they were tremendous. The need for a single public fire brigade was established. A national debate about architecture, gothic versus classical, erupted in the press as the possibilities for a replacement building were considered before Barry did eventually get the job. More generally, a new order was established in political life. The king's peremptory decision to dissolve Parliament that December was a last overplaying of the royal hand. No monarch ever exercised the prerogative again.</p> <p>The new palace embodied a dawning Victorian age of order. The archivist Henry Cole, later the mastermind of the Great Exhibition, catalogued more than 4,000 parchment rolls of ministerial accounts and stored them in strong boxes. Record keeping, fire precautions and a further flushing out of sinecures ensued. The old palace was, to a surprising degree, wiped from historic memory. One of the many achievements of Shenton's scholarly but gripping account is to revive, in all its intricacy and richness, the ghost of one of London's greatest lost treasures.</p> <p>\u2022 Rosemary Hill's <em>God's Architect: Pugin and the Building of Romantic Britain</em> is published by Penguin.</p>",
  "<p>Thousands of workers at Foxconn in China have gone on strike over working conditions related to production of the iPhone 5.</p> <p>Three to four thousand employees walked out of Foxconn's Zhengzhou factory on Friday, according to China Labor Watch. It said Foxconn and Apple had \"raised overly strict demands on product quality\" without providing adequate training.</p> <p>The strike comes just weeks after Foxconn was forced to close a plant in Taiyuan, when a brawl involving as many as 2,000 workers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/24/foxconn-closes-china-factory-brawl\">left a number of people needing hospital treatment</a>.</p> <p>China Labor Watch, a labor rights group which monitors factory conditions in China, said Friday's strike came after Foxconn and Apple introduced new quality controls, while at the same time Foxconn forced employees to work during a public holiday.</p> <p>\"Foxconn raised overly strict demands on product quality without providing worker training for the corresponding skills. This led to workers turning out products that did not meet standards, and ultimately put a tremendous amount of pressure on workers,\" China Labor Watch said in a statement.</p> <p>The organisation said the new quality demands led to workers turning out products that did not meet production standard, placing \"a tremendous amount of pressure on workers\".</p> <p>\"Additionally, quality control inspectors fell into to conflicts with workers and were beaten up multiple times by workers. Factory management turned a deaf ear to complaints about these conflicts and took no corrective measures.\"</p> <p>The majority of Foxconn employees taking part in the strike worked on the \"onsite quality control line\", according to China Labor Watch. It said the strike meant iPhone 5 production lines were \"in a state of paralysis for the entire day\".</p> <p>The organisation said Apple was involved in some of the reasons for the dispute, pressing ahead with production demands despite design problems. The new quality demands included \"indentations standards of 0.02mm and demands related to scratches on frames and back covers\" China Labor Watch said.</p> <p>It said the pressure of the new quality demands, coupled with workers not being permitted to take vacation during a recent holiday period, had led to the strike.</p> <p>\"This strike is a result of the fact that these workers just have too much pressure,\" said CLW executive director Li Qiang.</p> <p>In September Foxconn was forced to shut a plant in Taiyuan, northern China, after a mass brawl. As many as 2,000 workers were said to have been involved in the violence, with pictures showing smashed windows and riot police at the site. Geoffrey Crothall, a spokesman for the pressure group China Labor Bulletin, said at the time that Foxconn workers were becoming increasingly emboldened.</p> <p>\"They're more willing to stand up for their rights, to stand up to injustice,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>\"Keep an eye out for John Travolta!\" laughs our driver, as we peer out of the taxi window, hoping to spot a warthog or two in the African bush. We are on our way to the swish Shamwari Game Reserve in South Africa's Eastern Cape, one of the world's leading luxury safari destinations, and occasional retreat for various species of celebrity.</p> <p>Shamwari has not only won award after award for its conservation efforts and impeccable hospitality record, it has somehow even managed to keep the hordes of the online review community happy. Slightly perturbed by the gushing reviews of the place (one reviewer even claimed to be overcome with tears of happiness when remembering his experience), I have a slight niggle before we arrive that I may not get the rugged and authentic safari experience I've been looking forward to.</p> <p>My boyfriend Tony and I arrive at Shamwari with only 10 minutes until our first game drive. Our ranger, Ryan, gives a passionate introduction to the reserve, explaining the rich and diverse ecosystem (which contains five out of the seven South African \"biomes\") within a 25,000-hectare malaria-free plot. He asks our newly formed group of six what we'd like to see most and on the face of it seems enthused by our almost collective response \u2013 lions.</p> <p>Ryan's genuine enthusiasm for what he does is matched by the speed at which he drives. We skid down valleys, bounce out of our seatbelts and streak through mud in pursuit of a dot on the horizon. The land is thick with pine bushes, like huge oversized brittle dandelions, positioned against the dense green vegetation and scorched red soil. The bush is vast and stark, and there is a simple pleasure in feeling lost and small within it.</p> <p>Shamwari's well-managed system, whereby rangers radio each other with key sightings, means that after a couple of drives we've been about a metre away from most of the big five. Highlights included: seeing the elephant calf feeding from its mother (a reminder that there really is milk and flesh inside these massive clay units); the agility of the baby rhino (so swift and light of foot I felt I could blow her one-tonne weight over in one breath); and feeling trapped by a leopard's fixed glare as we intruded on her mating territory (which quickly turned the usual zoo dynamic of \"the viewer\" and \"the viewed\" on its head).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-403849812\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349283001588/Spot-the-local---a-leopar-001.jpg\" alt=\"Spot the local \u2026 a leopard crosses the tourists\u2019 track\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spot the local \u2026 a leopard crosses the tourists\u2019 track</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Janette Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The natural excitement of being outdoors and on the game drive is amplified by brilliant stage management by the Shamwari staff. We break for lunch in the middle of the bush, to find a table, ready-laid with silver cutlery, champagne and enough fresh food to keep us going for a week. We return from another game drive, bones cold from the wind, to ostrich crudit\u00e9s, hot towels and Decleor facials. The transition between creature and comfort is so seamless you have to remind yourself that it isn't every day you stop to have a G&amp;T at sundown in a field of impala.</p> <p>Shamwari has luxury accommodation in six lodges, and also offers a back-to-basics option in its Explorer Camp. We're staying at Bayethe Lodge, described as \"luxury tented accommodation\". It is more akin to a Grand Designs thatched house: creatively laid out (a six-metre-high spire roof, freestanding bath and plunge pool), with nice touches (spotlights entwined in branches above our bed, and our pillows arranged like flowers).</p> <p>Evenings alternate between private dinners and group <em>braais</em> (barbecues, with our ranger). At the latter we talk about safaris: the high costs, the pressure on land, the need to control animal numbers to maintain the delicate ecosystem, the push to provide employment to local South Africans. Shamwari is home to indigenous wildlife only, and even at full capacity the reserve accommodates relatively few guests, to ensure the land is preserved and reclaimed as much as possible. Behind the scenes Shamwari also has a breeding centre, an anti-poaching unit, a rehabilitation centre for abandoned or injured animals and an education facility which partners with local schools in the area.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-403849813\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349283040519/Creatures-and-comforts----001.jpg\" alt=\"Creatures and comforts \u2026 Bayethe Lodge\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Creatures and comforts \u2026 Bayethe Lodge</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the luxury and scale of Shamwari, the rangers are the stars of the show. Ryan's genuine love of the environment shines through any manufactured feel. His admiration for the whole ecosystem ensures that this is not just a whistlestop tour around the Big Five. We chew <em>spekboom</em> \u2013 a succulent known as elephant bush \u2013 and understand from its sweet taste why elephants like it so much, we taste aloe, hold dung from black and white rhino in our hands to learn how to spot evidence of the black rhino's hooked upper lip and \"browser\" diet. Ryan's skilled at teaching us to slow down, appreciate whatever comes our way and challenge our own preconceptions of what we will enjoy most.</p> <p>When we go on a trail walk, the dramatic belly of the bush comes to life and for a couple of hours we become part of the landscape. There is a huge variety of birdlife at Shamwari and the trail walk lets us experience the flame-licked wings of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knysna_Turaco\" title=\"\">Knysna touraco</a>, the guttural blare of the heron and the orange belly of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/grrlscientist/2012/jan/01/3\" title=\"\">Malachite kingfisher</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Towards the end of the week the drives become more relaxed. We spend half an hour listening to the melancholy call of the African fish eagle; we opt for watching springbok leaping into the air (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5IJBbA6UkA\" title=\"\">pronking</a>) over a rumoured leopard sighting; we track a lion by following her footprints and trying to analyse the behaviour of the antelope that are spread out around her. When we eventually find her we follow her until it gets dark.</p> <p>In our taxi to the airport the driver asks if we saw Prince William or Oprah Winfrey. Despite experiencing all the luxuries that Shamwari has to offer, it's the first time all week that I'm reminded of my earlier concerns about a sanitized safari experience.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Janette Smith won in the accommodation category in the 2011 competition.

  "<p>The number of people in the US confirmed to have been infected by meningitis from a contaminated steroid injection increased on Friday to 47, as clinics faced questions about buying from an unaccredited firm with a history of violating safety standards.</p> <p>As hospitals rushed to trace patients who may have been given the steroid, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there had been no new fatalities but that a further 12 patients had been struck down by illness. Five people have died after being infected by the rare form of fungal meningitis.</p> <p>Health officials have traced the outbreak to the New England Compounding Center in Framingham, Massachusetts, which sent out more than 17,000 doses of contaminated steroid injections.</p> <p>Investigators from the Food and Drug Administration who were sent to the firm after the outbreak found a fungal contaminate in a sealed vial of the steroid, methylprednisolone acetate. They also found a \"foreign material\" in another, opened container. Tests are being conducted to determine if the contaminants match the one that has led to recent cases of meningitis.</p> <p>On Friday, the Guardian made repeated calls to the homes of the owner of New England Compounding Center and its president. All such calls went unanswered and the company's website had been taken down.</p> <p>A history of failings at the company has emerged. The New York Times quoted Dr Madeleine Biondolillo, director of the Bureau of Health Care Safety and Quality at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, as saying that complaints had been registered against the company in 2002 and 2003 and earlier this year.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2006/ucm076196.htm\">A 2006 warning letter from the FDA to company boss Barry Cadden</a> cited a string of health and safety violations. They included the misbranding of drugs and the copying of FDA-approved, commercially available products.</p> <p>Investigators expressed special concern over the company's practice of splitting an injectable drug, Avastin, into multiple doses to be sold on. The move could lead to \"potential microbial contamination\", the letter said. The FDA also noted that Avastin is approved only for use in treatment of colorectal cancers. New England Compounding Center was marketing the drug to ophthalmologists, despite it having \"no approved indications for use in the eye\".</p> <p>Mr Cadden was warned: \"Your firm is distributing an unapproved new drug.\" But despite such violations of health and safety standards, the firm continued to operate.</p> <p>Compounding pharmacists have long been on the radar of federal regulators. In a 2007 document, the FDA said it was scrutinising the industry \"mainly because of instances where compounded drugs have endangered public health\". Compounding pharmacists mix or alter ingredients according to the needs of individual patients.</p> <p>\"In its traditional form, pharmacy compounding is a vital service that helps many people, including those who are allergic to inactive ingredients in FDA-approved medicines, and others who need medications that are not available commercially,\" Kathleen Anderson, then the deputy director of the FDA's division of new drugs and labelling compliance, stated in the 2007 public health information document.</p> <p>However, the compounds produced are not FDA-approved. Moreover, poor practice can lead to contamination, as seems to be the case in the latest meningitis outbreak. Such infections have led to deaths and injury.</p> <p>In 2006, three patients died due to contaminated solutions that had been used to paralyse the heart during open-heart surgery. In 2005, at the Veterans Affairs hospital in Washington DC, two people were blinded by bacteria in a batch of drugs used during cataract operations. In 2011, nine patients at hospitals in Alabama died after receiving intravenous nutritional supplements that were infected with a lethal bacteria. It had been prepared by a pharmacy compounder in Birmingham.</p> <p>Defenders of the practice have suggested that rogue operators are to blame and that in the latest outbreak, regulators and the clinics affected could be at fault.</p> <p>David Miller, executive vice president and chief executive of the International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists, said that the New England Compounding Center was not accredited and had been guilty of past health violations. He also said that the large quantity of doses prepared by the firm seemed to put it at odds with rest of the industry.</p> <p>\"There were more than 17,000 doses put together by the pharmacy. How is it possible they had 17,000 individual doses? It looks like there were working with the drug manufacturers. If that was how it was being done, that is in contrast to traditional compounding,\" said Miller, whose body represents more than 2,700 compounding pharmacists across the US.</p> <p>Miller also questioned why clinics in states as far away as Tennessee and Florida were using drugs that had been prepared in Massachusetts.</p> <p>\"Something doesn't feel right,\" he said. \"The more you look at this the more questions come up \u2013 this was not a traditional pharmaceutical compounder. It doesn't make sense. We do not know why there are buying from this pharmacist. Was it price? What due diligence did the clinics do to make sure it was licensed and accredited, which it was not?\"</p> <p>Miller rejected claims that regulation of the industry needs to be tightened up.</p> <p>He said: \"Compounding pharmacists, just like all other pharmacists in the US, are regulated by three different government agencies: the state board of pharmacies, the FDA and the DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration]. There is plenty of regulation. The question that needs to be answered is whether or not this pharmacist was in compliance with state and federal laws.\"</p> <p>Only one of the clinics affected in the latest outbreak returned the Guardian's phone calls on Friday, to explain why it bought drugs from a compounder, rather than from bigger pharmaceutical companies.</p> <p>A representative from Greenspring Surgery Centre in Maryland \u2013 which is contacting patients it knows to have been given steroids from the Massacusetts firm \u2013 said it bought from compounders \"because sometimes there are formulations of medications that are unavailable commercially. This is a commercial product. But whether you buy it from a large or a small company, they all have the same standards that have to be met.\"</p> <p>Asked if there was a cost consideration, the spokesman, who declined to be identified, said: \"Sometimes there is, sometimes there isn't. In this case there wasn't, it was actually an availability issue and an issue of having the right medication, the right dosage.</p> <p>\"There has been a scarcity of multiple medications over the last couple of years and that has created a need to reach out to multiple suppliers.\"</p>",
  "<p>A massive clampdown on trade union activities in the civil service is to be announced at the Tory party conference in a move that will infuriate the largest civil service union, the PCS, and possibly threaten attendance at its annual conference.</p> <p>The Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude is to announce that no trade union member in the civil service will be allowed to spend more than half their paid time on trade union duties. Any exemptions will require specific ministerial sign off and will be published online.</p> <p>All departments are also being advised they are not allow more than 0.1% of the pay bill to be devoted to union duties, down from the present 0.26% average.</p> <p>A new default position is to be introduced that assumes paid time off for trade union activities, such as attending union conferences, will not be granted. A new regulation will block those who spend all their time on union work from being promoted.</p> <p>The proposals go further than expected when Maude launched a consultation document in the summer.</p> <p>A Cabinet Office source said: \"We recognise that trade unions play an important role in the modern workplace but we think trade union facility time arrangements in the civil service should reflect those in business and the wider public sector.</p> <p>\"Some civil servants have spent well over a decade doing nothing but trade union work and have even been promoted while doing so. That just isn't fair to the taxpayer or to other civil servants\".</p> <p>Research accumulated by Maude shows 6,800 representatives are working on trade union duties, 1,000 officials are working as health and safety representatives and 1,000 are skills and learning representatives.</p> <p>One department admitted that \"no formal allocations [had been] made or central records kept\" of the amount of time spent by representatives on some union activity, while another confessed that \"no central monitoring takes place\".</p> <p>At the time of the consultation, the PCS said: \"The very small proportion of work time that is allowed is more than justified by the huge organisational and economic benefits that it brings and it is absolutely right that this is publicly funded.\"</p> <p>The Maude announcement, certain to delight the party faithful, is due to come on the day chancellor George Osborne makes his set piece speech to conference, and the day before the London mayor Boris Johnson speaks to conference in potentially the most highly charged moment of next week's conference.</p> <p>Johnson will use his speech to call for more powers for the London mayor \u2013 including full control of the proceeds of stamp duty in the greater London area, which Johnson would use to fund a wave of housebuilding and regeneration schemes across the city.</p> <p>There are growing signs that Tory euro-sceptics plan to use the conference to demand greater clarity on Europe, including the possible \u00a330bn merger of BAE Systems with its European rival EADS. More than 40 Conservative MPs have signed a letter calling on the prime minister to block the deal unless the French and German governments give up their stakes in the new company.</p> <p>The 45 MPs called on David Cameron to use the government's \"golden share\" in BAE to win assurances that the merger would pose no danger to national security and that there will be no weakening of Britain's special defence links with the US.</p> <p>The letter was released after the former chancellor Alistair Darling warned in the Financial Times that Britain would be \"taken to the cleaners\" unless the British government took a direct stake.</p> <p>In the letter, organised by the Tory MP Ben Wallace, the MPs say: \"The proposed takeover of BAE systems by EADS raises a significant number of issues which have profound consequences for Britain.</p> <p>\"Not only does her majesty's government have an obligation to make a political decision on the takeover, as the guardian of the 'golden share', but it also has a duty to safeguard Britain's national security and economic interests.</p> <p>\"We are concerned at a proposal which will put the bulk of Britain's defence industrial base in the hands of a company predominantly owned by the French and German governments. It has a German CEO and a headquarters already split between France and Holland. Without some vital safeguards we do not think that this deal will be in the UK's national nor manufacturing interest.\"</p> <p>Wallace is MP for Wyre and Preston North and many of his constituents work at the BAE plant at Warton.</p> <p>The merger of BAE and EADS would create the largest defence contractor in the world. BAE is keen for the deal to go ahead to help it cope with the impact of defence cuts around the world. EADS would like to use BAE's position in Washington to break into the US market.</p>",
  "<p>The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, who has only been in post for a few weeks, says that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/03/west-coast-rail-contract\" title=\"\">civil servants were to blame for the blunders </a>over the west coast mainline franchise, and that heads will roll. However, Gus O'Donnell, former head of the home civil service, countered that it is \"self-defeating\" to attack officials, and that ministers are to blame for failing to ensure that salaries are sufficient to secure properly skilled staff. Who is right?</p> <p>The constitutional principle is clear. Ministers take the credit when things go right and accept the blame when things go wrong. The trouble is that most ministers are prepared to accept only the first part of this principle.</p> <p>The principle does not mean that officials are immune from blame. They should be, and often are, reprimanded when mistakes are made \u2013 and, in extreme circumstances, can be dismissed. But while ministers can publicly blame their officials, the officials cannot reply. It is too easy, therefore, for ministers to offload responsibility on to officials.</p> <p>The organisation and competence of the civil service is a ministerial responsibility. It was therefore for ministers to ensure that officials had the necessary skills, and it was for ministers to scrutinise the minutiae before assuring parliament that all was in order. Justine Greening, transport secretary until September, is a qualified accountant and was apparently made aware of some defects in the west coast bidding process. Is she entirely free of blame? And perhaps the whole franchise process was flawed in requiring bidders to predict revenue growth over 15 years.</p> <p>Had the process been a success, ministers would not have declared that the credit belonged to their officials. Should they not also take the blame when the process fails? A system in which ministers take the credit for successes while officials take the blame for failure is hardly conducive to good government.</p> <p>There is, then, a wider crisis in relations between ministers and civil servants. Today <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e24cd510-0e30-11e2-8b92-00144feabdc0.html#axzz28PyezeJ2\" title=\"\">it was reported that senior officers are furious</a> over the way they have been treated over the rail fiasco, and believe they have been \"scapegoated\". The Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin, chair of the public administration select committee, believes that officials are becoming \"angry and demotivated\".</p> <p>The civil service has been subject to endless \"managerial\" reforms since the late 1980s, which have done little to improve efficiency but have been destructive of morale. Perhaps confidence can only be restored through a royal commission, chaired by someone who really understands how the civil service works.</p> <p>The danger is that the crisis fuels demands for greater political control of the civil service. This week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/04/west-coast-mainline-civil-service\" title=\"\">Francis Maude, minister for the Cabinet Office, said</a> that ministers should play a greater part in the selection and appraisal of senior officials. But the greater the political influence on the civil service, the greater the danger that officials become hesitant to speak truth to power.</p> <p>Failings in the civil service often reflect the weakness of its political masters. Effective ministers \u2013 such as Lord Adonis in the Labour government and Nigel Lawson under the Conservatives \u2013 do not attack their civil servants or accuse them of obstruction. They know what they want to achieve, and by and large succeed. During the war and under the peacetime administrations of Winston Churchill and Clement Attlee, many mistakes were made. But neither Churchill nor Attlee would ever have dreamt of publicly attacking their officials.</p> <p>Once, during the war, Lord Alanbrooke, chief of the imperial general staff, was very rough with Churchill in front of other ministers. A crony of the prime minister's told Alanbrooke that Churchill thought the chief hated him. Alanbrooke replied that he did not hate the prime minister, \"but the first time I tell him that I agree with him when I don't will be the time to get rid of me, for then I can be of no more use to him\". That is the relationship that ministers should cultivate with their officials.</p>",
  "<p>Banker bashing is still a national pastime following the financial crash and Libor-fixing scandal. But could we be approaching a time when we have to acknowledge that banks might be good for Britain? Former London mayor Ken Livingstone, who earlier this year quipped, \"Hang a banker a week until the others improve\", takes on investment banker Anthony Fry. Aida Edemariam referees.</p> <p><strong>Anthony Fry:</strong> If you're in my position, you have to start with some admissions. The majority of banks were extremely poorly managed. They completely failed to promote the right culture within their organisations. They failed to protect their corporate reputations. And those things contributed to the irresponsible behaviour of a minority of people. But when you think about the number of people who have been extremely hard-working, honourable, and doing a very good job, we run the risk of throwing the baby out with the bathwater.</p> <p><strong>Ken Livingstone:</strong> The majority of people who work for banks aren't that well paid and had no role in the financial collapse. But the last 200 years of capitalism has been a cycle of banks taking terrible risks, catastrophic collapse, tight regulation, and 50 years on, seducing politicians to removing the controls. Let's have a Glass\u2013Steagall (the separation of investment and commercial banking, introduced under Roosevelt) for modern&#xa0;times \u2013 that's essentially what Miliband's come out for&#xa0;this week.</p> <p><strong>Aida Edemariam:</strong> As mayor, you presided over the biggest financial boom in London's history; the City spilled out into Mayfair, Savile Row, along the South Bank to the Shard. It changed London.</p> <p><strong>KL:</strong> There are huge benefits. What I've always said to the mayors of Shanghai and Mumbai is \u2013 if you want to be a great international financial centre, you've got to allow about 30% of the population to be foreigners. Because that's what New York and London's got.</p> <p><strong>AF:</strong> It also has an acceptance of the rule of law \u2013 though one of the reasons that antagonism towards the banking community has lasted so long has been that to date not a single person on either side of the Atlantic has been penalised, other than at the margins. I agree with Ken \u2013 I think that being a financial centre brings benefits.</p> <p><strong>AE:</strong> For the average person? Really?</p> <p><strong>AF:</strong> The most remarkable thing about the Olympics was that all 204 nations had a community in this city. Never before has that happened. That is, partly, because London is an attractive place for large numbers of people to come, despite some massive social problems.</p> <p><strong>AE:</strong> However international London gets, wherever people come from, they have to live somewhere. In the boom, Ken, it became a city where no working-class person could live in the centre. The middle class is just hanging on. That's a&#xa0;strange legacy for a&#xa0;socialist mayor.</p> <p><strong>KL:</strong> That's not the fault of the bankers.</p> <p><strong>AE:</strong> It's an effect of what bankers did.</p> <p><strong>KL:</strong> That's the fault of politicians. We used to build, in Britain, over 200,000 homes a year, and about half were council housing. Thatcher stopped building. Blair carried that on. So throughout the 1980s and 90s we were building about half the homes we needed to, to cope with the demand. That's why prices have gone through the roof.</p> <p><strong>AE:</strong> But it's not just that. There has been&#xa0;so much money, bankers' bonuses going into housing stock.</p> <p><strong>KL:</strong> We have a shortage of supply, so the price will rise. The way to deal with that is either a vast regulatory system like something out of the old Soviet Union, or you just build more housing.</p> <p><strong>AF:</strong> There are lots of ironies about the crisis. There was one bank that supposedly had the best structure for making sure the interests of investors, depositors and so forth were aligned, and that was Lehman Brothers \u2013 which I worked for briefly \u2013 where more than half of people's compensation was paid in Lehman stock, which you had to hold. No matter what you did, clerical, secretarial, the janitor, you got Lehmans stock. When Lehman Brothers collapsed they were the biggest losers. So you've got to be careful. The bonus question is twofold. As you start realigning, you end up with unintended consequences. Again, coming back to politicians \u2013 they ran with the hares and hunted with the hounds. The fact is, in the early 2000s, big cash bonuses were being taxed at 50%. This was a windfall for the treasury. I would argue that successive politicians failed to invest the monies they were getting in sustainable ways. If you have a growing population and you don't have many houses, you will end up with a house boom that is worsened by bonuses, but not created by bonuses.</p> <p><strong>KL:</strong> Part of the problem is politicians. We, for political reasons \u2013 and Blair carried on with this \u2013 were encouraged to buy. We encouraged borrowing.</p> <p><strong>AE:</strong> When you say politicians you're including yourself?</p> <p><strong>KL:</strong> Oh no, I never did. Every single one of the 13 budgets I produced \u2013 five at the GLC, the rest as mayor \u2013 every one was balanced. We only ever borrowed for investment \u2013 things like Crossrail. Revenue budget was always in balance. If I'd been given the powers of the chancellor, this would be a different economy. My real damnation of the Blair-Brown government is that they didn't build homes for people to live in, and they neglected our manufacturing.</p> <p><strong>AF:</strong> Like it or not, governments are going to need banks to get the cash flowing. We need thousands of homes. That's just a fact. We must find a way of moving on, because perception is driving reality. The debate is getting lost in extreme language. Words like cesspit \u2026</p> <p><strong>AE:</strong> Or hang the bankers \u2026</p> <p><strong>AF:</strong> Indeed, but I took that as Ken's wit.</p> <p><strong>AE:</strong> You both keep talking about regulation, but for the person in the street it's neither here nor there. For them, nothing has changed, or it's got worse, they've lost their job or their benefits.</p> <p><strong>AF:</strong> The banks didn't say to governments, go off and borrow X amount of the GDP every year! Governments did it for a variety of reasons, quite a lot of which were political. If they borrowed money and supported programmes that put money directly into people's pockets, as opposed to investing in infrastructure, the inevitable result was that they borrowed too much money.</p> <p><em>Ken Livingstone and Anthony Fry will be taking part in an Intelligence Squared debate on this subject at London's Royal Geographical Society on Tuesday at 7pm.

  "<p>For the England women's cricket team, the beginning of the slog to the summit can probably be traced back to 5 May 2010, a disastrous day on St Kitts, when they played Australia in a group match of the World Twenty20, Murphy's Law kicked in, and anything that could go wrong did, and did so in spades. The result was the tightest imaginable, with scores finishing level, a super-over eliminator doing likewise, and Australia deemed winners on countback because of the single six struck earlier in the match by their batsman Jess Cameron.</p> <p>It does not however tell the story of the complete mess England made of that match, in which Clare Taylor, the world's leading female batsman, was run out without facing a ball and then unaccountably flagged through to the wicketkeeper the first ball of the super over. Nor does it tell of the England captain Charlotte Edwards, not a regular bowler, deciding to bowl the last over of the match herself, with eight runs needed, sending down a high full toss first ball, which was dispatched to the boundary.</p> <p>It was an appallingly executed match by a team who held the World Cup and the World T20 titles and were strong favourites to retain the latter. Having lost that match, and deflated by the performance, they then lost to West Indies and were eliminated from the competition having not even reached the semi-finals.</p> <p>Since then, progress in T20 cricket, the best format for women's cricket, has been little short of astonishing. In July of that year, they twice were beaten at home by New Zealand, but since then, they have lost only twice \u2013 to Australia in Canberra last year, and to West Indies in their last home game of last summer \u2013 in 33 matches.</p> <p>It is a run of success quite possibly unprecedented by any British team, male or female, in any sport, and it makes Edwards arguably the nation's most prolific leader of all. From it Sarah Taylor has emerged, in her capacity as a wicketkeeper-batsman of genuine first-class standard, as arguably the best female cricketer of all time, and the astounding Lydia Greenway as its finest fielder. England have kept ahead of the game and intend to continue doing so.</p> <p>There is a story here of the benefits of proper funding and investment, a challenging mission statement, massively increased security and status for the players, increased participation levels and therefore more competition for places, and, crucially, a top flight academy and performance programme.</p> <p>Players are not yet centrally contracted (although that may come eventually, the current fear being only that there simply would not be enough to do) but most are in cricket-related employment for 100 days of the year. Seven players work as coaches and ambassadors for Chance to Shine, the organisation that takes cricket into schools, and 12, including Sarah Taylor and Dani Wyatt, are on the MCC groundstaff from April to September, as part of the MCC Women Young Cricketers programme, delivered by the England Women's coach Mark Lane, a superb coach utterly empathetic to the demands of female cricket.</p> <p>From cricket, when factoring in touring fees, allowances and match fees that can be doubled by winning, Clare Connor, the former England captain and now the England and Wales Cricket Board's director of women's cricket, reckons that for 100 days pro-rata, the top players' earnings are more than in any other female team sport in the UK.</p> <p>The support of the ECB has been crucial. Since Connor presented a paper to the board several years ago, everything, within reason, has been put in place, to the envy of other less well resourced nations. The women's game is flourishing. Edwards and others have been involved in Chance to Shine since 2008 and by this year they had introduced more than one million children to the game of which 48% have been girls, 160,000 of them this year alone. In a decade, the number of clubs with women's sections has grown from 93 to 560. Every one of the 39 county cricket boards has age group girls teams at U17, U15 and U13 level. Connor has at her disposal a team of 12 selectors and scouts on a regional basis, with a sophisticated talent identification system and data base.</p> <p>Competition to get into the national side is fierce. In Connor's time, up until 2005, there was little: the team was all but set in stone. Now there is a stringent path to follow, involving the best identified 52 over-16 county players competing in the Super 4s programme, in which they are each allocated one of four equally balanced teams who then play each other in both T20 and 50 over matches. Connor estimates they now have 20 players competing for squad places, each capable of playing in a final eleven. Such is the depth of ability that this summer the Academy team beat the national teams of West Indies and Pakistan.</p> <p>The drive to improve has been relentless. In preparation for global tournaments, England and the academy have played as much cricket as possible in different environments including Sri Lanka. Their training camps are intensive and include strength and conditioning, skills, nutrition, spin, diving techniques in the field, sweeping and all the small things that make a difference. In short, they are successful in no small part because they are better prepared.</p> <p>But herein lies one overriding problem: the better they become, the less challenged they are. Two teams \u2013 England and Australia \u2013 dominate, with West Indies, India and New Zealand a tier below, and the remainder below them.</p> <p>When Australia's men's team reached that level of domination they included their A team in their own tournaments and concocted a game against the Rest of the World. For the integrity of women's international cricket the ICC, through investment, needs to close the competitive gap, through following the England model, helping create more bilateral cricket and robust domestic competitions.</p> <p>That, though, will not stop the England drive to remain at the top. The more input they give them, says Connor, the more they want. \"They are hungry for success. It is what drives them.\"</p>",
  "<p>In <a href=\"http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1959/jul/27/hola-camp-kenya-report#S5CV0610P0_19590727_HOC_543\" title=\"\">a celebrated speech at Westminster in 1959</a>, then-Tory backbencher Enoch Powell suggested it would be a betrayal of everything England believed its colonial mission was about if the authorities tried to evade responsibility for the massacre of Mau Mau suspects at the Hola detention camp. More than 50 years later, a British government is still trying to evade responsibility for the torture of Kenyans in similar camps throughout the 1950s.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/05/kenyans-tortured-by-british\" title=\"\">The government does not dispute that torture took place: it could not</a>. The case has brought to light literally thousands of documents detailing how the authorities ignored and often collaborated in inhuman treatment of detainees. The argument is <a href=\"http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/mutua-fco-judgment-05102012.pdf\" title=\"\">whether the British government now can be held responsible for the actions of a semi-autonomous colonial administration</a> two generations ago. On Friday, the three surviving claimants of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/05/mau-mau-veterans-win-torture-case\" title=\"\">the four Kenyan detainees who began an action for compensation in 2009 were finally told their case could go ahead</a>.</p> <p>On the face of it this is a simple matter of justice. Whatever the context \u2013 and the Mau Mau were themselves responsible for the brutal murder of many Christian Kenyans \u2013 thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands, of people were interned and tortured into confessing their membership of the organisation. Senior colonial officials were entangled in their own double standards, privately acknowledging that any inquiry that exposed the brutality of the camps could fatally undermine any lingering legitimacy of British rule. Instead, they secretly colluded in abuse. It grew on, unchecked \u2013 until the Hola massacre occurred. After that, it was impossible to pretend it wasn't happening.</p> <p>And that is the bigger reason why the government must stop procrastinating and accept responsibility for events that happened before many of its members were born. It is true that most of the officials involved are long dead. But it was not only a question of individual failure. Abuse was sanctioned by a particular institutional attitude that has never been adequately challenged. So, in differing ways, it has gone on: from the Malay emergency to Cyprus and from Northern Ireland to the war on terror.</p> <p>It is a cliche to point out that challenges to state authority pose particular problems but still governments forget that the success that seems to its perpetrators to justify abuse turns out to be short-lived. Trying to uphold the rule of law by ignoring it doesn't work. Nor is admitting that we haven't always got it right the same as saying that everything British governments have done is wrong. <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2010/02/powell-speech-kenya-hola\" title=\"\">As Enoch Powell recognised</a>, the only possible way of sustaining trust is to admit when that trust has been betrayed.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron has failed to end the Tories' image as the party of the rich and is paying the price as Conservatives struggle to extend their appeal to urban areas in the north of England, according to the head of Downing Street's favourite thinktank.</p> <p>In a searing critique of the prime minister's faltering modernisation project, the director of Policy Exchange, Neil O'Brien, calls for an urgent round of renewal in the light of Cameron's failure to heal the \"party's worst wounds\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/05/conservatives-new-workers-party\" title=\"\">Writing for the Guardian on the eve of the Conservative conference</a> in Birmingham, O'Brien says: \"The Tories urgently need a new round of renewal. Tory modernisation has not yet healed the party's worst wounds. It is still seen as the party of the rich. It does badly in urban areas, particularly outside the south-east.\"</p> <p>The intervention by O'Brien, whose thinktank has been an intellectual powerhouse for so-called \"Cameroons\", reflects the concerns among many modernisers that the project to detoxify the image of the Tories has stalled. It was designed to show that the Tories, who were famously described in 2002 by Theresa May, now the home secretary, as the \"nasty party\", reflected modern, diverse Britain. Cameron famously broke with the past, and highlighted his green credentials, by posing with huskies on a visit to Svalbard in the Norwegian Arctic in 2006.</p> <p>On Friday, in another blow for the government, Europe's environment chief highlighted concerns in the EU that the coalition is failing to live up to its pledge to become Britain's greenest ever government by accusing critics of environmental regulations of making \"untrue\" claims.</p> <p>Janez Potocnik, the European environment commissioner, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/05/tories-warned-eu-green-agenda\" title=\"\">told the Guardian</a> that for politicians to suggest that environmental legislation was a burden was \"very unhelpful, because it is untrue\".</p> <p>The commissioner did not name any Tory ministers. But chancellor George Osborne has criticised green regulations.</p> <p>Separately, in a Guardian interview before the Conservative conference, the new culture secretary, Maria Miller, claimed the government was acting in a progressive way as it lifts 2 million of the lowest earners out of tax.</p> <p>Miller, who is also minister for women and equalities, said: \"When you look at what we have been doing for the last two and a half years, so much of it does resonate with women. If you look at what we have done in terms of focusing on cutting the deficit, welfare reform and tax reforms \u2013 lifting 2 million of the lowest paid people out of tax altogether disproportionately supports women who can often have part-time jobs.\"</p> <p>Miller declined to join the campaign to end the Sun's Page 3 girl, saying: \"It is for newspapers to decide what they print and it is for consumers to decide what they buy. That is the way it should be, and I don't think it is right for ministers to dictate what goes on any page of a newspaper, whether it is page 3 or not.\"</p> <p>In his Guardian article, O'Brien calls for \"blue collar modernisation\" focused on the north and the Midlands which would see the end of middle-class benefits. \"What about middle-class benefits?\" he asks. \"Do we really need to give child benefit to households that are better off than average? Post-election we should stop giving free TV licences, winter fuel payments and bus passes to millionaires.\"</p> <p>O'Brien says the prime minister must resist calls from the Tory right, notably the new Conservative Voice group, to champion a more traditional agenda.</p> <p>\"Obviously Cameron should ignore calls from the usual suspects to lurch rightward. But the solution isn't as simple as tacking to the centre. After all, most voters have tough views on crime, welfare and immigration. What's needed is a blue-collar modernisation, focused on the north and Midlands.\"</p> <p>Amid continuing concerns about the failure of the Tory party to appeal to British minority ethnic communities, O'Brien calls on the prime minister to renounce the so called \"cricket test\" set by Lord Tebbit. The former Tory chairman famously said in 1990 that members of minority communities could not be considered fully British if they supported the cricket team of their country of ancestry rather than England.</p> <p>\"Supporting Pakistan or the Windies at cricket is no more evidence that someone has failed to integrate than wearing a kilt to a wedding is proof of Jacobite sympathies. You can be intensely British, but want to hold on to your family history.\"</p> <p>The prime minister will on Saturday try to draw a line under one issue that harmed the Tory brand \u2013 Andrew Lansley's health reforms \u2013 when he unveils a \u00a3140m fund to help reduce paperwork.</p> <p>In a visit to a hospital, Cameron will announce that \u00a3100m will be invested in new software to cut form filling and \u00a340m to train 10,000 nurses and midwives for greater leadership roles in the NHS.</p> <p>In marked contrast with Lansley, who found himself at odds with most professional medical bodies, the new health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, will say: \"The importance of these issues was laid bare by doctors' and nursing leaders this week. The government's role is to listen to the NHS and support these leaders \u2013 that's what we're doing today.\"</p>",
  "<p>The government of the ironies dances on. This week the story was the assault on the 24-week abortion limit. Its advocate is the minister for women, Maria Miller, who is, she says, \"a very modern feminist\" \u2013 a phrase I can barely type without laughing. Her voting record includes seeking to deny fertility treatment to lesbians; but such views are no bar to promotion in this administration, even to the equality throne. She told the Telegraph <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9581895/Maria-Miller-I-would-vote-to-lower-abortion-limit-from-24-to-20-weeks.html\" title=\"\">that she supported a ban on abortion after 20 weeks</a>, which I suppose is better than the madness of Jeremy Hunt at health. He sits at his desk and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/abortion-rights-protest-jeremy-hunt\" title=\"\">fondly yearns for 12</a>.</p> <p>Miller said: \"You have got to look at these matters in a very commonsense way. I looked at it from the really important stance of the impact on women and children. What we are trying to do here is not to put obstacles in people's way but to reflect the way medical science has moved on.\" Let us ignore the irony of a Conservative minister claiming to care about children, let alone children born in poverty, and the sort of women who often need late-term abortions \u2013 this government is no friend to the mentally ill or the suddenly destitute \u2013 and swiftly debunk the science.</p> <p>There is no evidence that late-term abortion traumatises women who have unplanned pregnancies. It traumatises Miller, but that is another thing; Miller the woman can think as she pleases, but Miller the minister has a duty of evidence before she stirs the zeitgeist with a stick. One per cent of foetuses born at 22 weeks survive, it is true, but this is mere sentimentality towards strangers, a kind of moral grandiosity that carries no burden for the moraliser dreaming of fat, luscious babies in cartoonish tableaux. A ban at 20 weeks, however, would traumatise. It is precisely the 20-week scan that shows many disabilities \u2013 how much time will their mothers have to think if Miller has her way?</p> <p>It is unclear what Miller actually proposes should happen to women who are unaware of a pregnancy until 20 weeks, or are in denial. I cannot tell you because Miller's team of civil servants refused to explain her views when I telephoned \u2013 being busy, or at lunch, or on the run. Perhaps she is too traumatised to clarify, to talk about coat hangers and gin baths and how the affluent will always find abortions, and the financially constrained won't? This is not common sense, or anything publishable. It is chaos.</p> <p>I suspect that Miller is pro-life. I suspect that abortion repels this healthy, wealthy, influential woman, and she does not understand why any woman would want an abortion, because she has never needed one. Empathy, as ever, is an abstract to this government, a barrier to its ideological commitment to dismantling the state, and demonising those who need it. Women who are suddenly impoverished or vulnerable or very young \u2013 they are beyond her understanding, and her brief.</p> <p>I suspect that Miller lacks the courage to be publicly pro-life, because she knows that forcing women to have babies they do not want is no less than a kind of life-threatening slavery, and it will not play well with the electorate, who are kinder than their government. It is better, surely, to pick at the edges, to pose as a moderate, a very modern feminist, and make abortion more painful, more scarring and more shameful? It's a thumbs-up for public morality, and public morality is cheap.</p> <p>This is a fragment of a growing assault on birth control. The abortion wars in America, funded by Republicans who want miracle babies but not a functioning welfare state, grow more violent. In these waters, the morning-after pill is an \"abortion pill\"; women seeking abortions should be forced to look at ultrasound scans and describe the foetus; women seeking abortions should be forced to have internal examinations; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/akin-under-pressure-to-quit\" title=\"\">women who are raped don't get pregnant</a>; women who use contraceptives are \"whores\"; abortion providers are \"terrorists\", and so on, and on.</p> <p>This is leaking into Europe. This summer the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/30/anti-abortion-prayer-vigil-noisy-protests\" title=\"\">40 Days For Life group stood in Bedford Square</a>, London, watching women enter an abortion clinic, and approached them with counsel and literature. I saw them standing with placards seeking, it seemed to me, a moral validation from the crises of women they could not know. In Brighton a group called Abort67 stood at an abortion clinic holding pictures of dismembered foetuses; an activist was prosecuted for public order offences, but cleared \u2013 on this, Miller had nothing to say. In Ireland an advertising campaign showed pictures of foetuses split in half. They were hung at airports, or on trains, so women coming to London for abortions, usually alone I suspect, would see them and feel \u2013 what? Baby killer. What else? Fewer&#xa0;than 2% of abortions are after 24&#xa0;weeks. Who cares?</p> <p>If Miller were honest, she would say that the damaging impact abortion has on women largely comes from the views&#xa0;of people like herself. Gay people know this duplicitous narrative well, spouted from the mouths of hypocrites; bigots would tolerate them, were they less unhappy.</p>",

  "<p>Shares in <a href=\"http://zynga.com/\" title=\"\">Zynga</a>, the social gaming company behind Farmville and Mafia Wars, have plunged 20% after it warned of disappointing third quarter earnings and cut its outlook for the year.</p> <p>The company, which is based in San Francisco and the creator of hit games played on Facebook, said it expected to make a net loss of $90m-$105m (\u00a356m-\u00a365m) in the third quarter, blaming delays in new titles and overpaying for another games creator, OMGPOP.</p> <p>It bought the creator of the hit app game Draw Something for a reported $200m in March, only six weeks after the game had been launched, but the studio has failed to replicate its initial success and Zynga wrote down its value by $90m.</p> <p>Much hyped in Silicon Valley before its flotation in December last year, Zynga has since lost three-quarters of its value.</p> <p>It floated at $10 a share, valuing the company at $7bn, but that was already far below earlier predictions of a $20bn valuation. On Friday its shares were trading around $2.34.</p> <p>Since the float it has lost a wave of senior staff, including the chief creative officer, Mike Verdu, security chief Nils Puhlmann, and chief operating officer John Schappert.</p> <p>In the latest round of bad news, Friday's announcement put third quarter bookings, or upfront sales, at around $250m-$255m, down from $302m in the second quarter. In July its shares fell 40% after it reported a loss of $22.8m, saying at the time Facebook had changed its site to favour new games and, as a result, Zynga had lost customers.</p> <p>In a blogpost, Mark Pincus, the mercurial billionaire who is chief executive, claimed good progress with three new games but blamed a weaker outlook for the fourth quarter on \"reduced performance of some live web games\" and \"several new games which are at risk of launching later than expected\".</p> <p>\"Let's not lose sight of the bigger picture. The world is playing games, and is increasingly choosing social games,\" Pincus wrote.</p> <p>In July, the Silicon Valley blogger Henry Blodget reported that Pincus and other senior directors in April had sold stock worth $516m when the company's share price was $12. Four months later, after its second quarter results, Zynga's shares plummeted to $3. Pincus is now among a host of major shareholders at the receiving end of a lawsuit alleging insider trading. Pincus himself reportedly sold 16.5m shares for $200m.</p> <p>Pincus has said the company will push further into gambling and mobile games to try to stem its losses.</p> <p>Industry observers suggest Zynga was unwise to go public with an immature business. The veteran Irish gaming entrepreneur and investor Dylan Collins said: \"The big risk for Zynga is that they take a big strategic move like acquiring one or two very sensible companies and the market doesn't care \u2013 and the share price keeps coming down.\" He suggested Zynga's management may have discussed taking the company private to try to regain financial control of the firm.</p> <p>Zynga's misfortunes have serious implications for Facebook, which at the time of its own public offering derived 12% of its income from the games company. Zynga itself derives around 94% of its revenue from being on Facebook.</p> <p>\"There is change happening at either end of the spectrum for Facebook as a gaming platform, with older users switching to mobile and younger users on different platforms completely,\" said Collins.</p> <p>\"For children under 13, it looks as if tablets are going to be the platform of choice, which probably means ignoring Facebook. And with older users switching to mobile, it means Facebook is a lot less relevant than it used to be.</p> <p>\"From an investor point of view, social gaming is deemed to be dead, anyway.\"</p> <p>Zynga is a famously competitive and high pressure workplace. Employees are reported to be struggling with low morale. Pincus is haunted by a report on the company by San Francisco's SF Weekly in which a former employee claimed that the chief executive actively encouraged copying rival games. \"I don't fucking want innovation,\" the employee recalled him saying. \"You're not smarter than your competitor. Just copy what they do and do it until you get their numbers.\"</p>",
  "<p>The row over the scapegoating of civil servants in the west coast rail franchising fiasco has intensified as one of the three suspended officials hit out at her own department for creating a \"completely inaccurate portrayal\" of her role in the process.</p> <p>Mandarins had been urging staff to face facts and fix the problems in the wake of a crisis that saw the west coast service run by Virgin handed to FirstGroup before the competition was scrapped, leaving the future of Britain's railways in chaos.</p> <p>Philip Rutnam, the permanent secretary, has told staff they must come clean and move on, and accept that the reversal was the fault of officials.</p> <p>However, Kate Mingay, a former Goldman Sachs executive director, spoke out after being identified as one of the suspended officials. She said: \"My role has been inaccurately portrayed, mainly due to statements and other comments made by the Department for Transport itself.</p> <p>\"I would like to make it clear that I did not have lead responsibility for this project; neither I nor any member of my team had any responsibility for the economic modelling for this project, or for any DfT project. Nor did I have any responsibility for the financial modelling in respect of this project.\"</p> <p>A televised interview in which the transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, referred to \"serious errors\" has alarmed lawyers. Mingay is being represented by top law firm Mishcon de Reya.</p> <p>Mingay's statement comes as the DfT embarked on a damage limitation exercise after mistakes that will probably land taxpayers with a bill far in excess of the initial \u00a340m compensation announced for bidding companies.</p> <p>A senior official said of the franchising fiasco: \"It's a big blow, as it is so clearly the responsibility of the officials. And it will take time to rebuild the department's reputation. But this department is not broken. There are so many things we have done well and are doing \u2013 the Olympics, or Crossrail.\"</p> <p>Department chiefs asked the franchising team to check the numbers were correct in the summer, when Richard Branson and Virgin first publicly challenged the DfT's expected decision. The official said: \"We didn't just ignore [Branson] \u2013 we kicked the tyres in July and got back assurances.\"</p> <p>Fresh checks were ordered after an admission of minor procedural errors in late August, after Virgin's legal challenge was mounted. But only on Tuesday did consultants discover that the spreadsheet on which all calculations were modelled was fundamentally flawed. The key mechanism, called the GDP resilience model, mixed up real and inflated financial figures and contained elements of double counting.</p> <p>A separate internal disciplinary procedure will investigate the precise actions of the three suspended staff. According to senior officials, no evidence has been uncovered of anyone acting in bad faith, despite Virgin's fears. Between eight and 10 civil servants were closely involved, as well as hired private consultants.</p> <p>No decision has been reached on who will run the service after 9 December when the current contracts expire.</p> <p>The transport secretary is taking legal advice on options including allowing Virgin to run the service under contract from the department's own arm's-length company, Directly Operated Railways. FirstGroup said the option of legal action was being \"kept under review\".</p>",

As Fehrnstrom famously put it back in March: \"You can kind of shake it up and restart all over again.\"</p> <p>In the first presidential TV debate with President Obama on Wednesday night, and in subsequent media appearances, the former governor of Massachusetts has made several sharp changes in tack that have left seasoned Romney observers flabbergasted. The most dramatic was on Thursday night, when during an interview on Fox News he completely denounced his own notorious comments in a private fundraiser that 47% of the American people were dependent on government.</p> <p>In the firestorm that followed <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser\">Mother Jones's publication of the remarks</a>, Romney tried to stand by them, saying they were correct albeit inelegantly put. But on Thursday night he ditched them entirely, saying: \"In this case, I said something that's just completely wrong.\"</p> <p>The U-turn was in the spirit of his performance in the previous night's presidential debate, in which he displayed similarly breathtaking revisions to policy positions that he has been projecting on the campaign trail for at least 18 months.</p> <p>On tax, having spent the entire Republican primary season trying to convince the fiscally conservative Tea Party that he could be trusted to cut taxes for all Americans including the super-rich, he said: \"I'm not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people [who are] doing just fine.\"</p> <p>Having spent months attacking government red tape for cramping the creativity of the free market, he announced that he now believed that: \"Regulation is essential. You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation.\"</p> <p>And having tub-thumped consistently on the campaign trail against Obamacare, he attempted to embrace the most popular aspects of the Affordable Health Care Act. \"I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions,\" he said, referring to the provision in the legislation that prevents insurance companies rejecting such patients.</p> <p>He even praised his own healthcare reforms in Massachusetts as a \"model for the nation, state by state\". In the past, Romney has tended to avoid talking about his healthcare record as governor because it is seen by many arch conservatives as evidence of his closet liberal tendencies.</p> <p>Obama has been criticised by pundits of both left and right for failing to point out his opponent's nimble footwork on Wednesday night. But he's been trying to make up for the omission in speeches delivered since. At a rally in Fairfax Virginia on Friday morning, Obama accused Romney of \"trying to do a two-step, to have an extreme makeover\".</p> <p>Political observers have reacted to Romney's energetic shift to the centre with surprise; not that he has made the move in itself, but that he has made it so late in the election cycle. The political analyst Larry Sabato said: \"Romney has completely ignored until now Richard Nixon's advice \u2013 go right for the primary season and then scramble back to the middle for the general election. He is only now scrambling back.\"</p> <p>Michael Wissot, a senior strategist with Luntz Global, who advised John McCain in his presidential run against Obama in 2008, said: \"I am very surprised that this strategy has been put into place so late. As governor he had a very strong record of bi-partisanship in Massachusetts where he courted Democrats to achieve results.\"</p> <p>One explanation for the time delay between Fehrnstrom's hailing of Romney the Etch A Sketch six months ago and the emergence of such a candidate just four weeks before election day has been his persistent difficulties with his own Republican base. He has struggled to convince rightwing conservatives who hold sway at many levels of the party that he can be trusted to carry their convictions into the White House should he win on 6 November.</p> <p>But there are signs that following his confident and assertive performance at the first debate, the doubters are finally coming on board. William Kristol, editor of the rightwing Weekly Standard and a long-time critic of Romney, <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/podcast-kristol-reacts-first-presidential-debate_653619.html\">conceded after the debate</a> that there was a need for him to be \"somewhat reassuring about what he would do as president, which is important for independent swing voters who are not 100% behind the conservative agenda\".</p> <p>That other thorn in Romney's side, Rush Limbaugh, gushed that \"this was one of the best debate performances in my life\". Erik Erickson, editor of the blog Red State, tweeted the day after the debate: \"Mitt Romney may be an Etch a Sketch, but it beats the hell out of Obama's whack-a-mole from last night.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's only when you see something truly countercultural that you realise how rare counterculturalism really is. I'm talking about the My Little Pony conference, UK PonyCon. Of course I am. In the East Midlands Novotel, fans of the toy (collectors) have gathered together with male fans of the fourth generation cartoon (\"bronies\" bro+ponies), to appreciate the hell out of these plastic figurines.</p> <p>Collectors have existed since My Little Ponies were invented. Conference organiser Victoria Inman likes to be called Archer. I am OK with that \u2013 she is a pretty typical collector. She started as a kid; when it came to the moment that, by convention, she would have put down her ponies and started playing with nail varnish, she simply\u2026 powered on through.</p> <p>Now 26, she has between 800 and 850 (I think she knows exactly how many she has; it's probably considered vulgar to give the precise number, like it is in reindeer farming communities). On paper, she could not be more conventional; perfect, even features, sunny smile, Hollywood build, except she's wearing some sort of 1980s scouting outfit, with a bright blonde wig. \"I've got three outfits, all from the same pony, I'm going to change for the disco, then change again tomorrow.\"</p> <p>\"What happens at the disco? Do you dance like ponies?\" \"No,\" she scoffs, \"we just dance to cheesy 80s music.\"</p> <p>Maybe that sounds like a stupid question, but later on, they all play a game that involves running sporadically around a room, in which some of them are trying to run like ponies and some aren't. So it can be quite confusing.</p> <p>\"I just like anything that's happy and colourful,\" Siobhan, 25, tells me. Not for the first time, I get the strong impression that they're not saying what they sound as if they're saying. Many of the collectors are art students, or illustrators, or into craft in such an extreme, determined, psychedelic way that it amounts to a sort of anti-domesticity.</p> <p>Sinead, 29, said: \"I'm just incredibly girly. I love baking, I'm really into sewing, I look after children for a living.\" But it's so vaudeville. She's like a girl pretending to be Grayson Perry, pretending to be a girl. The more they say it's about uncomplicated happiness, the more complicated it sounds.</p> <p>\"I see my collection as my pension,\" says Sarah, 28. \"Their value increases so much faster than inflation.\" I want to tell her to check this with Money Box before she's, say, 38. Or maybe have a pension as well. But the world of the collector, any collector, is what it is \u2013 it has its rules and conventions, its values, prizes, scarcities, it always looks curious until you look more closely, then it looks no more (or less) curious than collecting spoons. Bronies are different \u2013 since the start of Friendship and Magic, the revivified fourth season of the MLP cartoon, a legion of male fans has built up. They sometimes wear My Little Pony tiaras, or carry a \"plushy\" (a blanket with a pony's head), but they don't collect in earnest. When you ask them what else they're into, they either say \"World of Warcraft\" or \"Not World of Warcraft\".</p> <p>Cameron Stalker (apparently, yes) is 27, and came with his friend, James Slater, 30. They've been friends for years but only bronies since 2011.</p> <p>\"The show itself has a huge following, it's like a subculture. The creator [Lauren Faust] didn't like the way girls cartoons talked down to girls; she's wanted to do something with a storyline and a structure. It's surprisingly addictive. Any brony you ask will tell you that they would never have believed they'd like it.\" Phillip, 22, had told me earlier: \"You see all these hits on YouTube, and it gets to the point where you wonder why other people are enjoying it so much. So you just have a look, and immediately, you're a brony. It's like a virus.\"</p> <p>Returning to Stalker and Slater, I asked whether they were deliberately trying to subvert preconceptions about masculinity by getting into a cartoon about ponies, or whether their gender identity just didn't come into their cartoon choices. \"It depends how you perceive it,\" Slater said.</p> <p>\"If more men are liking it than women, technically, it's masculine.</p> <p>\"In a way, it's a confidence issue. I can wear a My Little Pony tiara and not be embarrassed about it because it's what I like. But it is completely genuine for me. My love for the show is because of the show.\"</p>",
  "<p>The new culture secretary, Maria Miller, has had a meteoric rise. In terms of departmental influence, Miller is now the second most senior woman in the cabinet behind the home secretary, Theresa May. She not only succeeds Jeremy Hunt at culture, she is also minister for equalities, a responsibility she has taken on from the pressurised May.</p> <p>The Conservatives' need to appeal to women voters has hardly been a secret. The party's own pollsters, Populus, showed a 28-point Labour lead (53 to 25) among women in September, as opposed to a 10-point (40 to 30) lead among men.</p> <p>Many Labour politicians have claimed one reason for this is because women are disproportionately hit by spending cuts. But Miller, in her first interview about her wide-ranging brief, argued that women understood the need to cut the deficit.</p> <p>Speaking in her Commons office on Friday, she said: \"When you look at what we have been doing for the last two and a half years, so much of it does resonate with women.</p> <p>\"If you look at what we have done in terms of focusing on cutting the deficit, welfare reform and tax reforms \u2013 lifting two million of the lowest-paid people out of tax altogether disproportionately supports women, who can often have part-time jobs.\"</p> <p>Women, she said, were more interested in their children getting a good job and education, \"and there is no way you are going to achieve these things if you have a government that is saddled with record levels of debt\".</p> <p>She would not say if she supported tax breaks for married couples, arguing it was a matter for the chancellor, but added that she believed in a stable family life.</p> <p>She does not preach that marriage is inherently superior to other stable relationships. \"The important thing is creating stability in a way that is most appropriate for families \u2013 that is why we are talking about reform of civil marriage so it is available to more people, but it is also about creating stable environments.\"</p> <p>On abortion, she said she felt \"very strongly\" that it was right to lower the legal limit at which a pregnancy could be terminated from 24 weeks to 20. \"My voting record speaks for itself,\" she said, but adding that it was an issue of conscience and would be a free vote in the Commons if it came to it, without a party line.</p> <p>There is a sense of nervousness in the Tory party that the abortion issue could spiral out of control. Hunt, now health secretary, has voted for a 12-week limit, and Miller clearly does not want to escalate the issue.</p> <p>The monster controversy facing her in the next month will be the government's response to the Leveson inquiry into the future of press regulation. But she is firm that there has to be reform, balanced by freedom of speech.</p> <p>\"I think what has happened touched the nerve of the nation and we have got to have something that deals with it. Some things that happened were already breaches of the law.\"</p> <p>She said her test, as well as No &#xa0;10's, would be whether the government, media and Lord Leveson found a solution that would allow politicians to look the family of murder victim Milly Dowler in the eye and say such intrusion into their privacy would not happen again. She insisted she was not involved in any behind-the-scenes talks between newspaper proprietors to broker a deal. \"It is not really the moment for that,\" she said.</p> <p>Some Tory MPs such as John Whittingdale, chairman of the culture select committee, have criticised Leveson for looking at issues such as the Sun's Page &#xa0;3 pin-ups. Asked if she thought topless pictures degraded women, a cause recently reignited by the <a href=\"http://www.change.org/en-GB/petitions/dominic-mohan-take-the-bare-boobs-out-of-the-sun-nomorepage3\" title=\"\">nomorepage3 petition</a>, she sidestepped. \"It is for newspapers to decide what they print and it is for consumers to decide what they buy.</p> <p>\"That is the way it should be, and I don't think it is right for ministers to dictate what goes on any page of a newspaper, whether it is page 3 or not.\"</p> <p>Pressed on whether she personally regarded such pictures as degrading or just some innocent fun, Miller sidestepped the question again. She said: \"\"On a broader issue, I think it is vital that women are given the confidence to realise they have an important role in society,\" adding: \"I have an 18-year-old daughter and there are lots of pressures on young women to conform to a stereotype \u2026 But in terms of the way the media chooses to portray things, that is for the media to ask themselves the question. Everyone has a responsibility to make sure they are good operators in society.\"</p> <p>Before becoming an MP, Miller had spells in the advertising industry (two stints at Grey, 1985-90 and 1994-99), marketing (at Texaco between her two Grey spells) and public relations (The Rowland Company, 1999-2003). Her clients included Procter &amp; Gamble and Mars.</p> <p>Some have suggested her professional background would draw her to the regulatory model in the advertising industry as a route for newspapers to follow, essentially a system of self-regulation within a statutory framework.</p> <p>If she is cautious on Leveson, she is clearly a friend of the BBC, and the licence fee, describing the BBC as one of \"the great iconic brands of Britain. They have lots of challenges with the digital world, but their use of digital TV around the Olympics has really carved them out as a leader.\"</p> <p>Asked about her interest in the arts, she said it was shaped by her three children. She went to the Young Vic with her daughter to see Three Sisters (\"absolutely amazing\") and the Damien Hirst show with her two sons (\"the butterfly room challenged their senses of what art is\").</p> <p>She promises, on the back of the Olympics, to do more to promote women's sport and is trying to secure the Olympic legacy, setting up a database of all the volunteers who worked on the Olympics and seeing if they can be matched with the need for sports volunteers in schools and clubs.</p> <p>\"The Olympics gave us a great sense of being British, but it just has to be the start,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>Chris Waddle's criticism of Joey Barton's loan move to Marseille was unusual: unconventionally bold, in the civil service sense employed by Sir Humphrey Appleby as a euphemism for foolhardy, and because it is rare for a player to adopt such proprietorial tones about a former&#xa0;club.</p> <p>Those who question Barton \u2013 Gary Lineker for instance \u2013 tend to be repaid with a rapid raising of the stakes, an arms race of insults that too quickly escalates towards flirting with mutually assured destruction. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/04/chris-waddle-joey-barton-marseille\" title=\"\">By saying: \"Unless someone's built him up into being Zinedine Zidane, I don't know how he got that move,\"</a> Waddle risks retaliation. The game's Twitter Pied Piper normally does not let such slights go unpunished.</p> <p>But Waddle is not being as reckless as he seems. Unlike most critics he carries a shield. The enduring affection of Marseille supporters for the Gateshead-born winger makes it unwise for Barton to respond in kind for fear of alienating his new home crowd. \"It's a fantastic club with fanatical support and if he upsets the supporters he might as well leave town,\" Waddle said in a one-two combination, the implicit threat backing up the earlier observation.</p> <p>The prospect of Barton enjoying success and adulation to match Waddle's three-year triumph at the Stade V\u00e9lodrome is implausible but one emotion they share that started their careers there is the feeling of relief to have escaped English football, the former QPR captain desiring a new start, Waddle from what he perceived as tactical drudgery.</p> <p>A year after leaving Tottenham as the then third-most expensive signing in history Waddle joined up with England's 1990 World Cup squad as a French title winner and spoke about the difference between the playing styles in the two countries. \"In France I'm an attacker,\" he told Pete Davies in All Played Out. \"Here I'm running up and down, up and down, defend, attack, defend, attack \u2013 I'm shattered.\"</p> <p>There had been doubts in the summer of 1989 concerning whether he was worth the \u00a34.25m Marseille paid for him and some derision about a Geordie acclimatising to life in the south of France which was, back then, still seen as the acme of continental sophistication, all Brigitte Bardot, C\u00e9zanne and Eric and Ernie in That Riviera Touch.</p> <p>Here Waddle tended to suffer by comparison with his good friend and former team-mate Glenn Hoddle. The latter was the personification of urbanity as a player, directing games at his best as though he were draped in ermine-trimmed robes with a viscount's coronet balanced jauntily on his blow wave. And yet as we were later to discover it was deceptive. An early indication came when the Diamond Lights duo were interviewed live after both scored in Spurs' 2-0 FA Cup quarter-final victory over Wimbledon in 1987. Asked to describe his glorious 30-yard free-kick, Hoddle said: \"I just twatted it.\" Waddle, standing next to him, cringed at the profanity his friend had just broadcast to the nation.</p> <p>After a difficult spell settling in when he played up to the stereotype of the ingenue abroad by telling reporters that he used his hotel suite's bidet to wash his boots, Waddle blossomed alongside Jean-Pierre Papin and Enzo Francescoli, winning the first of three successive league titles and getting to the semi-finals of the European Cup. Papin, who had spent a year at Brugge and struggled to establish a rapport with the club's Flemish speakers, took Waddle under his wing, influencing his 'Allo 'Allo! approach to English in interviews for a British audience and Papin adopting Geordie pronunciations for words such as Wembley and February in return.</p> <p>Waddle, living in Aix-en-Provence, became an adopted Frenchman, never more so than when Graham Taylor refused to pick him for England and he became a kind of prophet in exile for a different philosophy. He had worked at winning over the Marseille public with the same diligence he had once applied to transforming himself from a one-footed, orthodox, left-winger into a two-footed attacker. He did this by entertaining the crowd with comical facial expressions, celebrations and stunts such as borrowing a mobile phone from a steward before taking a corner. To his team-mates he was <em>Le&#xa0;Magicien</em> while L'Equipe called him <em>Le Dribbleur Fou</em> and when Francescoli left after one season Waddle, in tandem with Abedi Pele behind Papin, became more expansive still.</p> <p>The winger without blistering pace requires a peculiar style of nerve to complement his skill. As a magician Waddle had stealth; defenders knew what he was going to do \u2013 like the victim of a short con shell game \u2013 but could do very little to prevent him bamboozling them with a shoulder swerve or a hip shimmy with the ball always under his immaculate control.</p> <p>He left Marseille as one of Britain's best three exports alongside John Charles and Kevin Keegan and by the time he returned to Sheffield Wednesday in 1992, to win the Footballer of the Year in his first season back, he was thoroughly uninhibited. France had liberated him and turned him into a player with the courage of his convictions.</p> <p>\"If he plays well, they'll take to him,\" Waddle said of Barton as a consolation after the scepticism. If he has a quarter of the impact of \"Merlin\" they certainly will.</p>",
  "<p>Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has survived many crises during his seven years in office, both at home and abroad. But fears over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/03/iran-currency-crisis-tehran-clashes\" title=\"\">country's crumbling economy</a>, which have exposed the extent of internal divisions at the top of the Islamic republic, could signal the beginning of the end.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad has been left increasingly marginalised as the country's currency has plummeted, with analysts speculating that he is being used by his former allies as a scapegoat for the regime's problems.</p> <p>With the rial reaching an all-time low this week, Ahmadinejad has been roundly rebuffed by his opponents, who blame his government for mismanagement and economic incompetence. The currency has lost a third of its value in a week, with the dollar now three times stronger against it than early last year.</p> <p>At a press conference in Tehran this week, Ahmadinejad made a speech which highlighted the power struggle between his supporters and his conservative rivals in the parliament and the judiciary.</p> <p>The president defended his economic policies and blamed the plummeting value of the rial both on western sanctions and a \"propaganda campaign\" perpetrated by his opponents at home.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad's words widened the internal rift, prompting many of his parliamentary rivals \u2013 who form an overwhelming majority \u2013 to launch the strongest attack on him by regime insiders so far.</p> <p>Abbas Rajaei, an MP for the central city of Arak, accused the president of \"lying vividly to the people\", and Kamalodin Pirmoazen, another parliamentarian, said he was inciting discontent among Iranians towards their officials. The influential MP Ali Motahari, an outspoken critic of Ahmadinejad, has also recently said that the president should not remain in presidential office \"even for another single day\".</p> <p>These remarks echoed what the Iranian opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, both currently under house arrest, said in 2009 when Ahmadinejad took office for a second term amid unrest and allegations of fraud.</p> <p>They are the latest signs that Ahmadinejad, who has suffered a series of setbacks in his ongoing feud with the conservatives, has lost a great deal of his influence in the country \u2013 although he is still able to grab headlines abroad. Last week, while he was addressing the UN general assembly, his media adviser, Ali Akbar Javanfekr, was taken to Tehran's Evin prison. Ahmadinejad suggested this week that he wanted to inspect the prison, but authorities signalled that he would not be welcome.</p> <p>It did not help that Tehran's Grand Bazaar, the heartbeat of the capital's economy, also went on strike and hundreds of protesters took to the streets, chanting anti-government slogans that described the president as a traitor\". Iranian state TV, which rarely reflects public anger about the regime, reported the closure of the bazaar and the discontent about the devaluation of currency. Analysts saw it as a sign that pressure is mounting on the president.</p> <p>Sadegh Zibakalam, a professor of political science at Tehran University, said Ahmadinejad was increasingly becoming a \"lame duck\". Zibakalam said Ahmadinejad was being used as a scapegoat by many of the same people who were his supporters in the past.</p> <p>\"Ahmadinejad's economic policies are not new. They have been in place from the beginning. If there's a failure, it's not limited to Ahmadinejad. The leadership of fundamentalists should be held responsible too.\"</p> <p>Fundamentalists, who are believed to be close to the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have accused Ahmadinejad and his allies, including his controversial chief of staff, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, of attempting to undermine clerical power and advocating nationalism and greater cultural openness.</p> <p>\"Ahmadinejad and Mashaei don't think they need to obey clerical power. They both have not been loyal enough to the supreme leader,\" said Zibakalam. He predicted that Ahmadinejad, who cannot run for a third time under Iranian law, would not be able to ensure the election of one of his allies in the 2013 vote.</p> <p>Hamid Dabashi, a professor of Iranian studies at Columbia University, said that some of the slogans used by protesters this week showed that the crisis was \"much more deep-rooted\" and had wider political implications.</p> <p>\"Now the endemic factionalism [in Iran] will try to ride on this crisis, as the Islamic Republic is gearing up for the next presidential election. The conservatives will happily blame Ahmadinejad for everything,\" he said. \"And if [the former president Mohammad] Khatami plays his historic role of warming up the otherwise depleted political energy of the Islamic Republic, they may actually manage to regenerate some political legitimacy for the ruling regime.\"</p>",
  "<p>India's main share index plunged 16% within minutes on Friday in a so-called \"flash crash\" \u2013 the latest in a series of market glitches that have shaken confidence in global financial markets.</p> <p>India's National Stock Exchange (NSE) was forced to halt trading for 15 minutes, after a brokerage placed 59 wrong orders, triggering a sell-off that wiped nearly $60bn off the value of the country's biggest companies.</p> <p>The orders were cancelled and stocks recovered, with India's Nifty index closing down 0.8% on the day. But the event will concentrate the minds of regulators concerned about the impact of trading technology on the stability of markets.</p> <p>This year has seen a series of trading errors that have damaged the credibility of exchanges and rocked investors' faith in financial markets. Last week Nasdaq was forced to cancel trading in Kraft, after a market glitch caused the share price to soar by nearly 30%. That brought back memories of the botched Facebook flotation, when Nasdaq's system crashed under the weight of demand for the stock. Earlier this year, US broker Knight Capital ran up a $440m loss in 45 minutes after a bug in the automation process generated thousands of mistaken orders for stocks.</p> <p>Joseph Saluzzi, co-founder of US agency broker Themis Trading, said: \"We look at it as minor earthquakes and what they build up to is one much bigger earthquake, which could be an entire global market breakdown.\"</p> <p>The NSE blamed Friday's crash on human error but Saluzzi said that was highly unlikely. \"There is no human being in the world that can take down the stock market by 16%. This is typical spin.\"</p> <p>He said any error was probably exacerbated by high-frequency trading, which involves using software to post orders for microseconds at a time to exploit tiny differences in share prices.</p> <p>It is now widely accepted that high-frequency trading fuelled the flash crash of May 2010, which saw the Dow Jones industrial average plunge by 998 points in 20 minutes, raising fears of a worldwide stock market collapse.</p> <p>Concern about high-frequency trading has increased in recent months, with European legislators moving to limit the practice. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/26/eu-group-votes-high-frequency-trades?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">The European Parliament voted last month</a> to force trading venues to slow the speed with which orders can be made. Under the proposed law, share orders would have to be posted for at least a half-second, far longer than high-frequency traders now stay in the market. The German government has also approved a draft bill aimed at reining in the practice.</p>",
  "<p>Greece is teetering on the edge of collapse with its society at risk of disintegrating unless the country's near-empty public coffers are shored up with urgent financial aid, the country's prime minister has warned.</p> <p>Almost three years after the eruption of Europe's debt drama in Athens, the economic crisis engulfing the nation has become so severe that democracy itself is now imperiled, Antonis Samaras said.</p> <p>\"Greek democracy stands before what is perhaps its greatest challenge,\" Samaras told the German business daily Handelsblatt in an interview published hours before the announcement in Berlin that Angela Merkel will fly to Athens next week for the first time since the outbreak of the crisis.</p> <p>Resorting to highly unusual language for a man who weighs his words carefully, the 61-year-old politician evoked the rise of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party to highlight the threat that Greece faces, explaining that society \"is threatened by growing unemployment, as happened to Germany at the end of the Weimar Republic\".</p> <p>\"Citizens know that this government is Greece's last chance,\" said Samaras, who has repeatedly appealed for international lenders at the EU and IMF to relax the onerous conditions of the bailout accords propping up the Greek economy.</p> <p>Mounting anti-austerity rage before a new round of sweeping EU-IMF-mandated austerity measures appears to have caught the government off-guard, with officials voicing fears over the ability of Samaras's fragile coalition to survive.</p> <p>The unprecedented storming of Greece's defence ministry by hundreds of protesting dockworkers on Thursday \u2013 a breach of security not seen in modern times \u2013 has especially unnerved officials. On Friday, Samaras lashed out at \"those who don't understand the meaning of law and order\".</p> <p>\"The government is waging a battle on all fronts for the nation's credibility and its future so that the sacrifices made by Greeks aren't lost,\" he said, referring to the spending cuts and tax increases that have sparked record levels of poverty and unemployment. \"I will not allow the country to become a free-for-all.\"</p> <p>Many officials fear the conservative-led alliance is being pushed too far in negotiations that have dragged on for weeks over the latest \u20ac13.5bn package of austerity measures that is the price of further aid. Growing speculation that Greece will be kept waiting until after the US elections in November before it receives its next disbursement of aid has added to the pressure. On Friday EU officials made clear it was highly unlikely a decision would be made on the payment \u2013 vital to kickstarting the cash-starved economy \u2013 at an upcoming EU summit on 18 October. The Athens government is also appealing for a two-year extension of the debt-choked country's fiscal adjustment programme in an effort to ameliorate the impact of further punishing austerity.</p> <p>In the interview Samaras emphasised that Greek cash reserves would run dry by the end of November. \"The key is liquidity,\" said the leader. \"That is why the next credit tranche is so important for us.\"</p> <p>The high-wire act of placating international lenders while keeping social unrest at bay will be tested as never before when Merkel, the German chancellor, flies into Athens next Tuesday. With anti-EU sentiment at an all-time high, opposition parties and trade unions vowed a baptism of fire.</p> <p>\"She should expect demonstrations. Greek society will welcome her with mass protests,\" said Panos Skourletis, a spokesman for the radical left main opposition Syriza party.</p> <p>The Independent Greeks party, also vehemently anti-bailout, has said it will make war reparations a major part of its own protest when it stages a \"symbolic blockade\" outside the German embassy in Athens during Merkel's visit.</p>",
  "<p>All week the townspeople of Machynlleth have believed that there could be a happy resolution, that April Jones would be returned to her mum and dad safe and well.</p> <p>And on Friday still \u2013 even after the police announced that Mark Bridger was being treated as a murder suspect and said it was no longer appropriate for non-professionals to go out searching \u2013 the town refused to give up hope.</p> <p>\"We believe that she could be out there somewhere alive,\" said Kirsty Jones, 16, a friend of April's sister, Jasmine, as she handed out the pink ribbons that April's family have asked people to wear to show they still had faith that the girl could be found.</p> <p>By Friday night there was hardly a single person to be seen on the high street not wearing a splash of pink. \"People still have hope,\" said Kirsty.</p> <p>The moment when the news broke in Machynlleth that the status of the investigation had changed was a dreadful one. Some were watching the police press conference \u2013 held 18 miles up the road in Aberystwyth \u2013 on big screens at the town's leisure centre, which has become the meeting place for the searchers.</p> <p>Volunteers who had gathered in readiness to go back out into the fields and valleys to help search for the five-year-old girl were then asked to meet at the Y Plas Machynlleth, a community centre and hall. They had to wait for 20 terrible minutes, not speaking, not really looking at each other, until a police officer arrived to spell out the situation.</p> <p>Carl Jones, from Machynlleth, who has helped co-ordinate volunteer searches all week, said police explained that they were now searching for a body. \"We're trying to work out what to do next,\" he said. \"I don't think we've all grasped the implications of what the police have said yet.\"</p> <p>What some people did was defy the police and carry on searching. \"We've got teams out there. We continue to hope,\" said Jones.</p> <p>The dignity and resolve of the townspeople was illustrated by two women who learned the grim news when Kay Burley divulged it to them live on Sky News.</p> <p>One apologised for sobbing and as she walked away paused to check Burley had a pink ribbon. \"Keep hope alive,\" she said.</p> <p>Precisely the same message came from the church and school.</p> <p>The Rev Kathleen Rogers, of St Peter's church, was at the leisure centre to offer words of consolation to the townsfolk. \"This child has not been found, we still have hope,\" she said.</p> <p>At April's school, the gates were swathed in a giant pink ribbon. Inside the pupils had created a special, quiet area in the foyer and written messages of love to April.</p> <p>Headteacher Gwenfair Glyn said the days since the girl had vanished had been an \"emotional roller-coaster\".</p> <p>\"This week has been the hardest in the school's history,\" she said. \"But everyone has rallied around and provided tremendous support. We refuse to give up hope and are praying that April is still alive.\"</p> <p>Back at the leisure centre the police-led search continued. Here the message was that nothing had changed. \"It's the same as yesterday and the day before,\" said Mark Moran, from the charity Mountain Rescue, \"We are searching for a little girl.\"</p> <p>He said it was irrelevant whether they were looking for someone who was dead or alive and morale had not been affected by the police's announcement.</p> <p>\"If anything it makes us more determined. That mother wants her daughter back. That's still the aim.\"</p>",

But in the dance world, South Korean hip-hop has been a serious force for years. The b-boying craze took root back in the 1990s, partly among disaffected teens and young men facing military conscription, but by 2002 the country was producing world-class crews like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DquVBxkUl_c\" title=\"\">Visual Shock</a> and the government was actively promoting the dance as a key element of South Korean life \u2013 sponsoring the nation's own annual, World Battle competition and highlighting the distinctively Korean flavour that some of the best of the dancers had introduced into the form.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DquVBxkUl_c?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DquVBxkUl_c\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DquVBxkUl_c\">Reading this on a mobile?

Its music is a hip-hop remix of <a href=\"http://www.pachelbelcanon.com/\" title=\"\">Pachelbel's Canon</a>, juxtaposing beat boxing and traditional Korean zither: and at moments like [1.17] the dancer it works with the music to build up a looping intensifying dynamic of movement, or to concentrate a quality of stillness [1.42] that's in fascinating tension with the more traditional hard energy of the b-boy vocabulary.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V8qhYq7VNXw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V8qhYq7VNXw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qhYq7VNXw\">Reading this on a mobile?

But the rest requires multiple viewings just to figure out what these fabulous dancers are doing. The choppy hip-hop footwork becomes something else [1.27-38], so light and fast it seems to float. The one-handed balances and head stands [2.58-3.08] have an equivalent quality of suspension. The dancers seem as if they have all the time in the world, and to be breathing a different air as they move. As for the one-handed spin at 2.48, even when I watch it frame by frame I can't see exactly how it's done.</p> <p>This is hip-hop as both ballet and T'ai chi. But also as itself. Has there been any other form in the history of dance to have travelled so far and fast around the world, and to have absorbed so many different colours and styles en route?</p>",
  "<p>Germany is poised to introduce a law that will allow parents to choose whether their sons are circumcised.</p> <p>The move is an attempt to appease the Jewish and Muslim communities angered by a court ruling in June that in effect outlawed the practice.</p> <p>The cabinet is expected to adopt the bill next week to clarify the law after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/27/circumcision-ruling-germany-muslim-jewish\" title=\"\">court in Cologne ruled that carrying out the religious tradition on boys was tantamount to bodily harm</a>.</p> <p>\"It is a clear political signal that Jews and Muslims continue to be welcome in Germany,\" said Dieter Graumann, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany in a statement. \"We are glad that Jewish laws, and with it Jewish life, will not be deemed illegal \u2013 legal certainty in this case means safeguarding the future of Judaism in Germany.\"</p> <p>The draft of the bill allows circumcision to be carried out on boys up to six months old by a doctor or someone as \"skilled as a doctor\".</p> <p>Although the religious practice is also carried out by many Muslims, the row has largely centred on the Jewish community, which has been angered by the debate.</p> <p>\"Why should people say how I should live my religion?\" said Walter Rothschild, chief rabbi of the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein, adding that he did not blame the government. \"Politicians didn't want this fight,\" he added. \"It was the last thing they wanted.\"</p> <p>Members of the Jewish community said the debate had made many feel unwelcome in Germany, which has been exacerbated by recent attacks on prominent Jews in past weeks.</p> <p>Although the federal ministry of justice was not able to confirm when the bill would be adopted, a spokesman said it was likely to be on Wednesday, with the first reading due to take place in parliament in November.</p>",
  "<p>Scandal! Well-educated person with a high level of relevant skills gets top job! Such an exclamation may seem a tad odd, but in a topsy-turvy world it seems to have a perverse logic, which is currently used to deride the prime minister and others in public life. If someone has the benefit, indeed privilege, of a good education, it seems necessarily to follow that he or she is somehow unworthy and, in any event, clearly knows nothing about \"real life\".</p> <p>Any good school, comprehensive, academy or independent, confers advantage on its students. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/01/ed-miliband-speech-education-vow?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband, who spoke at length about Haverstock, his own comprehensive,</a> this week, would surely accept this. The issue is the use to which the advantage is put. A good school will want young people to develop the self-confidence that enables them to stand up for themselves, and the desire and ability to stand for a purpose higher than themselves. In so doing they can be of value to society, prepared to roll up their sleeves and get things done rather than witter on the sidelines.</p> <p>Some will point the finger and say a school like <a href=\"http://www.etoncollege.com/\" title=\"\">Eton</a> is an ivory tower, a mythical place on the margins of society, a repository of social stereotypes with uniform views, as relevant to \"real life\" as life on Mars. If any of that were true of Eton, it is 50 years out of date. Like the best of schools, Eton celebrates difference: different characters and skills, different ethnic, religious and social backgrounds. As one 17-year-old put it: \"However different you may feel, you will find another boy here who shares your difference.\" Whatever may be said about Eton, it is not a school for clones.</p> <p>Neither is it a cosy brotherhood living in cloistered seclusion. Whether running a joint debating group or volunteering to be an academic mentor in a neighbouring school or in a host of other ways, boys are part of the world around them. Programmes of speakers organised by boys and shared with local schools encourage a healthily sceptical, alert awareness of a wide range of contemporary issues. The Eton I live and work in is a busy, lively, challenging, stimulating place.</p> <p>And yet there is this other Eton, the \"Eton\" that is a lazy shorthand for all the social ills under the sun. Never let reality stand in the way of a good headline. That there are teenage boys who intelligently question the assumptions of past generations and who care about serious matters bodes well for our future. That there are men of ability and determination who choose to channel their ambition into a willingness to serve the public good should be a cause of celebration. I am proud when Old Etonians step forward in the public arena, because they have something worthwhile to give and they should do so. Where they have been is history: it's what they do and where they are going that counts.</p> <p>In times past, great educators have spoken without compunction about the virtues of discrimination \u2013 not the loaded modern use of the word bespeaking one-upmanship and prejudice, but discrimination as a discipline of the intellect and character. Good education should develop a finely tuned ability to discriminate between the flabby and precise, between the superficial and substantial, between a fake and the real thing. A great education encourages discrimination between the good and the bad, integrity and pretence, truth and a lie. This is the education I would wish for us all, especially for those in public life.</p> <p>This approach does not sit altogether comfortably in our age of obsessive measurement, but it should be the right of every young person, whatever their background. It is an approach that touches on timeless attributes: the qualities of courage, of respect, of seeing the world as an interconnected whole. At heart education is a simple thing. Wherever they may be, young people need to experience the joy of achievement, their own and others', and to value and esteem their fellows \u2013 and they need great teachers. In the end, all the rest \u2013 the systems, structures, protocols and defined outcomes \u2013 is, like political posturing, just so much noise.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Tesco</strong> fell to a two month low in a rising market, as investors checked out of the supermarket group's shares in the wake of its first profit fall for twenty years.</p> <p>The company reported half year figures on Wednesday showing trading profits dropped 10.5% to \u00a31.6bn, prompting concerns about its poor UK performance and growing problems in its international business. It closed down 2.8p at 315.35p, its worst level since the start of August as analysts queued up to downgrade the business. Kate Calvert and Freddie George at Seymour Pierce said:</p> <blockquote> The market was prepared for a decline in profits from Tesco, but we believe its first half results were disappointing even in that context. We have reappraised our forecast and cut 2013 and 2014 [earnings] by 8% and 14% respectively. With no visibility on where UK profitability will bottom and too many of its overseas businesses face trading issues shorter term, we reiterate our reduce recommendation and cut our target price to 290p from 310p. </blockquote> <p>Caroline Gulliver at Espirito Santo said:</p> <blockquote> The deteriorating outlook for Tesco's international business, for both structural and cyclical growth, leads us to cut our group pretax profit estimates by 10% for 2013 and 16% for 2014. We believe Tesco is in transition and may well emerge a well-run, mature retailer with operating margins of over 5% and a cashflow yield above 10%. At which point we would see value in the shares up to 380p. But we are not there yet and with several obstacles on the path we cut our fair value by 10% to 300p and keep our neutral rating. </blockquote> <p>Overall the market end the week on a positive note, boosted by better than expected US jobs figures, with the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finishing 43.24 points higher at 5871.02. Despite continuing concerns about the eurozone crisis - with the problems in Spain, Greece and Portugal far from resolved - the leading index added nearly 130 points over the course of the week.</p> <p>Commodity companies were among the main gainers after the US data suggested brighter prospects for the global economy. <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> led the way, up 18.6p to 333.3p. Analysts at Credit Suisse said:</p> <blockquote> With the strong pick-up in nickel prices (lead indicator for stainless demand), rising stainless prices in Europe and potential supply risk in South Africa (strike risk spreading) we expect the fourth quarter to be a trough for prices and, given very weak recent performance, ENRC shares could see improved momentum near term. </blockquote> <p>Fellow Kazakh miner <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> climbed 31.5p to 738p, while <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> rose 36p to \u00a311.01. <strong>Evraz</strong>, the Russian steelmaker controlled by Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, recovered from a fall on Thursday in the wake of news it was taking a majority stake in coal miner Raspadskaya. Its shares ended 9p to 254.1p. In a hold note, analysts at Societe Generale said:</p> <blockquote> The deal is somewhat unexpected but is the logical conclusion to a prolonged saga of love and resistance as Evraz made unsuccessful takeover attempts before. The valuation looks pricey but we expect limited impact on the share price. </blockquote> <p>But engineering and design firm <strong>WS Atkins</strong> fell nearly 5%, down 34p to 695p after reports its role in the West Coast franchise fiasco was being investigated. The franchise was taken away from the winner, <strong>FirstGroup</strong>, after irregularities in the bidding process. Atkins - along with law firm Eversheds - had reportedly been hired in January to give technical advice on the franchise process. David Brockton at Espirito Santo said:</p> <blockquote> Should any review find Atkins to have been at fault during this tender process, then clearly it could have a negative reputational impact for the group, given this represents a high profile tender. <br> </blockquote> <p>Andy Brown at Panmure Gordon added:</p> <blockquote> [The report] is unlikely to be helpful for the share price in the short term. That said, Atkins has strong rail expertise so we expect it to continue to play an active role in a strategically important infrastructure sector over the medium term. <br> Previously it suffered from negative sentiment surrounding its involvement in Metronet [the Tube consortium] but that did not stop it winning future government related work. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile FirstGroup fell 4.5p to 196.1p having lost 20% on the day the franchise was withdrawn.</p> <p>Elsewhere energy services business <strong>Wood Group</strong> added 22.5p to 833.5p after an upbeat trading statement, with the company saying it was confident of meeting full year expectations. The engineering division continues to perform well, with a number of contracts in the Gulf of Mexico, and it confirmed its contract problems in Oman would lead to a $15m-$20m loss from its business there.</p> <p>Keith Morris at Investec kept his hold rating an 800p price target:</p> <blockquote> Today's statement does not highlight any significant changes to the 2012 outlook since the Interims at the end of August. With a rating in line with its large cap peers, we see no specific catalysts for outperformance. </blockquote> <p><strong>Kingfisher</strong> climbed 1.6p to 270.3p despite Morgan Stanley downgrading the DIY chain from overweight to equal-weight. It said the retailer's shares had been weighed down by concerns about its French business, but investors should possibly be more worried about B&amp;Q in the UK:</p> <blockquote> B&amp;Q has delivered just five quarters of positive like for like growth in the last 7.5 years. Gross margin improvements and cost savings have mitigated the top-line weakness thus far, but with first half profits down 24%, we fear that 'self help' may no longer be enough to sustain the chain's recovery. </blockquote> <p><strong>AstraZeneca</strong> added 7.5p to 2918.5p, as traders suggested Monday's decision by new chief executive Pascal Soriot to halt its share buyback programme could mean it was on the takeover trail. US group Forest Laboratories was one name mentioned as a possible target.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps, the biggest loser was <strong>Kcom</strong>. The telecoms group fell 5.6p to 78.75p after reporting lower than expected growth in its business and public sector markets.</p> <p><strong>Mitchells &amp; Butlers</strong> rose 5.6p to 306.6p after this week's news that horseracing tycoons JP McManus and John Magnier had bought 7m shares in the pubs group through their Elpida vehicle, taking their stake to 22.47%. Joe Lewis, the billionaire currency trader, owns 26.3% and saw two bids for the business rejected last year. Shareholders have been unhappy about the dominance of the major shareholders, with no independent directors on the board.</p> <p>In a buy note Nick Batram at Peel Hunt moved from hold to buy. He said:</p> <blockquote> Few would argue that M&amp;B has not got a high quality estate, but extracting the full potential from its assets has proved frustratingly difficult. This has been further compounded by the boardroom sideshow played out over the past few years. However, we believe that a platform (built on management stability and culture change) is now in place to finally deliver the potential that M&amp;B has long held. </blockquote> <p>Finally <strong>Pursuit Dynamics</strong> lost a quarter of its value, down 2.05p to 6.075p after the company said it was seeking new funding as it awaited firm orders for its process technology equipment. It hopes to provide an update by the end of the month. In March this year the company raised \u00a39.4m with a rights issue, eight months after an \u00a38m placing. It said:</p> <blockquote> [The company] has a growing pipeline of quotations and prospects in its public health &amp; safety and brewing, food &amp; beverage businesses, a number of which the board believes will be converted into orders in due course but their timing is such that they will not eliminate the need for additional funding. </blockquote>",
  "<p>Let me hazard a wild guess: the system of passwords you use on the internet \u2013 for accessing online banking, email, shopping sites, Twitter and Facebook accounts \u2013 is a&#xa0;mess. You know perfectly well what you <em>ought</em> to be doing: for each site you visit, you should be choosing a&#xa0;different, complex sequence of letters, numbers and symbols, and then memorising it. (That's rule number one of the conventional wisdom on passwords: never, ever write them down.) But you don't do this, because you weren't blessed with a brain that's capable of such feats. So instead you use the same familiar words for every site \u2013 your dog's name, the name of your street \u2013 with occasional ingenious permutations, such as adding \"123\" at the end. Or maybe you do try to follow the rules, in which case you're probably constantly getting locked out of your bank account or trying to remember the answers to various absurd security questions. (\"What was your favourite sport as a child?\" I'm now asked, though my real favourite sport was finding ways to dodge PE. One question at the iTunes Store asks users to nominate their \"least favourite car\".) And things are getting worse: these days, you find yourself forced to choose passwords with both upper- and lower-case letters, and what normal human being can remember multiple combinations of those? Not you, that's for sure.</p> <p>One reason not to feel too guilty about your bad password behaviour is that it seems to be almost universal. Last month, an analysis of leaked pin numbers revealed that about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2012/sep/28/debit-cards-currentaccounts?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">one in 10 of us uses \"1234\"</a>; a recent security breach at Yahoo showed that thousands of users' passwords were either \"password\", \"welcome\", \"123456\" or \"ninja\". People choose terrible passwords even when more is at stake than their savings: among military security specialists, it's well-known that at the height of the cold war, the \"<a href=\"http://tywkiwdbi.blogspot.co.uk/2008/11/us-nuclear-secret-unlock-code-was.html\" title=\"\">secret unlocking code</a>\" for America's nuclear missiles was 00000000. Five years ago, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7097101.stm\" title=\"\">Newsnight revealed</a> that, until 1997, some British nuclear missiles were armed by turning a key in what was essentially a bike lock. To choose whether the bomb should explode in the air or on the ground, you turned dials using an Allen key, Ikea-style. There weren't any passcodes at all. Speed of retaliation, in the event of an enemy attack, counted for everything.</p> <p>The parlous state of our passwords is the result of a different arms race, between malicious hackers and \"white-hat\" security testers. But when you talk to some of the people most deeply involved, it soon becomes clear that the conventional wisdom is flawed. For example: writing down your passwords may be an excellent plan. Employers who insist on their staff changing passwords every 90 days probably aren't increasing security, and may be making things worse. The same goes for some of the password rules that your bank insists you follow \u2013 no more than 12 characters, spaces not allowed, etcetera. At the bottom of all this is the truth that passwords, as a method for keeping our most private data secure on the internet, are fundamentally broken. When I asked the veteran security researcher <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=6&amp;ved=0CEIQFjAF&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fweb.cheswick.com%2Fches%2Ftalks%2Frethink.pdf&amp;ei=xrdpUO2vMsrU0QWW3IGgDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHjfwkOt7JmvPS_MY67khMQ0LNJlA\" title=\"\">Bill Cheswick</a> if there was a&#xa0;way to solve the problem once and for all, he thought about it, then suggested, \"Burn your computer and go to the beach.\" But though the system may be in chaos, there are things you can do to stay both safe and sane. It's just that they are not necessarily the things you've been told.</p> <p>Password hacking takes many different forms, but one crucial thing to understand is that it's often not a matter of devilish cunning but of bludgeoning with brute force. Take the example of a hacker who sneaks on to a company's servers and steals a&#xa0;file containing a few million passwords. These will (hopefully) have been encrypted, so he can't just log into your account: if your password is \"hello\" \u2013 which of course it shouldn't be \u2013 it might be recorded in the file as something like \"$1$r6T8SUB9$Qxe41FJyF/3gkPIuvKOQ90\". Nor can he simply decode the gobbledegook, providing \"one-way encryption\" was used. What he can do, though, is feed millions of password guesses through the same encryption algorithm until one of them \u2013 bingo! \u2013 results in a matching string of gobbledegook. Then he knows he's found a password. (An additional encryption technique, known as \"salting\", renders this kind of attack impractical, but it's unclear how many firms actually use it.)</p> <p>This is where the length of your password makes an almost unbelievable difference. For a&#xa0;hacker with the computing power to make 1,000 guesses per second, a five-letter, purely random, all-lower-case password, such as \"fpqzy\", would take three and three-quarter hours to crack. Increase the number of letters to 20, though, and the cracking time increases, just a little bit: it's&#xa0;6.5&#xa0;thousand trillion centuries.</p> <p>Then there's the question of predictability. Nobody thinks up passwords by combining truly random sequences of letters and numbers; instead they follow rules, like using real words and replacing the letter O with a zero, or using first names followed by a year. Hackers know this, so their software can incorporate these rules when generating guesses, vastly reducing the time it takes to hit on a correct one. And every time there's a new leak of millions of passwords \u2013 as happened to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/dec/13/gawker-hackers-passwords-twitter-wikileaks\" title=\"\">Gawker</a> in 2010 and to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jun/06/linkedin-hacking\" title=\"\">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jul/12/yahoo-voice-hack-attack-passwords-stolen\" title=\"\">Yahoo</a> this year \u2013 it effectively adds to a&#xa0;massive body of knowledge about how people create passwords, which makes things even easier. If you think you've got a clever system for coming up with passwords, the chances are that hackers are already familiar with it.</p> <p>The least hackable password, then, would be a&#xa0;long string of completely random letters, numbers, spaces and symbols \u2013 but you'd never remember it. However, because length matters so much, the surprising truth is that a longish string of random English words, all in lower case \u2013 say, \"awoken wheels angling ostrich\" \u2013 is actually much more secure than a shorter password that follows your bank's annoying rules, such as \"M@nch3st3r\". And easier to remember: you've already formed a&#xa0;memorable image of some noisy wheels waking up an ostrich fishing by a riverbank, haven't you? As the popular geek comic <a href=\"http://xkcd.com/\" title=\"\">XKCD</a> put it last year, making exactly this point, \"Through 20 years of effort, we've successfully trained everyone to use passwords that are hard for humans to remember, but easy for computers to guess.\"</p> <p>It gets worse: because passwords are too hard to remember, we've added account recovery processes involving security questions that are far too easy for the hackers to answer. That's how <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Palin_email_hack\" title=\"\">Sarah Palin's personal email was hacked</a> in 2008: the intruder correctly guessed information about her postal code and high school. A related weakness in account recovery was also to blame for a vicious hacking assault on the Wired magazine writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/aug/08/apple-amazon-patch-security\" title=\"\">Mat Honan</a> in August. Hackers managed to commandeer his Google account, send racist messages under his name on Twitter and remotely wipe all the data on his laptop, phone and iPad. All this happened, one of the hackers later told Honan via online messages, because Amazon's customer services line was happy to give out the last four digits of his credit card number \u2013 which was what Apple's customer services needed in order to reset access to his Apple iCloud account.</p> <p>Some websites will let you use a passphrase, like the one about the angling ostrich. But many won't \u2013 and in those cases, several security experts agree, you should defy your bank and write them down. Their logic is simple: when you know you can't commit something to paper, you keep it simple, so you end up choosing insecure passwords. (The same applies to the advice \u2013 sometimes a requirement \u2013 to change your password regularly: the more passwords you have to remember, the more pressure to choose easy ones.) \"I have 68 different passwords,\" a Microsoft security specialist named <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-security-guru-Jot-down-your-passwords/2100-7355_3-5716590.html\" title=\"\">Jesper Johansson</a> told a conference several years ago. \"If I am not allowed to write any of them down, guess what I am going to do? I am going to use the same password on every one of them.\" The cryptographer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Schneier\" title=\"\">Bruce Schneier</a>, another advocate of writing down passwords, points out that most of us are pretty good at maintaining the security of small scraps of paper. Whether you can trust your spouse, or your housemates, is the kind of security calculation you're qualified to make. Whether your bank account might be at risk from a Russian hacking collective really isn't.</p> <p>When I put this argument to Neil Aitken, a&#xa0;spokesman for the UK <a href=\"http://www.paymentscouncil.org.uk/who_we_are/\" title=\"\">Payments Council</a> \u2013 which oversees, among other things, the inter-bank transfers system and the Link network \u2013 he did a&#xa0;remarkably good job of remaining calm. The problem, he explained, is that the laws on fraud impose certain responsibilities on bank customers. If somebody swipes money from your account, you'll have a harder time getting it back if you're deemed to have been \"grossly negligent\" in protecting your passwords. \"You could have the most difficult-to-interpret password in the world, but if you tell someone else what it is, you've blown it.\" The council strongly advises British consumers never to write down or share their passwords.</p> <p>Both sides have a point. That's the problem with security: it's always a matter of trade-offs. More convenience means less security; more protection from remote attacks means less protection from a&#xa0;sneaky housemate. Would you rather run a&#xa0;slightly higher (but hard to quantify) risk of losing your money, or condemn yourself to years of password-related hassle? It's a question almost as perplexing as, \"What's your least favourite car?\"</p> <p>Bill Cheswick \u2013 \"Ches\" to his friends \u2013 is far from alone in believing that we're descending, as a&#xa0;society, into password chaos. What makes him unusual is that he's willing to accept responsibility for being partly to blame. In 1994, as a member of&#xa0;AT&amp;T's fabled research division, Bell Labs, he&#xa0;co-wrote a book with the evocative title of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Firewalls-Internet-Security-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/020163466X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349101406&amp;sr=8-1\" title=\"\">Firewalls And Internet Security: Repelling The Wily Hacker</a>. (He also coined the term \"proxy server\", one of several things that makes him, in internet circles, a minor deity.) The book helped lay the foundations for modern online security. But now, he says, when we meet in a Manhattan coffee bar, passwords have become \"a pain in the&#xa0;ass! Who can keep track of all these things?\" It's a&#xa0;subject on which Cheswick, a volubly enthusiastic man at most times anyway, grows so&#xa0;animated that people at other tables start to look up from their laptops. \"And all these rules! You&#xa0;have to mix symbols, cases, numbers\u2026\"</p> <p>Cheswick calls these \"eye-of-newt\" rules because they resemble recipes for magical potions, although sometimes, when getting carried away giving speeches, he has been known to call them \"password fascism\", too. \"I have 25 different accounts, so now I have to remember 25 different eye-of-newt passwords? That's <em>not gonna happen!</em>\"</p> <p>Besides, he argues, the focus on making passwords more complex is rapidly becoming irrelevant, because the more serious threat is from keyloggers \u2013 software surreptitiously installed on your computer, via the internet, that monitors the keys you're pressing. \"I don't care how good your password is \u2013 if I'm watching you type, I got you,\" he says. You can reduce the risk by using a&#xa0;Mac, or by upgrading from the insecure Windows XP to Windows 7, and installing anti-virus software. But the only real guarantee is never to visit the kinds of sites where such \"malware\" resides. And \"if the grandkids come round, and the teenage son types in one bad address? You're done.\" Hardly less sinister are \"phishing\" attacks, the topic of much media hype, in which an email or website that resembles something reputable, such as the log-in page of your bank, tricks you into parting with your password. (The basic anti-phishing advice is to check your browser address bar; to hover over links with your mouse to make sure they're what they claim to be; and never to provide your password in response to an email.)</p> <p>One day, we may not have to worry about any of this: there are innovations in development that might replace passwords entirely. Touchscreens could be configured to detect subtle aspects of your interactions with your computer \u2013 the distances between your fingers, the speeds at which you tap and scroll. Technologists at Rutgers University in New Jersey have built a prototype of a ring, worn on the finger, that would send tiny bursts of electricity through the user's skin to the screen, vouching for his or her identity. Fingerprint readers, built into some laptops already but with too many flaws to be taken seriously, could be improved. But don't hold your breath. \"Passwords aren't going away\" for the foreseeable future, Cheswick says. \"I can wish as hard as I&#xa0;want, but they're just too convenient.\"</p> <p>In the meantime, he recommends doing what I&#xa0;did, after thoroughly scaring myself researching this article: install a piece of software known as a \"password wallet\", such as <a href=\"http://lastpass.com/\" title=\"\">LastPass</a> or <a href=\"https://agilebits.com/onepassword\" title=\"\">1Password</a>. These generate fiendishly random passwords for each of&#xa0;the sites you visit, storing them all behind a&#xa0;single master password. I installed LastPass and chose a&#xa0;fairly long sequence of English words with digits. I am now in the disorienting position of not knowing, and never having known, the password to my email, for example, but it doesn't matter: LastPass provides it whenever it's needed.</p> <p>It's not a perfect solution. LastPass is secure to an almost problematic degree: since it conducts all its encryption and decryption on users' own computers, my master password is unknown to the company, which means no one will be able to help me should I forget it. (There's no recovery process based on security questions, either.) And so \u2013 yes \u2013 I've written it down, in coded form, on a&#xa0;scrap of paper, which I've carefully hidden. I&#xa0;hope to have the password memorised soon. There's no such thing as total security, let alone total security plus total convenience, but this feels like a workable compromise. I'd just better not forget where I hid that piece of paper.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron is facing intense pressure from his backbenchers to block the proposed \u00a330bn merger of BAE Systems with its European rival EADS unless \"vital safeguards\" to protect Britain's national interest are secured.</p> <p>More than 40 Conservative MPs have signed a letter calling on the prime minister to block the deal unless the French and German governments give up their stakes in the new company.</p> <p>The 45 MPs called on Cameron to use the government's \"golden share\" in BAE to win assurances that the merger will pose no danger to national security and there will be no weakening of Britain's special defence links with the US.</p> <p>The letter was released after the former chancellor Alistair Darling warned in the Financial Times that Britain would be \"taken to the cleaners\" unless the British government took a direct stake.</p> <p>In the letter, organised by the Tory MP Ben Wallace, the MPs say: \"The proposed takeover of BAE systems by EADS raises a significant number of issues which have profound consequences for Britain. Not only does her majesty's government have an obligation to make a political decision on the takeover, as the guardian of the 'golden share', but it also has a duty to safeguard Britain's national security and economic interests.</p> <p>\"We are concerned at a proposal which will put the bulk of Britain's defence industrial base in the hands of a company predominantly owned by the French and German governments. It has a German CEO and a headquarters already split between France and Holland. Without some vital safeguards we do not think that this deal will be in the UK's national nor manufacturing interest.\"</p> <p>Wallace, who is parliamentary private secretary to Kenneth Clarke, is MP for Wyre and Preston North. Many of his constituents work at the BAE plant at Warton.</p> <p>The merger of BAE and EADS would create the largest defence contractor in the world. BAE is keen for the deal to go ahead to help it cope with the impact of defence cuts around the world. EADS would like to use BAE's position in Washington to break into the US market.</p> <p>But the Tory MPs and Darling say the merger could be poorly balanced. Under the deal, EADS would control some 60% of the business, while BAE would hold 40%. The French and German governments, which each have a 22.35% share of EADS through direct and indirect shareholdings, would each control 9% of the new company.</p> <p>On Thursday, Germany's Der Spiegel magazine reported that negotiations between the UK, French and German governments over the deal were close to collapse. However, sources close to the transaction said BAE and EADS remained committed to establishing an agreement by the 10 October deadline.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/33c84138-0e3e-11e2-8b92-00144feabdc0.html#axzz28R2Meo79\" title=\"\">Darling told the FT it was \"totally unacceptable\"</a> France and Germany were seeking to take stakes in the new company while Britain was prepared to take a less active role.</p> <p>He said: \"We will be taken to the cleaners. I don't see how you could have a large new company like this with the French and German governments having large direct and indirect stakes and we have none. I would prefer that all three governments had minimal stakes.</p> <p>\"There is a danger that decisions in the defence and the commercial businesses could be taken on the basis of politics rather than what is best.\"</p> <p>BAE Systems played down MPs' concerns, saying the structure of the merged business would \"enable it to operate in a normal commercial manner which confers the same rights on all shareholders, large and small\".</p>",
  "<p>Margaret Hodge is turning the public accounts committee of the House of Commons into the most effective spending watchdog this country has ever had. This morning's report on <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmpubacc/532/53202.htm\" title=\"\">off-payroll arrangements in the public sector</a> is another example of the work it's doing to highlight the cost of tax avoidance to the UK.</p> <p>The target in this case is a simple one: it is dealing with the problem of public sector employees being paid off the public sector payroll, and instead being paid through a contract with their own personal service company.</p> <p>For most of the media this morning, this issue was all about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/05/bbc-presenters-tax\" title=\"\">the BBC and the fact that it has paid up to 25,000 people this way in the past year or so</a>. So let's get the obvious statement out of the way: if the BBC is paying people who work under its direction and control as contractors, when it is very clear they have fixed hours of work and obligations much the same as BBC staff, and when they are so integrated into the BBC hierarchy that they have regular slots, offices, BBC email addresses, and fees paid month in and month out, there's no excuse for this. The law is clear in these cases, and is that such people should be treated as employees and be subject to PAYE.</p> <p>PAYE is at the very heart of this issue. Apply PAYE and national insurance is due at 13.8% by the employer while the employee pays 12% until their earnings reach \u00a342,500, when the rate falls to 2%. All that adds up, and it's meant to. National insurance <a href=\"http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2012_complete.pdf\" title=\"\">should contribute \u00a3106bn to the public purse this year</a>. That's income we need.</p> <p>Pay the same income through a contractor's own company and three things happen. First, the paying company does not have to pay that 13.8% employer's national insurance. Second, it has no employment obligations to the contractor. Third, the contractor can now pay themselves (and maybe their spouse or partner) by way of dividends and not only save national insurance, but reduce their tax bill too.</p> <p>If the person supplying services through such a company is really trading and really taking risk then the use of companies in this way has been hard to challenge, as HM Revenue &amp; Customs know. We shouldn't forget that some BBC contractors are really undertaking a trade, are supplying their own equipment and do take real risk. But when a contractor sitting in someone else's office or studio uses this arrangement, tax and national insurance are avoided. What's more, if the contracting company is struck off (<a href=\"http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Documents/500000Final.pdf\" title=\"\">as more than 500,000 companies were in 2009-10</a>) before it pays over the tax it owes, then the practice can all too easily become tax evasion.</p> <p>As the parliamentary accounts committee revealed, HMRC investigated just 23 cases of this sort in 2010-11. No one knows how many there are: the data is only available for the civil service (2,400) and the BBC (maybe 25,000). There are, however, <a href=\"http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/about/busRegArchive/businessRegisterStatisticsAugust2012.pdf\" title=\"\">2.9m companies in the UK</a>. In 2002, before this practice became commonplace, there were about 1.7m. A large part of that growth is likely to be down to contracting. The likely losses resulting are enormous as the practice is rampant throughout the state sectors, the NHS, local government and most especially the private sector. Let's be clear: I am quite sure all the newspapers jumping up and down about this issue at the BBC pay many of their \"staff\" as contractors.</p> <p>There are four problems that follow. The first is that this is always done for better-paid staff: the impression that tax avoidance is for the well-off is reinforced. This is a divided country.</p> <p>Second, because the penalties for this abuse always fall on the contractor and not on the paying company (as a result of large business lobbying) there is nothing that can really be done right now to stop this practice.</p> <p>Third, with HMRC still sacking thousands of staff a year, there is no real prospect of any effective challenge at contractor level to this abuse. Even if it increases the number tenfold, just 230 cases will be raised a year: that's practically no deterrent at all.</p> <p>Last but not least, the government deficit will grow as long as this abuse is not stopped. And that is the paradox. We have a government whose chancellor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/apr/10/george-osborne-richest-avoid-tax\" title=\"\">says tax avoidance is repugnant</a>. And it says deficit reduction is its number one priority. And yet it will do nothing to stop such abuse, preferring to impose cuts on the poorest instead.</p> <p>This is not an issue about the BBC. That's important, but a sideshow. This is an issue about the whole ethos of government and its right to charge and collect tax to pay for essential public services in his country. And unless action is taken, it follows as surely as the BBC News being on at 10 that those public services will have to be cut.</p> <p>In which case, is that what the blind eye the government is turning, indicated by record low levels of investigation, really all about?</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>9.40am: A study by engineers based at the <a href=\"http://www.ntnu.edu/research/energy-environment\">Norwegian University of Science and Technology</a> has questioned some common assumptions about the environmental credentials of electric cars.</p> <p>Published this week in the Journal of Industrial Ecology, the \"<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00532.x/full\">comparative environmental life cycle assessment of conventional and electric vehicles</a>\" begins by stating that \"it is important to address concerns of problem-shifting\". By this, the authors mean that by solving one problem, do electric cars create another? And, if so, does this environmental harm then outweigh any advantages?</p> <p>The study highlights in particular the \"toxicity\" of the electric car's manufacturing process compared to conventional petrol/diesel cars. It concludes that the \"global warming potential\" of the process used to make electric cars is twice that of conventional cars.</p> <p>The study also says - as has been noted many times before - that electric cars do not make sense if the electricity they consume is produced predominately by coal-fired power stations. \"It is counterproductive to promote [electric vehicles] EVs in regions where electricity is produced from oil, coal, and lignite combustion,\" it concludes.</p> <p>So, should this new study make us reassess the environmental credentials of electric cars? Or does the analysis and data help us, as the authors insist, improve the environmental performance of electric cars?

Here's the key conclusion:</p> <blockquote> <p>The production phase of EVs proved substantially more environmentally intensive. Nonetheless, substantial overall improvements in regard to GWP [global warming potential], TAP [terrestrial acidification potential], and other impacts may be achieved by EVs powered with appropriate energy sources relative to comparable ICEVs [internal combustion engine vehicles]. However, it is counterproductive to promote EVs in regions where electricity is produced from oil, coal, and lignite combustion. The electrification of transportation should be accompanied by a sharpened policy focus with regard to life cycle management, and thus counter potential setbacks in terms of water pollution and toxicity. EVs are poised to link the personal transportation sector together with the electricity, the electronic, and the metal industry sectors in an unprecedented way. Therefore the developments of these sectors must be jointly and consistently addressed in order for EVs to contribute positively to pollution mitigation efforts.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>10.38am: In the comment below, @MartynW <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18666888\">asked</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>Does this study take account of cars being one of the most recycled products we use?</p> </blockquote> <p>Guillaume Majeau-Bettez, one of the paper's authors, has just emailed me this in response:</p> <blockquote> <p>The crucial importance of recycling is one of the conclusions of our analysis.

For human toxicity, our study partly addresses the difference between emissions to densely populated and less populated areas, though this could certainly be improved. However, we cannot think only of the toxicity on humans; we also address toxic impacts on aquatic life and ecosystems.</p> <p>@Seb: This is one of our core finding: because the production of an electric car causes roughly twice the climate impact of producing a comparable conventional car, it must run on rather clean electricity to \"make up\" for the initial climate impact.<br>Further on @Seb: All use phase energy requirements were based on industry performance tests with the New European Driving Cycle, following the UNECE 101 regulation (UNECE 2005). These tests combine four elementary urban<br>driving cycles and one extra-urban driving cycle, with regenerative charging and energy losses during overnight charging included for EVs.</p> <p>@Guess11: Following industry standard, we based our assessment of the use-phase on the \"New European Driving Cycle\", which includes a typical share of stop-start.</p> <p>As many readers point out, the electric car industry is young and will likely improve in the future.

The automotive industry manufactures \u2013 or is developing \u2013 a broad array of low and ultra-low carbon vehicles, from highly efficient petrol and diesel models, through gas, biofuel and hydrogen, to hybrid, plug-in hybrid, pure-electric and fuel cell vehicles. Every year, the latest drivetrain technologies see emissions reduced, with today's new cars emitting on average 20% less than their 10 year old counterparts. Significant investment is ongoing, with worldwide R&amp;D powering the continuous improvement of existing technologies and the introduction of other low carbon innovations.<br>In terms of the lifecycle emissions of electric vehicles, the energy industry in Europe is constrained by legally binding limits on the total amount of CO2 emitted each year, up to 2020 (EU Emissions Trading Scheme 2009/29/EC). This limit reduces year-on-year to achieve an overall reduction in CO2 emissions. This means, in practice, that if overall energy demand increases as a result of electric vehicles (or for any other reason) then the increase in demand must be met with electricity from renewable or zero carbon generation sources.<br>In addition, measures such as the EU's Renewable Energy Directive, which requires 20% of renewable energy by 2020, are positive strategies to achieve CO2 reductions while the European Emissions Trading Scheme requires electricity suppliers to reduce their overall CO2 emissions.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>12.11pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18668194\">Robert Wilson</a>, from the University of Strathclyde's department of mathematics, raises an important point below the line:</p> <blockquote> <p>Simply decarbonizing electricity assuming no increases to demand appears to be a massive challenge. Our choice on transportation appears to be between increased fuel efficiency, a switch to \"cleaner\" fossil fuels and a push for increased public transportation, or aiming for something like 100% electric cars. The first approach is guaranteed some level of success. The second, however will fail completely if the electricity grid is not fully decarbonized.

On average, the fine particulate emissions per passenger-km are 3.6 times greater for electric cars than for gasoline cars. That's better than for diesel cars but on par with diesel buses, which can spread their environmental impact across the number of passengers they carry. \"If we compare gasoline car emissions to electric car emissions, the electric cars look very, very bad,\" says Christopher Cherry, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at University of Tennessee. \"So the point is that you have to consider the emissions exposure when the exposure source is far apart \u2014 the electrical power plant as opposed to the tailpipe of a car.\"</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>12.30pm: As background reading, I have examined the issue of whether \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2011/jan/17/electric-car-emissions\">electric cars really produce fewer emissions</a>\" before.

This applies over a full life cycle, taking account of emissions from power generation and emissions relating to production and disposal.

We need to know the facts about electric cars, their true total impact. Here I will point out something, we still don't know the true impact of the internal combustion cars and the fuel they use. This information is obfuscated by historical habit, for 100 years no one wanted to know. For example, how much electricity from coal burning power plants goes into refining oil? Try and find out how much per gallon? I've asked when filming at a massive oil refinery that had it's own set of pylons coming from a nearby coal burner. No one wants to tell you. (estimates range from between 4 -7 kWh per gallon) We know we need to change the way we generate electricity, with or without electric vehicles this is vitally important. We know what comes out of the tailpipe of an ICE car, toxic and carcinogenic gasses which cause untold levels of harm to human beings. We do know that 100 miles in an electric car uses around 24kWh, in an ICE car around 110 kWh. So from a global energy perspective that's a massive reduction in energy needs.<br>We do know that most EV drivers charge the car at night when the amount of coal burnt to produce electricity is at it's lowest, we know that coal makes up under 30% of the UK grid supply during peak times. We know that most people who drive EV's also install solar panels, I have. In one year, my Nissan Leaf used 5,340 kWh and my solar panels produced 3,555 kWh. We know that an electric car can run on electricity from any source, a fossil burner can only burn fossils.<br>So what about the battery toxicity? Are we just going to throw away the battery after the car has done 150,000 miles? No, of course not. Nissan are about to open a massive battery re-cycling plant at their Sunderland works. What about the massive piles of worn parts the traditional motor industry produces, clutches, waste lubricating oil, the platinum in catalytic converters, filters, pumps, the list goes on and on. Are they thrown away? of course not, they are recycled. What about the materials that go into making traditional cars, sourced and shipped from all over the world. The true well to wheel argument is a minefield, and this report has dived in feet first. Good luck to them.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 14 --> <p>1.10pm: Here's another email from Guillaume Majeau-Bettez, one of the paper's authors, this time on the question that I put to him about whether they had also looked at regional variations when it came to the carbon intensity of electricity production. For example, in terms of reducing emissions, is the US grid better or worse than Europe's for charging electric cars?</p> <blockquote> <p>This is outside the original scope of our study. We did not address electric vehicles on a region-per-region basis, but rather on a per-electricity-source basis. This can get quite complex; the electricity mix in any given point can differ from the average (national, regional) mix, and will also fluctuate with time (time of day, season, etc.) Speaking in general terms, however, the average US grid is more fossil fuel and global warming intensive than the European grid.</p> <p>Referring to the latest \"Life Cycle Inventories of Electricity Mixes and Grid\", the US mix causes roughly 800 gCO2-equivalent per kWh of low voltage electricity at grid, compared to roughly 500 for the European mix. (see <a href=\"http://www.esu-services.ch/fileadmin/download/publicLCI/itten-2012-electricity-mix.pdf\">http://www.esu-services.ch/fileadmin/download/publicLCI/itten-2012-electricity-mix.pdf</a> - p. 207)</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 15 --> <p>2.12pm: <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/marcello.contestabile\">Dr Marcello Contestabile</a>, a research fellow at the <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/icept\">Centre for Energy Policy and Technology</a> at Imperial College London who specialises in battery technologies \"in the context of road transport\", has emailed me his thoughts:</p> <blockquote> <p>In the last few years there has been a lot of hype around electric vehicles and as a result their environmental credentials have often been somewhat overstated. However, experts are well aware of the fact that well-to-wheel carbon emissions of EVs are strongly dependent on the carbon intensity of the electricity used, and that in extreme cases these could even be higher than those of conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. Lifecycle environmental impacts of electric vehicles are comparatively less well understood and hence studies such as Hawkins et al are needed.<br>In a recent consultancy piece I have conducted with other colleagues at Imperial College (<a href=\"http://www.lcaworks.com/EV%20Lit%20Rev%20FINAL.pdf\">http://www.lcaworks.com/EV%20Lit%20Rev%20FINAL.pdf</a>), we arrive at results that are largely in agreement with Hawkins et al. In particular, we have focused on greenhouse gas emissions and we have reviewed previous studies showing that manufacturing of electric vehicles, and particularly batteries, is likely to be more energy intensive than that of conventional internal combustion engines. However, this can be more than offset over the lifetime of the vehicle if the latter is powered by low carbon electricity and the battery lifetime is comparable to that of an internal combustion engine.<br>In our piece we also argue that the fact that battery technology is still evolving could help mitigating the problem. In fact, for electric vehicles to gain a significant share of the market the cost and weight of batteries need to reduce significantly and their durability increase. Reducing costs involves using cheaper materials, and hence those based on less energy intensive materials would be favoured; reducing weight means using lighter but also less material per unit energy stored, which again could reduce the overall environmental impact of battery manufacturing.<br>In conclusion, it is plausible that the currently higher environmental impact of manufacturing electric vehicles will naturally reduce somewhat if these are adopted on a large scale; at the same time, decarbonising power generation is imperative and it is in this context that electric vehicles should be considered. However, both my analysis and Hawkins et al also suggest that more research on lifecycle impacts of electric vehicles (and indeed any other vehicle technology) is necessary and that road transport policies need to better account for these impacts in order to provide a level playing field where more environmentally benign technologies are adequately rewarded.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 16 --> <p>2.24pm: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/electricandy\">Andy Heiron</a>, Renault UK's head of <a href=\"http://www.renault-ze.com/en-gb/z.e.-news/renault-uk-puts-ev-case-forward-in-fuels-of-the-future-debate-81315.html\">electric vehicle programme</a>, has sent me his thoughts:</p> <blockquote> <p>Most of the environmental impact of a car comes in use and in this respect EV's already offer a significant 'well to wheel' advantage, even with the relatively 'dirty' grid mix in the UK. Taking into account the proposed Committee on Climate Change target of 300g/KWh, this would equate to w2w for <a href=\"http://www.renault-ze.com/en-gb/z.e.-range/zoe/renault-zoe-expression-1944.html\">ZOE</a> (210km range, NEDC) of 31.4g/km, and I cannot see ICE technology getting close to that level by 2020.<br>Without access to, or the time to study, this report, it's difficult to add much on the production impacts, but the statement the production of EV's has twice the global warming impact seems high, and perhaps, as one of the authors admitted, reflects the current reality of (low volume) production. Again, I can only comment on the Renault situation where EV's are built in the same factories alongside ICE products and so suggest that a difference of this magnitude seems unlikely.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>2.44pm: <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/about/dr-doug-parr-chief-scientist\">Doug Parr</a>, Greenpeace UK's chief scientist and policy director, <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/newsdesk/energy/data/data-do-electric-cars-cause-more-pollution-fossil-fuel-alternatives\">has responded</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Whilst unable to go over the report with a fine toothcomb, the broad conclusions seem right in that:</p> <p>1. <a href=\"http://www.lowcvp.org.uk/news/1644/lowcvp-study-highlights-importance-of-measuring-whole-life-carbon-emissions/\">Ricardo research for LowCVP</a> showed that the climate costs of production of electric vehicles are significant, in particular, in relation to the battery. Policy that ignores this could create perverse incentives.</p> <p>2. Electricity is a carrier of energy, not the primary energy itself. Once fabricated, running electric vehicles off a power system run by lignite will generate increased emissions rather than savings, and generally will off coal too.</p> <p>3. <a href=\"http://assets.wwf.org.uk/downloads/electric_vehicles_research.pdf\">Element Energy</a> have calculated that in 2030, even with EVs representing three-quarters of the total car stock, the additional demands are less than 10% of forecast electricity demand at that time for all end uses.</p> <p>4. It remains an environmental imperative to conserve scarce resources like the minerals and rare earths necessary for battery fabrication. Saving CO2 does not justify laxity on mining standards or waste management.</p> <p>5. The importance of electric vehicles \u2013 and hydrogen-fuelled ones - is that they provide a way of moving away from a hydrocarbon based transport system. Electric vehicle development and mass-production cannot just be switched on and off overnight. So EVs can be supported if there is a broad consensus that decarbonisation of the power system will take place, and a strong implementation plan in a country.</p> <p>6. However, the longer term options of technology change should not obscure the fact that in the short term most of the emissions savings in transport will come from better efficiency of petrol and diesel vehicles. Emissions standards for cars and vans, as are being discussed in Europe and member states this autumn, are the most important measure for reducing emissions over the next decade. Changes in vehicle technology and production that these standards require will generally be helpful in making EVs a more attractive commercial proposition.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 18 --> <p>4.37pm: </p> <h2>My verdict</h2> <p>The authors of this new paper are evidently not saying that electric cars are \"bad\" for the environment in all circumstances, but they are confirming what many already knew: that as electric cars become more popular - which is being encouraged by policymakers across many countries - we mustn't lose sight of the fact that the carbon intensity of the electricity used to power them is key. Another crucially important factor to monitor (and, hopefully, ameliorate) is just how energy- and resource-intensive the production of these vehicles can be.</p> <p>The problem for electric cars is that they will only increase their environmental credentials (compared to \"conventional\" cars) once more and more of them are made and used, which, in itself, will drive faster and deeper innovation in battery technology, production efficiencies and end-of-life recyclability. It's somewhat unfair to compare them to conventional cars at present because they are an immature, fledgling technology, but the opportunity for increased efficiency throughout their lifecycle seems significant as/if they become more popular.</p> <p>But a bigger problem, perhaps, is that their environmental \"success\" hangs largely on factors beyond their manufacturers' control. As has been shown in China, electric cars powered by electricity generated through the burning of coal and oil make very little environmental sense. They need to run off a low-carbon, \"smart\" grid where renewables and nuclear do much of the heavy lifting. So policy-makers have a twin challenge if they want to see more people driving electric cars: they need to ensure a low-carbon, smart grid is delivered and they need to assist manufacturers in bringing down the cost of these vehicles. Doing that in a synchronised and timely manner is going to be hard, but a prize worth reaching for.</p>",

Almost everyone, it seemed, had heard the stories.</p> <p>There are many things people know, or think they know, bits of information passed round like samizdat manuscripts in the Soviet Union: such and such a film star is gay, a politician likes young boys \u2013 that kind of thing. Now and again someone tells us journalists, \"Of course, you know, but you can't print it, can you?\" with a secretive chuckle. And, more often than you might think, it actually is true.</p> <p>Shortly after he died, the <a href=\"http://www.theoldie.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Oldie magazine </a>ran an article about Savile preying on underage girls, but it was completely ignored.</p> <p>\u2712<a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=The%20Labour%20conference%20site:theguardian.com#q=The+Labour+conference+site%3Atheguardian.com&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvnsu&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=nws&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OO9uULLnJci40QWOuIG4BQ&amp;ved=0CCEQqAI&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=c9489f8b4147889c&amp;biw=938&amp;bih=822\" title=\"\">The Labour conference</a> this year was quiet, and the vast press room two-thirds empty most of the time. One of the bright spots was the security team from <a href=\"http://www.g4s.com/\" title=\"\">G4S, </a>who were delightful. Their wretched bosses don't deserve them.</p> <p>I was struck by the way Labour politicians have started to praise famous Tories of the past, if only to compare them favourably with the present lot. So far it's just Disraeli and Peel (and Churchill of course). We'll know politics have changed when a Labour speaker says, \"Sadly, they are no longer the party of Margaret Thatcher \u2026\"</p> <p>I was fascinated to learn there about a website called <a href=\"http://www.leftwingdating.co.uk/\" title=\"\">leftwingdating.co.uk</a>, designed so that people of similar views can get together for fun, romance and discussions of predistribution. The flyer shows a picture of a handsome couple chinking glasses of champagne; it looks as if it ought to have a caption saying something like, \"Book our function room to celebrate those cherished wedding day moments.\"</p> <p>There is also a helpful list of events where you might go with someone you have contacted through the site. So there's the <a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/economy/tuc-21056-f0.cfm\" title=\"\">TUC mass demo </a>on 20 October and the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/01/11/president-obama-issues-call-action-invest-america-white-house-insourcing\" title=\"\">Call to Action for Obama</a>.</p> <p>I wonder if anyone has ever thought of forming a rightwing equivalent. You would have to tick boxes. \"How do you feel about immigration? Totally opposed? Send them all home, now? Hanging's too good for them?\" Or, \"Benefit cuts for the so-called disabled? (a) Of course? (b) End payouts to scroungers \u2013 and everyone else? (c) Kick 'em downstairs and see how disabled they really are?\" Key dates would include Ukip conferences, Countryside Alliance marches, but no BNP events, because they are not the beautiful, glass-chinking people.</p> <p>\u2712Ruth Winstone edited <a href=\"http://www.chrismullinexmp.com/\" title=\"\">Chris Mullin's diaries</a> (a treat) and nine volumes of <a href=\"http://www.tonybenn.com/\" title=\"\">Tony Benn</a>'s (how could anyone manage that?) She has had the bright idea of telling the last 90 years in British politics by way of extracts from diaries. It's called Events, Dear Boy, Events (\u00a325, Profile Books), and if there is rather too much of Benn and Edwina Currie, there are the more pleasingly acerbic entries of Mullin and Alan Clark.</p> <p>In late 1997, Clark said that the royal family had \"delighted at the elimination of Diana \u2026 and have settled back into their favourite role, the preservation of their own perks and privileges at the expense, wherever necessary, of other individuals and institutions.\" Even Benn might not have written that. Gyles Brandreth wrote earlier that year, during the election campaign, \"Labour press officer quote of the day: 'Later today Tony Blair will be spontaneous. Tomorrow he will be passionate.'\"</p> <p>\u2712My parents lived in Farnham, Surrey, for a quarter of a century. It's a handsome market town, a mixed blend of city commuters and farmworkers, large family houses and charming cottages, small winding lanes and fine old buildings. So naturally, in keeping with modern Britain, it has to be ruined. The local council, <a href=\"http://www.waverley.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Waverley</a>, based away in Goldalming, is almost unanimously Tory. For years, it has been pushing ceaselessly for a hideous new development of houses, shops and offices in the eastern part of the town. Farnham's councillors are outnumbered and can do little to stop the development going ahead, even though local opinion is by every measure utterly opposed to this appalling plan.</p> <p>Aha, you might think, at least they can enlist the support of their local MP! Step forward Jeremy Hunt. You can understand their near despair.</p> <p>\u2712Jack Gold arrived early for his 10pm train at Berkhamsted station. It was a cold night, so he looked for the waiting room, which was closed. On the door someone had left the message \"Shut Happens\".</p>",
  "<p>From the first day, the message was clear: keep calm and carry on. On 27 April, Pep Guardiola, appeared in the press room at the Camp Nou to announce that he was leaving at the end of the season. Sat among the journalists were a handful of Barcelona players but Lionel Messi was not one of them. He later said that he just couldn't be there: the emotion was too great. Barcelona's most successful coach was leaving, the man who symbolised the club better than anyone else, ever.</p> <p>By the time the press conference was called, everyone expected Guardiola to walk. What they did not expect was for Sandro Rosell, the club's president, to announce at the same time that the new manager would be Tito Vilanova, until then Barcelona's No2.</p> <p>Psychologically, the situation had been managed expertly. A crisis turned into a succession, a smooth transition. Guardiolismo without Guardiola? Continuity was the word. One Catalan columnist suggested that Tito could be Paisley to Guardiola's Shankly. \"I was pleased when I heard the news,\" Messi said. \"Tito was the first person to put me in the&#xa0;team.&#xa0;Until then I was a sub or didn't play at all.\"</p> <p>Messi was talking about when he was 13. Vilanova was his coach in Barcelona's La Masia youth system. Gerard Piqu\u00e9 and Cesc F\u00e1bregas were among his team-mates. Vilanova became close friends with Guardiola when the two of them were progressing through La Masia themselves and together they spent four years coaching the first team. The season before that, they had coached Barcelona's B team together, managing players such as Pedro and Sergio Busquets.</p> <p>Thierry Henry once called Vilanova Guardiola's \"brother\". They had the same vision. Vilanova's few interviews before this year revealed a man even more committed to their footballing identity than Guardiola.</p> <p>Barcelona's vice-president this week admitted that Guardiola had been involved, with Vilanova, in preparing this season. In signing Jordi Alba, for example. Buying a central midfielder and employing him at centre-back has a familiar ring to it, too. On Sunday, Barcelona's central defenders against Real Madrid will be Javier Mascherano and Alex Song. Mascherano has adapted. Song, so far, has not.</p> <p>\"I don't think there will be big variations in the way that we do things. Every person, every coach, is different but we're expecting something similar,\" Andr\u00e9s Iniesta said before the start of the season.</p> <p>\"I am not going to change things just for the sake of it,\" said Vilanova, who does not have the seductive quality of Guardiola. Nor, should results turn against him, does he have the mass appeal and power that facilitate resistance. But he is tough. \"He is very direct. He doesn't mess around with stupid things,\" Xavi says. \"Tito has surprised me. I knew he had personality but the leader was always Pep. Now he is a leader as well. As a No2 he didn't talk so much.\"</p> <p>\"They have different personalities,\" Messi says, \"but the work is the same.\" This is backed up by Xavi: \"The training sessions have not changed.\"</p> <p>Under Vilanova, Barcelona have won six from six and already have an eight-point lead over Real Madrid. Victory on Sunday night in <em>el cl\u00e1sico</em>, the third already this season after the teams met in the Spanish Super Cup, won on away goals by Real, would open up a lead that borders on the decisive. It is early to say that, of course. Just as it is early too to draw conclusions about Vilanova. Not least because Barcelona's perfect start to La Liga has disguised the fact that it has been far from perfect. There has been a hint of vulnerability.</p> <p>Barcelona still play a 4-3-3 based on possession and swift circulation of the ball. Statistics underline the similarities: under Vilanova Barcelona have so far completed an average of 696.8 passes per game, compared with 709 last season, with completion at 88.6% compared with 88.5%. They have scored 2.86 goals per game against 3.0 last season and taken 12.2 shots compared with 13.0. That control is about protection as well as penetration and they have faced 2.8 shots per game this season compared with 2.7 last year.</p> <p>Vilanova has changed things; small details, nuances. Barcelona have appeared a little less elaborate and a little more direct, pushing a little higher up the pitch. Against Benfica on Wednesday they utilised the long diagonal to the left to open up the pitch and the only statistic that is markedly different between Vilanova's Barcelona and Guardiola's is the percentage of their passes played into the final third \u2013 36.8% now, against 30.2% last season and 28.6% over the course of Guardiola's time. But then against Benfica the second-half orders were the opposite: Vilanova preached patience.</p> <p>There have been other tweaks enforced and illustrated by injury and rotation. Following the international break, Vilanova left a jet-lagged Messi on the bench. Logical enough but rarely done before. Messi came on to win the game. Barcelona's 4-3-3 has been applied with two of the front three out wide, Vilanova using Cristian Tello where Guardiola opted for the currently injured Isaac Cuenca. It has also been applied with the team narrow and F\u00e1bregas advancing beyond Messi to create a system that has two centre-forwards \u2013 almost a 4-2-2-2.</p> <p>F\u00e1bregas has scored three in his past two games; he had gone without a goal since February. Messi, meanwhile, played deeper and did not score against Sevilla or Benfica. He did, though, provide four assists. When behind, Vilanova has been swift to switch to 3-4-3. He has even used something similar to a 4-2-3-1. It has worked. Five times this season, Barcelona have trailed. In four, Vilanova intervened to change the game and secure victory. The fifth, however, was against Real Madrid.</p>",
  "<p>The appeal of any presidential candidate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/sep/04/comment.usa\">argued Richard Nixon's speechwriter, Raymond Price</a>, is based on a \"gut reaction, unarticulated, non-analytical, a product of the particular chemistry between the voter and the image of the candidate \u2026 [It's] not what's there that counts, it's what's projected.\"</p> <p>In 2008, all the intestinal love went Obama's way. He didn't just advocate change, he looked and acted like change. While John McCain and Sarah Palin peddled in fear, Obama projected hope. He sent a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/03/tucker-carlson-obama-fox-news-bombshell\">\"thrill\" up MSNBC news anchor Chris Matthews' leg</a> and tears down old ladies' cheeks at rallies.</p> <p>Describing the crowd's reaction to him in Rockford, Illinois, Time's <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1546362-2,00.html\">Joe Klein wrote</a>: \"The white people \u2026 are out of control.\" The New York Times' <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/19/opinion/19brooks.html?_r=0\">David Brooks claimed</a>: \"With his multi-ethnic family and his globe-spanning childhood, there is a little piece of everything in Obama.\"</p> <p>When people \u2013 not all, but enough \u2013 looked at him, they felt something before they thought something, and it made them feel better about themselves and the country. Inevitably those feelings would fade in four years when they would also see his record. Fortunately for Obama, until now relatively few were focused on him. Instead, it was Romney's chemistry, or rather lack of it, that dominated.</p> <p>Democrats<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/18/mitt-romney-turning-into-john-kerry-2012-election\"> successfully framed Romney </a>as a wealthy, out-of-touch individual who didn't understand the needs of ordinary Americans. When people \u2013 once again not all, but enough \u2013 thought of him being president, they checked their gut <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/08/02/romneys-personal-image-remains-negative/\">and it made them queasy</a>. In July, a woman in West Virginia <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/issues/58_1/John-Boehner-Voters-Need-Not-Love-Mitt-Romney-215934-1.html\">asked Republican House speaker John Boehner</a>: \"Can you make me love Mitt Romney?\" Boehner said: \"No. Listen, we're just politicians. I wasn't elected to play God. The American people probably aren't going to fall in love with Mitt Romney.\"</p> <p>Wednesday's debate didn't make people like Romney but it did give some pause for a second look. It also shifted the focus back on to Obama and created the space to frame him in potentially damaging light. His distracted, absent, distant manner at the podium speaks to a criticism that has often been made that he is aloof, dispassionate and even haughty.</p> <p>This matters because narratives only work when they chime with a pre-existing condition. Tucker Carlson's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/03/tucker-carlson-obama-fox-news-bombshell \">ridiculous bombshell</a> didn't work because few people seriously believe that Obama, who was raised by his white mother and grandparents, really hates white people. Whitewater didn't work against Bill Clinton because few people seriously believed that he was financially corrupt. The Monica Lewinsky scandal, on that other hand, did work, because few had any trouble believing Clinton could not control his sexual appetite.</p> <p>Throughout his presidency, Obama has given the impression of being in some way <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/13/barack-obama-cool-to-cold\"> emotionally disconnected</a> and at times almost passive. This would be less than impressive at the best of times. But during a period of severe economic duress and political gridlock he has often appeared either uninterested and unwilling, or unable to fight back. \"You get the sense that this president, while intellectually engaged, is not emotionally engaged with what the American people are going through,\" says Michael Fletcher, the Washington Post's economics correspondent. \"People want to feel there's someone out there fighting their corner even if that person doesn't win.\"</p> <p>Some have argued that as the first black president, anger is simply not an avenue open to him if he wants to keep the public onside. But as Salim Muwakkil of <a href=\"http://www.inthesetimes.com/\">In These Times </a>pointed out, Obama runs the risk of falling into another stereotype that can be equally problematic.</p> <p>\"In some ways it's the epitome of the cool style,\" he said. \"Almost ironically it's a stereotype. It's like the pimp from Iceberg Slim. The guy who was not perturbed by anything. Murders would happen in his vicinity and he'd carry on as if nothing happened.\"</p> <p>Whatever the reasons, his performance on Wednesday reinforced the notion of a man not fully in the moment or in command of events. According to Ron Suskind's <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/09/obamas_economic_quagmire_frank.html \">Confidence Men</a>, Obama's former chief economic adviser, Larry Summers, reportedly told Peter Orszag: \"\"You know, Peter, we're really home alone. There's no adult in charge.\" That's the impression he gave on Wednesday night.</p> <p>Last week, Newt Gingrich <a href=\"http://thehill.com/video/campaign/258689-gingrich-obama-not-a-real-president \">disparaged him </a>saying he was \"not a real president\" and wondering about his \"rhythms\". It was more unsubtle race-baiting from the man who coined the term \"food-stamp president\". But one comment in particular stands out. \"He doesn't do anything that presidents do, he doesn't worry about any of the things the presidents do, but he has the White House, he has enormous power, and he'll go down in history as the president \u2013 and I suspect that he's pretty contemptuous of the rest of us.\" That charge has currency today that it didn't have before.</p> <p>This isn't the first time Obama has turned in a lousy debate performance. He's a good speaker; he's never been a good debater. But it's the first time he's been so bad at such a key moment. The most common, generous, explanation is that it's just not in his character to become excitable and animated, and that authentic beats empathetic. Maybe. But present beats absent and, given the country's needs, urgent beats laid-back.</p> <p>\"Americans would like their president to be sick and needy,\" explains James Zogby, head of the Arab American Institute and executive member of the Democratic executive committee. \"Bill Clinton would shake literally tens of thousands of hands every Christmas. Each person he'd meet would say: 'I think he remembered me.' Obama doesn't like to do it. No real person would like to do it. And therefore he doesn't do it. And people resent that. They want their president to really need them. He doesn't. He's OK, he's relaxed, cool, calm. I'd love him to call me up like Clinton would \u2026 people like that, he doesn't need it.\"</p> <p>But he needs them. And on Wednesday, at least, he lost them.</p>",

  "<p>The news from London was relayed from a mobile phone and suddenly the men and women who had been sitting silently in the meagre shade around a sun-scorched garden in Nairobi erupted: hugging, cheering, clapping, dancing and eventually raising their hands to the sky and praying.</p> <p>These veterans of Kenya's Mau Mau uprising had been waiting for hours for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/05/mau-mau-veterans-win-torture-case\" title=\"\">a ruling</a> that vindicated their right to claim damages for the torture and abuses carried out by British colonial authorities.</p> <p>\"I am very, very happy,\" said Wambugu Wa Nyingi, one of three claimants in the case. The UK government \"has done justice because it is a just government,\" he said, speaking in the Kikuyu language and leaning on a wooden stick.</p> <p>In his written evidence, Nyingi, 85, said he was arrested in 1952 and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/16/mau-mau-veterans-secret-documents\" title=\"\">detained for about nine years</a>. He was beaten unconscious and still bears the marks from leg manacles, whipping and caning.</p> <p>\"I just wanted the truth to be out. Even the children of my children should know what happened,\" he said. \"What should happen is that people should be compensated so they can begin to forgive the British government.\"</p> <p>The three claimants suffered what their lawyers describe as \"unspeakable acts of brutality\", including castration, beatings and severe sexual assaults.</p> <p>Jane Muthoni Mara, another claimant, clapped and cheered as the ruling was relayed. She hoped the British government would compensate the veterans.</p> <p>\"I'm very happy and my heart is clean,\" she said. Asked what she would tell her four children, she said simply: \"I will tell them I won.\"</p> <p>In her statement to the court, Mara, who is from the Kirinyaga district in central Kenya, said she was 15 when she was detained and beaten with sticks and a gun butt and had her legs stamped on. She was also sexually assaulted.</p> <p>\"My life was destroyed because I now live in a township and I don't have a farm of my own,\" she said.</p> <p>\"I am so proud of these old people,\" said Atsango Chesoni, the executive director of the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC). \"These people are the ones who allowed us to live, to go to school.\"</p> <p>She said she did not know how many other claimants would come forward.</p> <p>\"What we would like is a situation where the British just acknowledge that this happened, apologise and provide some form of compensation so that these people can live out their lives in some form of comfort,\" she said.</p> <p>After the ruling was announced, men in suits, straw hats or turbans, many brandishing traditional fly-whisks, and women in headscarves and colourful dresses danced around the garden behind the headquarters of the KHRC.</p> <p>Professor Henry Stanley Kabeca, a historian, stood watching the celebrations. He said he was a strong supporter of the Mau Mau.</p> <p>\"I feel delighted, completely vindicated. I got a bit demoralised in 1956 when our people surrendered from the forest as a defeated force. We only lost the battle, we won the war, and today is the climax of a long struggle.\"</p> <p>The ruling also marks a kind of catharsis for Kenya, where the history of the Mau Mau movement has always been controversial. After independence in 1963, the country's first two presidents tried to downplay the group's role in the struggle against the British.</p> <p>Kenya's most numerous ethnic group, the Kikuyu, was split between those who joined the insurgency, and so-called \"loyalists\" who sided with the British.</p> <p>\"It lays the foundation for us to confront the ghosts of the past in a candid way,\" said George Morara, senior programmes officer at the KHRC.</p> <p>\"For the veterans, it's been a long journey. Mandela said he took the long walk to freedom for 27 years. These guys have taken 50 years. It's been a much longer walk to freedom. So you can understand the sheer sense of jubilation. It's been a landmark ruling,\" he said.</p> <p>Morara said the KHRC was travelling around the country interviewing thousands of people to determine who else might be eligible for eventual compensation. A legal ban on the Mau Mau was only lifted in 2003.</p> <p>Charles Ngare, a member of the Mau Mau veterans' association, raised his hands above his head as a bearded man with a fly-whisk decorated in the Kenyan colours led a group prayer.</p> <p>The veterans \"feel born again. They feel so happy in their spirits,\" he said. \"This will make their spirits walk.\"</p>",
  "<p>The publisher of the Mail on Sunday has lost part of a high court libel case brought by a former Bank of Scotland director over two articles he said falsely implied he was involved in criminal conspiracies.</p> <p>Irfan Qadir, a prominent Asian businessman, said Associated Newspapers libelled him in two Mail on Sunday articles published in May and June 2011.</p> <p>The first article was about Qadir's past dealings with the owners of a London nightclub; the second reported a false allegation that the high-profile banker was involved in a massive mortgage fraud.</p> <p>In a judgment handed down at the high court on Friday, Mr Justice Tugendhat rejected two defences put forward by Associated Newspapers. The judge also made a finding of malice in relation to both articles.</p> <p>There will be a trial at a later date on the defence of justification, to determine whether the allegations relating to Qadir and the nightclub are true.</p> <p>Tugendhat severely criticised Associated Newspapers \u2013 and the press in general \u2013 for being too slow to admit when they have made a mistake.</p> <p>The senior libel judge said the press was guilty of a \"particular mischief\" because \"the press may get away with refusing to admit they have done wrong, when others would not get away with it\".</p> <p>Tugendhat made the rare general criticism after he censured Associated Newspapers for being slow to correct a Mail Online version of one of the allegedly libellous Mail on Sunday articles.</p> <p>The judge said there was a \"deliberate unfairness\" in the second Mail on Sunday article, published under the headline \"Top banker named in mortgage fraud case\", and ruled that it was \"not a fair and accurate report\" of court proceedings.</p> <p>The article reported a claim made in open court in an entirely separate criminal trial by a defence barrister that the ex-Bank of Scotland director was implicated in criminality.</p> <p>However, the article did not report that the judge in the same trial had explicitly stated \"Mr Qadir did not lend any money\" and had rebuked the defence barrister for pursuing the allegation. The story was written by Simon Watkins, the deputy editor of Financial Mail on Sunday, and based on a secondary news report of the proceedings.</p> <p>Tugendhat said in his judgment: \"Looking at the evidence as a whole, again I find that Mr Watkins was deliberately publishing a report that was unfair to Mr Qadir in omitting to attribute to the judge the statement that: 'Mr Qadir did not lend any money'.\"</p> <p>The judge said the first article, headed \"Bank of Scotland director 'drove us out with dogs,'\" was \"not the product of responsible journalism\" and rejected a defence of qualified privilege.</p> <p>The first article was based on claims made about Qadir in publicly available court documents obtained by a freelance journalist and passed to the Mail on Sunday. However, the article did not report that Qadir intended to fight the accusations. His defence was publicly available from the court.</p> <p>The article also reported that Qadir had declined to comment on the allegations, but the judge said the banker did not receive any messages from the Mail on Sunday although several had been left by the newspaper on a voicemail that was believed to be his.</p> <p>In his judgment, Tugendhat said the Mail on Sunday's defence of qualified privilege failed because \"the words complained of were a matter which was not of public concern and publication of which was not for the public benefit in that they omit to state that the claim is disputed, and include the misiniformation that Mr Qadir had declined to comment.\"</p> <p>The judge ruled that Qadir's claim of malice partially succeeded in respect of both articles, though the defences of privilege were rejected for other reasons.</p> <p>He said Associated Newspaper should have corrected a Mail Online version of the first article to make clear that Qadir had filed a defence and denied the claims.</p> <p>There will be a trial early in 2013 on whether Associated Newspaper's defence of justification on the nightclub allegation will be successful.</p> <p>Associated Newspapers said in a statement: \"This is a finding on a preliminary issue, in a case that has yet to go to full trial. It could have disturbing implications for journalists reporting legal actions on the basis of court documents. It introduces onerous new conditions a journalist must meet before being covered by legal privilege.</p> <p>\"It also demands that individual newspaper journalists must, in certain circumstances, amend online versions of articles over which they have no control. We believe the judgment is both wrong and damaging to the reporting of legal proceedings, and are seeking leave to appeal.\"</p> <p>Chris Hutchings, Qadir's solicitor welcomed the judgment. He said: \"Today's findings come at a particularly sensitive time for the media and this case has underlined the importance of responsible journalism.\"</p> <p>\"Legal privilege provides significant protection to the media but carries with it responsibilities concerning fairness and accuracy, in the public interest.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>First there was the presidential debate. Now come the all-important ad wars.</p> <p>The campaigns of President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney have now emerged from the Denver event engaged in a frenzy of spin and damage control.</p> <p>Seeking to capitalise on a largely unexpected win, which came after weeks of Romney gaffes and sinking poll numbers, the Republicans have released on to the nation's airwaves a lengthy video featuring footage of the Denver debate and a one-two punch of both negative and positive ads.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IGm47IIRQhc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IGm47IIRQhc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p></p> <p>But President Barack Obama's team have also featured the debate in a new ad, seeking to portray Romney as having misled voters during the highly-anticipated event. It shows Romney saying he was not in favour of a huge new tax plan during the debate in Colorado, interspersed with a news anchor saying his tax plan would in fact cost trillions of dollars and mostly benefit the wealthy. The Obama campaign called the ad Trust, and in the 30-second spot a narrator asks: \"Why won't Romney level with us about his tax plan?\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eV5m1NxffEs?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eV5m1NxffEs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p></p> <p>However, there is little doubt that the debate produced a much greater morale boost and source of campaign ammunition for the Republicans than it did the Democrats. Most media critics, and snap opinion polls of TV viewers, declared Romney as the winner of the debate by a sizeable margin. Obama was seen as turning in a flat and listless performance. The new Romney campaign video has a triumphalist air. It starts by showing Romney and his wife, Ann, walking towards the debate arena like boxers towards the ring. Then, to soaring piano music, it plays clips of Romney's best debate moments and Obama looking pensive or frustrated or down at his feet. The topics highlighted in the video are also largely bemoaning the parlous state of America's economic recovery. \"We know that the path we are taking is not working. It is time for a new path,\" Romney says.</p> <p>That theme is also taken up in a new TV ad from the Romney campaign. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTKOtgibTqw&amp;feature=player_embedded\">Called Twelve Million Jobs</a>, it touts Romney's plans to jump-start America's economy, and features a smiling, casually dressed Romney speaking directly to camera, cut with shots of him greeting an ethnically diverse crowd of workers. \"Let me tell you how I will create 12 million jobs when President Obama couldn't,\" Romney said.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BsHoWjzicUA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BsHoWjzicUA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p></p> <p>However, the largely sunny feel of that advert is not matched by a second Romney ad that was rapidly put up on the airwaves of several key swing states, including, crucially, Ohio where Romney has been trailing badly. That ad, called Who Will Raise Taxes?, charges that an \"independent, non-partisan\" study showed that Obama's tax policies will hike taxes for middle-class American families by $4,000 dollars. However, the study was in fact produced by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington thinktank.</p> <p>Such finagling of the truth is commonplace with both campaigns, but some experts believe that the attack ads will swamp what had actually been a decent debate where serious issues were discussed. \"This was a real debate with real differences, real clarity. Too bad voters have had to be assaulted by attack ads and hyper-emotion,\" said leading pollster John Zogby.</p>",
  "<p>Education officials in Edinburgh are to review their spending priorities after it emerged that the city has one of the worst records in Scotland for getting poor schoolchildren into top universities.</p> <p>An investigation by the Guardian found only seven children from the poorest areas of Edinburgh, the UK's second wealthiest city after London, got grades last year that could win them places at St Andrews or on the most competitive courses at Edinburgh and Glasgow universities.</p> <p>Paul Godzik, the convenor of Edinburgh's education committee, said: \"It should serve as a wake-up call not just for politicians in Edinburgh, but for politicians at all levels right across Scotland.</p> <p>\"Edinburgh has done a great deal of good work on access with Edinburgh university which has been very successful, but we have much more to do to raise aspirations and tackle inequality. I do think it's something we have to look at very carefully in the coming months.\"</p> <p>Figures released by the Scottish government under freedom of information legislation also revealed that only 220 of the poorest children from across Scotland, defined as being from the bottom fifth of deprived areas by postcode, achieved those grades - despite record rates of exam passes in Scottish schools.</p> <p>Just 2.5% of the 8,842 fifth year pupils from the poorest areas got three or more As in their Highers; a figure that has only improved by 0.5% since 2007. As few as 50 got grades good enough to compete for places at Oxford.</p> <p>The figures emerged as Mike Russell, the Scottish education secretary, intensified the pressure on Scotland's elite universities to increase admission rates for poor students. He has <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/education/universities-ordered-to-admit-deprived-students.19064588\" title=\"\">offered them \u00a310m to improve rates of admissions</a> but threatened them with fines if they failed to do so, as part of a new funding settlement.</p> <p>In June, the National Union of Students Scotland published data showing that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/jun/04/top-scottish-universities-poorest-students\" title=\"\">admission rates for poor students at Edinburgh, Aberdeen and St Andrew's were at 5% or less</a>, although the NUS figures failed to take account of each universities' admissions criteria.</p> <p>The University of St Andrews, which endured the heaviest criticism for admitting only 13 students from the poorest 20% of neighbourhoods last year, said the new data <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/27/scotland-poor-students-poverty-university\" title=\"\">vindicated their view</a> that too few poor students got the necessary grades.</p> <p>\"We cannot work alone, and it is simply fatuous in the face of these numbers to say that universities by themselves need to do more,\" a spokesman said. \"These statistics strongly suggest that as a nation we need an acceptance of the scale of the issue and a true societal effort to stop this haemorrhaging of talent.\"</p> <p>The data shows that Edinburgh's state schools are trailing behind far more deprived areas of Scotland, with only 1.4% of children from its poorest neighbourhoods achieving three or more As in Highers - the minimum needed for many top universities or degree courses.</p> <p>Of the 16 councils of comparable scale where detailed figures were available, Edinburgh had the joint worst rate of attainment in Scotland level with Dundee. The city had very weak performance across the social spectrum, with only 11% of all fifth year students getting three As or more. That figure only reached double figures because 19.5% of the wealthiest fifth of Edinburgh's state school pupils achieved those grades.</p> <p>The figures suggest significant differences in educational achievement across Scotland. Glasgow, which has nearly 2,400 fifth year pupils from the poorest 20% of households, saw 58 or 2.4% of those pupils get those grades - close to the Scotland-wide average of 2.5%.</p> <p>East Dunbartonshire, which like Edinburgh has a strong local economy but fewer areas of deprivation, achieved 8.6%, and in East Renfrewshire, the council with Scotland's best-performing schools, 5.6% of its poorest children achieve three As.</p> <p>Professor Lindsay Paterson, professor of educational policy at Edinburgh university, said these disparities were \"very, very striking\". He added: \"It's not just that Edinburgh's figures are extremely low but that the inequality in Edinburgh is extremely high.\"</p>",
  "<p>Brussels has placed itself on a collision course with the Conservative party on the eve of its annual conference by issuing a blunt warning on the dangers of stifling the green agenda.</p> <p>As David Cameron faced pressure from the Tory right to adopt a more confrontational approach to the EU, Europe's environment chief spoke out against critics of environmental regulations for making \"untrue\" claims.</p> <p>Janez Potocnik, the European environment commissioner, told the Guardian that for politicians to suggest that green legislation was a burden was \"very unhelpful, because it is untrue\".</p> <p>\"That rhetoric is missing the point,\" Potocnik said. \"The economy needs the environment, and the environment needs the economy.\"</p> <p>The commissioner, whose comments came after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/21/danny-alexander-stop-tories-trashing-green-agenda\" title=\"\">Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Treasury chief secretary, accused the Tories of waging a \"constant war of attrition\"</a> on green issues, stopped short of naming any Tory ministers.</p> <p>But George Osborne, who announced a slowing of the pace on climate change targets at the Tory conference last year, has repeatedly attacked green regulations as a burden on businesses and warned they would make the UK less competitive than other countries.</p> <p>Potocnik's intervention came as Cameron prepares to reach out to Eurosceptics by outlining in a major speech later this autumn how he will give voters a say, possibly in a referendum, over Britain's relationship with the EU.</p> <p>The prime minister will say that the consent of the people is needed \u2013 probably in the next parliament \u2013 after a new EU treaty is negotiated to introduce greater fiscal co-ordination in the eurozone.</p> <p>Britain will not be part of any new governance arrangements for the eurozone, but it will have a veto in the treaty negotiations, which means the prime minister would attempt to repatriate powers, possibly social and employment laws.</p> <p>Boris Johnson is likely to pile pressure on the prime minister to move faster to recast Britain's relationship with the EU when he makes two speeches at the Tory conference in Birmingham on Monday and Tuesday. David Davis, the former Tory leadership contender, has called for a \"big renegotiation\" of Britain's relationship with the EU.</p> <p>The former Europe minister told the House Magazine: \"The explicit answer to the European issue, whether it's eurozone or the more general European membership issue, is a big renegotiation and multiple referendums. People say now's not the time to negotiate with the Europeans. There's never a right time to bloody negotiate with the Europeans. There's always an excuse.\"</p> <p>The remarks by high-profile eurosceptics show that any intervention by a senior Brussels figure will be sensitive on the eve of the conference. The environment commissioner told the Guardian he was in favour of streamlining regulations. But Potocnik said he did not want to weaken them. \"I'm not saying you should not simplify as much as possible \u2013 that is worthy of attention,\" he said.</p> <p>The commissioner also warned that measures to remove harmful substances from manufacturing, and to curb pollution, climate change and other environmental damage, could not simply be put off indefinitely. \"Don't kill industry with kindness \u2013 if [dealing with such an issue] is unavoidable, then to try to protect an industry from doing so as long as possible makes it a real problem.\"</p> <p>By providing a clear framework for what is acceptable behaviour and what is not, green regulations not only safeguard the public but also help businesses, he said, because they mean that unscrupulous companies cannot undercut conscientious rivals by polluting or falling short of good standards.</p> <p>Potocnik added that dismissing regulations on problems such as pollution and industrial safety would result in more serious problems and higher costs later on. He said: \"When someone talks about the cost of doing something, you should ask about the cost of not doing it.\"</p> <p>Good regulation could save money and foster innovation and new industries in which Europe could take a lead, according to the commissioner. \"I am a firm believer in markets, which will play a crucial role, but we need to have prices [on pollution], taxes and incentives for removing harmful substances, and so on \u2013 to give a clear signal to industry.\"</p> <p>One of the most contentious green issues between the UK and EU has been the failure to meet air pollution targets. London's air has repeatedly breached levels of particulates and other pollutants that can cause breathing difficulties and contribute to ill health and premature deaths. This leaves the government liable for huge fines that could run into hundreds of millions.</p> <p>If the air at pollution monitoring sites contains particulates above a level of 50 micrograms per cubic metre on more than 35 days of the year, the UK will have breached EU standards. London has had a series of extensions since 2005 to allow the government to meet the standards, so far without success.</p> <p>Potocnik warned that the commission would take a hard line on enforcing the regulations. \"That is what we are there to do. We will absolutely be strict \u2013 that is the rule,\" he said. \"And it is how we will contribute to a better life for people.\"</p> <p>He said improving air quality would reduce the burden on health services, help avoid premature deaths and cut the incidence of respiratory problems.</p>",
  "<p>Despite ecstatic reviews from critics at the New York film festival this week, Life of Pi has been met with a curiously grudging response from the assembled ranks of Oscar-ologists and awards-season prognosticators. </p> <p>\"I think that Life of Pi is going to be regarded as a major visual feast by the visual-delight-for-the-sake-of-visual-delight crowd,\" said Jeffrey Wells, of <a href=\"http://hollywood-elsewhere.com/2012/09/pi_oh_my_1.php\">Hollywood Elsewhere</a>, but \"as a non-starter by a significant portion of the family audience \u2026 and as a respectable also-ran in the best picture contest.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\" http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/oscars-life-pi-maybe-feinberg-375151\">Hollywood Reporter</a>'s Scott Feinberg found it \"impeccably crafted\" but, \"while it looks to be a strong below-the-line contender, I'm not sure that I see it contending strongly in the higher-profile categories.\" Fresh from that screening, Indiewire's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/erickohn/status/251740538875809793\">Eric Kohn tweeted</a> \"Pi seems destined for the Hugo slot: F/X-driven, sentimentally involving, respected director.\"<br> Wake up people! Life of Pi is not just a strong contender to make the list of nominees for best picture, but one of the few films that has the potential to go all the way. Here's why: \u2022 <strong>The 3D phenomenon has been dying to crown a king.</strong> Ever since Avatar started the 3D renaissance in 2009, Hollywood has been waiting for someone to enter latest cash cow in a dressage competition. You remember how far Avatar got in the race, only to be felled at the last minute by actors voting bloc, not so much because that they wanted to give acting gongs to The Hurt Locker (they didn't), but because Avatar was perceived to be about cartoon blue people. Last year, too, they showered Hugo with nominations but Scorsese's film, for all its marvel, was a decidedly cold fish to anyone but cinephiles and silent film buffs. \"Too good for kids,\" was one verdict, which pretty much summed up why it failed at the box office.<br> Magical where Hugo was mechanical, Life of Pi comes warmed by Lee's characteristic empathy, tact and sonar-like ability to sound out hidden emotion. The tiger really wants to eat the boy for most of the film: seeing how they broker a peace, without cheating or recourse to anthropomorphism, is the genuine miracle nestled amidst its special effects. \u2022 <strong>It offers Hollywood a flattering image of itself.</strong> A vitally important prerequisite for the best picture winner (and the reason, incidentally, why it will never be a Quentin Tarantino film). For 364 days of the year Hollywood grazes elbows and shins in the mad scramble to put bums on seats, and then, on one day, it puts on a tux and rewards itself for the innovative, artistically daring films it has spent the last year trying not to make. That day is known as the Oscars.<br> Right now, the dominant genre in Hollywood is the \"four-quadrant\" family film with all the technological trimmings. In other words: kids' movies, like this year's Brave, Ice Age: Continental Drift, Madagascar 3, and Dr Seuss the Lorax. Even more than traditional action blockbusters, which play mostly to teenage males, the animated family film is the industry's lifeline right now \u2013 the thing stopping it from sliding into the Pacific ocean. For this, Hollywood is both grateful and guilty. Not many producers, when they started out, saw themselves going in the baby-sitting business. Reared on Godard and the Hollywood New Wave, they still see themselves as iconoclasts, and delight at the prospect of revolution \u2013 as long as it plays. Life of Pi squares that circle. It lends A-list auterist respectability to the main business of Hollywood. It brings redemption to an industry hell-bent on remaking The Smurfs. \u2022 <strong>It offers a bridge between past and future.</strong> The ageing members of the Academy are a backward-looking lot. They love films that evoke Hollywood's past, like The Artist of The King's Speech. At the same time, they are obsessed with tomorrow's tracking numbers and fret endlessly about the future. They see all this technological change going on around them \u2013 digital paint-boxes, motion capture, motion control \u2013 and they want to reward all the effort and artistry, but how can they when what they are looking at, at the end of the day, is a film about blue people, or monkeys taking over San Fransisco.<br> With its Booker-winning literary pedigree and roots in Aesopean fable, Life of Pi offers a reassuring bridge between all this technological whiz-bangery and the kind of classic Hollywood storytelling that gave us The Wizard of Oz or The Jungle Book. A vote for Ang Lee's film is thus more than just a vote for Ang Lee, it is a vote for all those Pixar movies that never quite made best picture, or all those Andy Serkis performances that never found a nomination. This time, all the technology has at its back a Big Theme. \u2022 <strong>It is \"about\" something.</strong> The film celebrates many world religions \u2013 Buddhists, Christians, Muslims, Hindus \u2013 but the casual inclusion of Muslims in that list will play particularly well in Hollywood. Critics will doubtless complain about the slightly saccharine nature of the film's pantheism, and the redundancy of its frame, in which the narrator chews over the spiritual overtones of his tale. But megaphoning your theme \u2013 particularly one as hefty as religious tolerance \u2013 never hurt a film's chances. On the contrary, this is a great example of the kind of misunderstanding between critics and Academy members that leads to shock on Oscar night.<br> \u2022 <strong>Hollywood's growing internationalism.</strong> At no point in its history, save perhaps the silent era, has Hollywood been more international in scope than it is right now, taking over 70% of its profits overseas. That is an industry-changing statistic. And you can see that change at the Academy Awards over the last few years. Think of the 2007's win for Slumdog Millionaire, a British-Indian-American co-production, or The King's Speech, a British film, or last year winner from France, The Artist. \"I'm not American and I'm not French, actually,\" Michel Hazanavicius told the DGA when he accepted his directing award. \"I'm a film-maker.\"<br> Lee has a greater claim as anyone to be at the forefront of this group of global film-makers, which also includes Danny Boyle and James Cameron, who are evolving an international movie grammar for a global audience. Lee's 2000 film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was pretty much the prototype. This not an argument for why anyone will vote for him, merely to point out that he may be on the right side of history. \u2022 <strong>The academy owes him.</strong> After the monumental snub administered to Brokeback Mountain in 2006, when the Academy gave best picture at the last minute to Crash, Lee has been in possession of one of the largest Oscar IOUs since Goodfellas was beaten by Dances with Wolves in 1990. It's worth noting that Lee did gest best director for Brokeback, but Life of Pi is a visual stunner, not the kind of film to split best picture and best director. The IOU pays up in both.<br> \u2022 <strong>The X factor.</strong> When all is said and done, the best picture winner must fulfill on the old promise: show 'em something new. It is here that Life of Pi scores most highly, particularly when placed next to its strongest competitors, all of whom play generically inside the box: Lincoln (historical biopic), Silver Linings Playbook (indie rom-com), Argo (political thriller).</p> <p>Though it contains trace elements of previous pictures \u2013 Slumdog Millionaire, The Jungle Book, Castaway \u2013 Life of Pi feels genuinely sui generis. What is it exactly? A literary adaptation? a children's fable? A 3D movie for all the family? \"I don't get it,\" said one perplexed movie exec told me in the foyer of the New York film festival last week, after the film's debut. \"Who's the audience for this?\"</p> <p>This could, of course, be its downfall. But it's also why I believe that if it wins, it wins big.</p>",
  "<p>Is a belated tightening of measures to stop bovine TB spreading between cattle starting to bear down on the disease in England? That's what the <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/statistics/2012/10/01/monthly-farming-and-food-brief-september-2012/\">latest government data</a> suggests, making the proposed badger cull even more nonsensical than ever.</p> <p>As I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/04/farming-shortcomings-badger-cull-bovine-tb\">revealed on Thursday</a>, frequent and serious lapses in biosecurity were <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/food/fvo/act_getPDF.cfm?PDF_ID=9444\">discovered by European Commission inspectors</a> in September 2011. These \"shortcomings\" included missed targets on both the rapid removal of cattle with TB and the follow-up of missed tests, and \"weaknesses in cleaning and disinfection\" across the industry, all of which increase the risk of TB spreading between cattle.</p> <p>Defra and the NFU pointed out to me that some tightening of the rules and enforcement had taken place following the inspection. So, as Mark Jones from HSI UK, said, why not wait and see how big an impact this has in cutting infections? Furthermore, data from west Wales, which cracked down even sooner, also show falls in TB.</p> <p>Let me be clear: the data so far is provisional over too short a time to be certain that the improved biosecurity is cutting TB in cattle. But you would expect it to and one independent expert told me he anticipated a big impact.</p> <p>Defra says about its <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/statistics/2012/10/01/monthly-farming-and-food-brief-september-2012/\">latest disease data</a>: \"There has been a notable decrease in the incidence rate over the past 6 months, mainly as a result of an increased number of tests on unrestricted herds compared to 2011. The provisional June 2012 incidence rate is 4.2 per cent, compared to 6.0 per cent in June 2011.\" That's a 30% fall.</p> <p>But, Defra adds: \"Care needs to be taken not to read too much into short term figures, especially as this figure includes a number of unclassified incidents. As such, the incidence rates are subject to further revisions as more tests and their results for the period are input.\"</p> <p>At very best, the killing of thousands of badgers over at least four years may cut TB in cattle in hotspots by 12-16%, if the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/19/badger-cull-trial-open-interpretation\">very significant differences</a> between the experimental culls and the actual culls turn out not to be significant after all.</p> <p>So surely a 30% fall in one year is more than enough to warrant postponing the imminent cull.</p> <p>As a footnote, here's a few more revelations from the EC report, which I couldn't squeeze into yesterday's story:</p> <p>\u2022 22% of all new confirmed TB case in cattle are first discovered at slaughterhouses, the anmials having come from \"TB-free\" herds.</p> <p>\u2022 In some cases, milk from diseased cattle was not kept out of the human food chain.</p> <p>\u2022 \"Defra acknowledged there is no practical way to enforce the leaving of [infected] pastures vacant for 60 days on a routine basis.\"</p> <p>\u2022 \"Enforcement of animal disease control policies is fragmented across a number of bodies and weaknesses have been identified, particularly in relation to co-ordination between AHVLA and the local authorities.\" </p> <p>\u2022 \"The delivery of the programme is being undermined at present by resource constraints (particularly in local authorities) ... and inefficiencies caused by the delayed roll out of the new TB software.\"</p>",
  "<p>One of the world's most prominent Catholic theologians has called for a revolution from below to unseat the pope and force radical reform at the Vatican.</p> <p>Hans K\u00fcng is appealing to priests and churchgoers to confront the Catholic hierarchy, which he says is corrupt, lacking credibility and apathetic to the real concerns of the church's members.</p> <p>In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, K\u00fcng, who had close contact with the pope when the two worked together as young theologians, described the church as an \"authoritarian system\" with parallels to Germany's Nazi dictatorship.</p> <p>\"The unconditional obedience demanded of bishops who swear their allegiance to the pope when they make their holy oath is almost as extreme as that of the German generals who were forced to swear an oath of allegiance to Hitler,\" he said.</p> <p>The Vatican made a point of crushing any form of clerical dissent, he added. \"The rules for choosing bishops are so rigid that as soon as candidates emerge who, say, stand up for the pill, or for the ordination of women, they are struck off the list.\" The result was a church of \"yes men\", almost all of whom unquestioningly toed the line.</p> <p>\"The only way for reform is from the bottom up,\" said K\u00fcng, 84, who is a priest. \"The priests and others in positions of responsibility need to stop being so subservient, to organise themselves and say that there are certain things that they simply will not put up with anymore.\"</p> <p>K\u00fcng, the author of around 30 books on Catholic theology, Christianity and ethics, which have sold millions worldwide, said that inspiration for global change was to be found in his native Switzerland and in Austria, where hundreds of Catholic priests have formed movements advocating policies that openly defy current Vatican practices. The revolts have been described as unprecedented by Vatican observers, who say they are likely to cause deep schisms in the church.</p> <p>\"I've always said that if one priest in a diocese is roused, that counts for nothing. Five will create a stir. Fifty are pretty much invincible. In Austria the figure is well over 300, possibly up to 400 priests; in Switzerland it's about 150 who have stood up and it will increase.\"</p> <p>He said recent attempts by the archbishop of Vienna, Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn, to try to stamp out the uprising by threatening to punish those involved in the Austrian \"priests' initiative\" had backfired owing to the strength of feeling. \"He soon stopped when he realised that so many ordinary people are supportive of them and he was in danger of turning them all against him,\" K\u00fcng said.</p> <p>The initiatives support such seemingly modest demands as letting divorced and remarried people receive communion, allowing non-ordained people to lead services and allowing women to take on important positions in the hierarchy. However, as they go against conventional Catholic teaching, the demands have been flatly rejected by the Vatican.</p> <p>K\u00fcng, who was stripped of the authority to teach Catholic theology by Pope John Paul II in 1979 for questioning the concept of papal infallibility, is credited with giving the present pope, Joseph Ratzinger as he then was, the first significant step up the hierarchy of Catholic academia when he called him to T\u00fcbingen University, in south-west Germany, as professor of dogmatic theology in 1966.</p> <p>The pair had worked closely for four years in the 1960s as the youngest theological advisers on the second Vatican council \u2013 the most radical overhaul of the Catholic church since the middle ages. But the relationship between the two was never straightforward, with their political differences eventually driving a wedge between them. The dashing and flamboyant Hans K\u00fcng, by various accounts, often stole the limelight from the more earnest and staid Joseph Ratzinger.</p> <p>K\u00fcng refers to the \"heap of legends\" that abound about himself and Ratzinger from their \"T\u00fcbingen days\", not least the apocryphal accounts of how he gave lifts in his \"red sports car\" to the bicycle-riding Ratzinger.</p> <p>\"I often gave him a lift, particularly up the steep hills of T\u00fcbingen, yes, but too much has been made of this,\" he said. \"I didn't drive a sports car, rather an Alfa Romeo Giulia. Ratzinger admitted himself that he had no interest in technology and had no driving licence. But it's often been turned into some kind of pseudo-profound metaphor idealising the 'cyclist' and demonising the 'Alfa Romeo driver'.\"</p> <p>Indeed the \"modest'' and prudent \"bicycle-rider'' image that pope-to-be, now 85, fostered for years has all but evaporated since his 2005 inauguration, according to K\u00fcng.</p> <p>\"He has developed a peculiar pomposity that doesn't fit the man I and others knew, who once walked around in a Basque-style cap and was relatively modest. Now he's frequently to be seen wrapped in golden splendour and swank. By his own volition he wears the crown of a 19th-century pope, and has even had the garments of the Medici pope Leo X remade for him.\"</p> <p>That \"pomposity\", he said, manifested itself most fully in the regular audiences who gather on St Peter's Square in Rome. \"What happens has Potemkin village dimensions,\" he said. \"Fanatical people go there to celebrate the pope, and tell him how wonderful he is, while meanwhile at home their own parishes are in a lamentable state, with a lack of priests, a far higher number than ever before of people who are leaving than are being baptised and now Vatileaks, which indicates just what a poor state the Vatican administration is in,\" he said, referring to the scandal over leaked documents uncovering power struggles within the Vatican which has seen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/29/pope-former-butler-trial-theft\" title=\"\">the pope's former butler appear in court.</a> The trial ends on Saturday.</p> <p>It was in T\u00fcbingen that the paths of the two theologians crossed for several years before diverging sharply following the student riots of 1968. Ratzinger was shocked by the events and escaped to the relative safety of his native Bavaria, where he deepened his involvement in the Catholic hierarchy. K\u00fcng stayed in T\u00fcbingen and increasingly assumed the role of the Catholic church's enfant terrible.</p> <p>\"The student revolts were a primal shock for Ratzinger and after that he became ever more conservative and part of the hierarchy of the church,\" said K\u00fcng.</p> <p>Calling Pope Benedict XVI's reign a \"pontificate of missed opportunities\", in which he had forgone chances to reconcile with the Protestant, Jewish, orthodox and Muslim faiths, as well as failing to help the African fight against Aids by not allowing the use of birth control, K\u00fcng said his \"gravest scandal\" was the way he had \"covered up\" worldwide cases of sexual crimes committed by clerics during his time as the head of the Roman Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith as Cardinal Ratzinger.</p> <p>\"The Vatican is no different from the Kremlin,\" K\u00fcng said. \"Just as Putin as a secret service agent became the head of Russia, so Ratzinger, as head of the Catholic church's secret services, became head of the Vatican. He has never apologised for the fact that many cases of abuse were sealed under the <em>secretum pontificium </em>(papal secrecy), or acknowledged that this is a disaster for the Catholic church.\" K\u00fcng described a process of \"Putinisation\" that has taken place at the Vatican.</p> <p>Yet despite their differences, the two have remained in contact. K\u00fcng visited the pope at his summer retreat, Castel Gandolfo, in 2005, during which the two held an intensive four-hour discussion.</p> <p>\"It felt like we were on an equal footing \u2013 after all, we'd been colleagues for years. We walked through the park and there were times I thought he might turn the corner on certain issues, but it never happened. Since then we've still kept exchanging letters, but we've not met.\"</p> <p>Kung has travelled widely in his life, befriending everyone from Iranian leaders to John F. Kennedy, and Tony Blair with whom he forged close links a decade ago, becoming something of a spiritual guru for the then British prime minister ahead of his decision to convert to Catholicism.</p> <p>\"I was impressed how he tackled the Northern Ireland conflict. But then came the Iraq war and I was extremely troubled by the way in which he collaborated with Bush. I wrote to him calling it a historical failure of the first order. He wrote me a hand-written note in reply, saying he respected my views and thankyou, but that I should know he was acting according to his conscience and was not trying to please the Americans. I was astounded that a British prime minister could make such a catastrophic mistake, and he remains for me a tragic figure.\" He described Blair's conversion to Catholicism as a mistake, insisting he should instead have used his role as a public figure to reconcile differences between the Anglican and Catholic churches in the UK.</p> <p>From his book-filled study, where a portrait of Sir Thomas More, the 16th-century English Catholic martyr, hangs on the wall, K\u00fcng looks out on to his front garden and a two-metre-tall statue of himself. Critics have called it symptomatic of Kung's inflated sense of his own importance. He is embarrassed as he attempts to explain how it was a gift from his 20-year-old Stiftung Weltethos, (Foundation for a Global Ethic), which operates from his house and will continue to do so after his death.</p> <p>Far from putting the brakes on his prolific theological output, K\u00fcng has recently distilled the ideas of Weltethos \u2013 which seeks to create a global code of behaviour, or a globalisation of ethics \u2013 into a capricious musical libretto. Mixing narrative with excerpts from the teachings of Confucianism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Islam and Christianity, K\u00fcng's writings have been incorporated into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/22/weltethos-review\" title=\"\">a major symphonic work by the British composer Jonathan Harvey</a> that will have its London premiere on Sunday at the Southbank Centre.</p> <p>K\u00fcng says the musical work, like the foundation, is an attempt to emphasise what the religions of the world have in common rather than what divides them.</p> <p>Weltethos was founded in the early 1990s as an attempt to bring the religions of the world together by emphasising what they have in common rather than what divides them. It has drawn up a code of behavioural rules that it hopes one day will be as universally acceptable as the UN.</p> <p>The work's aim is arguably high-minded \u2013 Harvey described the demanding task of writing a score for the text as an \"awe-inspring responsibility\". But K\u00fcng, who has won the support of leading figures including Henry Kissinger, Kofi Annan, Jacques Rogge, Desmond Tutu, Mary Robinson and Shirin Ebadi, insisted its aims were grounded in basic necessity.\"At a time of paradigm change in the world, we need a common set of principles, most obvious among them the Golden Rule, in which Confucius taught to not impose on others what you do not wish for yourself,\" he said.</p> <p><em>Weltethos will be </em><a href=\"http://ticketing.southbankcentre.co.uk/find/music/classical/tickets/harvey-weltethos-66469\" title=\"\"><em>performed at the Royal Festival Hall</em></a><em> </em>on October 7</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama's hopes of holding on to the White House have received a major boost from new figures showing that the US unemployment rate has dropped below 8% for the first time since he took office in January 2009.</p> <p>The US added 114,000 new jobs in September, in line with expectations. But August's disappointing jobs figure was dramatically revised upwards from 96,000 to 142,000, helping to bring the unemployment rate down to 7.8%.</p> <p>\"Today, I believe that as a nation we are moving forward again,\" Obama told a raucous campaign rally in Fairfax, Virginia, on Friday a few hours after the figures were published. \"This morning, we found out that the unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since I took office.\"</p> <p>Acknowledging that the economy was not out of the woods yet, he added: \"Now, every month's figures reminds us that we have still got too many of our friends and neighbours struggling to pay the bills ... But now is certainly not the time to talk down the economy and score a few political points. It's a reminder that this country has come too far too turn back now.\"</p> <p>Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG, described the report as \"pretty darn good\". Greenhaus highlighted the fact that the total number of employed persons rose by \"a whopping\" 873,000 while the number of unemployed persons declined by 456,000, the largest increase in employment since January 2003.</p> <p>The news could not have been better timed for Obama, whose re-election campaign has been rattled in recent days by his perceived weak performance in his first debate with rival Mitt Romney. The report contained good news for many voters in key demographics being targeted ahead of the election.</p> <p>The unemployment rates for adult men is now 7.3%, for adult women it was 7%. But problems remain. September's unemployment rate for teenagers was 23.7% and there was little change for black Americans (13.4%) or Hispanics (9.9%).</p> <p>The number of people working part time because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job rose from 8 million in August to 8.6 million in September.</p> <p>\"This is not what a real recovery looks like,\" Romney said in a statement. \"We created fewer jobs in September than in August, and fewer jobs in August than in July, and we've lost over 600,000 manufacturing jobs since president Obama took office.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The results of President Obama's failed policies are staggering \u2013 23 million Americans struggling for work, nearly one in six living in poverty and 47 million people dependent on food stamps to feed themselves and their families.</p> <p>The Republican House speaker John Boehner also noted the figures are too high but, unusually, acknowledged there was some good news too. \"While there is positive news in today's report, job creation is far too slow and the unemployment rate is far too high.\"</p> <p>Conservative business guru Jack Welch, former boss of General Electric, went as far as accusing the Bureau of Labor Statistics of cooking the books. \"Unbelievable jobs numbers\u2026 these Chicago guys will do anything..can't debate so change numbers,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack_welch/statuses/254198154260525057\">he said on Twitter</a>. </p> <p>Labor secretary Hilda Solis immediately hit back at claims that the Obama administration might have skewed the jobs numbers. \"I'm insulted when I hear that because we have a very professional civil service,\" Solis told CNBC.</p> <p>The monthly jobs report has become a political hotspot on the 2012 election. Last month's disappointing figures came as the Democrat's wrapped up their convention in Charlotte. \"If last night was the party, this morning is the hangover,\" Romney said in a statement at the time.</p> <p>The final monthly jobs report of the campaign will come just days before the election on 6 November.</p> <p>While Obama can now point to 24 consecutive months of growth, the Republicans argue the rate remains historically weak. An increase of 114,000 barely covers population growth in the US as new entrants come into the job market.</p> <p>Geoff Hoffmann of recruitment firm DHR International said employers were growing increasingly confident but a lot of uncertainty remained.</p> <p>\"There's uncertainty about the impact of healthcare legislation, tax impacts, it's not really clear what is going to happen in 2013 and beyond,\" he said.</p> <p>Hoffmann said recovery was taking place in industries like technology, life sciences and that consumer and retail recruitment were doing \"surprisingly well\". But industries like financial services were still lagging after the financial crisis.</p> <p>Greenhaus said the report was \"95% better than expected\" but warned that slow growth could still come back to bite the recovery in the jobs market. The US recently cut its forecasts for gross domestic product \u2013 the widest measure of economic growth - after a sharp fall in manufacturing orders. \"You can't have jobs growth without economic growth,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Time for our weekly roundup of the best new Android apps, covering smartphone and tablet apps available through the Google Play store.</p> <p>As ever, games are not included, as there is a separate weekly post for new mobile and tablet games. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/oct/04/best-iphone-android-windows-phone-games\">The latest one</a> has a number of Android games, including NBA 2K13, Jetpack Joyride, Beastie Bay, Rayman Jungle Run and Sony's PlayStation Mobile client.</p> <p>The weekly Best iPhone and iPad Apps post <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/oct/05/best-iphone-ipad-apps-blue-note-radioplayer\">has also now been published</a>. For now, here are the 20 most notable new Android apps from the last seven days:</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tomtom.ukireland\">TomTom UK &amp; Ireland</a></h2> <p>It's taken a while, but TomTom has brought its UK &amp; Ireland navigation app to Android \u2013&#xa0;along with a range of other territories as separate downloads. Features include offline maps, traffic data, camera alerts and the promise of at least four mapping updates a year to keep the data current. Some popular smartphones aren't supported at launch though, including Samsung's Galaxy S III.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bbc.gfrtact\">BBC Good Food \u2013&#xa0;Recipes</a></h2> <p>BBC Worldwide has brought its Good Food cookbook collection to Android, with this free app acting as the container for a series of themed recipe collections. They're bought via in-app purchase, with themes including Healthy, Quick, One-pot, Cake and Festive.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xero.touch\">Xero</a></h2> <p>Can accounting software be \"beautiful\"? Xero says it can, and is aiming to prove it with the company's new Android app. It runs the gamut of accountancy tasks for small and medium-sized businesses, from bank balances and invoicing to receipts and expense claims. The data is encrypted and stored on Xero's servers for security purposes.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hubbl\">Hubbl</a></h2> <p>App discovery has improved greatly on the Google Play store (formerly Android Market) over the last couple of years, but as on iOS, there is always room for inventive discovery apps by third parties. Sol Studios' Hubbl is the latest, using social features and hashtags to suggest likely downloads, as well as riffing off its telescope-inspired name with a \"SkyView for Apps\" feature: point your phone at the sky to see some recommendations.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mila.android\">Mila</a></h2> <p>Mila styles itself as a \"smart business assistant\" for small companies, with features including invoicing and e-commerce catalogue management. But the app is also pro-active in finding new leads, scanning Twitter and identifying potential customers based on what you're selling.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iojess.conjure\">Conjure</a></h2> <p>Experienced Android users know the value of a good launcher app, customising the handset's home screen. Conjure is picking up some buzz with its promise of being the \"fastest, smartest launcher\" for Google-powered devices, from apps and contacts through to web searches and toggling various connectivity and volume modes.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bbs.digitas.wonderbra\">Wonderbra Decoder</a></h2> <p>\"Some things really need to be kept between us girls, right?\" notes the Google Play description of this bra-brand app. Those things being QR codes, seemingly. The app lets you scan codes on Wonderbra's latest round of adverts to digitally remove model Adriana Cernanova's clothes and examine her lingerie. Then buy it, obviously. It also works with the brand's new YouTube advert.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aol.mobile.aolon\">AOL On</a></h2> <p>AOL's new Android app is US-only for the moment. It's an online videos aggregator, pulling in videos in a range of categories and sorting them into channels, as well as AOL's own stable of video shows like Home of the Brave or Fetching. It's free and ad-supported.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aqsmartphone.android.fordcpp.ui\">MyFord Mobile</a></h2> <p>This is a niche, for now, but it shows the way automotive firms like Ford are thinking when it comes to their new cars. The app is for Ford's planned electric vehicles, helping owners check the charging status of their car, set the cabin temperature and find charging stations. It also calculates the cheapest time to charge the car, based on owners' electricity rates.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.polkastmusic\">Polkast Music</a></h2> <p>iOS users have Apple's iTunes Match as a cloud storage music service, but Polkast Music is the latest attempt to connect Android devices and iTunes music collections (see also: AirSync by DoubleTwist). Polkast Music doesn't store your songs in the cloud; it wirelessly plays songs from your computer's iTunes library on your Android device, cacheing songs as it goes for offline listening. It requires a companion app to be running on the computer.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kliqmobile\">Kliq</a></h2> <p>US startup Kliq was one of the companies plying its wares at the Silicon Valley DEMO conference earlier in the month. It's a tool for helping people import contacts from different social networks (including Facebook, Twitter and Google+) into \"cliques\" for more targeted sharing. An interesting idea, although it's clearly early days.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.showtime.showtimeanytime\">Showtime Anytime</a></h2> <p>I recently wrote about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/sep/19/bbc-media-player-iplayer-android\">some of the reasons</a> British broadcasters bring their TV-on-demand apps to Android later than iOS. In the US, networks are also turning their attention to supporting Android, as seen in the new Showtime Anywhere app. It provides streaming access to shows including Dexter, Homeland, Shameless and Weeds.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sierratradingpost.android\">Sierra Trading Post</a></h2> <p>Another app for American Android users, this is retailer Sierra Trading Post's official ecommerce app, promising exclusive deals and discounts, mobile coupons, and a shopping cart that runs across smartphone, tablet and desktop versions of the store.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.connectib.spar\">SPAR</a></h2> <p>British retailers are getting in on the Android app action too. This app from SPAR is all about the offers: \"Select, download and redeem exclusive mobile offers from your nearest store.\" News and recipes are thrown in for good measure, although for now the app is \"in pilot phase\", so only a selection of stores are supporting it.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cube.arc.efa\">Earthquake -American Red Cross</a></h2> <p>Another US-focused app for the road, this time from the American Red Cross charity. It's aimed at people who live in earthquake-prone areas, with instructions on what to do in the event of a quake; features to let friends and family know you're safe; and data from the United States Geological survey on the magnitude and closeness of the quake.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.pieminister\">Pieminister</a></h2> <p>Pies! If ever an app lent itself to a one-word review (with punctuation) it's this one, for British pie-tailer Pieminister. It's also the first app ever covered in this column to include the phrase \"augmented pastry reality\" in its Google Play store description. If you've guessed that means scanning packaging to get serving suggestions, jokes and a song, you'd be right.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.applabs.mandm\">Maddie and Matt Values App</a></h2> <p>\"Polite and courteous children\"? It's the unattainable dream for many parents, but this Android app aims to help. It wants to teach children good behaviour in 26 letter-shaped scenarios, with stories and interactivity to lighten the educational aspects.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doubletrouble.saywhatfree\">Say What?!</a></h2> <p>\"All these e-commerce, accounting and branded apps are very well,\" you may be thinking. \"But where is the app that will translate my text messages into pirate language?\" That would be Double Trouble's Say What?!, which translates messages into a range of novelty languages, while also promising to \"make sense of LOLspeak\" in texts from The Kids.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sgninc.treater\">Treater \u2013&#xa0;Send Real Treats</a></h2> <p>The last US-only app of this week's roundup, Treater is an app for sending real gifts to Facebook friends. Said gifts including beers, cupcakes, film tickets, smoothies and coffees. The treats are delivered as virtual gift cards on the friend's smartphone, and can then be redeemed in participating stores. An interesting idea, although Facebook is <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/about/gifts\">working on its own version of this</a>.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appsontoast.petpal\">Pet Pal - Pet Manager</a></h2> <p>\"All these turning-my-texts-into-piratespeak apps are very well,\" you may be thinking. \"But where is the app that lets me organise my pets?\" Meet Pet Pal. It's actually sensible rather than silly, providing a handy mobile way to store details on animals, as well as reminders (e.g. vet visits, worming) and some photo-storage features.</p> <p>That's our selection, but what have you been using on your Android device this week? Make your recommendations, or give feedback on the apps above, by posting a comment.</p>",
  "<p>It's heartening to see Friday's news that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2012/oct/05/us-jobs-report-politics-live\">unemployment rate edged down to 7.8% last month</a>. But let's not get too caught up in celebrations. We need to look beyond the sheer <em>quantity</em> of jobs being created and into the <em>quality</em> of those jobs \u2013 something neither presidential candidate seems very interested in talking about.</p> <p>Buried in the Friday's jobs report is evidence that a disturbing trend continues: the creation of more part-time jobs, many of them low-wage, taking the place of solid middle-class careers. Positions in sectors like manufacturing continued to decline last month, replaced by new jobs in the healthcare, warehousing and retail industries. A lot of these jobs don't allow workers to rack up enough hours to earn healthcare benefits \u2013 let alone break out of poverty.</p> <p>The key data in the new report can be found in a table called \"A-8\". It shows that more workers are in stuck in part-time jobs because their hours were cut back or they're unable to find full-time positions. The number of workers in this category shot up to <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t08.htm\">8.5 million in September</a> \u2013 an increase of 581,000 from last month. This month's figure is nearly double what it was in September 2007, the eve of the recession. </p> <p>It's distressing to think that after 20th-century labor struggles won the battle for the <a href=\"http://www.americanrightsatwork.org/component/option,com_issues/Itemid,366/view,issue/id,12/\">40-hour work week</a>, the 21st-century struggle is a fight for enough working hours to make a living wage. That's not what I'd call progress.</p> <p>Here's another sobering number: since September 2007, the number of Americans working full-time has declined by about 5.9 million, while the number working part-time jobs has increased by 2.6 million. (The blog <a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2012/05-2/Full%20vs%20Part%20Time%20May_1.jpg\">Zero Hedge drew up this powerful graph</a> in June to illustrate the trend.) During the recovery, job gains have been concentrated in lower-wage occupations, which grew nearly three times as fast as mid-wage and higher-wage occupations, <a href=\"http://www.nelp.org/index.php/content/content_about_us/tracking_the_recovery_after_the_great_recession\">according to a recent study</a> by the National Employment Law Project. </p> <p>The growth of part-time and temporary work is usually a leading indicator \u2013 meaning, a sign that the job market is beginning to heal. But we've reached nearly five years after <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2008/12/01/news/economy/recession/index.htm\">the recession officially hit</a>, and it's time to face the fact that these employment trends are more structural than cyclical.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.adjunctnation.com/2012/07/10/part-time-faculty-union-prez-publishes-op-ed-calling-his-own-members-monsters/\">From academia</a> to the retail sector, from government to warehouse work, employers are less and less committal when it comes to their workers. Offering part-time work \u2013 or even full-time jobs <a href=\"http://www.dol.gov/whd/workers/misclassification/\">masquerading as freelance gigs</a> \u2013 allows companies to offer stingier benefits packages or none at all. Those in low-wage or minimum-wage jobs often have no retirement security or health insurance. That means relying on Medicaid or even emergency room visits for illness or accidents \u2013 causing stress on workers and shifting costs from employers to taxpayers. </p> <p>Benefits aren't the only problem. Workers desperate to work full time now may also be sentenced to a lower-wage fate in the future. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/business/26work.html?pagewanted=all\">According to a recent study by the Johns Hopkins Institute for Policy Studies</a>, women who work in part-time jobs have fewer training opportunities and are less able to advance and increase their pay over time. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/ooh/about/projections-overview.htm\">Job growth projections show</a> that we can expect the trend to continue. The healthcare and social assistance sector is expected to add the most jobs by 2020, with retail close behind, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Large segments of both industries are notorious for low-wage and precarious work. Home care workers, for example, lack minimum-wage and overtime protections, while the retail trade has faced hundreds of lawsuits for wage theft. </p> <p>In the retail sector, employers increasingly want an on-call workforce that they can hire when demand is high and ignore when business is slower. Workers at companies like Walmart are reportedly <a href=\"#.UG41uhj-D-Y\">\"fighting for hours\"</a> at their stores, patching together irregular schedules for meager paychecks.</p> <p>Of course, access to fewer hours at one job means hustling for more shifts at another. About 6.9 million Americans were working multiple jobs in September, according to Friday's jobs report. No wonder a large chunk of our <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-57422902-10391704/41-million-american-workers-dont-get-enough-sleep-cdc-says/\">workforce isn't getting enough sleep</a>. </p> <p>Continuing on this path means becoming an ever more precarious, part-time nation when it comes to our working lives. But solutions to the part-time problem aren't easy to come by. Many companies are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/02/us-jobs-corporate-cash-hoarders\">loath to create good jobs</a> in an uncertain economic climate, and it's cheaper and less risky to take people on part-time. </p> <p>The irony is that companies seeking to cut costs are sabotaging their own bottom lines by offering unsteady employment. People working part-time involuntarily have less money to spend on goods and services, and are less able to stimulate the economy. It's a vicious cycle. Short of another economic boom that tightens the labor market, the only hope is organizing for better conditions in the workplace and the political arena. </p> <p>Workers seeking more steady employment could join allies in campaigns for <a href=\"familyvaluesatwork.org\">earned sick days</a> or <a href=\"http://www.domesticworkers.org/\">home care workers' rights</a> to push for new protections. They could propose that part-time workers earn the same hourly pay as their full-time counterparts, and pro-rated benefits, as they do in many developed countries. </p> <p>Winning these kinds of rights would be a heavy lift in a political environment obsessed with job quantity instead of quality.

They suffered what their <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/16/mau-mau-veterans-secret-documents\" title=\"\">lawyers describe as \"unspeakable acts of brutality\"</a>, including castration, beatings and severe sexual assaults.</p> <p>After the ruling, the Foreign Office acknowledged it had \"potentially significant and far reaching legal implications\", and said it was planning to appeal.</p> <p>However, an estimated 2,000 other Kenyans \u2013 the survivors of more than 70,000 Mau Mau suspects who were imprisoned during the seven-year insurgency in the 1950s \u2013 are now expected to come forward to sue the British government.</p> <p>Many more men and women around the world who were imprisoned and allegedly mistreated during the conflicts that often accompanied the British retreat from empire may also be considering claims.

  "<p>Patrick Lauruol had become dishearteningly used to having his bike stolen, despite taking sensible precautions. However, when returned to his mid-range mountain bike, left locked in a busy spot near Finsbury Park, he was surprised to find half a bike:</p> <blockquote> \"Someone had cut through the cables which link the brake and gear levers to the rest of the bike, unscrewed the quill stem (which attaches the handlebars to bike's frame) and made off with the handlebars and levers. The rest of the bike \u2013 including the lock \u2013 was intact.\" </blockquote> <p>Patrick, who was insured with <a href=\"https://www.eta.co.uk/insurance/cycle\" title=\"\">ETA</a>, was able to claim on his policy after paying his \u00a325 excess. Had he not been insured, he estimates that replacement parts would have cost him more than \u00a3300.</p> <p>Insurer ETA, which provides cover for bicycles including stolen parts, believes that this kind of theft is increasing. Their data shows the number of claims policyholders made for stolen bike parts doubled between 2010 and 2011. Figures for 2012 are incomplete but theft of parts, rather than whole bikes remains prevalent.</p> <p>The value of claims has also risen dramatically during the same period. In 2010, the average claim made following the theft of bike parts was \u00a3143, rising to \u00a3213 in 2011. In 2012 the figure appears to have increased further to more than \u00a3300. The largest payout was for \u00a31,290, where a thief had stripped a bike of its suspension forks, handlebars, front and rear disc brakes and levers.</p> <p>Yannick Read, spokesperson for ETA, says bike parts are particularly appealing for thieves: \"When you next park your bicycle, count the number of easily removable components and accessories on neighbouring bikes and you'll get an idea of the haul a thief can expect from a single bike rack. If your bike is insured, it's important to check the wording: we cover every standard component on the bike against theft including those attached with quick-release clamps, but as you'd expect, cover varies between providers.\"</p> <p>Chris Juden, senior technical officer at the national cycling charity, CTC, agrees that this kind of theft poses a serious problem for cyclists: \"It is certainly true that thieves can strip a bike of most its components equipped only with allen keys in the space of just a few minutes. Components attached with quick releases can go missing even quicker. Unfortunately, you might need to think about whether you really need to ride your top-of-the-range bike when commuting or whether you'd be better off riding an old bike about town. Better still, find out if indoor cycle parking at work is an option. Some say that it's worth parking in a well-lit place, but I'm not convinced: there are plenty of examples on YouTube of bikes being nicked in broad daylight in busy streets.\"</p> <p>Other victims of cycle theft are doing what they can to address the problem. On his slightly Herculean daily commute from Cobham to central London, Patrick Wells became exasperated after his bike's parts were frequently stolen. Cycling 20 miles with no saddle is not much fun, but, not one to take it on the chin, Wells started a company: <a href=\"http://www.atomic22.com/\" title=\"\">Atomic22</a> now manufactures fasteners that are virtually impossible to unlock without a unique tool.</p> <p>He says:</p> <blockquote> \"It's not hard to see why this kind of theft has become such a problem: bike parts can easily be worth hundreds (and in extreme cases, thousands) of pounds and are dishearteningly easy to steal. Worst still, parts are easy to sell on. While frames can be tracked, handlebars, saddles and even cranks are usually impossible to trace.\" </blockquote> <p>The Cycle Task Force, a dedicated unit to improve cycle security in London, recommends that cyclists mark and register their bike parts so that they can be traced more easily if stolen and <a href=\"http://content.met.police.uk/Article/Cycle-marking-events/1400005859885/1400005859885\" title=\"\">offers free marking events in London</a>.</p>",

  "<p>We're now several weeks into <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/\">Coursera</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun\">Functional Programming Principles in Scala</a> course and thought it was time to update you on our progress so far. The developers here at the Guardian are still very excited about the course, especially now that it's started to pick up pace. This week in particular, the course has moved on from basic programming concepts, with week three introducing data and abstraction via Scala's unique synthesis of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming\">functional</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming\">object oriented</a> programming paradigms.</p> <p>Weeks one and two saw <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion\">recursion</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory\">set theory</a>, which course instructor <a href=\"http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky/\">Martin Odersky</a> demonstrated with some mathematical examples. While this is a joy for those who love nothing better than pondering abstract data structures and logical quantifiers, those who signed up for the course to improve their web development skills using <a href=\"http://www.scala-lang.org/\">Scala</a> may have found this high level of abstraction so early on to be fairly off-putting. Examples based on more familiar grounds can be more compelling, particularly for anyone new to programming or without a background in mathematics.</p> <p>The other main gripe we've heard from others taking the course is that the earlier assignments often had very little to do with the corresponding lecture material. It's almost as if there were two wholly distinct sides to the course. First we learn programming principles from Odersky's excellent videos and the included exercises, and then we solve a set of challenging and interesting \u2013 if irrelevant \u2013 computer science problems. While both of these facets are enjoyable, we found ourselves hoping for a bit more focus.</p> <p>Fortunately, week three's exercises represent a clear shift towards more tangible concepts with concrete examples that make clear use of the concepts we've been learning. With this knowledge, we now have all of the pieces we need to start writing larger programs. This week's assignment incorporates the recursion and set theory introduced in the first two weeks into a program that analyses trending tweets from popular tech blogs. While this assignment deals with Twitter, the same principles are at play regardless of the type of information being manipulated, nicely demonstrating how the abstract theories introduced earlier in the course can be applied to the problems programmers face in their day-to-day work.</p> <p>Having started work at the Guardian without any experience in Scala, we both feel that this course would be a fantastic introduction to the language. As well as covering functional programming principles (the unfamiliarity of which often causes a lot of the problems beginners have with Scala), it has now begun to cover the language itself. For anybody thinking about learning Scala, this course is an excellent way to get started. Having a good understanding of just a couple of core principles makes interpreting Scala codebases much less intimidating, and encourages a particular way of thinking when it comes to writing the language.</p> <p>If you've found the first few weeks hard going, it's well worth persevering through the abstract concepts introduced at the beginning of the course. Getting familiar with recursion and reasoning about higher order data abstraction can change the way you approach programming problems, which can have benefits well beyond this course, and even Scala itself. As the course continues, we suspect we'll see more and more applications of these concepts.</p>",

  "<p>The world No 1, Magnus Carlsen, 21, has encountered a surprise check in his hitherto smooth advance towards Garry Kasparov's all-time high rating. A serious rival of his own age has suddenly emerged and they will meet on Monday afternoon in a critical test for both.</p> <p>The Grand Slam final in S\u00e3o Paulo and Bilbao should have been a three-way fight among Carlsen, Armenia's world No2, Levon Aronian, and India's veteran world champion, Vishy Anand. Anand's play has been lacklustre for many months, and he drew all his five games in the S\u00e3o Paulo half.</p> <p>But the eminent trio were all upstaged by Fabiano Caruana, 20. Italy's rising star beat Carlsen in the very first round, won the best game of the event by an impressive double exchange offer, survived a lost position against Aronian and led the field going into next week's Bilbao stage.</p> <p>Caruana is the most dedicated and hard-working of all the top grandmasters, playing with hardly a break and surging to No5 in the rankings. He was close to a major success at Moscow's Tal Memorial before Carlsen passed him in the final round. The Norwegian is contrastingly relaxed and even lazy between tournaments, undertaking modelling and other media work, and indulging his passion for soccer and skiing. But during events he is focused, determined and maximalist, with a special reputation for grinding down rivals in marathon endgames.If Caruana can stay in front at Bilbao and win the Grand Slam, it will be a blow to Carlsen's legend of invincibility and will mark a real power shift at the top of world chess.</p> <p>Hence the importance of Monday's Carlsen v Caruana pairing at Bilbao, where the Norwegian will have the white pieces and where the tournament standings impel him to go flat out for victory.</p> <p>The game will start at 4pm BST and the best place to follow it live is on chessbomb.com, a free site which provides move-by-move computer analysis and outspoken audience comments.</p> <p>Before Caruana's game with Russia's best young GM Sergey Karjakin, 22, the Italian predicted the opening and even had the position after Black's 18th on his analysis board beforehand. White started to slip by 21 a4 (21 axb4 and Ra1) then erred by 23 Qd1? (23 Rc2 and Rbc1). Black's 23...Ba6! was a strategic crusher, giving Black's B a fine diagonal or leaving White's e4 pawn weak if the Bs are exchanged. The masterly double exchange sac 27...Rxe4! and 30...Rxe3! gave Black's Q and Bs total control. After that White had no defence, eg 32 Qg2 Nf4 or later 35 Ne5 Qxe5+ 36 Kh1 Be4+.

  "<p>At this week's Labour Party Conference in Manchester, Ed Miliband, the UK opposition leader, said the time had come to tackle abuses of worker rights. He pledged to \"crack down on employers who don't pay the minimum wage\" and to \"end the shady practices, in the construction industry and elsewhere, of gangmasters\" if he came to power.</p> <p>These are welcome commitments and should be seen as non-partisan issues. Foreign minister William Hague has taken important steps to make the broader business and human rights agenda a <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/global-issues/human-rights/international-framework/business/\" title=\"\">permanent commitment of the UK Government</a>. Yet these critical issues still don't receive the attention they deserve on the national agenda.</p> <p>It is now over eight years since 23 Chinese workers drowned in Morecambe Bay while picking cockles, prompting many to look again at the underside of employment practices in the UK. The UK <a href=\"http://www.gla.defra.gov.uk\" title=\"\">Gangmasters Licensing Authority</a> (GLA), founded shortly after the Morecambe Bay incident, mobilises a range of political, business, trade union and civil society interests. Together, they seek to protect some of the UK's most vulnerable workers, migrant and non-migrant, in horticulture, agriculture, shellfish gathering and forestry. Any employment agency, labour provider or gangmaster providing workers for these sectors in the UK needs a licence. The GLA, formed under the previous government, has been maintained by the current coalition government. However, there is still no equivalent for the construction sector \u2013 or for other sectors where workers remain highly vulnerable to exploitation.</p> <p>There are issues, for example, in the hotel and catering sector \u2013 a point picked up by BBC Newsnight last week in two reports revealing the exploitation of agency staff at top London hotels. The <a href=\"http://www.ihrb.org\" title=\"\">Institute for Human Rights and Business</a> (IHRB), together with the <a href=\"http://www.antislavery.org/english/\" title=\"\">Anti-Slavery International</a>, has called for greater protection for workers in this sector through the <a href=\"http://www.staff-wanted.org\" title=\"\">Staff Wanted Initiative</a> and for hotels to undertake greater due diligence of all third parties through which they subcontract.</p> <p>Before the London Olympics, the IHRB distributed leaflets to all 1,500 hotels in the Greater London Area providing practical advice for ensuring ethical and legal standards were maintained in the recruitment and employment of staff, including those supplied by agencies. Some action is being undertaken, such as that by the <a href=\"http://www.tourismpartnership.org/\" title=\"\">International Tourism Partnership</a> and some major hotel chains, but the industry needs to take far more responsibility for the business model it operates, which leaves its reputation at risk and its workforce vulnerable to exploitation.</p> <p>The Metropolitan Police, who are increasingly finding a crossover between labour exploitation and other forms of criminality, have endorsed the Staff Wanted Initiative. It now appears on the Police Knowledge Database used by all police forces in the UK. Early day motion 276 of the 2012/13 session of the UK parliament, which explicitly references the initiative, has so far attracted cross-party support, and there is interest from key government departments in the steps that can be taken to combat trafficking and forced labour.</p> <p>In December 2012, the European Commission will launch its draft guidance to employment and recruitment agencies operating worldwide, and two other business sectors, on how best to implement the <a href=\"http://www.business-humanrights.org/SpecialRepPortal/Home/Protect-Respect-Remedy-Framework/GuidingPrinciples\" title=\"\">United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights</a>. It is important that all those who support the recruitment and employment industry, but also want to see better standards for ensuring that bottom feeders do not exploit workers, engage in this process. For example, they can comment on the draft guidance, the result of a multistakeholder process involving industry actors, civil society, UN agencies and other experts.</p> <p>The UK is not immune to even the worst forms of human rights abuse, such as forced labour and trafficking. But often the greatest risks will lie elsewhere in the world, possibly in the supply chains of many companies or even within a government's own purchasing practices. Last week, President Obama announced a new US executive order strengthening protections in US public procurement in order to fight human trafficking worldwide \u2013 specifically related to cross-border recruitment activities. We must hope that we will soon see similar approaches in the UK: ensuring the way government uses its own purchasing power aligns fully with international human rights standards.</p> <p>These are small steps, but perhaps encouraging signs. We also look forward to the UK government's implementation plan for the UN guiding principles on business and human rights as another sign that government, industry, trade unions and civil society will continue to work closely on ending exploitation and protecting the rights of all those engaged in helping to revive the UK economy. We also look forward to increasing attention to the global supply chains of both UK-based companies and the British government itself.</p> <p>Michael Connarty MP's private members bill \u2013 <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/transparencyinukcompanysupplychainseradicationofslavery.html\" title=\"\">Transparency in Company Supply Chains</a> (Eradication of Slavery) will have its second reading in the house of commons on Friday 19 October, during Anti-Slavery Week. This is a UK version of the California Transparency Act, requiring all companies over a certain size to report on their efforts to ensure a slavery-free supply chain. Significantly, unlike the American act, the British bill will include not just companies producing tangible goods but also those offering services such as hospitality. A commitment from the British government to find time for this legislation would be a welcome sign of their commitment to help root out exploitation and forced labour wherever it occurs. Or, as President Obama called it last week, this \"debasement of our common humanity \u2013 the injustice, the outrage of human trafficking which must be called by its true name modern-day slavery\".</p> <p><em>John Morrison is executive director and Neill Wilkins is programme manager at the </em><a href=\"http://www.ihrb.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Institute for Business and Human Rights</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

But is the stamp duty suggestion a good one?</p> <p>The argument for London mayors having the London proceeds of the property tax, which raised 1.3bn from the capital last year, and spending them on housing and regeneration is of a piece with the wider case for giving City Hall greater autonomy, including in its fiscal affairs. The most recent devolution of powers handed Johnson more control in this core area of policy, but not more cash to go with it - and that cash continues to take the form of central government grants, allocated according to criteria set at national level.</p> <p>The way City Hall sees it, even a straight substitution of stamp duty takings for housing grant would be an improvement. It maintains that the stamp duty yield has been pretty much the same as funding settlements over the past ten years, and can be relied upon even when, as recently, the housing market has, in general, been less than booming. </p> <p>This greater certainty compared with Treasury largesse - which, let's face it, can't be depended on at all just now - would, the logic goes, make it easier to borrow to invest, especially in land, enabling greater ambition and flexibility in mayoral decisions. Such a move would also be consistent with the Scottish executive's receiving Scotland's stamp duty from 2015 and changes enabling local authorities to keep more of their income from housing. There's also a Londonist cry that we capital-dwellers pay more stamp duty than compatriots elsewhere, so it's only fair that our taxes benefit London instead of Warrington or Wolverhampton. </p> <p>What's wrong with this picture? Well, we might contend that if Mayor Johnson expended half the time and energy on tackling all aspects of London's housing crisis as he does banging on about airports, a far bigger difference might be made. According to <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9588554/Boris-Johnson-stakes-claim-to-capitals-stamp-duty-revenue.html\">the Telegraph</a> the stamp duty request is unlikely to be included in Osborne's autumn statement in any case. </p> <p>Even so, the devolutionist principle seems sound. I understand that overtures have been made to the <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/london-finance-commission\">London Finance Commission</a>, set up by Mayor Johnson after the election to <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/LFC%20Terms%20of%20Reference.pdf\">\"help him improve the tax and public spending arrangements for London in order to promote jobs and growth\" (pdf)</a> to take the idea forward.

  "<p>I must confess I didn't catch much of Labour's conference. However, I did welcome Ed Miliband's focus on where he went to school. I hope my party will use our conference to remind the country that it is the Conservatives who are closing the gap between the richest and poorest pupils by providing schools with an <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/pupilsupport/premium\">extra \u00a3600 for each pupil </a>from a poorer family. That's alongside establishing a \u00a3110 million <a href=\"http://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/\">Education Endowment Fund</a> for innovative proposals to help struggling schools, the march of academies, and the increase in the number of 'superheads' who can transform schools.<br> </p> <p>It was also very generous of Miliband to highlight the importance of apprenticeships. I am one of the first MPs to hire an apprentice and then train her up and then give her a job. Again, I hope my party takes the opportunity to remind the public that under Labour we had far fewer apprenticeships in the UK than our competitors \u2013 but that since May 2010 apprentice numbers are up by 63 per cent under this Government.<br> At their conference Labour failed to back our welfare cap, failed to back our immigration cap and called for more spending, more borrowing and more debt - exactly what got us into this mess in the first place. I want to see our conference remind voters in places like Stockton South, Carlisle, Keighley, Blackpool North, Chester, Dewsbury, Pudsey and all across Yorkshire, exactly why they abandoned Labour in 2010 and why, if they work hard, and play by the rules, it's the Conservatives who are cutting the deficit and who will stick by them in these tough times. In fact, here in the north east, it's down on the council estates and tougher areas where policies like welfare reform are most popular. Welfare reform may not seem that important where Ed lives in Primrose Hill. However, when you're getting up at 6am every morning to clean floors or work in a factory and you see your neighbour's house, curtains still drawn, benefits claimed, kids with the latest trainers \u2013 that you are struggling to afford for your own - it starts to grate knowing you're paying for it all. Where people can't find a job, they need every bit of help we can afford. However, on the doorstep, bringing to an end Labour's 'something for nothing culture' with the benefits cap is a popular move, in touch with the aspirations of hard-working northern families. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397258886\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/29/1348925161615/Yvette-Cooper-002.jpg\" alt=\"Yvette Cooper\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yvette Cooper; conceded immigration mistakes.

Yet where was her acceptance of our steps to control immigration, acknowledgement that immigration needs to come down, and her backing for our policies to reduce abuses of the student visa route? Between 1997 and 2009 net migration totalled more than 2.2 million people \u2013 that is more than twice the population of Birmingham. I hope we will remind voters next week that we have put a cap on non-EU migration. I speak as a descendent of immigrants, but there is no desire in the north for uncontrolled immigration, as it was under Labour. <br> Party conferences can be like Star Trek conventions for politicos. Birmingham for three days next week may be a long way from the North East, where I was knocking on doors last week, listening to what voters had to say. But there is a serious message to be delivered. On the big issues that voters raise with me, it is the Conservatives delivering for hardworking families up here in the north.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397258887\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/5/1349439474790/guy.jpg\" alt=\"guy opperman\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><strong><a href=\"http://guyopperman.blogspot.com/\">Guy Opperman</a></strong> is Conservative MP for Hexham and <a href=\"http://www.totalpolitics.com/blog/258477/top-50-conservative-blogs-2011.thtml\">an enthusiastic blogger.</a></em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Friday 5 October 2012.

  "<p>Another weekend, another round of big MLS fixtures, as the regular season winds up for a tense finale. We have the Cascadia Cup game between <strong>Seattle Sounders</strong> and <strong>Portland Timbers</strong> on Sunday night, which promises to be quite the spectacle, following Portland's gauntlet thrown down to Seattle's fans earlier this season. We also have <strong>New York Red Bulls</strong> and <strong>Chicago Fire</strong> meeting for the rubber match of their three game series at Red Bull Arena - though if the playoff standings remain as they are, that particular series could turn into five games in November. <strong>DC United</strong> will have something to say about that - they have to travel to <strong>Toronto FC</strong> on Saturday, but might feel they'll take the travel day over the home game that rivals <strong>Columbus Crew</strong> face - the visit of Eastern leaders and already play-off-bound <strong>Sporting KC.</strong> </p> <p>Keeping an eye on all their Eastern rivals will be <strong>Houston Dynamo</strong>, who host a <strong>Montreal Impact</strong> side who'll have to settle for a creditable first season rather than a play-off spot. Two sides already assured of playoff spots meet on Saturday night, when <strong>LA Galaxy</strong> host <strong>Real Salt Lake</strong> in a repeat of last year's Western Conference Final. That's our live game this weekend. The Home Depot Center will have a busy weekend - on Sunday <strong>Chivas USA</strong> are hosting <strong>FC Dallas</strong>, who came very close to giving their playoff hopes an unexpected boost against the Earthquakes last time out, only to be thwarted by the ninth stoppage time goal of the season from the Shield leaders (Vancouver's big midweek win hasn't helped their case either). <strong>San Jose</strong> travel to <strong>Colorado</strong> on Saturday night as they try to press for home field advantage throughout the play-offs. Earlier that evening <strong>New England Revolution</strong> will travel to <strong>Philadelphia Union</strong>, with the prospect of their own new home having been dangled in front of their fans once again this week, according to Revs previewer Julie Kumor. There's not been much for the Revs or the Union fans to cheer about this year, though the Union's surprise win over Chicago will have cheered up the Sons of Ben.</p> <p>Always cheery (except under certain result-related circumstances) - our collection of fan reps, bloggers, podcasters and beat writers for each competing team, who preview this week's schedule below. Read what they have to say and leave your own predictions and thoughts in our comments below, then join me for <strong>this weekend's live game of LA Galaxy vs Real Salt Lake on Saturday night</strong>. Then we'll see you back here on Monday morning for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/mls-five-things-we-learned\">Five Things we learned</a> this weekend.</p> <p><em>All times are listed in ET. </em></p> <p><em>Some previews were submitted before the midweek games.</em></p> <h2>Toronto FC vs D.C. United, Sat 1pm (TSN, RDS)</h2> <p><strong>Sonja Missio</strong>, <em>90 minutes of Hopp</em>, Toronto:</p> <p>I have been at a loss for words only three times in my life: the first, when I was six, and was asked to play \"Seraphim #1\" in St. Luke's production of Jesus' First Christmas. The second, when I was 22, and I was informed that I was going to become an aunt. And the third, when I was 25, and The Guardian asked me to write about Toronto FC, after a 4\u20131 loss with three games left in (arguably) their worst season, ever. Here goes nothing.</p> <p>On Saturday, TFC lost 4 \u2013 1 to the New York Red Bulls. Ryan Johnson gave the Reds a promising early lead\u2014minutes after Luis Silva hit the post\u2014however, it went downhill from there. NYRB treated TFC like a Timbits Soccer league (note to non-Canadians: soccer for children, ages four to eight); defender Markus Holgersson equalized, forward Kenny Cooper scored the brace, and Thierry Henry had three assists and a goal. And, yes, two of the four goals came after the 85th minute. There's not really a whole lot more to say. As last place team, the best Toronto can hope for is finishing the season without major injury (I forgot to mention, the second goal was made possible because defender Richard Eckersley collided with keeper Freddy Hall). The Reds face DC United at home on Saturday, and as DC are still in a playoff position, they will be looking for the away win. But, hey, at least we still have Champions League to look forward to! \u2026 sigh.</p> <p><strong>Martin Shatzer</strong>, <em>Black and Red United</em>, DC United:</p> <p>D.C. United escaped Portland with a draw this past Saturday, which leaves fans with some mixed emotions. On the positive side, the list of teams that have gone to Portland and left WITHOUT points this year includes the Earthquakes, Sounders, Fire, and Sporting Kansas City. So that at least seems encouraging on the surface. But on the negative side, earning only a single point meant that the Columbus Crew moved closer to United in the battle for the playoffs. But perhaps more importantly, the draw wasn't necessarily an attractive one. United's lone goal came on a perhaps dubious penalty kick call, while the team generated few other good scoring chances.</p> <p>Still, United is riding a four-game undefeated streak into the month of October, and the team has a great chance of extending that streak with a visit to lowly Toronto FC on Saturday. D.C. will certainly be watching the scoreboard of the game between the Crew and SKC, but United is still in total control of its playoff destiny, and could move even higher up the standings if the recent success continues.</p> <h2>New York Red Bulls vs Chicago Fire, Sat 3.30pm (NBC, TSN 2, RDS2)</h2> <p><strong>Dan Ryazansky</strong>, <em>Metrofanatic</em>, New York:</p> <p>Last week's game against Toronto repeated a number of things from games past: an early goal allowed by New York and complete domination by Titi Henry. After Ryan Johnson opened the scoring for the visitors, the magnificent French ubermensch contributed to four New York goals. His corner kick connected with Markus Holgersson's head for the first. His no-look pass found an open Kenny Cooper for the second. He juggled and set up Cooper again for the third. The fourth came off his own foot on a looping curve for a resounding victory. The last two goals were celebrated in front of the South Ward, Henry honoring Metro past with his red and black armband.</p> <p>Chicago comes into Red Bull Arena for a game that is likely to determine second place in the East. The two teams are tied on points entering the week; no matter what Chicago does in its game in hand against Philly, New York will take over second place with a victory. A victory coupled with a Houston loss or a Columbus non-win would clinch a playoff berth. \"Clever\" Hans Backe, who has tinkered with the lineup in recent weeks, would be wise to stick with what's working, with the only question being the choice between Bill Gaudette and Luis Robles in goal.</p> <p><strong>Dan Martin</strong>, <em>Section 8</em>, Chicago:</p> <p>The heady sense brought on by seven wins out of eight games that a lot of Fire supporters felt coming into the past week has largely dissipated following two successive Eastern Conference losses. The road performance in KC was bad but the home collapse to Philly was even worse, especially considering their place in the table and the Fire's extended home undefeated streak against Eastern teams, that came to an end with this loss. Both games saw the squad sunk by opportunistic early goals from the opposition and the Fire were unable to come back to win as they had done in several previous matches after initially falling behind. The club's overall play has not been abysmal but it is clear that the team's collective early defensive lapses cannot continue to be bailed out by stellar individual offensive performances as these late season games progress. Playoff spots (or spoiling them) are on the minds of every player in the league and there won't be room to let up even momentarily.</p> <p>Saturday at New Jersey is another huge matchup -- so huge, in fact, that the league began hyping it even before the Fire's game against the Union. As the Fire have now lost the game-in-hand they held over the other clubs around them in the standings, any result that can be had from this game will be a positive. The absence of Pavel Pardo from the starting midfield has been a real problem but given the Red Bulls' tendency for their own defensive lapses we could still see the Fire's offense grab some goals. I'd look for the Fire to play for a result but a win is not out of the question.</p> <h2>Philadelphia Union vs New England Revolution, Sat 7pm</h2> <p><strong>Scott Kessler</strong>, <em>The Brotherly Game,</em> Philadelphia:</p> <p>A weird week it has been for the Philadelphia Union. One point from the Columbus Crew looked in the bag for a short time period, but the Union were thwarted from this endeavor by an assistant referee, who chose to keep down his flag despite Milovan Mirosevic clearly moving a foot behind the last defender. Mirosevic's goal was a haunting microcosm of the Union's entire season, one filled with disappointment and covered in mistakes. </p> <p>Eliminated from the playoffs mathematically, the Union then headed to Chicago to take on the Fire with little to play for beyond future jobs, pride and spoiling an opposing team's playoff hopes. Philadelphia was able to accomplish that in Chicago. A 3-1 win was started by a sublime finish by Jack McInerney, whose starting position at striker has come under attack in recent games. He lost the role for a moment to Josue Martinez, who has had more problems than McInerney at convincing head coach John Hackworth of future playing time. McInerney's goal was followed up by a wonderstrike by Gabriel Gomez, his first goal since getting injured in May, then Antoine Hoppenot put the game away late when he backheeled a low Michael Farfan cross into the the back of he net, past Sean Johnson. For the first time in a while for the Union, the game was aptly handled and controlled.</p> <p>Saturday brings the second to last home game for Philadelphia, which hosts the New England Revolution. The team will look to head into the offseason with a winning streak - or at least an undefeated one - which would also mean beating the Houston Dynamo, Sporting Kansas City and the New York Red Bulls. Prediction - Philadelphia Union 2 - 2 New England Revolution</p> <p><strong>Julie Kumor</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.midnightriders.com/\">Midnight Riders</a>, New England:</p> <p>The Revs season is over. It has been over since the losing streak started in mid-August. To get a look into the mindset of the fans, on Saturday night at the viewing we were playing a drinking game - free drink to the person that guessed which Rev player would get yellow carded first \u2014 not score, we have no faith in their finishing \u2014 but which player would get the hand to the pocket from the ref. I won. I guessed Cardenas, and was rewarded (punished?) with a shot of El Jimador, as Alexi Lalas and MLS would want. </p> <p>Hangover gone, Monday rolls around, suddenly we have something to be excited about, there is buzz about the Revs finally getting a stadium in town. This article wasn't in some local paper with vague quotes and rumors, this was in the Boston Globe, with quotes from the mayor of Revere, Dan Rizzo. We had heard the whispers before, so we were all taking it with a grain of salt. The story got legs, NESN picked it up and we perked up. Rev fans have heard for years from the FO \"We expect to make a stadium announcement in the next 6 months, to infinity and beyond\" This morning, I saw Dan Rizzo on the local Fox channel - we had moved beyond print to television. I watched the clip and this man wants the Revs to come to Revere. The interviewer from Fox treated this as a legit story - this wasn't her asking silly questions and not once in the interview did I hear the term \"<a href=\"http://bostonherald.com/track/inside_track/view/20220627tracked_down\">Kicker Cutie</a>.\" Twitter is all about moving to Revere and what the typical game day could be like - even the most hardened Rev fans could come back to the team.</p> <p>Suddenly this season doesn't seem to be so over or lost. This week though, the eleven traveling Rev fans in Philly will be disappointed with a 2-0 loss.</p> <h2>Houston Dynamo vs Montreal Impact, Sat 8.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Zach Woosley</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.dynamotheory.com/\">Dynamo Theory</a>, Houston Dynamo:</p> <p>For 65 minutes last week's game was a nightmare. Terrible conditions, with the rain pouring down; the referees in Columbus completely handing the Crew three points; Dynamo fans were ready to just curl up in a ball and pretend it wasn't real. Then Brian Ching entered the match and saved us with his amazing awesomeness and everything was better. Ricardo Clark scored the match winner, Boniek Garcia added a second for good measure and we could all take a deep breath. The Dynamo are still in fifth, just barely, and we get to suffer all over again in a few days.</p> <p>This week: A WIN. There's no other option really. A home match against a non-playoff team is a must win match. Hopefully the weather will be better and it won't be quite as stressful as the Revs match, but we'll see. Kinnear will likely stick with the 4-4-2 formation but this match against the Montreal Impact is going to be tricky. The Impact won't be missing key players like the Revs were and they'd love nothing more to be the first team to win in BBVA Compass Stadium and potentially ruin the Dynamo's season. We're going to win, because there's no other option, but I doubt many of us will have nails left by the end of the 90 minutes.</p> <p><strong>Sofiane Benzaza</strong>, <em>Mount Royal Soccer</em>, Montreal:</p> <p>A tie against Sporting Kansas City did not help the Montreal Impact cause at all. That cause is called the 2012 MLS playoffs and during the ''bye-weekend'' Montreal had no help at all. Houston, D.C and Columbus did not lose in Week 30 and almost squashed all Impact playoff hopes. It does not help morale at all when you see that the Dynamo scored both goals in the last 10 minutes and the Crew gets a controversial goal on an obvious offside.</p> <p>The ambiance in the Montreal locker room is still positive as long the mathematics do not rule out the club's playoff chances. But taking on a Houston Dynamo team that is unbeaten at BBVA Compass Stadium is no easy task. The last meeting in Houston saw the Impact crash and burn in the second half and lose 3-0. The biggest upcoming change will be a formation change, with Collen Warner suspended and Nelson Rivas out for the season. Whether it's a 4-4-2 or a 3-5-2, Jesse Marsch has hinted towards a Marco Di Vaio - Andrew Wenger pairing up front and this is getting fans excited. A move that helps for now and the future and I expect Andrew Wenger to be a positive influence on the field for the Montreal Impact. In the season series this third game will be the tiebreaker. We just hope it will not go Houston's way.</p> <h2>Colorado Rapids vs San Jose Earthquakes, Sat 9pm</h2> <p><strong>Richard Bamber</strong>, <em>Bulldog Supporters</em>, Colorado Rapids:</p> <p>A credible 1-1 draw against a virtually full strength LA Galaxy team is something that supporters of most teams would be pleased with, none more so than the Rapids faithful. In contrast to numerous other games this year, the Rapids actually fought back to gain a point after they went 1-0 down in the 10th minute.</p> <p>However only the most optimistic (or clinically insane!) of Rapids fans now believe we have any hope of making the play-offs as we basically have to win our last three games &amp; hope that Vancouver gains no more than a point from their last three. It could all be over by Wednesday night, should bottom side Chivas USA fail to get anything from the game at BC Place. This is all before we consider Saturday's opposition, the 2nd visit of San Jose Earthquakes to DSG Park. Common sense says we will be lucky to get another tie however with the possibility of the pressure being off by then, our boys could just yet come up with something spectacular...</p> <p><strong>Lisa Erickson</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.centerlinesoccer.com/\">Center Line Soccer</a>, San Jose:</p> <p>Another week, another 2 points dropped. The ever hungry FC Dallas came to Santa Clara as a team in need of a win and almost accomplished that task. The game was very chippy (including another scuffle between teams which should have seen Dallas lose a man or two to red cards). Trailing going into stoppage time, the Earthquakes did what they do best as Gordon to Lenhart magic struck in the 95th minute for the league record ninth stoppage time goal (and the Earthquakes 12th game winning/tying goal after the 82nd minute) to make it 3 - 3. The precious point didn't come without a cost, in the 51st minute Mehdi Ballouchy came down hard on the pitch tearing his left ACL and is expected to be out the rest of the year. Also, Victor Bernardez ended up getting another yellow card which will force him to sit against Colorado on Saturday.</p> <p>If the San Jose Earthquakes have a hope of winning the Supporter's Shield, they need a victory over Colorado. It will be a tough fight and all depending on who is healthy for the match up. With Bernardez out, it will be interesting if Ike Opara (suffering from concussion like symptoms) will be back in the mix or if Justin Morrow will slot back to the center and allow Ramiro Corrales the left back position. Midfield will hopefully see both Marvin Chavez and Shea Salinas on the wings, if Simon Dawkins ankle is still troubling him. Sam Garza should be healthy enough to also make an appearance on (or off) the bench with Ballouchy no longer available. I'd expect Alan Gordon to keep his starting position over Lenhart and play up top with Wondo. I think this will be a hard fought match at altitude, but I think the Quakes can do it. </p> <h2>LA Galaxy vs Real Salt Lake, Sat 9pm (NBCSN, TSN 2)</h2> <p><strong>GUARDIAN LIVE GAME</strong></p> <p><strong>Brian Lynch</strong>, <em>Angel City Brigade</em>, Los Angeles:</p> <p>The Galaxy got a point in Colorado in what was a lackluster performance. The team looked slow and didn't play with any sense of urgency, which was surprising considering they needed a win to keep pace with RSL for the second playoff spot. To make matters worse, A.J. DeLaGarza went down with a sprained knee, the status of which is not fully known at this point. 22 year old Tommy Meyer stepped in and played well but it was the Galaxy offense that sputtered and couldn't net a second goal at altitude.</p> <p>Now the Galaxy start a stretch of three games against rivals to end the season. The intensity of these rivalries varies from respectful disdain (RSL) to seething hatred (San Jose), so it will be fun to watch. What it really means though is that the Galaxy control their own destiny; if they win all three they assure themselves the number two spot in the West. First up is RSL in a battle between maybe the two most balanced sides in MLS. DeLaGarza will sit this one out, most likely replaced by Meyer. Outside of that expect the Galaxy to bring everyone and the kitchen sink to the game. The star-studded midfield of Wilhelmsson, Beckham, Juninho, and Sarvas will be playing to Keane and Donovan, while the defense hangs back and tries to contain RSL's potent attack. Cascadia may be the spectacle this week, but if you want quality soccer tune in on Saturday.</p> <p><strong>Denzel Eslinger</strong>,<em> RSL Perspective</em>, Real Salt Lake:</p> <p>Real Salt Lake enter their match with the LA Galaxy with revenge on their mind and momentum in their pocket. It is strange to think that at this critical time of the season, only RSL have an actual winning streak in MLS action, their two wins (Portland and Chivas USA) is the only winning streak in the league. RSL and the LA Galaxy have become one of the premier matches to watch in MLS, from the excitement of the 2009 MLS Cup to the recent LA 3-2 win at Rio Tinto Stadium, these two sides have played action packed matches for the last couple of years and while RSL holds a 5-4-1 edge since the MLS Cup, the two sides are very evenly matched on the pitch. It is two different styles, two different philosophies that clash on the pitch and with RSL healthy and with no suspensions this should be a chance to gain some huge points towards securing a good playoff position. I just have a feeling this one is destined for a 2-2 draw, but no matter the result it should be an entertaining match to watch.</p> <h2>Columbus Crew vs Sporting KC, Sun 4pm</h2> <p><strong>Ian Fraser,</strong> <em>Crew Union</em>, Columbus Crew:</p> <p>Last weekend Columbus jumped out to a comfortable 2-0 halftime lead courtesy of Jairo Arrieta against the Philadelphia Union. At home, against an all but eliminated Union team, you would have thought the 3 points were safe but no win comes easy for this team. After giving up a penalty to make things interesting, Jack McInerney managed to find some space in the Crew backline and finish a deflected cross to level the score. With the Crew playoff push seemingly crushed with the late game collapse, the cardiac Crew managed to do it again (thanks to blown offside call by the AR) and Milovan Mirosevic gave the Crew another late goal victory.<br> Sporting KC make the trip to Columbus this weekend with both teams still fighting on different fronts. Unlike Columbus, SKC have a playoff spot secure but they are in the thick of the Supporter Shield race and also the race to claim the top spot in the East. Columbus need to get as many points as possible to overtake Houston and/or DC to get into the postseason and this is a good time for them to show they belong. It is clear they are better than the lower half of the table but this team needs to show they can beat a quality team. Columbus have proven they can score with Higuain and Arrieta in the side but the defense will dictate how this team finishes. They continue to leak goals and everyone is clamoring for a return of Vukovic to LB and WIlliams at CB. Uncertainty around Julius James seemingly could open the door for that but Vukovic needs to get out of Warzycha's doghouse. SKC has a potent offense so this is as good as time as ever to clean it up in the back and get this team a huge victory. Chris Birchall's return to the CM will also give some help to the defense and they grind out a 2-1 victory.</p> <p><strong>Mike Kuhn</strong>, <em>Down the Byline</em>, Sporting Kansas CIty:</p> <p>Last week Sporting KC cleared the first hurdle in their attempt to win MLS Cup. In front of a record crowd, they took care of the Chicago Fire 2-0 in fairly impressive fashion, thanks to a pair of goals by Graham Zusi. KC finally took advantage of some of the possession that they get at home and the number of shots they get. The Fire sat back a little more than they probably should and the referee let the game get physical, which played right into the style of play that fits KC's high pressure.</p> <p>With the playoffs clinched, KC now goes on the road in an attempt to get the top seed in the East and keep the pressure on San Jose for the Supporters' Shield. While KC can technically have a top 3 spot wrapped up by the time they take the field, if other results go their way, they don't have the luxury to sit back and just watch results come in if they want to keep pace with the Earthquakes. They also can't take it easy against a Crew side who are fighting for their playoff lives. These two teams have split the season series so far this year, each winning on the road, KC 2-0 on the back of a Teal Bunbury brace, and Columbus 2-1 thanks to a Jairo Arrieta brace. That Columbus win in KC is the last team to beat KC, a stretch of 10 games in all competitions counting the US Open Cup final. They haven't given up a goal in over 300 minutes, since Brad Davis scored at Livestrong. Another win to continue their good run of form away from Livestrong Sporting Park isn't out of the question, but against a desperate Crew side it won't be easy.</p> <h2>Chivas USA vs FC Dallas, Sun 7pm (Galavision)</h2> <p><strong>Alicia Ratterree</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.thegoatparade.com/\">The Goat Parade</a>, Chivas USA:</p> <p>Chivas USA had a midweek game up in Vancouver against the Whitecaps, but lost again 4-0. The loss sets some dubious marks, including a club record for most consecutive losses, with seven. The team has not scored in nearly six full matches, so that coupled with the losing streak means the team is very hard to watch at the moment. With no offense and terrible defense, it is no surprise that head coach Robin Fraser's seat is practically on fire at this point.</p> <p>Chivas get another bite at the apple Sunday against FC Dallas. Considering Dallas are desperately pushing for the final spot in the playoffs and Chivas appear to be rooted in last place, Dallas' hopes for an easy three points look solid. Considering this is the second straight year that Chivas have limped their way through the final third of the season, the chances of getting any draws, let alone wins, look remote at this point. But that's why they play the games. </p> <p><strong>Gina Zippilli</strong>, <em>The Inferno</em>, Dallas:</p> <p>Last week went great - none of us were expecting anything going into San Jose. It was a case of hope for the best prepare for the worst, and we had the Vancouver game on at the same time to see what they were doing at the same time (they ended up tieing). And then it ended up being a great game that went back and forth till the 88th minute when Matt hedges of all people popped up to put us 3-2 up. Yes San Jose came back to tie it, but it was a result we'd have taken beforehand.</p> <p>This week we're going into a do-or-die situation. We're playing Chivas, and they're looking pretty terrible right now, but Vancouver won 4-0 against them midweek, and have a five point lead on us going into the weekend, so we have to win. You just never know with this team. they're pretty near full strength. Brek Shea picked up a knock in the last game and is being monitored day to day and George John is said to be at \"90%\". I'd take a 90% John over Pertuz. No offense to Pertuz, but George John is George John. I'm not going to make a prediction other than I'll barely be able to watch. They've made me believe and now I'm afraid they'll break my heart.</p> <h2>Seattle Sounders vs Portland Timbers, Sun 9pm (ESPN, ESPN Deportes, TSN 2)</h2> <p><strong>Dave Clark</strong>, <em>Sounder at Heart</em>, Seattle Sounders:</p> <p>Last week saw the Seattle Sounders struggle to score goals, again. Their best moments were when their stout defense enabled the Rave Green to spring free on the counter. It is that defense that is the core to Seattle's success. It is the second best by goals against and fourth best by shots against. Stout defense is not enough though. In September, particularly against the Vancouver Whitecaps, the offense struggled. Road points are valuable, though the draw is disappointing. The Sounders must do better.</p> <p>Thankfully this week they face the worst road team in MLS. A team that is yet to win on the road. A team that gives up more than two goals a game on the road. A team that only has one road shutout, back on May 15. If a team in MLS needs to earn a statement win there could not be a better opponent, particularly with a record setting crowd. There is also the motivation for Seattle of the Cascadia Cup and the Playoffs being on the line. It's good to be a Sounders right now, because the chances of a win could not be higher.</p> <p><strong>Roger Anthony</strong>, <em>Timbers Army</em>, Portland Timbers:</p> <p>Last week's 1-1 draw at home against D.C. United revealed a previously unseen side of the Timbers: instead of getting mad about a ridiculous penalty call against the armpit of CB David Horst, the Timbers got even, with burly forward Bright Dike netting what was probably the most difficult of his three good chances. United's had a remarkable bounce-back year, but Dwayne De Rosario's injury and the West Coast travel grind left them running on empty and fortunate to earn the single point.</p> <p>Speaking of armpits \u2026 the lads now head north to the Clink, aka Seattle's CenturyLink Field. A crowd of 67,000 is expected for the penultimate Cascadia Cup match, with Portland needing only a draw to wrap up the Cup. There will be interesting matchups all over the field, particularly in the middle of the pitch, where Portland lines up Beauty (the bedazzling runs of winger Franck Songo'o) and the Beast (CM and yellow-card magnet Diego Chara). Seattle counters with three big stars (Alonso, Rosales and Tiffert) and one big mouth (Brad Evans). Despite an alignment of firepower, Seattle has managed just five goals in its last five MLS contests, going 1-1-3 in the process.</p> <p>The question becomes: Upon which side will the law of averages fall? Will Rosales, Tiffert, Montero and Johnson take out their fourth-place frustrations on lowly Portland? Or will the Timbers, winless on the road all year, muster up the grit to collect a point \u2013 and the nice little trophy that wants to come home?</p>",
  "<p>The fall-out from the John Terry racism case has taken another twist after Ashley Cole lashed out at the Football Association on Twitter. Cole's outburst came after his evidence was criticised in the report detailing why Terry was banned for racially abusing the Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/05/john-terry-fa-written-reasons\" title=\"\">In the 63-page ruling released by the FA on Friday morning</a>, the independent regulatory commission said there were discrepancies in Cole's version of events. The Chelsea left-back responded on Friday afternoon by tweeting: \"Hahahahaa, well done #fa I lied did I, #BUNCHOFTWATS.\"</p> <p>Cole later deleted the tweet and apologised for expressing his \"feelings in the heat of the moment\". In a statement via his solicitor he said: \"I had just finished training and saw the captions on the TV screens in the treatment rooms about what was said in the FA commission ruling about me. I was really upset. I apologise unreservedly for my comment about the FA.\"</p> <p>The FA has declined to comment on Cole's post, which has invited disciplinary action and could have implications for the defender's England career. The case has already seen Terry retire from international duty. Cole was on Thursday named in the squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against San Marino and Poland and he will reach a century of caps should he feature in both matches.</p> <p>While the Chelsea manager, Roberto Di Matteo, said they would look into the matter: \"We'll look at the tweet and then we'll see. I don't think the players are out of control,\" a club statement emphasised that Cole did not accept the criticism made of him by the commission: \"Ashley co-operated at all times with the FA and stands by the evidence that he gave and does not accept the criticism that has been made.\"</p> <p>Cole's evidence helped Terry <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jul/13/john-terry-cleared-anton-ferdinand\" title=\"\">in his acquittal at Westminster magistrates court</a> in July but the FA last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/27/john-terry-verdict-chelsea-guilty\" title=\"\">banned Terry for four matches and fined him \u00a3220,000</a>.</p> <p>Cole's involvement surrounded Terry's claim that he had only been repeating the words \"fucking black cunt\" that he thought Ferdinand had accused him of saying. Cole backed up his team-mate and said he thought Ferdinand may have used the word \"black\".</p> <p>But according to the independent commission, Cole did not mention the word \"black\" in the initial interview with the FA on October 28. On 3 November the Chelsea club secretary, David Barnard, asked the FA for the specific word \"black\" to be inserted into Cole's witness statement.</p> <p>The commission deemed an email exchange between the FA and Barnard should be regarded as \"cogent new evidence\", saying: \"These highly material issues relating to Mr Cole's evidence were not addressed by the chief magistrate \u2013 he clearly did not have the interview notes of the FA's interviewers, or Mr Barnard's statement before him \u2013 and they do not appear in his judgment.</p> <p>\"Had it been before him, the commission has no doubt that the chief magistrate would have examined Mr Cole's evidence as to what he claims he heard Mr Ferdinand say to Mr Terry on the pitch very carefully indeed, or scrutinised it even more closely than he may have done.\"</p> <p>It added: \"All of this causes the commission to have very real concerns about the accuracy of Mr Barnard's recollections and the motivation for the assertions that he makes in his witness statement about what Mr Cole said during the FA interview of him, particularly his alleged use of the word 'black'.\"</p> <p>Chelsea said they stand by Barnard completely and that he acted with complete integrity throughout the process. \"David co-operated fully with the FA. He stands by his evidence and does not accept the criticism that has been made,\" the statement continued. \"It should also be noted that David was not given the opportunity to give oral evidence to the commission, so we feel any criticism is unjustified.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lawyers acting for more than 170 phone-hacking victims, including Cherie Blair and Hugh Grant, were dealt a blow on Friday after losing a high court application to force News International to do a general search of its databases for potential evidence of illegal voicemail interception.</p> <p>However, the high court did order News International to hand over nine previously undisclosed emails between News International and the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, who is at the centre of the phone-hacking scandal.</p> <p>The phone-hacking claimants were seeking further disclosure in relation to Mulcaire's activities before 2001 in an effort to establish whether voicemail interception had taken place earlier than admitted by News International during the course of the civil litigation proceedings.</p> <p>They were also seeking access to 433 emails in a file on the computer in the room of a senior News International executive labelled \"3 - Neville Thurlbeck.pst\", along with other documentation submitted to the Metropolitan police and the Leveson inquiry. The .pst suffix would ordinarily refer to personal Microsoft Outlook email folders.</p> <p>Mr Justice Vos said the decision not to allow more generic disclosure \"does not come easily to me\" in the light of previous evidence that News International, even during the course of litigation, had failed to disclose material it should have, and had also admitted to the destruction of emails.</p> <p>However, he said: \"Even with all that background, it seems to me that, to put it bluntly, you can have too much of a good thing\", adding that the \"value of further general disclosure\" was \"unlikely to be justified\".</p> <p>He said he did not see how further generic disclosure could be \"proportionate\" in relation to civil proceedings or \"cost effective\".</p> <p>During the four-day hearing last week, News International argued that it had already made generic admission that phone hacking had taken place and further disclosure would not serve to advance their case as it had already been conceded by the publisher.</p> <p>It also told the court that searching all the documents disclosed to the Met by the law firm Linklaters' criminal team would cost over \u00a3500,000 and to search all the Microsoft Outlook files manually would cost around \u00a31m.</p> <p>Mr Justice Vos said: \"It seems to me that the bulk of any further disclosure should be on a case-specific basis.\"</p> <p>The court also heard that no application had been made by Mulcaire to have the civil trials, currently listed for June, adjourned on the grounds they could prejudice a criminal trial he is facing in September 2013.</p> <p>Vos said he could see how many of the lead cases in the civil litigation could be tried \"without trespassing on any allegations made in the criminal proceedings\".</p> <p>Last week, counsel for Mulcaire told the court she had concerns that Mulcaire's criminal case could be prejudiced by witnesses discussing how injured their feelings were by phone hacking in the earlier civil actions.</p> <p>Vos noted that News Group Newspapers, the subsidiary of News International that includes the Sun and the now-closed News of the World, had agreed voluntarily to do a manual search for disclosable documents in the Leveson files and the .pst files contained on \"Senior Executive B's\" computer. This, said Vos, was \"a very constructive proposal\" and urged News International to continue to be responsive to \"measured requests\" for searches.</p> <p>He added he was not saying that no further application for generic disclosure would be possible. \"Circumstances can change,\" he warned.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for News International said Vos had \"in short, agreed with News Group Newspapers that 'enough is enough'\". She added: \"We have always been committed to bringing these proceedings to a fair, appropriate and expeditious conclusion and we welcome today's judgment which will assist that process.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>Despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/02/celebrity-memoirs-lose-alan-partridge\" title=\"\">falling sales for celebrity autobiographies</a>, publishers are continuing to bet on the genre, with major deals struck this week for memoirs from John Cleese, David Jason and David Suchet.</p> <p>Cleese and Jason were both signed \u2013 for undisclosed sums \u2013 by Random House, flush with cash after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/07/erotic-book-fifty-shades-british-bestseller\" title=\"\">the unstoppable success of EL James's erotic trilogy Fifty Shades of Grey</a>.</p> <p>According to the Random House imprint Century, Jason's \"inside story\" of \"how the youngest son of a Billingsgate market porter went on to become one of the most beloved actors of modern times\", starring in the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IBgk05iL3Y\" title=\"\">popular television series Only Fools and Horses</a>, will be published in autumn 2014.</p> <p>Cleese's as-yet-unscheduled memoir, meanwhile, will be \"hilariously frank and frankly hilarious\", said Random House, and will also reveal an \"inside story\", this time of \"how a shy child from Weston-super-Mare, who dabbled briefly with teaching and law, went on to become one of the most feted writers and performers of the past 50 years\".</p> <p>Suchet, who was signed up by Headline, will publish Poirot and Me in autumn 2013. The book, written with Geoffrey Wansell, will see the actor reflecting for the first time \"on the 24 years that he has played the role [of Poirot] and the fondness he has formed for the eccentric Belgian detective, and his fans worldwide\". Filming on the final five episodes of Agatha Christie's Poirot is about to begin.</p> <p>The deals come despite a considerable fall in sales for the celebrity autobiography genre over the last four years, as the market has been swamped with books from anyone with the smallest claim to fame. Nielsen BookScan figures show that sales for arts autobiographies \u2013 the sector most closely corresponding to celebrity memoirs \u2013 have dropped dramatically since a peak of \u00a351.5m in 2008, when 5.34m of the books were sold. Last year this figure had plummeted to 3m books sold in the genre, for a value of \u00a324.1m \u2013 less than half the total of four years previously.</p> <p>For the Foyles bookseller Jonathan Ruppin, celebrity autobiographies divide into two types: those from \"cultural icons\" like John Cleese whose appeal \"is broader than just fans of their programmes and films\", and those which are \"part of the campaign to retain a constant media presence\", such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/music/9781471110740/nice-to-meet-you\" title=\"\">Jessie J's Nice to Meet You</a>, which was published last week.</p> <p>\"I can certainly see David Jason, David Suchet and John Cleese being very strong sellers,\" Ruppin said.</p> <p>The publisher Ben Dunn, who acquired Jason's memoir for Century, is equally convinced that the right autobiography can still make a mark. \"The public appetite is there for the best \u2013 the genre has suffered from a shortage of quality and from publishing just too many books in any given year, but the truly compelling propositions can still be extremely successful, and would sell just as many now as they did a few years ago,\" he said, predicting that Jason's memoir would \"absolutely\" be \"one of the big ones\".</p> <p>\"He is hugely adored at a true national treasure level, his career is a catalogue of one defining TV moment after another, and he has never ever written anything before,\" said Dunn. \"People of this profile are so few and far between \u2013 it is truly momentous and we are honoured to be his publisher.\"</p>",
  "<p>I'm glad that David Cameron <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2213164/Victory-After-Mail-appeal-PM-WILL-pay-Bomber-Command-tribute.html\" title=\"\">stumped up on the taxpayers' behalf</a> overnight to relieve some very elderly trustees at the Bomber Command memorial trust of the risk that they might be <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19815835\" title=\"\">stuck with a nasty \u00a3550,000 bill</a>. The payout will cover the unexpected costs of the memorial's opening ceremony on the edge of London's Hyde Park this summer. A bit like a teenage party on Facebook, the launch <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/raf-bomber-command/9361572/Bomber-Command-memorial-service-as-it-happened.html\" title=\"\">got a bit out of hand</a>.</p> <p>All right, I know what you may be thinking. There are better things to spend money on when times are hard than a memorial to people who shouldn't have been carpet-bombing German cities night after night in the way they did during the second world war. It is a controversy that pre-figures in a relatively low-tech way the one raging today about the Obama administration's use of drones to kill its enemies in Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p> <p>If you are, you may have a point about the efficacy of Bomber Command's record. But yesterday I happened to drive past an old wartime aerodrome in the East Midlands and saw a simple plaque in a hedgerow. Measuring about 3ft x 4ft, marked by the British and American flags, it memorialised the many thousands of bomb crews who never made it back. The casualty rate was nearly one in two. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2210283/Solved-70-years-The-mystery-missing-Lancaster-bomber-crew.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">You cannot deny their courage</a>.</p> <p>As for the money, well, in the big picture it's detail when set against, say, the cost of the west coast rail franchise fiasco or a spot of bankers' tax avoidance. Ahead of his party conference, Cameron is in enough trouble with his party and the tabloids not to want to quibble. Incidentally, a rail man at Labour's conference told me that Britain's rail network has still to recover from gross over-use and lack of repair in the two wars, then being starved of investment during the impoverished post-war decades.</p> <p>So old men, the memorial's trustees who simply did their duty 70 years ago at great personal risk, don't deserve to be forced to sell their homes by people demanding money for insurance or other unplanned expenditure. I can't help wondering if some demanding payment are what people in 1939-45 might have called spivs or war profiteers, making money from other people's troubles via the black market and other dodgy activity. The entrepreneurial spirit doesn't always whistle patriotic tunes.</p> <p>I'm still uneasy on several counts, not least of all the strange surge of memorialising so long after the event and the dubious uses put to it: jingoism is always a tabloid temptation. There's also the aesthetics of the current craze. I was quite shocked when I first saw the new <a href=\"http://www.bombercommandmemorial.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Bomber Command memorial</a> \u2013 it's at the Piccadilly end of the park \u2013 by how large and insensitive it is \u2013 not the bronze fliers at its centre, but the pompous neo-classical columns around it.</p> <p>Hopelessly misjudged, I'd say. You'll know what I mean if you've ever seen the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans_Memorial\" title=\"\">Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall on the Mall in Washington DC</a>, its eloquent, sorrowful subtlety \u2013 57,000 (about the same number as Bomber Command lost) names all there on a polished black wall, set low in a dip in the ground. Not a good war, but a good memorial.</p> <p>But returning to Bomber Command's role, was it justified? Guardian art critic Jonathan Jones makes a pretty efficient assault on the dodgy aesthetics of morally dodgy policies <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/29/bomber-command-memorial-artistic-jingoism\" title=\"\">here</a>, more confidently than I would.</p> <p>By 1945, Churchill himself, no faintheart, was troubled by what the RAF \u2013 later joined by the USAF - had done in carpet-bombing German cities, at a time (in the early years at least) when Britain was taking a pounding from bombers and U-boats and had no other way of hitting back than by bomber raids that disproved Hitler's boasts.</p> <p>Historians have argued ever since about Dresden, Hamburg and other cities, Hiroshima too, of course. My qualms are usually settled by the sound of revisionist German historians \u2013 in Japan they don't need to revise a view which never included much contrition \u2013 arguing that the city bombings were war crimes.</p> <p>What I say is, let's not blame wars of European conquest entirely on Hitler or Kaiser Bill. Let's share it with Bismarck, a domestic tyrant and foreign aggressor, who doesn't get his share of the stick because of Germany's economic and cultural brilliance during his ascendancy. It all ended in tears, not all of which have yet been shed (have they, Mrs Merkel?).</p> <p>The more interesting question is, not \"was it legal?\" but was it wise? I heard an American professor on the radio today making that distinction about the drone raids which the Obama administration \u2013 not looking so durable after this week's debate with Mitt Romney \u2013 has used so widely.</p> <p>If the intelligence is good and the right target hit why risk American lives, goes the argument. Yes, but it isn't always good and civilians get killed, as they did in Hamburg, Berlin and the rest, as they did in London too, during the Blitz of 1940-41, which was arguably less discriminating than drones. Even when the war was as good as lost, London suffered the V1 and V2 raids of 1944-45, the frightening last flourish of German aerial aggression that had begun at Guernica and other towns in Republican Spain's civil war (1936-39).</p> <p>The American professor was confident that, in international law as well as US law, the drone attacks are justified, though others disagree. There is also a primitive sense of unfairness in drone attacks launched from Arizona, which \u2013 this is absurd, but heartfelt \u2013 did not apply in quite the same way to Bomber Command, which took its chances and suffered heavy losses of its own.</p> <p>But is it/was it wise? Does it create more militants than it kills, as the professor put it? Did it weaken German industrial capacity or did they patch it up? Did it destroy civilian morale or did it stiffen citizen resolve? After Vietnam, Lebanon and other air-based failures, it's commonplace today to dismiss the case that bombing works.</p> <p>But I suspect that's a retro-fitted verdict. Such issues are rarely black or white. After years of war and deep suffering the desire for revenge was very powerful and very human. Few spoke against it. They may have been the wiser few, but it took time to heal the wounds.</p> <p>As the current tussle between Berlin and Athens \u2013 occasionally between London and Dublin too \u2013 reminds us, it sometimes takes even longer to forget than forgive. That's a more subtle debate and Cameron, squeezed by the tabloids ahead of his party conference, may be forgiven for not giving it much thought on Thursday.</p>",

I think the P plate should be displayed no shorter than 12 months as a means to warn other drivers.<br>Personally, I just think the practical test in this country is shockingly easy. 30-40 minutes in a car isn't long enough to display suitable capability. I was surprised in 2006 when I finished my test as to how little I felt I'd been tested.<br>Make the test longer and much more difficult, as a result people will be forced to learn for longer. It's utterly ludicrous that you can pass a test having not displayed night time driving, rain/wind/ice control or motorway skills.<br>Tests should be limited as well with regard to re-takes. After 3 re-takes you should be forced to wait a year and procure more hours of experience with a qualified teacher. If you can re-take after re-take, inevitably the learner will pass after a fluked 30 minute test yet be scarily incapable on the roads.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>joyofyouth</strong>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These are reasonable suggestions from the perspective of actuaries, but ignores some fundamental issues associated with driving. The costs here are phrased in terms of lives saved, but we must also recognize the social cost of delaying and preventing licensing. Currently about 35% (2010 number) of 17-20 year olds have licenses. Of those without licenses only 6% say they don't want one (as opposed to 60% in other age categories). This means the existing framework is placing a significant damper on licenses already due to costs (both the cost of learning to drive and the cost of insurance once license is obtained). Further reducing the incentive to get a license without also addressing some of the cost issues will be detrimental to young people's abilities to contribute to society and to gain valuable experiences.<br>I think we would all agree that two substantial factors contributing to young drivers and accidents are a lack of experience and a relative lack of judgement. Graduated driving schemes are a good idea, especially if they provide drivers with cost incentives (which could be done by the insurers alone if they wanted to). Such schemes should encourage drivers to learn how to drive through on-the-road driving and perhaps take some of the judgement issues out of the driver's hands (though prohibiting night-time driving ignores the fact that the jump in accident rates is really during certain parts of the night such as 2-5 am when young drivers are 17X as likely as mature drivers to have accidents).</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18646474\"><strong>SadieD</strong></a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I feel there should definitely be restrictions on new drivers, in relation to speed and carrying passengers.

For example, wet roads, snow, dusk, bright sunshine, built up areas etc . This is best done with the guidance of experienced drivers who can help them through the experience, so that when they are driving on their own they will hopefully know how to react.<br>In Australia, new drivers are only allowed to carry one passenger as statistics show that the more passengers the higher the risk of crashes and fatalities. It should be adopted here. Anything that reduces deaths can only be a good thing. </p> </blockquote> <h2>On the West coast mainline fiasco</h2> <p>Our commenters had much to say about the news of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/oct/04/west-coast-mainline-fiasco-victims\">west coast mainline decision. </a><br> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18623616 \"><strong>Dromo</strong> says:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In this post I'm not taking sides on the question of whether or not the railways should be re-nationalised but as someone who once was in charge of the bidding process for a number of public service contracts (not in the UK) I'd like to ask how many times has the DfT evaluated bids for franchises since the railways were privatised.<br>One could imagine elementary mistakes like the present one being made in the early days but by now they should have a formal procedure in place that covers all the relevant aspects of how to evaluate the bids properly.<br>If the officials in the DfT do not have a set of instructions on how to do this then they are incompetent.<br>If they do have a procedure and it doesn't work after all this time then they are incompetent.<br>If it is a good procedure and they haven't been following it properly then they are incompetent.<br>Judging by the Government's long-standing record of mega disasters in the procurement and execution of major projects (just look at IT, for example) one suspects that this particular mess is not the only one where the evaluation of rail franchises bids has been flawed.</p> </blockquote> <p><br> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18624061\"><strong>BloodyTories</strong></a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I've been involved in bidding (on both sides).

  "<p>Last week, the <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/170191/human-rights-court-gives-torture-green-light\">European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) refused</a> to accept the appeal of their ruling allowing for the extradition of Babar Ahmad and four others to the United States. This decision, from a court whose very purpose is to ensure human rights are upheld, has been widely condemned by human rights groups and advocates, who are convinced the decision will do just the opposite. The appeal was largely based on the fact that if the men are extradited to the US, they will face years of torturous solitary confinement in America's notorious maximum security prisons.</p> <p>There is another disturbing aspect of the ruling, however, that is less discussed, but equally worrisome: that these men's chances of getting a fair trial will also be compromised by the pre-trial conditions in which they are likely to be held.</p> <p>Because Ahmad and the others fall under the category of terror suspects, there is a strong likelihood that if their extradition proceeds, they will be held in pre-trial detention facilities with <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/24mcrm.htm\">special administrative measures</a> (Sams) in place. Sams were established by the federal government in 1996 to deal with certain gang leaders who had demonstrated substantial risk that their \"communication or contact with persons could result in the death or serious bodily injury to persons.\" Since 9/11, the need for an inmate to have \"demonstrated\" their reach was relaxed, and the department of justice began to use Sams, pre-trial, for terrorism suspects.</p> <p>So what this means for pre-trial defendants is that they are not only held in the kind of extreme isolation that is routine in facilities like ADX Florence \u2013 the federal super-max prison where inmates spend 22 to 23 hours per day in a completely sealed and soundproof cell, and maybe an hour or so in an outdoor cage for solitary exercise \u2013 but they are also subjected to extra measures of isolation. This ensures both that they completely cut off from the outside world and that the outside world is cut off from them.</p> <p>A defendant placed under Sams is usually only allowed to communicate with his immediate family (parents, siblings, spouse and children) and his attorney. Letters to and from his approved family members can take up to six months to be cleared. Such prisoners cannot write to or receive visits from anyone else: friends, extended family or supporters; and they can have absolutely no contact with the media. In addition to the gag that is placed on these defendants, the small number of people with whom they are allowed to have contact are also gagged, as they, too, are bound to abide by the Sams. </p> <p>So, for instance, an attorney who goes to see her client in solitary somewhere like ADX Florence may notice that her client is deteriorating under the conditions of his confinement. But she cannot discuss those conditions with anyone \u2013 not the media, not even the prisoner's family.</p> <p>Sams are thus a pretty effective way of keeping a prisoner out of sight and out of mind, and preventing the public from knowing exactly what is going on inside America's federal prisons. The further consequence of this is a scenario that Franz Kafka himself would have had a hard time dreaming up: these conditions are imposed on defendants who have not yet been tried or convicted of anything \u2013 which rather throws the concept of being innocent until proven guilty out the window. In other words, it makes it next to impossible for a defendant, if they are, in fact, innocent, to actually prove his innocence.</p> <p>By the same token, it makes it impossible for an attorney to mount an effective defense. Gareth Pierce, the lawyer representing Babar Ahmad et al, has described the effect of Sams on any lawyer's ability to do his or her job as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It makes it much harder for lawyers to do a proper investigative job, interview witnesses and so on, if they are not allowed to share the evidence against the defendant and explore it. The other shocking aspect and a compelling reason why prison conditions under Sams seem so relatively unexplored is because lawyers aren't allowed to tell half of this story. Sams are crippling in every way, not just in terms of ability to prepare a trial.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>There's another, even more chilling reason for lawyers to be concerned about defending clients placed under Sams. Attorneys risk prosecution if they violate any of the terms of the Sams, and precedent has it that the sanction for any violations will be much more severe than the proverbial slap on the wrist. This past June, a ten-year prison sentence <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/nyregion/lynne-stewarts-10-year-prison-sentence-is-upheld.html?_r=0\">was upheld</a> in federal court for Lynne Stewart, a 73-year-old attorney who was convicted in 2005 of \"providing aid to terrorism\" for sharing statements from her client, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, with the media.</p> <p>The prosecution originally sought a 30-year sentence. Stewart, who has been treated for breast cancer, fears she will die in prison.</p> <p>The challenges for defendants under Sams is all too graphically illustrated by <a href=\"http://chronicle.com/article/My-Student-the-Terrorist/126937/\">the story of Syed Fahad Hashmi</a>, a political science student from Queens, New York, who, while completing his masters degree in London, was arrested for \"providing material support to terrorists\". This material support involved allowing an acquaintance to stay in his apartment for two weeks \u2013 an acquaintance who later delivered raincoats and waterproof socks to al-Qaida. Hashmi was extradited back to America, held in total isolation under Sams for three years at the notorious Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan as he awaited trial. One day before his trial, to the dismay of his many supporters, Hashmi, who was facing 70 years if convicted, agreed to a plea bargain of one count of conspiring to provide material support. He was sentenced to 15 years, which he is now serving, in total isolation, at ADX.</p> <p>You can see why Babar Ahmad and others who are charged with anything to do with alleged terrorism would fight extradition to the US at every avenue available to them. You can also see why their lawyers fear that justice will not be served if they are. It is we the people, however, who by being denied information, the opportunity to protect our civil liberties and to keep our government in check, who are the ultimate losers.</p>",
  "<p>We did our first stand up gig at a comedy night in Hull called Hullarity recently. I say 'we' \u2013 'The Johns' are two orphaned Scottish brothers, performed by Matt Sutton and Joe England, and I write and direct it with them (and press the laptop buttons on the night). The show featured a song, a bare arse and a piss bag. The best comment was from a woman in the front row, who said: \"I've seen too much\".</p> <p>It went down well, as did our films, 'The Johns' 10 uses of oats'. But the fact that the live set was probably better received than the films got us thinking.</p> <p>We've been doing online films for the last couple of years. Online is a great way to get material out there and find an audience. Recently there's been a massive increase in the amount of comedy online. For example, <a href=\"http://www.e4.com/themidnightbeast/\" title=\"\">E4's The Midnight Beast</a>, was picked up online. Commissioners and producers see the huge number of hits and think it is bound to be good if it's been watched so many times.</p> <p>In his keynote speech at the latest Just for Laughs comedy festival, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/justforlaughscomedy\" title=\"\">American stand-up comedian, Oswalt Patton, said</a> that new digital technology \u2013 coupled with YouTube, Twitter and podcasts \u2013 allowed comedians to create their own audiences. For him, online is a massive opportunity for comedians to forge their own careers without the involvement of the traditional gatekeepers. He told the assembled audience of TV executives: \"We don't need you\".</p> <p>But you can't hear the laughs online. It would be a mistake for comedians and producers to think that because of online, live comedy no longer matters. Stewart Lee <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/a8066bc2-6b9e-11e0-93f8-00144feab49a.html#axzz28FHappra\" title=\"\">wrote an article in the Financial Times last year against online comedy 'content'</a> and the way it reduced everything down to soundbites at the expense of form in a longer set. Hull stand-up and newcomer, Lucy Beaumont, headlined Hullarity and has just been signed by comedy talent agency and production company <a href=\"http://www.avalonuk.com/\" title=\"\">Avalon</a>, who represent the likes of Frank Skinner and Chris Addison. She's done a couple of online films, but she is also out pretty much every night gigging on the circuit. There is a view that doing comedy live is a route to TV or radio because that's generally where the money is. But the most important reason for gigging intensively like that, is to use it as a training ground for learning the craft and honing skills.</p> <p>When I tried to write some funny stuff, I put on my own live sketch show. It was only after listening to a room full of people laugh at something I'd written that I had the confidence to think it might be worth a try. If online was big then, I may have just concentrated on making comedy films and missed that chance. I wouldn't have got a small break into radio if a producer hadn't seen something I'd written performed live. It was the same the other night in Hull; all three of us felt that the gig went well \u2013 better than expected \u2013 and it's inspired us to do more.</p> <p>So, the trick is to do both (check out <a href=\"http://www.comedy.co.uk/website_links/\" title=\"\">the British Comedy Guide</a> for some useful sites promoting online and live). Online films are one way of being funny. Live is another. Do both. Whatever the form, the most important thing is to keep doing it, and if it's making somebody somewhere laugh then it's worth it.</p> <p><em>You can see more of Tom's work </em><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/thejohnscomedy\" title=\"\"><em>on Facebook</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/KetsMixedBag/videos?sort=p&amp;view=0\" title=\"\"><em>online here</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>When Andrew 'Freddie' Flintoff, dishevelled star of England's 2005 Ashes victory celebrations, recently announced his intention to become a heavyweight boxer for Sky1's The Gloves Are Off, the stunt was branded \"car-crash television\" by promoter Frank Warren. He was calling on a phrase that's come to mean any kind of compellingly awful TV spectacle \u2013 Freddie Flintoff Goes Wild, for instance, or those Morrisons adverts starring Freddie Flintoff \u2013 although Warren probably meant it more straightforwardly: watching Flintoff get pummelled in the face by a vastly superior opponent will be like rubbernecking a grisly automobile wreck.</p> <p>Literal car-crash TV already exists in the form of Pick TV's Road Wars, although personally I prefer the bits between the crashes, where two laconic traffic cops pootle around Slough handing out fixed penalty notices to surly boyracers and telling them to \"get those tinted windows sorted.\"</p> <p>Now Channel 4 has gone one better by inventing plane-crash TV. For the purposes of <strong>The Plane Crash </strong>(<em>Thursday, 9pm, Channel 4</em>), it's bought an old Boeing 727 passenger jet and crashed it into the Mexican desert to see what happens. When the focus is on the \"how\" rather than the \"why\", Plane Crash is giddily thrilling. Any fool can total a car, but it takes four years of meticulous planning by a team of aeronautical experts and elite former test pilots to crash a passenger plane without so much as a mini pretzel getting lodged in someone's eye. Enter a team of twinkly-eyed Top Gun archetypes called things like Chip and Jimbob, who are remarkably unfazed by the idea of parachuting out of a remote-controlled jumbo jet as it hurtles towards its doom at 150mph. It's like an edition of Brainiac: Science Abuse produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.</p> <p>But when the moment of impact arrives, with images of last month's Nepal air disaster fresh in the mind, it's an eerie rather than spectacular sight. This is not Richard Hammond blowing up a shed; mercifully, there are no high fives. As the air crash investigators move in, the whole tenor of the programme changes. Obviously, you can't write off 95 tonnes of liveried aluminium, putting the entire fire service of Baja California on standby, just for kicks. Plane Crash is also a serious experiment in airline safety, purporting to answer once and for all the question of whether to brace or not to brace. In lieu of passengers, the plane has been filled with state-of-the-art crash test dummies, whose death-plunge is captured by on-board cameras and then replayed over and over from multiple angles in slo-mo, to the point where it's not difficult to infer what would happen to them were they made of flesh and bone.</p> <p>These images are evidently useful to aeroplane designers, but throw in a few awkward interviews with traumatised crash survivors and it begins to to veer uncomfortably close to disaster porn. What next? The deliberate sinking of a cross-channel ferry in order to ascertain if anyone really understands what a \"muster point\" is? The destruction of a nuclear power plant and subsequent cordoning off of an entire former Soviet state for the next 50 years, just to see how much radiation an ecosystem can take? I'd probably watch it. But only if punctuated, as on Road Wars, by amusingly drawn-out footage of a confused van driver repeatedly failing to provide an adequate breath sample.</p>",

South Korea's government has urged publishers to ignore requests to remove examples of evolution from secondary school textbooks. This follows a campaign by the Society for Textbook Revise (a creationist organisation), which argued that details about <a href=\"http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/horses/horse_evol.html\">horse evolution</a> and that cheekiest of potential bird ancestors, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeopteryx\">Archaeopteryx</a>, should be removed from textbooks. Thankfully for science and for the young adults of South Korea, these fascinating evolutionary tales will remain part of their education. Creationists of course will not be so happy with this inclusion of evidence. Well they wouldn't be would they? It would be like expecting badgers to be happy about reading evidence is being ignored in favour of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/28/badger-cull-bovine-tb\">culling</a>. Although you could argue a badger should be happy that it can read at all. </p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creationism\">Creationists</a>, for the unaware, hold the religious belief that humans, badgers, life and the universe were created by a supernatural being, usually if not always a God. The creation of all this marvellous stuff (and wasps) is described as taking place between 5,000 and 10,000 years ago. In this vision, no meaningful evolution has happened. Creationists typically don't like science. Probably only because the scientific consensus is that it is an evidence-based fact derived from multiple observations and experiments across multiple disciplines that the Earth has existed for at least <a href=\"http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/geotime/age.html\">4.5 billion years</a> with life existing for at least <a href=\"http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/the-beginnings-of-life-on-earth/1\">3.5 billion years</a>. In short science conclusively shows that a literalist interpretation of creationism is wrong. </p> <p>Back in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedrock_(The_Flintstones)\">Bedrock</a> I was on the <a href=\"http://idebate.org/\">university debating</a> team. As a side-note I would like to point out that I don't literally believe I lived in Bedrock or that the Flintstones was a historical documentary about humans living with dinosaurs. I may come to regret that sentence. Based on their past misquotations, I fully expect to see \"the Flintstones was a historical documentary about humans living with dinosaurs\" attributed to me in a creationist pamphlet. Or it would if I was even remotely quotable. </p> <p>So the debating team. My debating partner and I had got to a national competition final. To my dismay it was announced that we had to argue that creationism was a science. After some thought I decided to take this as the challenge it was. Is it possible to successfully argue that there is legitimate science behind creationism without lying or bending the truth?</p> <p>In this case it was not. I was and am aware of at least some of the evidence for evolution (vast) and the arguments for creationism (multiple but easily countered.) The arguments that I was aware of for creationism e.g. irreducible complexity, the improbability of life arising, the second law of thermodynamics and so on, have all been repeatedly deconstructed. There are no legitimate examples of<a href=\"http://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/design2/article.html\"> irreducible complexity</a>, the improbability of life arising has been banished because it had a long time to do so and you have to really misunderstand the <a href=\"http://entropysite.oxy.edu/students_approach.html\">second law of thermodynamics</a> to think it's an argument against evolution. I couldn't think of new arguments in favour of a scientific creationism and still can't. </p> <p>Luckily and somewhat shamefully there doesn't seem to be much of a rule in debating about the facts behind your evidence unless the opposing team comments. It is interesting to note that a lot of politicians have trained through this form of debating. You're more than welcome to be concerned and sit down for a reassuring cup of hot beverage. So I couldn't do it, but is it possible to argue creationism has scientific merit without lying. And does it matter?</p> <p>Somewhat predictably it does matter. If the only way possible to spread creationist ideas as science is lying then some very influential people have to be held to account. It would seem that in the past creationists have been successful in convincing people their views are scientifically valid. <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/155003/hold-creationist-view-human-origins.aspx\">Forty-six percent</a> of Americans believe in the creationist view. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/jul/17/creationist-groups-approval-free-schools\">Several schools</a> promoting creationism have been allowed to be set up in the UK. There have been <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_and_evolution_in_public_education_in_the_United_States\">multiple campaigns</a> by creationists to get evolution removed from science textbooks in USA schools. But the spread of creationist information as science rather than belief is the spread of information that is not factual. If someone had made me believe something that wasn't true, influencing national policy and education by lying, I'd be pretty annoyed. And I'm not that easily annoyed. I can sit through at least 5 seconds of <a href=\"http://talent.itv.com/\">Britain's Got Talent</a>. Perhaps there is certain smugness in declaring evolution as true and creationism as false. There are even those who would say arguing against these creationist arguments is to present <a href=\"http://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/strawman\">straw man arguments</a>. </p> <p>Unfortunately as we have seen there are a great many people believing and spreading untruths so maybe it is sometimes necessary to smugly punch a scarecrow to get to the real arguments.</p> <p>It is not true that all creationists are actively lying about science. To accuse the majority of lying is not only wrong but unhelpful and liable to alienate them from real arguments favouring evolution. It is more likely that some people are unaware of evolutionary science but hear creationist views, believe them and pass on scientific distortions. We can look at this group in two ways; believers unaware of evidence against creationism and believers who are aware and won't accept it. The latter group may be somewhat difficult to convince. Belief is usually not based on logic or evidence. That is somewhat the point we are told. But it is difficult to logically argue someone out of a position they didn't arrive at through logic. It is fine for people to believe what they want to believe but we run into problems when beliefs clash with facts. I can believe that I can walk through walls all I want. I can take comfort from this belief. I still have to live in a house with doors. It is the former group that we can make aware of the evidence and through decent and understanding science communication, convince of the truth.</p> <p>Attempts to display their own beliefs as proof can take creationists in peculiar directions. Some creationists it seems are on a campaign to \"take dinosaurs back.\" Creationist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Ham\">Ken Ham</a>, president of <a href=\"http://www.answersingenesis.org/\">Answers in Genesis</a>, an organisation that established the <a href=\"http://creationmuseum.org/\">Creation Museum</a>, said, \"Dinosaurs have been held hostage for decades.\" Where they've been taken and how is beyond me. Even an enlarged pair of handcuffs would be useless on a <a href=\"http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/prehistoric/tyrannosaurus-rex/\">Tyrannosaurus</a>. Mr Ham is determined to appropriate dinosaurs for literalist creationists and as such has included them in his museum, often shown frolicking with humans. He obviously didn't understand the subtext of Jurassic Park. But there's a problem. It has been shown that many <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/jul/05/feathers-dinosaurs-fossils\">dinosaurs had feathers</a>. Perhaps not surprisingly, the Creation Museum doesn't and refuses to feature feathery dinosaurs in their literature and museum. Creationists want to utilise dinosaurs' celebrity but refuse to accept many of them were feathered. Feathered dinosaurs are superb examples of evolution, and must have this interesting feature removed and fitted with a saddle for an imagined prehistoric jockey in order to comply with creationist stories. These misguided displays represent another attempt to disprove science that either has to be solely based on belief or active deceit. </p> <p>Regardless of whether they are consciously lying some good has come out of debate with creationists. As pointed out by geneticist Shane McKee in his <a href=\"http://answersingenes.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/in-praise-of-creationists.html\">blog</a>, some of the most persuasive evidence in our possession for evolution has been perfected for clear communication to the public by scientists attempting to tackle anti-scientific claims. Claims like those made in the presentation of dinosaurs in the Creation Museum. Most people are not scientists and cannot be expected to be aware of all of the latest evidence and competing viewpoints of evolutionary science. And of course we shouldn't just believe scientists either. Good scientists should welcome questioning and an exploration of their evidence. Those who previously believed in creationism but have engaged with this abundance of scientific evidence and changed their minds should be applauded as should those who are willing to even consider the evidence. For while technically you can believe and argue creationism has scientific merit without lying, you cannot do so without being wrong.</p> <p><em>Dave in his current form as an unfortunate product of evolution is on the twitter as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hullodave\">@hullodave.</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Strong economic growth in the past decade among African countries rich in oil and minerals has failed to make a significant dent on their poverty levels, according to a World Bank report.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2012/10/04/despite-global-slowdown-african-economies-growing-strongly-world-bank-urges-countries-spend-new-oil-gas-mineral-wealth-wisely\" title=\"\">Africa's Pulse, a twice-yearly analysis of Africa's economic prospects</a>, noted that the decline in poverty rates in resource-rich countries has generally lagged behind that of countries without riches in the ground. Some countries, such as Angola, Congo-Brazzaville and Gabon, have witnessed an increase in the percentage of the population living in extreme poverty.</p> <p>The report confirms the common perception that, to a large extent, the benefits of growth have not reached the poorest segments of society. It raises questions for aid donors and African governments on how to deal with the \"resource curse\", with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/26/south-african-goldmines-simmering-resentment\" title=\"\">strikes in South African mines providing a stark illustration of what is at stake</a>.</p> <p>\"Resource-rich African countries have to make the conscious choice to invest in better health, education, and jobs, and less poverty for their people, because it will not happen automatically when countries strike it rich,\" said Shantayanan Devarajan, the World Bank's chief economist for Africa, and lead author of Africa's Pulse. \"Gabon, for example, with a per-capita income of $10,000 (\u00a36,200) has one of the lowest child immunisation rates in Africa.\"</p> <p>How to ensure that natural resources benefit the general population, not just the elite, is a question likely to grow more acute as discoveries of oil, gas and other minerals in African countries are expected to generate considerable wealth in the future.</p> <p>The region's established oil producers represent less than 10% of the share of both global reserves and annual production. Nigeria, Africa's biggest oil producer, can keep supplying at 2011 levels for another 41 years, while Angola, the second largest producer in the region, has about 21 years remaining at current production levels before its known reserves are depleted.</p> <p>With such sizeable reserves, it is likely the dependence on oil resources in these countries will continue. Production in new mineral countries such as Ghana, Mozambique, Sierra Leone and Uganda could last for a substantial number of years.</p> <p>Others have considerable mineral resources. In 2010, Guinea represented more than 8% of total world bauxite production; Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have a combined share of 6.7% of the total world copper production; and Ghana and Mali together account for 5.8% of total world gold production.</p> <p>Africa's Pulse underlines the continent's heavy dependence on commodities for its recent growth, although domestic demand has played its part. Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to grow at 4.8% in 2012, broadly unchanged from 4.9% growth in 2011, and is largely on track despite setbacks in the global economy. Excluding South Africa, the continent's largest economy, growth in sub-Saharan Africa is forecast to rise to 6%.</p> <p>While African economies have not been immune to the crisis in the eurozone, the World Bank said consistently high commodity prices and strong export growth in countries with mineral discoveries in recent years have fuelled economic activity and are expected to underpin economic growth for the rest of the year.</p> <p>A measure of the continent's economic success is strong investor interest. \"An important indicator of how Africa is on the move is that investor interest in the region remains strong, with $31bn in foreign direct investment flows expected this year, despite difficult global conditions,\" said Makhtar Diop, World Bank vice-president for Africa.</p> <p>The report noted that, after 10 years of high growth, an increasing number of countries are moving into \"middle-income\" status, defined as those countries reaching more than $1,000 per-capita income. Of 48 countries, 22 with a combined population of 400 million have officially achieved middle-income status.</p> <p>But there are risks, with a fragile global economic recovery posing the greatest threat. A \"hard landing\" for the Chinese economy would adversely affect growth prospects. Over the past decade, sub-Saharan exports to China have risen from 5% to around 19.3% in 2010, with producers of oil (Sudan, Congo) and metal and mineral exporters (Zambia, Mauritania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo) among countries heavily dependent on Chinese appetite for commodities.</p> <p>The report noted that oil-rich countries systematically perform worse than any other country groups in terms of voice and accountability, political stability, rule of law and the control of corruption. Chad and Sudan are the worst performers, according to the World Bank, and their governance indicators improved little between 2000-2010.</p> <p>Anti-poverty campaigners have been pressing for more transparency and accountability in the natural resource sector as a way of putting pressure on governments. A focus of such efforts is the <a href=\"http://eiti.org/\" title=\"\">Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative</a>, which provides an internationally-recognised framework for public disclosure by mining companies and governments of what they pay and earn respectively. However, the initiative is voluntary, leaving implementation to those who sign up.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/19/eu-tougher-transparency-law-extractive\" title=\"\">A European parliamentary committee last month approved a measure requiring EU oil, gas, mining and timber companies to publish their payments to foreign governments</a>. The vote puts the world on track to create strong global transparency standards with equivalent rules in the EU and the US.</p>",
  "<p>When Paul Cullen takes his seat at Old Trafford with his family on Saturday night to watch his nephew, Mike Cooper, walking out in Warrington's primrose and blue, his mind will drift back a decade to the start of the renaissance of one of British rugby league's proud old clubs.</p> <p>Cullen had played in a reasonably successful Warrington team in the 80s and 90s, and even worked on their commercial staff as his career wound down in the early Super League years, playing a part in the move to replace their traditional nickname of Wire with the more marketable Wolves. But in 2002 he had moved into coaching and was working in Cumbria with Whitehaven, and watched in growing alarm as his former club appeared to be sliding towards relegation.</p> <p>Off the field, some of the foundations of the current success that has seen Warrington reach their first ever Grand Final, in which they play Leeds Rhinos on Saturday evening, had already been laid. Planning permission had been secured for a huge Tesco to be built in the centre of town, which would in turn fund a new stadium, and a low-profile music promoter called Simon Moran had joined the board. But on it, Warrington continued to underachieve&#xa0;horribly.</p> <p>The decision was made to sack David Plange, the second coach to lose his job that season, and to call Cullen back from Cumbria. \"We had to win a game, possibly two,\" Cullen reflects. \"If we didn't, Warrington would have been relegated. It's taken 10 years to get to this point even having stayed up that year. Imagine how long it would have taken if we'd gone down. It really is anyone's guess.\"</p> <p>The dwindling band who advocate Super League's licensing process would perhaps point to that traumatic year as evidence of the perils of relegation \u2013 to the competition as a whole. Warrington have traditionally been among the elite if never as consistently successful as Wigan, St Helens or even Widnes, their three local rivals in what used to be south-west Lancashire \u2013 and still is, to a sizeable proportion of the club's supporters who refuse to join the Cheshire set. But now, with that new stadium built and recently extended to a 15,000 capacity, and Moran \u2013 or Moranovich, as those supporters know him \u2013 a hugely influential figure in the background, they have become one of the model clubs of the&#xa0;competition.</p> <p>There have been a number of other significant moments along their journey from relegation danger to Old Trafford. In 2003, Cullen's first full season in charge, they fulfilled his stated goal of leaving Wilderspool, their crumbling old home known as the Zoo, and even secured a first play-off appearance. Their first season at the Halliwell Jones, naming rights to the stadium having been sold to an upmarket local car dealership which is definitely more Cheshire than south-west Lancashire, was mixed, but the following year Moran sprinkled some stardust by funding a short-term move for Andrew Johns, the Australian scrum-half who was then the undisputed superstar of the game.</p> <p>Johns's stint was typical of Warrington's position at the time, however. He starred in a memorable debut against Leeds, but two weeks later was powerless to prevent a heavy home defeat by Hull in the first round of the play-offs.</p> <p>The Wolves developed an unfortunate habit of starting each season with great expectations, only to underachieve when it mattered, to the great delight of Wigan and especially St Helens.</p> <p>Cullen has every right to feel he was let down by players in whom he had placed considerable trust, most obviously Lee Briers, the wily and wonderfully watchable stand-off for whom an Old Trafford debut will represent personal fulfilment. It is hugely to Cullen's credit that he is not bitter about the fact that it needed a change of coach before Briers, and the club, finally delivered on their potential.</p> <p>He was driven out in acrimonious circumstances after a home defeat by Castleford in the summer of 2008, and initially succeeded by his assistant James Lowes \u2013 who has since revived his old partnership in the Bradford front-row with Brian McDermott at Leeds, providing another subplot this weekend. But it was only when Moran decided that Lowes was not the answer after a dreadful start to the following season that he made surely the best decision of his decade behind the scenes.</p> <p>Tony Smith, an Australian who had endured an unhappy World Cup in 2008 as the England coach having made his reputation by coaching Leeds to Grand Final victories in 2004 and 2007, was tempted by the opportunity to return to club management, especially at a club with such&#xa0;potential.</p> <p>Success came more quickly than either Smith or Moran could have envisaged: a Challenge Cup run through the summer of 2009 earned Warrington their first Wembley appearance since 1990 and victory over Huddersfield secured their first major trophy since 1974. They retained the cup the following season, and claimed a third Wembley win in four years by beating Leeds this August.</p> <p>But it is an Old Trafford appearance, and the right to call themselves champions for the first time since 1955, that Warrington's supporters have been craving.</p> <p>It has already been quite a year for Moran, who is probably best known in the music business for his leading role in Take That's triumphant comeback \u2013 Gary Barlow helped the Wolves celebrate one of their cup wins \u2013 but who was also responsible for the Stone Roses playing their secret comeback gig at Warrington's Parr Hall in May (Ian Brown, the lead singer, is a fellow Warringtonian, who has occasionally referred to a soft spot for the Wire).</p> <p>Moran rarely gives interviews to the Warrington Guardian, never mind this one, even though he is a regular in Smith's post-match press conferences, sitting quietly at the back, usually in jeans and a T-shirt having watched the game from the terraces \u2013 which he used to do at Wilderspool with his dad, having been bitten by the bug when attending the 1975 Challenge Cup final at Wembley (a 14\u20137 defeat to Widnes).</p> <p>During one such press conference this season, an older member of the press pack was surprised to see an \"I am the Resurrection\" sticker on the diary Moran was holding. \"I didn't know he was religious,\" the journalist pondered later \u2013 clearly unfamiliar with the Stone Roses.</p> <p>Cullen is young enough to know better, but even he inadvertently used the title of their second album in describing Moran's involvement at Warrington, which followed an earlier financial rescue by the Greenalls brewery and leisure group, as \"part of the second coming\".</p> <p>\"It's been a bit of a slow burner,\" Cullen added. \"I was always aware of Simon's fanatical support of the club when I worked there in various roles. But it was only when he came back around 2002 that you could sense something was going to change, and he was going to be a new, dynamic leader.</p> <p>\"The demographic of the club has completely changed since the days when I was commercial manager at Wilderspool. Then we had very male-orientated fan base but now, thanks to the move to the new stadium and all the facilities, old Warrington and new Warrington have come together in support of the Wolves. I genuinely feel this could be the start of a Warrington dynasty.\"</p>",
  "<p>No one becomes a sporting superstar alone. Behind them lies a legion of coaches, mentors and sports organisations. Likewise, development is a joint pursuit. Achieving public goals around education, health and other life-enhancing attributes requires a supporting infrastructure. So what happens when you bring the two together - sport and development - in genuine partnership?</p> <p>That was the question Guardian Sustainable Business put to a panel of experts. Poised at their keyboards and ready for debate were: Tom Burstow, head of International Inspiration, <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UNICEF UK</a>; Jon Long, head of executive programmes, <a href=\"http://www.internationalcricketcouncil.org/\" title=\"\">International Cricket Council</a> (ICC); John Shiels, chief executive, <a href=\"http://www.mufoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Manchester United Foundation</a>; Ned Wills, director, <a href=\"http://www.laureus.com/foundation\" title=\"\">Laureus Sport for Good Foundation</a>; Tim Vine, head of public affairs, <a href=\"http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb.html\" title=\"\">Premier League</a>; and Simon White, managing director at <a href=\"http://www.momentum-uk.org/\" title=\"\">Momentum UK</a>.</p> <h2>Getting the basics straight</h2> <p>Sport for development. Does the idea even stack up? Right off the bat, the panel found itself defending the basic premise of the debate. Long at the ICC was first to the defence. He pointed to a \"growing body of evidence\" that proves the \"social and financial return\" on investing in sport for development. He specifically cited academics <a href=\"http://us.macmillan.com/businessleadershipandthelessonsfromsport/HansWesterbeek\" title=\"\">Aaron Smith and Hans Westerbeek</a>, whose research highlights the unique ability of sports to generate social interaction, positive health impacts, cultural integration, and so on. Shiels of the Manchester United Foundation backed this up with the example of a football programme in Sierra Leone. Run in association with UNICEF and geared towards HIV/AIDS awareness, the initiative resulted in a 20% jump in condom use.</p> <p>Despite this and many other positive examples, the panel conceded that evidence from the sport-for-development field had to move from the anecdotal to the empirical. \"We do need to better communicate sport and its value, not just describing a generic benefit or catch all that sport is just great\", admitted UNICEF's Burstow. ICC's Long was equally frank about the problem. Inputs are much easier to capture than outputs, he conceded, \"particularly when working across a range of markets, cultures and languages\". However, Wills at Laureus Sport for Good Foundation insisted progress is being made around impact measurement. He points to InFocus, a bespoke system co-developed by Laureus for project management and global data collection. The system works by identifying output objectives up front, \"searching for evidence of those outcomes\" and then aggregating these across a range of programmes.</p> <h2>Establishing sound partnerships</h2> <p>The question of measurement is important, but it jumps the gun somewhat. If you're to measure impacts, you need to generate them first. And that requires effective partnerships. What do such partnerships look like? Vine of the Premier League pointed to two fundamental factors. One, find a partner that has reach. Two, find partners with local know-how. For the first, the Premier League turned to the British Council, which counts offices in over 100 countries. For the second, it identified a range of NGOs with \"vast experience on the ground\" - Right to Play in Africa, for instance, or the Rafa Marquz Foundation in Mexico. ICC's Long agreed that choosing an umbrella organisation with local expertise and \"bona-fide\" networks is essential. In ICC's case, UNICEF fitted that bill. \"With limited resource, it is pointless trying to re-invent the wheel\", he argued. \"It is far better to work with experts and recognised best in field.\"</p> <h2>Building a business case</h2> <p>Panelists also stressed the importance of mutual learning and shared benefits. \"The resources of large sporting organisations are of course invaluable for development programmes\", said a contributor from StreetFootballWorld, \"but the real benefit is in the exchange of knowledge and experience.\" Wills felt Laureus' Coach Across America programme with Mercedes Benz illustrates that point exactly. The automaker has its eye on the next generation of car buyers. By working with youth in under-served communities in the US, it is \"talking now to [its] future customers\". Clearly there needs to be a business incentive for companies to get involved, otherwise it all comes down to the whims of \"the Chairman's chequebook\", said Long. Firms need to consider what media coverage they might gain, for example, or what employee or product benefits might emerge. \"It can sound a bit brutal but at the end of the day, unless the company is indulging the chairman's passion, it will boil down to a business decision\", Long spelt out. Not that philanthropy isn't important. The Premier League's Vine was keen to rebuff the \"misconception\" that football clubs only invested in youth programmes so as to find the next Didier Drogba. Clubs and players genuinely want to help young people play football or gain an education, he said.</p> <h2>Leaving a lasting legacy</h2> <p>A number of readers voiced about financial sustainability. What happens when the funding finishes? With the focus now squarely on sport and \"social legacy\", it's a legitimate question. \"Chucking a few free T-shirts and some signed photos around is NOT the way to go\", White at Momentum UK stressed. While it was widely agreed that sport-stars can bring kudos and coverage to development projects, White urged against \"shallow engagement\" that relies too heavily on \"the fame of sport\". Better, said ICC's Shiels, to ensure that long-term building blocks are in place. That means stadia and sports facilities, of course. But it also means competent local personnel. As he put it: \"In many instances we would like to train local people, so that if and when funding stops we have people in place locally to take it on.\"</p> <p>Lessons can also be learned from International Inspiration, the London 2012 Olympics' primary legacy programme. So said Burstow of UNICEF, which is heavily involved in the initiative. Where short-term impacts mature into long-term outcomes is when government gets involved, he argued. For that reason, UNICEF is working with town and city mayors in Brazil ahead of the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics to encourage them to invest in \"opportunities for sport and play\". Vine of the Premier League reinforced the point. The League's flagship Premier Skills project seeks to involve the ministries of youth, education and sport wherever possible. \"It is important that Govts [sic] understand the work we are delivering, and hopefully feel compelled to build on what we have started.\" Oh, and don't forget to involve young people themselves. \"Rigid\" and \"inflexible\" projects \"set up by a load of 'suits' with little understanding\" won't go the distance, Vine warned. \"Much better that the youngsters involved are at the heart of it, feel ownership of it, and become key people in driving it forward.\"</p> <p>To read the full discussion, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/partnerships-sporting-development-organisations-live-discussion\" title=\"\">please click here</a>.</p> <p><em>Oliver Balch is author of </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780571259250\" title=\"\"><em>India Rising: Tales from a Changing Nation</em></a><em>, published by Faber</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<h2>1) <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VI-M9Yw-28\" title=\"\">Marvin Hagler v Thomas Hearns, first round, Las Vegas, 15 April 1985</a> (Hagler won by third-round knockout)</h2> <p>It was billed, simply, as The Fight. Marvellous Marvin Hagler, the undisputed middleweight champion of the world and unbeaten since 1976, against the world's best light-middleweight, Tommy 'The Hitman' Hearns.</p> <p>Hagler could box, brawl, switch-hit, punch \u2013 and his shaven skull seemed impervious to pain. Few disputed his claim never to have been hurt in the ring. Even so, many smart analysts believed Hearns possessed the tools to trouble him: he was four inches taller, a smart boxer and his outstanding record \u2013 40-1 with 35 knockouts \u2013 advertised his punching power. Hearns was briefly a betting favourite in the week leading up to the fight. The big question was, could he use his physical advantages to outbox Hagler?</p> <p>The Caesars Palace crowd never got a chance to find out. In the ring beforehand, Tommy's brother Billy taunted Hagler as he shadowboxed. \"I saw him,\" Hagler said later. \"I was thinking right then: 'All you're gonna do is get your brother's ass kicked.'\"</p> <p>Hagler was as good as his word. He leapt off his stool and threw a hard right, which missed, followed by a left to the body that sent Hearns towards the ropes. As Hugh McIllvaney wrote in the Observer: \"The fighter who had come off the stool at him when the first bell sounded was not a Marvin Hagler anyone had ever seen before. He was a man possessed, the very incarnation of furious hostility, an enemy who shrank the ring with the heat of his malevolent intent.\"</p> <p>Hearns, who believed that a pre-fight massage had weakened his legs, decided he had no choice but to pour hot oil on Hagler's raging fire.</p> <p>He threw four hard right hands in a row, including a brutal uppercut that forced Hagler to clinch. In a matter of seconds the pattern had been set, the rules of combat laid down: Hagler the hunter, Hearns firing back at every opportunity. The gasps from the crowd whenever a punch landed told their own story.</p> <p>With just over a minute left of the round, Hagler was cut on the top of his forehead. Unbeknown to anyone, Hearns had also broken his right hand on Hagler's skull. But they continued to unload bombs, with Hagler wobbling Hearns just before the bell, before glaring at him as he walked back to his corner.</p> <p>As McIllvaney wrote: \"Hooks, swings and anything else that might rock or demoralise Hearns were hurled across with what might have been mistaken for wild abandon. In fact, only Hagler's spirit was really wild, for there was always a pronounced element of calculation in what he did with those powerful arms \u2026 the surge of mayhem seemed to go on forever\".</p> <p>It was all too much for Harry Mullan, the editor of Boxing News, who confessed: \"I was praying for it to end, I thought I was going to have a heart-attack.\"</p> <p>Unsurprisingly Hagler, never a sentimentalist, took a different view. \"I was sorry to see that round end,\" he said. \"I hated to give Tommy a chance to go back to his corner and recover.\"</p> <p>Two rounds later, Hagler got his man, chopping him down to the canvas.</p> <p>But Hearns played his part too. As his trainer Emanuel Steward later revealed: \"After the first round his hand was broke and his legs were gone. But that night Tommy told me not to mention anything about the hand. He said he didn't want to take anything away from Hagler's victory. That's the kind of guy Tommy was.\"</p> <h2>2) <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NN0vGHnCLo&amp;feature=related\" title=\"\">Jack Dempsey v Luis Angel Firpo, first round, New York, 14 September 1923</a> (Dempsey won by second-round knockout)</h2> <p>\"Has there ever been a fighter quite like the young Dempsey? \u2014 the very embodiment of hunger, rage, the will to do hurt; the spirit of the Western frontier come East to win his fortune\" asked Joyce Carol Oates in her book On Boxing. Not on this day. Not perhaps ever.</p> <p>In 1916 Jack Dempsey arrived in New York as a nobody with less than $30 in his pocket. Three years, and several adventures later, he was heavyweight champion of the world. By 1923 he was the biggest star of boxing's first golden age. His nickname, the Manassa Mauler, gave advance warning of his intentions; in the ring, his fists rarely did.</p> <p>His opponent, Luis Angel Firpo \u2014 who was three inches taller and 30lb heavier \u2014 had earned his shot at the title having won 13 fights in 17 months, mostly by knockout. Firpo was billed by Dempsey's promoter, Tex Rickard, as the Wild Bull of the Pampas. Not everyone in the fight game was convinced \u2013 the Argentinian enjoyed eating more than anything else and reporters noted how he would \"stuff himself to bursting point, point, pause, ask for more, and then drop off to sleep\" \u2014 but the public certainly were. 86,000 people crammed into New York's Polo Grounds for the fight, and it needed hundreds of mounted police to maintain order.</p> <p>Just before the men entered the ring, Rickard came to see Dempsey in his dressing room and told him: \"We got another million dollar gate! If you put him away with the first punch, all those people out there won't get their money's worth.\"</p> <p>\"Listen Tex \u2026 Firpo is a slugger,\" replied Dempsey. \"He could kill me with one punch.\"</p> <p>\"But, Jack, how is he going to hit you? He's slow and hits like an old tub. I hate to think of all them nice millionaires going out here sore at both of us.\"</p> <p>\"Go to hell!\"</p> <p>In the ring the two boxers shook hands, paused for photographs, and then set about tearing strips off each other. As the bell sounded, Dempsey charged at his bigger opponent, who cuffed him to the ground with his giant fists. It was a flash knockdown, and Dempsey bounced back up and into range: bobbing, weaving, sometimes holding, but mostly swinging. Firpo fired back, usually with an overhand right.</p> <p>Both men fought as if throwing a jab had been outlawed, and taking a voluntary step backwards would leave a permanent stain on their masculinity.</p> <p>A thudding right to the body put Firpo down for a three count. Clubbing left hooks and right uppercuts, from close range, dropped him for a second and third time. Yet the Argentinian got up and kept throwing bombs. Dempsey \u2014 the faster man \u2014 responded with more violence. A hurtful hook to the body left Firpo on the canvas for the fourth time, arms outstretched overhead and body occasionally twitching as if a low current were running through it. Somehow he got up at nine. In those days, there was no neutral corner \u2014 a rule that was only brought in after this fight \u2014 so as Firpo staggered up, Dempsey put him down for the fifth time.</p> <p>Firpo remained determined to live up to his nickname. A wild overhand right sent Dempsey tipsy, and although the American's gloves touched the floor, no count was administered. The brawl continued. A right cross knocked Firpo down for a sixth time; a short left uppercut put him down for the seventh time a few seconds later.</p> <p>\"He wouldn't stay down \u2014 the lust to kill was burning in his eyes, and nothing was going to stop him,\" remembered Dempsey in his autobiography. Suddenly he was hit with an overhand right. Then another. And another, which sent him flying through the ropes and on top of the sportswriters and their typewriters below.</p> <p>As Dempsey later remembered. \"Everyone was yelling. It was pitch dark for a few seconds, then I managed to focus on Firpo's fuzzy form in the ring. I don't remember climbing back in the ring but I remember seeing about 20 Firpos standing in front of me.\"</p> <p>Dempsey survived to the bell. \"I mumbled to [his trainer] Doc [Kearns]: 'What round was I knocked out in? What's all the fuss?'\"</p> <p>\"'You son of a bitch, you weren't knocked out! Get in there fast and box this guy. Finish it!' I crashed a left to his jaw and Firpo went down as if he had been struck by lightning.\"</p> <p>The fight was over 57 seconds into the second round. \"Every blow Firpo landed staggered me,\" admitted Dempsey. But he survived. Dempsey was always a survivor.</p> <h2>3) <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEhrsX_vDPs\" title=\"\">Riddick Bowe v Evander Holyfield I, 10th round, Las Vegas, 13 November 1992</a> (Bowe won by unanimous decision)</h2> <p>By late 1992, Evander Holyfield was the head of a church with few believers. After knocking out a blubbery Buster Douglas to become a heavyweight champion, Holyfield had gone the distance twice against Larry Holmes and George Foreman (combined age: 84) and had been rocked to his soles by Smoking Bert Cooper, before rallying to win in seven.</p> <p>Most regarded Holyfield as a puffed-up cruiserweight with Venice Beach muscles \u2014 and Mike Tyson, by now festering in prison after being convicted of rape, as the true champion.</p> <p>No one doubted that Riddick Bowe, all 6ft 5in of him, was a genuine heavyweight. Or that he had decent skills and a weighty clip. But the same knocks were heard repeatedly. The laziness. The ill-discipline. The fact that every time he saw a cake he wanted to eat it. But after what Bowe's manager Rock Newman called the best training camp ever, he was ready.</p> <p>The fight was always close and enthralling, but by the time the ninth was put to bed Bowe appeared to have an answer for everything that was put to him. When Holyfield stayed on the outside he was out-jabbed; up close he was out-powered by a man 30lb heavier.</p> <p>The bell sounded for the 10th. The fighters entered mid-ring. Bowe stuck with a right to the body followed by a uppercut of such viciousness it sent Holyfield's legs tumbling towards the ropes and his senses into la-la-land. Somehow Holyfield stood upright, taking the licks, before daring to walk forward towards Bowe, a manoeuvre that appeared as futile as a first world war private marching towards machine gun fire.</p> <p>\"He hit me so hard, and my eyes were swollen up so I couldn't see,\" remembers Holyfield. \"Riddick Bowe used to be my sparring partner. He was a smart fighter with good hand speed, but he was known for running out of gas. Why didn't he run out of gas? [But] if you can still feel the pain, then you're still in the game. It's when you don't feel the pain you're out.\"</p> <p>Finally, after nearly two minutes of constant pressure, \"the storm got quiet\", to use Holyfield's evocative phrase. \"Uh-no, now, oh boy, I'm gonna hurt you,\" he said to himself. And for the last 30 seconds of the round he did just that, slinging potshots from every angle.</p> <p>Just for good measure, the pair were still going several seconds after the bell. As they were finally separated, Bowe gave Holyfield an affectionate tap. \"I was impressed with him, you know, so I patted him on the stomach to say well done,\" he said afterwards.</p> <p>It looked as if Holyfield was on top. But he had little left to give. He was down in the 11th and lost a wide points decision 115-112, 117-110, 117-110. Holyfield had been doubted before, when he moved up to heavyweight, and he would be doubted again, particularly before his first fight with Mike Tyson in 1996. But after such a defiant and belligerent stand, few would ever claim he was a puffed up cruiserweight ever again. He was the Real Deal.</p> <h2>4) <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZP-IfSZxl0\" title=\"\">Micky Ward v Arturo Gatti I, ninth round, Uncasville, Connecticut, May 18 2002</a> (Ward won by majority decision)</h2> <p>Can a contest between two evenly matched boxers ever be too brutal? So savage that, even as a fan, you grimace while admiring the seemingly limitless capacity to absorb punishment? If so, the ninth round of the first fight in the Micky Ward v Arturo Gatti trilogy is a category-one case study.</p> <p>All 10 rounds were a blue-collar brawl par excellence. Subtlety was tossed into the wash bucket at the opening bell. Defence became an unfathomable foreign language. And the ninth? Well, that was something else. The Compubox stats showed that Gatti landed with 42 of 61 power punches, with Ward connecting with 60 of 82. As the two men staggered back to their corners, Emanuel Steward, breathless and high on adrenaline, announced: \"This should be the round of the century.\"</p> <p>When Gatti was dropped by a Ward left to the body after 15 seconds, Steward didn't think he could survive, warning: \"It's not like a head shot.\" But survive Gatti did. Despite blinking out of his right eye, he fought back. Every hook to the body had Ward nodding in grim appreciation. For a time he was pinned to the ropes, taking punishment, before landing two enormous rights.</p> <p>This was a Rocky film played for real. When the HBO commentator Jim Lampley announced: \"Can you believe there's still a minute and a half to go in the round?\" he was merely echoing the stunned thoughts of those watching.</p> <p>Ward was dominating to such an extent that, according to Eric Raskin, the former managing editor of the Ring, Gatti's trainer Buddy McGirt <a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7945073/on-10-year-anniversary-gatti-ward-rewatching-one-greatest-boxing-matches-all-time\" title=\"\">\"climbed the steps, white towel in hand, prepared to stop the fight with about 30 seconds to go\"</a> but the referee Frank Cappuccino didn't see him.</p> <p>And so it went on. Gatti survived. Ward won the fight by a split decision. And the two men went on to do it twice more, with Gatti getting his revenge and then winning the rubber match.</p> <h2>5) <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpLOS9aB0uU&amp;feature=relmfu\" title=\"\">Marco Antonio Barrera v Erik Morales I, fifth round, Las Vegas 19 February 2000</a> (Morales won by split decision)</h2> <p>After sharing an emergency room in a Connecticut hospital following their first fight, Ward and Gatti became close friends and golfing buddies. Dempsey, meanwhile, recalls his delight at meeting Firpo again in Argentina 1960. At the end of his visit Firpo \"draped his massive arm across my shoulders ... and handed me an envelope, telling me not to open it until I reached New York ... Ripping it open I found, in large denominations, $20,000, with a note simply stating: 'Just a small token of friendship and appreciation from one old friend to another ...'\"</p> <p>This is hardly unique. Smashing 50 shades of black and blue into each other, and them becoming good mates, is what boxers often do. But not Barrera and Morales, whose shared antipathy has remained undiminished by 36 rounds of combat or the passing of time. The animosity surfaced when Barrera called Morales \"an Indian\" on a Mexican TV. Morales retaliated by suggesting Barrera was a homosexual after which <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iKKEdWsusc\" title=\"\">Barrera did this</a>. Both were Mexican legends; both wanted to be top dog.</p> <p>In the ring, though, the pair were a perfect couple. Technically gifted, highly-energetic, and with a thirst for combat that would have impressed Pancho Villa. When Arturo Gatti was asked about his favourite fight of all time, he plumped for Barrera v Morales I, which was named Fight of the Year by Ring magazine. And the fifth round \u2014 a fast-handed, back-and-forth technical slugfest of the highest order -was the pick of the bunch.</p> <h2>6) <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvYHVRqpjfw&amp;feature=related\" title=\"\">George Foreman v Ron Lyle, fourth round, Las Vegas, 24 January 1976</a> (Foreman won by KO in the fifth)</h2> <p>George Foreman the brutaliser. George Foreman the bully. George Foreman slain at Muhammad Ali's feet. These are the enduring images of Foreman in the 1970s. As usual, Hugh McIllvaney's description of him \u2013\"a man who shrinks the ring the moment he rises from the stool, and punches as if he has promised to deliver his victim piece by piece to someone in the tenth row\" \u2013 was on the money.</p> <p>Most of Foreman's opponents \u2013 famously Joe Frazier, twice, and Kenny Norton \u2013 were swatted away with the impatient disdain of a brute annoyed by a pesky fly. Even Ali, who beat him brilliantly, absorbed huge amounts of punishment before finishing what was left of him in the eighth. Arguably only Ron Lyle went at it toe-to-toe, blow-for-blow, with Foreman in his near-prime, in a half-forgotten classic.</p> <p>Lyle, one of 19 brothers and sisters, only turned pro at 30 after spending seven years in prison for second degree murder following the shooting of a rival gang member. \"We were all in it together. I was involved,\" Lyle told the Denver Post, before admitting he could have received a reduced sentence if he had revealed the killer. \"But where do you live after that?\" While inside Lyle was also stabbed in the stomach, and was twice pronounced dead on the operating table. After what he had gone through, fighting Big Bad George was a breeze.</p> <p>Lyle had already had one shot at the world title, losing to Ali after being stopped while ahead, while Foreman was having his first proper fight \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoCOun7dx8g\" title=\"\">there had been a farcical exhibition where he boxed five times in one night</a> \u2013 since the Rumble in the Jungle.</p> <p>The fight started steadily; Lyle hurt Foreman, who was sluggish and easy to hit, in the first, Foreman, returned the compliment in the second, the third was split. And then came the incredible fourth stanza.</p> <p>First Lyle felled Foreman with a seven-punch combination: right to the body, left hook, right hand, right uppercut, left hook, right hook, left hook, every shot laced with venom. But Foreman, who had a remarkable chin, recovered, and was soon trading blows in the middle of the ring. Three left hooks had Lyle's head wobbling; a hard right put him away.</p> <p>Somehow Lyle rolled himself over and clawed himself up. But he looked spent. Foreman spent the next minute firstly prodding away at him on the ropes, looking for the finisher, before \u2013 incredibly \u2013 connecting with seven consecutive left hooks. In desperation, Lyle throw a Hail Mary left hook in retaliation before, after another wild exchange, dropping Foreman again with just three seconds to go in the round.</p> <p>\"I'll never forget that night, Ronnie Lyle is the hardest puncher I've ever been in with,\" said Foreman, who afterwards admitted he was \"rusty\", adding: \"There's no substitute for action in the ring. Whether you are a piano player or a boxer you've got to have action.\"</p> <p>The fifth round was just as brutal, with both men staggered again before Foreman sent Lyle face-first into the canvas to finish the fight. Unsurprisingly, the Ring Magazine made the fourth and fifth rounds joint-winners of their 'best round of 1976' poll.</p>",

Over the years there have been countless 'golden ages' for national teams who never did anything with it (the most glaring being England not building its team around Scholes, instead relying on the dire 'partnership' of Gerrard &amp; Lampard).\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18670561\">Paul replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Belgium are indeed blessed with stacks of excellent players at the moment and all, according to Jan Vertonghen when asked about it by a gathering hacks last week, thanks to pure luck: he reckons the federation and clubs have done nothing in particular to cultivate such a gifted generation. And the act that all of the players came up through different routes (including clubs in France and Holland from their young teens) suggests he's right. </p> <p>As for their performances so far, attitude has been diabolical on many occasions but there are signs that they are getting themselves together in that respect, even if there is unquestionably still a couple of divas in the team. </p> <p>The one area where they are not yet great is in the striker positions: the likes of Lukaku, De Bruyn and Mirallas have lots of potential but are not yet deadly enough to finish all the chances they create. Vertonghen said last week they could win the World Cup: doing so may entail replicating France 98 or Spain '12</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>12.36pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18668489\">Legaff</a> asksa about John Terry: <strong>\"Warrior.

Surely brave would have be owning up pronto to a terrible error, if that is what it was, rather than trying to brazen it out through smoke and bluster.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>12.43pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18670221\">Definatelynotashark</a> asks: <strong>\"How much do you hate Trappatoni and who would you replace him with?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18670822\">Paul replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>I don't hate Trapattoni: he a very lovable character an many ways and there's no doubt his charisma, vigour and rigour were exactly what Ireland needed after the sadly shambolic Stan Misunderstanding. But that was only the first step and his refusal to take the next one, apparently due to his conviction that Ireland are rubbish, is infuriating. </p> <p>Ireland are no world beaters, but his belief that they are worse than they are is self-validating, insfoar as it makes them appear worse than they are. If you were to try to set out to make Ireland look as bad as possible, the team and strategy you picked would not be far from Trap's.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>12.52pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18670842\">Citizenthirdmankane</a> asks: <strong>\"Chelsea for the Premier League, no?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18671101\">Paul replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Possibly, but, aside from a few players (e.g. Mata, Ivanovic, Cech), they haven't played consistently well this season and have been quite lucky in some of their wins. And it'll be interesting to see how long they can keep getting results without a proper striker. Reckon January can;t come soon enough for Di Matteo.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>12.58pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18671018\">seb202</a> asks: <strong>\"Any chance for Villa this weekend or are Tottenham going to swat them away and go on a roll in the Premier League? Do you think Lambert dropped Bent to try and get a response out of him and improved performances, or do you think they've had a falling out?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18671304\">Paul replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Firstly, I'm not sure what to make of Tottenham yet: they have been excellent in patches and bizarrely listless in others. They sure haven't had many solid 90-minute performances and at times the players look not so much tired as muddled. AVB speaks with great fluency but not always with great clarity: well, in press conferences anyway: if he talks like that in the dressing room I wouldn't be surprised if some players were occasionally confused. But it would be rash to draw any conclusion at so early a stage in his reign: he needs time. And, by the way, I think his handling of the Friedel/Lloris thing has been fine.</p> <p>I don't know whether Lambert and Bent had a falling out. I do know that, as in much of last season, in the first couple of games of this campaign Villa's midfield found it very hard to get the ball to Bent. Personally it seemed to me that that was because their own lack of imagination: Bent seemed to be making the same runs he always has (including some that were onside!) but just wasn't getting the service. Guess it's easier to get the ball to big Benteke and ultra-fast Aggonlahor, but,as you suggest, neither of them has the finishing prowess of Bent.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>1.02pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18671217\">Friggity</a> continues the debate about Chelsea: <strong>\"You are saying Ashley Cole hasn't played consistently well? Or Mikel?\"<br></strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18671443\">Paul replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>I just gave a few examples that sprang to mind. Cole has played consistently well, although I would like to see him attack much more, especially as with Oscar, Hazard &amp; Mata in the side, there is even more onus than before on the full-backs to provide width. His goal against Stoke notwithstanding, Cole has not done this as well as Ivanovic. Defensively, of course, he has still been very good. </p> <p>Mikel has had a decent season too, although in the first couple of games I was amused at how cavalier he suddenly became, as if the joy of playing with the aforementioned attacking trio suddenly reminded him that in his youth he was a nifty sort too, before Mourinho and the ordeal of the squabble over him between United and Chelsea seemed to cow him.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>1.09pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18670856\">Carfreewalker</a> asks: <strong>\"Paul, are Liverpool getting any better? They are playing better football than last year, but surely Rodgers needs to address the individual errors?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18671604\">Paul replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Yes. Because they are at least starting with the right intentions, which Hodgson (although I backed his appointment at the time) and Dalglish didn't. Rodgers has shown the courage of his convictions, both in the way he has set out to play and in the personnel he selects, and Liverpool fans and directors should show similar courage and give him time to bring them to fruition. And a bit more money would surely help too. Although the case of Borini hasn't bolstered his bargaining power much so far...</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>1.15pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18671194\">Ian Patten</a> asks: <strong>\"Can Sunderland replicate there stunning 3-3 performance from last season at Man city tomorrow?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18671789\">Paul replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Sure they can. I'd even say they could win if I thought they could defend better.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>1.18pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18671587\">OThilonthehill</a> asks: <strong>\"Of the two challengers to the Champions League participants this year, do you agree that Everton have a better first 11, and possibly a better squad, than Tottenham?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18671965\">Paul replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>It's a close call. Kyle Walker v Tony Hibbert? Hmmn. Certainly Everton have greater cohesion and dynamism than Spurs currently do. Also, Spurs would have been a better team last season if Redknapp has given Pienaar a proper chance. Him on the left with Bale as a marauding full-back (similar to Baines for Everton) would have been top. Vertonghen has shown glimpses of that sort of action recently.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 13 --> <p>1.22pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18671874\">RazzleDazzler</a> asks about the Manchester United midfield: <strong>\"It has been frustrating for at least the last three seasons seasons, with the problem getting more and more pronounced in terms of impact on performances and trophy prospects. Why is Ferguson not addressing this most obvious of problems?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18672064\">Paul replies</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>I am as mystified as you.

  "<p>More fallout from the West Coast franchise fiasco.</p> <p>Engineering and design firm <strong>WS Atkins</strong> has fallen nearly 4% after reportedly being involved as technical adviser to the Department of Transport. The franchise was taken away from the winner, <strong>FirstGroup</strong>, after irregularities in the bidding process which has already led to the suspension of a number of civil servants. Now the Times has said Atkins - along with law firm Eversheds - had been hired in January to give technical advice on the franchise process for the West Coast line, and its role was now being investigated.</p> <p>News of its possible involvement has sent Atkins shares 29p lower to 700p. David Brockton at Espirito Santo said:</p> <blockquote> Should any review find Atkins to have been at fault during this tender process, then clearly it could have a negative reputational impact for the group, given this represents a high profile tender. <br> </blockquote> <p>Andy Brown at Panmure Gordon added:</p> <blockquote> [The report] is unlikely to be helpful for the share price in the short term. That said, Atkins has strong rail expertise so we expect it to continue to play an active role in a strategically important infrastructure sector over the medium term. <br> Previously it suffered from negative sentiment surrounding its involvement in Metronet [the Tube consortium] but that did not stop it winning future government related work. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile FirstGroup is down another 2.8p to 197.8p having lost 20% on the day the franchise was withdrawn.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Peter Czapp is co-founder of </strong><a href=\"http://www.thewowcompany.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>the WOW Company</strong></a><strong>, an accountancy practice that advises small businesses across the UK</strong></h2> <p><strong>Are you better off as a sole trader or a limited company?</strong> I'd check that working as a sole trader is the most tax-efficient way of operating. As a general rule, once your profit rises above \u00a325,000 per year as a sole trader, you are better off becoming a limited company. You'd pay about \u00a31,500 per year less in tax, and there are other benefits of going limited too.</p> <p><strong>Save money to pay your tax bill:</strong> When it comes to putting money aside, I'd definitely set up separate bank accounts so it's easy to keep track of what money is not yours to spend.</p> <h2><strong>Daniel Mepham is a director at </strong><a href=\"http://www.clearskyaccounting.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>ClearSky Accounting</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>The main options for bookkeeping are:</strong></p> <p><strong>Manual records:</strong> Buy a bookkeeping book from most stationers and write up your records using pen and paper. The benefit is it's cheap, but the main drawbacks are that as you only have one copy of your records, it's harder to interpret the data (for you to keep an eye on your business) and it could be more prone to error.</p> <p><strong>Using Excel:</strong> I've worked with many small businesses that use a simple Excel spreadsheet to keep their records. Again this is cheap but unless you're a bit of an Excel whizz or prepared to spend a bit of time setting it up it won't feedback some key figures that you might want to know (such as profits and tax liabilities).</p> <p><strong>Software packages:</strong> Probably the most well known, and with the best support available, is Sage. This will deal with pretty much all of your bookkeeping, VAT, management accounts and so on. However, it will take a bit of learning if you're not familiar with it. There are loads of courses and tutorials out there.</p> <p><strong>Bespoke:</strong> Some accountants have their own bespoke packages. For example, we have a free online portal for our clients to use. This allows then to input their accounting information, and this will feed into the management accounts, VAT and so on that the accountant prepares.</p> <p><strong>You might be able to get an extension for VAT payments:</strong> In some circumstances HMRC will grant an extension for VAT payments. You'll need to give them a call explaining your circumstances and hopefully agree a payment plan. There are other things that you can do to delay payments that might be a bit easier. Are you registered for cash-based VAT? You'll only pay VAT on your cash receipts rather than invoices raised.</p> <p><strong>When looking for an accountant, make sure you check out their qualifications:</strong> For accountants in the UK, the most recognised qualifications are from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) or the Institute of Financial Accountants (IFA). For testimonials, some accountants may put these on their website, some you may need to ask. Or it could simply be from someone you know who is recommending their accountant.</p> <h2><strong>Simon Wood is a technical adviser for </strong><a href=\"http://www.accaglobal.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Your accountant can advise you on estimations: </strong>With regard to having enough funds to meet your tax liabilities, the approach that many businesses use is to estimate a percentage of profit or turnover that would typically be payable based on previous years' results. Your accountant will be able to advise on this.</p> <h2><strong>Clive Lewis is head of enterprise at </strong><a href=\"http://www.icaew.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Your relationship with your accountant is just as important after their appointment: </strong> After appointing your accountant, you should receive a letter setting out their terms and conditions. They should always keep in touch, not just at the end of the year, and you should reciprocate this by telling them as soon as possible of changes in your business, problems and circumstances. After your accounts have been prepared, you should receive a letter setting out future tax liabilities. And remember to review your accountant's charges every three to five years. From time to time, assess whether your accountant's services still match your business needs. If you are not getting what you want \u2013 ask. If you decide to sell your business, tell your accountant - they could plan to minimise tax liabilities and even help with the sale.</p> <h2><strong>Alison Ball manages the accountancy programmes for </strong><a href=\"http://www.intuit.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Intuit UK</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>The role of a bookkeeper is fluid: </strong>There is a potential role for the bookkeeper to act as a bridge between the small business owner and the accountant. This can be the case if the business owner wants to do some of their own day-to-day accounts (such as raising their own invoices) but may not want to pay their bills or keep track of their cashflow. The bookkeeper steps in and does the higher-level tasks, including month-end and quarter-end [figures], adjusting entries and reconciliation, but final accounts preparation and the tax return are done by the accountant.</p> <h2><strong>Georgette Rowland is the director of the </strong><a href=\"http://financialgymforbusiness.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Financial Gym</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>It's important to choose an accountant you get along with:</strong> Personality, I believe, is key. You will be divulging sometimes quite sensitive information with your accountant and too often I have clients complain that they do not like how their accountant deals with them and apart from price, it's a key reason they ask me for recommendations.</p> <p><strong>You can choose to outsource some elements and not others:</strong> Picking and choosing depends on your personal requirements, your understanding and frankly your willingness to do regular accounting. I often find initial enthusiasm can give way to frustration if the business person is time poor or needs to constantly check things. Not to mention what you want to control. The sales ledger is a common one that is controlled by the client because that is about making money, but they may shy away from bank reconciliations for example.</p> <h2><strong>Hannah Oliver is the owner of </strong><a href=\"http://www.h2oaccountants.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>H2O Accountants Ltd</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Consider what you'll gain by outsourcing:</strong> We have clients who outsource everything and pack their paperwork, invoices and bank statements into little plastic wallets monthly and we do all of the data input and VAT. We have others that only raise their own sales invoices as they know what to put on them and then we do the rest, even down to paying the staff and HMRC. We also have clients who input everything themselves onto an online package and we log on, check what they have done, make any adjustments, then run and submit their VAT return. Finally we have others who do all the accountancy side of the bookkeeping themselves and we simply run the payroll.</p> <p>I would suggest looking at the individual tasks which need to be done, consider whether they need to be done by you, and if they don't, consider whether your time would be better spent on developing the business and whether they are tasks that you want to do. I would then take this information to your bookkeeper or accountant and devise a plan that fits with your needs and your business.</p> <h2><strong>Garry Carter is the chief executive of the </strong><a href=\"http://www.bookkeepers.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Institute of Certified Bookkeepers</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Picking software is like picking a car</strong>: Some like Ford, some like Vauxhall, some want a Mercedes. They all do roughly the same job but it's the 'feel' that makes the difference. Sage is popular but is not for beginners, in my opinion. Quickbooks is a very good product and worth a try. Xero also provide a very simple package.</p> <p>Most have a free trial version. Give them a test drive. However, if you don't understand bookkeeping, please don't presume that software will make it simple. You still need to know the basics and it is possible to make big mistakes with only a little knowledge. Also make sure that whatever package you purchase is compatible with the package that your accountant or bookkeeper uses. If you talk to your bookkeeper, he or she might be able to licence you as a 'user' on his or her software. This can be very cost effective. And if you use a cloud (internet-based) system you can each have a live version of your accounts, which means that if you need information on a day when the bookkeeper is not in your office, it can all be talked through over the phone.</p> <p><em>The opinions provided by the experts in this Q&amp;A are for information purposes only.

  "<p>Life Line Screening's adverts are hard to miss. Over the past couple of years they have run in newspapers (including in the Guardian) headlined in massive font, \"Your quick and easy way to help prevent a stroke\" and urging you to speed along for a health check at a mobile clinic close to where you live.</p> <p>The company offers private tests \u2013 described on its website as \"<a href=\"http://www.lifelinescreening.co.uk/health-screening-services/default.aspx\" title=\"\">affordable, reliable preventive medical screenings</a>\" - to healthy people for a variety of conditions including heart disease, osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol and stroke.</p> <p>It typically floods a local area with personally addressed letters of invitation to a temporary clinic, typically in a church hall, providing ultrasound, ECG, blood testing and scans for \"osteoporosis risk\". The company <a href=\"http://www.lifelinescreening.co.uk/about-us/company-history.aspx\" title=\"\">claims to have screened half a million UK citizens</a> in 1,900 UK venues since it came over from the US in 2007.</p> <p>This is big business. Isn't it good for us, too? As a GP, shouldn't I be in favour of measures to spot serious illnesses early? The sentiment seems logical, but <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e2311.full?ijkey=OzLHzO5gq7L7wZK&amp;keytype=ref\" title=\"\">screening can be anything but</a>.</p> <p>The NHS offers many screening programmes, from the heelprick test for newborn babies to breast screening for women over 50. But screening - testing well people as opposed to people who already feel unwell or who have symptoms, like a lump, or palpitations - always has the potential to harm, and is a constant balance of pros and cons. There is a risk of false positives, false negatives and false reassurance, and the problem of sometimes giving people a diagnosis they don't need, or subjecting them to treatment they won't benefit from. Noninvasive tests may cause few hazards, but the way the knowledge from a positive or negative scan is used may result in harm to the patient for no benefit.</p> <p>We've <a href=\"http://annals.org/article.aspx?doi=10.7326/0003-4819-157-2-201207170-00459\" title=\"\">seen this in prostate cancer screening</a>: initial enthusiasm for PSA (prostate-specific antigen) screening was followed by the realisation that around a third of men operated on would suffer impotence as a result and a fifth would have incontinence.</p> <p>These might be acceptable risks if the treatment was death-delaying, but <a href=\"http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/07/21/jnci.djs299.abs\" title=\"\">most prostate cancers don't kill</a> and the evidence suggests that <a href=\"http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1103931\" title=\"\">PSA screening does not reduce death rates</a>.</p> <p>This led Richard Albin, who discovered PSA, to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/opinion/10Ablin.html\" title=\"\">tell the New York Times</a> that screening for it had been a \"public health disaster\" in the US.</p> <p>So screening is often counterintuitive and harmful. Because of these inherent problems, people need to make good choices about whether to be screened based on evidence. We know, for example, that when men are given better information about PSA screening, <a href=\"http://www.jmir.org/2010/3/e27/\" title=\"\">fewer want it</a>.</p> <p>Not only is there an ethical imperative on doctors to give fair information about screening \u2014 Britain's General Medical Council says that doctors should <a href=\"http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/good_medical_practice/good_clinical_care_index.asp\" title=\"\">base their medical care on the \"best available evidence\"</a> - but there is also reason to think that if people had fair information about the pros and cons, they might choose not to have it.</p> <p>And so to <a href=\"http://www.lifelinescreening.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Life Line Screening</a>, its dramatic claims, and adverts containing persuasive testaments from satisfied customers: \"I recommend this to anyone. No matter how healthy you might think you are, it could save your life.\" Strong stuff. No wonder I, and many other GPs, see a steady stream of Life Line Screening's customers and their results at our surgeries. As a letter to my home address from the company said, \"you don't usually get these tests on the NHS unless you have symptoms\" and, \"if anything is revealed we tell you straight away so treatment can be prescribed by your own GP.\" I think this is misleading, unfair, and alarmist advertising.</p> <p>Life Line Screening has declined to respond specifically to my concerns about its adverts, but did say that it is involved in researching the screening it does.</p> <p>\"We are deeply involved in research into the utility of screening,\" said the company's director of operations Dara Jordan. \"Our clinical team just recently presented at the XXV World Congress of the International Union of Angiology in Prague with original research and have published in several journals including the Journal of Vascular Surgery and the Annals of Surgery. There are also several ongoing research collaborations that will produce additional research, knowledge and engagement.\"</p> <p>The company has <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e2311?ijkey=OzLHzO5gq7L7wZK&amp;keytype=ref\" title=\"\">previously told the BMJ that it believes its adverts are fair and accurate</a>.</p> <p>I beg to differ. Take for example scanning the carotid artery \u2014 the main artery in the neck \u2014 which Life Line Scanning offers to completely well people. This is a useful test for people who have had a stroke, because if they have significant narrowing on the scan, an operation to clear this can <a href=\"http://summaries.cochrane.org/CD001081/carotid-endarterectomy-for-symptomati c-carotid-stenosis\" title=\"\">reduce the future risk of stroke due to narrowed arteries</a>.</p> <p>However, there are risks associated with the surgery used to clear the blockage \u2014 not least, ironically, a stroke. This may be a reasonable risk to take if the chance of stroke caused by the carotid narrowing is high. But for people who haven't had a previous stroke or a <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Transient-ischaemic-attack/Pages/Introduction.aspx\" title=\"\">ministroke</a>, the <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001923.pub2/abstract\" title=\"\">risks of causing harm outweigh the chances of benefit</a>, which is why the UK National Screening Committee doesn't recommend that the NHS provides it. It is not a case of the NHS being mean, it is simply that it is not a good test. For people who haven't had a stroke, the risk of stroke or death during the operation is about 3%.</p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_aneurysm\" title=\"\">Aortic aneurysm</a> screening is another \"quick and easy\" test Life Line Screening offers. The scan is relatively straightforward to do \u2013 an ultrasound probe run up and down the abdomen \u2013 but the results can create dilemmas and uncertainties. The idea is that by screening, and operating pre-emptively on aneurysmic swellings, sudden deaths by rupture of the aneurysm can be avoided.</p> <p>The problem is that the surgery is relatively risky - because most people with aneurysms also have vascular disease elsewhere, which can mean a higher anaesthetic risk. So this has to be balanced against the ability of the surgery to avoid some sudden ruptures, which have a high death rate.</p> <p>How is that best done? I don't think it's by alarming and scaring people into having the test. The UK National Screening Committee has examined the evidence and decided that screening is beneficial overall for 65-year-old men. Women aren't offered it because it <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD002945.pub2\" title=\"\">doesn't reduce their overall death rate</a>.</p> <p>Screening <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002945.pub2/abstract\" title=\"\">could cut the 6,000 deaths a year from ruptured aortic aneurysms in England and Wales by about half</a>. However, the mortality rate in the 30 days after the planned operation to repair an aortic aneurysm is <a href=\"http://www.ejves.com/article/S1078-5884(04)00244-8/abstract\" title=\"\">around 5%</a>.</p> <p>Furthermore, a large randomised controlled trial in which more than 10,000 men were screened showed that overall mortality from aortic aneurysm screening was reduced, <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/338/bmj.b2307?view=long&amp;pmid=19553269\" title=\"\">but only by a tiny amount</a> \u2014 from 30.93% in the control group to 30.32% in the screened group. Men need this kind of balanced information to make an informed choice \u2014 not hype and scaremongering.</p> <p>So how can we ensure that people are given such fair choice? Many doctors, myself included, have repeatedly raised concerns about private screening adverts with the Advertising Standards Authority. As the result of a complaint to the ASA by me and others in 2011, Life Line Screening has now stopped saying its tests could offer \"peace of mind\" and \"prevent\" stroke \u2014 which were patently never the case \u2014 but that's about it. Because the company agreed to make changes to its adverts, the <a href=\"http://www.margaretmccartney.com/blog/?p=1446\" title=\"\">ASA did not make a formal adjudication</a>, but I believe that its screening tests are still oversold and under-explained.</p> <p>I and some collegeagues complained to the General Medical Council about the medical director of Life Line Screening, Dr John Coltart, saying that the company offered for-profit tests without providing fair information and an evidence base. We were told that no investigation would take place unless we could prove a patient had been harmed.</p> <p>This is what is called the \"screening paradox\" \u2014 when people have false alarms caused by screening, many tend to feel that they're \"better safe than sorry\" rather than angry at unnecessary and inappropriate testing and bad screening science.</p> <p>So out of frustration and anger, myself and a few colleagues \u2014 including GPs and neurologists \u2014 have set up a website, <a href=\"http://privatehealthscreen.org/\" title=\"\">www.privatehealthscreening.org</a> to share information about screening and suggest things that people who are considering private tests might want to think about first. One of our collaborators is emeritus professor of neurology Charles Warlow, who went for a Life Line Screening in his local church call and concluded, in the BMJ, \"<a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/338/bmj.b1940\" title=\"\">Why is this nonsense tolerated or allowed?</a>\"</p> <p>It's a good question and one that UK regulators seem not to be asking.</p> <p><em>Margaret McCartney is a GP, writer and broadcaster, and author of </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9781780660004/the-patient-paradox-why-sexed-up-medicine-is-bad-for-your-health\" title=\"\"><em>The Patient Paradox: Why Sexed Up Medicine is Bad for your Health</em></a><em> (Pinter and Martin)</em></p>",

It also cast serious doubt on the evidence of Cole and the \"materially defective\" recollections of the Chelsea secretary, David Barnard. The ruling suggested that Cole's evidence \"evolved\" over time to suit the case that Ferdinand may have said the phrase in question on the pitch.</p> <p>The Chelsea left-back, who is due to win his 100th England cap a week on Tuesday against Poland, said via Twitter after seeing news of the verdict on television: \"Hahahahaa, well done #fa I lied did I, #BUNCHOFTWATS.\" He apologised two hours later via his solicitor, claiming the remarks were made \"in the heat of the moment\". The tweet was sent just as Roberto Di Matteo was giving a press conference and the Chelsea manager was forced to insist his players were not \"out of control\".</p> <p>It is understood that the England manager, Roy Hodgson, called Cole and the FA later confirmed he would join up with the squad as planned on Monday.</p> <p>Terry was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/jul/13/john-terry-cleared-anton-ferdinand\" title=\"\">cleared by a court in July</a> of a racially aggravated public order offence, although the magistrate cast doubt on his version of events. He was then <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/27/john-terry-verdict-chelsea-guilty\" title=\"\">found guilty of misconduct by the FA</a> last month and handed a four-match ban and a \u00a3220,000 fine. Whereas the criminal case had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, the FA commission made its judgment on the balance of probabilities. Terry has until 18 October to decide whether to appeal and Chelsea refused to comment further while that possibility remained active.</p> <p>\"The commission is quite satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that there is no credible basis for Terry's defence [in using the phrase],\" the ruling said.</p> <p>The three-strong FA commission heard evidence from Ferdinand but not from Terry or Cole, who declined to appear. It was forced to rely on their evidence at Westminster magistrates court.</p> <p>The verdict also reiterated that it was not the panel's job to rule on whether Terry was a racist or not: \"In common with the Crown's proceedings, the FA's case is that Mr Terry said the words by way of an insult to Mr Ferdinand. It is not the FA's case that Mr Terry is a racist.\"</p> <p>The saga, which along with last season's incident involving Luis Su\u00e1rez and Patrice Evra sparked fevered debate about the prevalence of racism in the game, began during an ill-tempered televised match between QPR and Chelsea on 23 October last year. The FA argued it could not hear the case until after the criminal proceedings, which ended with Terry's acquittal in July.</p> <p>According to \"cogent\" new evidence considered by the panel but not by the court, in an interview with FA officials at Chelsea's training ground five days after the match, Cole said he heard a \"b-word\" but did not mention the word black. In a later emailed statement, Cole said the word \"could have been Bridge\". But Barnard later emailed the FA after discussing the matter with Cole to add the words \"black or Bridge\".</p> <p>In his witness statement some 10 months later Barnard also claims that Cole heard the word \"cunt\" being used in close proximity to the \"b-word\". But the commission found on the balance of probabilities that Cole's original evidence contained neither that word nor \"fucking\" \u2013 the \"unholy trinity\" of words that Terry claimed had provoked his outburst.</p> <p>\"All of this causes the commission to have very real concerns about the accuracy of Mr Barnard's recollection, and the motivation for the assertions that he makes in his witness statement about what Mr Cole said during the FA interview.\" The commission said those concerns raised \"significant doubts\" about the case that Barnard advances.</p> <p>In deciding the punishment, the commission took into account Ferdinand's victim impact statement that made plain he had been \"badly affected\" by the incident, and the high-profile nature of the match. Weighed against that was the fact the insult was said only once and testimonials in favour of Terry from team-mates and others in the game.</p> <p>Kick It Out, the campaign group that has done much to help rid football grounds of racism over the past two decades, said the episode had threatened to undo that good work. A spokesman said: \"It's a period that has polarised the game, undermined the good work being done at all levels, and it must never be allowed to happen again.\"</p> <p>Chelsea are likely to take disciplinary action against Cole over the language in his tweet but stated that \"Ashley co-operated at all times with the FA and stands by the evidence that he gave and does not accept the criticism that has been made\".</p> <p>The commission said that the \"highly material issues\" raised by Barnard's email and Cole's evidence were not considered by the magistrate in the criminal case, although it is understood they were supplied to the Crown Prosecution Service by the FA.</p> <p>\"Had it been before him, the commission has no doubt that the chief magistrate would have examined Mr Cole's evidence as to what he claims he heard Mr Ferdinand say to Mr Terry on the pitch very carefully indeed, or scrutinised it even more closely than he may have done,\" it said.</p>",
  "<p>The actor Daryl Hannah was arrested in northeast Texas on Thursday, along with a landowner as the pair protested against an oil pipeline designed to bring crude from Canada to the Gulf Coast.</p> <p>\"They've arrested Daryl Hannah and a rural Texas great-grandmother,\" said Paul Bassis, Hannah's attorney.</p> <p>Hannah and Eleanor Fairchild were standing in front of heavy equipment in an attempt to halt construction of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jan/18/obama-administration-rejects-keystone-xl-pipeline\" title=\"\">Keystone XL pipeline</a> on Fairchild's farm in Winnsboro, a town about 100 miles east of Dallas. They were arrested for criminal trespassing and taken to the Wood County Jail, Bassis said.</p> <p>Hannah has long opposed TransCanada's construction of the $7bn pipeline, which is designed to transport heavy tar-sands crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to Texas' Gulf Coast refineries.</p> <p>\"It is unfortunate Ms Hannah and other out-of-state activists have chosen to break the law by illegally trespassing on private property,\" David Dodson, a spokesman for TransCanada, said in a statement.

They also say refining the oil would further contaminate the air in a region that has long struggled with pollution.</p> <p>TransCanada says its pipeline would be the safest ever built, and that the crude is no dirtier than oil currently arriving from Venezuela or parts of California.</p> <p>The issue became politically charged when congressional Republicans gave President Barack Obama 60 days to decide whether TransCanada should be granted the necessary permit for the pipeline to cross an international border before snaking its way 1,700 miles south to the Texas coast.</p> <p>Obama, saying his administration did not have enough time to study the potential environmental impacts, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jan/18/obama-administration-rejects-keystone-xl-pipeline\" title=\"\">denied the permit in January</a>.</p> <p>However, he encouraged TransCanada to reroute the northern portion of the pipeline to avoid an environmentally sensitive area of Nebraska. He also promised to expedite permitting of a southern portion of the pipeline from Cushing, Oklahoma, to the Gulf Coast to relieve a bottleneck at the Cushing refinery.</p> <p>TransCanada began construction of that portion of the pipeline this summer after receiving the necessary permits. Some Texas landowners, joined by activists from outside the state, have tried through various protests to stop or slow down construction.</p>",
  "<p>Say what you like about Ed Miliband, but the guy's got chutzpah. His claim that Labour is now the country's \"one nation party\" was hardly original: Tony Blair said exactly the same thing <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/blair-says-labour-the-one-nation-party-1573263.html\" title=\"\">back in February 1995</a>. Still, it has caught the imagination of the media and may even cut through to the electorate. If it does, however, the Tories only have themselves to blame. Miliband, like Blair before him, is simply exploiting a gaping hole left at the heart of the Conservative party by the <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/juncture/171/9726/whither-the-tory-left\" title=\"\">virtual disappearance of the Tory left</a>.</p> <p>In an essay for the Institute for Public Policy Research journal <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/juncture/166\" title=\"\">Juncture</a>, I argue that the so-called progressive, \"one-nation\", Tories constituted the parliamentary party's centre of gravity from the 50s through to the mid-70s. For these Tories, mass unemployment was not only economically irrational but morally indefensible. The welfare state and mixed economy was a necessary, even welcome corrective to market failure and trade unionism a power that needed channelling rather than crushing.</p> <p>Socially, a degree of multiculturalism was an inevitable legacy of Britain's imperial past that may as well be embraced rather than railed against. Prison worked, but law and order had to be about prevention and rehabilitation, too. Comprehensive schooling and mass higher education (though rarely good enough for their own children) was more likely than a divisively selective and elitist system to help the UK compete in a rapidly Europeanising economy.</p> <p>It was these views \u2013 maintained partly out of conviction, partly out of calculation \u2013 that prompted many of the U-turns that helped ensure that the initially rather rightwing Heath administration ended up as the government most Tories love to hate. Yet progressives might have retained control of the party after the election defeats of 1974 had they handled its aftermath more adroitly. By not insisting their beleaguered leader step down in favour of a trusted successor, however, they allowed Margaret Thatcher \u2013 a woman they badly underestimated \u2013 to mount what turned out to be one of the most effective insurgencies in British political history. Before they knew it, she was handing over the key policy portfolios to fellow rightwingers and beginning to shunt those she saw as irredeemable patricians into the sidings.</p> <p>After 1979, a combination of Thatcher's stunning electoral success and generational replacement within the parliamentary party \u2013 plus the increasingly poisonous politics of Europe \u2013 meant that even those leftwingers whose talent made them individually indispensable (Ken Clarke being the paradigmatic example) quickly found themselves fewer and farther between. As a result, while the Tories may have dumped Thatcher in 1990, they have never managed to dump Thatcherism.</p> <p>There were some who believed that David Cameron would finally help them do so. But as leader of the opposition, Cameron never really had any of the big arguments with his party that anyone driving genuine change needs to have \u2013 not so much because he was scared to, but because, once one scratched away their social liberalism and their affected concern for the environment and public services, he and those around him were no less Thatcherite than the rest.</p> <p>Because there was no transformation towards post-Thatcherism, let alone pre-Thatcherism, Cameron as prime minister now finds himself faced with a party in parliament and a party in the media which borders on the delusional \u2013 unable to accept that simply swallowing more and more of the medicine once prescribed by their heroine might not do the job this time around. More pressingly, the gap between the Tories and the Lib Dems is proving much bigger than creative thinkers on the Conservative side, such as <a href=\"http://www.nickbolesmp.com/\" title=\"\">Nick Boles</a>, hoped that it might be \u2013 precisely because the number of his Conservative colleagues ideologically willing and able to reach across it proved vanishingly small.</p> <p>The most important gap, however, is the one that the shock-troops of \"one-nation Labour\" (presuming for the moment they are more than a phantom army) look set to pour into, namely the gap between what a 21st century electorate want from a Tory government \u2013 a blend of competence and compassion, willing to take on vested interests in the private as well as the public sector in order to show that we really are \"all in this together\" \u2013 and what they are currently getting.</p> <p>The problem for the Tories is that there are so few of them who understand this. Because the party's left failed to recover from the extinction-level event that hit it in 1975, there is no way the pendulum can swing back.</p> <p>Back before Disraeli, another Tory icon Edmund Burke reminded reactionaries that \"a state without the means of some change is without the means of its conservation\". The same goes for a political party. Without a genuine balance of forces that ensures the presence of people prepared to challenge the prevailing wisdom, a damaging groupthink can develop, blinkering the majority that buys into it into believing that there is no alternative.</p> <p>Occasionally, of course, they are right. But if they are wrong, the results can be disastrous.</p>",
  "<p>Anyone hoping for a coherent local government plan to emerge from Labour's conference will have been disappointed but shadow ministers did flag up major new council powers over health and transport.</p> <p>The conference was dominated by economic issues and Ed Miliband's second coming, but there was little space for a philosophical debate on the nature of an over-centralised state. Local government's low profile in discussions on how to revive growth was a worrying sign that it is in the margins of Labour thinking.</p> <p>The biggest, if sketchy, local government news to emerge from Labour's party conference this week came from shadow health secretary Andy Burnham. He said he was beginning to examine the option of \"full integration\" of health and social care, sees hospitals having a major responsibility for social services, and wants local councils to replace clinical commissioning groups as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/02/andy-burnham-labour-coalition-nhs last line of defence\" title=\"\">lead commissioners of healthcare</a>.</p> <p>While local government has a great deal of commissioning experience, the wisdom of playing pass-the-parcel with health commissioning again is highly debatable. What the NHS does not need is yet more structural upheaval, and local government will still be getting to grips with public health in the next parliament. Burnham would need to make a convincing case that further chaos would help patients.</p> <p>As for integrating health and social care, Labour would be doing everyone a service if they proposed solutions to the financial and cultural barriers. At present, social care investment can often save NHS money, but the inherent problem with this is not easy to fix.</p> <p>Burnham had another role for local government, he said: Labour councils would be the \"<a href=\"http://www.lgcplus.com/briefings/joint-working/health/burnham-one-budget-for-  health-and-care/5050171.article\" title=\"\">last line of defence</a>\" for the NHS and would \"defend it on the ground in every community in England\". This had a sub-Churchillian ring to it; \"We will fight them in the hospital car parks and in the waiting rooms \u2026\"</p> <p>City regions again demonstrated their influence and potential in the debate on transport policy. Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle <a href=\"http://www.regen.net/news/1153130/\" title=\"\">told a fringe meeting</a> she wants more councils in city regions to form integrated transport authorities, adding to the six already in place, with control over road and rail services and major infrastructure projects.</p> <p>Alongside the government's city deals and plans already in train to give the integrated transport authorities more control over major projects, it demonstrates how cities are the driving force for devolving power.</p> <p>The challenge for local government is to recast this \"cities first\" formula to make it relevant for districts and counties. Notwithstanding the potential of a modest boost to districts through business rate retention, there is a risk of a two-speed local government developing, which will hamper the ability of shire areas to revive their economies.</p> <p>But how will Labour's policy ideas fit together? The speech by shadow communities secretary Hilary Benn in the dying hours of the party's five-day marathon contained not one syllable on what a future Labour administration would do on local government.</p> <p>There was the traditional mea culpa of those recently ejected from office about the error of being too wedded to Whitehall, but nothing about what Labour would or should do to avoid the same mistake next time around.</p> <p>Nor was there any deconstruction of Eric Pickles' brand of localism. For all its faults, at least Pickles has a strategy. Labour seems to have surrendered that ground and left the Conservatives to define the debate (the LibDems are strangely silent on what is their traditional political heartland).</p> <p>Labour must not neglect the importance of developing a coherent narrative on local government while in opposition. It should be central to its strategies for rebuilding the economy and tackling issues such the shortages of skills and homes. That means integrating it into their thinking across the whole spectrum of policies, not have ideas surface as a series of cottage industries.</p> <p>There was plenty of praise from the platform for the party's councils \u2013 shadow chancellor Ed Balls rightly applauded host city Manchester for paving the way for the Olympics with its exemplary staging of the Commonwealth Games a decade ago.

  "<p>Making lists of favorite things is, for me, a task ridden with anxiety. What if I've accidentally excluded something I love? What if I discover something new tomorrow that I love even more? And for this list, how I do define \"family drama\"? What is a family, anyway? </p> <p>That last question is one I ask myself often, and explore directly or indirectly in all of my novels. It might be the central question of How to Save a Life, as the three women in the story come together to make something new, something real, of the broken pieces of their lives. </p> <p>I'm sure I'm drawn to these types of stories because of my own background of finding family and home in unexpected places. </p> <p>Some of the titles on my list have to do with biological family, and some are about chosen family. Many are both. In no particular order:</p> <h2>1. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780571230082\">Housekeeping</a> by Marilynne Robinson</h2> <p>Ruth and Lucille are sisters who grow up without their mother, and are instead cared for by their grandmother and various other female relatives. We see them age from childhood to adulthood, change, suffer, and survive against the backdrop of their small town on a glacial lake. Robinson approaches these people and their strange, fragile lives with tenderness and extraordinarily beautiful writing.</p> <h2>2. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780099479413\">Ladder of Years</a> by Anne Tyler</h2> <p>Truly, I could put any book by Tyler on this list. She has made a decades-long career out of bringing families to the page in ways poignant, funny, and recognizable. I think of this story in particular because it follows one woman who thinks she doesn't want her family anymore or the responsibilities that come with it. She leaves, only to find herself almost immediately taking a mother-like responsibility for the strangers she encounters in her new life.</p> <h2>3. One Crazy Summer by Rita Williams-Garcia</h2> <p>Every time I tell someone about this book, I start to cry. Delphine, eleven, and her two younger sisters Vonetta and Fern travel across the country to spend the summer with their mom, who they hardly know (and who happens to be a figure in the Black Power movement of the late sixties). Watching these girls try to figure out who their mother is and why she left them breaks my heart in the best way.</p> <h2>4. All Together Now by Sue Ellen Bridgers</h2> <p>This is another story of a young girl sent away to stay with family that she doesn't really know. I first encountered it when I was ten or eleven, and the people who inhabit the world of the book made such an impression on me that I've re-read it every couple of years since. It's not well-known, and if there's one underappreciated book in my life that I could magically add to the literary canon, this would be it.</p> <h2>5. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780141182827\">The Member of the Wedding</a> by Carson McCullers</h2> <p>\"Frankie had become an unjoined person who hung around in doorways, and she was afraid.\" That's McCullers' introduction to the character of Frankie, who is restless and lonely and motherless, and dreaming of fixing her unjoined state via her older brother's upcoming wedding. She imagines herself as the third character in their marriage. As you may imagine, this doesn't go well. A wrenching book by an American master.</p> <h2>6. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780141032009\">The Diary of a Young Girl</a> by Anne Frank</h2> <p>Obviously, this isn't a novel, and it's so much more than a family drama. But it is definitely that, too. There is biological family, and there is chosen family, and then there is the family that's thrust upon you by tragedy or other circumstance. Anne's diary is full of her conflicted feelings about her parents and sister and the other people in the attic who she's been forced to share her life with. It's those conflicts that connected me to the bigger story about history and humanity when I read this as a teen.</p> <h2>7. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/search.do\">Little House in the Big Woods (and all its sequels)</a> by Laura Ingalls Wilder</h2> <p>Ma, Pa, Mary and Laura and the rest of the Ingalls clan were as real to me in my childhood as my own family. This family of pioneers of the American West certainly encountered their share of epic drama (wolves! fires! drought!), but I think it was the way these things were woven through with the joys and trials and tasks of everyday life that captured me as a young reader.</p> <h2>8. Borrowed Names: Poems About Laura Ingalls Wilder, Madam C.J. Walker, Marie Curie, and Their Daughters by Jeannine Atkins</h2> <p>Speaking of Laura Ingalls Wilder, I love this collection of poems about her and two other prominent women in history who were born in 1867. Each of them had daughters at the start of the 1900s when culture - and especially women's place in culture - was going through rapid change. These are poems in the imagined voices of the daughters. It's unusual and moving and thought-provoking.</p> <h2>9. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780316125277\">In Zanesville</a> by Jo Ann Beard</h2> <p>A more recent discovery, this story of 1970s girlhood (which happens to be my own growing-up milieu) made me laugh and also marvel. Beard's ability to recall the everyday details of what it looked and felt like to be a kid during that decade is boggling. The narrator's family exists almost as a backdrop, but also somehow as the most important thing in her life. I just decided I need to re-read this immediately.</p> <h2>10. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780140623567\">Little Women</a> by Louisa May Alcott</h2> <p>I'll finish off with the March sisters and their lives in pre-Civil War America. There's something timeless about her portrayal of the relationships between and among sisters - the daily roller-coaster of love and hate and just barely tolerating. And there is plenty of drama to go around, in and out of the household. I'm equally fond of Little Men and Jo's Boys as the March family saga continues.</p> <h2>Join the book club</h2> <p>\u2022 Competition: we're teaming up with Usborne to offer you the chance to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/05/teen-book-club-win-a-kindle\">win a kindle pre-loaded with a bunch of fantastic YA books</a><br>\u2022 Get your hands on a copy: our giveaway might be closed but there's still <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/05/teen-book-club-sara-zarr-pick-up-your-copy\">plenty of ways to get hold of the book</a><br>\u2022 And in case you missed it, why not <a href=\"http://seeinside.usborne.com/default.asp?id=6386&amp;site=4\">check out the first chapter of How to Save a Life</a> and see what all the fuss is about!</p> <p><strong>As always, let us know what you think on our <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/guardianteenbooks\">Facebook page</a> or on Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/GuardianTeenBks\">@Guardianteenbks</a></strong></p>",
  "<p>Amid thunder and driving rain, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez stormed to the conclusion of his toughest presidential race yet on Thursday with a passionate address to hundreds of thousands of supporters in Caracas.</p> <p>The mass rally transformed the city centre into a sea of cheering, dancing, red-shirted followers on the final day of campaigning before Sunday's vote, which looks likely to be the closest since the former tank commander won power in 1998.</p> <p>The turn-out was bigger than the huge opposition rally staged last Sunday by his rival Henrique Capriles, who has narrowed the gap between the two candidates but is still significantly behind in most polls.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez is the strong favourite, but few are predicting a landslide victory on the scale of past wins. Having battled cancer for most of the past year, he has been less visible than during previous campaigns.</p> <p>With many in the electorate frustrated at high murder rates and declining infrastructure, the opposition believe this is their best chance to grab power.</p> <p>But the president has repeatedly disproved his critics. Although some predicted his illness was so bad that he would not survive until election day, he has picked up the pace in the past week and looked robust on Thursday as he spoke, danced and sang on stage despite the torrential downpour.</p> <p>\"We are playing for life. In our hands we will not lose the fatherland, we will not lose the future of the fatherland,\" he proclaimed to a fervent crowd. He led a chorus of the national anthem, played air guitar to a campaign soundtrack and led his family on stage to huge applause.</p> <p>But as well as triumphalism and defiance, Ch\u00e1vez has added an unusual degree of contrition in recent speeches, where he has tended to refer to himself in the third person: \"I have made many mistakes, but I am here with all my soul. Ch\u00e1vez is not me. Ch\u00e1vez is the people,\" he said at a rally on Sunday. \"Ch\u00e1vez will not fail you the next term \u2026 during the next term he will be a better president, more efficient, a better companion.\"</p> <p>If he wins another term, aides say the president is preparing to do more to address security and economic concerns in recognition of the shortcomings that have eroded his popularity. But his core of support remains vast.</p> <p>The crowds had been gathering in Bol\u00edvar Avenue and other major thoroughfares since the morning. Some had travelled hundreds of miles on overnight buses. Others had come by subway, motorbike or foot from the Caracas barrios to show their support for a politician whom they credit for doing more for the poor than any other leader in the country's history.</p> <p>\"I'm here to show support for Ch\u00e1vez because I've seen how the country has been transformed in the past 14 years,\" said Ligia Escalona, a law student from Lara state, who had left at 1am to make the long journey to Caracas. \"Thanks to the education programs, people who have not previously had access to schooling are now literate and have an opportunity to go to college.\"</p> <p>Many wore red and blue shirts emblazoned with the president's eyes or slogans declaring \"Ch\u00e1vez, heart of the fatherland\". Some wore hats bearing the portraits of the heroes of Latin America's left: Ch\u00e1vez, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, Rafael Correa and Evo Morales. Others carried banners reading \"On the way to victory on 7 October.\"</p> <p>The streets were filled with noise as well as colour: vuvuzelas, whistles, drums, loudspeakers playing salsa mixed with political lyrics, and chants of \"Oh, aah, Ch\u00e1vez no se va\" (Ch\u00e1vez won't go) \u2013 a slogan first heard after a failed 2002 coup against the president.</p> <p>Junior Landaetta, a police student, had come with a samba band to add to the fiesta spirit. Aged 18, he is part of a new generation who will vote for the first time on Sunday \u2013 a key segment of the electorate in a country that has undergone rapid population growth in recent years.</p> <p>\"I'll vote for Ch\u00e1vez until death,\" he said as his band passed by the Congress building. \"He has done so much for the country. If Capriles wins, I think everything will fall to pieces.\"</p> <p>Polls, analysts and the electorate are sharply divided about the likely outcome, but there is widespread agreement that Ch\u00e1vez has lost some of his previously enormous support.</p> <p>\"The serious polls show Ch\u00e1vez will win by about 14%. But I can see that Capriles has done a good campaign and that the gap has been closing in the last few days. It might now be between 7 and 10 points,\" said Nicmer Evans, a left-leaning political scientist at the Central University of Venezuela. \"The main reasons why Ch\u00e1vez's popularity has waned is flaws in management. Although he has been very successful in creating political consciousness, Ch\u00e1vez accepts criticism about the quality of the revolution.\"</p> <p>\"I think it will be close and that Capriles will win,\" said Teodoro Petkoff, a former Marxist guerilla, founder of the Socialist party and former presidential election challenger. \"If the gap is just 1 or 2 points for either contender, it could unleash violence.\"</p> <p>Close aides of the president dismiss rumours of possible unrest, saying the president will accept the result, whatever the outcome.</p> <p>But his supporters on the streets said they would defend the gains they have won under Ch\u00e1vez. \"Capriles is a wolf in sheep's clothing. He would dismantle everything we've built,\" said Henry Reveron, a former peasant who has been able to train as a lawyer under one of Ch\u00e1vez's social \"misions\".</p> <p>\"If Ch\u00e1vez loses, we'll go into unwavering opposition. This is a peaceful revolution, but if needed we'll go into the mountains and fight with our nails, teeth, arms and whatever is necessary. Venezuela is no longer naive.\"</p>",
  "<p>On Monday morning, as the first full day of the Labour party conference got underway, Harriet Harman tweeted: \"Labour will be the party for housing\". A few hours later, shadow chancellor Ed Balls took to the stage in Manchester to announce that he would use a one off \u00a33bn windfall from the sale of the 4G mobile phone spectrum to develop 100,000 \"affordable\" homes \u2013 a plan calculated with the help of the National Housing Federation.</p> <p>The announcement itself is political genius: a promise for now by a party in opposition and unable to act on it. The policy makes a statement about Labour's intentions but commits its members to absolutely nothing should they be re-elected in 2015. Rather, it's a short-term answer to the much bigger question of solving desperate housing need.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Ed Balls' declaration of intent is a welcome signal for the housing sector. There were more fringe sessions covering housing than any other policy during the conference, and shadow housing minister Jack Dromey admitted to having appeared at more than 30 himself.</p> <p>These sessions also made the essential link between housing and other social determinants, such as health, education and unemployment \u2013 nuances well understood by housing and social care professionals but too often overlooked in political debate. If Labour really is to become the party for housing, its own policies must reflect this understanding.</p> <p>Dromey made only one solid commitment during the conference: if he was appointed housing minister, he would regulate letting agents. It may not be action enough to pacify the agitators in his own party. Earlier this year, Islington MP Jeremy Corbyn called for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2012/mar/15/private-housing-rent-regulation-jeremy-corbyn?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">rent regulation in the private sector</a> to put an end to rising rents in unmanaged and often unfit tenures.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian housing network, Dromey himself <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/video/2012/jun/11/jack-dromey-labour-shadow-housing-minister-video?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">promised action to control the private rented sector</a>, admitting that it had an important part to play in meeting housing need \"but not on its current terms\". \"We're looking at a very different model for the future \u2013 longer term tenancies, tackling the issue of ever-increasing rents, proper regulation of the private rented sector,\" he said.</p> <p>Of course, it's a long time until the parties open their formal election campaigns, but already Dromey's message appears watered down from his own firm commitments for change. As Balls takes Labour's big housing announcement of the conference season from him, how far is he really leading on the brief?</p> <p>In the meantime, Dromey will preside over a <a href=\"http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/regulation/labour-party-to-launch-housing-network/6524011.article\" title=\"\">group of Labour councils</a> selected to share best practice in meeting today's housing need, from new development to using housing revenue account in innovative ways. Membership of this group, expected to number about 20 is yet to be formally announced, but using local expertise to develop national policy would be no bad thing for a party looking to stake its success on the fortunes of the housing sector.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for more comment, analysis and best practice direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>Ed Miliband has condemned a Labour delegate for heckling a schoolgirl during a speech to the party's conference about her academy school.</p> <p>The year 11 pupil was explaining how her school encouraged the arts when <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/update/2012-10-04/teenage-girl-heckled-at-labour-party-conference/\" title=\"\">one delegate shouted: \"A lot of comprehensives do the same\".</a> Academy schools are controversial because they are freed from local authority control.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ed_Miliband/status/253947286885908480\" title=\"\">The Labour leader later tweeted</a>: \"The person who shouted during the speech by a year 11 pupil was totally wrong and doesn't speak for Labour. The hundreds who applauded her do.\"</p> <p>Joan al-Assam, who is due to sit GCSEs this summer, is a pupil at <a href=\"http://www.paddington-academy.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Paddington Academy</a> in west London, a school created under the last Labour government. She came to Britain from Iraq as an asylum seeker at the age of six.</p> <p>In her speech, Joan, who hopes to study law at university, spoke about arriving in the UK \"with only the clothes on my back. I was powerless, helpless and most of all I was lost. But in Britain we can change out future&#xa0;\u2026 mould it into whatever shape we desire. To me, education has a simple meaning: it's simply a key \u2013 a key that will open a bright future.\"</p> <p>The education secretary, Michael Gove, said: \"Heckling a schoolgirl because she goes to an academy is disgraceful. But it also shows the real face of Labour \u2013 a party where aspiration and achievement gets booed.\"</p> <p>Joan was speaking at the Manchester conference before the keynote speech of the shadow education secretary, Stephen Twigg.</p> <p>Twigg said: \"It's a privilege to do this job when you get the chance to meet young people like Joan &#xa0;\u2026 despite all of the barriers she faced, she became a grade A student\".</p> <p>Gove said Labour should expel the heckler from the party.</p> <p>\"This pupil is a credit to her school and proof that we need to expand the academies programme.\"</p> <p>On Thursday night, Labour released a statement saying: \"Nobody should be heckled, especially not a 16-year-old girl. We should debate education in a civilised and polite fashion at conference.\"</p> <p>A Labour spokesman said no further details about the girl were being released by the party, at the request of her family.</p>",
  "<p>Britain will be \"taken to the cleaners\" if the coalition gives in to French and German demands about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2012/oct/04/bae-eads-merger-change-of-control\" title=\"\">the merger between BAE Systems and EADS</a>, says Alistair Darling.</p> <p>The former chancellor said it was \"totally unacceptable\" that France and Germany were demanding equity stakes in the new company, while British taxpayers will not hold any shareholding in a business that will combine the UK's largest defence contractor with the owner of Airbus.</p> <p>\"We will be taken to the cleaners,\" Darling <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/33c84138-0e3e-11e2-8b92-00144feabdc0.html#axzz28JGMDayN\" title=\"\">told the Financial Times (subscription)</a>. \"I don't see how you could have a large new company like this with the French and German governments having large direct and indirect stakes and we have none.\"</p> <p>Darling said he would prefer it if all three governments held minimal stakes. \"There is a danger that decisions in the defence and commercial businesses could be taken on the basis of politics rather than what is best,\" he said.</p> <p>It is understood Downing Street is being the least intractable government player in the negotiations between the companies and the crucial state triumvirate of the UK, France and Germany. That indicates it is broadly happy with the outlines of a deal that will see EADS control 60% of the dual-listed business and BAE investors will hold 40%.</p> <p>BAE and EADS have both suggested governments should not be able to hold large stakes in the combined company which, with a market value of \u00a329bn, would be the world's largest arms, defence and aerosopace company.</p> <p>Tom Enders, the chief executive of EADS who has long battled against political interference, has said: \"We want to create a company that is even more successful internationally and attracts investors.

  "<h2><strong>A change of tack from Nigel Adkins</strong></h2> <p>\"Never do what your instincts tell you. Always, always do the opposite.\" It took George Costanza 86 episodes of Seinfeld to follow his own advice, but once he did the success started to roll in. Southampton's manager, Nigel Adkins, should take note. With one win and four defeats in six games, not to mention 18 goals conceded \u2013 only one other team in the history of the Premier League have let in that many goals after just six games, Newcastle in 1999-2000 \u2013 something needs to change at St Mary's. After <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/30/everton-southampton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">last weekend's defeat by Everton</a>, Adkins vowed to ignore Costanza's advice and stick by his side's attacking instincts \u2013 \"we believe we play football the right way\". While those instincts brought a win over Aston Villa, they have delivered precious little else. If Adkins were to adopt a more defensive shape than his tried, trusted and failing 4-1-4-1 formation, Southampton fans may find themselves enjoying Premier League football for longer than it looks right now. <strong>IMC</strong></p> <h2><strong>Koscielny out, Mertesacker in</strong></h2> <p>Laurent Koscielny's rather inept display <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/30/arsenal-chelsea-premier-league\" title=\"\">against Chelsea last week</a> did contain at least one positive note for Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, as it solved any selection headache he might have had over who to play alongside Thomas Vermaelen in Saturday's game at Upton Park. If Koscielny can be pushed around by Fernando Torres, hardly the most physical of strikers, then he has little chance against either Carlton Cole or, more likely, Andy Carroll. And so Per Mertesacker should regain his place. But Arsenal close the door on one selection problem only to open another. With Abou Diaby out injured, <em>again</em>, there is a space in the middle that could be filled either by Aaron Ramsey or Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. The latter is still learning, the former is still regressing. And then there is the question of Gervinho. The Ivory Coast international often looks like an embarrassed teenager on an early sexual encounter; he's scoring, yet most of his time is spent fumbling around without really knowing what to do. But who could come in ahead of him? Olivier Giroud, who has been poor so far? Or the ever inconsistent Theo Walcott? Either way, there is plenty for Wenger to ponder. <strong>IMC</strong></p> <h2><strong>QPR playing a sweet passing game</strong></h2> <p>Ezra Pound described his incomplete poem, Cantos, as a \"rag-bag\", but he could just as well have been talking about Queens Park Rangers' style of play. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/01/premier-league-qpr-west-ham\" title=\"\">Against West Ham on Monday</a> Esteban Granero and Alejandro Faurl\u00edn, as well as Adel Taarabt when he came on, looked to get the ball down and play a short, crisp, penetrative passing game. But far too often their good work was undone by a team-mate more interested in aiming for a fan in a white and blue hooped shirt than a fellow player. Hughes also had Bobby Zamora dropping deep to collect the ball, which left Djibril Ciss\u00e9 isolated as a lone target man; Ciss\u00e9 is many things to many people but a lone target man he is certainly not. If Hughes wants to back up his promise that QPR will not find themselves mired in the same relegation battle as last season, then he will need to define a style for his side and ensure his surfeit of players operate more as a team than the expensive rabble they currently resemble. <strong>IMC</strong></p> <h2><strong>Darren Bent starting against Tottenham</strong></h2> <p>It is a local derby, your season is going so-so and your 'goals for' column in the table is one of the lowest in the league, so what you do? Drop your best striker for an inconsistent one who is just returning from injury? Or, better yet, drop him for another striker who is in his first Premier League season and has yet to prove himself? Of course you don't, unless you're Paul Lambert. The Aston Villa manager took a big gamble leaving Darren Bent to ride the bench <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/30/darren-bent-aston-villa-west-brom\" title=\"\">last weekend against West Bromwich Albion</a>. Luckily for the Scot, it paid off within three touches when Bent came on, but Lambert would be foolish to try the same stunt again. Bent is the sort of striker who needs an arm around the shoulder, not the Sandra-would-have-done-better approach. Players returning to old clubs tend to play with a point to prove, and if Villa want to leave White Hart Lane with anything but their tail between the legs, Bent should be an automatic choice. <strong>IMC</strong></p> <h2><strong>Peter Crouch scoring at Anfield</strong></h2> <p>Injuries, a new system, too many individual errors, an unsettled backline, and a loss of form have contributed to Liverpool's defence looking shakier than a night in a club with Mystikal. Only three teams have conceded more goals this season, and not one performance from Brendan Rodgers's side has yielded a clean sheet. With that in mind, an in-form Peter Crouch \u2013 four games, four goals \u2013 and his Stoke City cohorts would probably be the last opponents the Liverpool manager wants to welcome to Anfield this weekend. Crouch's manager, Tony Pulis, described the striker as \"unplayable\" after a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/29/stoke-city-swansea-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">brace against Swansea</a> that quite easily could have turned into his first hat-trick in the league since Liverpool's 4-1 hammering of Arsenal in March 2007. That heady mix of Crouch's form and Liverpool's weakness may just be enough to check any momentum that Rodgers's side picked up from their win over Norwich. <strong>IMC</strong></p> <h2><strong>Newcastle to expose Manchester United's shaky defence</strong></h2> <p>Back when he was plain Alex Ferguson and in charge of East Stirlingshire, it was rumoured that he used to go behind the stand and practise losing his temper. Since then he has had plenty of reason to convert that practice into performance, and Sunday's late afternoon jaunt to Newcastle is liable to provide him with another opportunity to do so \u2013 especially if his defence put in another uncertain display. They were ragged <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/30/tottenham-expose-manchester-united-frailties\" title=\"\">against Tottenham</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/02/champions-league-cluj-manchester-united-mbm\" title=\"\">ropey against Cluj</a>. They were (physically) exposed by Everton and servile against Southampton. A lack of cover in front of them is certainly not helping matters but, as Gary Neville pointed out on Monday night, the back four are not working as a unit and that is costing them goals. Last season the Magpies bullied their way to an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/jan/04/newcastle-united-manchester-united-mbm?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">impressive 3-0 win</a> in this fixture, and it would be difficult to bet against a repeat result. <strong>IMC</strong></p> <h2><strong>Swansea making more than two goalscoring chances</strong></h2> <p>When you start your season with a 5-0 away win, things are likely only to get worse (unless you get to play QPR <em>every</em> week). But Swansea's mini-slump needs to be addressed. They have lost their past three games without scoring \u2013 and it's the lack of goals rather than the defeats that alarms their manager, Michael Laudrup. \"We did not create chances like we are used to \u2013 only two or three in the whole game,\" Laudrup said after the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/30/miachael-laudrup-swansea-stoke\" title=\"\">2-0 defeat by Stoke last weekend</a>. \"It is not so much that Stoke scored. Maybe we have to look a little more into why we did not create more chances and score goals.\" Another concern is that Swansea have had a relatively easy start: Stoke and Aston Villa hadn't recorded a league victory until they came up against Laudrup's team. Saturday's game against Reading is a good opportunity for Swansea to bank some points and regain their early season fluency. There will be sterner tests ahead. <strong>TL</strong></p> <h2><strong>Continued tension between Allardyce and Wenger</strong></h2> <p>Just how does Sam Allardyce release all that anger at Real Madrid's continued, exasperating refusal to make him their manager? Well, he usually has a pop at Wenger. Here are a few choice samples:</p> <p>August 2010: \"I have to remind Ars\u00e8ne that his team, which used to win the league, was the dirtiest in the league. If you cast your mind back to when they were winning the league, they had more sendings-off and bookings than anyone else.\"</p> <p>September 2010: \"Ars\u00e8ne has most of the media in his pocket now and is almost \u2013 almost \u2013 affecting the officials so that you can't tackle an Arsenal player.\"</p> <p>April 2011: \"I don't know him well enough to like him or dislike him, but I think his own self-importance takes him into an area where he can become rude with what he does, in terms of ignoring you and ignoring what you do. For instance, he's not shaken my hand in the past and walked straight down the tunnel because he's frustrated with one thing or another.\"</p> <p>For fans of petty squabbles everywhere, let's hope Wenger does something to annoy Allardyce \u2013 perhaps forget to offer him a Polo mint on the sidelines, for instance \u2013 when Arsenal play West Ham this weekend. <strong>TL</strong></p> <h2><strong>Adam Johnson showing City what they're missing</strong></h2> <p>Much was expected of Adam Johnson when he joined Manchester City in January 2010, but injury, a falling out with Roberto Mancini and questions over his commitment meant it was no real surprise when he joined Sunderland at the start of the season. If he can realise his talent it would be a huge boost for Sunderland (and England) and there are signs that the ideal place to do that is the Stadium of Light. Martin O'Neill has a knack of getting the best out of players, Johnson's life off the pitch may be more settled in his native north-east, and in Steven Fletcher he has a brilliant target for his crosses. Johnson was solid rather than spectacular <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/30/sunderland-wigan-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">against Wigan on his return</a> from injury last weekend, but there'll be no better motivation to show he is a changed man than a meeting with City on Saturday. <strong>TL</strong></p> <h2><strong>Jelavic to maintain Everton's Goliath status</strong></h2> <p>When Everton feature in top versus bottom matches, they have usually found themselves billed as David rather than Goliath. But the Goodison Park bandwagon is gradually gathering momentum, and David Moyes's side roll into Wigan's DW Stadium in second place. Wigan have not won at home all season, which must give Everton belief that their bubble is still far from bursting \u2013 especially when they have Nikica Jelavic scoring on a regular basis. The Croatia international bagged two in Everton's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/30/everton-southampton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">3-1 win over Southampton</a> last week, and it would be prudent to back him to notch his 13th goal in 19 league games against a side who haven't kept a clean sheet in their past six games. Kevin Mirallas, Steven Pienaar and Leon Osman have been a terrifying trio this term with Marouane Fellaini and Victor Anichebe benefiting from their approach play. Roberto Mart\u00ednez will be relying on the return of Antol\u00edn Alcaraz to shore up his porous defence but, if Mirallas and co are on form, Wigan could be in for a rough ride. <strong>MS</strong></p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/nadineshah-1/aching-bones-ep-version\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to listen</a></p> <p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Whitburn</p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Nadine Shah (vocals, guitar, piano)</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> Shah is a singer-songwriter of Norwegian and Pakistani parentage from a small coastal village in the north-east of England, but she could just as easily be the result of a steamy union in the capital some time in the early-90s between <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/pjharvey\" title=\"\">Polly Harvey</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/nick-cave\" title=\"\">Nick Cave</a>. That's the lineage to which her dark tales of lust and loss, revenge and regret belong, although she also cites as influences everyone from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/philiplarkin\" title=\"\">Philip Larkin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/may/11/fridakahlo-diegorivera-bowesmuseum-durham-photographs\" title=\"\">Frida Kahlo</a> to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/interpol\" title=\"\">Interpol</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/feb/01/in-praise-of-arthur-russell\" title=\"\">Arthur Russell</a> (something in the tremulousness of her voice bears the latter out) as well as the religious Sufi songs that her father would play during car rides and the ghazals he sang in Urdu around the house. Think also Marianne Faithfull, not the prim young creature courted by Mick Jagger in the mid-60s but <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-H55V_oma0\" title=\"\">the ravaged, battle-worn survivor</a> who re-emerged with Broken English in the late 70s.</p> <p>Shah's forthcoming Aching Bones EP looks set to bring her to a wider audience following a couple of years gigging hard. It has been produced by Ben Hillier , who has worked with the Horrors, Blur and Depeche Mode.</p> <p>It's surprising that it has taken this long for her to come through. \"If all live debuts were as breathtaking as [this] then the walls of the music industry as we know it would crumble to dust, and in their place proud palaces of hope and beauty would spring forth,\" wrote one reviewer. And this was her first show, and it wasn't just some obscure blogger,<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/manchester/low/people_and_places/music/newsid_8316000/8316883.stm\" title=\"\"> it was the BBC</a>! Apparently she's been like this for years, performing Nina, Mariah and Whitney songs with searing intensity as a child, doing \"brooding menace\" when kids her age were playing with dolls. She was a bouncy, jolly girl but when she sang, as Jarvis Cocker once put it, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skdjcv9Pbwo\" title=\"\">something changed</a>.</p> <p>There is romance in her backstory, even if it's not of the troubled variety. Shah grew up on a rocky cliff overlooking the North Sea. Her mum was a sea captain's daughter, and her dad was the exotic stranger who stole her heart. Her debut album will be called Love Your Dumb and Mad, its title capturing the intriguing split in Shah's character between loving family girl and avenging banshee. The title track of the EP is typical: vengefully dark: \"She watched you wilting, she watched you cry,\" she roars over an insistent clang that provides the rhythm for the song. It's acoustic-industrial, like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/nineinchnails\" title=\"\">Nine Inch Nails</a> Unplugged, with a woman on the mic taking some delight in the discomfort of her prey. Never Tell Me Mam opens with a powerful acoustic bass note, giving way to a keyboard straight out of a 60s TV spy theme, like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/shirley-bassey\" title=\"\">Shirley Bassey</a> meets <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/shirley-manson\" title=\"\">Shirley Manson</a>. Are You With Me? makes sense of the \"female Cave\" comparisons, Shah sounding world-weary and aggrieved. Whether this woman \u2013 who owns a management company promoting other Newcastle musicians \u2013 will still sound this tired and peeved next year, when she's won all manner of plaudits and been endlessly praised, remains to be seen.</p> <p><strong>The buzz</strong>: \"<a href=\"http://onenightatthesands.wordpress.com/2010/07/01/nadine-shah-new-talent/\" title=\"\">Deeply resonating</a>\".</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> The journey from her to eternity starts here.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Kick against the pricks.</p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> Let love in.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> The Aching Bones EP is released on 19 November by Label Fandango.</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> PJ Harvey, Nick Cave, Marianne Faithfull, <a href=\"http://renharvieu.com/\" title=\"\">Ren Harvieu</a>.</p> <p><strong>Monday's new band:</strong> An Blonds.</p>",

Russia's agreement that the Syrian shelling violated international law was a key concession by Moscow after it blocked a draft that called the mortar attack \"a threat to international peace and security\".</p> <p>Earlier on Thursday, Turkey's parliament gave legal authority to the military to launch cross-border raids into Syria at any point over the next year. It was passed by 320 votes to 129.</p> <p>The Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said Turkey did not want war with Syria following the shelling on the town of Ak\u00e7akale, but was determined to protect its borders and its people. He said: \"Turkey is a country which is capable of protecting its people and borders. No one should attempt to test our determination on the issue.\"</p> <p>Erdogan suggested the Syrian shelling was not accidental, saying shells had fallen on Turkish territory on seven previous occasions since the civil war began. Ankara said it had received an apology from the Syrian regime on Thursday, relayed by the UN, and an assurance that such an incident would not occur again.</p> <p>The moves by the Turkish parliament followed a day of high tension on the restive frontier and at least 12 hours of artillery fire from southern Turkey at targets deep inside north Syria.</p> <p>Observers outside the country who had spoken to activists in Tel Abyad, about nine miles from the border, claimed an unknown number of Syrian soldiers had been killed by the Turkish fire and others had withdrawn from their bases.</p> <p>As the shellfire ceased shortly after sunrise on Thursday, officials in Ankara announced that Erdogan would turn to parliament for the same sort of legal backing that underpinned the country's operations against Kurdish groups in northern Iraq.</p> <p>Erdogan's motion said the shelling had been \"on the threshold of an armed attack\" and was a \"serious threat to Turkish national security\".</p> <p>The statement said: \"As part of the military operations being conducted by the Syrian Arab republic armed forces, starting from [20 September] aggressive actions have been directed against our country's territories too. These actions have continued despite our repeated warnings and diplomatic initiatives.</p> <p>\"Therefore, the need has developed to act rapidly and to take necessary precautions against additional risks and threats that may be directed against our country.\"</p> <p>Besir Atalay, the deputy prime minister, later said: \"The bill is not for war. It has deterrent qualities.\"</p> <p>On Thursday, Turkey moved troops and armour to the area near the town of Ak\u00e7akale, which was hit late on Wednesday afternoon by at least two shells fired from Syria. Officials said radar tracks had shown the firing point was about six miles inside Syria, near a military base used by regime troops.</p> <p>The Syrian strike was roundly condemned by Nato, of which Turkey is a member state, as well as the UN and US.</p> <p>Russia, a staunch ally of Damascus and backer of Bashar al-Assad, Syria's president, in the uprising, said it had asked its ally to explain what had happened and to apologise for any \"mistake\".</p> <p>Atalay later claimed to have received the indirect Syrian apology. There was no immediate comment from Damascus.</p> <p>Turkey and Syria had edged towards conflict in the summer when a Turkish jet was downed by a missile fired from Tartous, in Syria. On that occasion, Turkey invoked the Nato treaty that can require the powerful security body to defend a member state under attack. Ankara did not retaliate at the time but said it would do so against future provocations.</p> <p>Syria has accused Turkey of arming and sheltering the Free Syria army, its main adversary in the civil war. Syrian officials brand the rebel forces terrorists and say they are backed by foreign powers.</p> <p>Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Nato's chief, reiterated to the Guardian on Monday that Nato would not support a Libya-style military intervention in Syria. \"Syria is a very, very, complex society. Foreign military interventions could have broader impacts.\"</p> <p>An urgent meeting of Nato ambassadors hours after the Syrian strike produced a strongly worded statement condemning Damascus, but offered no hint that its anti-intervention stance had changed.</p> <p>\"The alliance continues to stand by Turkey and demands the immediate cessation of such aggressive acts against an ally, and urges the Syrian regime to put an end to flagrant violations of international law,\" it said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, close to 100 people were reported to have died across Syria on Thursday as fighting continued to rage in most parts of the country.</p> <p>The popular uprising, inspired by the Arab spring, which by earlier this year turned into an intensive armed insurrection, has claimed more than 30,000 lives and shows no signs of abating.</p> <p>Aleppo and Damascus are battle zones, as are most secondary cities and towns. The deteriorating situation in Syria poses an ever-increasing risk to neighbouring states, including Turkey, which is already battling an insurgency led by restive Kurdish groups in Iraq and Syria.</p>",
  "<p>I drag myself out of bed about 7.30am, grab some porridge with honey and bananas for breakfast and \u2013 if I'm in university that day \u2013 walk to campus, which is about two minutes away.</p> <p>I will have university one day a week and placement the other four days this year, now I'm in my second year. The day that I'm in university will be quite a long day \u2013 8.30am until 4-5pm.</p> <p>Everyone has a different placement. Some are quite similar. Last year I was working at a children's centre, under-fives and their families. That was quite good. I don't know my placement for this year yet. But it will be less university time and more placement time. There's a real emphasis on more practical learning.</p> <p>Lectures can be an hour or two. Personally, I really enjoy the ethics and body language and communication is the sort of stuff I'm really interested in. But everyone has their own preference. I know some people enjoy the law part; I don't like that \u2013 it's a bit dry.</p> <p>I'm at the University of Plymouth. We have six learning themes throughout the social work course. These consist of \"approaches to social work\"; \"contexts for social work\"; \"understanding the social world\"; \"values, attitudes and beliefs\"; \"wellbeing and social work\"; and \"what is social work?\" However, later in the course \"understanding the social world\", \"values attitudes and beliefs\" and \"what is social work?\" are integrated within teaching and will not feature as weekly teaching sessions.</p> <p>Relevant law and policy will also be covered, and there is a strong emphasis on the global perspective, as well a local and national one. There is also an emphasis of the service user being the expert.</p> <p>I usually grab lunch on campus. It's good because me and my course mates usually go to lectures together, then hang around to have lunch together. I think that's when a lot of real learning happens \u2013 when you're discussing what you've been taught.</p> <p>There is 56 people in my year group, with only eight men. In the previous years we have had practical sessions and also share learning experiences from practice during our tutor sessions. The university also arranges conferences and attending these are mandatory.</p> <p>We have assignments in which we must incorporate all learning themes, and often critically explore our practice. We also have an OSPA (observed simulated practice assessment) in which we receive information, video clips and audio clips of a fictional referral to social service. We must then complete an initial assessment under exam conditions. I usually stay on campus to do work. Last year I went back home, but it's too noisy to do work where I am now.</p> <p>I usually unwind on my Xbox, but I also like rock climbing. There's quite a good social life in Plymouth. Obviously, because we're on placement and we have a lot on at university we don't go out as much as other students \u2013 it's not really a party course. But we do have the weekends ...</p> <p>I decided to study social work because I was working as a refrigerator engineer \u2013 and I hated it because I was working with machines, and I didn't really care. I wanted to work with people.</p> <p>I think I want to go into child protection for a little while. I hear that there's a high burnout rate so not for too long though. I'm not sure what area I'll want to go into afterwards.</p> <p>If I was to give advice to social work students, I would say it's really, really hard and it's a lot of work. But it's really rewarding too, so I think if you're going to go into it then you have to do it whole-heartedly.</p> <p>I don't sleep very well, so I usually go to bed after 2am. The last thing I usually think about is that I should be asleep already.</p> <p><em>If you know someone who you would like us to feature in our Day in the life of ... series, let us know by </em><a href=\"mailto:jessica.fuhl@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><em>emailing us</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>Why not join our community?

  "<p>After a series of personal tragedies, Derek Langford hit rock bottom last year \u2013 he suffered a breakdown, took solace in drink and finally, attempted to take his own life.</p> <p>Mercifully, the pills did not work and he found his way \u2013 via his community psychiatric nurse \u2013 to a Green Gym near his home in Birmingham's Sandwell neighbourhood. The project, designed to improve people's mental and physical wellbeing through their involvement in conservation activities and run by <a href=\"http://www.tcv.org.uk/\" title=\"\">The Conservation Volunteers (TCV)</a>, has renewed his zest for life.</p> <p>\"I really was a total mess,\" admits Langford, 43, a former tarmacker. \"For months I just sat there, drinking \u2013 I just couldn't get out of it. I'm still living day by day, but overall I'm now in a much better place.\"</p> <p>Since last June, Langford has attended the Green Gym twice a week \u2013 frequently taking part in off-site activities such as dry-stone walling and hedge-laying and sometimes helping out at educational events for young people. He has made new friends and developed an appreciation of the importance of the environment.</p> <p>Along the way, he attended training courses and has now been made a team leader, with responsibilities which include carrying out risk assessments on new project sites. Separately, in the evenings, he also started volunteering with a local homeless project.</p> <p>Green Gym is just one of the initiatives run by TCV, a charity which works to reclaim and protect green spaces across the UK. Most of its practical projects take place on other people's land \u2013 National Trust sites, for example, or local authority parks or school grounds. Many of TCV's participants \u2013 or volunteers, as the charity prefers to call them \u2013 have additional needs, for example through disability, mental illness or a history of substance abuse.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.tcv.org.uk/hollybush\" title=\"\">Hollybush Centre</a> in Kirkstall, Leeds, has been running for 30 years, and is part way through a four-year grant from the Big Lottery Fund. Working closely with <a href=\"http://www.leedsmind.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Leeds Mind</a>, the NHS and, sometimes organisations in the housing or social sectors, it sends volunteers to build pocket parks and recreation spaces, remove invasive species and repair walls on the Pennine moors. It also offers gardening and cooking sessions for those less happy to go out in the minibus.</p> <p>Individuals can be referred by services such as drug and alcohol support, <a href=\"http://www.mencap.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Mencap</a>, hospital occupational therapy and job centres, as well as self-referrals.</p> <p>Increasingly, staff are trying to gauge participants' interests and moving them towards employment, and this year they started working with <a href=\"http://www.leedscommunityhealthcare.nhs.uk/\" title=\"\">Leeds Community Healthcare</a> \u2013 formerly the PCT \u2013 to encourage volunteers who want help tackling their alcohol use, smoking or weight problems.</p> <p>In turn, GPs and other clinicians may suggest that patients consider volunteering with TCV as a means of increasing their activity levels.</p> <p>Hollybush manager John Preston says: \"In any given group you might see people with a brain injury, someone with a sensory impairment such as deafness, and people with profound cognitive impairments, who may struggle to remember things.</p> <p>\"Some of our volunteers can be very isolated \u2013 we sometimes become a key part of people's social and even family life in some ways, because of the amount of time they spend here.\"</p> <p>Preston says those in the organisation often develop good relationships, because volunteers turn to them when they are in distress \"because they know us.\"</p> <p>\"When one long-standing volunteer who had mental health and alcohol issues suffered a relapse but was refusing to go to A&amp;E, we were able to intervene, make contact with that person's partner and bring the problem under control,\" he says. \"People come here and we give them the space to do things. We try to give them more responsibilities \u2013 in time they may end up running a group.\"</p> <p>The centre's 12 staff rely on a team of voluntary supervisors or \"key volunteers\" to help run their activities; attendees who have been promoted, retired people and sometimes social care students. In time, Preston also hopes to develop an evening \"friends of\" group, which would allow volunteers who have moved on to maintain a relationship with TCV and their peers.</p> <p>Encouraging individuals to take on more responsibility can have a huge impact on their lives. Preston fondly recalls one volunteer who, before arriving at Hollybush, had barely left his home for four years because he was horribly bullied at work. After a stint of volunteering, the same man was able to get up and speak to TCV's national board of directors. He recently began a two-day-a-week diploma course and is now searching for part-time work.</p> <p>Back in Birmingam, Langford is also acutely aware of the value of this approach. \"The people who run the Green Gym have a lot of faith in me and see my potential,\" he says. \"I had lost faith in myself but my confidence has come back up and I now have the will to live again.\"</p> <p><em>Starting on Friday 5 October, </em><a href=\"http://www.tcv.org.uk/biggreenweekend\" title=\"\"><em>The Conservation Volunteers' Big Green Weekend</em></a><em> aims to encourage people to get involved in looking after their local green places, from creating community gardens and clearing footpaths to conducting wildlife surveys and fundraising for local conservation projects</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/healthcare/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",
  "<p>It was 50 years ago today. There in the Parlophone schedule, next to the King Brothers, Shane Fenton and the Fentones, Matt Monro, the Temperance Seven and James Brown (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xU7rMEnebQ\" title=\"\">Shout and Shimmy</a>: a future Mod perennial, later <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKTMxDci1yE\" title=\"\">covered by the Who</a>) is the Beatles' first single for the label. Out of the 11 records in those particular \"Latest Releases\", only two were hits, Monro's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cSa6e-YrWQ\" title=\"\">My Love and Devotion</a> (29) and Love Me Do \u2013 which after a tortuous 12-week journey through the darker reaches of the charts eventually hit No 17 in the last week of December.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MG_1YArtZto?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MG_1YArtZto\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MG_1YArtZto\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to listen to Love Me Do</a></p> <p>The Beatles had the biggest hit of that week's releases \u2013 a fact which did not reflect the label's confidence in their new act. The story of their audition with George Martin and their signing to EMI in June 1962 is common knowledge, of course. The Beatles' story has been told and retold so many times and it would be easy to write off Love Me Do as a stale tale, a simplistic stepping stone to future glory. But that would be ahistorical, and would serve to deny this strange, atmospheric single its due.</p> <p>Listening to it with fresh ears, Love Me Do sounds unlike anything else in the charts of the day \u2013 only the prominence of the harmonica in the arrangement recalls Bruce Channel's soulful <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4w1Mp6Mce4\" title=\"\">Hey! Baby</a>, a No 2 hit in the UK in spring 1962. Autumn that year was dominated by Elvis, Frank Ifield and the Tornados' Telstar. The biggest British act of the time was Cliff Richard; the biggest producer Norrie Paramor (Cliff, Ifield, the Shadows) who had 26 weeks at No 1 that year.</p> <p>Placed within that company, Love Me Do is weird. It's not compressed to hell like the Joe Meek productions of the day, nor string-sweetened like much of Paramor's output. It's dry, stark, almost \"live\": the extreme simplicity of the lyric and, on occasion, the stop/start, almost halting arrangement \u2013 check out the oddly burlesque bass drum \"boomph\" at around 1'52\" \u2013 makes you think that this is a group operating near the limits of their ability.</p> <p>And thereby lies a tale. For such an apparently plain song, Love Me Do caused a lot of problems. It was first recorded on 4 September 1962, with new boy Ringo Starr on drums. Doubts were raised about his performance, and the song was redone a week later, with session drummer Andy White: Ringo was relegated to tambourine. So there are two versions out there: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG_1YArtZto\" title=\"\">the very slightly longer 4 September take was on early pressings of the single</a>, only to be replaced sometime in 1963 with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCU-JM6sPxU\" title=\"\">the later version</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gCU-JM6sPxU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gCU-JM6sPxU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gCU-JM6sPxU\">Listen to the later version of Love Me Do</a></strong></p> <p>It wasn't always certain that Love Me Do would be the first single, anyway. Producers were all-powerful then, and George Martin had a ready-made pop tune for the group to record: Mitch Murray's How Do You Do It?. After a quick and competently unenthusiastic run-through, the Beatles balked, insisting on recording their own material. Martin eventually went with Love Me Do, and gave <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqH8YHqKAdI\" title=\"\">How Do You Do It? to Gerry and the Pacemakers</a>, who took it to No 1 in April 1963.</p> <p>The difference between the two songs shows just how anomalous Love Me Do was in autumn 1962. How Do You Do It? is charming, catchy but just too pat: the ebbs and flows of teen romance are captured in lyrics that err on the side of cloying. The melody boxes the group in, and they are reduced to sounding collectively cute \u2013 not a happy aural experience nor a true reflection of their characters. Murray was born the same year as Lennon and Starr, but might as well as have been on a different planet.</p> <p>In contrast, Love Me Do is, once you get past the primitivism, is soulful and bluesy. There is a swing and drive to the harmonica playing and the harmonies that belie the impression of tentativeness. The lyric, while entirely within period romantic cliches, is both slightly awkward \u2013 \"love me do\": who ever says that when they're chatting someone up? \u2013 and direct (\"someone like <em>you</em>\"). Which makes it a pretty faithful expression of teen courting rituals, with their mixture of uncertainty and desire.</p> <p>As the first Beatles' hit, this unassuming but forceful record has had a long after-life. The second version was included on several best-selling UK EPs and LPs and went Top 5 when rereleased in 1982 as a single. Right at the end of the first flush of Beatlemania, in late May 1964, it hit No 1 in the US \u2013 a strange turn of events for an 18-month old song. This in turn ensured its place as the opening track on the <a href=\"http://www.thebeatles.com/#/albums/1\" title=\"\">1 album</a>, which has sold over 31 million copies during this century.</p>",
  "<p>\"Sorry to keep you waiting. My snake is about to shed.\" In 25 years of writing this is certainly the most unusual excuse I have ever heard, and Maeve Moorcroft is one of very few people who could get away with it.</p> <p>Moorcroft is head of pets for <a href=\"http://www.petsathome.com/\" title=\"Pets at Home website\">Pets at Home</a>, responsible for all areas of health and welfare of the thousands of animals that pass through the doors of the nationwide chain.</p> <p>I am meeting her the morning after a very difficult evening for both her and Pets at Home: BBC's Watchdog programme had run a lengthy feature on the health of a few of the pets sold by the store. I thought Pets at Home was going to fare quite well after seeing the first segment, which mostly related to a couple of cases of ringworm in guinea pigs; but the second part involved undercover filming in several stores, showing dead fish in tanks. A few looked like they had been dead for several days.</p> <p>\"We were answering calls until 11pm last night,\" Moorcroft says. As we walk around the head office in Wilmslow, Cheshire, it's clear more are still coming in, and one or two colleagues (you are not allowed to use the word \"staff\" at Pets at Home, everyone is a colleague) stop Moorcroft for advice or to ask her to talk to the pet owner on the other end of the line.</p> <p>Moorcroft, who is Irish, qualified as a vet in Dublin in 1990 and spent 10 years working in the Peak District dealing mainly with domestic animals, \"with the odd sheep and wildlife emergency thrown in\". She met her husband to be, a shepherd who now runs their farm, after treating one of his sheepdogs on New Year's Eve, and now has two sons aged seven and five.</p> <p>Like many vets, Moorcroft found that the long and often unsociable hours of being in practice did not fit well with having a family. She switched to working for a pet product manufacturer as their veterinary adviser, helping to make sure their products were safe and suitable.</p> <p>Three years ago she moved to Pets at Home, becoming the first vet to hold the position of head of pets, involved in all areas of health and welfare of the company's pets, fish and reptiles. Among other things, the role involves liaising with suppliers, checking where animals come from, supervising their care in store and overseeing the stores' adoption centres.</p> <p>She runs a team of about 10, including specialists in reptiles and fish, and two veterinary nurses working in a support role. Given the size of the company \u2013 320 stores employing about 5,500 people with a turnover of \u00a312m a week \u2013 this seems quite a modest number.</p> <p>Moorcroft spends part of the morning answering emails and calls, mostly from the stores or vets contacting her about animals bought from Pets at Home, and is briefed by her team on the progress of a new range of guides published in association with the RSPCA and the licensing of various stores.</p> <p>The open-plan office she sits in is like no other I've ever visited. There are a couple of dogs meandering between a selection of baskets and bean bags, and nearly every desk includes an aquarium or vivarium holding a wide array of fish, snakes, reptiles and amphibians. Moorcroft's snake, Jean Genie, sits in a tank on her desk.</p> <p>She moves on to visit a Stockport store with a specialist aquatic centre and featured prominently in the Watchdog programme. The staff are upset, and there is a high manager-to-colleague ratio on the shop floor to reassure staff and deal with customer inquiries.</p> <p>While <a href=\"http://www.petsathome.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Info_10601_watchdog_-1_10551\" title=\"Pets at Home: Response to Matters raised by Watchdog \">Pets at Home disagreed with some of the points</a> made by the BBC programme, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mg74/features/pets-at-home\" title=\"Pets at Home - Do their pets really come first?\">chief executive Nick Wood issued a statement</a> saying the company would review its health check training and the frequency of the checks on its fish tanks.</p> <p>We meet \"Fishy\" Pete, a marine biologist who is one of Moorcroft's team, to inspect the fish: cold water, tropical and marine. The tanks are spotless and the only inverted fish is one which Pete assures me likes being upside down.</p> <p>Some vets have a poor opinion of pet shops, and until recently the RSPCA has opposed the sale of animals through a shop environment. Has Moorcroft received flack from her veterinary peers for switching over to pet sales? \"Veterinary science is a vocation, and I spent all those years in college because I wanted to help animals. Now I'm in a really good position to do that. Yes I'm one step removed, but I can get things in place to make things better,\" she says.</p> <h2>Curriculum vitae</h2> <p><strong>Hours</strong> Officially 8.30am to 5pm. Five weeks holiday plus bank holidays.</p> <p><strong>Work-life balance</strong> \"It's better than when I was in practice, and getting better still because of my veterinary nurses.\"</p> <p><strong>Salary</strong> The average starting salary for a vet can be anything between \u00a321,800 and \u00a333,500 a year, depending on experience. However, further training and experience can increase the average salary to around \u00a336,500. Moorcroft's salary is equivalent to that of a senior vet, who can earn upwards of \u00a350,000.</p> <p><strong>Best thing</strong> \"Getting the chance to influence the health of thousands of animals all around the country.\"</p> <p><strong>Worst thing</strong> \"Laying awake at 4am, worrying about guinea pigs and rabbits.\"</p>",
  "<p>Projects to reduce carbon emissions and create sustainable communities may seem ambitious for small community organisations. But community groups across the UK are proving that they can make a contribution to sustainable development when they get support.</p> <p>With the <a href=\"http://www.transitionnetwork.org/\" title=\"\">transition movement</a> providing inspiration and funds, promoting sustainability and environmental initiatives have become a realistic prospect for small organisations. And a project carried out by the University of St Andrews ffound that local authorities' resources and expertise can help communities deliver their ambitions.</p> <p>The project, led by Rehema White, a lecturer in sustainable development, looked at the barriers preventing communities and councils from working together on sustainability. It also tried to bring both parties together.</p> <p>\"Community groups often perceive local authorities as an obstacle to engagement in green activities\", says White. \"But in reality, community groups and local authorities share many common goals. This project aimed to design a strategy for them to work together more effectively.\"</p> <p>Participants in the project included <a href=\"http://nhtt.org.uk/\" title=\"\">North Howe Transition Toun (NHTT)</a>, which at the time was developing plans for a cycle route linking remote communities with nearby transport hubs. Members of the group attended seminars organised by the university which introduced them to Fife council and other local stakeholders.</p> <p>Delegates were encouraged to meet, talk and establish mutually beneficial contacts. White says that staff from the council saw what community groups were doing, including NHTT's plans for the cycle routes, while community members discovered previously unknown council initiatives and areas of expertise.</p> <p>Few people in the community groups realised for example that Fife, with private partners, already collects methane gas from landfill to heat local housing, while the council was not aware that NHTT had received non-council funding to appoint and train local 'energy champions'.</p> <p>Crispin Hayes, director of NHTT, says the seminars were useful in taking the cycle routes project forward. \"There were several people at the council who wanted to move forward on these things. There was a fair bit of negotiation with landowners, some of whom were very intransigent. The council's help with that has been very useful.\"</p> <p>Hayes says that the fact that the council had a maintenance budget was helpful because NHTT only had access to capital funding at the time. \"What enabled this project to happen was for the council to take charge of the maintenance in the long term.\"</p> <p>Another example of a successful partnership between a council and the community is in north London where a tiny organisation in Muswell Hill teamed up with Haringey council on a \u00a3250,000 carbon reduction project. The council worked with <a href=\"http://mhsgroup.org/\" title=\"\">Muswell Hill sustainability group (MHSG)</a> on the bid to the mayor of London's <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/environment/climate-change/low-carbon-zones\" title=\"\">low carbon zone</a> fund. The bid built upon the vision of local people to make Muswell Hill a sustainable community and the broader ambition of the council to achieve a 40% CO2 reduction across the whole borough by 2020. The low carbon zone project, which covered more than 800 homes, was used by the council as a pilot to test how best to engage communities on this agenda.</p> <p>The project originated from the community, who had approached the council with the idea of bidding for the funding. A steering group was set up once the fund was awarded to oversee the project, coordinated by a council officer and made up of members of the Muswell Hill sustainability group, the social enterprise EN10ergy, resident and community volunteer representatives and traders' associations.</p> <p>By the end of the project, 650 doorstep conversations were held and 450 households went on to have a free home energy audit and installed a number of energy saving measures such as light bulbs and chimney balloons. Another 200 residents went on to install larger measures ranging from draught proofing, loft and cavity wall insulation and replacement boilers.</p> <p>Community owned solar panels were installed on the roof of the local Marks and Spencer store and on a local church. The feed-in tariff money received from the panels and sale of shares to local people provided an on-going source of finance for sustainability initiatives, including low cost loans for carbon reduction measures.</p> <p>Peter Thompson, a member of MHSG, says the council played a key role in working with the business community, providing meeting space and launching the low carbon loans. However, he says that it is important for community organisations to retain control in the areas of publicity and communications, rather than allowing the council to puts its stamp upon promotional material.</p> <p>Thompson says he was impressed with the calibre of the council employees he worked with. \"Where we were disappointed is that everything needed, like loan, had to go to legal, finance and it just takes so long.\"</p> <p>Thompson's frustrations, seemingly common complaints about large public sector organisations, are shared by Crispin Hayes. But he says that these problems can be reduced by finding the right people in the council. NHTT did this through the University of St Andrews seminars and by following their own leads.</p> <p>\"The key thing with working with the local authority is identifying a person that will get on and champion your project. They have resources and abilities that complement your group's.\"</p> <p>Thompson says that the low carbon zone project has taken his organisation from being a little group \"making nettle soup\" to delivering a big budget project. He advises other groups that it is essential to have a partnership with the council on a project of this scale. \"They can do things that you as a little group can't.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Turkey's parliament has given legal authority to the military to launch cross-border raids into Syria in response to Wednesday's deadly mortar strikes that killed five civilians and edged the two former allies closer to a big conflict.</p> <p>The vote to allow the military to cross into Syria at any point over the next year was passed by 320 votes to 129.</p> <p>Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday that Turkey did not want war with Syria following the shelling on the town of Ak\u00e7akale, but was determined to protect its borders and its people. \"We want peace and security and nothing else. We could never want to start a war,\" Erdogan said. \"Turkey is a country which is capable of protecting its people and borders. No one should attempt to test our determination on the issue.\"</p> <p>Erdogan suggested the Syrian shelling was not accidental, saying shells had fallen on Turkish territory on seven previous occasions since the civil war began.</p> <p>The UN security council also issued strong condemnation of the Ak\u00e7akale attack. A security council statement on Thursday night said: \"This incident highlighted the grave impact the crisis in Syria has on the security of its neighbours and on regional peace and stability.\"</p> <p>The council demanded an immediate end to such violations of international law and called on the Syrian government \"to fully respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbours\".</p> <p>The statement managed to bridge differences between the US and its western allies which were demanding a strong text and Syria's most important ally, Russia, which tried to soften the text.</p> <p>Ankara said it had received an apology from the Syrian regime on Thursday, relayed by the UN, and an assurance that such an incident would not occur again.</p> <p>The moves by the Turkish parliament followed a day of high tension on the restive frontier and at least 12 hours of artillery fire from southern Turkey at targets deep inside north Syria.</p> <p>Observers outside the country who had spoken to activists in Tel Abyad, about nine miles from the border, claimed an unknown number of Syrian soldiers had been killed by the Turkish fire and others had withdrawn from their bases.</p> <p>As the shellfire ceased shortly after sunrise on Thursday, officials in Ankara announced that Erdogan would turn to parliament for the same sort of legal backing that underpinned the country's operations against Kurdish groups in north Iraq.</p> <p>Erdogan's motion said the shelling had been \"on the threshold of an armed attack\" and was a \"serious threat to Turkish national security\".</p> <p>The statement said: \"As part of the military operations being conducted by the Syrian Arab republic armed forces, starting from [20 September] aggressive actions have been directed against our country's territories too. These actions have continued despite our repeated warnings and diplomatic initiatives.</p> <p>\"Therefore, the need has developed to act rapidly and to take necessary precautions against additional risks and threats that may be directed against our country.\"</p> <p>Besir Atalay, the deputy prime minister, later said: \"The bill is not for war. It has deterrent qualities.\"</p> <p>On Thursday Turkey moved troops and armour to the area near the town of Ak\u00e7akale, which was hit late on Wednesday afternoon by at least two shells fired from Syria. Officials said radar tracks had shown the firing point was about six miles inside Syria, near a military base used by regime troops.</p> <p>The Syrian strike was roundly condemned by Nato, of which Turkey is a member state, as well as the UN and US.</p> <p>Russia, a staunch ally of Damascus and backer of Bashar al-Assad, Syria's president, in the uprising, said it had asked its ally to explain what had happened and to apologise for any \"mistake\".</p> <p>Atalay later claimed to have received the indirect Syrian apology. There was no immediate comment from Damascus.</p> <p>Turkey and Syria had edged towards conflict in the summer when a Turkish jet was downed by a missile fired from Tartous, in Syria. On that occasion, Turkey invoked the Nato treaty that can require the powerful security body to defend a member state under attack. Ankara did not retaliate at the time but said it would do so against future provocations.</p> <p>Syria has accused Turkey of arming and sheltering the Free Syria army, its main adversary in the now blazing civil war. Syrian officials brand the rebel forces terrorists and say they are backed by foreign powers.</p> <p>Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Nato's chief, reiterated to the Guardian on Monday that Nato would not support a Libya-style military intervention in Syria. \"Syria is a very, very, complex society. Foreign military interventions could have broader impacts.\"</p> <p>An urgent meeting of Nato ambassadors hours after the Syrian strike produced a strongly worded statement condemning Damascus, but offered no hint that its anti-intervention stance had changed.</p> <p>\"The alliance continues to stand by Turkey and demands the immediate cessation of such aggressive acts against an ally, and urges the Syrian regime to put an end to flagrant violations of international law,\" it said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, close to 100 people were reported to have died across Syria on Thursday as fighting continued to rage in most parts of the country.</p> <p>The popular uprising, inspired by the Arab spring, which by earlier this year had morphed into an intensive armed insurrection, has now claimed in excess of 30,000 lives and shows no signs of abating.</p> <p>Aleppo and Damascus are battle zones, as are most secondary cities and towns. The deteriorating situation in Syria poses an ever increasing risk to neighbouring states, including Turkey, which is already battling an insurgency led by restive Kurdish groups in Iraq and Syria.</p>"
