  "<p>Fleet Street has become an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2009/jul/24/news-agencies-sun\" title=\"\">anachronism for the newspaper industry</a>. The fear is that the media's capacity for investigative reporting, in an era of plunging revenues and an uncertain digital future, becomes similarly outmoded.</p> <p>Mark Watts is on a mission to reverse this. The geographical bit he has already accomplished; his investigative news website, Exaro, is run out of offices in Fetter Lane, a stone's throw from Fleet Street's famous El Vino wine bar where the great and the good of the industry once gathered.</p> <p>The second bit \u2013 generating enough paying subscribers for the site to break even within three years of launch \u2013 will be more difficult. <a href=\"http://www.exaronews.com/\" title=\"\">Exaro</a> \u2013 Latin for \"plough\" or \"dig up\" \u2013 is bankrolled by the millionaire investment fund manager Jerome Booth (worth a reputed \u00a3189m). Watts, a former journalist at the defunct Sunday Business, is editor-in-chief.</p> <p>\"Raising any significant revenue is clearly challenging in this environment in which most consumers expect to get information and news material online for free,\" says Watts.</p> <p>\"But the challenges are not insurmountable. We don't need enormous revenues to make the thing work.\"</p> <p>Exaro bills itself as \"holding power to account\" at a time when mainstream media, says Watts, has lost its appetite for investigative journalism.</p> <p>\"There was an increasing feeling both in broadcasting and in newspapers that it wasn't worth the resources, that it takes too much time and money and the readership was not that interested,\" he says. There are exceptions, however, notably the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/phone-hacking\" title=\"\">Guardian's phone-hacking revelations</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/\" title=\"\">Daily Telegraph's MPs' expenses scoop</a>.</p> <p>\"It hasn't died,\" says Watts. \"But most journalists spend their time rewriting press releases and wire copy. Our aim is to develop an investigative site which is producing material for which people are prepared to pay.\"</p> <p>One year old this month, Exaro has scored some notable scoops, including the <a href=\"http://davidhencke.wordpress.com/2012/03/22/how-the-student-loan-tax-scandal-broke/\" title=\"\">revelation that the head</a> of the Student Loans Company, Ed Lester, avoided paying thousands of pounds in income tax, leading to a wholesale review of the tax affairs of public officials.</p> <p>The site has a core staff of half a dozen, including the former Guardian Westminster correspondent David Hencke, who broke the Lester story, out of about 35 contributing journalists. Watts says it as an \"incredibly lean operation\".</p> <p>The site is free \u2013 although users have to register \u2013 with plans to introduce its first subscription element in the next few weeks. Initially the price will be heavily discounted, with breaking news stories remaining free of charge.</p> <p>Watts is aiming at an audience of professionals \u2013 he lists lawyers, accountants, bankers, senior civil servants \u2013 for whom paying for content online (ft.com, for instance) is not anathema.</p> <p>It has teamed up with rival media outlets (such as BBC2's Newsnight) to give stories a bigger shop window and send the Exaro name out into the ether.</p> <p>\"If you were to do a cuts check on the number of times we have been mentioned in the national newspapers, it's an astonishing number for a tiny outfit that sprung up a year ago,\" says Watts. The Guardian's national newspaper archive counts 31.</p> <p>But he admits: \"If you stopped the average person, even in the City, the proportion of people that would have heard of us won't be as high as we need it to be in the long run.\"</p> <p>Exaro was the product of a small team that included Tim Pendry, who also runs the PR company TPPR and the media finance specialist David Baxter, who is the firm's chief executive and worked at BSkyB. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LckL-eufErM\" title=\"\">Booth, head of research</a> at <a href=\"http://www.ashmoregroup.com/\" title=\"\">Ashmore Investment Management</a>, was the first person they approached to fund it.</p> <p>Unlike the seemingly similar operations <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/\" title=\"\">ProPublica</a> in the US or the UK's <a href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/\" title=\"\">Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a>, which rely on philanthropy for funding, Booth wants his money back and more. \"He is someone who has invested in the business and is hoping at the end of the day to get a return on it,\" says Watts.</p> <p>But he declines to say how much Booth has invested, or what price the site will charge users. Nor will he talk traffic numbers, either current or target.</p> <p>Annual running costs are off limits as well. \"I'm not going to get into that because I don't know off the top of my head. I just know the editorial spend is modest in relation to the output.\" The site puts up an average of about four new stories a week.</p> <p>Watts began his career at the Hull Daily Mail, specialising in investigative reporting, before getting his national newspaper break on the Sunday Express. After a foray into television, including working on ITV's long-defunct World in Action, he joined Andrew Neil's Sunday Business, from which he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/jun/07/pressandpublishing.citynews\" title=\"\">won just under \u00a36,000 in damages</a> after suing for unfair dismissal in 2002.</p> <p>Watts was dismissed after sending two emails complaining about the dismantling of the paper's investigative unit, which he headed. \"They fired me for writing these two memos which they called 'gross misconduct',\" he remembers. \"It was a ridiculous thing to say and from my point of view it was about clearing that slur.\"</p> <p>He went on to present a daily newspaper review show on the Iran-backed TV channel Press TV. The news channel has since had its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/20/iran-press-tv-loses-uk-licence\" title=\"\">licence to broadcast in the UK revoked</a> by the media regulator, Ofcom, after, among other things, broadcasting an interview with an imprisoned Newsweek journalist obtained under duress.</p> <p>\"The programme I did was as presenter and executive producer, I had clear editorial control,\" says Watts. \"There were other things going on at the channel, mostly not from the London bureau, that were outrageous. That all postdates my time there.\"</p> <p>Watts left after it was suggested his contract was changed to remove the executive producer role. \"I saw that as a precursor to removing my editorial control over the programme, which would be unacceptable.\"</p> <p>One former colleague describes Watts as \"a very serious-minded, slightly awkward character, verging on the obsessional, who is totally convinced of the importance of what he does. He's not a laugh-a-minute kind of guy. He collects admiration rather than friendships.\"</p> <p>Watts's 2005 book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Fleet-Street-Sewer-Rat/dp/1903906156\" title=\"\">The Fleet Street Sewer Rat</a>, exposed some of the \"dark arts\" of British newspapers including \"bin raiding\": going through the dustbins of celebrities, their lawyers and accountants, famously practised by Benji \"the Binman\" Pell.</p> <p>\"I was very conscious at the time that everyone was saying 'I can't believe you are going to spill the beans, this is like <em>omert\u00e0</em>, you keep this stuff secret,'\" says Watts.</p> <p>He says he was aware of phone hacking but \"focused specifically on bin raiding because I had lots of very good source material on that, whereas phone hacking, all I knew was what people in the industry were telling me about it, I didn't have any documents.\"</p> <p>Of the conclusions of the Leveson inquiry, due next month, Watts warns: \"There are real dangers in what will flow from Leveson.</p> <p>\"I do think there will be all sorts of people in positions of power clamouring to introduce mechanisms that will shackle journalists in one way or another, but it remains to be seen.</p> <p>\"It's healthy that we've learned about newspaper practices, as someone who started revealing them a long time ago, and it's healthy that other things have been flushed out beyond what newspapers get up to. Exactly what will flow from it, I think we should all be on our guard.\"</p>",
  "<p>The government's \"green deal\" scheme, intended to give householders a environmental makeover, launches on Monday without any of the country's large retailers signed up \u2013 despite a promise that they would play a central role in offering the deal to consumers.</p> <p>Major retailers such as supermarkets and DIY stores are viewed as essential to the success of the scheme as they are trusted by customers and have the necessary reach to cover the population.</p> <p>But none is ready to join the launch, with several telling the Guardian they would \"wait and see\" how the scheme worked out before making a final decision whether to support it.</p> <p>B&amp;Q, which has been courted by ministers, said it was \"finalising its position\", while Tesco said it already offered a range of energy efficiency options independently of the \"green deal\" and Marks &amp; Spencer said it was waiting for more details.</p> <p>The John Lewis Partnership told the Guardian: \"We have not made a decision on whether this is a commercial opportunity for us, but are interested to see how the market and legislation develop over the coming months.\" Sainsbury said it was interested, but was likely to make any plans for an offering through British Gas.</p> <p>The absence of large retailers from the launch lineup underlines the difficulties and confusion that have surrounded the scheme, which has faced a barrage of criticism from experts who have warned it will be too complex and could disadvantage poorer people.</p> <p>Under the scheme, households will be able to sign up for improvements such as insulation and renewable energy installation, paid for through loans that are paid back by additions to their energy bills. The loans are attached to the property, so future buyers will have to pay for past improvements, but the repayments should be offset by energy savings.</p> <p>Ministers are urgently considering how to give people a financial incentive to sign up to the deal. Officials have been working for months on a system of cashback incentives that could amount to \u00a3200m, but final details have not yet been settled, in part because of the complexity. Any incentive would have to be capped per household, at a level still not decided.</p> <p>Charles Yates, associate director at professional services network Grant Thornton, said the failure to get big-name retailers on board from the launch highlighted the problems and delays that have beset the scheme.</p> <p>\"Their brand is very important to them, they protect it zealously. If they thought [the scheme] was robust enough to get involved, it would be a big vote of confidence \u2013 the fact that they are not shows we are still not there yet.\"</p> <p>He said getting retailers on board would be crucial. \"The M&amp;Ss of this world could be very powerful advocates, these are very trusted brands. It would be a very positive sign to see a big advertising campaign \u2013 this is not just the green deal, it is the M&amp;S green deal.\"</p> <p>Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of Energy, said he was \"very alarmed\" by the delays in setting up the scheme. But he added the possibility of using council tax deductions as an incentive was still under consideration. \"If that emerges too, you're starting to build a package that will change the whole atmosphere of gloom around the green deal,\" he said.</p> <p>The Department of Energy and Climate Change said more companies were expected to sign up to offer the scheme to their customers within the next few months.</p> <p>From Monday, householders will be able to register to have their home assessed for green deal improvements. Accredited inspectors will give advice on efficiency measures ranging from loft insulation, typically costing no more than about \u00a3200, to double glazing and the far more expensive solid wall insulation, which can cost more than \u00a37,000 for a typical home.</p> <p>But people will have to wait until 28 January for work to start on any improvements, and for loans to be approved. This phased introduction allows ministers to fulfil their promise of launching the scheme this autumn, while giving companies additional time to design their offers and put the means in place to deliver them.</p> <p>Ministers want large and small companies to get involved, ranging from household names down to one-man-band builders. They see this as a way to create jobs while cutting emissions and helping people lower their energy bills.</p> <p>But the consumer watchdog Which? warned consumers must be protected from \"dodgy\" practitioners who might try to take advantage of the complexities of the system. Richard Lloyd, its executive director, said: \"We will be watching closely to see if people get ripped off. Any poor practice must be stamped out as quickly as possible.\"</p> <p>Other concerns have focused on the cost of the loans. The Green Alliance thinktank has calculated that if loans are made at commercial rates of interest homeowners may wait for years or never see a payback. Poverty campaigners said poorer and more vulnerable people could lose out, as they are less able to access loans and would be put off by the additions to their energy bills.</p> <p>One study found the rate of takeup could be lower than for previous schemes to improve energy efficiency as consumers were confused by the complexity of working out interest rates and likely savings.</p> <p>The Federation of Small Businesses warned small businesses were likely to reap \"very little benefit\" from the deal, as \"potential cost savings are eaten up by rising energy bills\".</p> <p>Yates said much was still unclear about the scheme. \"I suspect it will start off rather slowly,\" he said. \"There are so many questions around takeup and what investment will be needed from the private sector \u2013 an awful lot of businesses just see so many uncertainties on key issues, like the availability of finance. Companies have been hanging back. We are keen that it should work, but we're not quite sure yet.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Campus</h2> <p>This is the geographic area where all the buildings connected to a university or college are located. For some \"campus universities\" this can also include student accommodation \u2013 great for rolling out of bed into the library \u2013 while others have their buildings and accommodation spread out over a wider area</p> <h2>College degrees accredited by a university</h2> <p>Many further education colleges offer stand-alone courses accredited by and in partnership with universities that have degree-awarding powers. For example, if you complete a foundation degree in forensic science at Weymouth College the qualification will be awarded to you by Bournemouth university. You could then go on to complete a full degree by dropping into the final year of a higher education 'top-up' course in the same field.</p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Further education colleges tend to offer lower course fees, so this can be a more affordable route to getting a degree</p> <h2>Distance learning</h2> <p>This is when online and printed course materials, combined with tutorial support \u2013 online, face-to-face and by telephone \u2013 replaces campus-based teaching. Will Swann, director of students at the Open University, which specialises in this kind of learning, says: \"Students could have a full-time job, family commitments or have a disability. Some younger students may want to 'earn and learn' by starting their career at the same time as they study. We even have six members of Team GB from the 2012 Olympics currently studying with us because they really need that flexibility\"</p> <h2>Freshers' week</h2> <p>This is the name given to the first week of university, when hordes of nervous and excited new students descend on the campus. As well as being an important time to settle in, register and choose your modules, it is better known for non-stop parties and the chance to get to get to know your new peers. Zoe Bulaitis, editor of Exeter's student newspaper, remembers hers as: \"socialising until your jaw hurts from talking\u2026 worth it in the end though!\"</p> <h2>Halls of residence</h2> <p>\"Halls\" are the accommodation offered by a university, mainly for first-year students. Traditionally involving long corridors with lots of small bedrooms and a big canteen for meals, many halls now consist of blocks of self-catered flats.</p> <p><strong>Tip: </strong>Think carefully about what type of halls would suit your personal needs best and apply early to avoid disappointment</p> <h2>Lecturer/professor</h2> <p>\"Lecturer is the starting level teaching job at a university,\" says Charlotte Hodes, who was made a Professor of Fine Art at the London College of Fashion this spring. \"Professorships are either awarded as part of a high level role at a university or as an acknowledgement of an outstanding achievement in their field. Lecturers usually have more contact with the students, especially at starting level, but don't think that a lecturer isn't experienced either \u2013 you can get a lot out of them if you try!\"</p> <h2>Lecture/seminar</h2> <p>A lecture is a simple presentation in which a tutor will explain an aspect of a particular subject while students learn by listening and taking notes. Seminars are more interactive and often involve questions and tasks being put forward by the tutor. Importantly, seminars involve more critical debate and discussion led by the students.<strong> </strong>While the back row of a lecture theatre can be a point of salvation for a late-runner, turning up 20 minutes into a five-person seminar is definitely not recommended...</p> <h2>LNAT</h2> <p>The National Admissions Test for Law is an aptitude test designed specially to assess whether a candidate has potential to study law at undergraduate level. It is a multiple-choice exam that judges candidates on the verbal reasoning skills that are critical to legal studies. It is used in conjunction with A-levels and the rest of a candidate's Ucas application to decide more fairly who to accept on to a course.</p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Familiarise yourself with the style of exam by taking practice exams on the LNAT webpage: <a href=\"http://www.lnat.ac.uk\" title=\"\"><em>lnat.ac.uk</em></a></p> <h2>Master's</h2> <p>Once you have completed your undergraduate degree, you may decide to move on to postgraduate study. If so, then a master's degree is likely to be what you end up doing. A master's is more in-depth, specialised in a particular academic field or professional practice, and involves far more independent learning</p> <h2>Personal statement</h2> <p>This is a really important chance to add a bit of personality to your Ucas application. It is an opportunity to explain why you are the right person for the course, demonstrate your enthusiasm and give some insight into your other interests and hobbies</p> <h2>PhD</h2> <p>The highest level academic award. These are research-based, and a successful PhD student will make an original contribution to the knowledge of their subject. Recipients also earn the title of doctor on completion</p> <h2>Reading week</h2> <p>This is a short period of time away from teaching, usually before exams, and is a chance for students to catch up with the reading for their course or get started on that all-important revision</p> <h2>Russell group</h2> <p>This is an association of 24 universities that have some of the best reputations for research and teaching in the UK. All of the six \"red-brick\" universities, which include Manchester, Leeds and Bristol, are in the Russell Group, as are more modern institutions such as Exeter and York. These universities are very popular with students and entry to some courses can be highly&#xa0;competitive</p> <h2>Sandwich course/ joint honours</h2> <p>A sandwich degree is a four-year undergraduate course in which students spend a year in industry, or on a relevant placement. A joint honours degree is when two subjects are studied simultaneously, merging aspects of each within the same period of time as a single&#xa0;honours</p> <h2>Student services</h2> <p>Your go-to point for information and advice relating to the practical matters of university life. This is where you need to go if you require financial help or advice, academic or emotional support, or need to replace your lost student card\u2026again</p> <h2>Student society</h2> <p>Societies, or \"socs\" are facilitated by your students' union and are groups or clubs for people who share specific interests. From sport to media, art to politics, there can be hundreds of cheap-to-join societies at a university</p> <h2>Students' union</h2> <p>These \"exist to change students' lives for the better,\" says Liam Burns, NUS president. \"They represent you at university, providing welfare services, entertainment and social activities such as clubs, societies, music venues and bars. Students' unions are democratic bodies, so their leaders and policies are decided by you. If you think your union could be run better or do more for students, get involved and change it. It could change your life\"</p> <h2>Tariff system</h2> <p>To accommodate the broad range of qualifications that university applicants may have, Ucas uses a points-based system to help admissions tutors compare students. Every different type of qualification and the grade achieved is allocated a certain number of points. Each course will require either a certain number of tariff points, or minimum grades at A-level, for example: 300 points, or grades ABB</p> <h2>Types of degrees</h2> <p>When someone refers to their \"degree\" they usually mean their bachelor's degree, which is awarded after the completion of an undergraduate course. The two main types of degree are: BA, which is a bachelor of arts; and BSc, which is awarded for science, but there are many other types with similar abbreviations. Most bachelor's degrees in the UK are awarded with honours, or (hons), according to the grade you receive</p> <h2>Ucas</h2> <p>The University and Colleges Admissions service: processes more than 2m applications for full-time undergraduate courses each year using a special online system. Prospective students fill in online their qualifications, personal statements and the universities they hope to attend. Your account will be updated when you receive your offers</p>",
  "<p>Nothing should stop you going to university if you have the ability and the aspiration. It will be a life-changing, transformative experience and the opportunities that arise from being part of an academic community are huge.</p> <p>You need to think ahead, plan and budget \u2013 but it will be a hell of a lot of fun, and you'll make friends from all walks of life.</p> <p>Don't let fear of debt be the reason you don't go to uni. The loan is a complicated financial product but it is not a financial barrier, and it's very safe and available to everyone, means-tested against household income. You will repay your loan back at 9% over \u00a321,000; it is written off after 30 years, and graduates are faring best in the employment market.</p> <p>When deciding where to study it's important to visit the universities you are interested in. Don't just pick a place from a prospectus \u2013 see it for yourself, get a feel for the atmosphere and talk to the students.</p> <p>Think about whether you want to live on campus, or in a city, or at home. Do you prefer to learn in a work-based style or tutorial style? Do you do better with exams or continuous assessment, large lectures or small tutor groups, and how long are terms and semesters?</p> <p>Think about what your educational needs are \u2013 studying at university is very different to school. In terms of subject choice, what do you really enjoy?</p> <p>When I applied to uni I was going to study physics and law, but I did some work experience at a firm of lawyers and decided that law was not for me. I chose physics because I enjoyed it, and although I'm not now doing anything directly related, I think the skills I learned are transferable. I learned about analysing problems, decision-making, how to construct and present information, and improved my numeracy and literacy in IT. These are the skills that companies want. They also want people who are inter-disciplinary \u2013 so think about how flexible your course is.</p> <p>Take your studies seriously \u2013 you will get so much more out of being self-disciplined. There is a huge volume of work and a lot of it is self-guided. And remember, most students have to balance their studies with working part-time to boost their finances.</p> <p>But university is not just about work: one of the best things that will happen is that you will meet so many people. There are so many opportunities \u2013 sports clubs, societies, studying abroad, work experience in the long summer&#xa0;months.</p> <p>And get involved in your students' union \u2013 the NUS is a campaigning organisation and we are fighting to get more money in students' pockets. It is one of the strongest networks in the country and you can learn so much from it.</p> <p><em>Interview by Sarah Jewell</em></p> <p>\u2022 Liam Burns, 27, is president of the National Union of Students, and studied&#xa0;physics at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh <em> </em></p>",
  "<p>There was no great frustration to Sergio Ag\u00fcero's assessment \u2013 his outlook born more of an acceptance that this is simply one reality of the modern global game \u2013 yet an issue was still there to be highlighted. The Argentinian is in his second season in the Premier League after five years in Spain, and so spoke with authority when suggesting that homegrown players benefit from a privilege not afforded to foreign imports by domestic referees.</p> <p>The point was delivered in the aftermath of a timely win, not resentfully following a defeat but in a climate where players who are perceived to tumble too easily under challenges find themselves increasingly under scrutiny. Ag\u00fcero's Manchester City team had two appeals for a penalty turned down on Saturday when Carlos Tevez and Pablo Zabaleta were floored in the area, but neither incident felt overly significant given that the visitors still emerged victorious. Liverpool's Luis Su\u00e1rez has drawn more of the focus in recent times, as he did at Carrow Road this weekend, yet the champions are clearly conscious of the debate.</p> <p>Asked if foreign players find life harder than English players in the Premier League when it came to officials' decisions, Ag\u00fcero was clear. \"Yes. Always,\" he said. \"But it happens everywhere [in the world]. There is a little bit of privilege with players who come from that country. That is normal. We just play our game, and the referee's job is to know who is tricking him and who is not.\"</p> <p>The City manager, Roberto Mancini, may have referred to Peter Crouch's recent goal for Stoke, where the forward used his hand to control the bouncing ball before converting, when bemoaning previous ill-fortune amid a \"difficult\" run of results, but Ag\u00fcero's observations did not reflect a sense of grievance simmering at City.</p> <p>Rather, his was a general observation on playing in alien surroundings. Are referees innately suspicious of foreign players? \"Maybe, yes,\" said the striker. \"It can happen, but I don't think it did here [at Craven Cottage]. If it does, it's not good for anyone. Here in England, there are almost as many foreign players as English players and it's not right that some have a privilege that others don't.\"</p> <p>There was an irony that the only penalty awarded here was soft, and granted to a Norwegian in John Arne Riise after Zabaleta's slight tug. No team in the top flight can match the 14 nationalities Fulham have utilised in the Premier League to date this season, and yet Mladen Petric was still able to convert the spot-kick with ease to suggest City's recent sloppy form might be maintained.</p> <p>The real privilege on view, however, was the depth in quality of the visitors' options. Ag\u00fcero had equalised just before the break but Mancini still flung a mouth-watering array of attacking talent into the fray to register a first win in five attempts, ending with six forward-thinkers and two full-backs ever eager to charge ahead. Their second-half dominance of the ball was rewarded late with Edin Dzeko's emphatic winner.</p> <p>All four of City's main strikers \u2013 Ag\u00fcero, Dzeko, Tevez and Mario Balotelli \u2013 played for a period. \"We have four forwards with a good attitude \u2013 maybe Mario sometimes so-so \u2013 but they're all good players,\" said Mancini. \"It's difficult to put one or two on the bench but when they come on they can change a result, like today.\" Dzeko's goals in the campaign's early weeks might persuade the management to include him against Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday for a match City will feel they must win to inject momentum into their European quest.</p> <p>Fulham's own forward inspiration, Dimitar Berbatov, was absent here \u2013 and will be against Southampton on Sunday as he recovers from a thigh injury. \"Someone told me Dimitar had played 10 times against City and had lost only once,\" said Martin Jol ruefully. \"He has the qualities that can make a difference against a team like that, and that had given me confidence earlier in the week. So that was disappointing. But I still expected a bit more from my team. We looked as if we were playing for a point, and you can't do that at home.\" Their own improvement is ongoing, their resistance actually admirable until they were punctured late on. Both these teams will feel they are merely warming up.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> David Silva (Manchester City)</p>",
  "<p>The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, will unveil plans on Monday to stimulate the economy by using a \u00a33bn windfall from the sale of the 4G mobile phone spectrum to build 100,000 affordable homes, rather than to reduce debt, should Labour win the next election.</p> <p>He will say that it is time to \"cut through the dither and rhetoric and actually do something\".</p> <p>The move is politically bold since polls still show voters are anxious that Labour will not be tough enough to rein in spending. The 4G sale is due to take place next year, and Balls's choice reflects his belief that George Osborne is losing the argument over how best to deal with the&#xa0;deficit.</p> <p>Balls will make the announcement on the first full day of the Labour conference in Manchester, a day that also looks set to be marked by strenuous efforts to persuade a sceptical electorate that Ed Miliband has the leadership qualities and mainstream background to make him a prime minister that can reunite the country.</p> <p>Shadow cabinet ministers openly admitted that many voters still did not know Miliband, while Jack Straw, the former foreign secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/30/ed-miliband-better-britain-means-people\" title=\"\">urged the Labour leader to abandon abstract language</a>.</p> <p>Balls's decision to plump for a housebuilding programme instead of paying down debt reflects the Labour conference theme that the country is gripped by an economic emergency and that all short-term government energy must be focused on raising demand and boosting confidence.</p> <p>Gordon Brown used the \u00a320bn windfall from the much more lucrative sale of the 3G spectrum in 2003 exclusively to reduce debt.</p> <p>But Balls will say: \"In difficult times, we urgently need to put something back into the economy.\"</p> <p>Balls is estimating that the sale will raise \u00a33bn and proposes to spend \u00a32.5bn to build 100,000 affordable homes, allocating the remaining \u00a3500m for a two-year stamp duty holiday for first-time buyers on properties worth up to \u00a3250,000.</p> <p>Estimates have suggested that the sale of the 4G spectrum could raise as much as \u00a34bn, but the Treasury has not set out how it will use the revenue. The Liberal Democrats have also called for a large house building programme, but said it could be funded by guaranteeing funding for housing associations.</p> <p>Balls will say that 119,000 construction jobs have been lost in two years and there has been a 68% fall in the number of affordable homes being built.</p> <p>The shadow chancellor will put his argument for a housing stimulus in the context of a wider argument that Osborne's \"plan A\" is not working, noting that the deficit has risen by 22% this year due to the recession. He will say: \"There is nothing credible about a plan that leads to a double-dip recession, thousands of businesses bust, a million young people out of work, billions wasted on a soaring benefits bill, and borrowing going up not down. Rising borrowing not to invest in the jobs of the future but to pay for the mounting costs of this government's economic failure.</p> <p>\"Because this is the fundamental truth: if more people are on the dole, not paying taxes, you can't get the deficit down. If businesses are going bust, not hiring new workers, you can't get the deficit down. If the economy's not growing, you can't get the deficit down.\"</p> <p>But Balls will try to balance this attack by emphasising his call for a root-and-branch \"zero-based\" spending review in the first year after the election, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/27/labour-public-spending-ed-balls\" title=\"\">a proposal set out in the Guardian last week</a>. \"The longer this government staggers on with a failing economic plan, the worse it will get and the harder the job will be. Hard times will last longer than all of us hoped. And we cannot promise to put everything right straight away,\" he will say.</p> <p>Miliband's aides are hoping to use the conference speech and a subsequent party political broadcast to project the Labour leader as a grounded, authentic figure with values that will not change. The broadcast focuses on his time at Haverstock school in north London, and how he had important lessons in the complexity of the world from going to a school with children from many different races and classes.</p> <p>It shows one school friend from when Miliband was 12, Socratis Socratous, praising the way he picked things up so quickly and another friend, Lucy Lamb, lauding his trustworthiness, quiet steadiness and refusal to change who he was.</p> <p>The party released some school reports showing his cleverness, but also the irritation of teachers at his chattiness. Labour polling shows that many voters do not even know that Miliband, unlike David Cameron, went to a state school.</p> <p>He will also use his speech to contrast his beliefs with Cameron's \"chameleon\" qualities. He said: \"Four years ago, David Cameron was saying: 'I want to hug a hoodie and I want to hug a husky.' And now, he wants to lock up the hoodies and he doesn't give a damn about the huskies. People are always going to know where I stand \u2013 that is the most important test of leadership.\"</p> <p>But frustration was expressed by some senior figures at the slowness with which the party is translating some of its themes into policies. The shadow foreign secretary, Douglas Alexander, speaking at a Progress rally, said: \"We need more than a politics of anger. We need a politics of answers.\" He added: \"If we try and blame the Tories for everything there is a risk we are believed on nothing.\"</p> <p>Lord Adonis, responsible for Labour's industrial policy, said the challenge was \"turning big ideas into policy\".</p> <p>In a surprise addition, David Miliband, Ed's brother, told the rally that centre-left governments needed to be open, reforming, pluralistic and fiscally responsible.</p>",
  "<p>If there is one thing more unpredictable than the behaviour of anti-western leaders , it is the behaviour of the west's self-anointed friends. Mikheil Saakashvili, who swept to power in Georgia nine years ago in the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/4532539.stm\" title=\"BBC News: How the rose revolution happened\">rose revolution</a>, used to be the darling of Washington and Brussels. Young, aggressive, Atlanticist, intent on securing membership of Nato, Saakashvili appeared straight out of central casting. To the west, his message \u2013 in fluent English \u2013 was simple: back me and you will help a young democracy in the volatile Caucasus escape the neo-Soviet orbit of Vladimir Putin's Russia.</p> <p>Disaster ensued. In 2008, Saakashvili attacked a rebel enclave, South Ossetia \u2013 with substantial provocation from Moscow \u2013 and lost it permanently. One-fifth of Georgia's territory is now occupied by Russian troops and pro-Russian separatists. Saakashvili's rashness and Russia's brutal reaction stopped Nato's eastward expansion dead in its tracks.</p> <p>The rose revolution grew out of protests against electoral fraud. Eduard Shevardnadze's Georgia was not a tyranny, but it was terminally corrupt. Like the roads, the writ of the state expired a few kilometres out of the capital, Tbilisi. Almost a decade on, the revolution's promise on this has been met. Corruption is no longer a tool of government and as a result Georgia's prison population has quadrupled.</p> <p>That would have been used as a boast by Saakashvili until 11 days ago, when video clips showing prison inmates being sodomised by broom handles were aired by two opposition television stations. The clips revealed the other face of Saakashvili's revolution \u2013 its incipient and growing authoritarianism. Since 2003, there has been no change of power through elections, and in Monday's parliamentary elections Saakashvili's ruling United National Movement is determined to keep it that way. Electoral lists have been <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1R5CF0yba4\" title=\"\">doctored</a>, opposition figures and human rights activists have been attacked and arrested. Satellite trucks belonging to opposition channels have been damaged. Disproportionate financial sanctions have been imposed for violations of election law.</p> <p>The target of Saakashvili's fear is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/30/saakashvili-georgia-rose-revolution-elections\" title=\"\">Bidzina Ivanishvili</a>, an oligarch whose wealth is equal to half of Georgia's GDP. After years of quiet philanthropy, Ivanishvili burst on to the scene as the head of the Georgian Dream coalition. Accused of being a creature of the Kremlin and of attempting to buy votes, he has seen his support mushroom and stands a good chance under free elections. Saakashvili faces the biggest challenge to his authority yet. He is due to stand down as president next year, but under constitutional changes, power will transfer to the prime minister. Who does this remind you of? Vladimir Putin? Surely not.</p>",

  "<p>Nearly 900 women in the UK are <a href=\"http://www.breakthrough.org.uk/our_work/our_research/researching_breast_cancer/generationsstudy.html\" title=\"\"> diagnosed with breast cancer</a> each week. Yet according to a new report from Avon, a third of 2,000 British women surveyed never examine their breasts. Avon's Breast Promise campaign has teamed up with a psychologist to come up with tips to encourage women to regularly check their breasts. Daughters should be taught to check their breasts from 12 or 13 years of age, and be told it is as important as caring for their skin or hair. You should tell your family you will be checking your own breasts once a month, and set an automatic alarm on your phone to remind you.</p> <p>Or should you? Is examining your breasts useful?</p> <h2><strong>The solution</strong></h2> <p>We'd all like to think women can help themselves to detect breast cancer but research from the Cochrane Collaboration, which adds up the results of lots of studies, says there is no evidence that self-examination works. In fact there is evidence it does <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/jul/16/cancer.health\" title=\"\">more harm than good</a>. Breast self-examination causes anxiety and can provide false reassurance, if women miss cancers.</p> <p>There has never even been agreement on the right way for women to examine their breasts. A large study in Shanghai of 266,064 women aged between 30 and 64 years of age found that those given breast self-examination instructions <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1124918/\" title=\"\">had the same numbers of cancers detected</a>, and no reduction in the number of deaths. Women who examined their breasts had more biopsies for harmless lumps, which can cause scarring of the breast.</p> <p>What may be more useful is encouraging women to be aware of what their breasts look and feel like normally, rather than getting them to do a thorough regular examination. Being <a href=\"http://www.breastcancerindia.org/images/Article_European_Journal_of_Cancer.pdf\" title=\"\">\"breast aware\"</a> is preferred to self-examination by Cancer Research UK. This means looking out for changes in the nipple (a pulling inwards, bleeding or rashes), puckering of the skin, a lump or thickening that feels different, any change in the shape of the breast, how it hangs or if one breast becomes larger. Most cancers are found by women themselves (screening by mammography only finds one third to a half of breast cancers), the majority of whom don't practise self-examination but are aware of changes in their breasts.</p> <p>It's not clear from their report if Avon is suggesting women should self-examine or become breast aware. The report focuses on getting women into a habit of checking breasts. But they do seem to advocate monthly checks for which there is no evidence. As the authors of <a href=\"http://www.breastcancerindia.org/images/Article_European_Journal_of_Cancer.pdf\" title=\"\">a paper in the European Journal of Cancer wrote</a>, breast cancer support organisations should recognise their responsibilities. \"Intense promotional activity such as <a href=\"http://www.breastcancercare.org.uk/\" title=\"\">breast cancer awareness month</a> every October results in dismayed clinicians finding their clinics overcrowded with the worried well to the detriment of patients with breast cancer.\"</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 In the search for more genuinely working class candidates, Labour's ruling national executive nodded through a rule change in Manchester that the conference will endorse midweek: future selection panels will have to take social class into account, as they already do race and gender. How that will affect future leadership contenders such as fast-tracked Yvette Cooper (6/4 favourite according to William Hill) and Chuka Umunna (7/1) remains to be seen.</p> <p>\u2022 In choosing Michael Sandel, the market-debunking Harvard intellectual, for unprecedented conference exposure (he gave delegates an hour-long seminar), Ed Miliband officially outed himself as the geeky policy wonk friends admire and foes deride. Sandel's warning of the corrosive effects of \"everything has its price\" societies was undermined when he sat down and conference chair Michael Cashman said: \"Michael will be signing copies of his book. It's called What Money Can't Buy.\" \"That's something money can buy,\" Harriet Harman chipped in helpfully.</p> <p>\u2022 But in making the first of at least three platform appearances this week, was Ed defying Brown's first law of overexposure? In a timely blog yesterday, Damian McBride, Gordon Brown's take-no-prisoners spin doctor, appeared to suggest so. McPoison, as he became known after being sacked for dirty tricks, provided a gripping account of how, exactly eight years ago, he had to break the news to chancellor Brown (\"his head started to sink, then he put on his famous fixed grin\") that Tony Blair had announced he planned to serve a full third term. It happened in front of a plane full of nosy hacks when Brown was en route to the IMF in Washington. The chancellor's distress was based on the calculation that \"once you've had seven years [as he had at No 11], the public start to get sick of you\". That's why David Cameron, Tory leader since 2005, should be rationing his appearances, not going on the David Letterman show, says McPoison. Ed Mili was on that fatal flight with Brown and gets the point.</p> <p>\u2022 Or does he? Miliband is going back to his roots as a north London comprehensive school boy in a party TV broadcast this week, subtly to contrast his own pleb education with those \"aristocrats\" in the \"millionaire cabinet\", as conference delegates are calling them. Ed is not posh and helped other kids with their homework. All together now: ahhh.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Good day:</strong> Ed Balls. In the annual MPs vs Hacks football match, played at Salford FC's ground, he took a dive to win a penalty and scored two (Andy Burnham slotted home the third) in the MPs' 3-0 win.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Bad day:</strong> Harriet Harman. On Sky, she twice referred to David Cameron as David Miliband. A Freudian slip?</p>",
  "<p>Given that it is Tennessee Williams's best play, it is surprising how rarely we see Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Since its British premiere in 1958, it has had only three major London revivals. Although many people know it through the disastrously diluted <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nJXIPrUDtM\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Taylor-Paul Newman movie</a>, it is not that often seen on regional stages, either: I can trace four Scottish revivals in the last 15 years, but few in England. So Sarah Esdaile's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nJXIPrUDtM\" title=\"\">new production at the West Yorkshire Playhouse</a>, which opens later this week, should give us a chance to re-assess a play that, in the near 60 years since Williams started writing it, has been the source of endless controversy, confusion and debate.</p> <p>First, it's worth reminding ourselves what it's actually about. At its most basic, it confronts the issue that runs through all great American drama, from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/mar/30/eugene-o-neill-master-american-theatre\" title=\"\">Eugene O'Neill</a> onwards: the conflict between truth and illusion. Set on a rich Mississippi plantation, Williams's play shows the conflict from many angles. Brick, an alcoholic ex-athlete, refuses to sleep with his vivacious wife, Maggie, supposedly out of guilt over the suicide of his old friend, Skipper: what Brick is unable to confront is his own, and Skipper's, latent homosexuality. Brick's father, a towering patriarch known as Big Daddy over whose inheritance the family squabbles, is equally unable to face up to the fact he is dying of cancer. The two illusions meet head-on in the great father-son confrontation in the second act. But, although the play offers a social critique and rich southern humour, it finally asks whether it is better to live by lies or truth.</p> <p>This may be vintage Williams but right from the start this particular Cat has been dogged, so to speak, by argument. The <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4559930\" title=\"\">original 1955 Broadway production</a> ran for nearly 700 performances, won Williams his second Pulitzer prize and restored a reputation badly dented by the failure of Camino Real. But, even though it was a big commercial success, Cat raised a fundamental issue. Whose text was it \u2013 the author's or the director's? The nub of the matter is that the director, Elia Kazan (all-conquering after his 1954 movie, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeVq1e6JKlw\" title=\"\">On the Waterfront</a>), persuaded Williams to exchange his original third act for one the director approved of. Specifically, Kazan asked for a last act in which Maggie was shown more sympathetically, the dying Big Daddy reappeared, and Brick underwent some form of moral awakening. Williams eventually published both versions, inviting readers to make their choice. It's a measure of Kazan's awesome power and Williams's desperation for a Broadway hit (\"He wanted it passionately,\" said Kazan) that the author gave way to the director.</p> <p>Does it matter? I think it does. Williams's original version is leaner and sparer. Kenneth Tynan, writing about the text played on Broadway, picked up on a small, symbolic difference between the two. Williams's original has Maggie, uttering her big lie to win Big Daddy's inheritance, say: \"Brick and I are going to have a child.\" In the Kazan-approved version, this portentously becomes \"A child is coming, sired by Brick out of Maggie the Cat.\" Director Sarah Esdaile, after researching all Williams's variations, has gone back to a 1974 script that combines the best of both the original and the Broadway texts. I'll be fascinated to see how this revised version plays in Leeds.</p> <p>Textual variations are one issue. A far bigger one, in the 1950s, was Williams's handling of homosexuality. Some people thought the play went too far, others that it didn't go nearly far enough. The critic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Bentley\" title=\"\">Eric Bentley</a>, writing in the New Republic, thought Williams ducked the issue by not exploring further Brick's real nature. Having been told in advance that this was the play in which homosexuality would finally be presented without evasion, Bentley wanly concluded: \"The miracle still has not happened.\"</p> <p>But in Britain the whole subject was too much for the Lord Chamberlain, who then had the right to forbid plays a licence for public performance. It is blush-making to think that in 1958, when Peter Hall staged the British premiere of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, audiences had to go through the ludicrous fiction of paying to join a private members' club, <a href=\"http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/theatres/show/3277-watergate-theatre\" title=\"\">the New Watergate</a>, in order to see the play staged at the Comedy theatre. It is equally shaming to think that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVv_9jKRODI\" title=\"\">Arthur Miller's A View from the Bridge</a>, in which one man kisses another on stage, had to be presented under the same hypocritical banner. Only in Britain would it be assumed that payment of a small fee somehow insulated one from moral corruption; but such was the idiotic law until censorship's demise in 1968.</p> <p>America, however, had its own censorship problems. In the cinema, the outdated Hays' Code was used to limit freedom of expression. The irony is that one of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof's great virtues is that it shows Big Daddy's tolerant understanding of Brick's sexuality. Richard Brooks's ridiculous 1958 Hollywood film was obliged to water down Williams's message for public consumption. It may have had Elizabeth Taylor smouldering in a satin slip, but it offered no more than dark hints as to the reasons for Paul Newman's refusal to sleep with her and, as I recall, even denied that Maggie's attempted seduction of Skipper got as far as the bedroom. This was a badly neutered Cat that inspired Williams on one occasion to tell a queue waiting in line for tickets: \"This movie will set the industry back 50 years. Go home!\"</p> <p>The author wasn't much more thrilled with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqbV9GbveS4\" title=\"\">a 1976 Granada TV production</a>, starring Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner. Here, according to Williams, Laurence Olivier mistakenly conceived Big Daddy as \"a southern planter gentleman instead of a former overseer who struck it rich through hard work\". In fact, you have to leap forward to 1988 to find a British production that finally did full justice to Williams's symphonic play. This was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/oct/18/howard-davies-director\" title=\"\">Howard Davies</a>'s superlative revival at the National theatre, starring <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/feb/26/lindsay-duncan-interview-hay-fever\" title=\"\">Lindsay Duncan</a> as Maggie, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9AoFKgOBiw\" title=\"\">Ian Charleson</a> as Brick and Eric Porter as Big Daddy. Everything one hoped for was there: the social satire in the shape of Brick's elder brother, Gooper, moving in for the kill as his father's cancer is confirmed; the comedy in the form of the \"no-neck monsters\", who constitute Gooper and Mae's family, putting on a tackily choreographed display for Big Daddy; and the defiance of Duncan's Maggie, announcing her pregnancy with tilted chin as if challenging anyone to dispute it.</p> <p>Since that breakthrough production, London has seen two other major revivals. In 2001, Anthony Page staged the play with three American actors in the lead roles: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/04/brendan.fraser\" title=\"\">Brendan Fraser</a> as Brick, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0640323/\" title=\"\">Frances O'Connor</a> as Maggie and Ned Beatty as Big Daddy. I said at the time it caught well \"the passion and power of the state of Tennessee\", but it has left few indelible memories. Far more impressive was the 2009 import of Debbie Allen's Broadway production, with a distinguished all-black cast. Ethnicity mattered here less than the production's emotional firepower: <a href=\"http://london.broadway.com/buzz/140838/interview-sanaa-lathan-makes-a-red-hot-london-debut-as-maggie-the-cat/\" title=\"\">Sanaa Lathan</a>'s Maggie was so sizzlingly sensual she almost burned a hole in the satin bedsheets. The confrontation between <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0504412/\" title=\"\">Adrian Lester</a>'s Brick and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/nov/23/james-earl-jones-cat-roof\" title=\"\">James Earl Jones</a>'s Big Daddy was equally overwhelming: I've never forgotten the latter's shift from crude vulgarian, doing obscene pelvic thrusts as a sign of his sexual power, to anxious therapist as he sought to analyse and articulate his son's problem.</p> <p>It is probably easier now than it was in the 1950s to get a handle on Williams's play. A work considered salacious and sensationalist by some, and overly cautious by others, can now be seen in its true colours. What Williams does is expose the twin illusions, especially prevalent in the America in which he wrote, that sexuality is some kind of rigidly predetermined absolute, and that possessions can protect you against death. Above all, the play is an attack on a world in which we lie to ourselves and others; and it's a sign of Williams's subversive and still under-rated humour that, in finally supporting Maggie's lie, Brick adds to the mendacity he has hitherto assailed. It's an astonishing, multi-faceted play that, in Britain, has taken us decades to&nbsp;appreciate.</p>",
  "<p>When you have been secretary general of the United Nations for 10 years, it's never going to be easy to slip into humdrum anonymity. Kofi Annan gave it a good go. On leaving office he and his wife borrowed a friend's Italian hideaway, deep in the forests near Lake Como, and retreated into eight weeks of blissful solitude. With no TV, no radio, no papers; Annan was free, finally, from the clamour of the world's troubles. Two weeks in, he began to get bored.</p> <p>\"Let's go to the tobacconist in the village,\" he suggested, \"and buy a paper.\"</p> <p>They had been in the shop for less than five minutes before his heart sank. A group of men were gathered in the corner, staring. \"Oh no!\" he whispered to his wife. \"We've got six weeks to go, and we've blown our cover. How are we going to manage?\" One of the men approached and thrust out a pen and paper. \"Morgan Freeman, may I have an autograph?\" Annan flashed his best Hollywood smile, scribbled \"Morgan Freeman\" and fled.</p> <p>\"So when people say: 'Here's a man who needs no introduction,'\" he chuckles. \"I say to them, careful!\"</p> <p>As he's telling the story it occurs to me that a tourist's failure to recognise his successor would not constitute an amusing anecdote. Annan does have a curiously movie-star presence, flawlessly crisp and unusually still, but five years after leaving office he remains a more commanding presence in world affairs than <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/ban-ki-moon\" title=\"\">Ban Ki Moon</a>. \"I thought retirement was going to be easier,\" he smiles, \"but I discover it's hard work. I should do what Mandela says and retire from retirement one day.\"</p> <p>We meet just a few weeks after he stood down as the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/02/kofi-annan-resigns-syria-envoy\" title=\"\">UN's special envoy to Syria</a>, and his dismay at the ongoing carnage clearly hasn't faded. It's equally clear, however, that he saw no choice but to quit. \"The first thing I said to the security council was: 'This is a near-impossible task. I'm going to try, but I can only do it if I have your united and sustained support.' Because you need that support in order to put pressure on all the parties. 'United' is key. Be united.\" But the security council remained divided, and as a consequence, Annan says gravely: \"The Syrians are going to pay the price. It's an innocent people caught in the middle.\"</p> <p>The plight of Syria is, in a sense, an extension of Annan's new book, or an illustration of its fundamental message. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Interventions-A-Life-War-Peace/dp/1846142970\" title=\"\">Interventions: A Life In War and Peace</a> tells the story of his 50-year UN career, and of the emerging role of UN peacekeeping. It's a role with which Annan has been intimately linked, but humanitarian intervention \u2013 like Syria's future today \u2013 lies ultimately at the whim of the security council.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-394046026\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/8/2/120802AnnanStatement-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/8/2/120802AnnanStatement-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/8/2/120802AnnanStatement_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120802AnnanStatement/120802AnnanStatement.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/8/2/120802AnnanStatement_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/> </video>   <p>Until the early 90s, UN peacekeeping efforts had been minimal, most conflicts being adjudicated by the world's two superpowers, whose hostility ensured a security council too divided to authorise more than a handful of peacekeeping missions. Between 1987 and 1992 barely a single UN mission consisted of more than 100 observers, facing little personal risk. By 1994, however, 80,000 UN troops were deployed in highly dangerous warzones. Annan took charge of peacekeeping in 1993, and his book provides a fascinating account of the new challenges facing a security council that, no longer paralysed by division, finds itself the repository of global demands for something to be done about pretty much every problem in the world.</p> <p>\"Time and again, when member states and the governments are faced with an insoluble problem, and they're under pressure to do something, that something usually ends up being referred to the UN.\" He allows a wry chuckle. \"The security council is dealing it with it, so they can relax. And you get the mandates, yes. You just don't get the commensurate resources to deal with it, so you are bound to run into difficulties and fail. And then be blamed. One of my predecessors used to say the letters SG [secretary general] stood for scapegoat.\"</p> <p>The new appetite for humanitarian intervention was in its honeymoon period in 1993, when UN forces were committed in Somalia to what then US secretary of state Madeleine Albright declared \"an unprecedented enterprise aimed at nothing less than the restoration of an entire country\". But after rebels downed two US helicopters, the Americans pulled out, and the UN mission collapsed. The legacy of this failure, Annan writes, explains why the UN stood by and watched a massacre unfold in Rwanda a year later. When the world belatedly woke up to the genocide, UN peacekeepers were blamed for member states' reluctance to risk their own troops' lives.</p> <p>When it came to Kosovo in 1999, Russian support for Serbia ruled out any chance of a security council resolution mandating troops. For the first time in the history of the UN, its secretary general endorsed military action conducted by Nato without the authorisation of the security council. It was, by Annan's account, the ultimate moral dilemma; do loyalties lie with the UN and the rule of law, or with innocent civilians being slaughtered? He stands by his support for the Nato airstrikes, but warned at the time that unless the security council was restored as the sole source of legitimacy, the world would be \"on a dangerous path to anarchy\". That prediction proved horribly prescient four years later, when the security council failed to pass a second resolution authorising an invasion of Iraq, and the war went ahead anyway. The war came close to costing him his job \u2013 but to many of his admirers it became his finest moment.</p> <p>Annan was always doubtful about the extent of Saddam's hidden WMDs. \"The UN inspectors had been in there for quite a long time, and destroyed quite a few arms; in fact, people argued that they destroyed more weapons than the first gulf war. So the feeling was that he may have had something, but how massive, and the nature of the weapons, was unsure.\" So why wouldn't Saddam co-operate with the inspections? \"He had been bluffing to his neighbours for so many years, telling them: 'I'm powerful, I've got these weapons, don't mess with me.' It was a psychological bluff. So he couldn't bear to admit that actually he'd lied. I think that was the explanation.\"</p> <p>Annan's great regret was to appoint a gung-ho weapons inspector, insensitive to the delicacy of Iraqi military pride. Richard Butler, he writes, was \"a colossal mistake and one of the worst appointments I ever made\". Why? \"In a place like Baghdad, where the people are very nationalistic, you need to find a way to work with them. You cannot go there and throw your weight around.\"</p> <p>He still winces at the memory of all the grandstanding that led inexorably to war. Bizarrely, in the midst of all George Bush's fighting talk, the president told Annan: \"It brings tears to my eyes to think of what the Iraqi people are going through under Saddam.\" Annan is generous enough to say: \"I think it was genuine; I don't think it would be crocodile tears,\" but pretty blunt about Bush's other motives. \"There was quite a bit of that in the air, that he was trying to finish his dad's job. And the advisers around him also wanted that. They were also thinking, we kill two birds with one stone \u2013 we get rid of a bad dictator, and get rid of the weapons.\" What about the third bird \u2013 Iraq's oil reserves? \"Well that's what people say,\" Annan agrees with a chuckle. Those who say it have often been dismissed as lefty conspiracy theorists \u2013 but when I ask if Annan would say it himself, he replies without hesitation: \"Yes. It was a country with resources in a region of extreme importance to the world. I'm not sure if Iraq had been as poor as Somalia that there would have been that interest in going to save the country.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398420588\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348846778904/Kofi-Annan-in-Naqura-Leba-010.jpg\" alt=\"Kofi Annan in Naqura, Lebanon\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kofi Annan in Naqura, Lebanon in 2006, flanked by UN peacekeeping troops Photograph: Zohra Bensemra/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zohra Bensemra/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He is less sure about Tony Blair's motivation. \"Tony, at his best, in his heyday, would have been one of the most brilliant politicians of his time. But how he got himself entangled with this \u2026 I think there was a genuine friendship with Bush, but perhaps there was greater need on Tony's side than on Bush's. I wasn't sure if Tony genuinely wanted to go to war, or was just trying to protect the special relationship, and the special relationship trumped everything. It's difficult to say, because at the beginning he appeared to be on the right side, and he was also in favour of a second resolution. I hoped that would have been the point where you tell George: 'George, you are on your own. I'm not following you on this without the council resolution.' And I wonder what George would have said.\" Does he think it might have stopped him? \"I think it could have made a big difference.\"</p> <p>In 2007, Blair was appointed special envoy to the Quartet, a diplomatic mission created in 2002 by Annan himself to represent the US, EU, UK and Russia in peace talks on Palestine. I found Blair's appointment baffling, and tell Annan I struggle to see how he could \u2026 \"Do it?\" Annan completes the sentence. \"Yeah, yeah.\" So he shares the bewilderment? \"I share some of that. I was surprised that he accepted the role. And nothing much is happening on that dossier. For the past four to five years there has been no real Middle East mediation.\"</p> <p>Annan famously declared the Iraq war illegal, and has never regretted it. \"Because that was my genuine belief.\" But the price he paid took even him by surprise; \"The UN got attacked, and I got attacked personally. The Oil For Food situation was used to beat me up and also beat up the UN.\" The US made allegations of widespread corruption under the Oil For Food programme, which Annan believes were motivated entirely by a desire to punish him, for they took a sinister turn when his own son, Kojo, became implicated. Kojo had worked for a Swiss company, which in 1998 won a contract under the programme; he left the company that same year, but then came the revelation that, unbeknown to his father, it had continued to pay him for a further five years. Annan was mortified. \"And furious.\"</p> <p>It must have tested the father-son relationship to breaking point. \"Yes,\" he agrees uneasily, \"A friend of mine said: 'It's tough for you, but I also feel for your son. You come under the microscope not because of something you've done or who you are, but because of your father \u2013 and that makes life difficult for a young person.' But I said: 'There are certain things you just don't do.'\" Why hadn't Kojo told his father about the ongoing payments? \"Maybe, sometimes, if you think you need help from Daddy, you probably don't share all the information. I don't know. We're talking about a boy who was 22, 23 at the time. But now we are OK.\"</p> <p>The pressure from Washington was ferocious, but he never seriously contemplated resignation. \"It may have fleetingly crossed my mind. Sometimes you feel: 'Who needs this? Why should one put up with this?' But I felt it was a witch-hunt. So to walk away and give them the feeling that they have won? No.\"</p> <p>For all its ugliness, the onslaught against Annan was in essence no more than a manifestation of the fundamental tension underscoring his whole diplomatic career \u2013 the conflict between national self-interest, or realpolitik, and the loftier ideal of international law embodied by the organisation Annan served for 50 years.</p> <p>\"They clash, they clash,\" he agrees, with a smile. \"I think we've made progress, but you are right \u2013 the national interest still often trumps the broader interest. But what governments and people don't realise is that sometimes the collective interest \u2013 the international interest \u2013 is also the national interest.\"</p> <p>Born in 1938 into a powerful Ghanaian tribe, Annan had a privileged childhood in what was the Gold Coast, coming of age as his country won independence from Britain. Awarded a scholarship to study in America, he assumed he'd return to serve his nation, but a job with the World Health Organisation in Geneva introduced him to a \"worldly and engaging environment\", which made him reassess his loyalties. \"I began,\" he writes, \"to realise that community for me would mean something different from what it had meant to my father's generation.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398420589\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348846298199/Kofi-Annanon-Sesame-Stree-010.jpg\" alt=\"Kofi Annanon Sesame Street\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kofi Annan makes an appearance on Sesame Street in 2001. Photograph: AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How does someone with so little personal sense of national loyalty get through to men for whom it is everything? I've always wondered what Annan says to world leaders \u2013 often monstrous tyrants, even crypto-terrorists \u2013 to win their trust and persuade them to make peace. The book is full of references to marathon late-night phone calls to warring parties, and the art, he says, is quite simple. You have to understand what drives them, appeal to their pride and vanity, and offer them a way out that saves face.</p> <p>\"Dignity is very important. It's about dignity. Without beating up on them, I say: 'If you're really a leader, and are interested in the interests of your people, you have to lead; you have to show courage. If you are really a strong man as you say you are, you have to look out for the weak in your society. Look at what you're doing to them.' They have to feel that you have their interests at heart. These are people with egos, and a sense of legacy, so you ask: 'What legacy are you going to leave?' Saddam probably saw himself as a modern-day <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saladin\" title=\"\">Saladin</a> \u2013 the glorious Arab warrior. He saw himself as someone who was building his nation. So you tell him: 'You want all this destroyed? How do you think you will be judged?'</p> <p>\"That matters, because these people often have a certain image of themselves, and they will go to an incredible extent to protect themselves. So I tell them what their actions mean, how they are seen by the outside world.\"</p> <p>I suspect Annan must struggle to imagine how he will be judged himself, for his identity is so subsumed within that of the UN as to be almost indivisible. When I ask him to name the single greatest misconception about him, his first response is telling. \"About me, or about the UN?\" About him, I say. He falls into lengthy silent thought.</p> <p>\"That he's too soft,\" he offers eventually. \"Because they feel he doesn't pound the table \u2013 not assertive enough. But it doesn't bother me, because sometimes you don't have to fight to get your way. You don't have to pick a fight to get them to change their mind, or get them to see things your way. You really don't.\"</p> <p><em>Interventions by Kofi Annan is published by Allen Lane, rrp \u00a325.

  "<p>Slumping into the cramped confines of my seat, recovering my composure after a frantic, protracted check-in that made me mislay my wallet, almost miss my flight, and become \u20ac100 poorer, the result of my experiment in travel seemed obvious: boats and trains beat the pains of planes any day.</p> <p>But the real problem with air travel is not the carbon footprint, the hassle of security checks, the tedium of the boarding gate, the soulless sprawl of the hire car lot, or Ryanair's excessive excess charges and unavoidable fees for allegedly optional extras. The deeper issue is that how we travel reflects and shapes the way we think, and we have become a society of airheads.</p> <p>I started thinking about this because of a recurring desire to recreate an annual childhood journey by ferry and overnight train to visit our family in northern Italy. Was it just nostalgia pulling me, or is something of real value lost at 30,000ft? I decided to go to Italy the old way and return the new, to see how the experiences really compared.</p> <p>The passenger terminal at Dover docks did not provide the most promising start, having all the charm of a 1970s coach station. But once on deck, with the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m24_-tc4xGk\" title=\"white cliffs\">white cliffs</a> fading into the distance, I had a real sense of a proper trip starting, something that the palm-sweat-inducing jolt of take-off doesn't provide. The sedate passage of the ship, the gradual emergence of the French coast, and the disembarkation in the open air, with a real town in clear sight, provided a sense of the continuities between places. In contrast, planes simply transport you from one anonymous, homogenous edgeland to another, between airports virtually identical in their black and yellow signage and multinational franchises. It's the difference between travel \u2013 a movement between places in which the journey is part of the experience \u2013 and transit, the utilitarian linking of here and there, in which the destination becomes all that matters and the transfer simply something to put up with.</p> <p>This was most evident in the gaps between each leg of the journey. Stopping for an early dinner in Paris at one of Caf\u00e9 Charlot's street tables, the attraction of this is obvious. In contrast, the park next door to Gare Calais Ville is not exactly the idyllic location for a tasty picnic gathered from a nearby boulangerie. It appears to be a garden of lost souls, populated by people with vacant stares, not so much filling time as biding it, abiding in it, with no sense of anything to do. However, places like these and the makeshift tents and camps of asylum-seekers viewed from the bus from port to train station \u2013 interesting rather than obviously pleasant \u2013 often become the most memorable parts of journeys, and you only see them when travelling indirectly, in the interstices of the conventionally appealing.</p> <p>Consumer culture has made us too accustomed to getting only what we want, no more and no less. Experiences are atomised into their component parts, the extraneous excised in an attempt to maximise the impact of the parts we prefer, with no thought to how their context changes them. But if you only ever get what you know you already want, serendipity is denied and the richness of experience is reduced to the button-pushing delivery of crude hits of fun, excitement, novelty or reassurance, often consumed in the private bubble of home or headphone.</p> <p>In this respect, train travel on commuter routes has, alas, gone the same way as flying, as I am reminded on the two-hour TGV ride from Calais to Paris. But on longer distances, there is a palpably different attitude among travellers. Accompanying us in our four-berth couchette from Paris to Milan, for example, were Amanda and Ian from New Zealand. They were taking this trip because Amanda has a wonderful and vivid memory of stepping out of an overnight train into a Venetian dawn 20-odd years ago. Say what you like about flying, but <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cjLlR9aJRA\" title=\"North Terminal at Gatwick\">North Terminal at Gatwick</a> just doesn't have the same effect.</p> <p>In some ways train travel demands more of us. But even at 5.50am, after a night of interrupted sleep in a narrow bunk, the great terminus of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7A3TVZAQIc\" title=\"Milano Centrale\">Milano Centrale</a> has infinitely more charm than any baggage reclaim area. It is a contemporary malaise to avoid things that require effort but are rewarding in favour of gains in convenience that come at the price of blandness and loss of variety.</p> <p>How different the flight back was, starting with the frantic and pointless shifting of luggage from one bag to another required by Ryanair's punitive baggage policy. Worse, as I went to pay the \u20ac100 excess, I couldn't find my wallet, which had slipped unnoticed into the long-gone hold bag in the confusion. After rushing through security dangerously and predictably late, yet not predictably enough for us to have relaxed in the first place, the long queue of passengers is still boarding. The only redeeming feature of the whole flight was the magnificent view of the Alps from above.</p> <p>It might be objected that \"slow travel\" is just an indulgence of the time and cash-rich. But you actually gain holiday time when travelling is an integral part of the experience, because you lose none to mere transit. As for expense, the gap was not so wide, and was almost nothing after the excess baggage fee. And yet despite all I've written, I admit I have another trip coming up and, guess what, I'm flying. I'm just another airhead, led by apparent ease and convenience away from what is more profoundly rewarding.</p>",
  "<p>After an eventful year, China has cleared the decks for a wholesale change of leadership amid a particularly challenging set of circumstances. Turbo-powered growth has left the last major state ruled by a communist party facing a string of political, economic and social questions. The five-yearly party congress <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19755035\" title=\"\">on 8 November</a>, which will appoint the new leaders to steer the country through the rest of this decade, is, therefore, as important in its way as the US presidential poll two days earlier.</p> <p>Whatever the faults of the US system, the contrast between the competitive election across the Pacific, held after months of open policy discussion, and the closed-door transition of power in China is striking. For all the praise from foreign commentators about the way China works, that contrast points to a significant weakness in the system that tries to guide the world's second largest economy on a path of \"scientific&#xa0;socialism\".</p> <p>It has now been 63 years since Mao Zedong proclaimed the People's Republic, and the market-led economic reforms launched at the end of the 1970s&#xa0;by his successor, Deng Xiaoping, have changed the country and the world&#xa0;beyond all measure. But the basic power equation has not budged, confronting those in charge with the task of containing a society that has been brought to prefer materialism to Marxism or Confucianism.</p> <p>In many ways this is healthy. The traditional ruling method, stretching back to the <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/c/china_eastern_zhou_dynasty.aspx\" title=\"\">first emperor in 221 BC</a>, was patriarchal and despotic, and was picked up enthusiastically by the communists. But&#xa0;it sits on top of a country in which individuals enjoy a far greater degree of&#xa0;liberty, behaviour patterns are shifting fast, respect for authority is&#xa0;not what&#xa0;it was and technology \u2013 especially in the form of social media \u2013 has wrought a revolution.</p> <p>But the leadership, outgoing and incoming, acts as if nothing has changed. In the Leninist pecking order, the party ranks above the government and the real decisions are made in its politburo, which operates in the strictest secrecy. There is no open policy discussion. Control is everything. The institutions of civil society are absorbed into the official apparatus. Dissent is equated to subversion. Judges swear an oath of loyalty, not to China or to the legal system, but to the communist movement. The party's disciplinary commission can pick anybody up at will, without charge, and hold them for interrogation in a secret location.</p> <p>Occasionally, a corner of the curtain is lifted, as in the party's expulsion last week of the one-time rising star Bo Xilai, boss of the mega-municipality of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/15/china.china\" title=\"\">Chongqing</a> (32 million inhabitants) till last spring. He was accused of \"grave violations of party discipline\", \"massive bribery\", \"improper sexual relations with multiple women\" and \"errors and culpability\" in the cases of former Chongqing police chief <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/24/china-police-chief-wang-lijun-jailed?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Wang Lijun</a>, and Bo's wife, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/27/neil-heywood-unsafe-warns-scientist\" title=\"\">Gu Kailai</a>, who was convicted last month of the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood.</p> <p>Those charges may or may not be justified, but the fundamental reason for&#xa0;Bo's fall was the fear his ambition and ruthlessness aroused among his peers in the leadership, as he sought to join the supreme decision-making body, the politburo standing committee. For the last 10 years, under Hu Jintao, China&#xa0;has been run on consensus, a dictatorship without a dictator. That is certainly better than the days when Mao got out of bed in the afternoon and launched some adventurous scheme that brought death to millions. But it does not allow for the likes of Bo, who step out of the opaque central circle and plough their own furrow.</p> <p>The political defenestration of this champion of Mao-era values and of state control, who backed the use of the law against opponents, is no bad thing. But the way Bo's case was decided secretly by the politburo, after he disappeared, following his dismissal from his Chongqing post in the spring, is the antithesis of the rule of law. It was a power play in which the charges were personal, raising the question of how many others act similarly but evade censure by bowing to the rule of the centre.</p> <p>There was no debate about the policies Bo pursued \u2013 an awkward matter: Hu Jintao and his anointed successor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Xi Jinping</a>, went to the city to sing the praises of the \"Chongqing model\", but since then, photographs of&#xa0;their visits have disappeared from Chinese websites.</p> <p>Such issues go to the heart of the challenge the People's Republic faces. Its essentially conservative leadership is&#xa0;stuck in a system of opaque, top-down rule. Like the emperors before them, the&#xa0;leaders fear that change may&#xa0;bring down the whole edifice. But if&#xa0;the party has no alternative, its model&#xa0;is reaching its limits.</p> <p>Deng made the economy the driver of&#xa0;national revival and the party's's recovery from the implosion of the Cultural Revolution, but expansion is slowing down, shot through with inefficiency and excess capacity, and paying the price for the failure to address crucial issues such as land ownership, labour movement, capital markets and water and energy supply. Though the party claims to stand for the people, there are an estimated 150,000 popular protests a year. The lack of trust people feel covers everything from food safety standards to official pronouncements \u2013 \"Only believe something when the government denies it,\" a saying goes. Corruption and yawning disparities of wealth fuel resentment. The environment is a mess and the demographics are heading the wrong&#xa0;way.</p> <p>Still, for most of its people, this is the best time to live in China during the&#xa0;modern era. The material and social strides made in the past few decades are indisputable. But they have brought the need for a new approach from the top, and time is running out. If the new leadership cannot forge that, China's future will be far more uncertain than its&#xa0;recent past.</p>",
  "<p>In a glass mountain-top palace that looms over Tbilisi like something from a Bond movie, Bidzina Ivanishvili talks fondly of his penguins. It's not true, he says, that he keeps them in a special refrigerator. \"I have a breed capable of standing normal temperatures,\" he explains. He also owns several lemurs, a herd of deer and a pet zebra \u2013 not to mention a stunning collection of modern art, all financed with a fortune made in Russia.</p> <p>The billionaire is leading the country's once-divided opposition into the most important election since the rose revolution swept the old order from power almost a decade ago. For the first time, Mikheil Saakashvili \u2013 the hero of that hour \u2013 faces a real challenge to his authority in parliamentary elections on Monday that could change the course of this corner of the Caucasus. </p> <p>The poll is bitterly contested. This small mountain nation (population: 4.5&#xa0;million) on the doorstep of Russia is more polarised than at any time since 1991 and independence from the Soviet Union. At stake is whether Georgia moves towards genuine democracy, or whether the rose revolution that swept Saakashvili to power in 2003 fizzles out.</p> <p>The country is also at the heart of a strategic battle between Moscow and the west. Russia insists Georgia is part of its backyard. To prove a point, it invaded in 2008 after Saakashvili unwisely tried to grab back rebel South Ossetia. Washington and the EU say Georgia is a sovereign nation that can decide its own destiny. Two geopolitical visions, Atlanticist and neo-Soviet, collide in a landscape of ancient villages, medieval towers and breathtaking mountains.</p> <p>Until recently, Saakashvili and his ruling United National Movement party had been expected to cruise to victory. All this changed after the release by two opposition TV stations 12 days ago of a horrific video showing prison officers abusing inmates and sodomising them with broom handles. \"When I watched it&#xa0;I thought it was a nightmare. The images were just awful,\" said Khatuna Kipiani, an opposition supporter.</p> <p>The video revealed something rotten at the heart of Georgia's state. It has appalled Georgian voters, embarrassed the authorities, and led to a surge of support for Georgia's opposition and for Ivanishvili, whose $6.4bn (\u00a34bn) fortune is put at half of Georgia's GDP. He burst on to the political scene a year ago, following years of quiet philanthropy in which he had paid for police uniforms, restored crumbling churches and funded salaries for actors and struggling artists \u2013 a sort of Georgian fairy godfather.</p> <p>His Georgian Dream coalition, named after a song by his rapper son, lags behind Saakashvili's ruling party in the ratings. But it is catching up, according to the latest polls. On Saturday evening, 100,000 Georgian Dream supporters packed into Tbilisi's central Rustaveli Avenue. \"It is as clear as day \u2013 we will win and achieve another victory in the history of our nation,\" Ivanishvili told them. \"We will not let anyone separate us from civilisation, modern times and democracy.\"</p> <p>His rise has spooked the government. It has variously dismissed him as a Kremlin stooge, a political dilettante, a \"weirdo\", and an old-style paternalist. Government aides mock his zoo, kept at his village home in western Georgia. They also say his sprawling coalition includes unsavoury elements, such as xenophobes and fans of Stalin, who was born in the Georgian town of Gori. But, undoubtedly, Ivanishvili has plugged into a mood of popular discontent and fatigue with Saakashvili, who critics say has become increasingly dictatorial.</p> <p>Ivanishvili dismisses the government's many charges against him and says that it is Saakashvili who is the monster: \"I'm very happy that I'm physically here and alive. You don't know Saakashvili's true face. He's capable of doing some atrocious things.\"</p> <p>Thousands of observers have flooded into Georgia for the election. Lobbyists hired by Ivanishvili have bombarded members of the US Congress and other opinion-makers with emails promoting Georgian Dream and accusing Saakashvili of treachery. The Georgian government has hit back: all international visitors to Georgia, a land of ancient viniculture, receive a free bottle of Saperavi wine from passport control. The government also says that Ivanishvili is using his money, made in the 1990s, to buy the election.</p> <p>In a report on Saturday, Transparency International, which describes itself as an anti-corruption organisation, blamed both sides for presenting \"simplistic programmes\" for increased social spending. For many voters, it is poverty and unemployment that have driven them to support Georgia's opposition.</p> <p>Sitting in a Tbilisi park on a warm evening, next to a statue of Giorgi Leonidze, a Georgian poet, Manana Nizharadze said she was surviving on a state pension of just 100 lari (\u00a337) a month. \"We live very badly. Wages are low. Communal charges are high. We can't afford medicines,\" she said. \"Saakashvili is a bad person.\"</p> <p>Edward Saakashvili, a distant relative of the president, demurred. \"He's done good things. People don't like discipline,\" he said, tossing back a glass of schnapps.</p> <p>Many voters complain of the president's disastrous 2008 war with Russia. Both South Ossetia and Abkhazia \u2013 which broke away in the 1990s \u2013 are now home to a massive Russian military presence. Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, who famously described how he wanted to \"hang Saakashvili by the balls\", conducted military exercises there last week, a crude reminder to Tbilisi that Moscow could reinvade any time.</p> <p>\"Shevadnadze lost the whole of Abkahzia. Misha [Saakashvili] lost Ossetia. It was a big mistake,\" said Nizharadze.</p> <p>Saakashvili's own future is unclear. He is 44 and due to step down as president in January 2013. His government has enacted constitutional changes that will transform Georgia next year from a presidential to a parliamentary republic. This has fuelled speculation that Saakashvili is planning to \"do a Putin\", and perform a job swap that would see him hang on to executive power by becoming prime minister.</p> <p>His government colleagues, however, are sceptical of such a manoeuvre. \"Politically it's impossible,\" said Giga Bokeria, secretary of Georgia's national security council.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 October 2012 to correct the population of Georgia from 4.7 million to 4.5 million.</p>",
  "<p>The Labour party is changing, at an alarming rate. At a lunchtime Channel 4 fringe I listened to one of the party's rising stars. He is the son of a wealthy entrepreneur, the grandson of the high court judge Sir Helenus Milmo; he went to public school and became a corporate lawyer who buys his suits at Savile Row. In short, a toff rather than a pleb. He isn't one of the traditional conference-goers, a half of bitter at his elbow, a fag in his mouth, working out the block vote figures on a damp beermat.</p> <p>But he is also Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, tipped as the party's first black leader (his mother was half English, half Irish, his father Nigerian). There is a certain Tony Blair-style glossiness to him: shiny skin, plausible manner, ready smile. He sounds relaxed, matey, more at home on a breakfast TV sofa than at a lectern. He won't have to wait long for more preferment: I have seen the future, and it lurks.</p> <p>Then at the start of the conference proper we heard from Michael Sandel, like Ed Miliband a Harvard lecturer. Miliband likes gurus, and this one is a corker. \"He fills football stadiums in Asia,\" the Labour leader told us, though I doubt that he would fill many here. (\"We are pleased to announce that the match against Chelsea has been postponed. Instead we are going to hear a Harvard professor discuss how much of our lives should be dictated by market forces.\")</p> <p>Mr Sandel made the point, for an hour (at dictation speed, for the benefit of any Chinese football fans in the audience), that some things shouldn't be paid for. Apparently prisoners in Santa Barbara, California, can upgrade their cells for $90 per night, which struck me as pretty good value if the alternative is sharing a cell with a 6ft 4in tattooed man whose favourite game is Mummies and Daddies.</p> <p>Also, he was against children being given money to write thank-you letters. And he didn't like paid queue-jumping at the London Eye. Nor was he in favour of people buying their wedding speeches off the internet. It must be said that these topics have only rarely been raised at previous Labour party conferences. You cannot imagine Dennis Skinner bellowing, \"And the Tories think you can raise your glasses to the happy couple, thanks to the web! We say, 'The Tories will be toast!'\" Yvette Cooper, another future leader \u2013 she really does sound like a schoolteacher addressing a not very bright group of freshmen \u2013 introduced something called \"Your Britain \u2013 Labour's online hub, an electronic town square\".</p> <p>Call me an old cynic, but I suspect this is a brilliant way for the party leadership to ignore the membership in bulk, instead of ignoring it one by one, as previously. And we saw the latest party election broadcast featuring schoolfriends of Ed Miliband and some of his students from Harvard (annual fees 2012-13: $57,950.) Clearly the university is taking over the party. Whoever filmed the broadcast seemed to be waving his camera about at random, and to have a close interest in facial skin blemishes, many of which filled the screen. As I say, alarming.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama and Mitt Romney were gearing up on Sunday for three days of intense preparations for the first of the US presidential debates, which is almost certain to be the Republican candidate's last chance to turn around his struggling campaign.</p> <p>The 90-minute debate in Denver on Wednesday will be the first opportunity Americans will have to see the two candidates side by side and compare not only their policies but how they look and behave. The outcome could be decided by a hesitation in explaining a policy, a smart riposte or a display of arrogance.</p> <p>Each side took part in the usual ritual of talking up their opponent at the weekend in an attempt to dampen expectations. Paul Ryan, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, speaking on Fox News on Sunday, described Obama as \"a very gifted speaker\". Supporters of Obama claimed Romney had won nearly all of the debates during his gruelling nomination process.</p> <p>Estimates for the number of viewers in America range from 50 million to 60 million, almost double the number who watched the party conventions. There will be two additional debates, in Long Island and Florida, but it is the first that usually has the most impact.</p> <p>Obama, with significant poll leads in the swing states, can play defence, just getting through the evening without making a mistake. The onus is on Romney to make an impression.</p> <p>Chris Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, acknowledged on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that Romney would need to do well in the first debate. \"You're going to have tens of millions of people for the first time really tuning in and paying attention to this race ... On Thursday morning the entire narrative of this race is going to change.\"</p> <p>Both candidates were readying themselves for three days of intensive preparation. Obama, after a campaign event in Las Vegas on Sunday night, heads to Henderson half-an-hour's drive away for three days of preparation. Romney will also do three days of preparation, arriving in Denver Monday.</p> <h2>Do debates make a difference?</h2> <p>Some political analysts argue that the debates do not matter, usually ending inconclusively and quickly forgotten. Others point to debate moments over the last 52 years, since the first televised debate between Kennedy and Nixon, that have turned out to decisive.</p> <p>John McCain, failed Republican presidential candidate in 2008, who has debated with both Obama and Romney, did not anticipate any \"breakthrough\" moments, saying they they have become rarer in recent decades.</p> <p>\"I can't remember the last time there was one of these comments that grabbed everybody's attention because, frankly, the candidates are too well prepared,\" McCain told CNN on Sunday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396937031\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/09/27/0926_stage_460x276.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama and John McCain\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Then Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and  John McCain in their first presidential debate in 2008.

Hillary Clinton was a seemingly insurmountable 30 points ahead of Obama in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination until she hesitated when asked a question in a 2007 debate about illegal immigration. </p> <p>Tad Devine, a Democratic strategist involved in presidential campaigns from Mondale in 1984 through to Kerry in 2004, believes debates are important. He recalled Mondale jumped 23 points in a poll after having a good first debate with Reagan and that Gore lost a three to four point lead in 2000 after his debate with George W Bush.</p> <p>He argues it is possible for Romney to use the debate to mount a comeback.</p> <p>\"Romney has got to get himself back into the race. He needs voters to have one more look at him and this is it,\" said Devine.</p> <p>\"If the Romney team are smart, they will not try to do it all in the first debate. They need to make up some ground and get people to like this guy a little. It is all about how he comports himself. If they are smart and he starts repairing his image, you can change a lot in 90 minutes.\"</p> <h2>Preparations</h2> <p>Romney's campaign team has long argued that the debates are pivotal and, because of that, the candidate has been rehearsing since at least August, locking himself away for mock-up debates with senator Rob Portman from Ohio standing in for Obama.</p> <p>According to the Obama team, the president has had less time to prepare because of his White House duties, though he has occasionally taken time out for visits to the Democratic national committee's headquarters in Washington for debate sessions, with senator John Kerry standing in for Romney.</p> <p>The preparations at the rival camps will be intensive, with soundbites rehearsed over and over again. They will prepare on replicas of the Denver stage, the rehearsals filmed and analysed. </p> <p>Obama, with a tendency for long answers, is being encouraged by staff to be snappier. One of his advisers, Jen Psaki, said last week: \"The president is familiar with his own loquaciousness and his tendency to give long, substantive answers.\" </p> <p>The relentless preparations include appearance as well as policy, with ties and suits chosen to avoid blending in with the stage backdrop.</p> <p>Devine remembers that, in spite of all the detailed preparations for one Gore-Bush debate, one of the problems was a failure to check how Gore's make-up would look on camera. Viewers complained he looked \"too orangey\".</p> <h2>Expectations</h2> <p>It has become commonplace that, ahead of the debates, the two camps talk up the opposing candidate in an effort to lower expectations. Romney supporters talk up Obama's oratorical skills, while the president's campaign has been claiming that Romney has had a great deal of practice at debates during his nomination process.</p> <p>In reality, neither candidate is a great debater. Often forgotten is that Obama, while one of the best orators in the US, performed poorly at debates during the during Democratic primaries and caucuses before the 2008 election, though he improved towards the end. The White House spokesman, Jay Carney, at the time a reporter, admitted last week that Obama had become the nominee in 2008 \"in spite of his debate performances\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396937032\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/1/20/1327024713757/Mitt-Romney-and-Newt-Ging-007.jpg\" alt=\"Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich in the CNN debate\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich in a CNN debate earlier this year.

Obama will seek to exploit this to the fullest while Romney has to try to explain it away.</p> <p>Romney's success against Gingrich in debate was attributed at the time to his debate coach, Brett O'Donnell, who subsequently left his staff. O'Donnell, in an interview with the Associated Press last week, said Romney has to try to confront the 47% remark. \"He has to turn the 47% and make sure people understand the reasoning behind that argument, how that's the result of the president's policies.\"</p> <p>The dominant issue will be the slow economic recovery, from an unemployment rate over 8% to the burgeoning deficit and taxation. Other issues will be healthcare reform, immigration and women's rights. Foreign policy is not on the agenda until the final debate.</p> <h2>Debates that made a difference</h2> <p>The first televised debate between Kennedy and Nixon in 1960 cost the Republican the election. Kennedy looked better on television while Nixon appeared unshaven and ill at ease.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396937033\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/14/kennedy460.jpg\" alt=\"John F Kennedy, Richard Nixon, 1960 presidential debate \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon wait for the start of their televised presidential debate on 26 September 1960.

In 1980, Reagan won a debate and the election with the question \"Ask yourself, 'Are you better off now than you were four years ago?'\"</p> <p>Gore came off second best in a debate with Bush in 2000. Devine recalled that the Gore team thought it had won but the Bush campaign successfully spun to the press that Gore had looked arrogant, sighing repeatedly throughout the debate and rolling is eyes. The spin worked.</p>",
  "<p>Ed Miliband set out a populist tone on the opening day of the Labour party conference on Sunday by attacking the banks and threatening legislation to break up their retail and investment arms unless they showed a greater willingness to do so themselves.</p> <p>Miliband claimed the government had backtracked in its banking white paper on its commitments to separate the retail and investment arms. He is targeting banks, pensions funds and energy companies before his speech on Tuesday in an attempt to flesh out his call for a more responsible capitalism.</p> <p>But he also had to execute a hasty U-turn after he suggested on Saturday that he was not going to scrap the NHS reform legislation.</p> <p>Miliband is likely to battle all week to balance media demands for more policy substance with his own need to avoid expensive spending commitments more than two years from the election.</p> <p>Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on the opening day of his party's conference, Miliband said he had a \"very clear message\" for banks. \"Either they sort out themselves so that once and for all the high street bank is not an arm of the casino operation, or the next Labour government will by law split those banks up.\"</p> <p>He said: \"We need real separation, real culture change. Or we will legislate.\"</p> <p>The banks won two crucial lobbying victories in their attempts to water down proposals set out by the government-commissioned Vickers report into the future of banking.</p> <p>The first was that the government scrapped the Vickers recommendation that ringfenced banks should have stricter standards on how much equity they could issue compared with their assets.</p> <p>The second was that ministers allowed for interest rate and currency swaps to be sold from within the ringfenced arms of banks, putting them in the same category as ordinary loans and making them cheaper and easier to sell.</p> <p>Miliband said there had to be hard ringfencing, as proposed by Vickers, and a commitment to enforce the spirit as well as the letter of the commission report.</p> <p>The Ed Balls camp pointed out that Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, had claimed Vickers was being diluted. They stressed that if the banks did not implement Vickers, a full and total break between retail and investment arms would be imposed.</p> <p>Previously, Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, has warned against such an enforced, rigid split, telling an audience this summer that he understood why the Vickers inquiry had stopped short of such a recommendation. He said: \"There are lots of risks and complications and potentially perverse outcomes.\"</p> <p>There have been reports that the business secretary, Vince Cable, had been unhappy at the way in which the proposals had been watered down, but his aides denied this, saying he recognises that banks need to be able to rebuild their balance sheets if lending is to be encouraged.</p> <p>In a speech in August, Miliband called for a return to what he described as stewardship banking and claimed the government had caved in to a concerted lobbying campaign to water down the Vickers plans.</p> <p>The Labour leader has also suggested that the big five banks be pushed to sell off 1,000 branches and introduce transferable account numbers to make it easier for consumers to switch banks.</p> <p>Also in his BBC interview, Miliband said it was a political game to ask him whether Labour would support coalition tax and spending plans in 2015 and onwards.</p> <p>\"We'll set out our plans at the next election for what we're going to do in the next parliament, and that's what you'd expect us to do. We don't know what the government's going to be spending or doing in the next three months, frankly, because borrowing's going up under this government.\"</p> <p>The Labour deputy leader, Harriet Harman, said she had been mistaken in suggesting in a Spectator interview last week that Labour had already decided it would cut more slowly.</p> <p>Miliband also said Labour would reverse the coalition's cut in the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p.</p> <p>\"Next April, David Cameron will be writing a cheque to each and every millionaire in Britain for \u00a340,000,\" he said. \"If I was in government tomorrow, one change I would make in relation to the better-off \u2013 first change in a Labour budget \u2013 we wouldn't be cutting the top rate of income tax from 50 to 45p. If there was an election tomorrow [reversing the cut] is what we would do.\"</p> <p>Miliband backtracked on suggestions made on Saturday that he would not repeal the government's NHS reforms. Asked about the shakeup, Miliband had said that it would not be sensible to \"reverse it all back and spend another \u00a33bn on another bureaucratic top-down reorganisation\".</p> <p>Labour would instead find ways to \"put the right principles back at the heart of the NHS\", seeking a legal basis for the NHS based on \"co-operation, not competition\".</p> <p>Amid suggestions that represented a climbdown, the shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, issued a statement on Twitter which read: \"I'll repeal the bill. Full stop.\"</p> <p>On Sunday, Miliband said he opposed the bill because it \"puts the principles of competition, markets and money as the central defining principles of the NHS. That's the wrong set of principles. I want hospitals to be able to co-operate with each other, not to be sort of taken to court for colluding with each other, which is one of the things in this bill \u2013 they can be fined up to 10% of their income\".</p> <p>Labour says it will keep the commissioning groups set out in the bill, but remove the duty to compete. The remarks suggest Labour will not seek to restore primary care trusts, another top-down reorganisation NHS staff are unlikely to&#xa0;favour.</p> <p>The health minister, Norman Lamb, said it would be madness for Labour to repeal the coalition's Health and Social Care Act: \"To say repeal the act, effectively, is telling the NHS we're going to go through another complete restructuring. It would be madness to do that.\"</p> <p>Miliband also told the Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, that he was wrong to attack him for calling for a 1% cap on public sector pay, saying: \"He's entitled to his view, but he's wrong.\"</p> <p>The conference is expected to pass a resolution on Monday opposing a wage freeze and, in a sign of the tensions with the unions over fiscal discipline, the GMB general secretary, Paul Kenny, said: \"Next year is the test for the Labour party but if you ask me about Ed Balls I'd say he'd give aspirin a headache&#xa0;\u2026 he is still stuck in this time mode as if we were doing the prawn sandwich offensive around the City.\"</p>",
  "<p>Crispin Aubrey, the journalist, author and campaigner, who has died of a heart attack aged 66, came to national prominence when he was arrested under the Official Secrets Act in 1977. His subsequent trial and the campaign around it led to a re-examination of secrecy legislation and shone a light into some of the darker corners of the intelligence services.</p> <p>Born to Margery Aubrey, an illustrator, and her husband, Lawrie, an insurance broker, in Chipstead, Surrey, Crispin went to Leighton Park, a Quaker school in Reading, Berkshire. From there he won a scholarship to read English literature at Christ Church, Oxford.</p> <p>His journalistic career began as a general reporter on the Hampshire Chronicle. He joined Time Out magazine, then in its early, radical days, in 1974. He was one of the first investigative reporters to focus on the environment and nuclear energy.</p> <p>In the late 70s, Time Out became involved in exposing British and American government secrecy and dirty tricks, with the help of the dissident ex-CIA agent, Philip Agee. Agee and another Time Out reporter, the American Mark Hosenball, who had just co-authored an expos\u00e9 of GCHQ, the government's communications headquarters in Cheltenham, were served with deportation orders by the then home secretary, Merlyn Rees, \"in the interests of national security\". An ultimately unsuccessful campaign to halt their expulsions was launched, with Aubrey at its forefront.</p> <p>A former member of Signals Intelligence, John Berry, also outraged by the deportation orders, contacted Time Out, and Aubrey and the freelance journalist Duncan Campbell (my namesake), an expert in the field, went to interview him in north London. The Time Out phones had been tapped: the three were arrested by special branch as they left Berry's flat, and were held in Brixton prison.</p> <p>The ABC defence campaign, named after their initials, was launched with the backing of the National Union of Journalists. Elements of the case against them became farcical, with some prosecution witnesses at court hearings identified only by an initial. One of them, \"Colonel B\", was cheerfully outed by campaigners singing, \"Who do you think you are kidding, Colonel Johnstone, when you say you're Colonel B?\" in front of Tottenham magistrates court. Aubrey enjoyed the mischievous side of what turned out to be a long campaign.</p> <p>The trial of the three took place at the Old Bailey in 1978, with Aubrey charged with unauthorised receipt of classified information.</p> <p>The prosecution, chastened by a hostile media and public reaction and the defence's disclosure that much of the supposedly secret information was already in the public domain, dropped in mid-trial the more serious charge under section one of the Official Secrets Act. The three were convicted on a lesser charge, but given non-custodial sentences and the act was severely discredited. The experience led Aubrey to write Who's Watching You? Britain's Security Service and the Officials Secrets Act, published in 1981.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396931052\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/30/1349022650055/Crispin-Aubrey-left-at-Gl-010.jpg\" alt=\"Crispin Aubrey, left, at Glastonbury festival.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crispin Aubrey, left, was a committed anti-nuclear campaigner.

His interest in alternatives of all kinds had also led to him co-authoring the book Here Is the \"Other\" News: Challenges to the Local Commercial Press (1980).</p> <p>From the early 90s, he was involved with the Glastonbury festival as a press officer. With his colleague, John Shearlaw, he edited Glastonbury Festival Tales (2004). Michael Eavis, the founder of the festival, was a great admirer and described him as \"a resolute campaigner for green issues who kept up the pressure on me constantly\".</p> <p>A man of unswerving principle behind a genial and laidback exterior, Aubrey had a sharp sense of humour and a complete lack of self-regard. A generous host \u2013 and famed for dancing until the early hours \u2013 he was often the last man standing at any party.

  "<p>My father-in-law, Alan Carter, who has died aged 87, spent most of his life in Saddleworth. To the end a \"denier\" of border reorganisation, he always saw Saddleworth as part of Yorkshire rather than Greater Manchester.</p> <p>He was born and schooled in north Manchester. The family returned to the Carters' homelands in Saddleworth in his teens. His ancestors had moved there at the end of the 18th century from nearby Marsden. He served in the RAF XI squadron as a Spitfire pilot in Japan (1946-1947) and worked in a foundry and as a clerk on the railways, and then became an education welfare officer for West Riding under Sir Alec Clegg.</p> <p>Reorganisation saw him transfer to Oldham to maintain continuity of involvement with Saddleworth schools. Shortly afterwards, a career change led to him joining a friend who ran a plumbing business. Alan always showed an aptitude for learning new skills \u2013 including plumbing, carpentry, building and flying model planes \u2013 which he developed to a high level.</p> <p>In later life he became a piano tuner. All through his life, music had been important. Learning trombone with Dobcross Band Club, he joined a band in the RAF and played extensively in Japan. He talked with enthusiasm about playing for an event for General Douglas MacArthur in Tokyo. Back in the UK, he played banjo, guitar and double bass in folk dance bands, and double bass in Oldham Symphony Orchestra. Electronic keyboards fascinated him and one of his last performances was to his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren at home to great applause.</p> <p>He was married from 1945 to 1969 to Audrey Buckley, with whom he had two children, my wife, Janet, and her brother, Geoffrey. After Audrey's death from a brain haemorrhage, he married Pat Higginson in 1973, having met through their joint work with children. They had a daughter, Elizabeth, and fostered children for several years. Family was at the core of Alan's world.</p> <p>A gentle man in every way, he had many talents and bore his problems in later life with great patience. Alzheimer's disease for four years, and latterly cancer, could not undermine his welcoming, friendly approach to life. He never forgot the Japanese he learned in the RAF and liked to surprise unsuspecting Japanese tourists with a greeting in their own language.</p> <p>He is survived by Pat, his children, seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.</p>",
  "<p>The challenger to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in the Venezuelan presidential election has vowed a dramatic change in foreign policy if he is elected next Sunday, shifting his country away from China and Russia and reviewing crucial oil deals.</p> <p>Henrique Capriles, who has gained ground in recent polls, said he would halt arms purchases from Russia, rethink relations with Iran and revise deals to exploit one of the world's biggest recoverable oil resources in the Orinoco belt.</p> <p>In an interview during a campaign stop, Capriles said he would end the Ch\u00e1vez policy of promoting worldwide revolution and focus on Venezuela's needs.</p> <p>\"The foreign policy of this government is driven by politics \u2013 to extend a revolution worldwide. My objective with regards to foreign relations is to benefit all Venezuelans,\" he said.</p> <p>This would mark a dramatic change. Under Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela has consistently thumbed its nose at the US and moved closer to Russia, China, Nicaragua, Cuba and Iran. An example of the close friendship with Moscow came this week when Vladimir Putin presented Ch\u00e1vez with a Russian terrier puppy.</p> <p>Capriles did not mention Russian dogs, but said Russian guns would no longer be required. \"We have spent more than $14bn (\u00a38.66bn) on arms purchases from Russia,\" Capriles said. \"I am not going to buy more weapons. I think the policy has been mistaken.\"</p> <p>The big question is what would happen to the oil industry in Venezuela, which vies with Saudi Arabia in claiming the biggest proven oil reserves in the world. Until now Russian and Chinese companies have struck the biggest deals for future exploitation. \"We have to revise every deal. I think they are agreements that are not functioning,\" Capriles said.</p> <p>Capriles has said he will continue to work with Beijing \u2013 because \"everyone deals with China\" \u2013 but he appeared ready to distance Venezuela from Iran. \"How have relations with Iran and Belarus benefited Venezuela? We are interested in countries that have democracies, that respect human rights, that we have an affinity with. What affinity do we have with Iran?\"</p> <p>Capriles is the grandson of Jewish <em>\u00e9migr\u00e9s </em>who escaped the Holocaust. He studied law at the Catholic University in Caracas, and says that if he wins the first thing he will do is pay homage to the Virgin Mary in El Valle on the island of Margarita.</p> <p>The 40-year-old offers a sharp contrast with Ch\u00e1vez, who has been in power for 14&#xa0;years and has had treatment for cancer throughout much of his third term.</p> <p>Capriles, who spent eight months in prison after allegedly trying to break into the Cuban embassy in the days after a 2002 coup attempt against Ch\u00e1vez, describes himself as a political centrist \"who looks to the left\". Critics fear he will roll back social programmes and income redistribution initiated by Chavez.</p> <p>Polls suggest the race may be tight. Some say Capriles may be leading by two points. And as the race draws to a close tensions have risen. On Saturday, two Capriles party leaders were killed by gunmen who, the opposition said, were driving a vehicle with state logos.</p> <p>If the results are close many fear a period of instability. Capriles has said he will win by a wide margin and a transition will be peaceful. \"I believe there will be no violence,\" he said. \"Venezuelans have a deep democratic conviction. If the government hotheads ventured out to stir violence they would encounter the armed forces. I don't believe the armed forces respond to a political party.\"</p>",
  "<p>The economy is in a double-dip recession and the government is fighting a losing battle with the budget deficit. Voters' perception of ministers as a bunch of out-of-touch toffs has been reinforced by Andrew Mitchell's ill-tempered brush with the law. Labour is a comfortable 10 points ahead in the opinion polls and Ed Miliband can look forward to a warm reception when he addresses the party conference on Tuesday. Could life get any better for the opposition?</p> <p>Of course it could. As Neil Kinnock would testify, winning general elections is different from holding mid-term opinion poll leads. Labour will only win if it convinces voters on the economy and, despite the progress made since Ed Balls became shadow chancellor, it still has a lot of work to do.</p> <p>Balls faced three big challenges when he took the job: ridding Labour of the reputation for having landed Britain in an awful mess; making the case that George Osborne's deficit-cutting strategy was a dud; and laying out a programme that would prove Labour could do a better job if it was returned to power.</p> <p>Let's start with the good news. Right from the start, Balls insisted back in 2010 that Osborne was a \"growth denier\", who would drive the economy back into recession with his heavy-handed and ill-timed stringency. The shadow chancellor made this point during the battle for the Labour leadership in the one speech of note during the entire campaign. He has been proved right. The economy has gone backwards and the deficit is getting bigger rather than smaller. Osborne derided Alistair Darling's deficit-reduction plan as a timid little affair but it now looks as if the UK's debt position will be worse in 2015 than it would have been had Gordon Brown remained in Downing Street.</p> <p>The chancellor has some plausible-sounding excuses for why this has happened. He says he inherited a structurally flawed economy (true); that it always takes longer to return to recovery after a severe banking crisis (also true); and that Europe's debt crisis has been the main factor impeding the return to robust growth (much less true). The blunt fact is, however, that in May 2010 he told voters that his plan would work and it hasn't.</p> <p>Game, set and match to Balls, then? Not quite. Osborne certainly looks like a Wimbledon player a couple of breaks of serve down in the final set, but he has not given up hope that the economy will turn the corner over the next year. Third-quarter growth will be worse than it looks on the surface, but falling inflation should ease the squeeze on consumer spending power and there are signs that the Bank of England's funding for lending scheme is leading to a slight rise in the flow of credit to households.</p> <p>There is nothing to suggest that the economy is about to surge forward, but it is possible that a slow recovery in 2013 will provide cash-rich businesses with the incentive to invest over 2014. Osborne would then have the basis for an economic argument at the 2015 election: we inherited a mess and it has been a slog, but we are finally getting there.</p> <p>Balls would counter by saying that Britain could have got there a whole lot quicker had it not been for coalition blunders. Even so, if the backdrop to the 2015 election is an economy growing at 2.5-3% a year, Balls' task becomes a lot more difficult.</p> <p>Firstly, he must deal with the legacy issues from Labour's period in office from 1997-2010. The main criticism of the Blair-Brown governments is that they left office with the budget deficit at a peacetime record of 11% of GDP. This, though, was caused by the collapse of the economy and the failure of UK banks in the worst recession since the interwar years. Had Brown and Darling sought to balance the budget when demand was imploding, the recession would have been far worse.</p> <p>Instead, the really telling criticisms of Labour are that it allowed the City of London to become the Wild West of global finance, that it neglected Britain's crumbling manufacturing base because it was too busy cuddling up to hedge fund dealers, and that it allowed the public finances to deteriorate in the years leading up to before the crash by wrongly believing that the tax receipts from the bubbles in the housing and stock markets were permanent rather than temporary.</p> <p>Memories fade, but has the electorate forgiven and forgotten all that happened under Labour? Probably not, which is why Balls feels he must promise a root-and-branch examination of public spending if Labour wins the election. This makes political sense, because a big plank of the Conservative strategy in 2015 will be to make Labour explain which taxes will rise to pay for spending pledges. That proved an effective campaign weapon in 1992, when it allowed the Conservatives to avoid defeat despite presiding over five years of boom and bust.</p> <p>The second challenge for Balls and Miliband is to show that Labour would make a decent fist of running the economy after 2015. This is not the same as having a five-point plan to kick-start growth; nor will it be achieved by promising to chuck money at every problem.</p> <p>In simplified form, the state of Britain is as follows: the economy is 4% smaller than it was five years ago and the latest quarterly current account deficit was in excess of \u00a320bn. Five million people are on housing waiting lists yet housebuilding is at its lowest since the 1920s. The Libor scandal has illustrated once again that the City is a cesspit. New sources of tax revenue need to be found to meet the demands of a modern welfare state. North Sea oil and gas reserves are running out fast and the Conservative part of the coalition is backtracking on the environment. Labour needs policies for all these areas.</p> <p>Neal Lawson, chairman of the thinktank Compass, noted last week: \"The party has nothing to say on public-sector reform, nothing on welfare reform and nothing on climate change. If they have, then I and everyone else has missed it. Why not a real Green New Deal, a financial transaction tax? Why aren't we pushing harder on a living wage, a German-style <a href=\"http://nachhaltigkeit.kfw.de/EN_Home/Sustainability/Environmental_and_social_impact_assessments/index.jsp\" title=\"KfW\">KfW environmental bank</a>, real separation of the big retail and investment banks, new rules on takeovers, workers on boards, a national carers scheme, taxes on land and wealth, and so much more?\"</p> <p>Miliband went some of the way to meeting these concerns with his pledge to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/29/ed-miliband-british-banks?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">split up banks unless they change the way they operate</a> and put customers first. But the party conference is the start of a crucial few months for Labour. Until now it has been able to think and act like an opposition. To win, it now has to start thinking and acting like a government in waiting.</p>",
  "<p>The crime of James Legg, a Chelsea pensioner who murdered a fellow pensioner more than two centuries ago, might well have been forgotten long ago had he not, unknowingly, participated postmortem in a bizarre scientific experiment.</p> <p>Instead, his story, and a plaster cast of the 73-year-old's corpse flayed to the muscle, will form the centrepiece of an exhibition on medical ethics and practices in bygone London. Legg's immortality in art owes everything to the efforts in 1801 of sculptor Thomas Bank, and artists Benjamin West and Richard Crossway, to demonstrate most depictions of the crucifixion of Christ were anatomically incorrect.</p> <p>Aside from stringing up a live victim, the best possible solution would seem to be to acquire one freshly dead.</p> <p>At the time, as the study and teaching of anatomy became increasingly popular, the only legal source of corpses were those of executed prisoners. Demand, though, far exceeded supply, leading to brisk business in the gruesome trade of bodysnatching, where gangs of what were known as resurrection men stole corpses from the capital's cemeteries to sell to anatomist surgeons.</p> <p>It was not only the surgeons who were interested in the dead bodies. Anatomy classes were also offered at the Royal Academy of Arts, and many artists forged relationships with surgeon-anatomists.</p> <p>So, it was to Joseph Constantine Carpue, a well-known surgeon, that Banks and the artists turned for help.</p> <p>An opportunity presented itself when Carpue was called to the Chelsea hospital after Legg had apparently dispatched one of his fellow pensioners with a gun. He was sentenced to death by hanging, and taken to the gallows.</p> <p>Immediately after the execution, his still-warm body was taken by Carpue and Banks and hung from a cross. After letting it settle into position, it was then flayed to remove all the skin before Banks made a cast of it, which the Royal Academy retains, occasionally lending it to exhibitions.</p> <p>Now the plaster cast is going on display at the <a href=\"http:///www.museumoflondon.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Museum of London</a> as part of the exhibition Doctors, Dissection and Resurrection Men, which opens on 19 October.</p> <p>Jelena Beklavac, curator of Human Osteology at the Museum of London, said: \"It is a privilege to have the James Legg cast on display. Looking at James is an absorbing and poignant experience and I am certain visitors will be struck by his presence in the exhibition. James underlines our continued fascination with all things anatomical.\"</p>",
  "<p>Just after his inauguration, President Barack Obama made a pledge: to cut the nation's $1.3tn deficit in half by the end of his first term. Sunday marks a sobering day for the president and his promise \u2013 the end of another fiscal year with a deficit surpassing $1tn.</p> <p>Despite marginal improvements this is the fourth straight year that the deficit has passed the $1tn mark, adding to a national debt that passed $16tn for the first time this year.</p> <p>Obama inherited an economy in crisis only to find the situation was even worse than it appeared. He also inherited wars and tax cuts that have drained the nation's coffers. But his own decisions, including a massive stimulus programme, as well as those beyond his control, have increased the US's debt by $6tn under his watch. The size of the deficit and Obama's failure to tackle it are likely to be hot topics as the president squares off with Mitt Romney for the first presidential debate on Wednesday.</p> <p>Romney and his vice-presidential pick Paul Ryan have hammered Obama's record on debt. \"When he came into office, there was just over $10tn in debt. Now there's over $16tn in debt. If he were re-elected, I can assure you it will be almost $20tn in debt,\" Romney told voters in Ohio last week. \"And by the way, those debts get passed on to our kids. It's not just bad for the economy; it's not just bad for our job creation; it will \u2026 in my opinion, it is immoral for us to pass on obligations like that to the next generation.\"</p> <p>Romney has said he plans to balance the annual budget in eight to 10 years but has given scant details of exactly how that will be achieved. Obama's most recent budget proposal called for $5.3tn in deficit reduction over the next decade. Again, details are in short supply. The president's budget claims the deficit will be $901bn in 2013, better but still far short of his $650bn promise.</p> <p>For most people it simply doesn't matter, until it does, said Ken Goldstein, economist at The Conference Board in New York. \"Walk into any bar tonight and ask 20 people and I bet not one of them knows what the deficit is or what it means. It's abstract, we don't feel it. Its impact is indirect and it's not immediate.\"</p> <p>All that could change come 31 December \u2013 the fiscal cliff \u2013 when Bush-era tax cuts are set to expire and a draconian round of spending cuts will be implemented unless a political compromise can be reached.</p> <p>The tax hike will increase the tax burden by $380bn while the spending cuts take $100bn out of the economy. The cuts to defence and social programmes were agreed in order to force a compromise between Democrats and Republicans on a plan to reduce the deficit. But a \"super commitee\" set up to find a third way failed leaving the cuts in place.</p> <p>Goldstein said the fiscal cliff could make the abstract concrete as taxpayers absorb another knock to their finances and the swingeing cuts strike at a national and local level.</p> <p>\"Consumers and businesses are already dealing with three plus years of austerity. We would be piling austerity on austerity,\" he said. The congressional budget office has warned that failure to tackle the fiscal cliff would cause a \"significant recession\" and the loss of some 2m jobs.</p> <p>\"This will not be easy,\" Obama said as he made his pledge to cut the debt in half. \"It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay \u2013 and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control.\"</p> <p>Four years later that sense of urgency is growing, and so is America's debt.</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Georgians are preparing for the most important election since the rose revolution swept the old order from power almost a decade ago, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/mikheilsaakashvili\" title=\"\">Mikheil Saakashvili</a>, the hero of that hour, facing a very real challenge to his authority.</p> <p>Before parliamentary elections on Monday, the mood in Georgia is tense and febrile. The poll is bitterly contested. This small mountain nation in the southern Caucasus \u2013 on the doorstep of mighty Russia \u2013 is now more polarised than at any time since 1991 and independence from the Soviet Union. At stake is whether Georgia, population 4.7 million, moves towards genuine democracy, or whether the rose revolution that swept Saakashvili to power in 2003 fizzles out.</p> <p>The country is also at the heart of a strategic battle between Moscow and the west. Russia insists Georgia is part of its backyard. To prove a point, it invaded in 2008 after Saakashvili unwisely tried to grab back rebel South Ossetia. Washington and the EU say Georgia is a sovereign nation that can decide its own destiny. Two geopolitical visions \u2013 Atlanticist and neo-Soviet \u2013 collide here in a landscape of ancient villages and the breathtaking Caucasus mountains.</p> <p>Until recently Saakashvili and his ruling United National Movement party had been expected to cruise to victory. All this changed after the release by two opposition TV stations 12 days ago of a horrific video showing prison officers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/19/georgia-prison-guards-torture-video\" title=\"\">abusing inmates and sodomising them with broom handles</a>. \"When I watched it I thought it was a nightmare. The images were just awful,\" said Khatuna Kipiani, an opposition supporter in the capital, Tbilisi.</p> <p>The video revealed something rotten at the heart of Georgia's state. It has appalled Georgian voters, embarrassed the authorities, and led to a surge of support for Georgia's opposition and its leader <a href=\"http://www.rferl.org/content/bidzina-ivanishivili-georgia-wild-card-elections/24724299.html\" title=\"\">Bidzina Ivanishvili</a>, whose $6.4bn (\u00a34bn) fortune is put at half of Georgia's GDP. He burst on to the political scene last year, following years of quiet philanthropy in which he had paid for police uniforms, restored crumbling churches and gave salaries to actors and struggling artists, a sort of Georgian fairy godmother.</p> <p>His <a href=\"http://www.georgiandream.ge/eng,georgian-dream-coalition\" title=\"\">Georgian Dream coalition</a>, named after a song by his rapper son, lags behind Saakashvili's ruling party in the ratings. But it is catching up, according to the latest polls.</p> <p>On Saturday evening, 100,000 Georgian Dream supporters packed into Tbilisi's main Rustaveli Avenue. \"It is as clear as day \u2013 we will win and achieve another victory in the history of our nation,\" Ivanishvili told them. \"We will not let anyone separate us from civilisation, modern times and democracy.\"</p> <p>His rise has spooked the government. It has variously dismissed him as a Kremlin stooge, a political dilettante, a \"weirdo\", and an old-style paternalist. Government aides point out that he keeps a zoo at his home in western Georgia, with his penguins housed in a special refrigerator. They also say his sprawling coalition includes unsavoury elements, such as xenophobes and fans of Stalin, who was born in the Georgian town of Gori. But, undoubtedly, Ivanishvili has plugged into a mood of popular discontent and fatigue with Saakashvili, who critics say has become increasingly dictatorial.</p> <p>Some thousands of observers have flooded into Georgia for Monday's poll. Lobbyists hired by Ivanishvili have bombarded members of the US |Congress and other opinion-makers with emails promoting Georgian Dream and accusing Saakashvili of treachery. The government has hit back: all international visitors to Georgia, a land of ancient viniculture, receive a free bottle of Saperavi wine from passport control. The government says Ivanishvili is using his money, made in Russia in the 1990s, to buy the election.</p> <p>In a report on Saturday, Transparency International, which describes itself as an anti-corruption organisation, blamed both sides for presenting \"simplistic programmes\" for increased social spending.</p> <p>For many voters, it is poverty and unemployment that have driven them to support Georgia's opposition. Sitting in a Tbilisi park on a warm evening \u2013 next to a statue of Giorgi Leonidze, a Georgian poet \u2013 Manana Nizharadze said she was surviving on a state pension of just 100 lari (\u00a337) a month.</p> <p>\"We live very badly. Wages are low. Communal charges are high. We can't afford medicines,\" she said. \"Saakashvili is a bad person.\"</p> <p>Edward Saakashvili \u2013 a distant relative of the president \u2013 demurred. \"He's done good things. People don't like discipline,\" he said, tossing back a glass of schnapps.</p> <p>Many voters complain of the president's disastrous 2008 war with Russia. Both South Ossetia and Abkhazia \u2013 which broke away in the 1990s \u2013 are now home to a massive Russian military presence. Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, who famously described how he wanted to \"hang Saakashvili by the balls\", conducted military exercises there last week, a crude reminder to Tbilisi that Moscow could re-invade any time. \"Shevadnadze lost the whole of Abkahzia. Misha [Saakashvili] lost Ossetia. It was a big mistake,\" said Nizharadze.</p> <p>Saakashvili's own future is unclear. He is 44 and due to step down as president in January 2013. His government has enacted constitutional changes that will transform Georgia next year from a presidential to a parliamentary republic. This has fuelled speculation that Saakashvili is planning to \"do a Putin\", and perform a job swap that would see him hang on to executive power by becoming prime minister.</p> <p>His government colleagues, however, are sceptical of such a manoeuvre. \"Politically it's impossible,\" said Giga Bokeria, secretary of Georgia's national security council.</p>",
  "<p>In his gently astonishing new film, Life of Pi, adapted from Yann Martel's 2001 bestseller, director Ang Lee melds so many disparate elements \u2013 Aesopian fable and cutting-edge 3D technology, east and west, young and old \u2013 that he may have just succeeded in rebranding himself as the Obama of world cinema. The fiercely urgent candidate of 2008, of course, not the stealth version currently working the stump.</p> <p>The sheer number of world religions given a shout-out in the film \u2013 Hindu, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist \u2013 is enough to send Donald Trump's comb-over scampering up the nearest tree trunk, looking for cover.</p> <p>The film takes a while to get going, like someone roused from their morning meditation, with lots of flowers and candles and people wearing kindly, fixed smiles suggesting enlightenment, or as if they had been hit around the head with a brass pot.</p> <p>In French India, the young son of a zoo owner collects world religions the way other kids collect stamps. \"They were my superheroes,\" he says, checking off a list of deities. Such good karma, sad to say, doesn't necessarily make for good drama.

Immersing himself in the latest technology \u2014 3D, digital paintboxes, motion capture and control \u2013 as Martin Scorsese did in last year's Hugo, Lee summons delights with his fingertips. But where Hugo was cold to the touch, Life of Pi feels warm-blooded, the perfect summation of the principle powering Lee's entire career: still waters run deep. You see it both in the Zen minimalism of his compositions \u2013 check out the shots of sky reflected in a glassy ocean, the boat suspended in the middle as if hanging in thin air \u2013 and the sonar-like skill with which he sounds out the emotional depths of Martel's tale. Lee's pixels are animated by empathy.</p> <p>Life of Pi feels so simple, yet knotted with resonance, that you wonder why Lee bothered with the framing narrative in which a grown-up Pi chews over the spiritual implications of his tale with a writer in Toronto. For one thing, the argument they come up with for the existence of God turns out to bear a suspicious similarity to an argument for the all-round grooviness of magic realism. For another: Toronto. A nice city, but its neat patches of parkland and grey high-rises are no match for breaching whales, phosphorescent fish and crouching tigers, or the sight if Pi, howling like Job into stormy skies.</p> <p>Hollywood has been waiting for this movie.

  "<p>Malcolm Wicks, who has died aged 65 after suffering from cancer, was sent to the House of Commons as the new Labour MP for Croydon North West in April 1992. As the polls closed at 10pm on election night, he was hurrying out of the party's committee rooms in Thornton Heath when he saw \"a dishevelled gentleman\" going through a litter bin. Even at such a significant juncture in his own life, Wicks paused to ask himself what parliament had to offer such a citizen. A few days later, shortly before arriving at the Palace of Westminster, Wicks encountered another such elderly unfortunate in Victoria Street, a man who told the new MP that he had been in a mental institution for 35&#xa0;years but was now \"in the care of the&#xa0;community\".</p> <p>In his maiden speech, Wicks, at the time an academic whose life's work had been dedicated to the improvement of social policy, recounted these episodes. As a new MP, he said, he saw his challenge as being to \"bridge the gap between the pomp and circumstance of parliament and the poverty and pain in many of our communities\". He&#xa0;remained committed to this endeavour for the rest of his life.</p> <p>Wicks, who captured his seat from the Conservatives, was a highly regarded minister in the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown from 1999 to 2008: in the Department for Education and Employment, where he was minister for lifelong learning, until 2001; at Work and Pensions, where he was minister of state until 2003 and minister for pensions until 2005; and at&#xa0;Trade and Industry, where he became minister for energy, and subsequently at&#xa0;the renamed Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, where he held the same post.</p> <p>He dedicated his political life to finding ways to relieve poverty and insecurity through both education and&#xa0;support of the family, while always&#xa0;recognising that the fabric and structure of people's lives were constantly changing.</p> <p>Wicks's interests were the subjects that affected people's lives: childcare, single parenthood, marriage breakdown, child support, benefits and caring for the elderly. But he also had an eye on the big picture, especially on the inequities of an education system in which social background had more impact than individual merit. His most significant parliamentary achievements were promoting a private member's bill to help people who look after family members, which was adopted by the Conservative government and passed into law as the Carers Act 1995, and securing the passage of the Learning and Skills Act 2000, establishing the Connexions strategy to help school-leavers into work.</p> <p>The wellsprings of Wicks's political beliefs were his father, Arthur, and his mother, Daisy. The family lived in Islington, north London, when it was a poor area, and ran two shops and a cafe. Arthur was a passionate socialist and pacifist, his own father having been killed at Flanders when he was two years old. He became chairman of housing on Shoreditch borough council in the 1950s and was the last chairman of the London county council and, later, of its successor the Greater London council. He imbued in his son a belief in public services for education, housing, planning and the arts, and in the need for individuals to contribute their own time and effort to public service.</p> <p>Malcolm took the academic route \u2013 his father had left school at 14 \u2013 and having done poorly in his O-levels, discovered the possibilities of education when he took A-levels at the North West London Polytechnic (now London Metropolitan University). He&#xa0;graduated from the London School of Economics with a BSc in sociology and taught at York University, the Centre for Environmental Studies and Brunel University, before joining the Urban Deprivation Unit at the Home Office. He lectured in social policy at the Civil Service College, was research director of the Study Commission on the Family (1978-83) and was director of the Family Policy Studies Centre from then until his election to Westminster. He published works on many subjects, including hypothermia, urban policy, the welfare state and family change.</p> <p>After supporting Tony Blair in the leadership election in 1994, Wicks was disappointed not to get a ministerial post in 1997. He attributed this to his \"old\" Labour belief in universal benefit and had to wait a year before taking the chairmanship of the education and&#xa0;employment select committee&#xa0;and eventually being made a minister in 1999. In 2008, he stood down from government on being appointed Gordon Brown's special representative on international energy issues, with a privy counsellorship as compensation.</p> <p>One interest he pursued outside domestic political concerns was a passionate defence of the plight of Bosnian Muslims during the civil war in former Yugoslavia. His demand for western military intervention in Bosnia led his then elderly father to call his constituency office and ask to speak to&#xa0;\"the minister for war\", a story Wicks happily told against himself.</p> <p>He was a courteous, humorous and self-deprecating man, equally able to argue and to listen. He joined the Labour party aged 19, contested Croydon North West unsuccessfully in 1987, won the seat at the following election and from 1997 represented the redrawn constituency of Croydon North. The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, called him \"a wise confidant and most importantly a dear friend\".</p> <p>Wicks married Margaret (nee Baron), a scientist, in 1968. She survives him, as&#xa0;do their son and two daughters.</p> <p>\u2022 Malcolm Hunt Wicks, politician and academic, born 1 July 1947; died 29 September 2012</p>",
  "<p>As the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/30/edmiliband-labour-conference-2012\" title=\"\">Labour party meets this weekend</a>, its leadership will come under pressure from the trade union movement to show that it has something to offer in place of the coalition's disastrous austerity programme. The TUC is gearing up to march for \"A Future that Works\" in the immediate wake of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tuc\" title=\"\">congress that called for the nationalisation of much of Britain's banking sector</a>. The unions will be demanding something more than \"cuts with a human face\". There is talk of the need for an alternative economic strategy. Not before time.</p> <p>It's not just that we need a growth strategy to replace the coalition's scorched earth austerity policies. There are far deeper problems with the UK economy that explain how we got here and that must be tackled by any future Labour government.</p> <p>The financialisation of the global economy over the last 30 years had a particularly profound effect in Britain as a consequence of the historic economic and political power of the City of London. The period following the big bang in the 1980s left our economy weak and almost uniquely dependent on a bloated financial sector. As a result, manufacturing now accounts for a mere 14% of GDP. Britain's bank debt is higher than the US, Germany or France, equivalent to 460% of GDP, and its economy lags far behind these countries in recovering from the effects of the crash in 2007.</p> <p>To compound this, the financial sector has changed the way companies behave. Its insistence that capital should follow short-term shareholder value has impeded investment in industrial modernisation through research and development. Meanwhile, the City has extended its grip over large areas of social life. The housing market thrives on failing to supply enough affordable homes and City firms and private equity funds siphon off taxpayers money by milking lucrative public service contracts and trading in PFI debt.</p> <p>Reversing this legacy will mean decisively breaking with the neoliberal economic assumptions that led Labour to espouse the efficiency of markets, right up to the moment where they spectacularly failed in 2007. It will mean embracing a comprehensive set of policies aimed at winning control of investment and breaking the grip of the City over political and economic life.</p> <p>Many of these proposals are already widely current on the left, in the labour movement and beyond: public ownership of much of the financial sector, investment in a massive programme of house building to create jobs and kickstart growth; long-term investment in new green industries; new model public services.</p> <p>But these policies cannot be cherry-picked. Instead, they must form part of a coherent strategy aimed at achieving sustainable growth, narrowing inequality, breaking the grip of the City and effecting long-term change through the strategic use of social ownership. The monetarists and neoliberals on the right in the 1980s understood the importance of ownership when they busied themselves introducing a succession of world economies to the doctrines of shock therapy. Now the left must learn the same lesson in reverse.</p> <p>Ownership matters because with it comes democratic control. Labour must be prepared to fully nationalise part of the banking sector, create a democratically controlled investment bank, take public stakes in new companies in strategically important green industries or create new mutuals to enable long-term investment and planned growth. It must be prepared to build socially owned houses again and to regain public control of public services on a newly democratised basis.</p> <p>None of this will go down well with New Labour's votaries at <a href=\"http://www.progressonline.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Progress</a>. It will play even less well with their friends in the City. Nonetheless, it remains the case that if a progressive government ever really wants to get Britain working again, it must confront the immovable object in the Square Mile with the irresistible force of social ownership.</p>",
  "<p>Al-Jazeera's editorial independence has been called into question after its director of news stepped in to ensure a speech made by Qatar's emir to the UN led its English channel's coverage of the debate on Syrian intervention.</p> <p>Journalists had produced a package of the UN debate, topped with excerpts of President Obama's speech, last Tuesday when a last-minute instruction came from Salah Negm, the Qatar-based news director, who ordered the video to be re-edited to lead with the comments from Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani.</p> <p>Despite protests from staff that the emir's comments \u2013 a repetition of previous calls for Arab intervention in Syria \u2013 were not the most important aspect of the UN debate, the two-minute video was re-edited and Obama's speech was relegated to the end of the package.</p> <p>There are hints at staff dissatisfaction within the film, available for viewing on <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2012/09/201292645421649378.html\" title=\"\">al-Jazeera's website</a> and YouTube, which notes that the emir \"represents one of the smallest countries in the Arab world&#xa0;\u2026 but Qatar has been one of the loudest voices condemning Syria\".</p> <p>The episode left a bitter taste among staff amid complaints that this was the most heavy-handed editorial intervention at the global broadcaster, which has long described itself as operating independent of its Qatari ownership.</p> <p>An al-Jazeera spokesman said the emir's speech was \"a significant development\" that day and the broadcaster \"consequently gave it prominence\".</p> <p>Obama's speech had been carried live, the spokesman added, and the emir's comments were balanced with disagreement from the Egyptian president, Mohammed Morsi.</p> <p>However, insiders said Morsi's contribution had to be taken from an interview with another broadcaster, because none of the world leaders speaking at the UN had, or was, intending to take notice of the emir's comments.</p> <p>Al-Jazeera English was set up in 2006 by the Arabic broadcaster of the same name and both are owned by the Qatari state. The network, founded in 1996, gained credibility with audiences in the region for its seemingly independent coverage in the post 9/11 period. Its English channel was launched to offer an alternative, non-western-centric worldview.</p> <p>However, in recent years, Qatar has taken steps to consolidate its control over the channel as the country seeks greater political influence in the Gulf.</p> <p>In September 2011, Wadah Khanfar, a Palestinian widely seen as independent, suddenly left as director-general after eight years in the post and was replaced by a member of the royal family, Sheikh Ahmed bin Jassim al-Thani, a man with no background in journalism.</p> <p>In his resignation letter, Khanfar said, after noting that the channel had been criticised by Donald Rumsfeld and hailed by Hillary Clinton, that \"al-Jazeera is still independent and its integral coverage has not changed\".</p> <p>He added: \"When we launched in 1996, media independence was a contradiction in terms\", but al-Jazeera had managed \"to pleasantly surprise\" its critics by \"exceeding all expectations\".</p>",
  "<p>Ed Miliband has indicated that a threat by banks to move abroad would not deter him from breaking them up if they did not agree to revolutionise their operations and put ordinary customers first.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/29/ed-miliband-banks-gurus-coalitions\" title=\"\">interview with the Observer</a>, the Labour leader says he will confront the City of London with what is seen as the nuclear option for reform if the banks fail to separate their \"casino\" investment operations from services to account holders, savers and businesses.</p> <p>Critics of such a policy argue it would lead the banks to abandon the UK as their base.</p> <p>The Labour leader told BBC1's Andrew Marr show he did not believe that would happen but said that, if it did, he was ready to face them down.</p> <p>\"I think what the British people want is a prime minister that will do the right thing for the country,\" he said. \"Do you want somebody who will stand up to the powerful vested interests in our country or not? And I think if that's the test of the election between myself and David Cameron, I think people will understand that I can answer that question better than he can.\"</p> <p>In terms that will anger the investment banking industry, Miliband tells the Observer a Labour government, as one of its first acts, would push through a modern-day equivalent of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which split the commercial and investment operations of US banks after the 1929 stock market crash.</p> <p>The move is part of an attempt by the Labour leader to flesh out his promise to deliver a more \"responsible capitalism\", amid signs the British public does not yet believe he is tough enough, nor has a sufficiently clear vision, to be prime minister.</p> <p>Speaking ahead of Labour's annual conference, which opens in Manchester on Sunday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/29/ed-miliband-british-banks\" title=\"\">Miliband says banks must concentrate on core functions</a> such as lending to small businesses \"rather than playing the international money markets\". Such behaviour puts ordinary customers at risk of having to share the consequences of failed investments.</p> <p>Echoing concerns expressed last month by Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, who believes that reforms proposed last year by Sir John Vickers are being \"watered down\" after lobbying by the banks, Miliband says it is time to stop backsliding, and to change banking culture for good. The recent Libor scandal involving the fiddling of inter-bank interest rates and the \u00a310bn scandal over mis-selling of payment protection insurance showed the culture was still rotten.</p> <p>Miliband says: \"Either they can do it themselves \u2013 which frankly is not what has happened over the past year \u2013 or the next Labour government will, by law, break up retail and investment banks.</p> <p>\"The banks and the government can change direction and say they are going to implement the spirit and principle of Vickers to the full. That means the hard ringfence between retail and investment banking. We need real separation, real culture change. Or we will legislate.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ed Miliband has hit back at a senior union leader by defending Labour's commitment to a public sector pay freeze and insisting the party is not in thrall to \"sectional interests\".</p> <p>Len McCluskey, general secretary of Britain's biggest union, Unite, used <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/Politics/article1137143.ece\" title=\"\">an eve-of-conference interview with the Sunday Times</a> to describe the party's support for the pay freeze as \"crazy\" and urged Miliband to reject the influence of Blairites.</p> <p>But in a strongly worded retort, the Labour leader said the party had a choice of either supporting pay rises or protecting jobs. \"[McCluskey] is entitled to his view but he is wrong,\" Miliband told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday. \"We've got the right policy to say we put jobs in the public sector ahead of pay rises. That's what we said we would do this parliament. It is a difficult decision but it is the way to keep jobs in the public sector.</p> <p>\"But there is a bigger message also about the Labour party that I lead \u2013 I am not for pushing people out of the Labour party. I want more people in the Labour party. There is no future for this party as the party of one sectional interest of society. We must be the party of the private sector just as much as the party of the public sector,\" he said.</p> <p>Miliband, who defeated his brother David to become Labour leader with the help of union support, said McCluskey's criticism was proof the unions were not \"pulling our strings\".</p> <p>At the same time, Miliband attempted to put distance between Labour and the coalition in other areas, including the rate at which they would cut the deficit, the top rate of income tax \u2013 which he said Labour would put back to 50p in the pound \u2013 and the breakup of banks.</p> <p>The Labour leader also said his party would repeal the NHS bill, just a day after he reportedly said it would not be sensible \"for us to come along and say \u2026 we're just going to reverse it all back and spend another \u00a33bn on another top-down bureaucratic organisation\".</p> <p>On Saturday night, the Conservatives had accused Miliband of losing control of NHS policy, saying that moments after the Labour leader's comments the shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, had said he would \"repeal the bill, full stop\". Miliband told Marr: \"We're going to repeal the bill, we are going to make those changes, but we obviously have to look at some of the detail of some of the reforms, some of the changes that have been made, because I don't want to just shuffle the deckchairs all over the place again.\"</p> <p>On banking, Miliband followed up <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/29/ed-miliband-british-banks\" title=\"\">his interview with the Observer</a> \u2013 in which he said he would break up Britain's banks unless they separated their \"casino\" investment operations from services to accountholders, savers and businesses \u2013 by implying that a threat by the banks to move abroad would not dissuade him from implementing such a policy. \"Do you want someone who will stand up to the vested interests of our society or don't you?\" he said.</p> <p>The Labour leader claimed he was unconcerned about opinion polls showing his personal ratings were low. Miliband said the fact the Tories had released a poll on him showed \"I've got them worried\".</p> <p>He added: \"I am my own person and I am going to do it my way. I think, in the end, people respect somebody who has seriousness of purpose and a clarity of ideas. Let me just make this contrast. Four years ago David Cameron was saying, 'I want to hug a hoodie and I want to hug a husky.' And now he wants to lock up the hoodies and doesn't give a damn about huskies \u2026 People don't quite know where he stands. People are always going to know where I stand.\"</p>",
  "<p>I always wanted to be a teacher. When I was little I wanted to be primary school teacher. My parents tell me they used to laugh so much at me telling off my imaginary students. Then when I got to secondary school and started to study drama I knew this was the subject I wanted to teach. So it was all planned from the beginning. I had a really inspiring and amusing drama teacher called Peter Rowlands. He lived in Hebden Bridge but came from New Zealand. Peter had trained to teach at <a href=\"http://www.cssd.ac.uk/\">Central School of Speech and Drama</a> so after my drama degree at the <a href=\"http://www.uclan.ac.uk/\">University of Central Lancashire</a> in Preston, I also went to Central to train as a teacher. Peter had a significant affect on me and lots of other students in our A-level class. Almost all them ended up doing something drama related.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.deptfordgreen.lewisham.sch.uk\">Deptford Green School</a> in south east London was my training school, where I spent the first two terms of my teaching qualification. It was a big change coming to London from the small town of Pontefract in West Yorkshire, where I'm from. I'd been to college but that was just a short drive home. This was London. I was nervous; it was the other end of the country. So, it was a real relief to find a school where it was just so lovely and friendly. As soon as I arrived I knew I wanted to stay. I just felt really quickly it was the school I'd have loved to have gone to as a student \u2013 and I think I'd have done much better if I'd been a student here. Despite it being a large inner city school, everyone knew each other. It was warm and friendly. There were really special relationships between students and teachers as well as between teachers.</p> <p>I've realised that you can enjoy teaching in what could be seen as a tough environment if you've got supportive staff. This was an ethos that had been created at the school over a long time. In the past 11 years since I've taught here, a lot of people have left and new teachers have arrived, including a new head five years ago, but that ethos has stayed.</p> <p>We've been a training school for a very long time and a lot of students train in our school and then get a job here as I did. We are no longer technically a training school as the criteria has changed but still take a lot of trainees particularly from <a href=\"http://www.gold.ac.uk/educational-studies/\">Goldsmiths</a> which is just across the road from us, and also the <a href=\"http://www.ioe.ac.uk/\">Institute of Education</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cssd.ac.uk/\">Central</a>. The interesting thing about trainees is they aren't jaded and have lots of ideas. We are all learners, that's our motto at school for teachers as well as students. We're open to taking new ideas and we have been pioneers for citizenship education.</p> <p>Teaching is of course far more complicated than I'd imagined when I decided to be a teacher as a child. Of course I didn't think of all the ins and outs of the way you need to plan and the behaviour management tricks (and there are lots of tricks; when you start you assume if you tell someone off they'll behave, but that's not necessarily the case). And for a drama teacher, and any teacher now, there are no blackboards, which is disappointing.</p> <p>The most amazing thing about teaching is the children. Whether you are doing an assembly or passing a student in the canteen, you'll get a look or smile from someone you've built a relationship with. They are very funny, and I don't mean I'm laughing at them, I mean they are amusing. That's definitely the big draw of teaching for me. I love it in spite of the politics, Ofsted and all the bad stuff. Working with young people makes it worthwhile. Seeing them start school when they are 11 and their bag is five times bigger than they are, then when they are young men and women ready for the next chapter in their lives. This is the first year of our new sixth form at Deptford Green which adds another whole dimension and it's going to be amazing to see our students grow up even more.</p> <p>I started out as a drama teacher and I still teach nine drama lessons a week. Putting on productions is voluntary, but of course it's an expectation of drama and PE teachers that you will run extra curricular stuff and a big part of the job. You put in a lot of extra time but it all pays off. It's so enjoyable and means you have an impact on and know many more students than you actually teach. When you work with students on a show, they are coming in their own time so a very different relationship develops.</p> <p>Now I'm leader of learning at school, so very involved in curriculum development, and one of the assistant heads - so it's not all about drama for me anymore. I play a game of two halves. It's a big change from being a class teacher. There are times when you're having to be really firm with people. When you become part of the senior management your relationships with students and even colleagues will change over time. But students seem good at knowing when you're doing drama and when you're in your other role. I think having a background in drama teaching can really help in a leadership role, in fact our head teacher also used to be a drama teacher. As a drama teacher you have to have a lot of empathy and understand people. The leadership of other adults, getting them on board and encouraging them to up with ideas, all these are skills you develop in drama and theatre - putting on a show is of course the ultimate in team work.</p> <p>I feel I've been really lucky in my career. I've had leadership that has seen what I can do and given me the opportunities to develop, I really enjoy the leadership role and I suppose that's what's made me stay at the school for so long. My role keeps changing so it keeps me interested, keeps me learning.</p> <p>As of this term we have a wonderful new school building, one of the last built under the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/jul/05/buried-report-labour-school-building\">Buildings Schools for the Future</a> programme. We badly needed this new school building and being in it has really lifted our spirits. Everything is brighter and cleaner and it feels like a new chapter for the school.</p> <p>My advice to those in training or just starting their teaching career is:</p> <p>\u2022 Try to stay calm and not panic. It's hard. Sometimes it's worth pretending you're calm even if you're not, it can make you feel calmer. If students see you are flapping and running about they'll pick up on it.<br>\u2022 Be organised. It's a tough first few years you've got to keep on top of things.<br>\u2022 Get involved in the life of the school. <br>\u2022 Make allies, you need fellow teachers as your friends.</p> <p>It can be difficult to work out if a school is the right one for you to work in. Visit, take a long look at the website (remember it's marketing but you should be able to get some feel for what the school do). Results are part of it, but not the whole story. If you get a job in a school that ends up not feeling right for you, don't be afraid to go and get another job.</p> <p><em>Ian Paish is assistant headteacher and leader of teaching at <a href=\"http://www.deptfordgreen.lewisham.sch.uk\">Deptford Green School</a> in south east London.</em></p> <p>Ian's favourite resource: <a href=\"http://teachers.guardian.co.uk/teacher-resources/10818/?INTCMP=NECJOBBTN767I2\">Bullying for year 7 tutors</a>.
