An earlier \"person of interest\" who was said to have appeared at the scene has been identified and ruled out of the inquiry. </p> <p>The Oak Creek police chief, John Edwards, said it is premature to ascribe a motive, but some in the Sikh community said they feared Page confused them for Muslims. Witnesses to the shooting described him as wearing a tattoo commemorating 9/11. Photographs also show him posing in front of a Nazi flag.</p> <p>\"Maybe he hated our community for the wrong reasons,\" Amrit Dhaliwal, a local doctor and member of the Oak Creek temple, told the Guardian. \"He may have thought putting a turban on was something else. We want to know: why did it happen?\"</p> <p>In the days following the 9/11 attacks, there were four attacks on Sikhs in the Milwaukee area.</p> <p>\"It's pretty much a hate crime,\" Ven Boba Ri, one of the temple's committee members, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \"It's sad \u2013 I don't know how to describe it. Sikhism is such a peaceful religion. We have suffered for generations, in India and even here.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.splcenter.org/\">Southern Poverty Law Center,</a> which monitors extremist groups, suggested the community might have been targeted by Page because of a broader prejudice as it described him as a \"frustrated neo-Nazi who had been the leader of a racist white-power band\" called End Apathy.</p> <p>Witnesses said Page \"did not speak \u2013 he just began shooting\". Using a semi-automatic pistol, he fired shots in rapid succession. He was carrying several magazines of bullets. Some of the congregants hid in cupboards. Children cowered downstairs and several women barricaded themselves in the building's kitchen. The victims included an 84-year-old man and a 41-year-old woman. Four of the dead were found inside the temple and three outside.</p> <p>Among the dead was the temple president, Satwant Kaleka, who arrived in the US in 1982 largely penniless and built a successful petrol-station business. His son, Amardeep, said Kaleka, 65, was shot twice after tackling Page and then hid in a room where he died.</p> <p>Kaleka was a founder of the temple, which opened five years ago to accommodate the area's expanding Sikh community. \"It was like a second home to him,\" said Amardeep Kaleka. \"He was the kind of person who, if he got a call that a bulb was out at 2am he'd go over to change it.\"</p> <p>Two custodians, or granthi, were also killed, including Parkash Singh, who recently brought his wife and children from India to live in Wisconsin. Another victim who was hit stumbled to a nearby house, where Jim Haase opened the door to find an elderly man covered in blood from a bullet wound. \"He couldn't speak English but he was pointing at it [the wound],\" Haase told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinal.</p> <p>Haase, a former soldier, laid the man on his lawn and pressed a towel on the wound to stem the bleeding.</p> <p>The four men killed were named as Bhai Seeta Singh, 41; Bhai Parkash Singh, 49; Bhai Ranjit Singh, 39; Subegh Singh, 84. The dead woman was identified as Parmjit Kaur Toor, 41.</p> <p>Of the six victims, four were Indian nationals, the country's ambassador to the US, Nirupama Rao, was told by the FBI.</p> <p>The police officer wounded by Page was named as Lieutenant Brian Murphy, 51. Murphy was ambushed by the shooter as he went to tend to a wounded person. He was shot eight or nine times at close range. Edmonds commended his heroism as it emerged that he urged colleagues to help others, despite being seriously injured himself.</p> <p>Steve Saffidi, the mayor of Oak Creek, said that what he called the \"heroic action of the police\" prevented many more people being killed. </p> <p>Kuldip Singh, president of US chapter of United Sikhs, an international non-profit organisation, who has spent the past day in Oak Creek, said there was to find and send trauma counselors, preferably Sikhs, who could speak to a community grappling with fear and insecurity. Singh said: \"The wife of a victim was so shattered \u2013 she had seen her husband in a pool of blood and could not even speak. I met others who are too scared to say anything, too scared to go out of their homes. People in the community are asking, 'Why did this happen, why us?'\"</p> <p>Singh also named two people at the temple on Sunday morning, Punjab Singh and Santokh Singh, as being among those critically injured and receiving medical treatment. \"Punjab Singh had arrived not very long ago from Amritsar, India. He would do the discourses at the gurudwara,\" Singh said.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, US secretary of state Hillary Clinton spoke to India's external affairs minister S M Krishna and expressed her shock and sadness over the killings. The Indian embassy's spokesperson in Washington, Virander Paul, told The Guardian that officials from the Indian consulate in Chicago had visited the community, were working with US authorities, and would extend consular assistance to the affected families.</p> <h2>'Soul searching'</h2> <p>In Oak Creek, police said Page bought the weapon and bullets legally, and there was no bar to him owning a gun. But the shooting again raises question about the ease with which powerful guns can be purchased in the US, questions that were sidestepped after James Holmes shot dead 12 people and wounded 58 others in a Denver suburb last month. Holmes was carrying several semi-automatic weapons.</p> <p>Another man responsible for a mass killing, Jared Loughner, who shot dead six people including a nine-year-old girl in a failed attempt to assassinate an Arizona congresswoman, Gabrielle Giffords, last year is expected to plead guilty on Tuesday after reaching a deal with prosecutors that will save him from the execution chamber.</p> <p>Speaking at a bill-signing ceremony in Washington, Obama said: \"All of us recognise that these kinds of terrible, tragic events are happening with too much regularity.\" He said elected officials and community leaders must come together to discuss what should be done.</p> <p>The president said federal authorities had not yet determined what motivated the gunman but that if it turned out to be the \"ethnicity of those who were attending the temple, I think the American people immediately recoil against those kinds of attitudes\".</p> <p>The Sikh Coalition, a group set up after 9/11 as a response to hate crimes and bias against Sikhs, said it had partnered with other Milwaukee organizations to set up an <a href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/Milwaukee-Sikh\">assistance fund</a>. Contributions made to it would be used to to extend financial assistance towards victims of the shooting, including the injured police office. Satjeet Kaur, a coalition representative, told the Guardian: \"The fund has collected over $30,000 already. People from across different communities have reached out in support, saying they want to help.\"</p> <p>The coalition's executive director, Sapreet Kaur, also issued a statement on the shootings. \"While we continue to be cautious about rushing to judgment, it is important to note that this is only one of a growing number of incidents of violence that Sikhs have experienced in recent years. Freedom of religion is a fundamental tenet of democracy and it's incredibly sad that victims were shot down while exercising that right in the peace of their gurdwara [place of worship].\"</p>",
  "<p>Standard Chartered bank ran a rogue unit that schemed with Iran's government to hide more than $250bn (\u00a3160bn) in illegal transactions for nearly a decade, according to a scathing report by New York regulators that may put intense pressure on the management of the UK-based bank.</p> <p>According to the report filed by the New York state department of financial services (NYSDFS), when warned by a US colleague about dealings with Iran, a Standard Chartered executive caustically replied: \"You f---ing Americans. Who are you to tell us, the rest of the world, that we're not going to deal with Iranians.\" </p> <p>About 60,000 transactions were involved between 2001 and 2007 and the bank faces losing its ability to trade in the US if the allegations are proven. <br>The regulator has demanded a meeting with the bank on 15 August and just hours before trading began in its shares in Hong Kong this morning the bank insisted it \"strongly rejects the position or the portrayal of facts as set out\".</p> <p>Shares in the British bank dropped sharply in the final seconds of trading; the accusations were published just as the London stock market was closing. The shares slumped 6% to \u00a314.70 to become the biggest faller in the FTSE 100.</p> <p>The attack on Standard Chartered \u2013 which is accused by the US of \"wilful and egregious violations of law\" \u2013 could be a severe blow to the reputation of the bank which, until last night, had been regarded as the most solid of any of the London-listed banks after the 2008 taxpayer bailouts, the more recent Libor-rigging scandal at Barclays and the money laundering offences at HSBC.</p> <p>Its top management team \u2013 the chief executive, Peter Sands, and the finance director, Richard Meddings \u2013 are held in such regard that only last week they were fending off questions about their potential candidacies for governor of the Bank of England or joining Barclays in the wake of the Libor scandal. </p> <p>The 27-page report claims that Standard Chartered bankers helped Iranian clients skirt US financial sanctions against their country for nearly a decade. <br>Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of the NYSDFS, said a Standard Chartered subsidiary in New York had also sought to do business with other US-sanctioned countries, including Libya, Burma and Sudan.</p> <p>It is the latest blow to the reputation of the City, already criticised in Washington following the HSBC money-laundering debacle and JP Morgan's multibillion-dollar trading losses at its London office.</p> <p>\"It seems to be that every big trading disaster happens in London,\" New York congresswoman Carolyn Maloney told a Congressional panel investigating the JP Morgan fiasco in June.</p> <p>The New York regulator has provided emails between members of Standard Chartered staff. In one the head of the US operations warned, among others, the executive director of risk in London, that the dealings with Iran could cause \"very serious or even catastrophic reputational damage\" to the group. </p> <p>The email, dated October 2006, warned: \"There is equally importantly potential of risk of subjecting management in US and London (e.g. you and I) and elsewhere to personal reputational damages and/or serious criminal liability.\" It was this memo that provoked the response about \"you f---ing Americans\".</p> <p>Financial transactions with Iran have been subject to US sanctions since 1979. Limited, highly scrutinised transactions known as \"U-turns\" were allowed as long as the money ended up in non-Iranian banks. In 2008 the US Treasury revoked authorisation for U-turn transactions, because it suspected that Iran was using its banks to finance nuclear weapons and missile programmes, and terrorist groups including Hezbollah and Hamas.</p> <p>According to Lawsky, Standard Chartered set up an operation known as Project Gazelle, aimed at helping Iranian banks put money through the US financial system. The bank is alleged to have removed codes to hide transfers for Iranians. </p> <p>\"For almost 10 years, SCB [Standard Chartered bank] schemed with the government of Iran and hid from regulators roughly 60,000 secret transactions, involving at least $250bn, and reaping SCB hundreds of millions of dollars in fees. </p> <p>\"SCB's actions left the US financial system vulnerable to terrorists, weapons dealers, drug kingpins and corrupt regimes, and deprived law enforcement investigators of crucial information used to track all manner of criminal activity,\" the regulator said. \"In short, SCB operated as a rogue institution.\"</p> <p>In one example from 2001 detailed in the report, Standard Chartered was approached by CBI/Markazi, Iran's central bank, to act as recipient for daily oil sales from the National Iranian Oil Company.</p> <p>Iranians warned the bank that disclosure of their identities to US banks would cause \"unacceptable delays in clearing funds\", according to the report.</p> <p>The bank took legal advice and was told it \"should ascertain that the payments are authorised\", according to the report. </p> <p>Instead, it \"conspired with Iranian clients to transmit misinformation to the New York branch by removing and otherwise misrepresenting wire transfer data that could identify Iranian parties\", the report claims.</p> <p>Standard Chartered, which is one of the top five largest banks in the UK by market value, was unprepared for the scale of the criticism, despite having made disclosures in previous annual reports \u2013 and in its interim report last week \u2013 about discussions with the US over breaking sanctions. </p> <p>The bank stressed that it had complied with the regulations. \"Well over 99.9% of the transactions relating to Iran complied,\" the bank said as Asian markets<br>opened for Tuesday.</p> <p>Discussions continue and the bank said it was \"surprised to receive\" the<br>regulatory order. \"The group takes its responsibilities very seriously and seeks to comply at all times with the relevant laws and regulations,\" the bank said.</p>",
  "<p>The most famous white suit in the world, a classic example of the finest 1970s polyester tailoring, has been tracked down by the Victoria and Albert Museum after an international search.</p> <p>The three-piece suit was as much a star of the 1977 film Saturday Night Fever as John Travolta who played Tony Manero, or the Bee Gees, who provided the soundtrack for the story of a young man who disco-dances his way out of the ghetto.</p> <p>Bought off the peg in a cheap men's clothes store in Brooklyn, the suit was last seen in public 17 years ago, when it was sold at a Christie's auction to an anonymous bidder for $145,000 (\u00a393,000), three times the top estimate. The curators of this autumn/winter's<a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/exhibitions/exhibition-hollywood-costume/\" title=\"\"> exhibition on Hollywood costume </a>were determined to find it and put out an international appeal. To their surprise it has turned up in London, in immaculate condition, and the owner has agreed to lend it to the museum.</p> <p>The owner, who wishes to remain anonymous but has let slip his age, is not a collector. He said: \"I was nine years old when Saturday Night Fever came out and before seeing the film I had already fallen in love with the legendary soundtrack.</p> <p>\"The ritual of [Travolta's character] choosing his clothes to go out at night, in a world of his own and disconnected from the reality of his life, particularly resonated with me. It was the first film I really loved, and in essence it was part of my own rite of passage \u2026 When I saw the suit on sale, I wanted to buy it because of what it represented to me personally.\"</p> <p>Professor Deborah Nadoolman Landis, a designer and historian of film costume \u2013 her own credits include Michael Jackson's Thriller video and Raiders of the Lost Ark \u2013 is senior curator of the exhibition. She said: \"Saturday Night Fever was actually a very dark little movie, and this suit, made of completely gross polyester, was the shining light, the symbol of aspiration and hope that shone in the film in that heart-stopping moment when it all comes together, the music, the lights, the suit, and Travolta dances in it.</p> <p>\"It took me totally by surprise. I fell completely in love with him, as everyone who sees the movie does.\"</p> <p>The broad lapels, tight waistcoat and high-waisted flared trousers \u2013 a 71cm (28in) waist which Travolta could never get into these days \u2013 have been endlessly imitated. But there is no doubt that this is the genuine article. The curators have already been to inspect it, and found conclusive proof in the actor's handwriting.</p> <p>It was first auctioned in 1978 for charity, when <a href=\"http://www.cmgww.com/stars/siskel/collector/index.htm\" title=\"\">the American critic Gene Siskel</a>, who listed Saturday Night Fever as one of his favourite films of all time, paid $2,000. The actor signed it and the inscription is still faintly visible in the lining: \"So here's to a classic, your friend, John Travolta.\"</p> <p>Originally the character of Tony Manero was to strut in a black suit, but white was the inspired choice of the film's costume designer, Patrizia Von Brandenstein. \"Heroes from Sir Lancelot to Tom Mix wore white in the great contests to express purity and single-minded devotion to the task at hand. So for me, white was the only choice for the suit.\"</p> <p>She went shopping in Brooklyn where the character lived, with the director John Badham, and Travolta \u2013 who was then starring in a hit television series, Welcome Back, Kotter. As word spread that he was in the neighbourhood, screaming mobs descended on the small clothes shop where he was trying on the suit, beating on the windows and pleading with him to come out.</p> <p>Nadoolman Landis said buying it off the peg was a piece of genius: \"Even in a low-budget movie like Saturday Night Fever, they could have found the money to make Tony a suit \u2013 but the fact that it was bought from an ordinary shop that anyone could go into gave it a great truth, exactly the sort of garment somebody from his background would see and long to own.\"</p> <p>Brandenstein actually bought several suits, two to dance in, and two that had to be turned up at the hem for Travolta's much shorter stunt double. The other suit worn by Travolta was stolen from an exhibition in the US, so Nadoolman Landis had almost abandoned hope of including the item in the V&amp;A show, which includes costumes worn by characters including Pirates of the Caribbean's Jack Sparrow, Holly Golightly from Breakfast at Tiffany's and Darth Vader.</p> <p>\"The costumes in this exhibition are so powerful that each has its own soundtrack which the visitor will hear in their heads \u2013 but even in this company the white suit is special,\"\u2211 \"It is the Turin shroud, the closest an ordinary mortal can come to the body of the actor.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 Hollywood Costume, Victoria and Albert Museum, London, October 2012 to January 2013 </em></p>",

  "<p>The king and the queen will take to the gleaming boards of an Olympic velodrome for the last time on Tuesday evening. Sir Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton have ridden at seven Olympic Games between them but even that venerable bank of experience might not be enough to stem the deluge of emotion that will swamp them once the final race is run and their dance is done.</p> <p>Pendleton, who will never race again, often laughs at the way cycling history has thrown her and Hoy together. In her most relaxed moments she will sigh, \"Me and my hero\", when talking about herself and Hoy. She will be just as jocular when, more mockingly, she reflects on \"me and my shadow\" \u2013 for, whatever Pendleton has achieved, Hoy has either matched or surpassed her.</p> <p>Together they have won seven Olympic golds between them and 20 world championship titles.Pendleton has won nine world sprint championships; Hoy has 11. The discrepancy occurs at the Olympics where the old rules of sexism, until these London Games, meant that women sprint cyclists could compete in only one event compared with the men's traditional treble. Hoy has won five Olympic titles to Pendleton's pair of golds.</p> <p>At 6pm it would be a major surprise if Hoy does not race in the final of the men's keirin \u2013 an event which he has dominated recently with his outrageous bike-handling, power and sheer force of personality. Fifteen minutes later, as soon as the keirin's medal ceremony is completed, the deciding third race of the women's sprint final is scheduled to start.</p> <p>Pendleton will hope to have already captured the gold medal by winning the first two races in a series of three. Should that occur, just before six, her victory will immediately be engulfed by Hoy's giant shadow. This time it will matter less. This time, should the sweetest of Olympic triumphs actually happen, Pendleton will barely be able to see Hoy race through the blur of tears.</p> <p>In Beijing it was different. Pendleton, after winning the individual sprint at the 2008 Olympic Games, had three minutes before the focus shifted. Three minutes to accept a flag and hold it above her head in a ritual gesture of victory while, on the inside, she felt numb. Three minutes to stand in front of the snappers as she stared at the clicking and popping cameras.</p> <p>And then they were gone. The eyes and the lenses turned elsewhere. They moved from Pendleton to Hoy. He won his third gold medal in Beijing, beating Jason Kenny in the individual sprint. Pendleton stresses that the switch of focus was, for her, painless. Yet, in symbolic terms, it reflected the inequality between women and men riders.</p> <p>Despite their accompanying differences in public profile and personal character, a twine of affection binds Hoy and Pendleton together. He might be bamboozled by Pendleton's penchant for baring both her body and her soul, and sceptical of the way she admits to her innate vulnerability, but he shares in their mutual respect for each other's supreme racing ability. On Friday Pendleton overcame the disappointment of having lost a certain silver medal, and a likely gold, in the team-sprint after she and Jess Varnish were disqualified. She rode the keirin with imperious control to clinch a memorable victory.</p> <p>Hoy, who had triumphed in the men's team-sprint on Thursday, responded enthusiastically on Twitter to his old friend's comeback: \"Great ride @v_pendleton. That's how to ride a Keirin!\" He was just as effusive on Sunday when she finished fastest in the individual qualifier: \"WORLD RECORD for @v_pendleton!! Perfection!\"</p> <p>Pendleton, in turn, talks with real warmth when remembering how, during one of the most difficult periods of her life, she briefly shared a flat in Manchester with Hoy in 2004. She had just returned from a lonely tenure at the UCI's sprint academy in Switzerland and Hoy made her laugh again. \"We watched television and ate lots of cereal,\" she says. \"After 18 months of eating the same sort of food, at the exact same hour, day after day, it felt deliciously decadent to have another bowl of cereal at 10 o'clock at night. If it was good enough for Chris Hoy, it was great for me. In training no one worked harder than Chris. I knew he was on course to win his first Olympic gold medal.\"</p> <p>Hoy won the kilometre time trial at the Athens Olympics while Pendleton, then especially fragile, did not come close to a medal. A year later, however, after her first world title, she joined \"the gang\" of champion riders at British Cycling \u2013 the only woman among an imposing group of men led by Hoy.</p> <p>\"I always laughed at the suggestion there was some kind of sexual chemistry between me and Chris,\" Pendleton says. \"Chris was my sprint hero and more like an older and slightly condescending big brother than someone I fancied. He was the world's best sprinter and I would have backed him to win any debate he entered. Whenever we had a good-natured exchange of views, I came off second-best. He's very eloquent and very competitive so Chris would demolish my argument while smiling. I was in awe of him as a cyclist and as a very smart and funny man. But I was never going to fall for Chris.\"</p> <p>Pendleton, instead, became involved in a relationship with Scott Gardner, her fiance now and a former sprint performance analyst at British cycling. Gardner contributed to Hoy's hat-trick of golds in Beijing but, after his enforced departure, he now works exclusively with Pendleton.</p> <p>The contrast between Hoy and Pendleton is stark. In public he is contained and controlled while, privately, he is sociable and witty. Pendleton is more open publicly \u2013 and willing to express her doubts in a way that sometimes horrifies Hoy. Yet on the track both are majestic competitors.</p> <p>On Monday Pendleton cruised through her quarter-final against Olga Panarina - winning two races without any need for a decisive third sprint. She will be expected to beat Germany's Kristina Vogel in the semis on Tuesday evening before facing, in another best-of-three finale, either Anna Meares or Shuang Guo.</p> <p>Hoy is likely to surge through Tuesday's early rounds of the keirin before joining Pendleton in a dramatic conclusion to London 2012's cycling programme. And then, in his last Olympic final, Hoy will be roared on by an ecstatic home crowd.</p> <p>Unlike Pendleton he will continue cycling, determined to ride in the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, where the new velodrome will be named after him. But his storming finish in the keirin marks his end as an Olympian.</p> <p>The cacophony for Pendleton in her last race will be just as intense and laced with emotion as this brilliant maverick of the track says goodbye to a sport she has loved and loathed in equal measure.</p> <p>One last regal gold medal apiece, for Hoy and for Pendleton, would unleash scenes to match anything we have already seen at these unforgettable Olympic Games.</p>",
  "<p>Harjit Jeji Shergill would not go so far as to say there was an inevitability to the murder of six Sikh worshipers at his local temple, but after years of people venomously calling him \"Bin Laden\" he feared it might come to this somewhere in America.</p> <p>As Oak Creek's Sikh community grapples with Sunday's tragedy it is buffeted by shock and mourning for some its best-known figures. There is also appreciation for the police officers who stopped the gunman \u2013 including one who took several bullets \u2013 and almost certainly saved other lives.</p> <p>But underpinning everything is a pouring forth of frustration, just short of anger, at what Sikhs in Oak Creek and other parts of the US say is the frequent assumption that because of their turbans and beards they are Muslims \u2013 with all the weight that carries since 9/11.</p> <p>One Sikh leader said that is an assumption \"with deadly consequences\". Another said that the Oak Creek killings are the \"collateral damage\" of the al-Qaida attacks.</p> <p>Jeji Shergill, 62, said that since 9/11 he has regularly been assumed to be Muslim and that routinely spills over into abuse. \"They compare us to the Muslims and we're completely different,\" he said. \"I own a gas station. I am working there. People, they call me Bin Laden. Then I explain to them: sorry, you are misunderstanding. You are mixing us up with the Muslims. You try to explain about the turban and the beard. They still call you Bin Laden.\"</p> <p>Shergill showed no great sympathy or solidarity with American Muslims who themselves endure unjustified abuse in the aftermath of 9/11, saying that Sikhs were better off getting away from them. But his account of being derisively called Bin Laden was not uncommon in Oak Creek.</p> <p>Satinder Singh, who lives close to the temple and left it shortly before the shooting because he had work to attend to, said he was subjected to verbal abuse on occasions but never felt physically threatened.</p> <p>\"Sometimes they call you a Muslim or Bin Laden. It's the way they say it. They are not fair to everybody,\" said Singh who immigrated from India 14 years ago. \"But I have not seen violence before. We did not expect it. We are peaceful. We open our arms to everyone.\"</p> <p>There are about 500,000 Sikhs in the United States but the community in Wisconsin is small, numbering about 2,500 to 3,000 families. Despite its relatively small presence in the US, the Sikh faith is the fifth-largest in the world, with more than 30 million followers. It includes a belief in one God and that the goal of life is to lead an exemplary existence. </p> <p>Jastit Singh, of the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund, said: \"A lot of the challenges we face as a community are because people don't know who we are. They don't know what we stand for and they make assumptions. It's those assumptions that can have deadly consequences.\"</p> <p>It is not clear whether the gunman, Wade Michael Page, targeted the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in the mistaken belief that its worshipers were Muslim. He had ties to white supremacist groups and may have been motivated by a broader racial prejudice.</p> <p>But the experiences of the Sikh community in Oak Creek, and incidents elsewhere in the US, means it will have to be convinced the shootings are not a legacy of 9/11.</p> <p>A few days after the al-Qaida attacks more than a decade ago, a Sikh man, Balbir Singh Sodhi, was shot dead in Arizona by a man who assumed he was a Muslim. Other attacks followed and the passing of time has not diminished the false assumptions.</p> <p>In April, 92 members of Congress signed a letter urging the FBI to collect information on hate crimes against Sikhs. The effort was led by a New York Congressman, Joe Crowley, who said the Sikh community \"is acutely susceptible to violence because of their appearance\".</p> <p>Amardeep Singh, of the Sikh Coalition, said that in addressing audiences since 9/11 he usually poses a question. \"When you see a turban and beard, what is the first thing you think of? The answer is inevitably what? I think of a terrorist. We've had 11 years where the turban is equated with terrorism,\" he said. \"Is our community an intentional victim? \u2026 No, we're collateral damage.\"</p> <p>Among those appealing for a change in attitude was Amardeep Kaleka, whose father, Satwant \u2013 a founder of the temple and its president \u2013 was shot dead on Sunday.</p> <p>Keleka described how his father arrived in the US with little money and built up a flourishing petrol station business. He was, said his son, such an enthusiast for the \"American Dream\" that years ago he planted an enormous US flag in front of his house. \"When we came home from high school that day we said: papa, this thing is an eyesore,\" said Kaleka.</p> <p>But his father told them to look down the street and see the flags flying from other houses. \"You're in America now,\" he said.</p> <p>Kaleka said his father remained convinced that Americans would accept them as Sikhs. Many people in Oak Creek on Monday expressed sympathy and solidarity with the Sikh community as government offices and business lowered flags to half mast, and some churches, banks and individuals put up signs of support.</p> <p>But for all that, on Monday Kaleka sounded sceptical about his father's optimism. \"We should know that America needs to have cultural understanding for anybody it deals with. Ninety-nine percent of this nation is immigrants. We need to know each other,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 Being right at the wrong time can be the same as being wrong, a wise man once said. And this is the fear of every politician. At a basic level, it's all about judgments. Pity the poor politico whose judgment goes awry. Pity Haringey council deputy leader <a href=\"http://www.minutes.haringey.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=789\" title=\"\">Bernice Vanier</a>, who attended the memorial service for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/03/mark-duggan-mother-waiting-answers\" title=\"\">Mark Duggan</a>, whose death in police hands triggered last summer's riots. In Tottenham on Sunday there were prayers, gospel singing, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Staple_Singers\" title=\"\">Staple Singers </a>classics and the like. All was well until Vanier got up to speak, for her focus was all about the post-riot regeneration money that the authority was pouring into Tottenham. Mark Duggan's sister <a href=\"http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/mark-duggan%E2%80%99s-sister-aiming-engage-youths\" title=\"\">Paulette Hall</a> got very angry, insisting that the service was about remembering Mark, not about all the money the council had received in the wake of the riots. Family members and others walked out, and only after hurried negotiations did they agree to return. After the hullabaloo, Vanier said: \"I think there was a bit of a misunderstanding. The family felt the service was about Mark, but from my perspective it was also about the rebuilding of Tottenham.\" Right speech, fine speech. Wrong time.</p> <p>\u2022 Plaudits come thick and fast for the distinguished military historian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/05/sir-john-keegan?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Sir John Keegan</a>. He was revered by the others in his field. And, at the Daily Telegraph, he was the doyen of British defence correspondents. Still, it's fair to say that he took a little while to get used to the hurly-burly of daily news reporting. After a short time in the job, Keegan was called by the night news desk about a story appearing in the first edition of the Times. Can you check it out, they asked him. \"Ooh, I should think that's true,\" he said cheerily. \"Their defence correspondent is jolly good, you know.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Keegan had contacts second to none with the Ministry of Defence. For the most part, this was an invaluable advantage. Occasionally it was a hindrance. On one occasion, after a reporter called the MoD for its take on a soldier who had gone absent without leave, alleging abuse, Keegan \u2013 who had played no part in the story up to that point \u2013 ambled over to the hack's desk. \"That soldier you are interested in \u2013 he wasn't very good,\" he said. \"Didn't fit in. They didn't really think he was up to it.\" \"That's strange,\" the reporter replied. \"All of the reports were glowing, and they were using him as a role model to recruit other minority soldiers at the Royal Tournament.\" \"Oh, is that right?\" said Keegan. \"They didn't tell me that.\"</p> <p>\u2022 There is a fine time being had in the Olympic village, and one reason is that, for a while at least, the competitors are all the same. Multimillionaires rub shoulders with Corinthians. Never more so than when they are being checked by security. On one occasion, an athlete pressed his pass against the reader and waited for the clearance that would follow once his name flashed up on the security screen. \"Ryan Giggs,\" chirped the security guard, without looking up. \"Did you know there is also a footballer who goes by that name?\" You don't say.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, the reviewers have pronounced on Batman The Dark Knight Rises. But none is truly qualified to evaluate what we are seeing on the screen. With that in mind, <a href=\"http://www.totalfilm.com/\" title=\"\">Total Film</a> magazine turns to <a href=\"http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/sport-exercise/staff/mhb/\" title=\"\">Dr Mark Burnley, PhD</a>, a lecturer in exercise physiology at the University of Aberystwyth. \"Batman's premise, that he is an ordinary man doing extraordinary things, means that, physiologically, he cannot be 'superhuman',\" writes the academic. \"Given that he doesn't seem to dedicate much time to training and that he's not extremely muscular, it's hard to see how he could fight off several people repeatedly without fatiguing and damaging muscle and bone.\" The outfit Batman wears, says Dr Burnley, is also a con. \"His suit (though iconic) is totally unsuited to sustained high-intensity effort. It would impose heat injury \u2013 or, at the very least, a form of brain fatigue that reduces the motivation to be physically active. If Batman was realistically portrayed, he would be in a state of lethargy for the second half of the movies.\" And with that mask, that cape and those tight trousers, he'd be checking out the S&amp;M bars of Gotham City. </p> <p><em>twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/hugh_muir\" title=\"\"><em>@hugh_muir</em></a></p>",
  "<p>When Adam Applegarth was forced out of a sinking Northern Rock in December 2007, it was amid the kind of numbers that tend to dance in front of your eyes. In the five years running up to the bank's spectacular crash he had been paid around \u00a310m. During the 18 months immediately before he cashed in shares worth \u00a32.6m. On leaving he secured a golden goodbye to be paid in monthly instalments, totalling \u00a3760,000. His pension, payable when he turns 55, is worth \u00a3304,000 a year.</p> <p>The year after his exit he was glimpsed in a very familiar setting, once again turning out for the second XI of his beloved Sunderland Cricket Club. \"This summer,\" said one of his old associates, \"he will be putting his feet up. He is playing an awful lot of cricket, enjoying his motors and travelling.\"</p> <p>In the autumn of 2009 Applegarth became a senior adviser to the American private equity firm Apollo Management, advising a new arm, the European Principal Fund, on the buying-up of distressed debt \u2013 perhaps a field of expertise. Three years on he remains in the job and shielded behind a communications firewall administered by a New York PR firm called Rubenstein Associates, whose other clients include Walt Disney, the Las Vegas Comedy Festival, and the American Kennel Club.</p> <p>When I contacted them, I was handed over to a breathlessly efficient operative called Melissa, who said I should send over my questions. With a view to at least trying to get his attention, I kept them non-confrontational, and short: What does Mr Applegarth's role at Apollo involve? Could he explain how the depth of banks' problems in 2007 first revealed itself to him? And how has his life been since? Twenty-four hours later she called back: \"Put us down for a decline to comment,\" she said.</p> <p>So, on to another lead. In September 2010 it was reported that Applegarth had joined his son Greg in setting up a company called Beechwood Property Management, in which he held 55 of the 100 shares. Their documents list both men's occupation as \"consultant\". Their registered office is on the 11th floor of a gleaming Newcastle office block called Cale Cross House, but when I called the in-house security guard he had never heard of them. In fact, this is merely the address of their accountants \u2013 who passed on a message, with no result.</p> <p>There is no entry for Beechwood Property Management in the phone directory, nor has it a website. On the face of it, it is a ghost outfit, whose existence is only noticeable to those hard-bitten people who pore over records held at Companies House.</p> <p>Such is the great cloud of silence that now surrounds people who were once among the loudest voices in the financial services industry.</p> <p>The reclusive lifestyle of former Royal Bank of Scotland chief Fred Goodwin barely needs mentioning. Steve Crawshaw, who turned Bradford and Bingley from a staid building society into a specialist in self-certified mortgages and left the company weeks before it had to be nationalised, has apparently retired to the Yorkshire countryside: his only publicly-recorded activity these days is as the chair of the advisory board of the School of Management at Bradford University, who forwarded him my list of questions, but I heard nothing back.</p> <p>Even the few who still have heavyweight business roles keep schtum: there may be a beautiful poetry in the fact that the former HBOS chief executive Andy Hornby is now the boss of Coral bookmakers, but getting him to talk is a non-starter. \"As the article does not relate to his current role at Coral he wishes to respectfully decline your request,\" said his spokesman.</p> <p>At the height of a financialised age, it was the done thing to refer to these people as \"Masters Of The Universe\". Five years on, picking through the subsequent career histories of those who sparked first the credit crunch and then the crash, the suggestion of omnipotence sounds absurd. Most of the people at the centre of the events of 2007-8 tend to suggest a much less titanic stereotype: the faded rock star, often still trying to keep their hand in, well aware that the hits have dried up, the old tricks have long since turned embarrassing, and their time has passed.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a very awkward question sits in the public mind: will there ever be any convincing payback?</p> <p>In the US, only a tiny handful of former bankers have been criminally indicted on charges relating to the crash: most notably, Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin, two former Bear Stearns employees \u2013 and one-time sub-prime specialists \u2013 who were acquitted of fraud and conspiracy in November 2009. In February this year a civil case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission was settled on the basis of a $1.05m payout from the two, which the judge in charge termed \"chump change\".</p> <p>The only big figure sent to jail for his part in two decades of crazed speculation and irresponsibility has been Bernie Madoff. By contrast, the people who bundled up the bad debt in arcane financial instruments that pushed the world to the brink of ruin are still out there: hugely diminished \u2013 but free, and hardly penniless.</p> <p>Even those who steered Lehman Brothers into catastrophe and thus started the decisive crash of 2008 seem to have got away with it. In May this year an internal memo from the SEC leaked to Reuters said that after its investigation into the bank it had been \"determined that charges will likely not be recommended\".</p> <p>Which brings us to 780 3rd Avenue in Manhattan, the location of an almost comically dull office block that looks like a giant house brick.</p> <p>Inside is the HQ of Matrix Advisors. Its founder is a byword for the events of 2007-8: Dick Fuld, the CEO of Lehmans, until its cataclysmic demise. Back then, he was the pumped-up corporate icon once known as \"the Gorilla\", the man who summed up his business style with the boast that he wanted to reach into the bodies of Lehmans' competitors, \"rip out their hearts and eat it in front of them before they die\".</p> <p>These days he apparently flits between New York and his homes in Florida and Sun Valley, Idaho \u2013 on bog-standard commercial flights, according to witnesses \u2013 looking after a tiny outfit which provides \"strategic advice to client management teams and senior employees \u2026 across all aspects of business\". One source close to Fuld has said that the workforce extends to \"a young guy from Lehman and two secretaries\". When I called their office, I therefore had the tantalising sense that the figure most indelibly associated with the crash might only be a few yards from the person parrying my questions. Her name was Carla Schiavo: she suggested I send over a few lines of inquiry.</p> <p>What, I asked, does Mr Fuld's work at Matrix Advisors involve? What are his views on the aftermath of the credit crunch and how banks and regulators have responded? What did the financial services industry need to do to recover its esteem? Eventually, Schiavo pointed me in the direction of Fuld's lawyer, a former president of the New York Bar Association named Patricia Hynes \u2013 who, predictably enough, did not deign to reply to either phone calls or emails.</p> <p>Two months ago Fuld was seen at an ice hockey game between the New Jersey Rangers and the New York Devils. An eyewitness reported on the scene for the Wall Street news and gossip site Dealbreaker: \"He was with two goons who were clearly his bodyguards, one sitting next to him in a tan jacket and the other one standing behind him in black. Fuld was wearing a suit \u2026 I guess to try and look like he actually has a job he was coming from before the game.\"</p> <p>Documents filed with US regulators two years ago said Fuld's work at his new venture stretched to around 60 hours a week. Such hard graft may be a necessity: proof, as with the sale of his Park Avenue apartment three years ago (for $25.87m) that he may not be enjoying quite the life of unending luxury that some would imagine, and setting money aside for future litigation, which has so far been met from the coffers of Lehmans' insurers. There is also an abiding sense of twitchiness. When a reporter doorstepped him three years ago, he blurted out: \"You don't have a gun. That's good.\"</p> <p>For others who were intimately involved in the crash, there is a similar sense of shrunken lives, and mouths sealed shut. Kathleen Corbet was the president of the hugely important ratings agency Standard &amp; Poors, but quit in August 2007 just as it started to become clear that the safe-as-houses triple-A ratings given to mortgage-backed securities had turned out to be illusory. She is now in charge of Cross Ridge Capital, a small private equity firm based in New Canaan, Connecticut \u2013 and did not respond to messages asking for her take on what happened in 2007 onwards, and what has transpired since.</p> <p>Neither did Maurice \"Hank\" Greenberg, who pumped up AIG to the point that the American group became the biggest insurance company in the world \u2013 only to watch it plunge towards bankruptcy and become 80% nationalised by the US government.</p> <p>He resigned two years before the start of the crash, in 2005, in the midst of the accounting scandal that began the firm's nosedive \u2013 but the fact that he avoided direct involvement in the crash presumably accounts for the fact that in controlled circumstances, he can speak with a belligerence that might suggest the events of 2007-8 never happened.</p> <p>\"We now have huge government, which is not the creator of opportunity \u2013 it's the private sector that creates opportunity, so our basic values are under attack,\" he recently said, warning against the prospect of \"regulating ourselves out of business\". By way of putting his money where his mouth is, Greenberg is suing the US state for $25bn, alleging that AIG's board was \"coerced\" into turning over control of the company to the federal government.</p> <p>Such a high-profile action contrasts with the post-crash story of his old AIG colleague Joseph Cassano \u2013 the man who sold credit default swaps in London to keep the money coming in, and thereby pushed the company towards such ruin that it needed \u00a3182bn of US taxpayers' money to keep it alive. Back then, Cassano lived in an opulent townhouse behind Harrod's. He has since moved back to Westport, on Long Island Sound, where he is apparently unemployed, and uncontactable.</p> <p>But if there is one man who remains the best embodiment of all the delusion and absurdity that led to the crash, it is 74-year-old Angelo Mozilo, the son of a Bronx butcher, a man so tanned that his skin looks like an orange dipped in toffee. Until July 2008 he was the chairman and chief executive of Countrywide Financial, the USA's biggest provider of sub-prime mortgages. Between 2001 and 2006 he took home something in the region of $470m.</p> <p>The company crashed from August 2007 onwards, finally being bought out by the Bank Of America. In a civil case that ended in October 2010 Mozilo settled with the SEC to pay $22.5m to cover allegations of fraud and insider trading, with a further $45m going to his company's former shareholders to cover \"ill-gotten gains\", to be taken from BoA and Countrywide's insurers.</p> <p>The SEC's director of enforcement said this: \"Mozilo's record penalty is the fitting outcome for a corporate executive who deliberately disregarded his duties to investors by concealing what he saw from inside the executive suite \u2013 a looming disaster in which Countrywide was buckling under the weight of increasingly risky mortgage underwriting, mounting defaults and delinquencies, and a deteriorating business model.\" At the same time, Mozilo was cashing in shares to the tune of $285m.</p> <p>Last year a criminal investigation into Mozilo's activities was shelved. But the intrigue swirling around him will not go away: four years after stories about his firm's dealings with American lawmakers first appeared in the media, a Congressional Committee has alleged that Mozilo ran a \"Friends of Angelo\" unit to grant influential members of congress preferential loans, and thereby subdue any drive to rein in his very risky kind of business.</p> <p>The impact of what Mozilo and his company did cannot be overstated: it was Countrywide that led the drive to drown the international financial system in bad debt, while he was paying himself spectacular amounts of money. In Wall Street, the City and beyond, the result of what he and his colleagues were doing was a deathly panic, and the end of the boom years; in the real world, millions of people had their homes repossessed or lost their jobs and now we labour under the austerity cuts that still grip the Western economies like a vice.</p> <p>In May this year a piece in the LA Times reported that Mozilo and his wife Phyllis had sold their home in Thousand Oaks, 29 miles west of near LA, for $2.9m. It described a \"Georgian Colonial-style two-storey\" property, sitting above the second fairway at the Sherwood Country Club, complete with \"a cherry-finished library-office, five bedrooms, six bathrooms and an oversized four-car garage\", along with \"an infinity pool, spa, lawn and a built-in barbecue\".</p> <p>Reading it, you wondered if perhaps, in their own way, the Mozilos were feeling the pinch. And then came the last sentence, and the sickly scent of the high life, uninterrupted: \"They hold other southern California properties in trust, in Riverside and Santa Barbara counties.\"</p>",
  "<p>That was the greatest field we have ever seen in the history of the 100m and Usain Bolt made them all look ordinary. After all the smoke clouds he had been sending out about his fitness, now we know that Bolt is in absolutely flying form. When he is in this sort of shape those aren't races he is running in but demonstrations. The speed he was running Bolt would have set off speed traps. The 80,000 people who were there to see it will remember it for the rest of their lives.</p> <p>Before the Games Sunday night was the hot ticket. People were willing to pay ridiculous amounts of money to get good seats and now we know why. I had tipped Yohan Blake before the race because I wasn't sure what shape Bolt was in. But when he is running like this no one can touch him. I make him the firm favourite for the 200m now and I expect he'll go for a world record in it to boot. I'd already say he is the greatest sprinter the world has ever seen but, if he doubles up in the 200m too, winning back-to-back golds in both events at successive Olympics, we'll all just have to bow down in front of him and say \"we are not worthy\".</p> <p>It was interesting to hear him say afterwards that the two races he lost to Blake at the Jamaican trials were such a wake-up call for him, \"like Blake was knocking on my door and saying, 'Yo, Usain, it's Olympic year, I'm ready, are you?'\" When the time came, he was. And that's one of his great gifts, along with all those fast-twitch fibres and long levers. Bolt has got the perfect body for a sprinter but he has also got the psychological game too. For an athlete that's invaluable. You can only ever perform at your best when you're relaxed. Bolt is so chilled out he almost falls asleep on the blocks and it wouldn't surprise me if one day he just fell over sideways because he had drifted off while he was waiting for the start gun.</p> <p>That doesn't mean Bolt wasn't fretting before the race. I don't believe for one second he went out on that track without any worries. He is a great showman and as laid-back an athlete as we have ever seen on the start line but his stomach would have been churning while he was on the warm-up track, his legs would have felt weak because of all that adrenaline pumping through his body. But he controls and harnesses that energy better than anyone we have ever seen.</p> <p>I thought Blake wanted it just a little bit too much. He came out of the blocks and started to tense up a little bit straight away. Don't get me wrong, if he had run the perfect race I still don't think he would have caught Bolt but he would have been clear in second place.</p> <p>He'll learn from that. It is going to be interesting to see how he responds in the 200m. As for Asafa Powell, he says he pulled up because he has a quad strain but I can't help but wonder whether it was just because he was getting his arse kicked in another major final.</p> <p>The biggest loser in that race was Tyson Gay. I cannot stand Justin Gatlin, who has tested positive for banned substances twice in his career. You wonder how Gay feels about it too, given how much anti-doping campaigning he has done in his time. He can't say anything about a guy who is his team-mate but I know what I'd feel if I was in his shoes \u2013 how the hell is that fair? I hope Gay knows that every single British athletics fan feels that way.</p> <p>I have to give a mention to Christine Ohuruogu, too. She's another athlete who knows how to get the best out of herself when it counts.</p> <p>What a turnaround that was. She produced the goods after two of the worst years of her life. It was only last year that people were talking about whether or not she would retire because she was having such a shocker. So to run the second-fastest time of her life when it matters was brilliant.</p> <p>I know Chrissie will have mixed emotions, because she was so close to winning gold again, but people will still see her as a hero because of what she has done. And as someone who has come fourth at two Olympic Games, I know that silver is a hell of an achievement. A few of the other British athletes \u2013 and I'm thinking about the men's 400m team here \u2013 would do well to look at her example.</p> <p>Like Bolt she is the epitome of an athlete who knows how to perform when it matters most. And at an Olympic Games that is all that counts.</p>",
  "<p>The future of democracy in Syria is the subject of many concerns: people are worried about the treatment of minorities and women, possible acts of revenge, and the likelihood of <a href=\"http://wagingnonviolence.org/2011/12/transitional-justice-in-between-dictatorship-and-democracy/\" title=\"\">transitional justice</a>. Some ask about universal human rights. Others exaggerate fears of religious tyranny.</p> <p>But ultimately all these anxieties \u2013 intentionally or unintentionally \u2013 only serve the interests of the rapists and child killers of Bashar al-Assad's regime.</p> <p>We believe the position to take on Assad and his cabal is essentially a moral one. It is no longer a matter of political debate. Syrians must put their case to the court of global public opinion in the following direct manner: Assad, are you prepared to accept thousands of documented crimes, the torture of children and the rape of women by the state apparatus that should protect them?</p> <p>Behind the concerns for democracy in a post-Assad Syria is typical negative stereotyping of Islamic society. Is it fair that after half a century of totalitarian rule the world should disregard a civilisation whose existence extends so deep into history? The Syrian cities of Damascus, Aleppo and Homs are so ancient that their first inhabitants are not known. The eastern shores of the Mediterranean share a long history and a crucible of cultures, religions and peoples, who have always coexisted.</p> <p>The history of Syria did not begin with the Assad family. There are in Syria today descendants of peoples that go back hundreds of years before the birth of Christ. Over centuries Christians and Jews have lived together with Muslims, without restrictions on their rights. Syria is proud to preserve the <a href=\"http://www.omniglot.com/writing/syriac.htm\" title=\"\">Syriac language</a>, which was the means of translation from older civilisations during the early Islamic era. And only in Syria are there communities that still speak Aramaic, the language of Christ.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14703995\" title=\"\">modern history of Syria since its formation after the first world war </a>has also witnessed its ability to preserve its pluralist nature and protect universal human rights. Since the 1920 national conference that founded the modern state, all the elements of Syrian society have taken part in cultural and political affairs \u2013 a reality that continued until the last truly elected parliament, overthrown by the military on 8 March 1963, hijacking public life in Syria until now.</p> <p>The future that Syrians aspire to is an extension of that earlier era. After 50 years of autocratic rule, our national position and political record emphasises that we will not move towards autocracy, be that religious, political or social. The Muslim Brotherhood is committed to a Syria in which citizenship is the basis of rights and duties, and Syrians can reconstruct their unified civil society where the concept of majority and minority gradually disappears. Women must be given ample opportunity to assert themselves so future generations can play their crucial part in this national project.</p> <p>Some have sought to distort the noble image of our revolution, depicting it as a proxy for foreign interests repeating the propaganda of the decaying regime. Nothing could be more erroneous. This is, indeed, the ultimate insult to the tens of thousands who have given their lives for a democratic, free and prosperous Syria \u2013 in what is truly a people's revolution that, against all odds, has reached every corner of the country. Our vision of a fully independent Syria, master of its destiny, protects its people while rejecting the pitfalls of subservience and foreign control.</p> <p>With regard to transitional justice, we believe that the ruling clique has transgressed all boundaries of aggression, and that the desire for reprisal is inevitable. But our faith emphasises that retribution must be enacted through a fair judicial process. There should be no revenge killings, and we reject the targeting of any group on religious, sectarian or political grounds. We are worried that the international community's exaggerated reiteration of concern for minorities justifies the slaughter of the majority, and is counterproductive.</p> <p>The Syria that we aspire to is a civil state that is sovereign and in which the individual enjoys all the fundamental rights guaranteed in international laws and conventions of human rights, without any discrimination on the basis of religion, sect, ethnicity or social background. We seek to build a state founded on a civil constitution with separation of powers, and where all citizens, men and women, will participate in its governance through the ballot box in a free and fair manner that allows the election of the most capable to every office.</p> <p>As I write this article, my besieged city of Aleppo \u2013 under bombardment from ground and air \u2013 is without water, electricity, food or medicine. Even the Red Cross has decided to withdraw, leaving the people to face the butchers alone. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2012/jul/19/syria-crisis-russia-china-veto-un-resolution-live-updates\" title=\"\">Russian and Chinese UN veto</a> has become a wall that the conscience of the free world hides behind.

  "<p>Helen Carter's report on Shafilea Ahmed's death (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/03/shafilea-ahmed-parents-guilty-murder\" title=\"\">Parents jailed for life</a>, 4 August) highlights a tragedy for the communities and her siblings but it also raises broader complex issues for society as well. Carter is right in her observation about cultures in collision. In the late 1990s we published a series of studies on rates of self-harm across communities. These studies showed rates of self-harm in south Asian women aged 18-24 were three times higher than their British counterparts. They were more likely to attempt self-harm as a result of domestic violence, alcohol abuse and cultural conflict. This is the vulnerable age when individuals start to assert their identity and move away from home and individuate.</p> <p>Prior to writing the reports we presented these findings to members of south Asian communities, largely women in public meetings in south and west London. Women and men who attended responded by saying that they knew this was going on and urged us to educate parents, peers and the wider community about the causes. We&#xa0;produced educational leaflets which in a follow-up study revealed that the knowledge about self-harm and potential sources of help had gone up.</p> <p>Education about cultural values and the role that cultural assimilation can play is critical if future tragedies such as this are to be avoided.<br><strong>Dinesh Bhugra</strong><br><em>Professor of mental health and cultural diversity, King's College London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The problem the UK and the entire world faces in light of the murder of Shafilea Ahmed and many other similar cases is not just that of honour killings. The real issue is the very notion of honour that's pervasive in conservative Muslim societies. Many people in these communities strongly believe that women are representative of and carry with them their entire family's dignity, and men are responsible for keeping them in check.</p> <p>Growing up in such a culture, I was constantly reprimanded by men who asked how I could allow girls in my family to dress and act the way they do. I&#xa0;never knew how to respond, because the idea that women are autonomous human beings who have the right to do what they wish with their bodies is foreign to many men in this ultra-patriarchal society.</p> <p>Sentencing Shafilea's parents for the murder of their daughter is a step in the right direction, but the only real solution is for Muslims to radically change their societies to rid them of this oppressive, tribalist concept of \"honour\".<br><strong>Abdullah Alhomoud</strong><br><em>Sulaibikhat, Kuwait</em></p> <p>\u2022 Reading about the conviction of Shafilea Ahmed's parents of her murder, the tragic loss of such a young life is shocking. Shafilea had the courage to refuse a forced marriage imposed by her parents and paid with her life. The freedom to accept or refuse a husband is a right granted to all women by Islam. While violence against women is not an issue for one culture only, it is well overdue for some to abandon the old traditions and to live in the modern world.<br><strong>Mohammed Samaana</strong><br><em>Belfast</em></p> <p>\u2022 I strongly support your leading article (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/03/shafilea-ahmed-a-girl-betryaed\" title=\"\">A girl betrayed</a>, 4 August). However, it should be recognised that \"honour killings\" are merely the tip of the iceberg. What remains hidden is the widespread denial in the UK of basic human rights to many Muslim women. In practice, \"justice\" is often only available to such women through Sharia courts. Sharia law is, at least to a large extent, incompatible with basic human rights. For example, the evidence of a female witness is worth half that of a man.</p> <p>The spotlight needs to be shone on the treatment of women in many Muslim communities in the UK. Until that is done and all Muslim women are empowered to enjoy the same rights as non-Muslim women, this ill-treatment will continue and we shall, almost certainly, see the death of more victims such as Shafilea Ahmed.<br><strong>Chris Peeler</strong><br><em>Wendover, Buckinghamshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Jacqueline Rose claims that Shafilea Ahmed's case should not be used to stigmatise a minority community (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/05/shafilea-ahmed-murder-migration-modernity\" title=\"\">A crime meshed in migration and modernity</a>, 6&#xa0;August). What if a significant section of that community supports honour killings or refuses to face the issue head-on? Moreover, there is enough empirical evidence to show that honour killings are largely specific to Muslim and Sikh communities. No doubt we need to approach the subject of honour killings with great care, making sure we do not tar the entire Muslim community with the same brush. But we also need to remember the saying attributed to Aristotle: \"Plato is dear to me, but dearer still is truth.\"<br><strong>Randhir Singh Bains</strong><br><em>Gants Hill, Essex</em></p> <p>\u2022 The judge told the parents of Shafilea Ahmed: \"Your concern about being shamed in your community was greater than the love of your child.\" I believe the vast majority of Pakistanis and Muslims would be utterly ashamed to have any association with this couple. Child abuse, domestic violence and then murder. A truly heart-wrenching case but justice was achieved in the end. Rest&#xa0;in peace now, Shafilea.<br><strong>Emilie Lamplough</strong><br><em>Trowbridge, Wiltshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your editorial, reflecting on the grotesque circumstances of Shafilea Ahmed's abuse and murder by her parents, appears just two weeks after you <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/17/german-court-ruling-circumscribing-law\" title=\"\">defended the \"right\" of Jewish and Muslim parents</a> to mutilate their children in the context of the German court's decision on circumcision.

  "<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was born and raised in this country. I played little league baseball. My Mom was a soccer mom. I'm a diehard Yankees fan. I'm an American.</p> </blockquote> <p>As an American Sikh, this was my most \"quotable quote\" in the news media during the year or so after 9/11. Those words worked well for reporters or producers framing hate crimes stories back then as \"crimes of ignorance\" against a small, misunderstood minority.</p> <p>So why, almost 11 years later, in the wake of Sunday's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/06/wisconsin-suspect-wade-michael-page\">shootings at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin</a>, do I find myself uttering those words again to reporters?</p> <p>Across the country, Sikh Americans are asking themselves similar questions as they are once again pressed to explain themselves to the public. One would hope that almost 11 years after that fateful day, and more than 100 years after Sikhs came to the United States,&#xa0;there would be a better understanding of Sikhs and their contributions to America's well-being.</p> <p>But the 24-hour news cycle does not work that way. Fed a steady diet of Bin Laden and Taliban images, most Americans simply associate the turban, which Sikh men wear as an expression of faith, with terrorism. Turban equals terrorist in the minds of too many.</p> <p>In part, Sikh Americans are collateral damage of a modern climate that rarely has time for explanations of our culture, our heritage, and our beliefs. This enduring legacy of 9/11 continues to stubbornly attach itself to our community. Not only do many people not know of the peaceful beliefs of our faith, but they wrongly associate us with acts of unspeakable terrorism.</p> <p>At present, we don't know whether the shooter, Wade Michael Page was motivated by these mistaken beliefs. His reported association with white supremacist groups may mean that he was motivated by a more generalized hatred of non-whites. But we do know that far too many Americans have misguided prejudices about the Sikh community \u2013 just as they do of the American Muslim community, whose law-abiding and loyal citizens often suffer those same \"crimes of ignorance\".</p> <p>While Sikh Americans are part of the national fabric, working in every profession, serving in our armed forces, and holding important positions in civic life, at the same time, Sikh Americans experience an alarming rate of hate crimes, job discrimination, school bullying, and racial profiling. </p> <p>Still, there are rays of light in this tragedy. On Sunday, CNN and other print and broadcast outlets expended more constructive copy on Sikhs than I have ever witnessed. Journalists of all sorts rushed to explain the basic tenets of the Sikh religion and the practice of our faith.&#xa0;To be fair, the American Sikh community also has to do more to share our heritage with our neighbors. We need a more organized effort to persuade schools to teach children about their Sikh classmates, more meaningful interfaith outreach, and more well-known and accessible spokespeople.</p> <p>It may take years of concerted effort by Sikhs, the media, civil society, and government to&#xa0;create an environment where Sikhs are respected and even celebrated in their communities, but with this great tragedy comes the great responsibility to make sure that the educational work gets done. We all deserve to live in a society where no one need fear violent attack \u2013 whether at a temple, mosque, synagogue or church \u2013 simply because of our ethnic and religious identity.</p>",
  "<p>Last month the House of Commons effectively killed the government's House of Lords reform bill by denying it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/10/lords-reform-timetable-vote-withdrawal?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">a timetabling motion</a>. The bill has lingered on life support for a few weeks while ministers looked for alternative ways of getting the legislation back on its feet. Unsurprisingly, those efforts have quickly come to nothing. So on Monday, while the nation's attention remained focused on the Olympics, Nick Clegg switched the machine off. It was a very good day to bury some very bad news. Mr Clegg called it hitting the pause button. The reality is he has moved it to trash. House of Lords reform has waited for a century or more. Now it must wait even longer.</p> <p>Mr Clegg's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19146853\" title=\"\">announcement</a> was nevertheless a lengthy one, more than 1,300 words to say that the game was up. Public opinion is unlikely to care very much either way. Most people have more pressing concerns than Lords reform, principally economic anxieties. Most Lib Dems, and certainly most Lib Dem MPs, will welcome Mr Clegg's tit-for-tat decision to vote against the implementation of the new parliamentary<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/06/nick-clegg-blocks-boundary-changes\" title=\"\"> boundary changes.</a> That's one big bullet dodged \u2013 and good news for Labour too. But it is not the end of the gunfire.</p> <p>The failure of Lords reform matters most in the context of Britain's long failure to bring its legislative institutions into the democratic era. The bill was certainly not perfect. Its handling lacked the requisite political skill. Yet no one with any nerve of feeling for Britain's unfinished constitutional reform agenda can be anything but disgusted at this outcome. Conservatism, whether with a large C or a small c, has won again. Any future government attempting to renew the reform will have to learn from Mr Clegg's mistakes. One such lesson could be that New Labour got it right in 1997 over devolution, by putting the principle to an early referendum and obtaining a mandate that intimidated the trouble-makers and vested interests.</p> <p>But the withdrawal of the bill raises large governmental and political issues too. This is the first time that the coalition government has failed to deliver on the agreement that the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats struck in May 2010. The failure was not down to the Lib Dems who, rightly or wrongly, have delivered on the 2010 deal, even when they disliked what they were having to vote for. The same cannot be said, however, about the Tories. A majority of their <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/parliament/2012/07/sky-news-says-91-conservative-mp-vote-against-lords-reform-bill-thats-bigger-than-the-eu-referendum-.html\" title=\"\">backbenchers </a> voted against the government last month or abstained. Their revolt was eloquent proof of a party which is increasingly fretting to shift to the right and which David Cameron seems to have neither the inclination nor the ability to prevent from doing so. The success of the Tory revolt sends a powerful reactionary signal, the more so in the light of the Tory party's successful campaign against the alternative vote in 2011. Mr Cameron has proved to be a false friend of reform. And the Tory party is still reform's enemy.</p> <p>Where does this leave Mr Clegg and his party? For a party of reform, it is not in a good place. Granted, Mr Clegg has not had an easy hand to play. As he said on Monday, his party only has 8% of the votes in the Commons, so he can't be expected to win every time.

  "<h2>Central bankers</h2> <p><strong>Alan Greenspan, chairman US Federal Reserve 1987-2006</strong><br>A disciple of libertarian icon Ayn Rand, Greenspan became chairman of the Fed just in time to save the global economy from the 1987 stock market crash from becoming a full-blown disaster. He went on preside over the boom years of the 90s and lead the US economy through the aftermath of the September 11 attacks and was widely referred to as an \"oracle\" and \"the maestro\".</p> <p>But Greenspan's super-low interest rates and consistent opposition to regulation of the multitrillion-dollar derivatives market are now widely blamed for causing the credit crisis. Under Greenspan's tenure the derivatives market went from barely registering to a $500 trillion industry, despite billionaire investor Warren Buffett warning that they were \"financial weapons of mass destruction\".</p> <p>His rock-bottom rates encouraged Americans to load up on debt to buy homes, even when they had no savings, no income and no job prospects.</p> <p>These so-called sub-prime borrowers were the cannon fodder for the biggest boom-bust in US history. The housing collapse brought the global economy to its knees.</p> <p>He was given an honorary knighthood in 2002 for his \"contribution to global economic stability\", but in 2008, at a Congressional hearing investigating the causes of the financial crisis, Greenspan finally admitted he \"made a mistake in presuming\" that financial firms could regulate themselves.</p> <p>\"You found that your view of the world, your ideology was not right, it was not working?\" Henry Waxman, the committee chairman, said.</p> <p>\"Absolutely, precisely,\" Greenspan replied. \"You know, that's precisely the reason I was shocked, because I have been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well.\"</p> <p>After he quit the Fed, in 2006, Greenspan joined Pimco, the world's largest bond investor, as a special consultant. Pimco's co-founder Bill Gross said Greenspan had helped make the firm \"billions of dollars'' in his role as a consultant.</p> <p>Gross said Greenspan's \"brilliance\" was a \"big money saver for us''. \"He's made and saved billions of dollars for Pimco already,'' Gross said in 2008.He has also advised Deutsche Bank and hedge fund billionaire John Paulson.</p> <p>Greenspan has also found time to criticise current Fed chairman Ben Bernanke's programme of quantitative easing. \"I've stayed away from commenting on Fed policy,\" he said on US TV earlier this month. \"I will say this, however, that the data do show that the expansion of assets has had very little impact on the economy, for an important reason, that we've created a major increase in the asset side of the Fed balance sheet and a very large trillion and a half increase in excess reserves.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394252632\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Business competitions/pictures/2009/1/26/1232967487331/Mervyn-King-001.jpg\" alt=\"Mervyn King\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mervyn King Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England</strong></p> <p>At his first meeting chairing the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) interest rates were cut to an historic postwar low of 3.5%. King's ambition as governor was to make the Bank \"boring\". If only that had been the case.</p> <p>He was slow to react to the crisis and initially refused to follow Greenspan in pumping cash into the system. The Treasury select committee (TSC) said he should have noticed that the housing bubble was becoming unstable and should have been \"more pro-active\" to damp it down.</p> <p>Just the other week King finally admitted that the financial crisis was the result of \"major mistakes\" by policymakers and not just the fault of greedy bankers.</p> <p>At the government's Global Investment Conference in London in the buildup to the Olympics he said: \"We saw this going into the crisis, we kept meeting at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but we did nothing to solve it collectively, and I don't think that this was a problem that could have been solved individually.\"</p> <p>More recently, King had to face the TSC to explain why the Bank failed to spot the Libor interest rate-fixing scandal that pre-dated the credit crunch and last month Bob Diamond stepped down as chief executive of Barclays after King let it be known Diamond no longer had the confidence of the Bank.</p> <p>In the shake-up of regulation that followed the financial meltdown, the governor of the Bank of England has emerged with more power than ever. However, King is due to stand down next summer, with former cabinet secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell and deputy governor Paul Tucker the favourites to replace him.</p> <h2>Politicians</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394252633\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Business competitions/pictures/2009/1/26/1232967669577/Bill-Clinton-001.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Clinton\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Clinton Photograph: Mary Altaffer/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mary Altaffer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Bill Clinton, former US president</strong></p> <p>Politicians' current plan to help prevent another financial crisis is to ringfence banks' risky \"casino banking\" divisions from the more pedestrian high street banking departments. 13 years ago Clinton repealed the Glass-Steagall Act, which had done just that.

  "<p>Nick Clegg's plan for constitutional reform and David Cameron's scheme to shift parliamentary boundaries in the Conservatives' favour both lay in ruins on Monday as victims of the prime minister's inability to persuade his backbenchers to support an elected House of Lords.</p> <p>A subdued and depressed Clegg announced he was abandoning all plans to reform the Lords in this parliament, adding as a result he will also be instructing his MPs to vote down revised parliamentary boundaries designed to reduce the number of MPs to 600.</p> <p>He claimed that to reduce the number of MPs whilst leaving the Lords unreformed would only strengthen the executive against parliament, an argument denounced as \"specious nonsense\" by Tory MPs.</p> <p>The announcement represents a personal blow to Clegg, who had championed widescale political reform as a distinctive Liberal Democrat contribution to the coalition but has been thwarted at virtually every turn.</p> <p>It leaves the deputy prime minister increasingly reliant on an upturn in the economy, progress on social mobility and a broader liberal agenda to justify the original decision to form the coalition with Cameron.</p> <p>A triumphant Labour party claimed announcement was a humiliation for the coalition, and a sign of the prime minister's weakness. Privately the party also added that the move sharply reduces the likelihood of a Conservative majority government at the next election, and makes the chances of the Lib Dems forming a second coalition government with the Conservatives increasingly remote.</p> <p>The boundary review might have seen as many as 40 Labour and Lib Dem seats abolished.</p> <p>Clegg himself accused the Conservatives of breaking the coalition contract, and said the failure of Labour to support a parliamentary timetable on Lords reform amounted to \"student politics\" and short-term opportunism.</p> <p>Clegg conceded that the decision \u2013 relayed to Cameron in a blunt phone call on Monday morning \u2013 represented uncharted territory in the coalition, and created a vacuum in the coalition's legislative programme.</p> <p>He said he wanted that vacuum to be filled by alternative measures either on further banking reform, social care or ways to help young people find jobs.</p> <p>Cameron refused to admit that reform of constituency boundaries \u2013 a proposal which was due to be voted on by MPs and peers next year \u2013 was dead, and said the vote would go ahead, raising the prospect of Lib Dem ministers voting against the prime minister in the division lobbies.</p> <p>Lib Dems said it would be more sensible if the still-incomplete boundary review was shelved now.</p> <p>It is possible that Cameron still sees the boundary revisions as a bargaining chip he can deploy against his Lib Dem colleagues. Tory cabinet members pointed out the coalition agreement had linked boundary reform to the referendum on the alternative vote, and not to Lords reform, but Clegg countered they were part of a cluster of constitutional measures.</p> <p>Clegg was eager on Monday to limit the damage from the collapse of Lords reform \u2013 insisting the government would still be anchored in the centre ground, and focused on delivering a revival of the economy, the reason the coalition agreement was made in the first place. He said a relationship of mutual trust and respect could be maintained with his partners.</p> <p>But he admitted that it was the first time either coalition party had not delivered not just on what they have committed to each other but also to the electorate. \"The Conservative party is not honouring the commitment to Lords reform and, as a result, part of our contract has now been broken,\" he said.</p> <p>Clegg said that the Tory repudiation of the coalition contract requires \"a balancing amendment\" to the coalition contract, represented by the Lib Dems' decision to defer the date on which boundary review was implemented until after the next election.</p> <p>The deputy prime minister argued: \"Clearly the coalition cannot function effectively when one side of the coalition is picking and choosing the bits of the coalition agreement it does and does not like, and ... Liberal Democrat MPs are bound by the entire agreement.\"</p> <p>He also rejected any plans for more limited Lords reform such as reducing the number of hereditary peers.</p> <p>George Osborne, the chancellor, significantly more than Clegg, sought to pin the blame for the collapse of Lords reform on Labour. \"We have not been able to proceed on Lords reform, frankly, because there is opposition in Parliament and the opportunism of the Labour party.\"</p> <p>Osborne said MPs would consider the matter of the boundary review next year and the government would \"cross any issues with the boundary vote when we get to them\".</p> <p>The chancellor insisted the coalition was strong and that the government would use the parliamentary time freed up by the withdrawal of the Lords plans to put forward proposals on jobs and growth.</p> <p>\"I think we have got to use this moment as an opportunity to focus 110% on the economy \u2013 which is what the country wants.\"</p> <p>One of the ringleaders of the 90-odd Tory rebels, Jesse Norman, said : \"I am very pleased that the government has decided to withdraw the Lords bill. It was a bad piece of legislation which would have undermined the constitution.</p> <p>\"The government has rightly said that the economy is the priority. But there is much the government could also do now to reform the Lords, including steps to reduce the numbers and remove those convicted of serious criminal offences.</p> <p>\"These reforms would be easy to implement, and would likely pass both Houses on a free vote.\"</p> <p>Clegg's remarks suggest such proposals will be rejected by the Liberal Democrats for fear they would semi-legitimise an unreformed Lords.</p> <p>Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice secretary, claimed it was \"outrageous\" for Clegg to blame Labour. Khan suggested it was the Conservatives who had \"never been serious about reform\".</p> <p>The Lib Dem MP Martin Horwood said the Conservatives \"had become the G4S of British politics\" and had \"failed to deliver.\"</p>",

The impact of the bombs was devastating on the two homes they struck. Fabricated concrete spilled across the street and a nine-year-old girl lay dismembered in the ruins.</p> <p>The first stronghold established by the Free Syrian Army (FSA) in the war-torn city of Aleppo had been hit by regime jets, in an attack that failed to take out the rebel leadership but instead killed nine members of a family in a nearby house.</p> <p>For the past week rebel fighters and leaders had been coming and going from the school, which they had commandeered in the city's north-east. They had brought prisoners there, built up a large arsenal of looted weapons on a lower floor and brazenly parked a tank and anti-aircraft gun outside.</p> <p>The regime troops that were engaged in pitched battles with guerillas barely one kilometre away probably knew where the poorly-disguised base was. The Syrian jets overhead certainly did.</p> <p>By nightfall only five bodies had been recovered. There was no hope for the other four, who rescuers were trying to dig out with their hands and basic tools.</p> <p>The rebel unit's bid to win the hearts and minds of nearby residents has not gone well, not helped perhaps by the brazen way in which they made the nature of their stronghold so obvious. On Sunday the group's commander was finalising details of a flyer he had prepared, outlining what steps his men would take to end the sense of paralysis that cripples Aleppo. Less than 24 hours later a large unexploded bomb from one of the jets lay on the steps of the schoolhouse and all the men inside were packing to leave to set up a new base.</p> <p>On nearby main roads mountains of household rubbish remains uncollected and order is yet to return to the city, more than a fortnight after the Free Syrian Army obtained a foothold.</p> <p>The reach of the guerilla force has since extended to what they claim is more than 60% of the city. But the rebels seem to be driven by little more than enthusiasm. Planning to hold their gains in the face of an imminent regime counter-assault is haphazard at best. Strategy seems anchored more in hope than vision.</p> <p>\"What can we do when all these so-called officers run away to Turkey and drink beer in refugee camps,\" said Major Abu Firad, who defected to the rebels six weeks ago and has insisted on a new rank of corporal in the unit with which he fights in the suburb of Salahedine.</p> <p>\"Every decision on the ground is up to us,\" he said. \"These officers who speak on the television from their comfortable camps over the border have no authority to speak for us. If they were real officers they would come back and fight.\"</p> <p>Salahedine is at the vanguard of the Free Syrian Army's defences. And on Monday the rebels there were weathering assaults from recently arrived loyalist units.</p> <p>\"They have brought in tank units from the Golan Heights,\" said Major Abu Firad. \"I know that because I was a tank commander and we can monitor their radio frequencies.\"</p> <p>Other key Syrian military units are also thought to have arrived on the city's southern outskirts and started readying for battle. Regime jets have returned to the countryside north of Aleppo, where rebels ousted loyalist forces in 10 days of fighting from 19 July.</p> <p>One Mig made at least eight bombing runs from 1am to 4am early on Monday over one of the towns below, causing panic among residents and resignation among others.</p> <p>\"They are trying to force the guys to come back to town to defend their families and leave Aleppo exposed,\" said a cleric, Sheikh Omar, in the town of al-Bab. \"But this fight is something that can't be avoided.\"</p> <p>Aleppo is proving to be harder going for regime forces than the capital Damascus, in which they were able to chase rebels from areas they had seized in July in less than 10 days.</p> <p>Despite large numbers of captured weapons, a constant stream of deserters coming their way, and news of high profile political defections, much of the rebel force acknowledges that their campaign has a long way to go.</p> <p>Rebels are continuing to reinforce positions in Aleppo. So too are loyalists. \"Around 20,000 moved into Aleppo [on Sunday night] said Major Abu Firad. \"They are planning to first take back this neighbourhood and then move into the rest of the city.\"</p> <p>Shells thundered into Salahedine, a middle-class neighbourhood of apartment buildings, throughout Monday. Guerillas there claimed to have captured three locals \u2013 thought to be the only residents to have remained there \u2013 whom they accuse of spying for the regime.</p> <p>As another rebel group left for the fight on Sunday night, a young student of Sharia law, who had joined the rebel ranks, urged the 30 men in front of him to treat prisoners well and not to harm civilians. \"We must be very clear about this. God has told us to behave with honour as warriors.\"</p> <p>The departing rebels in Aleppo had adopted different methods. Screams from some captives, particularly those thought to have been members of the loyalist Shabiha militia, have echoed throughout the night in recent days. Late on Monday one of the alleged spies was brought in, a terrified woman in her late 20s whose hair had been cut leaving unruly strips on an almost bald scalp.</p> <p>The residents wandering the streets near the schoolhouse hours before breaking their fast didn't seem to mind that the rebels were leaving.</p>",
  "<p>The pupils file in quietly class by class, the school hall lit from the front with five candles on a table. Soft music plays in the background and images of the pupils taken at various times of the year appear as a slideshow. It is the last assembly of the academic year at Tower Hill primary in Witney, Oxfordshire, and an opportunity for staff and children to reflect on the last 12 months.</p> <p>Brandon comes forward and tells the school how he learned to curb his anger. He now counts to 10 if someone has made him cross. Annie says pupils tend not to tell lies&#xa0;any more or try to \"get out of\" something they have done wrong. Alana&#xa0;says she is proud of the moment she persevered with a difficult task in class when it might have been easier just to give up.</p> <p>This school is located in the heart of David Cameron's Witney constituency in west Oxfordshire, but its philosophy is some way removed from the culture of change and competition brought to the system by Cameron's government via its education secretary. \"Michael Gove would consider our approach far too ephemeral and touchy-feely,\" says Tracey Smith, the headteacher. \"But we would like him to visit us, and will be extending an invitation, so he can see what we're achieving here in a stable, happy environment. It might do his public image a lot of good if he did not appear so rigid in his thinking.\"</p> <p>Tower Hill is one of a growing number of schools in the UK that have adopted <a href=\"http://www.values-education.com/\" title=\"\">values-based education</a>, a fast-growing movement set up by a former Oxfordshire headteacher, Neil Hawkes. The ethos embraces qualities such as respect, courage, honesty, compassion and integrity among the school community, underpinned by high expectations. Its proponents believe that this ethical vocabulary, which is used and understood even by the youngest children, creates the ideal environment for learning by promoting a peaceful and calm atmosphere.</p> <p>Hawkes, whose movement has grown to include more than 2,000 schools throughout the UK, 49 of which have received its \"quality mark\", says values-based education is spreading largely by word of mouth as schools recognise its effectiveness. \"It empowers them to produce good results because it builds character. When children use the vocabulary of ethics they gain confidence and self-respect, and respect for others. Maths and physics have a vocabulary and so should ethics. These are innate qualities we have as human beings, which need to be developed like all skills do.\" Some areas of the country have large clusters of schools using this idea, he says, including south Wales, Herefordshire and Bedfordshire.</p> <p>Just one year after arriving at Tower Hill, Smith is achieving remarkable results. Overall, 85% of the latest cohort of year 6s has achieved the benchmark level 4 score in national curriculum tests in English and mathematics, a rise from 65% last year. Nobody would describe Witney as a disadvantaged area but this school does not mainly serve the affluent \"Chipping Norton set\" or their like. In this school more than 30% of children are entitled to free school meals, against a national average of 19.3% in primary schools and an Oxfordshire average of 9.8%. A&#xa0;third of pupils here have special needs.</p> <p>But for Smith primary education is not about passing tests, though student progress is tracked regularly. \"We don't teach to the tests because we don't need to \u2013 the majority of our pupils will pass them anyway because they learn what they need to know through our creative approach,\" she says.</p> <p>Her application for the headship dropped on the mat at Tower Hill at a time when the school was improving after a difficult few years of mediocre results and falling rolls. At her previous school, a Church of England primary, Smith had&#xa0;introduced values-based learning because she felt uncomfortable preaching about ethics in a religious context. \"Values are not exclusive to Christianity but something everyone should aspire to,\" she says.</p> <p>Liam Walsh, the chair of governors, says: \"We had a strong field of candidates, but Tracey's application and interview stood out. We had not explicitly been looking for a values-based approach, but implicitly it appears that this was what was needed. The simplicity of the idea really struck a chord.\"</p> <p>The school's motto, Be the Best You Can, applies not only to the work done in&#xa0;the classroom, but also in staff and pupils' behaviour and their relationships with each other. The sentiment behind it was noted by the prime minister himself when he visited the school at the end of term. \"I have seen a very confident headteacher and a very confident team doing great things in this school to raise its profile and results and to make sure pupils are getting the education they deserve,\" he said.</p> <p>Yet this school faces uncertain times. The day before term ended, Oxfordshire county council sent out a letter to all primary heads saying it would assist any schools choosing to convert to an academy and that it supported the government's programme. The idea does not sit comfortably with Smith, but she knows that Tower Hill will have to consider it, should other schools begin to go down that route.</p> <p>In a school that promotes stability and calm it is a potential upheaval and worry that Smith feels it can do without. \"We seek to create an environment where children feel happy, secure and can thrive because this is the very foundation of good&#xa0;learning, so this is an unwelcome distraction,\" she says.</p> <p>Although the wellbeing of pupils is no longer inspected as part of the Ofsted process, inspectors are expected to take account of children's spiritual, moral, social and cultural development. \"The first 'value' we introduced was respect, which was the theme for most of the first term,\" recalls Louise Conroy, the teacher who, with the head, has led the implementation of values-based learning. She recalls a football match when Tower Hill players approached the other team at the end of the game with outstretched hands, which their opponents refused to shake because of a disputed goal. \"We saw then that our pupils had understood the concept of respect very quickly.\"</p> <p>At lunchtimes a family scenario is created in the dining hall with pupils and teachers sitting in groups and serving each other. No one eats before everyone has their food. \"It teaches them manners and creates an environment that some may not get at home,\" Smith says.</p> <p>It has become accepted practice in the classroom for pupils to comment openly on each other's work, through a system of&#xa0;peer assessment, and for teachers to make suggestions for improvement. Previously many children would have felt threatened or criticised by such an approach, but an atmosphere of openness now pervades.</p> <p>Trust and self-esteem have grown as children reflect on their learning as well as their own behaviour and that of others, and every day is seen as an opportunity to start again and to get right things that had previously gone wrong.</p> <p>\"We hope that if nothing else these methods will enhance their life chances,\" Smith adds. \"If they go into a university or job interview and show good manners then that will help them. We want these children to have the same opportunities as everyone else.</p> <p>\"A child has to be happy to come to school and learn effectively, and we spent a lot of time talking to children about what they want to learn.

Clegg twice mentioned his MPs had voted for deeply unpopular rises in tuition fees and reform of the NHS.</p> <p>Tories, for their part, claim that Lib Dems are betraying a promise to vote for the boundary review in return for being able to hold a national referendum on introducing a new alternative vote system last year.</p> <p>Linking the two separate constitutional changes was \"clever politics,\" said Tim Montgomerie, the influential editor of the Conservative Home news and comment website.</p> <p>\"There's no trust left in this coalition: they may be able to keep going, but it will be increasingly miserable for the next two to three years,\" said Montgomerie. \"The great thing at the beginning was the 'high trades' \u2026 big things in return for other big things. Now it's just protection of what we have, no further advance, no flexibility, no willingness to help each other out.\"</p> <p>Following pledges by all three major parties to reform the Lords at the last general election, the Electoral Reform Society said parliamentarians had \"squandered consensus, in the name of cheap point scoring and political games\".</p> <p>\"This isn't about the failure of one party, one government or one bill, but of politics itself,\" said Katie Ghose, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society. \"Each party has had an opportunity to break the impasse. Each party has chosen not to.\"</p> <p>The shadow justice secretary, Sadiq Khan, said the announcement showed a \"spectacular failure of leadership\" by the Tory leader and prime minister David Cameron.</p> <p>The announcement will be seen by some as a personal blow to the authority of Clegg, who has already seen the party's cherished hopes of voting reform defeated in last year's referendum, while he has asked his MPs to vote for bills deeply unpopular with Lib Dem supporters, including higher university tuition fees and the NHS shakeup.</p> <p>However, Lib Dem peer and former MP Lord Carlile told the BBC World at One programme: \"Nick Clegg is in a very strong position as leader of the Liberal Democrats, expected to lead us strongly into the election, so I don't believe any of the speculation about the threats to Nick Clegg's future.\"</p> <p>In an apparent reference to the business secretary, Vince Cable, or his supporters, Carlile added: \"And I believe senior Liberal Democrats should stop posturing about the leadership.\"</p> <p>Clegg also held out hope to his party activists and other supporters of Lords reform, saying \"My hope is that we will return to it in the next parliament\" after 2015.</p> <p>The coalition agreement included a pledge to bring forward legislation to reform the House of Lords, one of the Lib Dems' unbreachable requirements of a deal to govern together.</p> <p>In July, MPs voted by a large majority in favour of the bill, but the government was forced to drop another crucial vote on the parliamentary timetable after more than 100 Tory backbenchers and the Labour party signalled they would vote against it. Clegg said he agreed to Cameron's request for more time to persuade his backbenchers, but that the prime minister had since told him that he could not do so.</p> <p>This would have made it all but impossible for the government to get a final vote on the proposals for Lords to be elected for single 15-year terms, while using up much of the parliamentary timetable over the next three years, said Clegg.</p> <p>\"It is obvious that the bill's opponents would now seek to inflict on it a slow death: ensuring Lords reform consumes an unacceptable amount of parliamentary time,\" said Clegg. \"Clearly it would be wrong for me to allow parliament to be manipulated in this way, not least at a time when there is so much else for us to concentrate on.\"</p> <p>Defending the importance that Lib Dems had put on the changes, Clegg said: \"An unelected House of Lords flies in the face of democratic principles and public opinion. It makes a mockery of our claim to be the mother of all democracies.\"</p> <p>The Lib Dem leader revealed he had offered the Tory leader David Cameron a compromise, under which there would be a referendum on Lords reform at the next general election in 2015, after which the changes to both Lords and the boundaries would take place in 2020 \u2013 but it was rejected.</p> <p>Clegg also defended his decision to link Lords reform to the boundary review, for which final proposals were due this autumn, as \"both part of a package\" arguing that one without the other would create an \"imbalance\" in the political system. \"If you cut the number of MPs without enhancing the legitimacy and effectiveness of the Lords, all you have done is weaken parliament as a whole, strengthen the executive and it's over-mighty government that wins,\" he said.</p> <p>Khan said Labour \"remained committed\" to Lords reform in principle, adding: \"That is why we took the unprecedented decision of voting for the bill in the House of Commons despite some serious reservations about the legislation. And why we gave a commitment to support the bill in progressing from the Commons to the House of Lords. In contrast, 91 Tories voted against their own manifesto commitment.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ian Renton is to return to Cheltenham after an absence of nearly 25 years when taking over as managing director at the home of jump racing in October. Formerly assistant manager to Edward Gillespie at the track between 1985 and 1988, Renton has been named as the successor to Gillespie by Cheltenham's owners, Jockey Club Racecourses.</p> <p>However, the appointment could herald a spell of musical chairs among the senior management teams of some of Britain's biggest racecourses.</p> <p>Under a restructuring of the management of their 14 tracks, Renton, currently serving as manager of the Arena racecourse group, will become one of four regional directors. As well as Cheltenham, Renton will have responsibility for Exeter, Warwick and Wincanton.</p> <p>Newmarket's boss, Amy Starkey, becomes regional director for Huntingdon, Market Rasen, Newmarket and Nottingham, while Rupert Trevelyan assumes overall control of Epsom, Sandown and Kempton.</p> <p>John Baker, a former manager of Carlisle, also returns to racecourse management,in charge of the north-west region, comprising Aintree, Carlisle and Haydock.</p> <p>Baker described the move as \"a homecoming\", saying: \"I know it sounds cliched but if my granddad hadn't sat me down in front of the 1973 Grand National to watch Red Rum win, I wouldn't be interested in horse racing. This is a great move and a great personal thrill.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, a suggestion that Great Leighs racecourse might benefit from the expected closure of Folkestone at the end of this year was dismissed by a spokesman at the British Horseracing Authority. The track's chairman, Keith Brown, was quoted in a local newspaper as saying he had approached the sport's ruling body with an offer \"to fill the gap in the south that will be brought about by the closure of one of the regions racecourses\".</p> <p>The BHA's man pointed out that the problem for Great Leighs was not a lack of fixtures but the fact that the track has not been granted a licence to race in 2013, for reasons that have not been specified.</p>",
  "<p>It's never the ones you expect, a wise former head of HR once told me: never the seemingly unambitious or semi-detached who quit to see more of their children. It's the alpha females, the ones who couldn't bear not to shine at everything, couldn't stand the inevitable domestic and professional compromises.</p> <p>So perhaps it's not so surprising that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/06/mp-louise-mensch-resigns-family?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Louise Mensch</a> is joining the ranks of the disappeared, those political parents leaving to spend more time with the family, alongside <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/24/ruthkelly.labour\" title=\"\">Ruth Kelly</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/jun/12/health.politics\" title=\"\">Alan Milburn</a> (for yes, men occasionally do this too). But to react by trampling over the old familiar turf \u2013 can parents really cut it at the top, shouldn't Commons working hours be changed? \u2013 somehow feels like missing the point.</p> <p>Like almost everything she does, Mensch's resignation divides opinion.<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9455712/Louise-Mensch-resignation-Cameron-has-a-hard-by-election-fight-ahead.html\" title=\"\"> Tories will be exasperated</a> at having to fight a byelection in a recession; Labour thrilled that Corby's slender majority is there for the taking. Those who feel she shouldn't have entered the kitchen if she couldn't stand a full five years of heat are furious: among parents, there is variously dismay at another high-flyer biting the dust, sympathy from the equally agonised, and resentment from those who can't afford to quit.</p> <p>But love Mensch or hate her, don't buy the line that she merely got bored and flounced: for whatever else she achieved in politics, she was never exactly stuck for ways to make it interesting. And the lesson I learned three years ago, when I quit my own job as the Observer's political editor and began interviewing other parents who had made similar decisions, is that these things are rarely as simple as they seem.</p> <p>I don't doubt Mensch was genuinely torn. She has felt her responsibility to her three children fiercely, particularly since her divorce from their father, stretching herself thin to be the kind of mother she felt she should be. Unusually for an MP, she chose not to have a full-time nanny, but to work from home as often as possible instead (a tactic revealed when she infamously left a select committee interrogation of Rupert Murdoch early to do the school run).</p> <p>And while she knew when she was selected what the job would entail, her home life has become infinitely more complicated since then. She and her husband separated three years after she became Corby's candidate, and although she recently remarried, her new husband lives in the US. While many Westminster parents face painful choices over where the family belongs (school the children in the constituency and you won't see the family all week: in the capital, and the constituency association may bitterly complain), Mensch was ricocheting in a demented triangle between London, Corby and New York.</p> <p>No wonder she made her name on Twitter, not in the chamber: working parents are blissfully weightless on social media, since you can tweet anywhere \u2013 children on your lap if necessary \u2013 with nobody the wiser.</p> <p>But it probably couldn't work for ever, and now it hasn't. She's made her choice, one perhaps as much to do with marriage as with motherhood: not for her the dutiful spouse, picking up domestic pieces and opening church fetes in her absence, without whom many more political careers would founder.</p> <p>It's fair to wonder, of course, quite how satisfying her career had become. The ambitious working mother's exit often conceals reservations about the next step up the ladder, which help tip the balance towards the eternal guilt about the children.</p> <p>For all those glitzy photo spreads, Mensch was never less than serious about politics and fancied a shot at the right department (though one somehow can't see her grinding away in obscurity as a junior Defra minister). But she must have known the juggling act would only intensify had she become a minister \u2013 and that on the Tories' polling numbers, MPs in marginal seats risk oblivion in 2015. Was it really worth another three years of frantic juggling, only to be left with nothing to show for it?</p> <p>So with hindsight, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/19/lousie-mensch-rival-twitter\" title=\"\">the social media business she recently established in the US</a> looks like an escape route: and whether or not it succeeds, I doubt she'll sit around making cupcakes. The chicklit novelist who reinvented herself as a politician is quite capable of reinventing herself again.</p> <p>As for the hoary old question of what this means for the work-life balance debate, Mensch herself is quite clear: nothing. She has rather admirably declined to have her personal choice turned into propaganda for the \"told you mothers can't hack it\" brigade, telling her local paper that another woman might well have managed but she simply decided not to.</p> <p>She's right to say that what suits one parent cannot be assumed to suit all others. But she's particularly right because her own circumstances \u2013 the transatlantic marriage of two wealthy professionals in unusually all-consuming jobs \u2013 bear almost no relation to those of the average working mother, struggling to pay the nursery bills.</p> <p>So Mensch is best remembered not as the poster girl for not-having-it-all but as simply as a law unto herself: the politician who thwarted a tabloid expos\u00e9 of past drug-taking by happily suggesting they didn't know the half of it; the outspoken Tory feminist when the F-word was still taboo in her party. Politics will be duller without her. But perhaps now we can talk about the unglamorous childcare challenges that matter.</p> <p><em>Gaby Hinsliff is a former political editor of the Observer</em></p>",
  "<p>Syria's prime minister on Monday became the most high-profile political figure to quit the regime of Bashar al-Assad \u2013 a propaganda coup for the opposition as the country's crisis continued to escalate.</p> <p>News of Riyad Hijab's dramatic move broke shortly after a bomb blast hit state TV in the centre of Damascus and reports from the northern city of Aleppo pointed to an imminent government offensive.</p> <p>The first stronghold established by the Free Syrian Army (FSA) in Aleppo was also hit by government aircraft in an attack that killed nine members of a family in a nearby house and forced the rebel fighters to move to a new base in the city.</p> <p>In Damascus, the FSA, the opposition's main armed wing, threatened to kill 45 Iranian pilgrims it had kidnapped, claiming they were Iranian Revolutionary Guards who were helping the Syrian regime crush unrest.</p> <p>Hijab is the most senior civilian politician to defect since the uprising against Assad began 17 months ago. \"I announce that I am from today a soldier in this blessed revolution,\" he said in a statement issued in his name in the Jordanian capital Amman. Opposition supporters hailed the news as damaging to the regime but there was little sense that it would quickly alter the balance of forces inside Syria.</p> <p>Later Hijab was reported to be heading for the Gulf state of Qatar, an outspoken supporter of the Syrian opposition, to avoid embarrassing Jordan.</p> <p>The defection is a PR defeat for Assad, but not necessarily one that will have a major impact on the running of the regime. Real power remains with Assad and the coterie of military and security chiefs and relatives who surround him.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/18/syria-rebels-kill-elite-damascus\" title=\"\">killing of four of Assad's top security chiefs</a> last month \u2013 including his brother-in-law Assef Shawkat \u2013 was a far more devastating blow. Hijab, a former minister who had a reputation as a loyal Ba'athist, was only appointed in June after widely boycotted parliamentary elections.</p> <p>\"It's humiliating and shows that Assad doesn't know any more on whom he can count,\" said Rime Allaf, a Syrian analyst at London's Chatham House thinktank. An exiled opposition activist dismissed it as a \"PR blow, nothing more\". But Hassan Abdel-Azim, head of the opposition national co-ordination bureau in Damascus, called it a \"qualitative shift\".</p> <p>Hijab's defection certainly undermines the regime's ability to convey the impression that everything is under control as it battles what it calls \"armed terrorist gangs\" supported by what it says is a western-Arab conspiracy.</p> <p>It suggests too that the ubiquitous Mukhabarat secret police is failing. \"Syrian governments have always been a facade for what is actually an intelligence-run structure,\" an activist of the local co-ordination committees told the Guardian.</p> <p>In Washington a White House spokesman claimed it was evidence that the regime was \"crumbling from within\".</p> <p>It was telling that once rumours of Hijab's arrival in Jordan began to circulate, Syrian state media announced his \"resignation\" without offering further details. It is telling, too, that he is reported to have been accompanied by 10 members of his family, who would have faced retribution if they had remained in Syria.</p> <p>State media said he was replaced by his deputy, Omar Ghalawanji, who immediately pledged to confront the \"conspiracies\" facing the country.</p> <p>Hijab, a Sunni Muslim from Deir al-Zour, may have been influenced by rising anti-regime sentiment in his home area, near the border with Iraq. Nawaf al-Fares, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/12/syrian-regime-must-be-ousted-nawaf-al-fares\" title=\"\">Syria's ambassador to Iraq and the most senior diplomat to defect</a>, is also from there. Like the defection of Manaf Tlass, a brigadier general in the elite Republican Guard, Hijab's move will trigger speculation about others who may follow.</p> <p>Hijab's spokesman said the defection had been co-ordinated with the FSA over the two months since his appointment. That suggests there is truth to claims that the rebels have cultivated significant figures within the regime whose departure may eventually help bring it down.</p> <p>Opposition sources also announced the defection of Ya'aroub al-Shar'a, described as head of information for political security \u2013 one of Syria's intelligence agencies. But the loyalist al-Dunya TV said Shar'a, a nephew of vice-president Farouq al-Shara'a in fact worked in the statistics section of the traffic department.</p> <p>An FSA spokesman said that three of the 48 Iranians it has been holding in Damascus since Saturday had been killed in shelling by government forces and threatened to execute the remaining 45 unless the firing stopped. Tehran insists that they are all bona fide pilgrims and has asked Qatar and Turkey to intervene.</p> <p>\"The tightening of the regime circle even more closely around the Assads resembles the beginning of the end of the Gaddafi regime in Libya,\" said IHS Jane's Middle East analyst, David Hartwell. \"Although the dynamics in Syria are very different, Damascus will face the same problem of trying to explain away the desertion of senior government officials at the same time as trying to claim that its rule remains unchanged. The perception that the Syrian regime is on its last legs has now never been stronger and it is likely that other senior political and military figures in the country are asking themselves how much longer they will either be party to or allow the fighting to continue.\"</p>",
  "<p>The banners, T-shirts and handwritten posters said it all. \"China! Hands off Vietnam!\" read one. \"Shame on you, bastard neighbour,\" said another. \"Stop escalating, invading the East Sea of Vietnam,\" a third declared.</p> <p>As the protesters weaved their way through the crowded streets of Hanoi, past the peeling colonial villas and upmarket shops selling stereos and Versace, they charged towards the Chinese embassy, where they hoped to make a stand against what they call \"China's constant aggression\".</p> <p>\"I hate China!\" said one fortysomething protester, his voice hoarse from shouting slogans. \"Germany invaded Poland during the second world war, now China wants to do the same to Vietnam. History may repeat itself if the international community is not made aware of China's bullying.\"</p> <p>From government offices to the streets of Vietnam, tensions between Beijing and Hanoi have mounted in recent weeks over what China calls the South China Sea and Vietnam the East Sea, an area where vast deposits of oil and gas, important international shipping routes and fishing rights are of interest not just to Beijing and Hanoi, but also to the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei.</p> <p>But last month's <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/22/vietnamese-protesters-chinese-aggression\" title=\"\">protesters had only China on their mind</a>. After detaining a group of Vietnamese fishermen near disputed islands this year, Beijing announced that the state-backed China National Offshore Oil Corporation was seeking bids for oil exploration in what Vietnam deems its own sovereign waters.</p> <p>It also declared Sansha City \u2013 on tiny Yongxing in the Paracel islands, which Vietnam lays claim to \u2013 China's newest municipality. The anti-China protest was the third of its kind in Hanoi in one month. \"The territorial ambition of China is a common threat \u2013 not only for the Philippines or Vietnam but for countries all over the world,\" said leading economist Le Dang Doanh, a former government adviser who recently signed an <a href=\"http://eyedrd.org/2012/05/vietnamese-intelligentsia-supports-the-philippines-in-scarborough-shoal-standoff.html\" title=\"\">open letter </a>calling for China to abandon its \"absurd maritime claims\" in the region. \"China's territorial claims are now bigger than China itself.\"</p> <p>Hanoi, 125 miles from the Chinese border, knows it must play a delicate game. Trade between the two countries reached an estimated $40bn last year, and analysts say that ties between the authoritarian, one-party states are considerably closer than either government would like to admit.</p> <p>The seeming standoff has pushed the US into the game, with recent visits by the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, and the defence secretary, Leon Panetta, highlighting America's interest in its former foe. Panetta's visit to Cam Ranh bay, a US naval base during the Vietnam war, sparked particular curiosity over the US's intentions to \"protect key maritime rights for all nations in the South China Sea\" as it moves to deploy 60% of its naval ships to the Pacific by 2020.</p> <p>Carlyle Thayer, a Vietnam expert at the Australian defence academy, said Vietnam was likely to maintain its sovereignty by co-operating \u2013 but not aligning itself \u2013 with the US, but warned the situation in the South China Sea could worsen before it improved. \"Most likely an incident will occur from a misadventure of two opposite boats trying to be in the same place at the same time,\" he said. \"At the moment there's enough control [on both sides] but the analysis is that a lot of China's agencies are acting independently, and the central government is having a hard time asserting authority \u2026 the problem is that [neither country's] crisis management techniques are very good.\"</p> <p>The protests in Hanoi come at a time of uncertainty over Vietnam's political and social future. Its economy has followed a remarkable trajectory from colonialism and communism through to the <em>doi-moi</em> (\"socialist-oriented market economy\") capitalism of the 1990s and beyond. Art-deco villas have been razed for multi-storey office blocks, and gaudy mansions dwarf the shady avenues of Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, where men in slacks and women in short shorts and stilettos skittle past in glossy Mercedes and 4x4 BMWs.</p> <p>Here, the rich have become so rich that a Vietnamese businessman <a href=\"http://www.live-pr.com/en/williams-amp-williams-sells-smallest-town-r1049427156.htm\" title=\"\">recently purchased an entire American town</a> for sale in Wyoming. But Vietnam is running a huge trade deficit with China ($1.85bn in the first two months of the year alone) and its three million-member Communist party is struggling to maintain control over its population of 90 million, 70% of whom were born after 1975, and one-third of whom have internet access.</p> <p>Protesters are not just angry about China's territorial ambitions, but about the gaping rich-poor divide, increasing accounts of police brutality, widening crackdowns on dissent, and growing numbers of land evictions and human rights abuses. Reporters without Borders declared Vietnam an \"enemy of the internet\" as a decree aimed at making it illegal to post anonymously online means that bloggers particularly are under attack. Facebook is blocked, as are many blogs, and activists claim emails, phone calls and whereabouts are routinely monitored. The <a href=\"http://cpj.org/\" title=\"\">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> cites Vietnam as the fourth-worst jailer of journalists in the world. \"Vietnam really is the new Burma,\" said Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>\"We're seeing more of a crackdown on freedom of expression, a growing lawlessness in terms of the way police interact with people, a continued effort to go after prominent bloggers, to identify activists and jail dissidents. They're trying to prevent any Arab spring-type event where a mixture of information on the internet combined with people being angry and protesting ignites into something more. It's very embarrassing for Vietnam, because previously they were the influential ones giving advice to Burma, which was the basket-case.\"</p> <p>Now that Burma is no longer a pariah \u2014 thanks to the election of Aung San Suu Kyi to parliament and a slew of reforms initiated by reformist President Thein Sein \u2014 the shining star that was once Vietnam has waned considerably, says one local analyst. \"Foreign direct investment is flowing into Burma and declining in Vietnam. The government knows it is losing credibility. Vietnam allowed its private sector to develop, but it did not reform its political system. It was a fatal mistake.\"</p> <p>Dissident lawyer Le Quoc Quan, one of Vietnam's most prominent human rights activists who has been repeatedly jailed and beaten for his democracy efforts, said Vietnam was fighting a losing battle. \"More people know more about their rights, so the more they fight for their rights, [the] more repression, more arrests,\" he said. \"But an optimistic sign is that people are not afraid.\"</p> <p>While it is hoped a diplomatic resolution over the South China Sea will soon be reached \u2013 the Association of Southeast Nations agreed last week to a \"code of conduct\" that may see negotiations begin with China in September \u2013 it is just as likely that tension will continue. \"The problem of China and Vietnam has been a problem for 2,000 years,\" says Le Dang Doanh. \"If China keeps up the aggression, one million [Vietnamese] will take to the streets to protest. You'll see.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 August 2012. The original said that the USA will be moving 60% of its naval ships to the Pacific by 2020 rather than 10% more, ie the deployment ratio will be 40% of the fleet in the Atlantic and 60% in the Pacific.</p>",

  "<p>A furniture store that was badly damaged during last year's riots has been covered in more than 4,000 images of young people holding positive statements to mark the one-year anniversary of the disturbances.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/video/2011/aug/09/london-riots-croydon-reeves-video\" title=\"\">burned-out remains of the House of Reeves</a> store in Croydon, south London, became one of the most evocative images of the unrest after rioters broke in and set fire to the building, which had stood on the same site for more than 140 years.</p> <p>On Monday refurbished section of the store was decked out with pictures of youngsters holding cards with hopeful messages for their local community and the wider society.</p> <p>The furniture store's co-owner Trevor Reeves, 57, and his father, Maurice, were present for the event.</p> <p>\"The positive legacy of the riots was the coming together of people of all ages and from all walks of life to help mend the capital,\" said Trevor. \"We were overwhelmed by the support that was offered to our family and many others affected in the days and weeks that followed.\"</p> <p>He said the country was \"blessed\" with so many bright, inspirational and positive young people. \"It's important that we don't allow the actions of such a few to cloud our judgment of the many,\" he said.</p> <p>The project was organised by youth volunteering charity vInspired as part of its Reverse Riots campaign and has drawn support from leading politicians, including David Cameron and Tottenham MP David Lammy.</p> <p>Cameron said: \"It's important to give all young people the chance to become involved in their community and do something positive, so I wish vInspired every success in their campaign.\"</p> <p>Lammy said it was \"too easy\" to blame all the UK's young people. \"We must remember that this was the actions of the minority. The majority of young people are law abiding, brilliant representatives of this country.\" He added: \"As we have seen with the legacy provided by the Olympic Games, young people are the future of this nation and we must stand tall and side by side with them to allow them to flourish.\"</p> <p>London mayor Boris Johnson said the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/series/reading-the-riots\" title=\"\">disorder that spread across English cities</a> last August had revealed \"a deep social problem\" that required \"lots of different solutions\".</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said there was a culture of \"easy gratification and entitlement\" that had to be dealt with.</p> <p>Johnson added: \"I think actually the Olympics \u2013 with this very, very clear message about effort and achievement and what it takes to connect the two \u2013 could not come at a better time for a country that is making a difficult psychological adjustment to a new world without easy credit, where life is, I'm afraid, considerably tougher than it was before the crunch.\"</p> <p>Communities secretary Eric Pickles said the chances of further large-scale disturbances were now \"slightly less likely\" after communities had shown they wanted to take back their streets, but said nobody was complacent.</p> <p>\"This was about straightforward thievery.

  "<p>The coal mines that dotted this corner of eastern Belgium, Holland and the northern Ruhr were once photographed in all their melancholy grandeur, un-peopled and under flat skies, by <a href=\"http://catalog.manifesta9.org/nl/becher-bernd-hilla/\" title=\"\">Bernd and Hilla Becher</a>. Now this place is home to <a href=\"http://manifesta9.org/en/home/\" title=\"\">Manifesta, the ninth edition of the roving European Biennial of Contemporary Art</a>. I walk along a bleak corridor on the top floor of a dilapidated building, to a crisscrossing rhythm of unseen hammers, beating on anvils. There is a metallic tang in the air, dry on the palate. Little windows in the walls give glimpses of an empty landscape with a distant, grass-covered slagheap. A now-defunct railway leads over a viaduct to an abandoned pit-head. Just as the Bechers fussed with their camera, waiting for the right windless and deserted moment, I wait at the window.</p> <p>The hammers beat on. This building was once the headquarters of the Andr\u00e9 Dumont mine in Genk, in the Limburg region of Belgium. The mine ceased work in 1987; the building itself was completed in 1924, a handsome example of art deco industrial architecture.The smell in the corridor, says the artist Oswaldo Maci\u00e1, who worked with perfumer Ricardo Moya, is meant to evoke failure. Like many of the works here, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-GcTy6rZCE\" title=\"\">Martinete (Maci\u00e1's \"audio olfactory composition\")</a> is a kind of elegy. The legacies of the industrial revolution, the migration of labour and the geopolitics of Europe and beyond are Manifesta's theme: the world as it was and what it is becoming.</p> <p>The exhibition takes us from the fossilised head of an iguanodon, discovered during mining, to an engraving of <a href=\"http://catalog.manifesta9.org/en/coalbrook-dale/\" title=\"\">the ironworks at Coalbrookdale in Shropshire</a> at the beginning of the industrial revolution. It takes us from <a href=\"http://catalog.manifesta9.org/en/burian-zdenek/\" title=\"\">reimagined scenes of the carboniferous forests, with giant horsetails, ferns and giant dragonflies</a>, to <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/19436035\" title=\"\">Duncan Campbell's film of John DeLorean's attempt to build his futuristic gull-wing car in Northern Ireland</a>. On the way, we pass through <a href=\"http://catalog.manifesta9.org/en/martin-john/\" title=\"\">John Martin's subterranean illustrations of Milton's Hell</a>, meet the <a href=\"http://www.ashingtongroup.co.uk/artists1.html\" title=\"\">Ashington Group of pitman artists</a> (whose story has become the subject of both a play and a musical), and <a href=\"http://catalog.manifesta9.org/en/stakhanovism/\" title=\"\">quota-breaking Russian miner Alexey Stakhanov, poster-boy of Stalin's Russia</a>.</p> <p>Small stories and larger histories, piles of coal and fragments of lives fill The Deep of the Modern, as this exhibition is subtitled. There are photographs of the 1984 miners' strike by Guardian photographers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/newsroom/story/0,11718,1147687,00.html\" title=\"\">Denis Thorpe</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/slideshow/page/0,,2043336,00.html\" title=\"\">Don McPhee</a>; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRgaXib0Sc\" title=\"\">Jeremy Deller and Mike Figgis's re-enactment of the Battle of Orgreave</a>, and a documentary about the shooting of Belgian miners during a&#xa0;1966 strike. With real lives and history, artworks and ephemera, mining engineering and Marcel Duchamp, this is, quite deliberately, a move away from the biennials we are accustomed to.</p> <p>This Manifesta is a rejoinder to the malaise besetting many ambitious international art events, which its chief curator, Cuauht\u00e9moc Medina, pithily itemises: the feeling that there isn't time to see things properly, the despair of participants and audiences alike, the curatorial egomania and opaque themes, the homogenisation of different cultural practices, the \"usual suspect\" artists.</p> <p>While biennials invariably take some account of their places and its contexts, Medina and his team try to do it better. Past Manifestas have filled venues across San Sebasti\u00e1n in Spain's Basque country, based one in the Trentino valley in Italy's south Tyrol, and attempted cultural reconciliation in divided Cyprus (a disaster). The Deep of the Modern fills a&#xa0;single building and can be seen in a day. The sense of context is inescapable. Another Manifesta co-curator, Katerina Gregos, examines the ongoing&#xa0;economic crisis, describing how the majority of us \"will experience grave social and economic circumstances in years to come\". She continues: \"One thing is for sure: we will not be able to eat our iPhones or find comfort on Facebook unless there is a fundamental move away from the complacency for which we are responsible.\"</p> <p>The challenge is overwhelming, so we are left with our encounters with individual things, some of which are rich in ways we might not expect. A collection of samplers that once decorated mine-worker's homes in Genk are embroidered with homilies. \"Even though you are in love, you always need to eat,\" says one. \"Be careful with fire, coal is expensive,\" reads another. And here's an old, battered photographic portrait of a young Greek couple, Spyros and Polyxeni; when Spyros left Greece to work the mines in Limburg, they tore the photograph in two and he took the half depicting his wife to Belgium. When she later joined him in Genk, carrying the other half of the portrait, they sewed the image back together. It is a small family memento, but deeply telling.</p> <p>Thousands of Greeks, Turks and Italians came here to work in the mines. Their communities are still here though the mines have gone. Now I am listening to Rocco Granata, son of an Italian, who bought his family to Genk when the boy was 10. Rocco briefly worked in the mine but became a singer, and his international hit, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wXiJgCRH4Y\" title=\"\">Marina</a>, recorded in 1959, drifts through a lower gallery. Sound is everywhere: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/whauden\" title=\"\">WH Auden</a> reading his verse to Britten's score for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7yExWQQjRw\" title=\"\">the 1935 film Coal Face</a>; the thwack of a stick beating <a href=\"http://catalog.manifesta9.org/en/furlan-tomaz/\" title=\"\">Toma\u017e Furlan</a> on the back of his head, in a video that shows him \"operating\" his machines wearing gimcrack industrial prosthetics. The Slovenian sculptor is an heir to Keaton and Chaplin, or even Norman Wisdom, a mechanised man who won't fit the bill. He'd probably even hurt himself clocking-in.</p> <p>There's humour and absurdity here. I turn the tiny handle of a musical-box mechanism that tinkles out the tune of the Internationale, little knowing that the sound is relayed to speakers on the forecourt outside, the tune forlorn amid the birdsong and the decaying buildings, in Croatian artist Nemanja Cvijanovi\u0107's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KmDeIIgPc\" title=\"\">Monument to the Memory of the Idea of the Internationale</a>.</p> <p>In a video by Mikhail Karikis and Uriel Orlow, a choir of former Kent miners stand in a field, singing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJEcA3rUOnM\" title=\"\">Sounds from Beneath</a>, a recreation of remembered noises of the pit. They shush and roar and hiss. And here's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/aug/09/john-coltrane-giant-step\" title=\"\">John Coltrane</a>, blasting from David Hammons's 1989 <a href=\"http://www.smak.be/collectie_kunstenaar.php?la=en&amp;id=&amp;i=0&amp;t=&amp;tid=&amp;y=&amp;l=a&amp;kunstenaar_id=286&amp;kunstwerk_id=461\" title=\"\">Chasing the Blue Train</a>, a landscape of piano lids, some upright, others prone on the floor. Toy train tracks wend their way between the piano lids \u2013 like hills and plains and the curves of a woman's body \u2013 to disappear into a tunnel of coal. The little blue train sits stalled on the track. Hammons's work sucks other sculptures around it into its own landscape. Far across the floor are three little conical mountains of coal, topped by the Belgian flag, by Marcel Broodthaers. And nearby <a href=\"http://www.depont.nl/en/collection/artists/artist/werk_id/251/kunstenaar/long/\" title=\"\">Richard Long's 1992 line of Bolivian coal</a> runs the length of the gallery, and <a href=\"http://catalog.manifesta9.org/en/venet-bernar/\" title=\"\">Bernar Venet's 1963 indeterminate mound of coal</a>, is a black island rising from the concrete.

  "<p>He <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/liberaldemocrats/9245903/Local-elections-Nick-Clegg-is-sad-about-result-which-threatens-partys-grass-roots-future.html\" title=\"\">described himself as sad</a> after his dire local elections, but Nick Clegg looks considerably sadder today. The deputy prime minister could handle the slings and arrows of misfortune at the ballot box for as long as he could pass what his inner circle refer to as \"the mirror test\". Even if Clegg convinces few others these days, he could at least look his own reflection in the eye and believe that by 2015 he would leave a liberal imprint on Britain. Now that he has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/06/nick-clegg-blocks-boundary-changes\" title=\"\">given up on his cherished plan for Lords reform</a>, he would have to be deluded to retain this faith in himself.</p> <p>The reform was, as Clegg is suddenly keen to point out, never the most pressing thing on the mind of the swing voter in Wolverhampton. But it did have a very particular place in the Liberal Democrat heart, both because the ermine-trimmed anachronism that still co-writes Britain's law offends the party's modernity and rationalism, and because great Liberal heroes moved heaven and earth to reform the chamber a century ago. If Clegg had managed to complete the democratisation of parliament, he might just have redeemed his place in the party's history books. Now that he has folded, he will not join the likes of Asquith and Lloyd George in the pantheon, but will be bracketed with the forgotten establishment figures of the interwar <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberal_Party_%28UK,_1922%29\" title=\"\">National Liberals</a>.</p> <p>If the brief moment of Cleggmania during the general election campaign was about one thing, it was the sense that the third political force stood for a new way of running the country \u2013 something the Guardian described as \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/politics-and-reform\" title=\"\">a new politics</a>\". Some part of that promise carried over into the first days of the coalition, when the management of the Commons was overhauled to strengthen the hands of backbenchers. But the agenda failed its first serious test in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/may/06/av-over-yes-campaign-routed\" title=\"\">defeated AV referendum</a>, and now it has failed on the Lords too. The old politics of vested partisan interest has reasserted itself with a vengeance. Clegg's rhetoric today railed against it as usual, but the substance of what he had to say implicated him in the same sin.</p> <p>He previously supported new equal-sized constituencies on principle, but is now to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/06/nick-clegg-blocks-boundary-changes?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=feed\" title=\"\">vote against them</a> because they would advantage the Conservatives. He claimed that voters are always renegotiating contracts in day-to-day life (what sort of voters he has in mind, I'm not sure) and so will understand that the Tories' failure to deliver for him required the about-turn. Voters may not care, but every lobby correspondent knows that his crude aim is to save Lib Dem seats such as Lewes, which would otherwise have been wiped out. The resulting air of hypocrisy will taint Clegg for years to come.</p> <p>The deputy prime minister points the finger at Labour manoeuvring against the government's timetable for Lords reform for its demise. Of course the opposition was opportunistic, but that is what oppositions do. In hunting for the culprit, I'm afraid Clegg needs to take Michael Jackson's advice and start with the man in the mirror. For months, if not years, constitutional experts have been warning him that Lords reform faced all sorts of serious obstacles, but he did not listen to their demand for a strategy until it was too late. Until recently, he was brazenly assuring the backbenches that David Cameron could be counted on to force it through. He has mismanaged this great political project, just as he previously blundered over both student fees and NHS reforms, in both cases turning tricky political situations for his party into outright disaster. Clegg was only elected to the Commons in 2005, but the longer his leadership of his party goes on, the more it appears that he was too inexperienced for the job.</p> <p>But today's real lesson is that \u2013 however much you call a government \"progressive\" \u2013 it will not achieve meaningful political reform when it is led by the party of the establishment. Cameron reneged on his private promise to even-handedness in the AV referendum last year, and now he has reneged on his promise to deliver Clegg's reform. The parliamentary arithmetic made a rainbow coalition of centre-left forces difficult in 2010, but had it happened a reformed Lords would very likely already have happened.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats need to give some urgent thought to that. Much has gone wrong since they jumped into bed with the Conservatives, and it is time for the party to ask itself some pretty searching questions about what it has actually got out of an arrangement that it continues to prop up. Sensing that these questions are coming, at his press conference today, Clegg made a weird lurch into listing all the things in politics that continue to motivate him. He rattled off a list of achievements that, as usual, was headed by a higher tax threshold and the so-called pupil premium. Neither is going turn him into a Beveridge or a Lloyd George. That is not so much because the detail of these policies is awry (although the tax threshold is badly targeted, and the pupil premium is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/04/schooling-more-for-poor\" title=\"\">smaller than the pro-poor funding which Labour introduced</a>). Rather, it is because neither are institutions; they are just financial figures that can and will be undone by inflation once this parliament is out of the way.</p> <p>Governments are remembered for solid things such as the NHS, privatised industries or devolved parliaments. A democratic House of Lords could have ranked on that list, but nothing else the Liberal Democrats have achieved will. Clegg's last gasp is that fixing the economy remains the coalition's reason to be. But even if, as I suspect, Clegg somehow sincerely believes this despite the evidence of the double dip, no one can pretend that the oversight of cuts is a distinctly progressive task. If a Liberal Democrat party that is now <a href=\"http://www7.politicalbetting.com/index.php/archives/2012/08/03/how-long-can-the-liberal-democrats-keep-losing-members/\" title=\"\">haemorrhaging members</a> wants to reclaim the p-word, it needs to consider change at the top. The shattering of Clegg's self-esteem in the looking glass could bring seven years of bad luck.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's Olympic stars are drawn from diverse backgrounds and plenty of Team GB's medal-winners have been inspired by teachers at state schools. But amid the medal haul one private school stands out for its eye-catching contribution \u2013 Millfield in Somerset has taught seven of the competitors and ex-pupils have won two gold medals.</p> <p>Helen Glover, who was at the independent school in Somerset from 2002 to 2004, won Britain's first gold medal in the women's rowing pair. Peter Wilson, who was at Millfield from 2000 to 2005, won gold in the double trap shooting.</p> <p>The school's other competitors include swimmer James Disney-May and fencer Sophie Williams. Three former pupils of the school are competing for Ireland, Germany and South Africa.</p> <p>The school, which charges boarders \u00a310,000 a term, has lavish facilities including an Olympic-sized swimming pool and an equestrian centre. It also has a history of recruiting expert sports coaches including the ex-Olympians Helen Gouldby and Gary Jennings.</p> <p>The school's director of sport, Graham Maw, is a former elite performance director for the Welsh Rugby Union. Before that he had a spell as the British Triathlon Association's performance director.</p> <p>Maw said: \"When the school was established 75 years ago it was established with sport as one of its central tenets. The ethos of the school was about discovering the potential and the spark within each individual pupil. For some that might be mathematics, for many others it's in different avenues of sport.\"</p> <p>Maw acknowledged that Millfield's pupils benefited from \"sensational\" facilities but said this was only part of the story.</p> <p>\"You don't need a first-class county cricket pitch to learn to play cricket. You can still learn and be enthusiastic with modest facilities.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Introduction</h2> <p>Running, jumping, throwing, vaulting, doping, wheezing, stopping. All the stuff the fit kids at school did with ease \u2013 except the last three, which you did. Well, no longer. This is your moment. Find the tightest pair of shorts you can: it's time to hit the track.</p> <h2>The basics</h2> <p>England Athletics describes it as \"the most exciting, diverse and vibrant sport there is\". Which it would, I suppose. Diverse is right, at least: current championship regulations include 32 events, ranging from the 100m to the discus to the decathlon. You'll probably focus on one to begin with \u2013 though not necessarily the one you anticipate. Paula Radcliffe's coach, Alex Stanton, has this to say: \"Try not to set your mind on 'I'm going to be a good runner'. That's OK but it's important to try other things at the same time. Some long-distance runners end up sprinting or throwing, some go the other way round and do the longer distances. It just depends on what you enjoy.\" The best route forward is to find a club. Don't be daunted \u2013 most welcome a wide range of age and ability level.</p> <h2>Health benefits</h2> <p>These vary according to your chosen event. Distance running can lead to weight loss, muscle toning and cardiovascular health, and even help alleviate insomnia. Shot putting builds strength and balance. Throwing the javelin makes you feel like an extra on Game of Thrones. All can have some positive effect on energy levels, mood and general fitness.</p> <h2>Equipment, costs and practicalities</h2> <p>Club memberships vary in price: for example, it's \u00a335 a year for <a href=\"http://www.abergeleharriers.co.uk/ASH.htm\">Abergele Harriers</a> non-track-based running club, \u00a350 for track-based <a href=\"http://www.worcester-ac.co.uk/Membership.htm\">Worcester Athletic Club</a>, and \u00a340 for membership of the track-based <a href=\"http://www.southlondonharriers.org/about-us/why-join-slh.html\">South London Harriers</a>. The fee includes a stipend paid to the relevant national athletics association. A basic pair of track spikes can be had from about \u00a325. After that, it depends how much you want to spend: equipment exists to boost every feasible aspect of performance.</p> <h2>Trendiness rating: 7/10</h2> <p>The running revolution continues apace in the UK (you've seen the body police doing laps of the park). As you move towards the murkier field events, the cool factor begins to decline, but the satisfaction of having found a group of fellow pole-vaulting enthusiasts probably makes up for that.</p> <h2>Inside line</h2> <p><strong>Liz Birchall, UK Athletics:</strong> \"Athletics is a sport that offers opportunities for everyone.

Well, it turns out that the electoral college is fertile ground for this width v depth analogy. A candidate may win a great many states by a tiny margin and thus appear to have won a large victory even though he was actually quite close to being defeated: the mile-wide, inch-deep win.</p> <p>Jack Kennedy's <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1960&amp;off=0&amp;f=1\">1960 win</a> is a perfect example. He won 303 electoral votes or 56.4% of the available 537. That would imply an ample cushion of victory, but JFK would have fallen short of the necessary 50%+1 of electoral votes if the margin in each state had shifted by only 0.52 percentage points more toward Republican Richard Nixon.</p> <p>George W Bush's <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2004&amp;off=0&amp;f=1\">2004 victory</a> is a great example of the opposite scenario. He only won 286 electoral votes, or 53.2% of the available 538; and if Bush had lost Ohio, he would have lost the election. Yet, he won Ohio by the relatively comfortable margin of 2.1 percentage points. Bush's victory was therefore deeper than the raw number of electoral votes he won implied.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/2012_elections_electoral_college_map_no_toss_ups.html\">electoral map</a> this year gives Democrats the jumping-joys and Republicans the willies. Newsweek/Daily Beast columnist Michael Tomasky <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/04/michael-tomasky-on-the-possible-coming-obama-landslide.html\">puts it</a> best, as \"The (Possible) Coming Obama Landslide\". All polling aggregators give President Obama an edge over Mitt Romney in the electoral college. In fact, if the polling average of every state were correct, then as of today, Barack Obama would win 332 electoral votes, or 61.7% of the available 538.</p> <p>The question, though, is just how deep is Obama's lead? To know the answer, we have to have an idea of which states will decide the election.</p> <p>Most analysts would agree that the states with the great chance of being \"Florida 2000\" are Colorado, Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Virginia. All were states won at least once by George W Bush, but were then carried in 2008 by Barack Obama. Obama leads in all of them currently. But how big are those leads?</p> <p>I've taken a median of the polling data for each state for all non-partisan polls since 1 June. I use the median to control for outlier polls and reference back to 1 June because most experts agree the race hasn't changed much since then. If a pollster has taken more than one poll in the state, I use the most recent data available.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394351901\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/8/6/1344272706399/Battlegroundmedians_220.jpg\" alt=\"Battleground state median polling\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Table: Harry Enten/guardiannews.com</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It turns out that Obama's leads are really not that deep. If the margin shifted a point and a half away from Obama in Florida, Iowa, and Virginia, he would be at 284 electoral votes, or 52.8%. Few would call that a \"blowout\".</p> <p>An Obama supporter might reason that it's no big deal if Obama loses a percentage point in Florida, because he'll still hold onto Iowa. Maybe, but states' presidential support tend to move in unison with each other. That's why <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100807112912im_/http://www.stat.columbia.edu/%7Ecook/movabletype/mlm/2000_2004.png\">uniform swings</a> referenced to changes in the national vote do a fine job of predicting changes in states' support. If Romney gains in Florida, he'll probably gain in Iowa and Virginia. Put another way, state-by-state presidential results are <a href=\"http://blogs.middlebury.edu/presidentialpower/2012/08/05/an-electoral-landslide-for-obama/\"><em>not</em> independent of each other</a>.</p> <p>Thus the key state, according to the median poll data, is Ohio. If Obama wins Ohio, he will almost certainly win re-election. If Romney takes it, he is in very good position.</p> <p>Ohio seems, on the one hand, the perfect state for Mitt Romney. Romney's doing very well <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/08/obama-problem-white-working-class-americans\">nationally</a> with white working-class voters. In Ohio, 50% of <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#OHP00p1\">2008 voters</a> were whites who lacked a college education \u2013 well above the <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#USP00p1\">national demographic of 39%</a>.</p> <p>Yet, Romney's fallen back in Ohio. A one-time lead in a number of state polls has become a 3-point deficit in the median. The <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/241755-obama-takes-the-lead-in-critical-ohio\">auto industry</a> is recovering in the state; some <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/105201/ohio-the-place-where-bain-might-be-paying\">might argue</a> that Ohio is a state where the Obama campaign's attacks on Romney's Bain Capital record seemed to be working.</p> <p>I'd point out, instead, that Romney simply hasn't consolidated the Republican base. As <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/105511/obama-ohio-romney-polls\">Nate Cohn notes</a>, there is \"good reason to believe that Romney can make the jump to 46 or 47% without much difficulty, and that would effectively inaugurate a dead heat in the Buckeye State.\"</p> <p>The median poll in Ohio, which was a <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/06/obama-leads-romney-by-3-in-ohio.html#more\">Public Policy Polling survey</a> taken from mid June, illustrates this comeback potential well. Obama captured 83% of Democrats, but Romney only held 79% of Republicans. Merely bumping Romney up to an equal 83% support among Republicans cuts Obama's 3-point lead in the PPP poll in half. </p> <p>Whether Romney will actually do any of this catching-up, and win, is a different matter. It again comes down to a question of depth. Are those voters who are normally reachable for a Republican totally against Romney? Or are they just wary of him? If you can answer that question, you'll know whether Romney stands a chance in November.</p>",
  "<p>China's state-run media has lambasted the United States over its intervention in the South China Sea row, highlighting the alarming escalation of a long-running dispute.</p> <p>Furious commentaries ordered Washington to \"shut up\" and accused it of \"fanning the flames and provoking division\" in the region. The foreign ministry in Beijing called in a senior US diplomat at the weekend over the State Department comments.</p> <p>Analysts fear the South China Sea has become a major potential flashpoint, as tensions have risen sharply between China \u2013 which claims almost all the sea \u2013 and Vietnam and the Philippines. Brunei, Taiwan and Malaysia also lay claim to parts of the sea, which contains valuable energy reserves and fisheries and sees an estimated $5 trillion of cargo \u2013 half the world's shipping tonnage \u2013 pass through its sea lanes annually.</p> <p>\"While the likelihood of major conflict remains low, all of the trends are in the wrong direction, and prospects of resolution are diminishing,\" the <a href=\"http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/asia/north-east-asia/china/229-stirring-up-the-south-china-sea-ii-regional-responses.aspx\" title=\"\">International Crisis Group warned</a> in a recent report on the six-party dispute.</p> <p>Beijing's most recent moves include offering oil and gas exploration blocks for bidding and establishing a new city, Sansha, which boasts at most a few thousand residents and 5 square miles (13 square kilometres) of land spread over several tiny islands \u2013 yet lays claim to 772,000 square miles (2 million square kilometres) of sea and its own military garrison.</p> <p>It prompted the US to publicly reenter the row, with a statement expressing concern at the growing tensions and singling out Beijing's role. The city and garrison \"run counter to collaborative diplomatic efforts to resolve differences and risk further escalating tensions in the region,\" said Patrick Ventrell, acting deputy spokesperson at the State Department.</p> <p>Beijing responded by calling in the US deputy chief of mission and state media ran a spate of hostile pieces. \"We are entirely entitled to shout at the United States, 'Shut up'. How can meddling by other countries be tolerated in matters that are within the scope of Chinese sovereignty?\" asked a commentary in the overseas edition of the People's Daily, the official Communist party newspaper.</p> <p>The domestic version accused Washington of \"fanning the flames and provoking division\" in the region.</p> <p>State media say Beijing's moves are a response to the actions of Manila and Hanoi, such as a new law requiring all foreign ships passing through the disputed waters to notify Vietnamese authorities.</p> <p>In Chinese eyes, it is \u2013 as deputy foreign minister Cui Tiankai recently described it \u2013 a \"victim\", not the instigator.</p> <p>Though its far smaller neighbours bristle at such a description, the new ICG report notes: \"China is not stoking tensions on its own. South East Asian claimants ... are now more forcefully defending their claims \u2013 and enlisting outside allies \u2013 with considerable energy.\"</p> <p>Shading the row is concern about the Obama administration's refocusing of foreign policy in a \"pivot to Asia\". The US says it has no territorial ambitions in the Sea and no position on the competing claims to land features, but has a national interest in freedom of navigation and maintaining peace and stability.</p> <p>But Chinese hawks warn of an attempt to encircle and contain China while others argue that, at a minimum, its rivals are exploiting the US shift.</p> <p>A Xinhua commentary this weekend accused the US of double-dealing and urged Washington to show it was not seeking \"to clip China's wings and shore up the United States' cracking pedestal in the Asia-Pacific\".</p> <p>In a speech quoted by the Global Times, Zhou Fangyin of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences noted: \"Countries with territorial disputes with China believe that the costs and risks of provoking China have largely dropped ... China's rapid rise may also make [them] realize that their chances of reaping and consolidating benefits by encroaching upon Chinese territories would be smaller in the future.\"</p> <p>In any case, argues Rory Medcalf of Australia's Lowy Institute, \"It has become academic to ask who started it ... What we see now is an action-reaction cycle.\"</p> <p>The multitude of Chinese agencies involved has stoked tensions, the ICG has argued, with poor coordination and some actors seeing it as a way to increase their power and budget.</p> <p>Increasing militarisation of the dispute makes it harder to resolve skirmishes, but could also raise the threshold for armed conflict, it noted.</p> <p>\"More immediate conflict risks lie in the growing number of law enforcement and paramilitary vessels playing an increasing role in disputed territories without a clear legal framework\", it added.</p> <p>Domestic nationalism in other claimant countries adds to the difficulties.</p> <p>No one wants military conflict, not only because of the inevitable disruption of trade. The smaller countries would have to take on mighty China, while such a conflict \"would undermine [Beijing's] peaceful rise thesis, cause irreparable damage to its image and foreign policy in Asia and push other countries far closer to the US.</p> <p>Clearly none of that is in China's interests,\" said Ian Storey, of the Institute of South East Asian Studies in Singapore.</p> <p>Yet should it come to an exchange of fire, even the US could feel compelled to become involved \u2013 with great reluctance \u2013 to defend its credibility as an ally not only to the Philippines but countries across Asia, argued Medcalf.</p> <p>Analysts see little hope of resolving the dispute and say the best-case scenario is now the agreement of measures to handle clashes.</p> <p>\"I don't think any of the claimants have any good options. They have all painted themselves into a corner,\" said Storey.</p>",
  "<p>I'm propping myself up against the machine, forcing my eyes to stay open, shifting from foot to foot. Yet another image of a bag slides past on the screen in front of me. I'm in the final minutes of a 13-hour shift as an x-ray screener and I am exhausted. \"Stay awake, stay awake,\" urges one of my fellow workers.</p> <p>Until recently the army has been running most of the entrances to the Olympic Park: operating the x-ray machines and doing bag and body searches on hundreds of thousands of visitors.</p> <p>Now, as more gates are opened with the start of the track and field events, they are beginning to hand over some of those responsibilities. G4S are under pressure to deliver.</p> <p>Security is a heptathlon of sorts \u2013 there are seven disciplines. Two people load bags into trays; another searches bags. There are two body searchers, a team leader \u2013 and me.</p> <p>I am in the hot seat, operating the Rapiscan x-ray machine. It might not sound very taxing compared to the herculean efforts going on all around us, but all of these jobs are exhausting.</p> <p>We're on our feet for 12 hours, trying to present a friendly face to visitors to the Olympics. As a \"screener\" I have to look at an x-ray image of every bag that goes through our lane, checking carefully for liquids, sharps, aerosols, anything that might be a threat.</p> <p>In my training I was told how it was important to swap with another screener every 20 minutes, otherwise you begin to miss things. But that's not happening. It's pretty clear there are not enough of us for handovers like that.</p> <p>I've had specific training and had to pass some exams to get this role. So I was a bit taken aback when I was asked to train someone else who didn't have any of the right qualifications.</p> <p>He had been working as a guard until now, but our team leader thought he might like to have a go on the Rapiscan.</p> <p>Over the last few days I've seen lots of people without x-ray training operating the machines. It's a way of giving the screeners a break.</p> <p>Some of the team leaders are stricter, and won't allow this to happen.</p> <p>But that means some screeners, including me, can spend most of the day in front of the screen \u2013 and you definitely start to miss things.</p> <p>Even the screeners who have been trained aren't always that good. I saw a row break out over a knife being missed. Luckily the bag searcher went running after the visitor as he headed towards the park.</p> <p>G4S are clearly paranoid about being seen to do a good job. Every day we are visited by teams from Locog or the military who stand around with clipboards. The machines test us too, throwing out Threat Image Projections (TIPs). It makes running the Rapiscans like playing a computer game. I feel a real sense of achievement when I spot a TIP showing a gun or a packet of Semtex \u2013 although I notice a drop in success whenever I haven't had a proper break.</p> <p>We have a steady stream of visitors pouring through our gates into the park.</p> <p>Most people are in a great mood and quite a few congratulate us on the efficiency of the gates, pleasantly surprised that the queues are not too long. Someone even says: \"You should run the airports.\" I think we're certainly doing a good job of being welcoming and efficient in getting visitors through the gates.</p> <p>But sometimes I feel like we're just here for show. The presence of security guards, x-ray machines and metal detectors, dissuading any potential trouble-makers. I do have concerns about the safety of the bag screening process. At busy times we're getting around 400 bags and clothes going through an hour. It's quite a task for a team of sometimes exhausted workers with little experience and sometimes little training.</p> <p><em>\u2022 G4S has denied it does not have enough trained screeners to work the x-ray machines at the Olympic Park. A spokesman told the Guardian the company now had more than it needed at the venues. </em></p>",
  "<p>The cross-border <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/05/attack-across-egypt-israel-border?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">attack on Israel by militants</a> in the Egyptian Sinai was a highly ambitious and well-planned assault that has left Israeli authorities more certain than ever that the area is out of control \u2013 but also with a major dilemma over how to respond.</p> <p>A serious attack, potentially resulting in the deaths of many Israelis living in small communities near the border, was narrowly averted, according to senior officials.</p> <p>After killing about 15 Egyptian security personnel at a base in the border town of Rafah, the militants used a pickup truck filled with explosives to breach the Egypt-Israel border, then drove an armoured vehicle more than a mile into Israel before being struck by a missile fired from an Israeli military plane. Up to eight militants were killed.</p> <p>They were heavily armed and, significantly, were wearing suicide belts, thought to indicate a strong ideological motivation for the attack. A statement from the Egyptian military said 35 militants were involved and \"elements from the Gaza Strip\" aided the attack by firing rockets, suggesting co-ordination between Palestinian and Sinai militants.</p> <p>Israel's alarm at the mounting chaos and violence in Sinai has been growing steadily since their ally, the former president Hosni Mubarak, was ousted in the Egyptian revolution 18 months ago. As well as three serious cross-border attacks \u2013 one last August in which eight Israelis were killed, one in June in which an Israeli construction worker died and the one on Sunday evening \u2013 a pipeline supplying gas to Israel has been blown up more than a dozen times.</p> <p>The impoverished and neglected Sinai region has been a breeding ground for resentment and radicalism among its largely Bedouin inhabitants for years. But Israel says it now detects the presence of \"global jihad\" militants and groups, some loosely connected to al-Qaida.</p> <p>\"There is a problem with Bedouin tribes drifting towards a fundamentalist Islamic ideology, making themselves part of the Islamic jihad movement, by which I mean a loose network of small terror organisations trying to fight the current order,\" said Major General Dan Harel, former deputy chief of staff for the Israel Defence Forces.</p> <p>One of the difficulties Israel faces is intelligence-gathering across the border.</p> <p>\"Israel has a good hold on what's happening in Gaza\" as a result of close monitoring via aerial drones and human intelligence, said Yaakov Katz, a journalist specialising in defence and military affairs. \"Sinai is much more difficult.\"</p> <p>Even so, Israeli military intelligence had advance indication that an attack was imminent and responded swiftly when it was launched, thwarting an extremely serious incident, according to the defence minister, Ehud Barak. In Gaza, such intelligence would have resulted in a pre-emptive strike on a militant cell planning an attack \u2013 an option simply not available across the Egyptian border.</p> <p>Assuming that Israel shared its intelligence with its Egyptian counterparts, the Israeli military distrusts its neighbour's willingness to take effective action to rein in militants in Sinai and exert a grip on the area. That may now change.</p> <p>\"I hope this will be a wake-up call for Egypt regarding the necessity to be sharp and efficient on their side,\" said Barak while touring the site of the attack on Monday morning.</p> <p>Cairo cannot afford to ignore the loss of more than a dozen Egyptian soldiers. According to Katz, Mohammed Morsi, the new Muslim Brotherhood president of Egypt, \"is going to have to deal with this. Up until now he could pretend this wasn't a big problem. But this could be a turning point. Is [the government] going to take control or allow [the region] to remain a safe haven for al-Qaida and global jihad types?\"</p> <p>And, indeed, within hours of the attack, Morsi was pledging to \"impose full control\" on Sinai, later sending helicopter gunships to join a security sweep of the area.</p> <p>Israel, however, does not like to outsource its security \u2013 and does not usually shy away from taking action on foreign territory to protect its citizens and interests.</p> <p>But this is a delicate situation. Since Israel and Egypt signed a peace treaty in 1979, Sinai has been a demilitarised zone, with tight restrictions on troops on the ground. Israel is unlikely to take steps which could threaten the treaty's durability, especially in the context of its concerns over the post-revolution government's commitment to the accord.</p> <p>\"Israel has strategic interests in keeping the peace treaty. This is why we're not attacking on Egyptian soil and instead conveying alerts we have to the Egyptian authorities in the hope they will deal with it,\" Harel said.</p> <p>The repercussions of Israeli action across the border would be significant, Katz said.</p> <p>\"The end of the peace treaty, demonstrations throughout Egypt, our ambassador being kicked out of Cairo? Israel's ability to respond is very limited.\"</p> <p>After Israeli forces shot dead five Egyptian security personnel on Egyptian soil after last August's cross-border attack, anti-Israel sentiment rose markedly and the Israeli embassy in Cairo came under violent attack.</p> <p>But some are urging a robust response. According to Alex Fishman, the defence analyst for Israel's biggest-selling newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, the time for direct action is drawing closer.</p> <p>\"The political leadership in Israel&#xa0;\u2026 is being respectful of Egyptian honour, afraid to sneeze next to them or demand, heaven forbid, that they do anything,\" he wrote. \"There will be no choice: Israel is approaching the point at which it will have to deal with Sinai on its own, with everything this entails, including how it will affect the relationship with Egypt. Otherwise there will be a bloodbath here in a style we have not seen before.\"</p>",

For bonus smug points, can you also identify the bird in the background? </p> <p><strong>Response:</strong> The identity of this particular bird has been the source of many long and detailed conversations over a period of many months. The likely possibilities are nicely outlined here by one of our regular mystery bird commenters, icancho:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>By its general 'jizz', shape and legs (and assuming this is NOT one of your not-really-English-birds-that-just-happens-to-be-living-in-UK-right-now) this would seem to be either: 1. an odd leucistic plumage 'sport' of the 'short-billed' fowl that breeds in Greenland, Iceland &amp; Svalbard, but winters in Britain and the margins of the n.w. European mainland; OR, 2. a hybrid of 1. and one of its 'way-North' American cousins (the bill colour and the bill- and head-shape suggests one of the rarer ones, perhaps). The overall appearance of the head and the pattern &amp; colour of the secondaries and tertials makes me favour option 2. over 1. [<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17453218\">link</a>] </p> </blockquote> <p>icancho goes on to further speculate: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>where is this miscegenation supposed to have taken place? where would the parents have lived? Bernard's goose's natural range is VERY far removed from Lincolnshire. OK there's loads of exotics kicking about the UK, but that goose still has to be pretty infrequent, no? Given that large patches of white can show up in many hybrids, regardless of either parent showing such, could this not perhaps have been produced by native birds?\u2014 perhaps a 'burnt crustacean' (giving the bill- and head-shape) and a 'short-bill' (matches the back &amp; wings quite well). Their natural breeding ranges are very similar (excepting Iceland). [<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17494332\">link</a>] </p> </blockquote> <p>Despite icancho's doubts, the prevailing opinion proposes this bird is a hybrid barnacle goose, <em>Branta leucopsis</em>, X Ross's goose, <em>Chen rossii</em>, making this bird a very unusual intergeneric hybrid. </p> <p>The photographer, Adrian White, writes: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Birdforums had a long discussion on [this bird's] parentage and origins. The consensus was that it was a hybrid as there should be some brownish feathering on the back (and not just black) as would be expected if it was leucistic. The bird was first found in the Northeast in Northumberland and was tracked down the East coast to Norfolk/Suffolk before we found it with a suspected feral flock of Barnacle [geese] at Cleethorpes. There is a free-flying flock of Barnacles whose origin is believed to be Flamingoland Zoo and Themepark. </p> </blockquote> <p>Individual birds such as our mystery bird are a welcome test for one's observational and ID skills whilst also serving to deepen one's knowledge of the local avifauna. </p> <p>The bird that is partially pictured in the background is an adult barnacle goose, providing a nice contrast for both colouring and colour pattern on the body parts that are visible. </p> <h2>The Mystery Birds reference library:</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/grrlscientist/2012/may/12/2\">Africa</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/grrlscientist/2012/may/05/6\">South and Central America</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/grrlscientist/2012/apr/28/6\">Oceania and the South Pacific Ocean</a></p> <p>.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. </p> <p>You are invited to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/punctuated-equilibrium/mystery-bird\">review all of the daily mystery birds</a> by going to their dedicated graphic index page. </p> <p>If you have bird images, video or audio files that you'd like to share with a large and (mostly) appreciative international audience here at <em>the Guardian</em>, feel free to contact me to learn more. </p> <p>.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. </p> <p>twitter: @<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/GrrlScientist\">GrrlScientist</a> <br>facebook: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/grrlscientist\">grrlscientist</a> <br>evil google+: <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/111331532997434679580/posts\">grrlscientist</a><br>email: grrlscientist@gmail.com</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 Many people may have doubted Usain Bolt, but the Americans never did. While 2bn people around the world watched the event live on TV, the US broadcaster NBC chose to show it later. Presumably to give Tyson Gay and Justin Gatlin enough time for a head start.</p> <p>\u2022 He's the face of the Olympics. No, it's not Bradley Wiggins or Mo Farah, it's Boris Johnson, the man who has managed to get more screen time than any athlete over the past 10 days. On Monday morning he turned up on Radio 4 to lecture the nation on how the Olympics are restoring a sense of morality to the nation. \"There was a culture of easy gratification and entitlement and all the rest of it,\" he told the Today programme, while talking about last year's riots. If anyone knows about easy gratification and entitlement, it's our Bozza.</p> <p>\u2022 If you were in any doubt that there is a pecking order of events within the Olympics, just check out the whereabouts of John Inverdale. Having anchored the outside broadcasts of the rowing last week, Inverdale has skipped off to the Olympic Stadium, leaving Rishi Persad (who?) to replace him at Eton Dorney for the canoeing events in which no one in Britain is that interested. Unless we look like winning a medal. Meanwhile, on Sunday night Inverdale and Colin Jackson went head to head at the 100m final, to see who could wear the jacket with the most hideous piping. Presumably after having gone clothes shopping with Ian Thorpe.</p> <p>\u2022 Security has noticeably slackened off at Weymouth. On Sunday at the sailing, everyone caught trying to enter the Nothe spectator area with an umbrella larger than 30cm was treated like a potential terrorist with an offensive weapon. After many complaints, the regulations have now been relaxed so that spectators can bring in any sized brolly as long it fits inside their bags. No mentions of just how large a bag you are allowed, though.</p> <p>\u2022 All pretence at impartiality is now officially over. When the Belarus athlete Ekaterina Poplavskaya crashed out of her first heat in the 100m hurdles after 40m, you could almost hear the indifference as Colin Jackson said: \"Four years of hard work, bless her.\" When the Jamaican hurdler Brigitte Foster-Hylton came to grief in her heat a few minutes later, Jackson and Denise Lewis reacted as if there had been a death in the family.</p> <p>\u2022 The Aussie-baiting continues. Having concluded it was probably a bit de trop to mention yet again how many medals we have got compared to the pitiful Aussie haul, Hazel Irvine adopted the even more patronising approach of comparing the Aussies to the Kiwis. \"Just look,\" she said. \"The New Zealanders are in 14th place with three golds while Australia are 10 places lower with just one gold.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Very little at the Olympic Games goes unsold. Long gone are the unmarked buggies to go and collect the javelins from the centre of the stadium, and in comes a fleet of mini Mini Coopers thanks to the sponsorship of BMW. It makes you think of the commercial opportunities that have been missed. Watching the women's marathon on Sunday, I was surprised to discover the route did not include several run-through McDonald's, rather than a few trestle tables masquerading as the athletes' feeding station. Still, there's plenty of time to sort this out before the men's marathon on Sunday.</p> <p>********</p> <p>\u2022 The whole world wanted to chat to Usain Bolt on Sunday night after the 100m. But the only person Bolt wanted to speak to was Mel C of the Spice Girls, whom he asked to pose for a picture with him later that evening. Just think: not only the world's fastest man but the world's only man who can instantly recognise Sporty Spice.</p> <p>\u2022<strong> Excuse of the day:</strong> after being expelled from the Olympic Games for testing positive for marijuana, the US judoka Nicholas Delpopolo said he had inadvertently eaten food that he did not realise had been baked with the recreational drug.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Lingowatch: Tkatchev</strong> \u2013 a move named after the Soviet gymnast Alexander Tkatchev in which the athlete releases him/herself from the high bar and flies back over it backwards. Otherwise known as the reverse hecht. Please do try this at home.</p>",
  "<p>I've been a keen cyclist and have done a lot of marathons so I was eager to see how the cycling would go. Cycling has to be one of the hardest sports on the planet. I've done some long trips myself during one day but I will never understand how the professionals do it from one day to the next. I have the utmost respect for them. I'm not afraid to admit that I was crying at the end of Bradley Wiggins's gold medal win.</p> <p>I've caught most of the Olympics and seen all sorts of sports. I've watched a lot of the judo, I did it myself many moons ago. It's been brilliant. I love to see true passion coming through. I wasn't expecting to like the clay pigeon shooting but I got hooked straight away.</p> <p>We're lucky at the centre because we've been allowed to put the iPlayer on if there's anything in particular we want to catch, what with the London Olympics being a one-off.</p> <p>The coverage of the Games has been great. You can see everything. But I haven't liked the press using words like \"failure\". For instance, cycling is a really tactical sport so saying Mark Cavendish \"limped over the line\" when he did nothing of the sort, that got to me. And saying Tom Daley failed isn't right, everyone can make a mistake. I was worried that the Great British pastime of knocking people down would start but, since the medals have been coming in, that seems to have eased up a bit.</p> <p>I loved the opening ceremony. The fact they played a bit of Sex Pistols and Pink Floyd was great. And when Great Britain came out to David Bowie's Heroes, that choked me up.</p>",
  "<p>A little-known fact: the first victim of retaliatory violence following the 9/11 attacks was a Sikh man. On 15 September 2001, 52-year-old Balbir Singh Sodhi, a gas-station owner in Arizona, was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/sep/17/september11.usa22\" title=\"\">shot five times by Frank Roque</a>. While Sodhi died instantly, Roque went on to shoot at other ethnic minorities before going to a local bar and boasting: \"They're investigating the murder of a turban-head down the street.\"</p> <p>Yesterday, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/05/wisconsin-sikh-temple-domestic-terrorism\" title=\"\">a gunman opened fire on a Sikh congregation in Wisconsin</a>, killing six people in what is now being treated as an act of \"domestic terrorism\". Some witnesses say the shooter had a tattoo marking the September 11 attacks, though this is not confirmed by the authorities.</p> <p>While the \"war on terror\" that followed September 2001 badly affected Muslim families in the west, it is sadly less well-known that Sikhs have also faced significant harassment as a consequence. The Sikh Coalition of Washington <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/nation/article/Sikhs-report-rise-in-attacks-after-9-11-3764832.php\" title=\"\">said yesterday</a> that Sikhs in the US have faced more than 700 such incidents since 9/11; authorities still do not officially collect data on religious hate crimes against them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bhalomanush/status/232286686510469121\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Don Lemmon asks on CNN, \"Do Sikhs have any traditional enemies?\"...

When a group of Sikhs from around the UK organised a vigil outside the US embassy in London to reiterate that \"Sikhs were not Muslims\", many distanced themselves from the implication that hate crimes against Muslims were OK.</p> <p>In many cases, faith groups did spring up (among Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims) to assert a more distinct religious identity and distance themselves from the \"Asian\" umbrella. But that also put them at odds with older anti-racism groups that were based around a more inclusive, secular identity.</p> <p>The media ignorance of Sikh issues and the religion itself hasn't helped either. Yesterday, US cable television itself displayed some <a href=\"http://liberalconspiracy.org/2012/08/06/the-awful-us-media-coverage-of-sikh-temple-shootings/\" title=\"\">staggering examples of ignorance</a>.</p> <p>In Britain, too, there is anger online that the media has largely airbrushed away the bigotry and violence Sikhs have suffered since 9/11 and 7/7. Discussions on the BBC Asian Network radio station today expressed similar sentiments. But by and large, Sikhs have quietly soldiered on in the hope that the harassment would eventually go away.</p> <p>The religion was officially founded by Guru Nanak Dev Ji in Punjab, India, around the late 1400s. He was the first of 10 living Gurus (teachers) who would build, rally and form a Sikh community that now numbers approximately 30 million across the world. The tenth Guru \u2013 Gobind Singh \u2013 commanded Sikhs to carry a more distinctive identity in the form of five Ks (translated to: a steel bangle, keeping long hair, a comb, cotton underwear and a sword); each of the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/customs/fiveks.shtml\" title=\"\">five Ks is symbolic</a>.</p> <p>It's even more difficult to summarise the religious philosophy, though it is a misconception that Sikhism is very similar to Hinduism: the former officially rejects the caste system, praying to idols and is very much monotheistic. Sikhs regard the scriptures \u2013 called the <a href=\"http://www.sikhs.org/granth.htm\" title=\"\">Sri Guru Granth Sahib (SGGS)</a> \u2013 as the 11th and eternal teacher for the Sikhs. It is also a more inclusive and less ritualistic religion \u2013 the Gurus invited Hindu and Muslim preachers to contribute to the SGGS with the view that knowledge and understanding is universal and not dependent on one path of life.</p> <p>While the background details of the domestic terrorist have not yet been released, I hope the incident will at least shine greater light on how such awful bigotry and ignorance continues to affect so many people.</p>",

  "<p>\"People like you \u2026 \" These three words, as innocent as they might sound, should be the epitaph for last August's riots.</p> <p>It was 3am when the police barged into my house to search for stolen goods. \"We've seen hundreds of people like you before, just tell us where the stuff is and don't waste our time,\" they said. I had nothing to hide. I stood by and watched them hunt for something that wasn't there.</p> <p>They arrested me on suspicion of theft and they took me to the station. \"I get people like you coming here every day,\" I remember the custody sergeant telling me, \"so don't think you're special.\" I definitely didn't feel special then and once I was refused bail there was nothing special about spending a month in Feltham young offender institution. There was meant to be hundreds of other \"people like me\" in jail but, aside from everyone else being young and often black, I felt very alone.</p> <p>They charged me with two offences \u2013 dwelling with intent to commit theft and joint enterprise \u2013 and they said I was looking at five years in jail. I gave my side of the story in court and explained that I'd left my house to see all the madness on TV in real life \u2013 it looked like history in the making and I didn't want to miss out. I'd followed others into a shop for five minutes and had no intention of stealing anything. I left of my own accord. Emptyhanded. \"That's what people like you always say,\" the prosecution said. The judge told me he didn't believe me. My heart sank. As far as I could tell, for people like me, fate was already decided.</p> <p>Every black kid is told the same thing: \"You have to try harder in life because you're black.\" My mum was the first one to tell me this, and then a white teacher gave her version of it at school: \"You're smart, but there are two routes for you: crime or a career. And as a black boy you should try to be different,\" she said.</p> <p>As a teenager this was tough to understand. First, you're insecure and just want to be like everyone else, wear the same clothes \u2013 for me and my friends it was mainly cheap tracksuits \u2013 and listen to the same music. Second, why the hell do I have to try harder just because I'm black?</p> <p>As I got older the answer became clearer. With that cheap tracksuit, trainers and hoodie came routine stop and searches. Weekly, sometimes daily, if I walked with my black friends. But with that came a weird sense of pride. I thought that if the tracksuit pissed the police off I'd keep wearing it and it seemed that being black to them was like showing red to a bull. But one month in prison, eight weeks on an electronic tag and the possibility of spending five years in a jail quickly turned any sense of pride into fear.</p> <p>I was released in the end after being found not guilty on all charges. That was 10 months ago and my life hasn't returned to normal. The tracksuit's gone and I always wear jeans and a shirt now and never walk down side roads through fear of being stopped again. In many ways I still feel like I'm tagged.</p> <p>Like many of my friends, I still feel the police represent a community that doesn't include me. No one could understand why rioters targeted their local areas, but on that night the shops were owned by the police who had forever targeted us with stop and searches. On that night, the shop I went into wasn't the shop I know well where I regularly speak to the owner.</p> <p>There's rarely a day goes by when the thought of being sent back to the place where they kept me doesn't go through my mind. I live an honest life and have a job. I live by the law. But I know that sometimes isn't enough for people like me.</p>",
  "<h2>Those who dare don't always win<br></h2> <p>So we're out of the starting blocks. I've been busy all weekend, mostly at the Traverse (where you shouldn't miss Simon Stephens's Morning (reviewed in the paper tomorrow) and couldn't fail to enjoy Phil Porter's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/05/blink-edinburgh-festival-review?newsfeed=true\">Blink</a>) but also out and about elsewhere. Already I've missed a couple of shows that I'm aching to see \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.assemblyfestival.com/event.php?id=215\">Mies Julie</a> at Assembly Mound and Rubies in the Attic at Assembly Roxy, both of which I've heard good things about \u2013 due to the inevitable over-runs that happen in the first few days. </p> <p>During the early days of the fringe, as I dash all over the city, I often feel as if I'm in training for an Olympic event \u2013 ironic, given that I've scarcely had a glimpse of London 2012 over the weekend. But I did catch up with <a href=\"https://www.underbelly.co.uk/node/797248\">The Prize</a> at Underbelly, which for those of you who feel you are missing out on the Olympic action is a verbatim play based on interviews with former Olympians and Olympic hopefuls in training for this year's games. It's a bronze- rather than a gold-medal-winning show, but it has some electrifying moments (a former fencer talking about pushy parents) and offers plenty of insights into the passions and also the cruelties of sport (\"you are only ever a hamstring injury away from oblivion\"). Rather cleverly, it lets you get to know the athletes and only reveals towards the end who has \u2013 and who hasn't \u2013 qualified. If you're not in Edinburgh, it heads to Live in Newcastle straight after the fest.</p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>At Rob Drummond's wonderful <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/05/bullet-catch-edinburgh-festival-review\">Bullet Catch</a> on Friday, the young woman invited up on stage to point a gun at him and pull the trigger turned out to be a stage manager. When told what she would be asked to do, she remarked: \"This goes against all my training: you're not supposed to shoot the actor.\"</p> <h2>Outdoors, but not out of sight</h2> <p>It's good to see the Old College Quad back with a full programme of outdoor theatre this year. There have been some remarkable performances here over the years, the most astonishing undoubtedly Ninagawa's Medea, one of those once-seen, never-forgotten theatre experiences. </p> <p>But there have been other memorable performances here, too, including Teatr Biuro Podrozy's stilt-and-fire Carmen Funebre, which in 1995 brought a touch of the Bosnian war to the 1995 Edinburgh fringe; the production returns for one night only on 14 August. Meanwhile the company reprise their visceral take on Macbeth, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2007/aug/07/edinburghfestival2007.edinburghfestival5\">Who is That Bloodied Man?</a> every night until 13 August at 10.30pm. As I said at when it was first here, it's thoughtful as well as an eyeful. </p> <p>That balance isn't quite achieved in <a href=\"http://www.edfringe.com/whats-on/theatre/blind \">The Blind</a>, the new show in the Quad this year, created another young Polish company, the KTO Theatre. Inspired by the novel Blindness by the Portuguese writer Jos\u00e9 Saramago, it tells the story of a world struck blind. Whirling dancers are suddenly rendered helpless and are transformed into a conga line of catastrophe before being isolated by the authorities in a hospital where they create their own rules. It's like Lord of the Flies with added hospital beds, which the cast use like rusty dodgems. You probably need to have some grip on the narrative before you go and the choreography is never as sharp as it could and should be to give this the punch it needs. But the final 25 minutes deliver an eye-watering experience which is as visually stunning as anything you'll ever see: the sky appears to bleed red, glittering rain. As the smoke cleared, I was just delighted that I wasn't the person who was going to have to sweep it all up afterwards.</p> <h2>Word of mouth: rumours and tips</h2> <p>I haven't seen these shows yet, but I am hearing very good things about Bitch Boxer at Underbelly, Rash Dash's Ugly Sisters at <a href=\"http://www.northernstage.co.uk/st-stephens/\">Northern Stage at St Stephen's</a>, and Curious Directive's After the Rainfall at the <a href=\"http://www.pleasance.co.uk/edinburgh/\">Pleasance </a>. Do tell us about the shows you've seen and that you think we should all see. I'll try to follow up any of your suggestions below or you can tweet me <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lyngardner\">@lyngardner</a> \u2013 or stop me in the street if you see me.</p> <h2>One to avoid (sad, but sometimes necessary)</h2> <p>The Intervention @ AR Assembly. \"It's cruel and it's pointless and it's nothing like it says it's going to be in the brochure,\" cries Cassie, one of the characters in this inept family drama presented by the Comedians Theatre Company. You could say much the same about Dave Florez's play, which brings together the family and friends of 38-year-old Zac (Phil Nichol) who is drinking himself into an early grave. A flimsy set, cliched writing and a cast who \u2013 with the exception of Nichol \u2013 barely seem to have bothered to turn up mean that even the skeletons that tumble out of the cupboard should be begging to be let back in.</p>",
  "<p>In the contentious debate over drone warfare, it is necessary to separate US government policy from the broader moral question of killing by aerial robots. The policy question deserves vigorous debate by legal scholars, policy experts, and diplomats. The moral question posed by this new form of remote warfare is more abstract and has only recently begun to receive critical examination by philosophers and ethicists.</p> <p>The Guardian has attempted to feature the distinct moral and philosophical side of this issue, and a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/02/philosopher-moral-case-drones\">recent story profiled my own views on the topic</a>. Unfortunately \u2013 if understandably, given the complexities of the matter \u2013 I consider some of my views were misrepresented. Most disturbingly, I was reported to claim that \"there's no downside\" to killing by drones. In fact, the majority of my work on drones is dedicated to elucidating and analyzing the serious moral downsides that killing by remote control can pose. The Guardian has graciously offered me this space to set the record straight.</p> <p>My view is this: drones can be a morally preferable weapon of war if they are capable of being more discriminate than other weapons that are less precise and expose their operators to greater risk. Of course, killing is lamentable at any time or place, be it in war or any context. But if a military action is morally justified, we are also morally bound to ensure that it is carried out with as little harm to innocent people as possible. </p> <p>The best empirical evidence suggests that drones are more precise, result in fewer unintended deaths of civilian bystanders, and better protect their operators from risk than other weapons, such as manned aircraft, carrying out similar missions. Other things being equal, then, drones should be used in place of other less accurate and riskier weapons. But they should be used only for morally justified missions, in pursuit of a just cause.</p> <p>Thus, my claim about drones is entirely conditional: they should be used only if the mission is just. As with all conditional claims, if the antecedent is false, then the entire claim is invalidated. In this case, if the current US policy being carried out by drones is unjust and wrong, then, of course, such drone use is morally wrong, even if it causes less harm than the use of some other weapon would. </p> <p>Nothing I've said, therefore, endorses or supports the US policy of targeted killing. But saying there are significant potential upsides to a weapon <em>when used justly</em> is a far cry from saying there are \"no downsides\".</p> <p>I do not claim that \"the ends justify the means\", or, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/02/philosopher-moral-case-drones#start-of-comments\">as some of my critics have suggested</a>, that the means justify the end. In this case, the means has significant moral advantages over some alternative means. And if the end is just, then all countries have an obligation to use the means that causes the least unintended harm. Note that my view here is not about any particular country or present policy, but applies to any country fighting in a just cause with the aim of being as discriminate as possible in war.</p> <p>Some argue that drones face \"in principle\" moral problems regardless of the justice of the cause for which they are used. I respect and share many of these moral concerns over the unique problems that arise in killing by remote control, even for a putatively just cause. Yet I conclude that these serious concerns do not override the moral demand to be as discriminate as possible in carrying out an otherwise justified killing. And, moreover, if the mission is just, it is better if those carrying it out do not have to be killed in accomplishing it.</p> <p>I do acknowledge that some means are wrong in principle, regardless of the ends sought. I hold this position on torture, for example. And, indeed, there are many weapons of war that should be ruled out as morally unacceptable in principle, regardless of whether they are put to use for a just cause. Landmines, with their inability to distinguish between an enemy soldier and an innocent child, fall into this category. I also think that autonomous drones \u2013 weapons with an artificial intelligence, which could make lethal decisions on their own \u2013 are morally wrong in principle.</p> <p>Augustine is credited with writing that in war one ought to \"let necessity, therefore, and not your will, slay the enemy who fights against you.\" The idea is that the intentional taking of a human life, even when justified, is always a regrettable, sombre and grave activity only to be undertaken because of moral necessity. But such necessity can arise in modern warfare, particularly in a just cause against those who actively seek to kill innocents.</p> <p>I am not thereby defending current US drone policy. Rather, whether these killings should be carried out in the first place is the pressing question. If one believes that the current US policy of targeted killings is morally objectionable, then it is the policy that should be objected to, not this particular way of implementing it. The conflation of these two issues detracts from the debates on each.</p> <p>Some think war is never justified under any circumstances. If one holds that view, the question of whether drones are a morally permissible weapon is a moot point: on this view, no weapon should ever be used to kill another human being. Given the history of warfare and its concomitant atrocities, this is not an implausible view. But I believe that war can, in some cases and under certain conditions, be justified. If the conditions of just war exist, it's worth exploring whether certain weapons pose special moral problems, or have potential moral advantages, over alternative weapons.</p> <p>Drones, for all their current and potential misuse, have the potential for tremendous moral improvement over the aerial bombardments of earlier eras.</p>",
  "<p>The device keeping disaster away from Glenn Cox's farm in this summer's devastating drought could well be the laptop on his kitchen counter.</p> <p>A few keystrokes and eventually his painfully slow dial-up connection pulls up graphs tracking temperature and moisture levels from his corn and peanut fields.</p> <p>The real-time feed gives Cox an advantage over farmers across a vast swathe of the mid-west who are preparing to give up on their crops.</p> <p>It's taken away the guess work. He knows where to water, and where not to water \u2013 giving Cox a critical advantage in a year when rain is elusive and groundwater is in short supply.</p> <p>This stretch of Georgia is in its second year of drought \u2013 the worst since the 1950s, Cox said. \"If we had not had irrigation we would be filing insurance right now,\" he said. \"That's plain. I could plant it, and without irrigation we would be broke.\"</p> <p>Cox's edge comes through technology developed over the last decade by the University of Georgia. The innovations are seen as the biggest advance on irrigation systems in decades.</p> <p>The lower Flint River basin, where Cox farms, is one of the top agricultural areas in the south-east, producing the country's biggest pecan, peanut and cotton crops. But its weather is increasingly unpredictable, careening between flood and drought. Scientists see the extreme variability of the last 15 years as evidence of climate change and expect it to get worse over the coming decades.</p> <p>Farmers are going to have to make smarter use of water to remain viable. </p> <p>The technology developed at the University of Georgia, and rolled out in partnership with the Nature Conservancy and the Flint River Conservation Project, relies on GPS technology and low-cost sensors.</p> <p>The sensors, encased in PVC pipes, gather temperature and moisture data from different soil depths and at multiple locations. Antennae fitted to the pipe then relay the soil conditions to a computer, where the data is reviewed and analysed by crop consultants. </p> <p>Cox sees himself as a cautious man. His family has been farming in south-western Georgia for five generations, on lands that back up into the cypress, sycamore, and live oaks that line the Flint River. Cox is pushing, not very subtly, to make it a sixth when his daughter Casey finishes college.</p> <p>For years now he has been planting virtually the same mix of peanuts and corn on his 850 acres, but conditions for farmers in Georgia are changing.</p> <p>The last two years have brought drought so severe it killed mature trees. Five years ago, a flood left 4ft of water in his bedroom, along with a dead armadillo, and a live rattlesnake on the porch.</p> <p>The technology promises a degree of certainty. He is not wasting electricity when there is no need to pump water onto his fields. He is not wasting water on the low-lying areas that soak up moisture or the wasteland that hugs the road.</p> <p>\"It's absolutely critical. Water costs money. Electricity costs money. Gas costs money,\" he said. \"It costs a lost of money to bring this crop out of the ground.\"</p> <p>Cox is also spared from driving miles each day checking conditions on his fields. It's all there in a few clicks, even on the sluggish internet connection of rural Georgia. </p> <p>The University of Georgia scientists and the Flint River Project started working with farmers more than a decade ago to try to find ways to save water without sacrificing their crops.</p> <p>They started by testing a low-pressure system for the giant centre pivot irrigation systems that circle the fields, spraying water from scores, sometimes hundreds, of spouts. Water at high pressure can be lost to wind or evaporation. That one change alone probably reduced water use by 20%, said David Reckford, who heads the project for the Nature Conservancy.</p> <p>Next they introduced technology to control individual spouts, which saved farmers from spraying water on the road or nearby wasteland.</p> <p>Then they moved into the world of sensors and data management. Some estimates suggest the technology could help farmers reduce water use by up to 30%.</p> <p>Earlier versions of the variable irrigation systems developed at the University of Georgia are in demand in Kansas and Nebraska, both deep within the drought zone.</p> <p>The systems typically save 1,000 gallons of water per minute, said Rick Heard, a consultant with the Australian firm Farmscan, which is marketing the systems. \"On a really large system you may end up turning off three-quarters of the spigots,\" he said.</p> <p>The next stage promises to be even bigger, said George Vellidis, the agricultural engineer who helped develop the systems. </p> <p>\"I think it's going to be huge,\" he said. \"This is still a little premature but five years from now it's going to be ready for prime time.\"</p> <p>Drought years impose a huge cost even on those farmers who have irrigation systems. They pay more for electricity, their equipment breaks down from overuse during dry spells. And then there is the realisation that the water will not last forever.</p> <p>Vellidis went on: \"Let's say you have limited water supply because you are in extreme drought. Now you have a very smart way to make a decision about how to apply water. You know which field is suffering so you can decide which fields to apply water on.\"</p> <p>The technology could help defuse what are now politically loaded decisions in Georgia because of increasing competition for water from cities, industry, and power stations, in addition to farmers, and because of the implications of climate change.</p> <p>The Republican governor, Nathan Deal, rejects the science of climate change. Late last year, he removed the state climatologist, David Stooksbury, reportedly for upholding established climate science.</p> <p>\"Most elected officials are in denial. They don't believe it's real,\" said Woody Hicks, a hydrologist advising the Flint River project.</p> <p>But he said climate change would exert even greater pressure on water supply and use over the coming decades.</p> <p>The groundwater Cox and other farmers pull up to water their fields is already on borrowed time, with scientists finding a direct connection between withdrawals from underground aquifers and levels in the Flint River.</p> <p>Too much pumping of the underground aquifer sucks the water out of the Flint. It also threatens supplies to the aquifer that waters Florida, Mississippi, and Alabama.</p> <p>As farmers are now discovering, they are going to have learn to get by with less. Now, however, they may be within reach of the technology to do so. </p> <p>\"The farming community now realises we are dealing with a finite resource,\" said Hicks. \"The more straws that go into the can the less water for everyone.\"</p>",
  "<p>In an episode of The Simpsons, the juvenile delinquent Jimbo Jones helps a group which is trying to reduce crime in the community. The scheme, however, goes badly wrong. Disenchanted, Jimbo turns to another member and says \"Hey man, you've really let me down. Now I don't believe in anything anymore. I'm joining Law School\".</p> <p>Although law is sometimes portrayed as a dull discipline pursued by ethically dubious practitioners, it is a spellbindingly vivid and varied subject which affects every part of human life.</p> <p>Physics, history, Spanish, business, architecture, and other subjects are all vital disciplines but law permeates into every cell of social life. Law governs everything from the embryo to exhumation. Law regulates the air we breathe, the food and drink that we consume, our travel, sexuality, family relationships, our property, sport, science, employment, education, and health, everything in fact from neighbour disputes to war.</p> <p>A university law degree is the most adaptable of academic qualifications. Only people who want to become doctors study medicine whereas people with diverse career plans study law.</p> <p>Many law graduates, of course, do go on to become solicitors or barristers but, equally, many others use the qualification to become successful in companies, academic research, the media, the civil service, local government, teaching, campaign organisations, and politics - over 80 MPs, for example, have law degrees.</p> <p>Being educated in logical thinking, the articulate expression of complex ideas, the composition and art of argument, and how to use evidence and rules, law graduates have an excellent record of employability. A law degree can prepare someone for work at the highest levels \u2013 many world leaders are lawyers including Barack Obama. Other law graduates such as Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, Derren Brown, Gaby Logan, and Gerard Butler, chose different careers.</p> <p>Historically, legal education had a bad start. The law schools set up in London in the early thirteenth-century were banned in 1234 by a writ of Henry III. He thought trouble would come from people knowing the law. Later, it was the disciples of Jeremy Bentham who launched the first degree in English law, at University College London in 1826. The first graduating class of three was in 1839.</p> <p>Legal study develops organically in line with social needs. Today, areas of study and practice like sports law, media law, immigration law, human rights, and international criminal justice are very important, though they did not exist as recently as fifty years ago.</p> <p>Much legal study involves reading and discussing the decisions of appeal courts. Only particularly unusual cases are appealed so the law reports are brimming with interesting and unusual human dramas.</p> <p>There are over a million decisions you can study \u2013 reading them all, though, is not compulsory as your law lecturers appreciate the need for you also to engage in essential life-supporting activity such as sleep. You will learn many areas of law including the rules that determine whether a judge is being impartial, how contracts are made, and how careful the law requires people to be when they do everything including surgery, sport, science, and even manoeuvre during sex.</p> <p>The courts showcase a constant run of extraordinary and bizarre cases spanning eight hundred years, and there are many colourful decisions from other jurisdictions. Recent examples have included whether you can <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-04/05/content_560739.htm\" title=\"\">sell your soul on the internet</a>, a court order which forbade a man from laughing in public, a lawyer who tried to use <a href=\"http://t.co/x7QdkuW\" \">quotations from the film The Hangover</a> in arguing for his drunken client, another lawyer who was caught using Wikipedia for his arguments, and the question of whether a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6221540.stm\" \">vibrating condom is technically a contraceptive or a sex toy</a>.</p> <p>Law is an organic body of rules and good lawyers help to reshape it. As one judge, Lord Denning, noted in a case in 1954, just because something has never been argued before doesn't mean it is wrong. He said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"If we never do anything which has not been done before, we shall never get anywhere. The law will stand still while the rest of the world goes on: and that will be bad for both\".</p> </blockquote> <p>Knowing the law is empowering. The American comedian Jerry Seinfeld said that a lawyer is \"the person who knows the rules of the country\". He said \"we are all throwing the dice, playing the game, moving our pieces around the board, but if there is a problem the lawyer is the only person who has read the inside of the top of the box\". Controlling everything, law is a constantly stimulating and hugely important game.</p>",
  "<p>A gunman who killed six people at a Sikh place of worship in Wisconsin has been identified as a 40-year-old former soldier with alleged links to racist groups.</p> <p>The white, heavy-set shooter \u2013 who some witnesses suggested carried tattoos marking the 9/11 terrorist attacks \u2013 was named as Wade Michael Page, an former serviceman once stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. Officials have yet to confirm the killer's identity.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Southern Poverty Law Center \u2013 an organisation that monitors the activity of extremist groups \u2013 c<a href=\"http://www.splcenter.org/\">laimed on its website</a> that the shooter was a \"frustrated neo-Nazi who had been the leader of a racist white-power band\".</p> <p>Forensic experts spent Monday searching the gunman's home in Cudahy, just a few miles from Oak Creek, where the Sikh gurdwara is located.</p> <p>Oak Creek police chief John Edwards has already confirmed that the suspect had a military background. It is thought Page was dismissed from the US army in 1998 for \"patterns of misconduct\", including being drunk on duty.</p> <p>Edwards told CNN that the gunman \"lived in a community neighbouring ours\", and said authorities were \"doing a 24-hour back-check, just to get any idea what he was up to, what he was doing\".</p> <p>\"Right now there is no indication that there were any red flags,\" he said.</p> <p>Sunday's attack is being investigated as an act of \"domestic terrorism\", police have said.</p> <p>The suspect began shooting shortly before 10.30am local time as dozens gathered at the gurdwara. After killing people inside the building, the gunman fought with officers outside, critically injuring one. A second officer was able to \"put down\" the suspect, police said. The killer was pronounced dead at the scene.</p> <p>The wounded officer, named on Monday as lieutenant Brian Murphy, 51, a 21-year veteran of the force, was taken to hospital for surgery. He was in a critical condition on Monday.</p> <p>Emergency response teams found the bodies of four victims inside the gurdwara. Three more bodies lay outside the building, including that of the suspect. Three others \u2013 including the policeman \u2013 were injured and taken to a nearby hospital. All were said to be in a \"critical condition\".</p> <p>At a press conference on Sunday, Oak Creek police chief John Edwards said the \"heroic actions\" of the two officers \"stopped this from being worse than it could have been\".</p> <p>Authorities said the gunman had used a 9mm semi-automatic pistol. The weapon, recovered at the scene, is thought to have been obtained legally, but police are still trying to track its origin.</p> <p>Among those shot in the attack were prominent members of the local Sikh community. Jatin Der Mangat, 38, of Racine, said his uncle Satwant Singh Kaleka was one of those wounded, but he didn't know how serious his injuries were.</p> <p>\"It was like the heart just sat down,\" he said. \"This shouldn't happen anywhere.\"</p> <p>Sukhwindar Nagr, also of Racine, said he called his brother-in-law's phone. A granthi at the temple answered and told him that his brother-in-law had been shot, along with three granthi.</p> <p>It is thought that around 50 people were in the gurdwara at the time of the attack.</p> <p>The identification of the gunman has increased concerns that the attacker had a racist motive. The SPLC reported that Page was a known member of the white power music scene, and some witnesses said the suspect had a tattoo marking September 11. Some Sikhs had been targeted after 9/11, apparently mistaken for Muslims by people carrying out revenge attacks.</p> <p>Authorities confirmed the dead suspect had tattoos, but said they were not sure exactly what they illustrated.</p> <p>Police said it was too early to suggest a motive. But some Sikh members of the community told media that they feared that it was a hate crime. Others, however, have cautioned against jumping to conclusions.</p> <p>Sapreet Kaur, executive director of the Sikh Coalition, the largest Sikh American civil rights organisation in the US, said: \"There have been multiple hate crime shootings within the Sikh community in recent years and the natural impulse of our community is to unfortunately assume the same in this case.\"</p> <p>\"Let's let law enforcement investigate the case and as new facts emerge the dialogue can change.\"</p> <p>One woman, aged 41, and five men, including an 84-year-old, were killed in the attack, authorities said during a press conference on Monday.</p> <p>Police chief Edwards commended lieutenant Brian Murphy on his heroism as it emerged that he urged colleague to help others despite being seriously injured himself. Murphy was ambushed by the shooter as he went to tend to a wounded person. He was then shot eight or nine times at close range.</p> <p>But after the gunman was taken down buy a colleague, Murphy waved them away as they attempted to help him.</p> <p>\"He [Murphy] had been shot nine times, including very seriously in the neck area, and he waved them off and told them to go into the the temple to assist those in there,\" Edwards said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, some details about Wade were released by authorities.</p> <p>They confirmed his identity, and said: \"We can say he was in the military between 1992 and 1998, and had a general discharge and he was ineligible for re-enlistment.\"</p> <p>The FBI said that links to white supremacist groups were being looked into, but added that Wade had not been the subject of an investigation. But they were looking at references to him in other files, and he did have a police record, it emerged.</p> <p>The shooting came just 16 days after 12 people were killed and nearly 60 injured in a mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, during a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises.</p> <p>Wisconsin, like Colorado, has some of the most permissive gun laws in the country. Last year it passed a law allowing citizens to carry a concealed weapon.</p> <p>The second mass shooting in two weeks will likely intensify pressure on US lawmakers to address the issue gun controls. President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have been largely silent on guns.</p> <p>However, in a statement delivered after Sunday's shooting, Obama said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the incident.</p> <p>Words of condolences also came from leaders overseas, with Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh, a Sikh, expressing his shock and sadness.</p> <p>Singh said: \"That this senseless act of violence should be targeted at a place of religious worship is particularly painful.\"</p>",

A large extent. An extent so huge it almost obliterates anything else you might want to think or say about them. But there are two reasons why this might not be that bad: the Smiths were around so long ago, enough time might have elapsed for a band to emerge in their image; and really at the moment, give or take <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/26/new-band-spector\" title=\"\">Spector</a>, nobody else is doing this, so why can't they, to paraphrase the poet <a href=\"http://www.metrolyrics.com/everybody-elses-doing-it-so-why-cant-we-album-cranberries.html\" title=\"\">O'Riordan</a>. Plus, there's every chance that in doing it so well they make you forget about where they came from and wonder instead where it is they might be going.</p> <p>Whether the impetus to do this was boredom, insatiable desire or the then-imminent 30th anniversary of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/22/indie-record-labels-changed-world\" title=\"\">meeting of Morrissey and Marr</a> we don't know, but form Father Sculptor did at the end of 2011 in Glasgow, although apparently they recently returned to \"the north of England\", where four out of the five members have their homes, which we're guessing are within worshipping distance of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2012/mar/06/smiths-fans-salford-lads-club\" title=\"\">Salford Lads Club</a>. They played their first gig \u2013 with Spector, hardly coincidentally \u2013 on 15 February at King Tut's in Glasgow, after which they began recording tracks \u2013 in a bedroom, with one microphone \u2013 and sorting out all artwork and web design themselves. Oh, and they came up with a declaration of intent \u2013 \"Father Sculptor are mildly pleased to announce they will be the soundtrack to your birth, divorce &amp; death\" \u2013 that is so Morrissey (<a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/Art-Of-Noise-Into-Battle/master/331028\" title=\"\">via Paul Morley</a>) in its casually rampant self-belief, it's not true.</p> <p>There are quite a few tracks online, and they reveal a band with all the elements in place to cause a considerable stir. It's immediately clear from <a href=\"http://www.crackintheroad.com/music/17589-new-father-sculptor-aristide/\" title=\"\">Aristide</a> that languor is their energy, the lyrics (\"In between the sheets in which you sleep\", \"Could you just part those thighs?\") taking a Moz-ish delight in the sensuous everyday, toying with sex even as they recoil from it. The singer's voice is as mannered as you'd expect, veering from a mid-range yodel to a wilting falsetto, and the guitarist is quite Marr-vellous, achieving a range of textures, even if his tendency to break into a solo should probably be curtailed, being overly muscular and macho in this fey, winsome context \u2013 their catalogue so far comprises Smiths-ish ballads, not Queen Is Dead-style attacks. Frances finds a dark patch of middle ground between the Cult and the Smiths with its goth-lite miserablism. It's shockingly traditional, and startlingly 1984 \u2013 the 1984 that saw a drift back towards rock-band convention, not the New Order or Frankie Goes to Hollywood version of 1984 as a signpost towards a melancholic or bombastic electronic future.</p> <p>There is a nice guitar shimmer to <a href=\"http://fathersculptor.bandcamp.com/track/rhein\" title=\"\">Rhein</a>, and echo appears to be crucial to Father Sculptor, if not yet a crutch. Many will respond to their arrival with either silent prayer or noisy jubilation, some with weeping, others with scorn. Doubtless some will scoff at the familiarity of it all, and the solemnity. But you can certainly see this being greeted with an enormous sense of relief by a certain type of indie fan.

  "<p>Watching Nick Clegg delivering a speech or statement, I often itch to rewrite the script in order to make the deputy prime minister sound less full of righteous, injured innocence, the victim of his wicked political rivals' machinations. I felt it again today as Clegg stamped his foot on TV and promised revenge on the Tories over thwarted Lords reform.</p> <p>Will it break up the coalition? All sorts of excitable people will probably say so. I doubt it. It's only the latest of a series of rows since May 2010, not the most serious in my view, and both sides have too much at stake to precipitate an early rupture and dangerous election \u2013 at least over an issue such as this which most voters don't greatly care about.</p> <p>Chris Rennard, the party's veteran election strategist, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/03/failure-lords-reform-not-threaten-coalition\" title=\"\">thinks so too</a>, though it does create problems of party management for Clegg \u2013 \"you've been suckered, Nick\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/03/lords-reform-plan-questions-lib-dem\" title=\"\">as Patrick Wintour explained</a>.</p> <p>It's not that Clegg doesn't have a respectable case for creating a largely elected second chamber \u2013 many people have shared that goal for a century or more. Likewise electoral reform for the Commons, subject of the ill-fated and ill-judged AV referendum which David Cameron conceded to his Lib Dem coalition partners last year against the wishes of party.</p> <p>Other people can and do make perfectly respectable arguments against either the principle or the details of both reforms. It doesn't make them wicked. By the same token some Tories, certainly No 10, think the current electoral system is structurally unfair to them because it takes more votes to elect a Conservative MP than it does a Labour one.</p> <p>It's not hard to argue for or against that one either. Until this afternoon Clegg was arguing in favour of the reform. Now he's promising to block implementation of the boundary commission changes that reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600, in more equal-sized constituencies too, as retaliation for the 91 Tory MPs who voted against second reading of the Lords reform.</p> <p>They also joined forces with Labour to prevent the detailed stage of the bill's passage being railroaded through, as Clegg himself would put it if it suited him. I'm not sure that voters, who rarely care much about constitutional reform \u2013 which they rightly suspect to be a middle-class panacea for our political woes \u2013 will be impressed by the Lib Dems voting against the new boundaries once all the work has been completed, expensive and disruptive as it is.</p> <p>Clegg was on better ground there at his press conference (who chose that eggshell-blue background with the gold thread? Very elitist!) when he repeatedly said he could accept Labour's proposal to take more time over the Lords bill at a time when the government has so many more important issues to tackle. His own priority is the creation of a fairer society, he repeated. Good.</p> <p>Trouble is that though all three major party manifestos were committed to Lords reform in 2010, everyone knows that they've been haggling over very important details for a decade since Tony Blair expelled all but 92 hereditary peers; for 100 years if you prefer. Forty-three years ago Michael Foot and Enoch Powell formed an unholy alliance to block reform: Foot wanted abolition, Powell the status quo.</p> <p>In 2012 plenty of MPs and peers in all parties are privately sceptical about boundary changes (50 MPs will lose their seats, proportionately more Lib Dems than Labour or Tory); the AV model of electoral reform (it could produce even greater distortions); and the coalition's much amended plans to create a largely elected second chamber. Just listen to Lord (Alex) Carlile, a Lib Dem lawyer, ex-MP and peer, sticking the boot into the \"not well thought-out\" proposals on Radio 4's World at One today.</p> <p>The central flaws in the bill are twofold: despite assurances that the primacy of the Commons will be retained, an elected Lords is bound to assert its new legitimacy as a democratic house, precisely the legitimacy Clegg himself asserts; and how does he square the independence/accountability conundrum via a single 15-year term for peer/senators? Fifteen years is a long time in which to jump ship or otherwise run amok amid wider gridlock between the two elected houses.</p> <p>Clegg argued today that Lords reform was part of the coalition agreement's package of constitutional reforms over which Tory MPs could be allowed to pick and choose while Lib Dems remained loyal to the \"contract\" of 2010. That strikes me as both priggish and naive, a bit like David Steel protesting to Jim Callaghan in 1978 when Labour failed to deliver on the Lib-Lab pact's promise to provide proportional representation (PR) on elections to the European parliament.</p> <p>Michael Foot's promise to \"use my best endeavours\" could have been borrowed by Cameron. When PR eventually arrived for EU elections it proved more helpful to Ukip than to the Lib Dems. The law of unintended consequences usually stalks high-minded constitutional reform. Remember how we were assured that no one party would ever be able to win a majority at Holyrood?</p> <p>Clegg's last justification for derailing the boundary commission proposals ahead of 2015 is that it was part of a package that would deliver a smaller, more democratic Commons as well as a smaller elected Lords. To do otherwise would be a victory for the executive \u2013 for \"over-mighty government\" \u2013 he insists.</p> <p>Well, if you say so, Nick. But a reform which cuts the number of backbench MPs by 50 but does not cap the number of ministers could well be seen as a victory for over-mighty government in itself. Clegg will get over it, as he did the defeat over AV, and the coalition will stagger on towards 2015, increasingly disaffected with each other, but not divorced.</p> <p>It's the economy that will decide its fate, not Lords reform.</p>",
  "<p>The US is helping the Philippines to modernise and improve its military capability in the face of a growing confrontation with China over supremacy in the South China Sea.</p> <p>The Americans have already agreed to transfer two naval vessels to an underpowered Philippine navy, and deployment of fighter jets, a coastal radar system and even increased numbers of American troops on the ground in the Philippines are under discussion.</p> <p>The Philippines has several territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea, and while all sides know its armed forces will never be a match for China, the military moves are designed to give the country a \"minimum credible defence position\", officials say.</p> <p>The US has transferred to its Pacific ally two decommissioned coastguard ships. The first, the Gregorio del Pilar, arrived August 2011 and replaced a second world war vessel as the Philippine navy's biggest and newest ship. The second is expected to arrive this year.</p> <p>Officials familiar with defence and security policy have told the Guardian this may be the beginning of an era of greater military co-operation. Rodolfo Biazon, chair of the Philippine house committee on national defence, told the Guardian there were plans to buy \"big-ticket items for the air force and navy\".</p> <p>Lieutenant Colonel Miko Okol, spokesman for the Philippine air force, says surface attack aircraft, attack helicopters, long-range patrol aircraft and radar are among the items already approved for purchase and soon to be put up for bid. He says, \"I cannot give you a specific, like a specific aircraft, or what country we're gonna get them from. But these are the things we will be getting in the next two or three years.\"</p> <p>A request for a squadron of F-16 aircraft has been made to US defence officials, but Okol is unsure of where it will lead: \"We have told officials we would like to get these items as part of the things we might ask them [for] in terms of our defence co-operation with them\".</p> <p>The Philippines may also receive help in upgrading its military equipment from US allies such as Japan, South Korea and Australia. Ricky Carandang, the presidential communications secretary, says that talks are being held with Japan to acquire 12 patrol boats for the coastguard. The US is also understood to be considering increasing its troop presence from current levels of around 600.</p> <p>The developments come as the scramble intensifies for control of the South China Sea, a crucial expanse of ocean with coastline in China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei.</p> <p>China has been asserting its military power in recent years, claiming territorial rights over Scarborough Shoal and other island groupings deep in the 200-mile maritime exclusion. Smaller regional powers have felt cowed in the face of a superpower flexing its muscles, and are turning to the other global superpower for support.</p> <p>But Carandang says territorial issues are not the main reason for the drive to upgrade military capability. \"If you look at our configurations, there is always a focus on primarily fighting internal threats since the late Marcos era,\" he explains. \"Basically, we have allowed our external defence capabilities to deteriorate. Whether or not there was an issue with China, there was that need and the president recognised it.\"</p> <p>Prof Rommel Banlaoi, vice president of the Philippine Association for Chinese Studies, mentions the other threats which would be reasons for the country to build up its maritime domain: \"It can also mean against other international terrorist groups, maritime pirates, smugglers of arms, drug smugglers, human traffickers, and other forms of transnational organised crimes using the South China Sea, the Celebes Sea, the Sulu Sea.\"</p> <p>But Banlaoi says access to the sea lanes in the South China Sea is also an issue. Although the US says it does not take a position on competing territorial claims, it does have an interest in maintaining freedom of navigation in the area for American ships, whether military, civilian or commercial.</p> <p>\"In my opinion the US is doing this because of the China challenge,\" says Banlaoi. \"Of course it will not admit it \u2013 the US also has interests in keeping a cordial relationship with China as an economic power. The US fears that if China increases its influence in the area then it will affect the unhampered use of the waters in the South China Sea.\"</p> <p>According to Banlaoi, the support given to America's former colony is part of President Obama's \"pivot towards Asia\" is an attempt to strengthen all its existing alliances in Asia- including Australia, Japan, South Korea and Thailand.</p> <p>Banlaoi says that the Philippines needs the assistance most: \"Among American allies in Asia the Philippines is the only country with no credible capabilities. We are very ill equipped, in fact the Philippines is what I call belonging to the weakest link in the US alliances in Asia.\"</p> <p>The United States is also assisting the Philippines with a system to better monitor the archipelago's Western coast. Details as to the timeframe of such a project are unclear but according to Carandang, \"It's going on ..its moving, it's happening.\"</p> <p>Rep. Biazon details the form such assistance might come in: \"You need not only the radar systems, but including communication systems. You can't operate the aircraft without a radar. That will be part of the package. And probably even armaments.\"</p> <p>But debate exists as to whether or not these efforts to modernize the military with new equipment will really make a difference.</p> <p>Neri Colmenares, party list representative for the leftist Bayan Muna movement, believes efforts to make Philippines defence \"credible\" are in vain and will only serve to increase dependence on the US: \"We can spent a hundred years' budget on the armed forces of the Philippines and it will not make our defence credible against China,\" he says. \"An increase in budget or capabilities is not the way forward&#xa0;\u2026 because the armed forces itself has not been reformed. It's still a corrupt and politicised body.\"</p> <p>Academics such as professor Benito Lim, a China specialist who teaches political science at Ateneo de Manila University, questions the sincerity of American help, pointing out that China's defence system is stronger than all the military weaponry of the Asean countries combined.</p> <p>Referring to the Gregorio del Pilar, which was stripped of most of its weapons, he says: \"Suppose the Americans know that China owns a machine gun, but they give the Philippines a kitchen knife \u2013 it makes the Philippines look ridiculous when confronted with the Chinese in the Scarborough Shoal.</p> <p>\"Suppose they see Chinese ships enter the area of the contested islands.

  "<p>On Friday afternoon, Lucy Bradshaw, the general manager of games studio Maxis, <a href=\"http://www.ea.com/news/eamaxis-sue-zynga-for-copyright-infringement\">posted a message on the site of her publisher, Electronic Arts</a>. The company would be filing a lawsuit against social gaming giant Zynga for copyright infringement, alleging that Zynga's Facebook game The Ville is a direct copy of EA's own Sims Social. The blog post was angry, passionate and determined, ending with the following declaration:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As a longstanding game developer, I know what it feels like to pour your heart and soul into creating something unique and special for your fans to enjoy. Today, we hope to be taking a stand that helps the industry protect the value of original creative works and those that work tirelessly to create them.</p> </blockquote> <p>Later, US game site Joystiq <a href=\"http://www.joystiq.com/2012/08/03/highlights-from-eas-lawsuit-against-zynga/\">reproduced the legal document in full</a>. In it, Electronic Arts has pinpointed a range of significant similiarities between the two games, with certain animations, gameplay elements and virtual goods highlighted via screenshot sequences. The accompnying text is unequivocal:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Zynga's The Ville, released on June 26, 2012, is an unmistakable copy of EA's The Sims Social. Not only does The Ville blatantly mimic the entire framework and style of gameplay in The Sims Social, but it so closely copies the original, creative expression and unique elements of The Sims Social \u2013 ie, the animation sequences, visual arrangements, characters' motions and actions, and other unique audio-visual elements \u2013 that the two games are nearly indistinguishable.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is, of course, not the first time that such accusations have been levelled against Zynga. The company has faced legal action from developer SocialApps over the similarities between its own title myFarm and Zynga's Farmville. And in 2009, the creator of the Facebook mafia sim Mob Wars sued Zynga for copyright infringement, due to the latter's comparable title, Mafia Wars. Last year, the Learning Company <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2011/05/19/houghton-sues-zynga-over-oregon-trail.html\">took legal action against Zynga</a>, alleging that the use of the phrase Oregon Trail in Zynga's Frontierville title infringed its copyright.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.scribd.com/embeds/101959497/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=list\"> <a title=\"View EA v Zynga Complaint Final on Scribd\" href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/101959497\" style=\"margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block; text-decoration: underline;\">EA v Zynga Complaint Final</a><iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/101959497/content?start_page=1&view_mode=list\" data-auto-height=\"true\" data-aspect-ratio=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_68110\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In the past, Zynga has always defended its approach to genre iteration. When Gamesblog interviewed company chief executive Mark Pincus recently, he said: \"We don't believe companies should appropriate other people's artwork. But we don't believe that companies have any ownership on a category or a genre just because they were first or more popular.\"</p> <p>True enough, the company has issued a statement vigorously defending itself against EA's accusation, with Zynga's general counsel declaring:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's unfortunate that EA thought that this was an appropriate response to our game, and clearly demonstrates a lack of understanding of basic copyright principles. It's also ironic that EA brings this suit shortly after launching SimCity Social which bears an uncanny resemblance to Zynga's CityVille game. Nonetheless, we plan to defend our rights to the fullest extent possible and intend to win with players.</p> </blockquote> <p>So, is there a case? Despite EA's wealth of compelling evidence, it's far from certain. The criteria for copyright infringement cases are stringent and complex. Game concepts cannot be copyrighted and a selection of graphical similarities between two games would not usually be enough to prove such a claim. Even major gameplay similarities wouldn't be sufficient \u2013 unless it can be proven that a developer has effectively stolen the original source code of another company, which is not the case being brought here.</p> <p>\"In the case of video games, copying functionality does not amount to copyright infringement,\" says Alex Chapman of media law firm Sheridans. \"Where successful claims could be brought is in the area of artistic copyright, which protects the visual appearance of the game. In most titles that is very difficult to prove because when you are simulating real-world objects there are going to be similarities in how those are represented. It would have to be an infringement of a very specific art style \u2013 for example, the look of Habbo Hotel, which is very distinctive. But even then, you have to show that a developer has reproduced a <em>substantial</em> part of the original artistic work.\"</p> <p>The problem is in defining exactly how unique all of the elements highlighted by EA actually are. \"The isometric view is commonplace, it's shared by hundreds of games \u2013 it's not original to any EA title,\" says Chapman. \"Also, it's a girl getting in to bed \u2013 is that an infringement? How else could you represent that in a 2.5D view? The fact that there are several similarities does not make a difference \u2013 copyright law does not protect the overall feel of a game. I think this case will illustrate how difficult it is for rights holders to protect their products against clones.\"</p> <p>One possible angle for EA may be in the similarity between whole animated sequences. In this sense, the company could argue that Zynga has infringed a dramatic work, rather than a single still image, which could lead to a copyright claim \u2013 but again, it would depend on the uniqueness of the sequence in question. A girl getting in to bed might not be enough.</p> <p>It's certainly an interesting and compelling case, however, complicated by the fact that Zynga employs several designers recruited from Maxis including Jenny Martin and Chris Trottier, once a lead designer on The Sims. EA is unlikely to put time and financial resources behind a case it has no possibility of winning, but this also feels like something of a creative rebuke to Zynga. There will certainly be plenty of schadenfreude directed at the social gaming company, which has based its model on 'iterating' established genres and genre leaders.</p> <p>And will a victory for EA be a nail in the coffin of clone culture? Chapman is unconvinced. \"This case will probably just illustrate how difficult it is for developers to prevent the creation of clones and if it doesn't then it will just tell the industry that Zynga went too far. There is a point at which there is no infringement and future clone developers will make sure they go as far as that line without crossing it.\"</p> <p>There are possibly also question marks over the use of such legal action in the games development field. Maxis has put forward a strong, highly charged case and the need to protect the innovations of developers is vital, especially in this era of smaller studios competing against vast corporations. But the line between copying and iteration can be fuzzy, and if a precedence is set it won't just be controversial companies like Zynga that are affected.</p> <p>\"Overall, while I am keen not to prejudge anything, the point is that the industry is built on the concept of copying without infringing,\" says Chapman. \"And there is a very significant difference between 'copying' and 'copyright infringement'. </p> <p>\"If you look at video games from the beginning, had the law allowed all developers and publishers to enforce the rights in functionality or feel from day one, we probably would have found that there could be no innovation in the industry. If the law allowed the creators of Space Invaders, Pong, Pac-Man and Doom to retain sufficient rights, games that borrowed mechanics from those titles would never have come about. The industry is built on the concept of innovation through iteration, and that's what Zynga will claim that it's doing.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Guardian has approached both EA and Zynga for comment, and will update this story when they reply.</em></p>",

Photograph: NASA/JPL-Caltech </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NASA/JPL-Caltech</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>About an hour before Curiosity touched the Martian surface, <a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/about/bio_elachi.cfm\">Charles Elachi</a>, director of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, stepped outside. He looked up at the red dot of Mars in the nighttime sky and imagined what was about to happen. The dream turned into reality.</p> <p>At 6:14am (UK time) Curiosity landed on Mars. The riskiest touchdown yet attempted on the red planet had worked. The explosion of joy and the tears of relief in the control room said it all. Deep down many had feared for this landing, and their liberation was palpable.</p> <p>It is not by accident that space missions succeed. It takes years of planning and expert effort. Today we also learned that it's down to the peanuts. Yes, peanuts. </p> <p>By tradition, the snack was handed out in the control room just minutes before Curiosity hit the Martian atmosphere at six kilometres per second to begin its <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/video/2012/aug/03/curiosity-terror-nasa-mars-video\">seven minutes of terror</a>, as the landing manoeuvre was called.</p> <p>Such traditions are <a href=\"http://www.stuartclark.com/podcasts-and-videos/113-russian-astronaut-rituals\">commonplace in human spaceflight</a>. They are things the astronauts <em>have</em> to do before take-off. But in most cases, they serve no purpose other than to do what others have done before.</p> <p>Thanks to the continuous online coverage from <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/user/NASAtelevision\">Nasa TV</a>, we saw that unmanned spaceflight is evolving its own set of traditions. Through these, we can glimpse the human side of these bold missions. It drives home that those in charge are every bit as nervous as we would imagine them to be.</p> <p>The traditions also serve another function: they help to kill time. The entire entry, decent and landing is autonomous. The controllers are there for the ride. So, what better way to break the tension and calm the nerves than to perform a ritual. And what better way to acknowledge the unscientific nature of such superstitious behaviour than to make them tongue-in-cheek. Hence, the peanuts.</p> <p>In 1967, Nasa's Ranger 7 became the first US spacecraft to successfully transmit close-up images of the moon's surface back to Earth. Amid the triumph, someone noticed that one of the ground controllers was nervously munching on a packet of peanuts. They decided that this must be the reason why all their previous attempts to photograph the moon had failed.</p> <p>So now, before a landing or planetary arrival is attempted, peanuts are passed around the crew to \"ensure\" success.</p> <p>Today, they were in a jar labelled \"dare mighty things\". The phrase was taken from Theodore Roosevelt's quote, \"Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs even though checkered by failure, than to rank with those timid spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much because they live in the grey twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat.\"</p> <p>The choice is an apt reminder that everyone was braced for failure. The landing was risky by necessity because it was designed to place the rover close to Mount Sharp, where geologists believe they will find the history of Mars' <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/across-the-universe/2012/aug/03/mars-curiosity-rover-nasa-gale-crater\">past climate written in the rocks</a>. To do this they used a previously untried hovering retro-rocket platform called the Sky Crane. </p> <p>If Curiosity had failed, Nasa would now be facing disaster.</p> <p>The Mars programme in America has deep financial problems. Earlier this year, Nasa was forced to pull out of a collaboration with the European Space Agency to send the <a href=\"http://exploration.esa.int/science-e/www/area/index.cfm?fareaid=118\">ExoMars</a> orbiter and rover to Mars in 2016 and 2018 respectively. The 2018 mission would have used another Sky Crane for the landing. Now, Esa is looking to the Russians as partners and Nasa has no funding for another rover mission, although alternatives are being investigated.</p> <p>That uncertain future makes Curiosity invaluable. It is the biggest, most capable rover that has ever landed on Mars. At the press briefing following the success, <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/webcasts/elv/theisingerP-bio.html\">Peter Theisinger</a>, the project manager, said that Curiosity was a priceless asset and that Nasa was not going to \"screw it up\". That means they will take their time with it and do things properly. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.gps.caltech.edu/people/grotz/profile\">John Grotzinger</a>, project scientist, said that it might even take a year to get to the foot of Mountt Sharp because there is so much good science to be had as they analyse the rocks en route.</p> <p>Just after the press conference, the landing team handed over the operation of Curiosity to the surface team. This involved another tradition. The voyage to Mars took 254 days. On launch day, back in late November last year, the flight team bought two large jars and 254 marbles. At the end of every day, the flight director, moved one marble from the first jar to the second. </p> <p>Today, Entry, Descent and Landing Engineer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/steltzner\">Adam Steltzner</a>, the architect of today's audacious landing, moved the final marble, and gave both jars to the surface crew. </p> <p>There are now another 600 plus marbles to be moved for the science mission, designed to last about two Earth years. If all remains well with Curiosity at the end of that time, there will be more marbles after that.</p> <p>But forget all the tongue-in-cheek stuff, the marbles and the peanuts, there is another tradition that is taking shape here: that of landing safely on Mars. Let the science begin and let us hope that Nasa secures the funding to keep the tradition alive.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.stuartclark.com/\">Stuart Clark</a> is the author of <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781846972157\">The Sky's Dark Labyrinth</a> trilogy (Polygon)</em></p>",

Siberia's Gilyaks used to capture a bear cub and treat it like an honoured guest, walking it, cleaning it and feeding it royally. Japan's Ainu people went a step further. They too would adopt a cub; if it had difficulty chewing its carefully prepared food, an Ainu mother would <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3628594?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21100959787403\" title=\"\">suckle it from her own breast</a>. Against this background, our own cult of the furry fellow starts to look relatively restrained.</p> <p>So what is this thing we've got about bears? Unlike most other mammals, they can rear up on their hind legs. This gives them something in common with human beings, even if they tend to adopt this posture when attacking us. Their omnivorous diet, including a penchant for honey and berries, helps make it easy to anthropomorphise them.</p> <p>In Seth MacFarlane's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148370/ted\" title=\"Ted, 2012\">Ted</a>, Mark Wahlberg's eponymous co-star never gets down on all fours. His face is flattened so that, unlike some of his stuffed peers and all of their natural counterparts, he always enjoys full binocular vision. Yet if we're looking for a surrogate human to cherish, why didn't we choose a primate?</p> <p>Perhaps the key to our lovable teddy's appeal lies in the very savagery in which we know his real-life ilk luxuriate. Wahlberg's eight-year-old John Bennett forges his lifelong bond with Ted because he's a bullied Billy No-mates. He requires unconditional love from something both kind and strong. In our own species, these two qualities are found in combination less frequently than we might wish. So we've taken advantage of our exclusive ability to fantasise, to implant them into our teddies. It works for John, and it seems to work for the rest of us as well.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Read Emily and Olivia's summing up and Storify of Day One <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/aug/05/olympics-sheffield-jessica-jess-ennis\">here.</a></strong></p> <p>As the sun sets over the Don Valley Complex on Sunday evening, Sheffield can certainly be proud of its brand new festival prot\u00e9g\u00e9. </p> <p>With a total of 20,000 people singing, dancing, eating and drinking their way through the festival weekend, <a href=\"http://www.sheftival.com/\">Sheftival</a> can safely say it's made it's mark on the South Yorkshire festival scene.</p> <p>After a rip-roaring start on Saturday, with the likes of Ryan O'Shaughnessy, Laura Steel and Toots &amp; The Maytals gracing the stages, Sunday was a quieter affair. But the sense of camaraderie and sunshine and Yorkshire's Olympic glory (7th in the medal table, were we an independent country) ensured that the excitement and enthusiasm was carried over to the festival's final day. </p> <p>After Sheffield's Jessica Ennis sealed that well-deserved heptathlon gold with her performance in the 800m race on Saturday night, it was difficult to envisage how the same level of Olympic excitement could be fostered for the festival's second day. But, GB tennis star Andy Murray wowed the crowds once more by beating Wimbledon champion Roger Federer in straight sets, He may be a Scot, but everyone was glued to the screen at the Don Valley stadium. </p> <p>And the athletes weren't the only ones working hard this weekend, as hundreds of children tried out twenty-five different sports at Ennis' home training ground. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorbing\">Zorbing </a>was one of them, allowing intrepid participants to launch themselves downhill in a giant plastic orb (rather you than us). Those less adventurous could opt for a game of football. But they'd have to deal with playing on an inflatable pitch\u2026</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394246139\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/6/1344260812676/SarahMac.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Mac at Sheftival\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Mac on the Buskers Barge. Fine hat and it didn't matter about the keyboard stand...</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Festival Director Dave Healy said</p> <blockquote> <p>What made Sheftival unique was the combination of sport and music. The participation in sport has been a real success, who know, maybe we have just inspired the next Jess Ennis.</p> </blockquote> <p>All the while, everyone taking part in sports was racking up stamps on their Sheftival Activities Passport, competing for Browse, Silver or Gold prizes. After the exercise, it was time for a culinary re-charge, and Sheftival wasn't about to disappoint. Hungry punters filled their bellies with treats from across the globe; sampling cuisine from dozens of stalls set up throughout the complex, from stone-baked pizzas to a mouth-watering Jamaican Jerk BBQ tent. Not to mention Ostrich Burgers and Curried Goat-yum. </p> <p>Another contributor to the festival's identity was the unmistakable cartoon branding on tickets, posters and t-shirts across the city. This was all thanks to local design company <a href=\"http://www.peterandpaul.co.uk/\">Peter and Paul</a> (no nursery rhyme jokes, please). They were most recently responsible for design work on Kid Acne's 'South Yorks', Toddla T's merch and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/jul/24/tramslines-festival-sheffield-music\">Tramlines Music Festival</a>. Their work made Sheftival instantly recognisable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394246140\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/6/1344260892315/Poster.jpg\" alt=\"Sheftival poster\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>But Sunday's big highlight was the Dodgy secret gig on the 'Buskers Barge', treating passengers to an hour of nostalgic '90s hits down the canal, such as 'Good Enough' and 'Staying Out For The Summer.' Opening for the band was local solo artist Sarah Mac. With an air of modesty, she confessed with a meek smile and soft Sheffield twang, to having forgotten her keyboard stand. At which point the furry-hatted songstress launched into her first ballad, singing and playing piano with the depth and maturity of someone who's been in the biz for decades. </p> <p>As they came off, people were instantly drawn to the Jetty Side Stage, to hear an entire brass band playing Human League's 'Don't You Want Me'. Only in Sheffield. </p> <p>The sounds of reggae and ska dominated the musical side of the festival complimenting its relaxed atmosphere and family-friendly environment. And Kanda Bonga Man, Macka B and The Beat took to the stage on Sunday to deliver just that. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394246141\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/6/1344260952138/barge.jpg\" alt=\"Dodgy at Sheftival\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dodgy on the barge - '90s nostalgia along the cut</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other local acts were The Crookes, who performed a late night session on the Buskers Barge with See Emily Play and In Fear of Olive. </p> <p>And finally, Brit pop act Lightning Seeds brought Sheftival to a crescendo of a close. And it was clear that both Olympic glory and fantastic music was Coming Home. </p> <p><em><strong>Emily Brinnand</strong> is a freelance multimedia journalist, producer and broadcaster.

  "<p>Tens of thousands of jobseekers have had their benefits stripped unlawfully and are likely to be entitled to a rebate following a high court ruling on Monday, lawyers have said.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/aug/06/unpaid-work-scheme-ruled-lawful-poundland\" title=\"\">judicial review</a>, claims by two jobseekers that the government's back-to-work schemes amounted to \"forced labour\" were rejected. They also failed to persuade a judge that the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) had failed to publish enough official information about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/feb/22/unemployment-work-programme-welfare\" title=\"\">the schemes</a> for them to be lawful.</p> <p>However, in a 50-page ruling, Mr Justice Foskett said that a letter sent out by the DWP to a 41-year-old benefit claimant did not conform to its own rules on providing clear information, making his six-month benefit sanction for failing to work unpaid for 26 weeks unlawful.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.publicinterestlawyers.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Lawyers acting for Jamieson Wilson</a>, an unemployed lorry driver who was forced to live on handouts from family and friends after the DWP stripped him of all benefits, say the ruling will affect tens of thousands of jobseekers who have been sanctioned after being sent the same or similar letters and many should therefore be entitled to a rebate.</p> <p>Following the ruling, the DWP confirmed that it had changed its sanction letters but denied any fault, and said it would be appealing against the judgment and contest any rebate claims.</p> <p>The DWP said: \"We don't think there's anything wrong with our letters, and believe they are both clear and concise.</p> <p>\"We will appeal this decision. However, given the judgment we have revised the wording of our standard letters.\"</p> <p>In the written judgment, Foskett ruled that the DWP's standard letter sent out to Wilson was not sufficiently clear and precise to comply with the governments own regulations concerning benefit sanctions.</p> <p>\"It should not be necessary,\" he said, \"[for those on the receiving end of a letter to] \"ferret around for what for most people would be inaccessible regulations to find out his or her position.\"</p> <p>Declaring Wilson's eventual six-month benefit sanction following his refusal to participate in what he called \"forced labour\" unlawful, Foskett said: \"There could be no question of sanctions being validly imposed if no proper notice of the sanction consequences was given.\"</p> <p>The DWP told the Guardian that the same or similar letters have been sent to tens of thousands of benefit claimants but could not yet give <a href=\"http://83.244.183.180/sanction/sanction/LIVE/tabtool.html\" title=\"\">exact numbers</a> on how many people they judged to be affected by the ruling.</p> <p>Foskett also rejected a claim by Cait Reilly, a 23-year-old geology graduate, that a scheme requiring her to work for free at a Poundland discount store breached Article IV of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits forced labour and slavery.</p> <p>Foskett said that \"characterising such a scheme as involving or being analogous to 'slavery' or 'forced labour' seems to me to be a long way from contemporary thinking\".</p> <p>Wilson and Reilly, who <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">first contacted the Guardian with her concerns about government schemes last year</a>, had also argued that the government had failed to publish any official information about the schemes so their clients were unable to understand what their real responsibilities were and what they were compelled to do without falling foul of the rules.</p> <p>During the case the DWP admitted that mistakes had been made in notifying Reilly about the requirements of the Sector Based Work Academy Scheme she was sent on, which meant she had to work unpaid for six weeks included stacking and cleaning shelves in Poundland.</p> <p>Rejecting the main forced labour allegations, the judge said both the schemes under challenge \"are a very long way removed from the kind of colonial exploitation of labour that led to the formulation of Article 4.</p> <p>\"The [human rights] convention is, of course, a living instrument, capable of development to meet modern conditions, and views may reasonably differ about the merits of a scheme that requires individuals to 'work for their benefits' as a means of assisting them back into the workplace.\"</p> <p>The judge added: \"Whether the problems in Miss Reilly's case and Mr Wilson's case were 'merely teething problems' remains to be seen.\"</p> <p>The DWP said: \"We are delighted, although not surprised, that the judge agrees our schemes are not forced labour.</p> <p>\"Comparing our initiatives to slave labour is not only ridiculous but insulting to people around the world facing real oppression.\"</p> <p>She added that the scheme was making a real difference to people's lives. \"Those who oppose this process are actually opposed to hard work and they are harming the life chances of unemployed young people who are trying to get on.\"</p> <p>however, the judge also quashed any impression that either of the claimants were \"benefit scroungers\".</p> <p>\"In relation to Miss Reilly and to Mr Wilson it is important that it is appreciated that each has been actively looking for work: they have not taken their objections to the overall scheme as a means of avoiding employment and seeking simply to rely on benefits,\" he said.</p> <p>Public Interest Lawyers, representing Wilson and Reilly, said they would also appeal against the ruling to a higher court.</p> <p>Wilson said: \"I am pleased that the DWP's decision to strip me of my benefits for six months had been found to be unlawful.</p> <p>\"It has been very difficult for me to live without my jobseekers allowance since May. I hope that I and all the thousands of others who have had their benefits unlawfully removed will now be quickly reimbursed.\"</p> <p>PIL solicitor Tessa Gregory said the issuing of unlawful warning letters meant that \"tens of thousands of people stripped of their benefits must now be entitled to reimbursement by the DWP\".</p> <p>PIL added: \"Today's decision should mean that many of those subjected to benefit sanctions will be entitled to reimbursement by the Department of Work and Pensions.</p> <p>\"It is truly extraordinary that the government has found itself in this position by failing to provide basic information to those affected.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nawra.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Association of Welfare Rights Advisers</a> called on the government to launch an urgent review. It said: \"It's a disgrace that people have had benefits stopped because of misleading information routinely issued by the DWP. The DWP must now urgently review all such cases. Sanctions plunge people into severe hardship and advisers see the harm that sanctions cause to claimants and their families.\"</p>",

  "<p>It started out as an adventurous plan to open a restaurant in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sudan\" title=\"\">Sudan</a>.</p> <p>But by the time Magdy el-Baghdady, a young Briton from north London, left the country, he had been imprisoned for more than two months, beaten, tortured, tried and even subjected to mock execution, and finally prevented from leaving the country for almost a year.</p> <p>\"It was a brutal experience that has changed my life,\" he reflected. \"At times I thought I would not get out alive.\"</p> <p>Baghdady's misfortune was to be identified by Sudanese security forces as an activist intent on fomenting revolution in a country determined to resist the upheaval roiling its northern neighbours, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt\" title=\"\">Egypt</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/libya\" title=\"\">Libya</a>.</p> <p>\"I was sitting in the flat I had just rented in Khartoum when they raided,\" he told the Guardian. Blindfolded and with his feet shacked, Baghdady was taken to the headquarters of Sudan's national intelligence and security services (NISS) in Khartoum where he was interrogated before being transferred to the political remand centre at the notorious <a href=\"http://www.enoughproject.org/blogs/detainee-recounts-ordeal-sudan%E2%80%99s-notorious-kober-prison\" title=\"\">Kober prison</a>.</p> <p>\"The NISS put me in a chair in the middle of a room with interrogators surrounding me,\" he recalled. \"One man, my height but extremely well built, held me by the hair. He had his left hand on the table in front of me while his right hand held the back of my head to drive it into the table.\"</p> <p>They insisted that the 30-year-old was not British, despite his passport. \"This man demanded I speak Arabic to them, pulling my hair so violently that it tore. I was extremely distraught.\"</p> <p>It did not help Baghdady that his mother was Polish. \"Once I told them that I do not speak Arabic and I spoke Polish as the second language they said I therefore must be a Jew.\"</p> <p>But the most serious accusation was that Baghdady had links to the pro-democracy movements that have been sweeping across the region and intended to take the Arab spring to Sudan. In mid-February 2011, when he was arrested, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/11/hosni-mubarak-resigns-egypt-cairo\" title=\"\">events in neighbouring Egypt </a>had already put Omar al-Bashir's regime on alert and in a state of paranoia about foreigners in the country.</p> <p>Baghdady had gone to the city of Omdurman to see a friend, Omar al-Mahdi, the nephew of a former prime minister who he supposed would be well-placed to help him set up his catering business. Mahdi was arrested at the same time.</p> <p>For a period of eight days, Baghdady and his friend were taken from jail every day to NISS headquarters for interrogation. The beatings and kickings usually came before and after those long sessions, he said.</p> <p>\"The day after our arrest, men came to the cell, blindfolded and shackled us outside the cell, and beat us with plastic pipes directly outside the transfer office,\" he said. \"I was facing a wall, Omar was on my right. They beat us from behind, made sounds as they struck us, not words. They beat my right shoulder, the right side of my ribs, and across my right thigh. I fell to the floor. I tried to use my cuffed arms to protect myself. I was blindfolded so I could not see the strikes coming. The anticipation was worse than the blow.\"</p> <p>One the fourth day, Baghdady and Mahdi were held against a wall by a firing squad. \"A gunman pressed the muzzle of his weapon on the back of my head just above my neck, he pressed the gun into me. I knew all men had the same thing happen to them.</p> <p>\"The senior officer standing on the wall shouted an order. All the men cocked their weapons once. I heard whimpering from the prisoners, then complete silence. That was the most intimidating moment. I dare not move my muscles. The gun never left the back of my head. The high ranking officer shouted another command, and the guns were cocked a second time. Omar said: 'It's empty, it's empty, it's empty.'\"</p> <p>It was later that Baghdady realised it was a mock execution; an intimidating tactic also used against many other fellow prisoners, including Mohamed Nour Khalil, an opposition figure.</p> <p>The worst beating came on the last of the eight days he was held. \"I was dragged from outside the cell by my arms. The man dragging me stamped on my right foot with the heel of his boot. I fractured my foot across the second and third toe area. It has never healed. My right achilles tendon area has a skin cut from the shackle, and there are two cigarette burns on my left foot. They also kicked us in the testicles.\"</p> <p>The British government has demanded a rapid investigation. \"We continue to press on this matter,\" an Foreign Office spokesperson said. \"We are deeply concerned by Mr El-Baghdady's allegations that he was mistreated during his detention.\"</p> <p>A senior official at the Sudanese ministry of information, <a href=\"http://www.sudaneseonline.com/keywords/rabbie-abd-al-attie\" title=\"\">Rabbie Abd al-Attie</a>, refused to comment. Spokespeople for the foreign ministry and the governing National Congress party were unavailable for comment. Sudan has <a href=\"http://www.sudantribune.com/Sudan-denies-using-force-against,43106\" title=\"\">categorically denied torturing detainees in the past</a>.</p> <p>Baghdady is now trying to spread awareness about the human rights situation in Sudan. Since his release, he has been working with activists including <a href=\"http://www.wagingpeace.info/\" title=\"\">Waging Peace,</a> which campaigns against human rights abuses, especially in Africa. One of Baghdady's aims is to get more protection for Sudanese asylum seekers in the UK.</p> <p>\"Working with Sudanese asylum seekers in the UK, we see evidence every day of the atrocities that the regime in Khartoum carries out against innocent people. This includes the use of detention, torture and murder as a weapon against those who oppose the government. This is not just limited to ethnic minorities in Darfur, where the regime has carried out a genocide, but extends to anyone they perceive as a threat,\" said Waging Peace's director, Olivia Warham.</p> <p>\"We have been overwhelmed by Magdy's bravery and determination to use his horrific experiences to highlight the practices that the Sudanese government are using and to demand justice for the innocent victims who have lost their liberty, and their lives, at the hands of this vicious government.\"</p> <p>Baghdady said that his ordeal was in no way comparable to the mistreatment of local prisoners. According to Waging Peace, which documents testimonies by torture survivors from Sudan, \"with few exceptions, most detainees are tortured in Sudanese prisons, including two teenagers whom Magdy witnessed being horrifically beaten for breakdancing on the street. Ten-year-olds were held in the cell next to him. Others were stripped, suspended from bars and flogged for hours. Some were sodomised and burned.\"</p> <p>The horrific experience in Sudan have given Baghdady new eyes to view the world. \"There are simple things in my life now that I enjoy more than ever, things like sitting in the tube, walking in the streets freely,\" he said. \"There are so many things in our lives that we just take for granted.\"</p>",

  "<h2>1) Size matters ...</h2> <p>It's obvious, sure, but it doesn't make it any less true. Being 6ft 5in tall allows Usain Bolt to take wider (and thus fewer) steps over a 100m race than his smaller rivals. On Sunday night he took 41 steps to win the Olympic final. Yohan Blake took 46 steps and Justin Gatlin took 42.5 steps.</p> <h2>2) ... but it's also about strength and elasticity too</h2> <p>What makes Bolt special is that he also possesses great strength and flexibility, which allows him to accelerate quickly and maintain a very high top speed. As Dr Ross Tucker of <a href=\"http://www.sportsscientists.com\" title=\"\">The Science of Sport website</a> explains: \"I've not seen such an elastic runner before. Bolt's advantages stem from a superior stretch-shortening cycle function, which allows energy to be stored and used more effectively. We know from research that power output is proportional to the amount of energy that can be stored and released from the muscle-tendon junction during the muscle contraction.\"</p> <h2>3) He was injury free</h2> <p>The news that Bolt had a \"slightly tight hamstring\" in the run-up to the Games led some to speculate whether the Jamaican would be at his best in London. But those close to his camp insist that he was able to put in six weeks of hard training beforehand. That ensured he was back to peak condition for the Games. And a fit Bolt is an almost unstoppable Bolt, providing he gets his start right.</p> <h2>4) He was more chilled than refrigerated Ting soda</h2> <p>Two scenes, six weeks apart, to compare and contrast. First, Bolt at the Jamaican trials: he had his business-face on, looked fretful before the start and failed to pass Blake, who started like a Lamborghini and finished like a tank. Second, Bolt entering the arena before the men's 100m final on Sunday night: he was smiling while everyone else was stony-faced, pogo-ing down the track in his warmup with the energy of a 70s punk, and then destroyed the rest of the field in the second fastest time in history.</p> <h2>5) Bolt's start</h2> <p>After the race, Bolt admitted that he was worried about a false start and so \"sat on the blocks a bit\" while he waited for the gun. His reaction time of 0.165sec, however, was actually faster than Blake (0.179sec) and Gatlin (0.178sec). As usual, Bolt was slower to build up to top speed than his nearest rivals, but his fast reaction time meant that although Gatlin was ahead of him early on, he was always within catching distance. Bolt could keep calm, and let his long legs do the rest.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/25/interpol-attempt-arrest-asian-separatist\" title=\"\">case of Benny Wenda</a>, leader of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/benny-wenda\" title=\"\">West Papuan independence movement</a>, is a perfect illustration of the need to reform Interpol and its abused red notice system. In 2002, Benny escaped from prison in Indonesia where he had been threatened, harassed and prosecuted on trumped-up charges. The UK, recognising persecution, granted him asylum. Benny, who now lives in Oxford with his wife and five children, went on to establish himself as the leader in exile of the West Papuan cause.</p> <p>Last year, Benny discovered that he was the subject of an Interpol red notice. The notice, issued at Indonesia's request, designated Benny as a wanted criminal and put him at risk of arrest throughout the world. Consequently, he could not risk travelling and had to decline invitations to speak about West Papua at international conferences. The notice also appeared on Interpol's website, complete with Benny's picture and allegations of violent crime, staining his reputation.</p> <p>Benny came to <a href=\"http://www.fairtrials.net\" title=\"\">Fair Trials International</a>, to ask what we could do to help. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/05/indonesia-catch-alleged-criminal-abuse-interpol\" title=\"\">Indonesia's angry response</a> to the Guardian's coverage showed it was not going to drop the red notice. The UK government was unwilling to demand that Interpol remove it; safely taking proceedings in Indonesia was unrealistic; and there was no court Benny could turn to. So we used the only avenue open to us and <a href=\"http://www.fairtrials.net/publications/article/benny-wenda-ccif-application\" title=\"\">wrote to</a> the <a href=\"http://www.interpol.int/About-INTERPOL/Structure-and-governance/Commission-for-the-Control-of-INTERPOL%27s-Files\" title=\"\">Commission for the Control of Interpol's Files</a>, arguing that Indonesia was abusing the red notice system for political purposes. We have just learned that the Commission agreed with our view. Interpol accepted the conclusion and removed the red notice.</p> <p>This result is welcome, but it begs the question: how was the world's largest policing organisation dragged into such a clearly political case, in breach of its cardinal rule of political neutrality? Some of Interpol's 190 member countries have appalling human rights records and are notoriously corrupt, yet it appears there is no effective system to stop these countries using Interpol's red notice system to persecute refugees and exiled political activists. Indeed, since last year's Guardian story, other victims of abusive red notices have approached us for help.</p> <p>Preventing misuse of Interpol is not only important for people such as Benny, it is also critical to Interpol's own credibility and effectiveness. Last month, the <a href=\"http://www.oscepa.org/\" title=\"\">Parliamentary Assembly of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> passed a resolution expressing concern about abuse of the Interpol red notice system by states whose judicial systems do not meet international standards. Opposing the motion was Russia, routinely condemned for its arbitrary criminal trials by the Council of Europe and declared a country of concern by the UK Foreign Office \u2013 and one of the biggest red notice users.</p> <p>To protect its own standing, Interpol must weed out suspicious red notices before they find their way on to police databases the world over. Flaws in its current systems would be less worrying if affected individuals had access to a fair, transparent process to raise their complaints. Unfortunately, the commission we applied to in Benny's case falls short: sitting only twice a year, it operates behind closed doors with no hearings and does not give reasoned decisions. Interpol usually follows its views, but can ask it to \"think again\" if it disagrees.</p> <p>Through dialogue with Interpol in recent months, we have learned a lot about how this important crime-fighting organisation works. Interpol states that it keeps its systems under regular review, and we are hopeful that, in light of cases such as Benny's, they will be persuaded to develop new safeguards to prevent countries using red notices to export persecution. Without these reforms, people like Benny, and Interpol's own reputation, will continue to suffer.</p>",
  "<p>Riyad Hijab, Syria's prime minister, has confirmed he has defected to join \"the revolution of freedom and dignity\" to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad \u2013 a propaganda coup for the opposition as the country's crisis escalates.</p> <p>Hijab is the most senior civilian politician to defect since the uprising against Assad began 17 months ago. Hijab arrived in neighbouring Jordan with two other so far unnamed ministers. \"I announce that I am from today a soldier in this blessed revolution,\" he said in a statement. Opposition supporters hailed the news but its long-term significance is hard to assess.</p> <p>Syria's prime minister is not a position of enormous importance: ministers are appointed by the president and are expected to do his bidding. Real power remains with Assad and the coterie of security chiefs and relatives who surround him.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/18/syria-rebels-kill-elite-damascus\" title=\"\">killing of four of Assad's top security chiefs</a> last month \u2013 including his brother-in-law Assef Shawkat \u2013 was a far more devastating blow. Hijab, who had a reputation as a loyal Ba'athist, was appointed in June after widely boycotted parliamentary elections.</p> <p>\"It's humiliating and shows that Assad doesn't know any more on whom he can count,\" said Rime Allaf, a Syrian analyst at London's Chatham House. An exiled opposition activist dismissed it as a \"PR blow, nothing more\".</p> <p>Still, his defection undermines the regime's ability to convey the impression that everything is under control as it battles \"armed terrorist gangs\" supported by a western-Arab conspiracy. It was telling that once rumours of Hijab's arrival in Jordan began to circulate, Syrian state media announced his \"resignation\" without offering further details. It is telling too that he is reported to have been accompanied by 10 members of his family, who would have faced retribution if they had remained in Syria.</p> <p>Hijab, a Sunni Muslim from Deir al-Zour, may have been influenced by rising anti-regime sentiment in his home area, near the border with Iraq. Nawwaf al-Fares, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/12/syrian-regime-must-be-ousted-nawaf-al-fares\" title=\"\">Syria's ambassador to Iraq and the most senior diplomat to defect</a>, is also from there. Like the defection of Manaf Tlass, a brigadier general in the elite Republican Guard, Hijab's move will trigger speculation about others who may follow and the effect on the regime.</p> <p>Hijab's spokesman said the defection had been co-ordinated with the Free Syrian Army, the main armed opposition group, over the two months since his appointment. That suggests there is truth to claims that the rebels have managed to cultivate significant figures within the regime whose departure may eventually help bring it down.</p> <p>\"The tightening of the regime circle even more closely around the Assads resembles the beginning of the end of the Gaddafi regime in Libya,\" said IHS Jane's Middle East analyst David Hartwell. \"Although the dynamics in Syria are very different, Damascus will face the same problem of trying to explain away the desertion of senior government officials at the same time as trying to claim that its rule remains unchanged. The perception that the Syrian regime is on its last legs has now never been stronger and it is likely that other senior political and military figures in the country are asking themselves how much longer they will either be party to or allow the fighting to continue.\"</p>",
  "<p>The performance of the morning has to go to Britain's Lawrence Okoye in the discus who, with one last throw, launched himself into an Olympic final in only his second proper year in the sport, having moved across from rugby last year.</p> <p>The 20-year-old threw 65.28m, the fourth best distance of the field, to set himself up for a chance to win a medal in Tuesday evening's final. The Croydon thrower, who deferred his place at Oxford to study law so that he could train for the Olympic Games, had left himself much to do after fouling his first throw and then coming up short by 40cm to secure qualification to the final with his second. As his third attempt flew over 65m, the Briton leapt around the track to celebrate.</p> <p>Tiffany Porter secured automatic qualification for the semi-finals of the 100m hurdles, finishing third in a fast heat with a time of 12.79 seconds. The 24-year-old said she was relieved to get through the round, in sharp contrast to her tears just four weeks ago after dropping out of her last competition in Crystal Palace with an aggravated back injury. \"The objective here was just to come out, execute and make the next round and I am very happy that I did that today,\" said the world indoor silver medallist. \"I've been very anxious and very nervous so I am just very happy that the first one is out of the way. I'm fine [injury-wise] and I'm very confident for the remainder of the competition.\"</p> <p>Andrew Osagie qualified for the semi-finals of the 800m, in what the 24-year-old jokingly termed, \"operation don't embarrass yourself on TV\". Having been drawn in a heat with the world champion and world record holder, David Rudisha. Osagie, who has a black belt in karate, did well to hold his nerve. \"It's always OK,\" he said of facing the Kenyan dubbed the Usain Bolt of middle distance running at such an early stage in the competition. \"It doesn't matter who you get drawn against in the heats, everyone's just as nervous as anyone else about going out in the heat.\"</p> <p>Osagie said the buoyant mood in the Team GB camp had helped his performance. \"It's been great. The kind of performances those guys put in over the weekend pre my race you know if you don't run well you'll be the laughing stock of the team. The whole team is feeling pretty positive at the moment, the story's going round about how the crowd is unbelievable and I witnessed it myself today.\"</p> <p>In the women's 1500m all three Britons qualified for the semi-finals. Hannah England, who just weeks ago was in hospital recovering from an infection in her achilles after being spiked by a competitor during a race in Hengelo, was thrilled to progress. \"Really, really pleased,\" said the world silver medallist. \"I felt like myself, I felt like I had presence in the race. I felt like that last year in Daegu, I felt like I belonged and it's nice to feel like that again after the time I had out.\" Lisa Dobriskey looked in commanding form as she began her bid to win an Olympic medal, having missed out by a whisker four years in Beijing, while Laura Weightman also got through her heat.</p> <p>But it was not all good news for Britain's athletes as discus throwers Brett Morse and Abdul Buhari as well as 800m runners Michael Rimmer and Gareth Warburton all went out in their first round of competition.</p>",

So why not make cycle proficiency a mandatory condition for getting a driving licence?</p> <p>Every driver should have firsthand experience of what it's like to ride a bike in the traffic. Any driver wanting to acquire an HGV licence has to get a normal driving licence first. And people wanting to take a car on the road should have the experience of cycling alongside cars and other vehicles. Drivers need to know how smaller vehicles and their more vulnerable users behave on the road, and the only real way to understand how cyclists act is to have a go at being one. Providing safety training to more cyclists on the streets is obviously desirable, but mandatory cycle training and licensing, often suggested by the more irate and vocal petrolhead crowd, would be a disaster and create a barrier to cycling take-up.</p> <p>An additional benefit would be that many more people would get a chance to see how convenient and safe cycling is. Many people are still too scared to travel by bike. In <a href=\"http://www.brake.org.uk/latest-news/commuters-call-for-safer-streets-for-cycling-to-enable-more-to-get-on-their-bikes.htm\" title=\"\">a recent survey</a>, 46% of those who took part said they would switch to cycling for short journeys if roads were safer. While there is plenty of practical work to be done in this area, changing people's perception of what is safe by increasing their confidence works wonders too. <a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/news/article/bike-training-success-for-london-borough-18822/\" title=\"\">In a 2008 study</a> of people who had received cycle training in Lambeth, half of those who cycled more after training said they felt more confident.</p> <p>There are also health and economic advantages. A <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12\" title=\"\">recent paper in the Lancet</a> concluded that replacing short journeys in cars and on public transport could save the NHS \u00a317bn over 20 years.</p> <p>The average cost of learning to drive is \u00a31363, according to <a href=\"http://www.uswitch.com/car-insurance/learn-to-drive/\" title=\"\">uSwitch</a>. The additional cost to the learner driver, thus, would not be significant. For example, a complete cycle training course for a resident of Hounslow would cost \u00a382.50, giving the learner four hours on-road experience. For someone with the most basic cycling ability who could skip the first session, the cost drops to \u00a355. Hounslow's provider, <a href=\"http://www.cycleexperience.com/adult-training-applicant-book3.php?adulttrainingvenueid=18\" title=\"\">CycleExperience</a>, makes a small charge for bike rental, while other outfits will loan a bike for free.</p> <p>Many local councils offer free or highly subsidised bike training, and while the demand might put pressure on these services the fact remains that cycle proficiency lessons are very economical and would not significantly increase the cost of learning to drive. In fact, cycling could save them money \u2013 60% of adults who participated in the Lambeth study cycle more after having received the training, saving money on petrol and public transport.</p> <p>Evidence suggests that having more cyclists on the road <a href=\"http://www.ctc.org.uk/resources/Campaigns/CTC_Safety_in_Numbers.pdf\" title=\"\">decreases the proportion who are involved in accidents</a>, so more people taking up cycling makes it safer. Introducing a measure which is guaranteed both to get more people on bikes and make sure drivers understand cycling is a no-brainer. It would be relatively cheap, have a big impact and would improve cyclist safety without infrastructure investment.</p>",
  "<p>Even the most sports-phobic dance fan is likely to have been watching the gymnastics during London 2012. The aerial choreography, the gravity-defying pirouettes and balances are as close to dance as any event in the Olympics. Some of the world's most famous dancers, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvie_Guillem\" title=\"\">Sylvie Guillem</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/mar/06/sergei-polunin-give-up-ballet\" title=\"\">Sergei Polunin</a> included, started out as gymnastic prodigies; many of today's Olympians have trained with ballet masters and mistresses in order to hone their elegance of phrasing and line.

Komova is impressive to watch. Yet as someone with only a superficial knowledge of the sport, I was relieved to read commentary on the internet confirming my sense that the levels of technical ability required of today's gymnasts, astounding though they are, come at the expense of fluency of phrasing, and grace.</p> <p>Back in 1972 it was apparently a different world. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x57vNFoxZtY\" title=\"\">Olga Korbut is exceptional</a>, of course, but <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJXXGyVly_g\" title=\"\">the way she dances through her entire routine in this clip</a> makes it expressive as well as awesome. In the opening seconds, the line of her arabesque beautifully prefigures the flared arch of the leap that follows: the control with which she comes out of her first diagonal of airborne somersaults allows her to channel the impetus of her movement up through her torso and down into the delicate detailing of her hands (0.17). The sequence of chasses and jetes into which Korbut then moves may not be technically extreme, but the height and spring of her jump sustain the physical intensity as well as the flow of the choreography and I love the way that she uses her head at 0.26, tilting it back to create a moment of lift and suspension before she moves down on to the floor.</p> <p>Korbut's sense of her own body line and shape and her relationship to the space around her is also supremely assured \u2013 the way she suspends that backward flip, hanging for a perfect nano-second in the air.</p> <p>By contrast, Komova is required to cram so many \"difficulty\" scoring moves into her routine that she lacks the time and space to let her body sing.</p> <p>I may be completely wrong here but the toughness of today's routines also seems to have upped the quotient of distracting head tossing and prancing that goes on in the corners of the mat. Presumably these \"asides\" are essential for the competitors to catch their breath and rev their energy up for the next big sequence.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_Hoz61c0bjw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_Hoz61c0bjw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Gabby Douglas won hearts and points by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hoz61c0bjw\" title=\"\">making a perky cheerleading virtue of them</a>.

  "<p>According to Hitchcock, his filmography contained only a few \"Hitchcock films\". Rear Window was a Hitchcock film, Psycho was a Hitchcock film, The Lodger was the first Hitchcock film. Dial M for Murder should have made the cut.</p> <p>It's a film based on a hit play by a writer, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/jan/16/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\" title=\"Frederick Knott's obituary\">Frederick Knott</a>, who hated writing and made by a director who said his batteries were running dry. When discussing the film (officially his 45th) in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/film/9780671604295/hitchcock-a-definitive-study-of-alfred-hitchcock\" title=\"Francois Traffauts A Definitive Study of Alfred Hitchcock\">Francois Truffaut's A Definitive Study of Alfred Hitchcock</a> \u2013 a book-length transcription of 50 hours of conversation between the directors \u2013 Hitchcock said the picture was an example of him \"coasting, playing it safe\". In the book they're done with the film within three pages: \"There isn't very much we can say about that one, is there?\"</p> <p>I disagree. Dial M for Murder has a romping plot, a gloriously slimy villain and \u2013 thanks to the fact that (as in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/78847/rope\" title=\"Rope at guardian.co.uk\">Rope</a> before and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/78847/rope\" title=\"Rear Window at guardian.co.uk\">Rear Window</a> after) the action is mostly constrained to one room \u2013 some of the weirdest, tricksiest camera work of Hitchcock's career.</p> <p>The plot follows Tony Wendice's plan to have his wife, Margot, murdered so he can collect on her life insurance policy. A former tennis pro whose tour earnings are dwindling, he's also discovered that Margot is having an affair with a famous crime writer called Mark Halliday, who is visiting the couple from America. Wendice has blackmailed an old schoolmate to do the deed and plans to use a boys' night out with Halliday as his alibi. But when the murder's bungled and Margot kills the killer, he's left having to improvise.</p> <p>Wendice (played with a snake-like charm by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Milland\" title=\"Ray Milland on wikipedia\">Ray Milland</a>) is a classic Hitchcock villain: the stylish epitome of upper class evil. There's something wonderfully, obviously false about him, especially in the scenes just before he and Halliday head out for the night. It's the last time that Wendice believes he'll see his wife alive and, as he leaves the flat, he turns back to her, pats her on the cheek and says \"Goodbye, dear\". The pat on the cheek is contemptuous, the \"Goodbye\" horribly final. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Kelly\" title=\"Grace Kelly on wikipedia\">Grace Kelly</a>, acting for Hitchcock for the first time, doesn't have a lot to do as Margot in the film, but here she gives a haunting reaction, full of hurt and confusion, with a touch of recognition too.</p> <p>Hitchcock refused to, as Truffaut says, \"ventilate the play\" \u2013 to extend the scope of the story much beyond what Knott had already supplied for the theatre. We rarely leave the Wendice's flat, so Hitch forces himself to play in the space. There's a great moment where the camera points down over Wendice as he explains his plan, making the room look like a crime scene, even before any foul play has taken place (later, when the murder has been foiled and the police arrive, the same shot is used to study the forensic team at work). Similarly canny is the quick pan following the bundle of money that Wendice throws to the murderer and the slow tracking shot that follows him around the room as he describes discovering Margot's affair.</p> <p>Finally, there's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBoL2vMJkCs\">the attempted murder</a> \u2013 as frightening for me as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/34630/psycho\" title=\"Psycho at guardian.co.uk\">Psycho</a>'s shower scene. The two note \"tick-tock\" refrain of the soundtrack as Wendice realises his watch has stopped; the jump cut to the telephone exchange; the painfully \u2013 almost comically \u2013 long time it takes Margot to hang up the phone before the murderer strikes; Grace Kelly's neck bulging over the tourniquet as he strangles her; her scrabbling for a weapon and then the scissors stabbing into his back and getting knocked deeper in when he falls to the ground. The close-up as they hit home. Nasty stuff.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LBoL2vMJkCs?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LBoL2vMJkCs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LBoL2vMJkCs\">Reading on mobile? Watch here</a></p> <p>I'm not sure why Hitchcock never really owned Dial M for Murder. Perhaps it was because he owed Warner Brothers a film and just wanted it out of the way before his move to Paramount. Perhaps the tacky novelty of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6N5gXr784Y\">shooting in 3D </a>irritated him (although by all accounts he did an artisan's job of that too, even if most cinemas chose to run the standard version). Maybe he was bored by a story that, bar the attempted murder, relies little on surprise or suspense to entertain the audience: it's less whodunit, more hedunit and will he get away with it?</p> <p>Whatever the reason, it's a shame Hitch chose to dismiss Dial M. It's a taut, acidly funny thriller. Rear Window would come next, an undisputed classic made by a master whose batteries were fully charged. This is how good he was when running on empty.</p>",

The period referred to the anxious moments during which the spacecraft punched into the Martian atmosphere at 13,000mph, performed a series of exquisite manoeuvres, and came to a standstill on the ground, all without human intervention.</p> <p>In the event, the entry was swift and went without a glitch. In the final stage of landing, the spacecraft fired up eight retrorockets to slow its descent, before its \"sky crane\" lowered the 900kg (1,984lb), car-sized Curiosity rover to the ground on nylon ropes. The conditions on Mars, where the wind can gust to 90mph, were calm, and the rover touched down at 1.5mph, more softly than expected. Seconds later, the rover beamed its first images back to Earth, the pictures taking nearly 14 minutes at the speed of light to reach mission control at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California.</p> <p>\"It's absolutely incredible.

I want you to look around tonight at all those folks in the blue shirts and think about what we've achieved. I think it's fair to say Nasa knows how to explore, we've been exploring, and we're on Mars.\"</p> <p>Curiosity is the largest and most sophisticated rover Nasa has ever sent to another planet. Over the next 98 weeks \u2013 or one Martian year \u2013 the six-wheeled vehicle will trundle around the ancient Gale crater and scale its central mound, the three mile-high Mount Sharp, examining rocks and soil for evidence that the planet was once hospitable to life. Aboard the rover are 10 scientific instruments that will scour the Martian surface for rocks that formed in the presence of water, and other geological clues that the planet was once habitable.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/physics/research/src/res/planetary-science/images/JCB-2010-b.jpg/view\" title=\"U Leicester; John Bridges\">John Bridges</a>, a planetary scientist at Leicester University, who was at JPL for the landing, told the Guardian: \"From cruise stage separation, atmospheric entry at 6km per second, parachute deployment, slowing down, then sky crane deployment, it went without a hitch.

It will climb up the shallow sides of the mountain, following a path drawn up from maps created using images taken by Mars orbiters.</p> <p>Scientists hope the mountain will be a window into the planet's past. At the bottom of the crater are rocks thought to be more than 3.5bn years old, but higher up, the deposits are ever younger. As the rover climbs, the measurements it makes will reconstruct the planet's habitat from the ancient past until now.</p> <p>Curiosity has a robotic arm, with a scoop and drill, which can collect samples for analysis on board the rover. On a central mast, the rover holds a camera and laser that can vaporise rock surfaces and study their makeup from nearly 10 metres (33ft) away.</p> <p>The Nasa team will now take 10 Martian days \u2013 each one being 24 hours and 40 minutes \u2013 to run checks on the rover and ensure it is healthy before exploration begins in earnest.

  "<p>Senior civil servants are furious at the accusation by Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude that they have been engaged in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/05/ministers-formal-role-civil-service-appraisals?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">\"passive resistance\"</a> to government policy.</p> <p>At a <a href=\"http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=11276\" title=\"\">July hearing</a> of the Lords committee into the accountability of civil servants, Maude said coalition ministers were \"enraged\" by the way some civil servants declined to challenge government policy, but then refused to implement it. It was, he said, a practice that was too widespread and a \"sin against the holy ghost\".</p> <p>Whitehall officials have expressed disturbance at Maude's suggestion that civil servants are not being neutral in the way they implement policy, and have said that civil service independence is \"very important\" and any attempt to politicise the civil service, through ministers having a greater say in their appointment, would be a mistake. \"A politicised civil service will be less efficient,\" said one commentator on Twitter.</p> <p>Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, said: \"With the coalition government in mid-term doldrums, it is not surprising that there is a degree of tension around government. That said, it is important that civil servants are able and willing to challenge ministers during policy debate, but once decisions are taken implement them with pace, passion and professionalism.\"</p> <p>Maude's comments reflect growing tension at the heart of the government over the implementation of the civil service reform plan.

  "<p>Clever, confident and articulate, Louise Mensch seemed like someone who could look forward to promotion and a potentially glittering cabinet future. Yet here she is surprising Westminster by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/aug/06/louise-mensch-resigns-mp\" title=\"\">announcing she is stepping down </a>from politics for family reasons.</p> <p>There may be a yet-to-emerge backstory to all this \u2013 an Olympic August is not the best month for village gossip in London SW1. Mensch, formerly Louise Bagshawe, the successful chick-lit author, has a sufficiently <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Mensch\" title=\"\">interesting CV</a> and enough enemies to make her vulnerable to all sorts of pressures. A lot of Tory MPs hate her guts, by the way.</p> <p>I passed Mensch in a Commons corridor the other day, hunched with her eyes to the ground. \"You look tense,\" I thought. Now we know, she had a lot on her mind.</p> <p>But my hunch is no, it's as she states in her resignation letter to David Cameron. She's 41, she has three children from her first marriage and last summer she married a rock band manager who works in New York. That's a tall order to juggle and her letter thanks Cameron \u2013 on whose controversial A-list of candidates she appeared in 2006 \u2013 for giving her an extra day a week in her Corby and East Northamptonshire constituency to cope with it all.</p> <p>It's a former steel town full of expat Scots which is recovering from the loss of heavy industry with lighter industry and encouraging prospects. The constituency is surrounded with pretty villages. It's part urban, part rural. Alas, Mensch cannot drive. Was she parachuted into the wrong sort of seat? We'll come back to that.</p> <p>Two obvious points are worth making here, three if we count the awkward byelection in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corby_(UK_Parliament_constituency)\" title=\"\">marginal East Midlands seat</a>, which would go back to Labour \u2013 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Hope\" title=\"\">Phil Hope</a> held it from 1997-2010, Tory Bill Powell for 14 years before that \u2013 on a very modest swing of 1.9%. Lucky Ed Miliband. How Dave must be cursing his own run of bad luck. All those gold medals lost by his mere presence \u2013 and now this. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndySawford?tw_i=232391451240189952&amp;tw_e=screenname&amp;tw_p=tweetembed\" title=\"\">Andy Sawford</a>, Labour's candidate-in-waiting, is already on the case.</p> <p>The first point is that Mensch had a lot going for her. A privileged upper-middle-class Catholic background, buttressed by the Brideshead Revisited world of Christ Church, Oxford, a successful career of her own as a writer and a willingness to take political risks \u2013 harrying Rupert and James Murdoch at the culture committee hearings was likely to draw retaliation \u2026 It all suggested she might be serious about politics, a woman with the guts, brains and (dare I add?) looks to go far.</p> <p>In the phone-hacking battle she took on fellow committee members Tom Watson and Paul Farrelly too, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/jul/29/louise-mensch-apologises-piers-morgan\" title=\"\">as well as Piers Morgan</a>, who (for once) got the better of an MP on a point of phone-hacking fact. As a combative high-profile MP she was targeted by NHS campaigners for supporting Andrew Lansley's health bill.</p> <p>In Cameron's letter \u2013 also published on Monday \u2013 he calls her a \"truly inspiring MP\" who brought politics alive for people, not least through her \"effective\" use of TV and social media. Smart woman that she is, she even <a href=\"http://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/news/local/exclusive-louise-mensch-resigns-as-corby-and-east-northamptonshire-mp-1-4132714\" title=\"\">made sure her local constituency paper got a beat</a> on the resignation, a courtesy which not all self-important MPs would remember: your local paper is the most important paper.</p> <p>One of my Labour chums has just told me she is \"a big loss, a big character who had reached a point which many politicians can only dream about. It says a lot about wider Westminster culture.\" A Tory MP friend is more brutal. \"She's completely loopy and always has been. She's only interested in her own publicity, an A-list candidate in the wrong seat who couldn't drive and wasn't available at the weekends because of her family.\"</p> <p>They're both right, but I suspect my Tory source is more correct when he explains the retiring MP's high profile in terms of being a \"London metropolitan phenomenon\", someone the media will be more enthusiastic about than many constituents. Everyone understands family pressures, three kids are a handful, but she had them before she got elected and got elected before she married a bloke in New York.</p> <p>Westminster is not the hard-hearted, bloke-ish place it used to be (so they tell me), in terms of attitudes and working hours. Myself, I still take the view that anyone old enough to vote should nowadays be expected to hold a driving licence and own a mobile phone which is normally switched on. Mensch scored only 50% on that test.</p> <p>That brings me to my second point, that Cameron-bashers in the Conservative ranks are already reaching for a familiar complaint, that Mensch is just the type of London posh girl who got on to the A-list as part of Dave's makeover in 2006 when she wasn't really cut out for the rough and humdrum tumble of being an MP in a highly marginal seat; she hadn't really thought it through.</p> <p>In the old days an aspiring candidate usually had to fight an unwinnable seat before getting a crack at a good one. The urgent necessity to make the Cameroons look less white and male led the leadership to skip that bit. It was a good policy, but the pressures on a modern MP \u2013 social media is a two-way weapon \u2013 are considerable and voters are less grateful for hard work than they are towards Olympic medal winners.</p> <p>Mensch is one of the casualties. If we get a \"Labour Sweeps Home in Corby!\" headline on 15 November \u2013 the likely election date, which coincides with the ballot to elect police commissioners \u2013 it will also be a further tin tack in the cardboard coffin they are building for Dave at the Carlton Club.</p>",
  "<p><strong>What's so funny? </strong><br>Billy the Mime is the silent, white-faced alter ego of American actor and comedian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Banks\" title=\"\">Steven Banks</a>. If you know him at all, it'll be from Penn Jillette and Paul Provenza's smutty documentary <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2005/sep/02/3\" title=\"\">The Aristocrats</a>, but he's also a mainstay of the New York theatre and comedy scene.</p> <p><strong>Mime? White-faced? Since when was that back in fashion?</strong> <br>It isn't. \"Politically incorrect, shockingly unsentimental and ... sardonically twisted,\" <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/19/theater/19frin.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\" title=\"\">said the New York Times</a>, no less.</p> <p><strong>Examples, please.</strong> <br>Billy introduces his scenes with captions including A Day Called 9/11, Whitney Houston's Last Bath and The Priest and the Altar Boy. His silent sketches include scenes of him shooting up, and another of him being buggered in a toilet cubicle.</p> <p><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7009040.stm\" title=\"\"><strong>Marcel Marceau</strong></a><strong>, it ain't? </strong><br>Well, no \u2013 and partly because Billy's mime skills aren't as good: it's not always clear what he's doing. But he is Marceau-like, in that his skits aren't as subversive as they're cracked up to be. The content is risqu\u00e9, but the form is very trad: exaggerated facial expressions, a certain feyness to the movement, and some horrible canned music. The attitudes struck can be conventional, too: Billy's dumb-show of Charles and Di's relationship casts Diana as the blameless victim; his Navy Seal versus Osama bin Laden skit is straightforward triumphalism.</p> <p><strong>This sounds like an odd show.</strong> <br>It is quite unlike anything else.</p> <p><strong>But is it amusing?</strong> <br>Sometimes. And sometimes \u2013 at its best moments, in fact \u2013 it's heartfelt. Billy's Whitney Houston scene isn't a mickey-take, it's a tribute, to a woman recapturing her youthful glories at the moment of her death. His scene about paedophile priests, meanwhile, is quietly chilling.</p> <p><strong>File under \u2026</strong><br>Curio. It's a show to see if you want something a bit different, not if you want laugh-out-loud funny. Or, for that matter, shocking.</p> <p>\u2022 Just the Tonic at The Caves (0131 556 5375).

  "<p>It's the soundtrack to Tel Aviv beach life: an incessant thwack-thwack-thwack heard over the rhythmic rush of waves and the tinny beat of a thousand iPods.</p> <p>Matkot \u2013 known to most of the rest of the world as bat-and-ball \u2013 is Israel's unofficial national sport. If it was played at the Olympics, Israel ought to be gold medallists. Athletes would well up in their speedos and thongs as the blue and white flag was raised and the Israeli national anthem, Hatikva, echoed across the Olympic Stadium.</p> <p>But it's hard to envisage a game that has no rules, score, winners or losers finding a place in the world's supreme sports competition. And, in any case, some of those on the water's edge, as a vivid orange sun sank towards the Mediterranean one evening last week, felt proprietorial.</p> <p>\"The second that matkot became an Olympic game, other countries would take it seriously,\" said Gal Agar, 22. \"The Chinese would move in, then we'd be pushed out. We're only good as long as we're amateurs.\"</p> <p>It's somewhat unexpected to find Israel among the also-rans on the world stage. For a small, new country \u2013 roughly the size of Wales, with a population of less than eight million, and only 64 years old \u2013 Israel usually punches above its weight in the international arena. Not at the Olympics, where only one of Israel's 37 athletes \u2013 the windsurfer Lee Korzits \u2013 stands a chance of winning a medal.</p> <p>In Mike's Place, a beachfront sports bar at which three Israelis were killed in a bombing carried out by a pair of British Muslims in 2003, Jacob Fiddler was phlegmatic. \"Everyone around here has their own team,\" he said, referring to a largely anglophone clientele. \"When it comes to sport, the US is my country,\" said the 25-year-old barman who emigrated to Israel from Chicago six years ago.</p> <p>In a nation of first, second or third generation immigrants, it's not so hard for sports fans to revert to their \"home\" country. Another option is to support Jewish athletes from other nations. Israel's media celebrated the success of Aly Raisman, an American Jewish floor gymnast who executed her floor routine to the Hebrew folk tune Hava Nagila last week, as one of their own.</p> <p>But the question of why Israel fails to make a mark at the Olympics remains. \"We are very far from being a superpower in sports,\" said one Israeli government official. \"We rejoice in the odd swimmer that makes it into the final, the poor man's triumph. It's not that we can't compete with the greatest nations \u2013 we are struggling even against the modest ones.\"</p> <p>Even relatively recent waves of immigration to Israel from Russia and Ethiopia had failed to produced world-class athletes, he said. \"Our people are forced to choose their heroes among the athletes of other nations.\"</p> <p>Some attribute this shortcoming to a lack of investment in sport and hothouse training of potential champions. \"We have other needs and priorities\", said Jeremy, 33, who emigrated to Israel from the US more than 20 years ago. \"And we don't have a lot of people to choose from. The Olympics is an uphill struggle for us.\"</p> <p>Another theory was that the socialist-Zionist ideal, embodied in the kibbutz movement, lessens a competitive spirit. That simply doesn't wash with anyone who has experienced Israeli motorists or supermarket check-out queues.</p> <p>For Uri Avnery, the veteran Israeli commentator and activist, the Olympics \u2013 and especially the opening ceremony \u2013 was a sobering experience for his compatriots.</p> <p>\"We tend to see ourselves as the centre of the world, a power well beyond our modest size. Yet here our delegation was marching, one among many, one of the smaller ones, without the glamour some of the others possess, without a single champion that all mankind recognises. A good reason for modesty \u2013 a virtue we cannot usually boast of,\" he wrote.</p> <p>There are other, non-sporting, issues on which Israel has focused attention: the refusal of the International Olympic Committee to hold a minute's silence for the 11 Israeli athletes killed at Munich in 1972; the security provided to its participants in London this year; the row over the BBC's description of Jerusalem as the \"seat of government\" (almost the entire international community does not recognise Jerusalem as the Israeli capital).</p> <p>But such matters were not much occupying those in Mike's Place, nor in Torsina's coffee and nargila bar in Jaffa, an historic Arab neighbourhood next to Tel Aviv.</p> <p>Mahmoud, sucking on a shisha pipe in front of a large television screen showing live coverage of the Olympics, said he was looking forward to the resumption of nightly football matches. In the meantime, he was supporting Israel, albeit without much hope. \"Most people round here don't support Israel. You know why \u2013 it's about Arabs and Jews. Yes I'm an Arab, but I live in Israel. The Palestinian athletes are even worse. What can I do?\"</p>",

The forces will impose full control over these areas of Sinai.\"</p> <p>The president convened an emergency meeting with military and security leaders in the aftermath of the assault, which he described as a \"serious challenge to the Egyptian sovereignty\".</p> <p>Following the attack, which was launched just after sunset on Sunday, the Israeli defence minister, Ehud Barak, said it had \"again raise[d] the need for determined Egyptian action to enforce security and prevent terror in the Sinai\".</p> <p>He said Israel had contacted the Egyptian authorities to offer help. \"We hope this will be a fitting wake-up call for the Egyptians to take things in hand on their side more forcefully,\" he told the Israeli parliament's foreign affairs and defence committee on Monday.</p> <p>Israel has become increasingly concerned about a security vacuum in the Sinai in the 18 months since Hosni Mubarak, the former president and staunch ally of Israel, was deposed in the Egyptian revolution.</p> <p>There have been a number of attacks and attempted attacks on Israel from across the border.</p> <p>Israel says some militant groups in Gaza have joined forces with Islamists operating in the Sinai.

According to a spokesman for the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF), eight armed men launched an attack, killing around 15 men and injuring another seven.</p> <p>The militants commandeered two armoured vehicles, which they drove towards the Israeli border. One vehicle exploded on the Egyptian side of the border, and the other broke through the security fence near the Kerem Shalom border crossing and was targeted by Israeli air force planes.</p> <p>The Israeli government spokesman Ofir Gendelman said seven militants had been killed, four on the Israeli side and three in Egypt.</p> <p>The Israeli military instructed Israeli civilians to stay inside their homes while combing the area for other militants who might still be on the Israeli side of the border.</p> <p>Officials say Egypt has deployed at least two helicopter gunships to the Sinai in the hunt for the militants behind the checkpoint attack.</p> <p>Security and military officials said on Monday that more aircraft were expected to arrive in the town of El-Arish before a military campaign against the militants in the area.</p> <p>Egypt and Israel blamed the attack on Islamist militants from both Gaza and the Sinai.</p> <p>Hamas, the Islamist organisation which rules Gaza, issued a statement condemning the attack. It has made efforts to contain militant activity since the end of its war with Israel three and a half years ago.</p> <p>\"Hamas condemns this ugly crime which killed a number of Egyptian soldiers and extends its deep condolences to the families of the victims and to the leadership and the people of Egypt,\" it said.</p> <p>Islamic Jihad and the Popular Resistance Committee, both of which have frequently launched rockets into southern Israel, also condemned the attack.</p> <p>Israeli intelligence services said they had information about an impending infiltration and sent aircraft to strike at the second car the militants had seized from the Egyptian forces. \"We were prepared for it, so there was a hit,\" said the Israeli military spokesman Brig-Gen Yoav Mordechai. The military \"averted a major attack on southern Israel\", he said.</p> <p>The Egyptian authorities closed the Rafah crossing to Gaza following the attack.</p> <p>Earlier on Sunday, a militant in Gaza was killed and another injured in an Israeli air strike on a motorcycle travelling near the Egyptian border. The IDF said in a statement that it had targeted a \"global jihad-affiliated terrorist squad in the southern Gaza Strip\" which was responsible for an attack on the Israel-Egypt border in June in which an Israeli civilian was killed. Another attack was being planned, the IDF said.</p> <p>However, the two incidents were not connected, according to an IDF spokesman.</p>",
  "<p>After four and a half years and more than 200 columns Behind the Music is coming to an end. It's been an interesting journey and many of the issues I grappled with still remain unsolved.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2008/jan/16/behindthemusicsongwritersd\">first ever Behind the Music</a> asked why songwriters couldn't get their act together and strike for better terms for online usage of music. Four and a half years later, they're no closer to doing so \u2013 despite streaming rates being so low that one songwriter told me she recently got a royalty check for \u00a326 for 2m plays on Pandora and \u00a32.75 for 330,000 plays on YouTube.</p> <p>Yet there have been leaps forward for musicians and their fans. For one, there are now more ways than ever for them to connect. Direct-to-fan services such as PledgeMusic, which <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2009/dec/10/future-fan-funding\">we featured back in 2009</a>, and Kickstarter are giving fans the chance to support established and emerging artists.</p> <p>It's now easier and more convenient to access music legally, at your fingertips, than ever before. In 2008 there were no unlimited free streaming services where one could arrange tracks into playlists and share with friends. MySpace was still the go-to place to discover new music. Facebook had a 10th of the users it has today, and Amazon had just started selling MP3 downloads, and was far from making a dent on iTunes' hold on the market.</p> <p>I've reported on music services in their infancy. Some have expanded and become successful (notably <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2009/aug/17/major-labels-spotify\">Spotify</a>) \u2013 others not so much (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2010/apr/12/behind-music-go-mflow\">mFlow</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2010/nov/01/tunited-midge-ure-ultravox-downloads\">Midge Ure's Tunited</a>). Back in 2009 I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2009/dec/17/unlimited-downloading-file-sharing\">argued the case</a> for launching an unlimited ISP-based downloading and streaming service. We're still no closer to that dream coming true. To quote The Newsroom: progress is slow but I'm in it for the long haul.</p> <p>The idea of Behind the Music was to give readers insight into the industry \u2013 the issues music-makers grapple with, from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2008/feb/29/behindthemusicthedaythemusicdied\">writer's block</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2010/oct/07/behind-music-secret-writing-hit\">secret to writing a hit song</a> (hint: there is no recipe) to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2008/aug/28/whenrecorddealsgowrongand\">getting out of record contracts</a> \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2009/sep/10/behind-music-survive-dropped\">survive being dropped</a>.</p> <p>Yes, piracy has featured on a regular basis \u2013 it's impossible to ignore something that's played a part in halving revenue from record sales (and in turn the income of songwriters and artists) within a decade. I've <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2009/apr/02/pirate-bay-music-piracy\">covered the Pirate Bay</a> for years, while trials have come and gone, and those behind the site have been convicted. Yet it's still up and running, along with hundreds of other online businesses making millions from unlicensed copyrighted material. The Digital Economy Act was passed <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/04/09/dea_timetable/\">more than two years ago</a>, yet it's still far from being implemented, as letters to suspected copyright infringers aren't expected to be <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/04/24/digital_economy_act_warnings/\">sent out until 2014</a>.</p> <p>I've always been a proponent of targeting the businesses peddling in illegal copyrighted material rather than music fans, and recently there have been positive signs of payment services, such as PayPal voluntarily refusing to work with such businesses.</p> <p>Many of you who disagreed with me were also the most faithful in commenting \u2013 an illustration of the Howard Stern effect (those who like him listen for an hour a day while those who don't listen for two) \u2013 and I will miss the heated debates on the threads.</p> <p>So what does the future hold for those working in music? It looks like we'll end up with just three major labels \u2013 one of them being more like a super major, if the Universal/EMI merger is approved in the US and Europe. No doubt Universal will then be able to dictate the kind of music services we'll see to an ever greater degree, as well as which artists get the biggest marketing push and how much musicians will be able to earn from such services.<br> Talent will always prevail and once in a while we'll see exceptional artists break through \u2013 Frank Ocean being one of them \u2013 because music that reaches into your heart and makes you see the world in a different light cannot be contained.</p> <p>The end of Behind the Music does not spell the end of my writing for the Guardian, and you can <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helienne\">follow me on Twitter</a> to find out where I land next.</p>",

CHUCK NORRIS is #STAMPED . lol\" with a link to his account on Stamped led to a surge in downloads for the app, sending it into the Top 100 Free Apps chart on the App Store, and the Top 10 in the social networking category \u2013&#xa0;both in the US.</p> <p>The effect was short-lived. At the time of writing, Stamped has fallen out of the Top 200 Free Apps chart, and has slipped to 28th in the social networking chart. </p> <p>AppData, which only measures the number of users who connected the Stamped app to their Facebook account, <a href=\"http://appdata.com/apps/facebook/297022226980395-stamped\">suggests the app jumped</a> from 6,812 monthly active users (MAUs) on 3 August \u2013 the day of the tweet \u2013&#xa0;to 7,866 two days later.</p> <p>Not such a big leap given Bieber's 26.2m Twitter followers, really.</p> <p>The Bieber Effect was more in evidence for video-sharing app Viddy, which Bieber adopted in May 2012 \u2013&#xa0;posting a <a href=\"http://viddy.com/play/video/61bdc576-4cd9-40ac-90a2-8800f8864395?source=Profile\">video of himself shirtless</a> at a photo shoot and tweeting the link to his followers. Unsurprisingly, it was quite popular.</p> <p>Bieber has since <a href=\"http://viddy.com/JustinBieber\">attracted 239k unique followers</a> on Viddy, which grew fast to a peak of more than 16m MAUs in July, although it has <a href=\"http://appdata.com/apps/facebook/125119214225766-viddy\">since been sinking again</a> to its current 8.4m MAUs. More on that later.</p> <p>What Viddy and Stamped share isn't just Justin Bieber as a user, but Justin Bieber as an investor. Forbes <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2012/05/16/justin-bieber-venture-capitalist-the-forbes-cover-story/3/\">reported in May</a> that Bieber had already invested in Stamped, with Viddy to come. It also cited Spotify, Tinychat and Sojo Studios as previous investments.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"In a typical Bieber deal he'll put in about $250,000 at the favorable pricing generally reserved for smart money\u2014the kind of strategic partners that help a company long term. Braun won't disclose the size of Bieber's portfolio but says it's between 2% and 5% of the singer's net worth. FORBES puts Bieber's fortune at about $80 million, which translates to somewhere in the ballpark of $3 million in venture investments.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Bieber certainly isn't the only example of this. His girlfriend, Selena Gomez, <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2011/11/17/selena-gomez-investment-postcard-on-the-run/\">invested in social app Postcard on the Run</a> in November 2011, and Shakira <a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/23/viddy-a-video-sharing-app-attracts-biz-stone-and-shakira-as-investors/\">chipped in</a> to Viddy's last round of funding too. Outside apps, Lady Gaga and her manager Troy Carter <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/20/first-look-backplane-the-lady-gaga-backed-community-platform-with-all-star-investors-invites/\">invested in social media startup Backplane</a>, and used its platform to build her Little Monsters fan community.</p> <p>The appeal of pop-star investors is clear for startups: they have money, and they have fanbases and social media profiles big enough \u2013&#xa0;<em>in theory</em> \u2013&#xa0;to help apps cut through the ferocious competition on the app stores.</p> <p>Savvy managers like Carter and Braun are at the forefront of a growing realisation among top-tier musicians that $250k spent on a promising startup rather than a video / second mansion / inflatable Eiffel Tower for the live show may be money well spent if its ultimate exit is lucrative.</p> <p>The money aspect is persuasive, but the theory that pop stars can turn an app into a hit through social media alone is less convincing \u2013&#xa0;check those Stamped figures from the last weekend, or Viddy's ongoing slide.</p> <p>Entrepreneur and investor Chris Dixon has just published an <a href=\"http://cdixon.org/2012/08/03/ten-million-is-the-new-one-million/\">insightful blog post</a> on why \"Ten million users is the new one million users\", giving this advice:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"For consumer startups with non-transactional models (ad-based or unknown business models), you need something closer to 10 million users versus 1 million users to get Series A funded.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>For all Justin Bieber's social media clout, he's unlikely to send a startup like Stamped soaring through the 1m users mark, let alone 10m. But hard dollars from he and his fellow stars may at least provide the cushion for startups to develop the features that will make their apps good enough to aim for those targets through organic, word-of-mouth growth.</p>",
  "<p>Setting ambitious and public diversity targets shows that an organisation is seriously committed to gender diversity and equality; that it has senior buy-in and leadership on this issue; and that it is constantly striving to improve, rather than accept the status quo.</p> <p>But simply setting targets is not enough. Despite women making up nearly 50% of the labour market, there are still fewer and fewer women at the higher levels of most organisations and in some cases, including central government watchdog the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/jul/31/senior-female-managers-fallen-nao?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">National Audit Office</a>, progress seems to have slowed.</p> <p>There are many complex causes for this leaking pipeline.But given that the compelling<a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-07-31/women-as-directors-beat-men-only-boards-in-company-stock-return\" title=\"\"> business rationale</a> for organisations to create workplaces which allow everyone to succeed and thrive no matter their gender, what should public leaders do to improve their diversity at senior levels?</p> <p>Here are six steps a senior leader can draw upon to accelerate this pace of change.</p> <p>1. Set out the goalposts</p> <p>An important first step is to unpick the workforce metrics. What are the numbers telling you? It is important to understand the current situation. Have a close look at the areas of recruitment and selection; where people are in the organisation; promotion rates and appraisal scores; staff turnover; exit interviews; and pay and reward. Only then can you identify the sticky areas you need to address under your control.</p> <p>2. Do you reward &amp; promote fairly?</p> <p>Be honest with yourself. Do you wait for your staff to bid for pay rises or promotions? Do you unwittingly reward certain competencies more than others? Apply a gender equality lens to how you and your peers choose who to put forward for promotion. The <a href=\"http://www.bitcdiversity.org.uk/awards/on_awards_2012/advancing_women_in_the_workplace/addleshaw_goddard.html\" title=\"\">law firm Addleshaw Goddard </a>undertook a gender review of the way it was promoting people to its partner positions and changed it to be more inclusive and gender-balanced.</p> <p>3. Encourage coaching, mentoring or sponsorship</p> <p>Interventions targeted at tackling the sticky areas can be hugely effective. These include reverse mentoring (pair senior managers with more junior employees), co-coaching (peer coaching within an organisation or with external partners) and senior sponsorship. These must have mutually agreed objectives and timescales. These activities bring value to coach, sponsor, mentor and participant alike and are fantastic for identifying talent in the business.</p> <p>4. Embed agility: performance not 'presenteeism'</p> <p>Flexible working is a key enabler for women in the labour market, and is widely known to reduce overheads, sick days and attrition. Most jobs can be designed outside traditional working patterns to enable employees with external responsibilities or interests to contribute fully.</p> <p>Identify where this is possible in your team and encourage all employees to participate, not just working mothers, otherwise it risks becoming a new form of segregation. Always train your managers in how to manage a remote workforce. This is a policy<a href=\"http://www.bitcdiversity.org.uk/awards/on_awards_2012/agile_workplace/dell.html\" title=\"\"> Dell </a>followed when it allowed all employees to work remotely - now 65% of its UK workforce does so.</p> <p>5. Inclusive leadership: motivate from the top</p> <p>Are you an inclusive leader \u2013 do you encourage the creativity of non-homogenous groups and support organisational change? Visible leaders who 'walk the talk' are inspiring role models for every level of the organisation. Vodafone's inclusive <a href=\"http://www.bitcdiversity.org.uk/awards/on_awards_2010/case_studies/global_award/vodafone.html\" title=\"\">leadership programme</a> is aimed at increasing the number of female senior leaders and spans 21 countries, involving 250 senior executives.</p> <p>6. Lead by example</p> <p>Never underestimate the impact one senior individual can have on the wider organisation. Be a visible voice for diversity and equality. Push for training to counter unconscious bias; ensure there are rigorous and transparent promotions processes; set up mentoring, coaching and sponsorship circles, with senior peer participation; encourage your senior peers to re-evaluate how they identify, manage and reward talent \u2013 is it always like-for-like after a certain level?</p> <p>Some of these processes will inevitably taketime to set up and start delivering tangible results. Yet the rewards of implementing these will go beyond solely addressing the identified 'sticky' area; they will provide visible female role models, deliver agile working patterns that benefit all employees \u2013 not just women. They will support your organisation to keep its most valued talent and encourage diversity of thought.</p> <p><em>Helen Wells is director of </em><a href=\"http://www.bitcdiversity.org.uk/about_us/opportunity_now.html\" title=\"\"><em>Opportunity Now</em></a><em>, the gender equality campaign from </em><a href=\"http://www.bitcdiversity.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Business in the Community </em></a></p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>As copper prices approached \u00a35,000 a ton, it came as no surprise when the local police service reported that metal theft was on the rise. In just six months, thefts of metal had risen by 77% affecting community buildings, sports facilities, private homes and businesses.</p> <p>Together, the council and the police launched a project, working with on scrap metal dealers as the control point for the sale of potentially stolen goods. The three main scrap dealers in the are were visited and record keeping inspected.</p> <p>Under the 1964 Scrap Metal Dealers Act, scrap metal dealers are required to keep records of all metal purchased, including the customer's name, address and vehicle registration number. During those early visits, we found a wide variation in the accuracy and completeness of these records. We wrote to the yards, offering advice on consistent record keeping and invited staff to a meeting to discuss working together to tackle thefts.</p> <p>At that meeting with scrap yard operators we were able to agree upon a local code of practice, based upon the British Metals Recycling Association's existing protocols. The code included a \"no ID, no cash\" principle and included the installation of CCTV at all yards.</p> <p>Having signed up to the code, yards were then subjected to random checks and test purchases to ensure compliance. Scrap yard operators agreed to hand out leaflets to their customers, explaining registration requirements and their responsibilities in dealing with waste metal.</p> <p>Crime statistics show that following implementation of the project in December 2010, metal theft within the Forest of Dean stabilised. Regional crime statistics show that outside this area metal thefts are continuing to rise sharply.</p> <p>Metal theft is a shared problem, an issue that requires national attention. There is still a need for legislative reform. Now 47 years old, the scrap metal act was written for the Steptoe and Son era and fails to reflect the situation today. It requires no identification to be provided for registration, no financial reimbursement for registering local authorities and fines are disproportionate.</p> <p>We raised the issue with Norman Baker, under-secretary of state for transport \u2013 a sector which is struggling to tackle this crippling problem. The government has already made initial legislative changes in the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, which received Royal Assent in May. These amendments, expected to come into force in the autumn, prohibit a cash payment for scrap metal, amend police powers of entry to unregistered scrap metal sites and increase the financial penalties for offences under the Scrap Metal Dealers Act 1964.</p> <p>Further changes are proposed by a private members bill introduced by Croydon South MP Richard Ottaway, which seeks to replace the 1964 Act. The bill, which has just passed it second reading, has cross party support and aims to introduce compulsory registration of scrap dealers by local authorities.</p> <p>The proposed licensing regime will introduce a rigorous application process, and local authorities will have the power to refuse, vary and revoke licenses. All sellers will be required to provide verifiable ID to be recorded and retained by the operator, and there will be an outright ban on cash payments. Police will also be given powers to close unlicensed premises.</p> <p>There's no doubt the system needs to be more robust. The current situation is wide open to criminals targeting metal for quick financial gain. Our work shows what can be achieved at a local and regional level, but to achieve a long term sustainable impact it is clear that new legislation combined with effective enforcement is required.</p> <p>I fully support the proposals outlined in Richard Ottaway's bill. By implementing more stringent licensing controls and a cashless payment system, criminals will find it harder to remain anonymous.</p> <p><em>Matt Kirby is divisional environmental health officer at </em><a href=\"http://www.fdean.gov.uk/nqcontent.cfm?a_id=5280\" title=\"\"><em>Forest of Dean district council</em></a><em> </em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://localgovernmentjobs.guardian.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and </strong><a href=\"http://localgovernmentjobs.guardian.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>the latest jobs</strong></a><strong> direct to your inbox</strong></p>",

Roger Federer, the greatest player ever to grace the game of tennis, had just been demolished 6-2 6-1 6-4 in a shade under two hours by Andy Murray, who produced a performance of breathtaking power and passion to win the gold medal.</p> <p>Murray looked as stunned as everyone else when he produced a succession of aces to close out the match. Instead of sinking to the floor or leaping the net in the traditional manner, he just stood there. Then, after a few seconds, the realisation dawned - he had just annihilated his old nemesis and was Britain's first Olympic men's singles champion since Josiah Ritchie in 1908. Odd how 1908 is becoming the touchstone for so much at these Olympics.</p> <p>As Federer left the court - can he ever have suffered such a humiliation? - Murray, emulating Pat Cash when he became Wimbledon champion in 1987, scaled the stands to make his way into the box reserved for friends and family, where he embraced girlfriend, father, coaches and, finally, his mother, the indomitable Judy, who tempered the metal from which the gold was made. The ultimate alchemist.</p> <p>Last month, when he lost to Federer in the Wimbledon final, Murray blubbed, feeling he'd let down the hopes of a nation. This time he was completely in control - both during the match, in which he showed unrelenting concentration, and during the medal ceremony that followed. As he left the court with the gold round his neck, his final gesture was to shake the hand of a small boy at the side of the court. Don't wash that hand, son. Someday it will be worth a fortune on eBay.</p> <p>Afterwards, he said he had been inspired by both the crowd and the performances of his fellow athletes in Team GB. \"I watched the athletics last night, and it gave me a boost coming into today. The momentum the team's had the last couple of days has been so good.\"</p> <p>He said he was surprised to have won gold. \"I didn't expect that at the start of the week. I had a chance of going deep into the tournament, but I was a little bit tired after Wimbledon, and playing the mixed as well. But I felt so fresh. On the court today I didn't really feel nervous at all, apart from at the beginning of the match. I've had a lot of tough losses in my career, and this is the best way to come back. I'll never forget it.\"</p> <p>Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, but to be a union jack umbrella seller was very heaven. It bucketed down all morning at Wimbledon. But the rain relented just in time for the patriotic decision to be made to open the roof - all the pundits reckoned Murray's best chance was en plein air. Every cloud had a golden lining.</p> <p>Murray, who has never won a Grand Slam, had made it clear all week that this meant just as much as one of the big four titles. He was relishing playing for his country, and the crowd on centre court drove him on. When he broke Federer's serve early in the first set, the noise was enough to lift the roof - had it been on. The brutal forehand that secured the opening point of the next game produced another eruption. Federer had a few supporters in the crowd, but they were overwhelmed. The greatest player of all time was being swept away by a passionate Scot and his 15,000 acolytes.</p> <p>It was not always thus. \"I didn't used to like him - he was no Tim,\" said Sian Jenkins, who had taken up residence with a group of friends on Murray Mount (formerly Henman Hill). \"I started liking him when he showed some emotion after losing to Federer in the Wimbledon final. He really cares. You can see how much it means to him.\"</p> <p>Murray Mount was a sea of union flags, and there was hardly a saltire in sight - this has been a tricky week for Alex Salmond, with a vibrant new Britishness born before our eyes. The only St Andrew's crosses visible were painted on the faces of a family who had travelled down from Edinburgh, and even they were sitting on a large union flag.</p> <p>The Olympics at Wimbledon is subtly different from the annual championship. It's not just that Adele is blasting out on the concourse, white towels have replaced the Wimbledon-branded ones, and the posh stewards with purple arm bands have given way to policemen with machine guns. There is a different atmosphere; a more full-throated patriotism. For one week, the All-England club has become the All-British club, though chants of \"Team GB, Team GB\" still sound odd. This is Wimbledon, after all, not Wyoming.</p> <p>The second set turned on a monumental 15-minute game, when Federer - who was 2-0 down - tried to turn the screw on Murray. In the Wimbledon final, Murray had taken an early advantage and then been hauled back, but here he was indomitable, matching everything Federer could throw at him and saving six break points. \"We still love you, Roger,\" said one wag in the crowd - the low quality of waggishness is one thing which never changes at Wimbledon. Federer, seven times the champion here, can't often have been patronised.</p> <p>Federer's small band of fans refused to bow to what seemed inevitable. \"C'mon Roger,\" screamed one large British woman after every game. The Federer recusants - Brits who refused to toe the patriotic line - were an interesting bunch. \"He plays beautiful tennis,\" said a woman in red Federer ear-rings standing in the forlorn queue for return tickets before the match. \"And I don't like all the swearing on the court from Murray - it's just not necessary.\"</p> <p>On this occasion, it certainly wasn't necessary, and the undoubted beauty of Federer's groundstrokes counted for nothing. Everything Murray did was determined, decisive; he even snatched his towel decisively from a ballboy at the end of each game. This was his moment. Denied a grand slam - he has lost four grand slam finals, three of them to Federer - this was his chance at sporting immortality.</p> <p>Usually, in so one-sided a final, support would at some point switch to the underdog, but not this time. The scream that greeted the break of the Federer serve in the fifth game of the third set was visceral. Now, everyone believed Murray would win, and centre court was a sea of red, white and blue, save for one confused young man in the front row who was waving a Brazilian flag. Even the large lady had stopped shouting \"C'mon, Roger\".</p> <p>Murray was talking to himself perpetually, urging himself on; he had his foot on Federer's throat and didn't intend to release it. All he had to do now was hold his serve, which he did it with a string of aces that left Federer flailing. \"Andy had a clear plan,\" said Federer later, \"and never looked like he was doubting himself.\" He need never doubt himself again.</p>",
  "<p>It was beyond the \"wildest dreams\" of London 2012 chairman Lord Coe \u2013 a golden weekend that reaffirmed Britain's place at the top table of world sport, sparked a wave of euphoria across the country and further elevated soaring expectations for the rest of the Olympics.</p> <p>After the heroics of Jessica Ennis, Mo Farah and Greg Rutherford in the stadium on Saturday night, the medal charge continued on Sunday, with Ben Ainslie becoming the most successful Olympic sailor of all time and Andy Murray winning at Wimbledon.</p> <p>It was a stunning first week for the organisers of the London Games and Team GB officials. By Sunday night, Britain stood third in the medal table with 16 golds, half of them arriving on a single wild weekend.</p> <p>Coe said Saturday's magical sequence in the stadium was the best night of sport he had ever seen, topping Cathy Freeman's emotional gold in the 400m at the 2000 Sydney Games, on which he had modelled so much of his planning for London. \"This did edge it,\" he said. \"Particularly if you put it into context of what else was going on in the day, from the earliest moment with rowing. There was a narrative of infectious success. It probably was, for me, the greatest day of sport I've ever witnessed.\"</p> <p>It was 47 golden minutes that made London's Olympics and will form the basis of a concerted campaign to force the government to place sport at the heart of its education and health policies and protect funding and facilities.</p> <p>As Ennis was being introduced to a hysterical crowd ahead of an 800m that became a coronation, Rutherford was preparing to leap to a surprise gold medal.</p> <p>A few minutes later, the unheralded long jumper from Milton Keynes was preparing his final leap and taking the acclaim of the enraptured crowd as Farah was easing through the gears in a 10,000m final that would end with the Somalia-born, London-raised distance runner winning the first British gold in over a century.</p> <p>From a slow start, the medals have not stopped flowing since Helen Glover and Heather Stanning broke Team GB's duck at Eton Dorney on Wednesday, unleashing a wave of euphoria across the country.</p> <p>Saturday's six gold medals represented the best return in a single day since the first London Olympics in 1908 and left Team GB well on track to hit its pre-Games target of fourth in the medal table, delivering more medals in more sports than for over a century.</p> <p>The so-called \"Formula One\" sports that delivered so spectacularly in Beijing have continued their success. The \u00a3550m in lottery and exchequer funding over eight years poured into a high performance system overseen by UK Sport's Peter Keen, allied to the talent and dedication of driven athletes, have allowed rowing, cycling and sailing to deliver again. Keen believes there has been a shift from \"solo Alpinists\" to a system designed to underpin consistent success.</p> <p>But these Games have also showcased greater strength in depth. The sizeable investment has delivered vast improvements in those sports that have been able to convince the funding body UK Sport that they are now capable of competing for a medal under its ruthless \"no compromise\" funding formula.</p> <p>Peter Wilson won a shooting gold, Etienne Stott and Tim Baillie won the C2 canoe slalom and Gemma Gibbons fought her way to a silver in the judo.</p> <p>In athletics, still the blue riband event of the Games and the one in which it is arguably hardest to win medals, the rowing and cycling formula has started to pay off, too. \"What success does is breed confidence in the ability of athletes to deliver,\" said the British Olympic Association chairman, Lord Moynihan. \"It's an intangible. But if you go back to rowing it wasn't really until Steve Redgrave came along that they believed they could win. It wasn't until the [Katherine] Grainger era began that the women really believed they could win. \"If you see your own teammates deliver gold on the greatest sporting stage in the world, that self-belief is as important as the home nation advantage of crowds that have exceeded all expectation.\"</p> <p>A driven, imported coach in Charles van Commenee has been mixed with world-class coaching and a support service providing the best in sports science, psychology and nutrition.</p> <p>It has provided the platform for success that \u2013 with notable exceptions in Jonathan Edwards, Sally Gunnell, Linford Christie and Kelly Holmes \u2013 has proved elusive since Coe's own glory days in the mid-1980s.</p> <p>That uncompromising approach is personified by Van Commenee's take-no-prisoners approach \u2013 he has made clear his high expectations of a \"golden generation\" of athletes and promised to quit if they failed \u2013 and has also provoked a change of mindset.</p> <p>\"In previous years a lot of British athletes were just happy to make the teams,\" said Rutherford after his victory. \"Then people came through like me, Jess [Ennis], Dai Greene, Martyn Rooney, [Robbie] Grabarz, we were all juniors together and we had a different ethos. It was more about winning. It's the greatest night in British athletics history. I'm happy to be part of that.\"</p> <p>David Hemery, a gold medallist in 1968 in Mexico City, said: \"Before it was about individual athletes and coaches [but] we've got a system now and we've got a head coach who takes no prisoners.\"</p> <p>All of Britain's gold medallists have praised the crowd. It was also highlighted by the International Olympic Committee's director of the Olympic Games, Gilbert Felli, as he hailed a \"fantastic\" first half of the Games.</p> <p>But as they came down from their highon Sunday, there was also an insight into the huge pressure that has been heaped on the shoulders of Team GB's favourites to deliver at their home Games. \"Everyone was just expecting me to win,\" said Ennis. \"So I have had a few moments at home with my fiance worrying a bit and wondering if it was all going to go right \u2013 the way I wanted it to \u2013 or whether something would happen and it would fall apart, so it was a huge amount of pressure.</p> <p>Asked by Absolute Radio host Johnny Vaughan if her triumph had sunk in, she said: \"No, I'm still in shock. It's been a whirlwind and I'm just blown away by how many people are here. I slept with my medal beside me. It was an amazing feeling to wake up this morning and know that it wasn't a dream.\"</p> <p>Ainslie, famously as competitive on the water as he is polite off it, said it was not an experience he wanted to repeat. \"It's been incredibly hard, there's been huge pressure for people to perform at a home Games. It's been the hardest couple of weeks of my life and I haven't slept much the past couple of days,\" he said.</p> <p>Coe, Moynihan and others involved in British sport are determined to use the feelgood factor engendered by Britain's medal success to put the case for sport being at the heart of government health, education and social policy, as well as securing funding for elite sport.</p> <p>\"We need politicians to move forward by raising the bar significantly. Now is the time that athletes and the country will look to politicians and ask them to step up to the mark,\" said Moynihan.</p> <p>Coe, who sat next to David Cameron on Saturday night, said the prime minister was enthused about the possibilities of capitalising on the performances of GB athletes beyond the Games. \"He was very seized by the need to build on everything he was seeing in that stadium, whether it was the extraordinary performances of our teams, the ongoing challenges of getting more young people into sport, and the extraordinary potential for the economic legacy,\" he said.</p> <p>\"He is very seized by the need to leverage legacy from every nook and cranny of the project. There is a limited window of opportunity.\"</p> <p>For the heptathlete who has coped with being the face of these Games for the last four years, and maintained her steely focus to win the gold medal that could define them, there are more pressing concerns.</p> <p>\"I'm definitely going to relax, eat lots of rubbish food, have a few glasses of wine and enjoy this moment for as long as possible,\" said Ennis.</p>",
  "<p>At the beginning of this year I bemoaned <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2012/jan/30/patient-from-hell-nhs-it-champions\" title=\"\">that GPs no longer understood IT</a>. Five months later, however, I cheered because the NHS Hackday showed that a lot of clinicians do in fact want clunky NHS IT systems to be improved and are prepared, if only for a weekend, to get down in the mud with loads of geeks and get their hands dirty writing innovative medical Apps (and I am delighted to hear that one of these Apps, <a href=\"http://www.ehi.co.uk/news/ehi/7949/patient-list-to-launch-open-source-app\" title=\"\">Patient List, is to be released as open source</a>).</p> <p>But, sadly, in an increasingly digitalised NHS, geeky clinicians are a rare breed. What about the majority of doctors \u2013 how much do they understand? And, more importantly, what are they taught about IT in medical school?</p> <p>Not a lot from what I've seen in <a href=\"http://www.cln.nhs.uk/eice/learning-to-manage\" title=\"\">Learning to manage health information</a>, a 56-page document produced by the Department of Health's embedding informatics in clinical education (eICE) team. It sums this up by admitting that \"many healthcare professionals continue to have limited or no education in informatics and yet the expectations of them to manage information effectively is a current and increasing requirement.\"</p> <p>I get the impression that although the eICE team was set up in 1999 and has been bashing away relentlessly, it has not made much progress in educating the lumpen mass of clinicians to make them ready for the digital age.</p> <p>Many of them still seem not to have got their heads around relatively simple national stand-alone systems, some of which have been around for years, like Choose and Book, e-prescribing and Summary Care records. My GP surgery seems to have had no difficulty with implementing these systems so it can be done.</p> <p>Assuming that most clinicians have achieved some keyboard skills over the years and can write emails and manipulate spreadsheets, doesn't mean they have a real understanding of what they ought to know about IT or how it can improve the care they provide to patients and make their own lives easier. What is scary is how much there is for them to learn.</p> <p>Just look at what they have to get their heads around right now; electronic health records, for a start, are changing the relationships between clinicians and healthcare teams, but security problems need solving by clinicians as well as by IT experts.</p> <p>Telehealth and telecare require them to master all types of physical and psychological measurements and remote monitoring, and throw away the conventional way of treating patients. Public health education and information requires them to use different media channels to inform citizens, both healthy individuals and patients, about medical and health topics and to increase self-help. They also have to deal with patients, who diagnose themselves on the internet and just visit the doctor for confirmation of the research they have done.</p> <p>Then they need to get a grasp of what is involved in giving patients access to their records \u2013 and even make changes. Medical Research Using eHealth Grids means learning to control powerful computing and data management capabilities to handle large amounts of heterogeneous data.</p> <p>The mind boggles. There are also clinical coding systems, like Read Codes and Snomed, and more generally, they need to understand the need to standardise procedures and data, and the importance and limitations of interoperability.</p> <p>Now there is also the new mobile world, which will revolutionise the life of doctors on the wards. And social networking, useful for campaigns and for patients to communicate with each other, but can have pitfalls for healthcare professionals. And who knows, they may get around some day to using email as a bog-standard way of contacting their patients.</p> <p>And finally, there is the ability to suss out technological snake-oil salesmen.</p> <p>Will they catch up? I doubt it. The eICE report ends by saying: \"It is recommended that commissioners and providers consider the need for catch up or consolidation programmes, based on the guidance in this framework.\" So we are back in the hands of the GP commissioners, who have too much on their plate already, and who have not shown much inclination in the past to improve their IT knowledge, or initiate IT systems for the benefit of their patients.</p> <p>To suddenly realise the importance of the digital revolution and be ready to commit resources to educating their clinical colleagues would be out of character. I don't hold out much hope.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/healthcare/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian Healthcare Network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",
  "<p>The world had wondered: openly, loudly, some may even say rudely, if Usain Bolt was ready. There were rumours of injury, speculation over his commitment to training, worries over his wavering form, suggestions that the triple world record holder might even be psychologically damaged \u2013 from last year's false start in the world championships final, from the car crash in June, from his defeat at the hands of his training partner Yohan Blake in Kingston, Jamaica, just five weeks ago. But when that gun went in the 100m final Bolt delivered one almighty response to anyone who had dared to question him, dared to dream of beating him.</p> <p>Crossing the line in an Olympic record of 9.63sec, the 25-year-old became the first man to defend an Olympic sprint title since Carl Lewis in 1988. Legend? Job done. What did Bolt have to say to the doubters? \"I have nothing to say,\" said the two-times Olympic champion. \"I said it on the track. All they can do is talk. I said when it comes to the championships it's all about me.\" Did he ever doubt his own ability? \"I was slightly worried about my start, so I sat in the blocks a bit, but I executed and that was the key. My coach said, 'Stop worrying about your start, your best race is at the end.'\"</p> <p>The Jamaican had to work hard for a victory in which a record seven out of eight men ran under 10 seconds but once Bolt had made up the deficit of his awkward start and drawn level alongside the four fastest men in the field it was easy for him to pull away. At 50 metres Bolt was already going away, just as his compatriot Asafa Powell dropped back, hit by injury. From thereon in the win, although tight, never looked in doubt.</p> <p>Yohan Blake, the 21-year-old world champion who had twice inflicted defeat on Bolt in recent weeks, was left fighting the two Americans alongside him to take silver. He needed to equal his personal best of 9.75 to do it. On the line Justin Gatlin timed his dip perfectly to snatch bronze from his team-mate Tyson Gay in 9.79 \u2013 a miraculous return to the sport for the 2004 Olympic champion who served a four-year suspension after testing positive for a banned substance in 2006. At the finish both Powell, the former world record holder who has never won a global title, and Gay, the second fastest man in history who has never won an Olympic medal, appeared devastated.</p> <p>Bolt's victory was emphatic and, as the evening had progressed, it had looked ever more likely. In those last few minutes on the warm-up track Bolt and Blake provided an image reminiscent of Bolt's demeanour before his 100m victory in Beijing four years ago.</p> <p>Joking about together, as though back on the training ground at their Kingston track, they were as relaxed as anyone can be ahead of such a momentous event. Playful as ever, Bolt had toyed with the TV camera that spied on them, leaping left and then right, in and out of vision with seemingly boundless energy as though the fact that he was about to attempt to defend the first of his Olympic titles was not even on his mind. In Beijing, so the story goes, he had been the same, rolling about on the floor, play-fighting with his agent.</p> <p>Earlier in the evening, in the semi- finals, Bolt had already begun to turn on the speed. Crossing the line in 9.87, the third fastest semi-finalist, Bolt wagged his finger as if to say: did you doubt me? Now you know the answer. Like a knife through butter, Bolt had run easy, languid, assured, as soon as he turned on the accelerators the competition, including Britain's Dwain Chambers, fell away unable even to hang on to his coat tails. Of all the semi-finalists, it was Bolt who looked the most comfortable. That was the giveaway. There lay the hint of what was to come. Not the time as such but the manner in which he won. Glancing right and left before leisurely crossing the line, Bolt was back in his formidable stride.</p> <p>The performance lay in sharp contrast to his first-round performance on Saturday morning that had kept onlookers guessing. The Jamaican had run the slowest winning time of all seven heats, only 10.09. The Americans blasted their way out of the blocks and powering to record speeds \u2013 first Gatlin in 9.97, and then 23-year-old Ryan Bailey in 9.88. Set against that background one could not help wondering if Bolt might be missing a trick. Some accused him of playing a poker game; others simply believed that he was not up to the job. Either way there was reasonable doubt, and a final medal prediction looked difficult to call.</p> <p>With Jamaica celebrating 50 years of independence, the national anthem already having rung out around the stadium during the medal ceremony for Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce's 100m victory, it was a Jamaica sprint double.</p> <p>Wrapped in the green, black and gold of the Jamaican flag, Bolt and Blake performed their victory lap, the older athlete paying tribute to the younger man. \"He works harder than me,\" Bolt said of the youngster known as \"The Beast\". \"He will do better next time because he was a little bit stressed this time.\" Bolt's legacy may prove to be far more than simply securing his own status as a legend. He may well have secured a golden future for generations of Jamaican sprinters.</p>",

  "<p>The words \"police rap\" conjure echoes of Grange Hill's Zammo and Roland awkwardly bopping around to some ill-conceived rhymes created to appeal exclusively to teachers and social workers. Add to the mix the Thames Valley town of High Wycombe, hardly the Bronx, and it all seems a bit, well, excruciating.</p> <p>But when Thames Valley police decided to put out <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpLeEis7D_8\" title=\"\">a rap single to help promote an anti-gang culture message</a>, that was precisely what they wanted to avoid.</p> <p>They've pulled it off. An Eye For An Eye sounds and feels like any other mainstream rap and there's not a bow-tied headmaster in sight.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RpLeEis7D_8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RpLeEis7D_8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The project was conceived after the police observed rival gangs posting antagonistic videos designed to bait each other on YouTube.</p> <p>\"We were looking at targeting an age group of anything from 12 to 20 and so we needed something fresh and relevant and that young people would actually identify with,\" says detective inspector Colin Seaton.</p> <p>The track itself was created by local DJ, LoMotes, along with grime artists Styler, Sicx, Dimples and Treasure, all of whom donated their time and resources for nothing.</p> <p>Filmed in Wycombe town centre and around local gang hot-spots, the video features a slick and catchy rap with a simple message, \"An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind\". It looks at the consequences (not least, jail) of gun crime and showcases some emerging talent in the process. The rap is <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/eye-for-eye-feat.-lola-coca/id538627667\" title=\"\">available on iTunes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/feat-Styler-Dimples-Treasure-Explicit/dp/B008DO6QXK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340720713&amp;sr=8-2\" title=\"\">Amazon to download</a> and all proceeds go towards the Ben Kinsella Trust, set up in memory of the 16-year-old school boy stabbed to death in London in June 2008, and other local youth community projects.</p> <p>With more than 14,000 views on YouTube and retweets by US rappers, it's becoming an unlikely internet hit, partly due to the fact that the police have made their involvement unknown.</p> <p>Wycombe might not seem to be the most desperate or needy place in the Thames Valley (it's one of the wealthiest regions in the EU) but, says Seaton: \"Frankly, any stabbing is one too many. In our most recent shooting in January we made 12 arrests with the youngest just 12 years old, so anything we can do to prevent things like that happening we will.</p> <p>\"We can arrest people and lock them up but at the end of the day it's more deep-rooted than that.\"</p> <p>The force already works with its Gang Multi-Agency Partnership (GMap) team to identify new ways of targeting gangs and keeping them out of the criminal justice system. It's already run a Coveritlive event, a community meeting online whereby people can log on to a liveblogging platform and ask any questions (including those on how the police are tackling gang crime), during which they streamed the video, to a positive response.</p> <p><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/djlomotes\" title=\"\">Twenty-seven-year-old DJ LoMotes</a> (aka Ghana-born Larry Lomotey) admits he was a bit worried at first that the project might end up being a bit \"forced\" but in the end, he says, \"I had complete creative control\".</p> <p>Lomotey chose the artists, the studio and the vibe and their only remit was that the song contained an anti-gang message. All the artists, including Lomotey, have grown up with the threat of gang crime, if not in the heart of it (Lomotey has been threatened at knifepoint), so they all had something to say.</p> <p>\"None of the artists had written a word until they came into the studio,\" says Lomotey, \"but I played a loop and they rapped and sang. It was impressive. At the end of three days we had two really great songs\". The second of which he plans to release for free in September.</p> <p>The collaboration isn't ending here. Lomotey and Thames Valley police are keen to do more and after the collective has performed at the <a href=\"http://www.wycombeartsfestival.org/\" title=\"\">High Wycombe Festival</a> on 5 August, Lomotey plans to do something annually, perhaps even creating a regular music festival around the collective.</p> <p>\"What we mainly want,\" though, he says with a smile, \"is for people to love, and buy, the song.\"</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/social-care-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-social-care-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the social care network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",
  "<p>Mike Thiedke was training to be a primary school teacher when a lecturer noticed his analytical skills and suggested an academic career instead. Thiedke went on to complete a PHd in children's rights and participation. The research took him to the townships of South Africa where hesaw work that he wanted to do in the field of international development. He says: \"I liked the international element of the work and if academic life wasn't enough for me I thought I could use my skills in a more practical way to help the disadvantaged.\"</p> <p>As a volunteer in the Cape Town townships Thiedke helped establish health centres in schools, working on a range of education and relief projects with young people. He says: \"I wasn't shocked by what I saw. I'm not shocked when I see people living in terrible conditions because it doesn't help them. What helps them is if I see their reality, and have a respectful relationship with them and try and see what needs to be done.\" This pragmatic approach doesn't mean that Thiedke lacks passion \u2013 he just shows it in a different way. He says: \"Lots of people are moved by a 'bleeding heart.' But pity doesn't help people. You need to truly understand the situation and find ways out of it \u2013 that's passion. I am quite an emotional person but it's about being measured about your emotion and channelling that into being practical.\"</p> <p>Thiedke's PHd included a six-month internship at the United Nations in New York which led to a job on its youth engagement programme. He then went on to become project manager for preparedness of the UN's own staff for a possible swine flu pandemic. He says: \"Originally my boss didn't want me \u2013 she wanted somebody with medical experience who knew about Avian Flu. I said that what she really needed was somebody trained in project management who had analytical skills who could get things done.\" He regards his work on the swine flu project as one of his career highlights: \"It was quite a difficult task \u2013 we started off talking about body bags and had to turn this into strategy and appraisal. But I built the plan and it's something I am proud of.\" He stayed with the UN for another two years becoming business manager for emergency planning and preparedness, before reaching a crossroads. He could either \"take the comfortable and lazy route\" and carve himself a career at the UN or seek fresh challenges. \"I had to make a personal decision \u2013 I wanted to go back to Europe and I think I was too young to get stuck in the UN system,\" he says.</p> <p>But he acknowledges it was at the UN where he honed his communication skills. \"What I learnt in that international arena was diplomatic skills and to be truly respectful in the way you engage with people \u2013 that is what you need [when you want] to convince people. I behave in a diplomatic way without being fluffy. I'm direct with people \u2013 without being rude \u2013 and that usually works. I think that's what makes a good communicator because you come across as genuine.\"</p> <p>His ticket back to Europe came as international head of child sponsorship and support for the international charity, <a href=\"http://www.actionaid.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Action Aid</a>. It was an organisation he had come across working in Cape Town and he liked the methods it used in the field motivating young people. \"That links back to everything I've been saying \u2013 it's all about doing something in a constructive and respectful way.\" Although he hadn't worked in fundraising before he was confident that he had the skills to lead on its flagship child sponsorship programme: \"I think fundraising requires a lot of basic skills which I had. I think I had enough for the job that I was asked to do.\" It's this confidence and tenacity \u2013 reflected in his record at the UN where he increased the number of young people on its youth participation programme 10-fold \u2013 which has stood him in good stead. In his three years at <a href=\"http://www.actionaid.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Action Aid</a> he has been interim international director of fundraising and communications and interim executive director of the charity's US division. One of his greatest achievement's there so far was identifying the \"disconnect\" between the child sponsorship programme and the rest of the charity's work and bringing the two together in a new global strategy underpinned by education and youth work.</p> <p>As he looks to the future Thiedke thinks he might go for a chief executive role or maybe return to the UN although he says: \"It's not on my radar at the moment.\" Whatever his ultimate decision, Thiedke's unswerving belief in mutual respect and that nobody is off-limits will help take him to the top. He says: \"I think it is a privilege coming from an educated background. When I came to the UN I came with the attitude that I could talk to the Secretary General \u2013 there is nothing that makes that impossible \u2013 he is an interesting man and I have something to say. Then I find myself having coffee with Kofi Annan \u2013 I don't have boundaries. It's not disrespectful. You might call it naivety. Back then I was in my youth, but I am now in my late 30s and I'm still doing the same thing.\"</p> <p><em>Mike Thiedke was named Charity Voice 2012 in the annual award organised by PR company Porter Novelli and the Media Trust charity.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<h2>Texas twists</h2> <p>It's been a tough few months for Josh Hamilton. The Texas Rangers outfielder has seen his batting average <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=hamiljo03&amp;t=b&amp;year=\">drop over 80 points since the end of May,</a> heard <a href=\"http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120728&amp;content_id=35695086&amp;c_id=tex\">heard boos from the once adoring Arlington crowd</a> and been <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/blog/eye-on-baseball/19645968/nolan-ryan-calls-out-josh-hamilton-for-giving-away-at-bats\">called out for giving up at bats</a> by the president and CEO, Nolan Ryan. It hasn't helped that the Rangers were 9-14 in July after going 50-29 to start the season. Since the calendar flipped to August, first-placed Texas have gone 4-2, but trouble is still following Hamilton, who will be a free agent after the season.</p> <p>Towards the end of July, Hamilton fed the <a href=\"http://www.star-telegram.com/2012/08/03/4152363/slumping-josh-hamilton-clarifies.html?storylink=digger-topic\">Fort Worth Star Telegram</a> comments that were described as \"cryptic\" by the local press.</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"When the time is right, I'll be honest with you, you'll be right in the loop. I've been shown a lot of things over the past week. There's disobedience and there's obedience to God. I've been being disobedient. It may be a small thing to you, but it's a big thing to him. There's consequences. It's like a father and a kid. There are disciplines. You guys can chew on that and think about it.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This led to a frenzy of speculation surrounding the outfielder, who has struggled with alcohol and substance abuse and relapsed last winter at a Texas bar. Some believed the slugger, who despite the prolonged slump still has 29 home runs, just two behind the AL leader, Adam Dunn, was going through a divorce, or perhaps suffered another relapse. With the rumors running wild in Ranger land, Hamilton released a statement on Friday. </p> <p>\"I felt it was important to clarify what the issue was to which I was referring, both personally and professionally. The issue is discipline,\" his statement read. \"Professionally, it's been plate discipline. Personally, it's been being obedient to the Lord in quitting chewing tobacco.\"</p> <p>Hamilton continued: \"I was hesitant to address the tobacco once again, because it's an area that I've struggled with trying to quit in the past. I wanted to have some time of success under my belt before addressing again publicly, but feel I haven't been given that option with all of the speculation out there as to what the mystery issue was. But there you have it \u2013 discipline.\"</p> <p>Hamilton's struggle with the bat and his tobacco addiction isn't the only issue on the club, and while it may be premature to slap the Team Turmoil label on the Rangers, the sailing certainly hasn't been smooth lately in Arlington. Closer Joe Nathan revealed on Saturday that he has a<a href=\"http://rangersblog.dallasnews.com/2012/08/joe-nathan-nothiung-wrong-with-arm-or-elbow-just-feeling-a-ltitle-fatigued.html/\"> dead arm</a>, stating that the condition has nothing to do with his surgically-repaired right elbow. The 37-year old hasn't thrown since Thursday and has given up four runs in his last two outings, and seven runs over his previous seven innings.</p> <p>Then there's the issue surrounding Roy Oswalt, who pitched out of the bullpen on Thursday and Sunday after going 3-2 with an ERA of over 6.00 since joining the team in late June. With Ryan Dempster joining from Chicago at the trade deadline and Scott Feldman pitching well, Oswalt was the reluctant odd man out of the rotation.</p> <p>\"Well, I mean we're 4-2 in the games I started. I guess I should've been 6-0. Two bad ones and won four of them so... I don't know. We'll see how it goes.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It wasn't my decision,\" Oswalt continued. \"I'm down there to throw when they need me, I guess... I don't know how long it's going to last.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Manager Ron Washington said it would be up to Oswalt how long he stayed in the pen, but that may have been lip service considering Feldman has won his last six decisions. On Sunday, Oswalt <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120805&amp;content_id=36192118&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb\">told his manager he couldn't go another inning after throwing two.</a> Should the situation with the unhappy hurler escalate, the Rangers could put him on waivers and hope someone snatches up the veteran starter, who is still owed $4.5m this season.</p> <p>After taking two of three in Kansas City this weekend, Texas will face challenging teams in Boston, Detroit and New York over the next 10 days.</p> <h2>Is this it?</h2> <p>The baseball world has been waiting for the Detroit Tigers to take control of a division that was awarded to them in Spring Training \u2013 waiting and waiting and waiting. It has been a season of false dawns for the Tigers, a ballclub that came within two victories of reaching the World Series last October.</p> <p>The strength of the team is in their offense. There's been a breakout season from Austin Jackson, a fully functioning one-two punch of Prince Fielder and Miguel Cabrera and now a third musketeer in Brennan Boesch, which <a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20120804/OPINION03/208040414/1361/Tigers%E2%80%99-new-3-4-5-hitters-have-the-look-of-a-winning-combination\">for one Detroit writer</a> is a group conjuring up memories of Al Kaline, Norm Cash and Willie Horton. Still, despite the success of this weekend, albeit a sweep against faltering Cleveland, overall, Detroit's offense has only mustered up the seventh-most runs in the American League. The pitching staff didn't have the billing of Detroit's bats, but their performance has also been middle of the road, with the bullpen being slightly more reliable than the starters.</p> <p>Luckily for these Tigers, the American League Central is a division that won't make you pay for such sputtering. Detroit are just 1.5 games behind the surprising first-place Chicago White Sox and have won five straight in reaching their high-water mark for the season, nine games over .500.</p> <p>Tigers fans are hoping that their dramatic victory on Sunday is the springboard for the remainder of the 2012 season. Down two runs in the 10th inning with two outs and nobody on, Tribe closer Chris Perez issued a pair of walks to Alex Avila and Andy Dirks. Jackson drove home a run with a double, then Omar Infante's single tied it at eight. Cabrera came up and capped the improbable comeback with a <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=23651103&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_23651103&amp;v=3\">two-run blast</a> that sent spiraling Cleveland to their ninth straight defeat.</p> <p>Before Tigers fans pop the cork on the champagne, we've seen this sort of surge before. Between 4 July and 22 July Detroit enjoyed a 13-2 run that included a sweep of the White Sox and a brief ascension into first place. Bad habits returned as they then dropped four of their next six games to slide back into second before rebounding against Cleveland. They host the Yankees for four games to start the week before flying to Texas for a weekend series.</p> <h2>Ray of light</h2> <p>There's good news on the horizon for fans of the Tampa Bay Rays. Out of the lineup since the end of April, <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/news/evan-longoria-return-dl-tuesday-211129336--mlb.html\">Evan Longoria is on his way back to the big club</a>, a move that will boost a sagging offense getting set for the 2012 stretch run. The 2012 Rays were always going to be about young pitching and just enough offense. With Longoria out of the lineup for over three months, Tampa have only mustered up enough runs to be ranked 12 of 14 teams, down from their 2011 run ranking of eighth. Longoria hit for a .994 OPS in 23 games this season before a hamstring injury forced the young slugger on the shelf. With Longoria on the field the Rays are 15-8 and with the third baseman on the DL they are 41-44.</p> <p>Rays fans can thank their pitching staff for staying in the race. Tampa's young arms have the best ERA in the American League, and are more or less responsible for keeping the team afloat. Having Longoria, who will be limited to DH starting Tuesday, back in the lineup should, theoretically, provide enough offense to propel the them into the playoffs. <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/sports/baseball/rays/article1244508.ece\">The Tampa Bay Times tells us</a> that the Rays have scored three or fewer runs in 11 of their 14 games, totals Longoria should be able impact once he gets up to speed.</p> <p>On Sunday, manager Joe Maddon told the Tampa Bay Times:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It definitely does something different to your lineup regarding who hits where, that kind of stuff. No question it would have some kind of positive impact. A hitter of his magnitude in your lineup always does. But my expectations aren't that he's just going to come in and just start railing on the baseball... I believe he's going to have to work his way through it and get back up to speed with major-league baseball players playing in August.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Even with Longoria, the website <a href=\"http://www.coolstandings.com/baseball_standings.asp?sn=2012&amp;i=1\">coolstandings.com</a> doesn't think Tampa Bay are playoff material, giving the Rays just a 19.7% chance of taking a wild-card spot as of Monday. The saber-metric website gives the Tigers a 26.5% chance, the Angels a 36.1% chance, the A's a 35.6% chance and the Red Sox just a 14.6% chance.</p> <h2>No Reyes of light</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394428412\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/4/4/1333553942902/Miami-Marlins-shortstop-J-007.jpg\" alt=\"Miami Marlins shortstop Jose Reyes\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miami Marlins shortstop Jose Reyes has turned it on \u2013 too late.

Unfortunately for Miami and their fans, it comes after the Marlins have fallen out of the race. Reyes has put together a garbage-time hitting streak of 24 games, during which he is hitting at a clip approaching .400.</p> <p>Yes, it has been an impressive run for the shortstop who left New York to sign a seven-year, $106m contract with Miami, a team that also signed a host of other pricey free agents this offseason, including Mark Buehrle and Heath Bell. No, overall it has not worked out at all for manager Ozzie Guillen, who was also supposed to be a big addition to the team, and his club now find themselves fighting to stay out of the cellar with another team that unexpectedly floundered, the Philadelphia Phillies. At least the Phills had something of an excuse, losing Chase Utley and Ryan Howard for most of the season. Miami has none \u2013 the talent was there, but the wins were not.</p> <p>At the center of the storm surrounding the Marlins disappointing season was Hanley Ramirez, now with LA, but Reyes, meant to be the catalyst of this team, must also take a large hit for its failure. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2011/dec/09/albert-pujols-jose-reyes-la-angels\">Many Mets fans were reluctant to see one of their franchise cornerstones leave town</a> over the winter, myself included. However, it's time to start wondering whether Reyes is just one of those players who struggles to win in big spots. The Mets collapsed down the stretch for many reasons in 2007 and 2008 and one of them was Reyes, who hit .205 and then .243 in those Septembers to forget. In the spring of 2009 I can remember watching <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/extra/baseball/wbbc/recap?gameId=290310118\">Holland upset the Dominican Republic, not once but twice,</a> and seeing Reyes looking confounded on the bench. I recall thinking: \"Oh man, it's Reyes, he's a losing ballplayer!\" Reyes battled injuries the next few seasons, bad ones for New York, before winning the batting title a year ago on another bad Mets team. This season, front and center, on a team with the talent to win, Reyes failed to lead his club to victories. Again, the Marlins have more issues than Reyes, but the contract he signed was for more than just hits and steals \u2013 it was to take responsibility for a team with expectations.</p> <p>Now, with the Marlins in the NL East basement and the team in sell-mode, Reyes has finally turned it on \u2013 much, much too late.</p> <h2>The Voice</h2> <p>There may be no baseball activity more inviting than listening in to a Dodgers game and hearing \"The Voice\", regardless of whether or not you are a fan of the team. Of all the debates involving the game of baseball, the question of who is the best broadcaster in the booth is answered quickly and concisely by nearly all fans. It is Vin Scully, who has been calling Dodgers games, mostly on his own, going back to 1950 when the team was located in Brooklyn.</p> <p>Scully's voice calms instantly and personally, knowing that he may not be long for the microphone, I'm taking in every word as often as possible. I am not alone of course, and proof of his reach was showcased on Saturday when Scully decided he would try provide a boost to Dodgers catcher AJ Ellis by employing the powers of Twitter. Scully, inspired by Ellis' two home runs in LA's 6-1 victory over the Cubs, thought it would be \"cool\" to get #AJEllis trending on the social network, and asked fans to chip in. Scully always impresses, but embracing social networking tools that were nowhere to be found 62 years ago when the Bronx born Scully moved into the booth at Brooklyn's Ebbets Field, represents an amusing high-water mark for the iconic broadcaster. At Scully's request <a href=\"http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120804&amp;content_id=36123876&amp;notebook_id=36125738&amp;vkey=notebook_la&amp;c_id=la\">#AJEllis was trending on Twitter in the United States,</a> and the Dodgers catcher picked up about 800 followers on the night. That counts as major progress for the 84-year-old Scully, who <a href=\"http://content.usatoday.com/communities/dailypitch/post/2012/08/vin-scullys-world-collides-with-twitter-with-magical-results/1\">days earlier</a> was referring to tweets as \"a twitter\" or \"twit\". </p> <p>.</p>"
