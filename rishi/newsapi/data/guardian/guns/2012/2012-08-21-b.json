  "<p>More than 100 quangos have been abolished since the government took office, saving the taxpayer at least \u00a31.4bn by 2015, according to Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister.</p> <p>But he said the one-off transition costs associated with the programme \u2013 described by the National Audit Office (NAO) as the largest restructuring of public bodies for many decades \u2013 could be as much as \u00a3900m, which is higher than some original estimates.</p> <p>Maude said the government was on course to meet its aim of abolishing 204 public bodies by 2015, and said this would create a net saving of at least \u00a32.6bn \u2013 although the NAO said in a report this year that departments had failed to explain precisely how these savings would be achieved.</p> <p>David Cameron said before the general election that promising a \"bonfire of the quangos\" would be too simplistic, but the phrase has often been used to describe the coalition's plan to abolish or merge many of the 900 public bodies it inherited.</p> <p>When parliament passed the Public Bodies Act last year, giving ministers new powers to abolish quangos, Maude said this would save \u00a32.6bn. In a progress report on Wednesday, he said 106 public bodies had already disappeared. A further reduction in the quango count has been achieved by merging more than 150 bodies into fewer than 70.</p> <p>The Cabinet Office said the cuts already implemented would save \u00a31.4bn by 2015, after transition costs such as redundancy payments are taken into account. It aims to have abolished 204 bodies by the end of this parliament and to have reduced the quango count by a further 100 through mergers.</p> <p>In its January report, the NAO accused the government of underestimating the transition costs. \"Departments' estimates of \u00a3425m for the transition costs of these reorganisations are incomplete,\" it said. \"[The NAO] estimates that they will be at least \u00a3830m.\"</p> <p>Now the Cabinet Office says it expects the transition costs to be \"between \u00a3600m and \u00a3900m\".</p> <p>A spokeswoman said the government had never publicly used the \u00a3425m figure quoted in the NAO report because it was a partial figure covering only some departments.</p> <p>She said there was no need for the government to revise down the \u00a32.6bn figure for projected net savings because when the Cabinet Office first quoted this it was assuming transition costs of \u00a3600m-\u00a3900m.</p> <p>In its report, the NAO said many of the quangos being earmarked for closure were not a burden on the taxpayer. Of the \u00a32.6bn due to be saved, 34% was coming from two cuts, the abolition of regional development agencies and of the British Educational Communications and Technology Agency, the NAO said. It pointed out that two-thirds of the quangos being abolished spent nothing in 2009-10.</p> <p>Maude said the \u00a32.6bn target was the equivalent of \u00a3150 saved for every working household in the country.</p> <p>\"In 2010 we inherited a bloated quangocracy that had spiralled out of control. Not only were these unaccountable bodies costing the taxpayer billions, but they were duplicating bureaucracy,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Once we have completed the planned closures and mergers, we will continue to review all remaining quangos to ensure that never again will we end up with so many of these vast bureaucratic and unaccountable bodies.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Institute of Directors is to put further pressure on George Osborne by urging him to take urgent steps to promote investment, as it says business is \"battening down the hatches\" for the rest of the year.</p> <p>The IoD said most firms had delayed investment decisions and employing new staff after taking the view that growth this year would be worse than last year.</p> <p>\"Business is battening down the hatches in the expectation that the recession will continue for the rest of the year. That is bad news for the economy at large, because decisions to invest money or take on more staff are being postponed until things look up,\" Graham Leach, chief economist at the IoD, said. \"Low confidence leads to delayed decisions, and delayed decisions further undermine economic confidence \u2013 it's a vicious cycle.\"</p> <p>Leach said the government's agenda was \"pointing in broadly the right direction, but the overwhelming opinion of our members is that they are doing too little, too slowly\". He called for cuts to red tape and simplification of employment law to \"make a real difference to the cost and complexity of doing business in the UK\".</p> <p>The sharp fall in manufacturing output revealed on Tuesday added to the gloom following a survey by the CBI that revealed expectations for growth during the autumn have evaporated.</p> <p>The figures are a blow to the chancellor, who has seen his forecasts for deficit reduction and growth skid wildly off track. Analysts said that by next April Osborne could overshoot his spending target by up to \u00a340bn if growth continues to flatline and government spending outstrips tax receipts, forcing him to accept higher debt levels or consider further austerity measures.</p> <p>The Institute of Directors said a poll of its members revealed a lack of confidence in the government's growth forecasts. It said most firms had delayed investment decisions and employing new staff after taking the view that growth this year would be worse than last year.</p> <p>The IoD joined a wide range of business lobby groups and opposition parties to call on Osborne to promote investment and growth to prevent the recession dragging into the second half of the year.Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Rachel Reeves, said the chancellor's promise to secure the recovery and get the deficit down was in tatters. \"His failed plan has delivered the exact opposite - a double dip recession which is leading to soaring borrowing. What more evidence does the government need that their plan has failed and they need to change course?\"</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChukaUmunna/status/237834865582682112\" title=\"\">Shadow business secretary Chuka Ummuna tweeted</a>: \"Yet more evidence of the Government's economic incompetence but will Cameron, Clegg, Cable and co change course?\"</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said public sector net borrowing, excluding bank bailouts, showed a deficit of \u00a3557m, compared with a \u00a32.8bn surplus in the same month last year. Analysts had been expecting a surplus of \u00a32.5bn. The data heightens concerns that the government will miss its deficit reduction target.</p> <p>The ONS said the total deficit since April had reached \u00a347.2bn \u2013 up \u00a311.6bn on 2011 \u2013 excluding financial interventions and a one-off boost after assets from the Royal Mail's pension fund were transferred to the Treasury. Vicky Redwood, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the figures \"continue the deterioration seen over the past few months. At this rate, borrowing for 2012/13 overall will massively overshoot the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast of \u00a3120bn, excluding Royal Mail effects, by over \u00a335bn.</p> <p>\"And with the recovery falling well short of the OBR's expectations, we think that the government will struggle to cut borrowing at all next year.\"</p> <p>July is usually a buoyant month for tax receipts, but this year the corporate sector has been hit hard by the downturn. ONS figures showed North Sea oil and gas output has been unusually low, leading to lower profits and a cut in tax payments.</p> <p>The impact of a near 20% drop in corporation tax receipts was to push government receipts down 0.8% in July on the same period last year.</p> <p>Government spending, meanwhile, grew 5.1% on the previous year, mostly on welfare payments. Lower revenues from oil and gas companies accounted for about \u00a31bn of a \u00a31.7bn shortfall in corporation tax compared with last year.</p> <p>The government had planned to eliminate the structural budget deficit by 2015 with a tough programme of spending cuts and tax rises.</p> <p>It has eliminated a quarter of the deficit so far, though this figure is in line with Labour's pre-election target and not the more aggressive plans outlined by George Osborne in the summer of 2010.</p> <p>Osborne has failed to meet his own targets and his tougher austerity programme and the weak economy have forced him to extend the planned fiscal consolidation by another two years. David Cameron has warned austerity could last until 2020.</p> <p>A Treasury spokesman blamed a cut in North Sea oil production for the bulk of the fall in corporation tax receipts. He said it was expected that government spending would increase in response to the \"weakening global economy\" and higher welfare spending, but it was still too early in the financial year to draw firm conclusions about the year as a whole.</p> <p>\"The government remains committed to the credible plan we have set out to deal with Britain's debts, and today's numbers emphasise how risky it would be to deliberately increase borrowing,\" he said.</p> <p>Manufacturers responding to the CBI's monthly industrial trends survey pointed to prolonged weakness in the economy. A balance of -21% of firms saying orders are falling compared with those saying orders are up represents the lowest return since the end of last year.</p> <p>The CBI said: \"Similarly, export orders have weakened with manufacturers reporting a balance of -17%. While still above the long-run average of -21%, this is the lowest figure reported since January 2012, when it reached -26%.\"Anna Leach of the CBI said: \"The economic environment for UK manufacturers remains challenging, with domestic demand relatively muted and the ongoing eurozone crisis now seeming to drag on broader global economic momentum.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the three years since the last series of Armando Iannucci's The Thick of It, the fine line dividing art and real life has become more gossamer-like than ever.</p> <p>The government's pasty tax U-turn, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2012/jul/27/jeremy-hunt-loses-bell-end\" title=\"\">Jeremy Hunt's unfortunate Olympic bell-ringing incident</a> and treasury minister <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bddWaHuxTzc\" title=\"\">Chloe Smith's Newsnight mauling by Jeremy Paxman</a> all suggested a master satirist at work.</p> <p>\"I always look at the news, unless it's something absolutely horrific, as entertainment,\" said one of The Thick of It's six principal scriptwriters, Roger Drew. \"Stuff in politics, the backbiting, the in-fighting, it's just hugely entertaining. Chloe Smith on Newsnight \u2013 that was terrific.\"</p> <p>The show's writing team keeps its distance from real-life politics \u2013 script consultant Kate Conway is their conduit with Westminster \u2013 although Iannucci was said to have been contacted by an insider from the office of deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg.</p> <p>\"Someone approached Armando and said, I am in Nick Clegg's office ... I will give you all the dirt. I don't know what happened with them,\" said Drew. \"People said the coalition was always going to break down, it's whether they managed to make it to the end of the five-year term. The jury's out on that.\"</p> <p>Times have changed, both in reality and in the fictional world of the Bafta-winning BBC2 satire. The hapless Nicola Murray MP, played by Rebecca Front, is now leader of the opposition, with Peter Capaldi's Alastair Campbell-alike, Malcolm Tucker, temporarily neutered.</p> <p>A coalition government is in power, supported by a junior partner dubbed \"The Inbetweeners\" \u2013 as is the show's tradition, no party is ever identified by name \u2013 and Peter Mannion MP (any resemblance to Kenneth Clarke is entirely coincidental) in charge of the Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship.</p> <p>\"There is even more conflict and less possibility of anyone being happy at all,\" said Roger Allam, who plays Mannion.</p> <p>Producer Adam Tandy said the show, which returns to BBC2 in September, had sought to reflect the changing political times.</p> <p>\"It was a perfect opportunity to reboot and allows us to keep the show relevant and do different things with the characters. No one is in power, no one has won the election, and that is an inner truth which we have embraced wholeheartedly,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We aim to achieve certain parallels with real political life, but it's not slavish satire. We get lucky from time to time. Who was it had the bell come off the end of his stick? We couldn't have made that up and put it in a script and expect people to believe it.\"</p> <p>The new seven-part series is played out against the background of an inquiry inspired by Lord Justice Leveson's long-running probe into press ethics set up in the wake of the News of the World phone hacking scandal.</p> <p>Cast members and production team are coy about precise details of the \"inquiry\" and its fallout, but it is not specifically related to the media.</p> <p>\"The inquiry affects everybody in a particular way,\" said Front. \"You gradually see it unfolding, it is all quite unexpected. It starts to become apparent that everybody is embroiled. Armando is quite intrigued by the whole culture of inquiries.\"</p> <p>Iannucci returned to The Thick of It while finishing the first series of his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/apr/14/armando-iannucci-veep-hbo-show?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">White House satire, Veep, starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus</a>.</p> <p>\"When we were initially thinking about the series, before we knew we would spend a year on Veep, the [coalition] tensions were within each party, the problems were internal,\" said Will Smith, who writes and stars in The Thick of It. \"Luckily for us, comedically by the time we came to do it, it all seemed to be coming apart a bit more, there was more friction.\"</p> <p>But some real-life incidents \u2013 such as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/may/11/rebekah-brooks-david-cameron-texts-lol\" title=\"\">Leveson inquiry revelations that David Cameron signed his texts to Rebekah Brooks LOL</a>, until she pointed out that the phrase meant \"laugh out loud\", not \"lots of love\" \u2013 were too outlandish even for The Thick of It.</p> <p>\"It doesn't make us feel we have to match that,\" said Smith. \"Armando is always very keen to make it believable, to feel real.

  "<p>It had been a long time coming and there has been no shortage of pain along the way but after more than eight months of waiting Wolverhampton Wanderers finally won a league game in front of their own supporters. Stale Solbakken was frustrated to see Barnsley grab a late consolation through Tomasz Cywka but otherwise this was a satisfying evening for the new Wolves manager, as goals from Stephen Ward, Sylvan Ebanks-Blake and Dave Edwards got their Championship season up and running.</p> <p>It was only the second time that Wolves have tasted victory in the league in 26 matches, which provides a measure of how miserable life became for them in the Premier League last term. The Championship, on this evidence, should be a good deal more enjoyable. Apart from a few anxious moments in the closing stages, after Cywka drilled in Kelvin Etuhu's cut-back 11 minutes from time, Wolves looked a class above Barnsley and should have won more comfortably.</p> <p>With David Moyes, the Everton manager, looking on from the stands, possibly with a view to signing Kevin Doyle, who was on his radar in January, or seizing a chance to take a closer look at Matt Jarvis, Wolves played at a high tempo and never looked back from the moment that Ward gave them an eighth-minute lead. Tongo Doumbia, a Mali international on loan from Rennes, was full of powerful running in central midfield while Slawomir Peszko, another new arrival, made a promising full debut on the right.</p> <p>Ward's goal could not have been better timed and allowed Wolves to play with the sort of freedom that they were rarely afforded last year. The left-back broke forward after reading David Gonzalez's intentions to throw the ball out and exchanged passes with Ebanks-Blake before coolly shooting beyond the Barnsley goalkeeper.</p> <p>Doyle set up the second, astutely picking out Ebanks-Blake, who made the most of the space that opened up for him as Barnsley appealed in vain for offside. Wolves were cruising at that point and it was no surprise when they added a third, Peszko's right-wing centre imploring Edwards to head in from the edge of the six-yard box. Although Barnsley briefly threatened to make life difficult for Wolves when Cywka fizzed a low shot into the corner of the net, the home side held on and came close to adding a fourth through the substitute Bjorn Sigurdarson, whose header clipped the top of the crossbar.</p> <p>For Solbakken, whose temper got the better of him when he kicked a water bottle at the end \u2013 \"I just wanted to wake the physio up\" \u2013 this was a crucial result. \"I think when you have not won at home in 2012 and you have won something like one game in 27, it's all about one thing: getting three points to give the players some confidence,\" the Norwegian said. \"The only thing that disturbed me a little bit was that we let in a stupid goal at the end.\"</p>",
  "<p>Brian McDermott experienced a sense of deja vu when he saw Eden Hazard tormenting the Wigan defence on Sunday. The Reading manager's mind drifted back to an afternoon spent in France five years ago, when he was employed as the Premier League club's chief scout and travelled to Lille to watch a teenager from Belgium produce a performance that had the talent spotters drooling.</p> <p>\"Hazard was 16 or 17 years of age and I thought he was phenomenal,\" recalled McDermott, whose Reading side make the short but rather daunting trip to Stamford Bridge to face Chelsea on Wednesday night. \"Everyone knew at 16 what a talent he was going to be. He is incredible. He goes down the side of people, he's got great feet and he can go either way with the ball. He was making his way back then but he stood out like a proverbial sore thumb.</p> <p>\"I saw [Marouane] Fellaini play in an Under-21 tournament and asked about trying to sign him for Reading at the time but I think he was about \u00a37m. He was another one, 17 years of age and he was terrific. These guys know they've got a special talent and Hazard was a special talent. But you can't go to a place like Lille and go: 'We'll take your best player.' It just doesn't happen.\"</p> <p>Chelsea did just that this summer, albeit after handing over a cheque for \u00a332m. It is a huge sum of money for a midfielder who is only 21, although the early signs are that Hazard, who came in for some rough treatment at Wigan, has the mental fortitude as well as the technical ability to be a success in the Premier League.</p> <p>\"He looks as though he's going to handle the physicality of the league no problem. He was excellent on Sunday,\" McDermott said. \"Going back to when I played, you could kick people out of the league because that's how it was in those days. But this day and age it's not like that, thank God. Make one tackle now and you get booked. In a way that's why the flair players in the league thrive now and I think that's a good thing.\"</p> <p>In an intriguing sub-plot to the Chelsea game both clubs will have Russian owners watching from the stands, with Anton Zingarevich, who took control at Reading in May, coming face to face with Roman Abramovich. \"Anton absolutely loves his football,\" said McDermott, who will be picking from the same squad that drew with Stoke on the opening day. \"I know he wanted to play football as a youngster, he got involved in a game [during pre-season] with the staff and the press when we were in Portugal. He was desperate to play. He did all right, actually.\"</p> <p>Asked what position Zingarevich plays, McDermott replied: \"Anywhere he likes.\"</p>",
  "<p>Warwickshire took another step towards a first County Championship in eight years on the first day at Edgbaston, bowling Middlesex out on a true pitch for an under-par 287. Varun Chopra and Ian Westwood then added 21 unproblematic runs for the home side before a heavy shower brought play to an early close with 16 overs remaining.</p> <p>At the heart of Warwickshire's efforts was a debutant brought in on loan last week from Durham. In the era of the streamlined, gym-frequenting cricketer, Ian Blackwell's rotund silhouette is something of a professional anomaly.</p> <p>Nevertheless the 34-year-old remains a skilful spinner and would certainly have entered the game in confident mood having taken career-best figures of seven for 52 against Australia A just over a fortnight ago. It was his spell of 16.2-4-47-4 either side of the tea interval that first wrested control for Warwickshire, then gave them the ascendency.</p> <p>Middlesex would have been content with the opening skirmishes as they moved untroubled to 39 without loss in the ninth over. However, as the sun broke through, the ball started to swing a little and this lateral movement proved the undoing of the leading run-scorer Chris Rogers, pouched at the second attempt at second slip as he pushed loosely at Keith Barker.</p> <p>Joe Denly and Dawid Malan soon followed, the latter courtesy of the first of two brilliant one-handed legside catches by the Warwickshire wicketkeeper Tim Ambrose, and at 48 for three the home side scented blood.</p> <p>However, Neil Dexter and Sam Robson \u2013 who would both make season's best scores \u2013 then added a better-than-a run-a-ball 73, the latter moving to a half-century from 62 deliveries before he was undone by Boyd Rankin's decidedly awkward bounce and Ambrose's glovework for 60.</p> <p>Dexter was less convincing, moving from 10 to 30 with five streaky boundaries, all squirted through, or over, the gully region, then taking three more from consecutive Chris Wright deliveries despite the presence of a man there, a move that raised an ironic cheer from the home crowd. But the truth is Warwickshire offered him too much width, too often.</p> <p>Even so, the glut of boundaries \u2013 21 from the 28 overs before lunch \u2013 was as much a testament to an excellent pitch that offered plenty of carry for those prepared to bend their backs. With the 200 coming up in the 40th over, it was Blackwell who turned the tide. While his figures undoubtedly flattered him more than his new sleeveless jumper \u2013 Adam Rossington's dismissal, a spooned cut from a long-hop that gripped, was particularly ghastly \u2013 his new teammates will have been grateful for his controlling contribution.</p> <p>A double breakthrough from the inconsistent yet dangerous Rankin in the first over after tea, including Dexter for 101 from 142 balls, completed Middlesex's demise from a decent mid-afternoon position of 216 for four. They have much ground to claw back.</p>",
  "<p>Foxconn, Apple's top manufacturer, has improved safety conditions and cut working hours in an effort to resolve violations at its plants that triggered a global scandal for the iPad and iPhone maker.</p> <p>The Taiwanese company submitted to an audit by an independent group, the Fair Labor Association (FLA), after reports of suicides and abusive conditions at several of its factories in China.</p> <p>Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, asked the FLA to investigate after a series of reports into working conditions at Apple's key supplier. In February and march the FLA found at least 50 violations of local regulations at Foxconn plants in Chengdu, Guanlan and Longhua.</p> <p>The FLA said Foxconn had made significant improvements such as introducing more breaks and better maintenance of safety equipment. The company more than doubled wages after protests from worker groups and is backing a local law adjustment that will extend unemployment insurance.</p> <p>Foxconn had completed all the 195 actions that were due at the time of the FLA's report and another 89 action items were completed ahead of their deadline, according to the FLA. Another 76 actions are due over the course of the next year.</p> <p>But the FLA said Foxconn faces more challenges in the coming months. Foxconn has reduced hours to under 60 per week including overtime and is aiming to reach full compliance with the Chinese legal limit of 40 hours per week plus an average of nine hours of overtime per week.</p> <p>\"The next phase of improvements will be challenging for Foxconn because they involve major changes in the working environment that will inevitably cause uncertainty and anxiety among workers. As Foxconn prepares to comply with the Chinese legal limits on work hours, consultation with workers on the changes and implications will be critical to a successful transition,\" said FLA president Auret van Heerden.</p> <p>Foxconn is the world's biggest electronics contract manufacturer. As well as being Apple's largest supplier Foxconn, which employs about a million people, makes products for Sony, Hewlett-Packard, Cisco Systems and others.</p> <p>Criticism of the company has been mounting for years. In 2009 a 25-year-old worker committed suicide, reportedly after losing an iPhone prototype. After a spate of suicides Foxconn installed nets around the edges of some buildings to prevent people jumping off roofs.</p> <p>In January following a New York Times article that documented problems inside its supplier factories Cook emailed staff worldwide to say: \"we care about every worker in our worldwide supply chain. Any accident is deeply troubling, and any issue with working conditions is cause for concern. Any suggestion that we don't care is patently false and offensive to us.\"</p>",
  "<p>Can Prince Philip perhaps be forgiven a little? For being such a rude bugger, and not always saying the right thing? No, no excuses?</p> <p>But he did have a difficult childhood, as we learn in <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-queens-mother-in-law\" title=\"\"><strong>The Queen's Mother in Law</strong></a> (Channel 4). Philip's mum, Alice of Battenberg, was a bit German and a bit British (Queen Victoria was her great grandmother) and she married Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark (lord knows why they came as a package). It was different in those days \u2013 there was no Mahiki or wherever they now go to meet potential partners, so the royal houses of Europe paired off among each other, even though they were all cousins. And because they were so inbred they were too stupid to get into St Andrews University so they couldn't meet fit commoners/non-rellies that way. It was a difficult cycle to break out of. Alice, incidentally, was congenitally deaf.</p> <p>Anyway, after the Greco-Turkish war, Andrew and Alice were kicked out of Greece with their five children \u2013 four girls, who would marry Germans who later served under Hitler in the second world war. And Phil the Greek, who served in the British navy, before copping off with our Brenda. Oh, and Alice was back in occupied Greece during the war, rescuing Jews from the Nazis, a kind of mini-Schindler, albeit with a much shorter list. Complicated huh? Like one of those Liverpool families that is half red, half blue \u2013 possibly even more complicated.</p> <p>That's jumping the gun, though. Because first Alice has to go mad. Which she did with gusto and aplomb. She thought she was having sexual relationships not just with Jesus Christ but with Buddha too. Husband Prince Andrew (of Greece and Denmark, keep up), unprepared to share his missus with the founders of any major world religions \u2013 and also because he's a bit of a cad, to be honest \u2013 legged it to the French Riviera for a lazy life of sunshine and mistresses. And Alice \u2013 on the instructions of her mother \u2013 was locked up in an asylum. Here, on the recommendation of Sigmund Freud, she had her ovaries X-rayed, because they thought that accelerating the menopause would cure her. These same people were also transplanting the testicles of gay men, in order to cure them of their gayness. Bloody idiots.</p> <p>Back to poor Philip then. He came home from a picnic one day to find that his deluded mum had been locked away, and his dad had skedaddled. So he was sent to boarding school in England, and was passed around among aristocratic rellies in the holidays, before joining the navy to fight against the Nazis who were married to his sisters. Then he met the future Queen of England, his future wife (and third cousin).</p> <p>They were reunited later, Philip and his mother. Alice, now a nun and (marginally) less mad, came to live in Buckingham Palace, where she wandered the corridors, sucking on a Woodbine. \"Wonderful, isn't it?\" says Giles Brandreth. It is, yes, all of it, an amazing story. Also wonderful are all the old trouts who come out from under their rocks to talk about it. Not just Giles, but also Countess Mountbatten, Lady Pamela So-and-So etc. Lovely.</p> <p>It's a shame that Jack Whitehall has thrown everything at his own character in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00vrlrh\" title=\"\"><strong>Bad Education</strong></a> (BBC3), and more or less forgotten about everyone else. Michelle Gomez, star of Green Wing and such a hilarious physical comic actor, is unforgivably underused. I'd also like to see more of some of the kids who are brilliant \u2013 Chantelle the slag, camp Stephen, Grayson the bully (love the way he says \"shut up\"). That would give it more layers, more depth. It's all Jack's Alfie though. I guess that's what happens when the writer is also the star. Me me me me me.</p> <p>BUT \u2013 and it's a big, upper-case but \u2013 Bad Education is still fabulous, a very silly half-hour of anarchic inappropriate joy. With some lovely situations, and some lovely lines. \"Make a noise, like a girl having a crap,\" teacher Alfie orders pupil Joe, cowering in the girls' toilets, when the deputy goes into the next cubicle to empty a confiscated bottle of cider.</p> <p>Crucially, and probably because it's the creation of one guy, Bad Education has heaps of personality. It may be a flawed baby, but it's Whitehall's baby.</p> <p>The other new school-based sitcom, <a href=\"http://skyliving.sky.com/gates/sneak-peek-gates-episode-1-preview-video\" title=\"\"><strong>Gates</strong></a> (Sky Living) is the creation of five people. I know that can work with slick American shows, but this isn't one of them. It feels like comedy by committee, where compromises have been reached, and middle paths found. The result is it has almost zero personality. It's not awful, it's just a bit bland. Not joyous, not anarchic, not funny.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 22 August 2012 because an editing error led to Battenberg being misspelled as Battenburg. It was further amended on 24 August 2012 because the footnote appended on 22 August 2012 erred in saying that the original article had referred to Gordonstoun as a boarding school in England. In fact the original article referred only to Prince Philip being sent to boarding school in England.

Or to be more specific, thank God for Cindy McCain's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CindyhM1/status/237646252890800128\">tweet of yesterday</a>: \"Rape is rape Mr Akin.\"</p> <p>You'd think all women would be clear on the issue of sexual assault.</p> <p>But it's not that simple. I've been wondering over the past 24 hours where the other women of the GOP stand on rape. There are vast numbers of them in the Republican Party (and the Tea Party) after all. </p> <p>This morning when CNN reported that the draft language of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/21/republican-party-abortion-ban-endorsement\">Republican platform includes a constitutional ban on abortion</a> \u2013 with no exception mentioned for rape \u2013 I thought it's easy to blame all of this \"anti-rape nonsense\" on a patriarchal party. But the fact is a heavy blame-the-victim bias still exists in all cultures. And what none of us wants to admit is that much of that blame continues to emanate from women.</p> <p>At some point in our lives, most women will have some kind of sexual experience that leaves us feeling uneasy, vulnerable, powerless \u2013 and ashamed. It might be what the Republicans have been calling \"forcible rape\", it might be an unwanted grope. It can be anything that we don't want to happen that we can't stop. You know what I'm talking about. If you're old enough to be reading this, chances are it's already happened to you in some form.</p> <p>If it has, let me ask you, what did you do about it? Nothing? That's what most of us do. It's the easiest way to make it go away, we think. We tell ourselves it could have been worse as we try to go about our lives. And in doing so we blame ourselves to some degree. It's a short step from blaming ourselves to blaming all victims. But that step takes us from \"rape is rape\" to \"rape \u2013 well, maybe \u2026\"</p> <p>I've heard women I like and respect on every other issue sound completely insane on this topic. \"What was she doing out after dark?\" \"Why did she get into a cab with him/them?\" \"Why was she drinking/her skirt so short?\" \"She has a bad reputation anyway.\"</p> <p>I've also heard women criticize other women for reporting incidents, for \"making a fuss\", instead of assuming the passive position after the event. This might explain why the department of justice continues to say that less than half of sexual assaults are taken to the authorities.</p> <p>Why are we so harsh? Why so judgmental? Experts say women do this to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/feb/19/blame-the-rapist\">reassure themselves</a> that sexual assault won't happen to them.</p> <p>But we know that's not the case. If anything like this has ever happened to you, and you feel guilty and ashamed, you probably also feel enraged. If so, good. But direct your fury in the right direction. Judge the right person. And be kind to the woman who needs it.</p> <p>The November presidential election looks to be heading to be as much about women's rights as the economy. Women outnumber men in both the general population and the electorate. We can no longer blame an outmoded way of thinking on the patriarchy. These are OUR parties. This is OUR issue. Let's take control of it.</p>",
  "<p>Roberto Di Matteo can rest assured that Josh McEachran is in good company at Middlesbrough. While the Chelsea loanee impressed on his first start for Tony Mowbray's team, two fellow teenagers wearing home colours refused to be upstaged.</p> <p>Adam Reach and Luke Williams may be relative unknowns outside Teesside, but the two academy graduates and England Under-19 internationals put in eye-catching second performances, in the process earning Boro a deserved first win of the season against a strong Burnley side.</p> <p>Still only 34-years-old, Burnley's Eddie Howe is regarded as one of the game's brightest young managers and, in beating newly relegated Bolton last Saturday, his side had made a promising start to the new season.</p> <p>They opened well here, too. Indeed, Howe's team would have been ahead in short order had the unmarked Ross Wallace not shot wide from an inviting position after a slick passing move that involved Chris McCann, who prised open a home defence marshalled by the returning Jonathan Woodgate.</p> <p>In front of Woodgate, on the right of Tony Mowbray's midfield, McEachran made his home debut after joining on a season-long loan from Chelsea. Long hyped as one of England's most exciting talents, he swiftly displayed some neat left-foot touches, betraying little of the ring-rust that might have been expected from a young man who struggled on loan at Swansea last season and had not played a first-team game for five months.</p> <p>All the early indications are that McEachran will help Mowbray achieve his ambition of making Boro a more comfortable side in control of the ball, as opposed to last season's proficient, if limited, counter-attacking unit that tended to cede possession for prolonged periods.</p> <p>Boro's goalkeeper Jason Steele was required to save a 20-yard Sam Vokes shot and Emmanuel Ledesma \u2013 one of several new Boro new boys signed with technical ability in mind \u2013 curled a free kick fractionally wide. Generally, however, chances were limited.</p> <p>Or at least they were until the 40th minute when Woodgate and friends had no answer to Kieran Trippier's cross and Steele proved powerless to keep Charlie Austin's header out. Forty eight seconds later, Mowbray's players were level, as Curtis Main flicked the ball on to Nicky Bailey, who directed a low shot into the bottom corner from just outside the area.</p> <p>Like McEachran, Reach is 19, but he belied his inexperience by directing a second half volley beyond Lee Grant. Back came Burnley, Junior Stanislas equalising after Rhys Williams had scrambled the ball off the line.</p> <p>The home crowd were resigned to disappointment when, four minutes after stepping off the bench, substitute Williams, another youth product, sent away another half volley, this time from at least 30 yards, that arced towards the top corner to win it for Boro in the 88th minute.</p>",
  "<p>Reading's promotion under the new ownership of Anton Zingarevich has meant that this season a majority, 11 of the 20 Premier League clubs, are owned by overseas individuals, with several, such as \"the Royals\", now held ultimately in tax havens. Reading, formed in 1871 at a public meeting in the town's Bridge Street Rooms, are owned by Anton, the 30-year old son of the St Petersburg-based pulp and paper billionaire Boris Zingarevich, via Thames Sports Investments (TSI), registered in Gibraltar.</p> <p>Siting the shares of companies, including football clubs, in offshore locations such as Gibraltar or the Cayman Islands (the Glazer family's newly registered base for Manchester United) means owners avoid UK capital gains tax and stamp duty, when they sell the shares at a profit in the future. Such havens also offer to investors a guarantee of secrecy, about who owns or is involved in companies registered in them. John Christensen, a director of Tax Justice Network, which campaigns against the vast draining of money from tax-paying countries such as Britain, says tax havens should more justifiably be known as \"secrecy jurisdictions\".</p> <p>The key figure at Reading in enabling the sale by the outgoing owner, Sir John Madejski, to Zingarevich, agreed in January and finally approved by the Football and Premier Leagues in May, was Christopher Samuelson, a veteran manager of funds in offshore locations. Samuelson is a director of Mutual Trust SA, an investment firm based in Switzerland, which also operates a low tax regime and long tradition of secrecy about banking and financial ownership. On its website,, undergoing reconstruction, Mutual Trust carried the assurance: \"Our challenge is to provide our clients with their fundamental rights to privacy of their information and to protect their assets from attack and confiscation \u2026 We will not use jurisdictions that do not respect and uphold the fundamental right of clients of confidentiality. Your information is safe in our hands, for always.\"</p> <p>Given the intense scrutiny as the game's profile has soared, and the clubs' continuing claims to be at the heart of their local communities, more information about ownership is now revealed than about companies operating less in the public eye. Madejski, who made his own fortune in printing and with the Auto Trader second-hand car catalogue, had long been looking to remove himself from the financial burden of owning a club whose new stadium he built 14 years ago. In the year to June 30 2011, the latest for which accounts are available, Reading made a \u00a35m loss in the Championship and Madejski had personally loaned the club \u00a326m.</p> <p>Samuelson was approached to see if he could find a buyer and finally he concluded a deal with echoes of the mooted one for Everton in 2004. Then, Anton Zingarevich, 21 at the time, was involved in talks to take over the club, with the money to come from a fund managed by Samuelson based in Brunei. Boris Zingarevich, an industrialist who his representatives say has built a paper company, Ilim, from scratch over 20 years, rather than becoming a billionaire through favourable state sales of assets, like Russia's oligarchs, said he was not interested in English football.</p> <p>This time Samuelson did deliver a deal to buy Reading, and both Madejski and Samuelson's TSI vehicle have been open about the terms of the deal. TSI bought 51% of the club for \u00a312.7m, and has an option to buy the other 49% for \u00a312.3m. That is \u00a325m to buy a well-run club with a new stadium, now in the Premier League. The deal was one in an increasing tendency for overseas buyers to target clubs in the Championship, where they pay less than for those in the Premier League, and aim to grasp a financial jackpot if they win promotion. Leicester City, bought by the owners of the King Power duty free franchise in Thailand; Cardiff City, owned by Malaysian investors, and Nottingham Forest, bought this summer by the Kuwaiti Al Hasawi family, are in the vanguard of that process.</p> <p>Madejski agreed his sale, at what many believe is a bargain price for the club he rebuilt, with Reading still in the Championship; he completed for the same figure despite Brian McDermott's side triumphantly claiming promotion, although Samuelson has said Madejski was paid a \u00a35m bonus.</p> <p>After sundry mishaps, collapses and scandals, both the Premier League and Football League have developed new rules and procedures before approving new owners, and the Football League led the four-month process at Reading. The requirements for owners and directors of clubs, formerly known as the \"fit and proper person test\", are that anybody on the board or owning more than 30% of a club must not have unspent criminal convictions for dishonesty, be bankrupt or have been involved in the insolvency of two football clubs since 2004. Both leagues now also require proof that the money is there, as committed, to buy the club, and to see a business plan which shows the club will be able to remain solvent and fulfil its fixtures for the season ahead. Both leagues now employ corporate intelligence companies to gather information, mostly from public sources and press coverage, about prospective owners. The Premier League also makes inquiries of the Home Office and Foreign Office to ask whether the government has relevant information about prospective owners.</p> <p>At Reading increased scrutiny was prompted by the collapse of Portsmouth, where the owner from 2005, Sacha Gaydamak, a Russian in his 20s, always denied his billionaire father, Arkady was involved or had provided the funds. Anton Zingarevich, who has repeatedly described owning Reading as \"a dream\", and pledged to run the club responsibly, has said the funds to pay Madejski came from \"family money\".</p> <p>Artem Savko, a spokesman for Ilim, Boris Zingarevich's pulp and paper firm, : \"Ilim has nothing to do with Reading, nor football,\" and a source close to Zingarevich said he has nothing to do with the Reading acquisition. Anton is understood to be involved on the construction side of his father's personal businesses, and not to work at Ilim in any capacity.</p> <p>Ultimately the Football League took the view that the millions for Anton to pay Madejski via Samuelson's Gibraltar vehicle could not wholly be separated from his billionaire father. So Boris Zingarevich, while not a director of the club or TSI, was required to certify his suitability under the owners and directors test, which applies to anybody who could be said to exercise \"control\" over a club. Samuelson, and Andrew Obolensky, a director of TSI, have also been certified.</p> <p>Samuelson's son John is the other director on the board of TSI. \"The Premier League's financial criteria seek to ensure responsible and sustainable ownership,\" a league spokesman said, explaining that it is examining whether further regulations are required. \"Each club's ownership model is compliant with UK company law.\"</p> <p>That is true. The clubs, as ever, reflect their times and country, in which so much is up for sale and use of offshore havens to avoid tax has become routine.</p> <p><em>david.conn@guardian.co.uk</em></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/21/nhs-brand-sold-overseas-hospitals\" title=\"\">This morning's news</a> that the government is setting up a body <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/21/nhs-brand-sold-overseas-hospitals\" title=\"\">to assist the NHS in attracting contracts overseas</a> has met with kneejerk opposition from those suspicious of anything that connects the NHS with the words \"brand\", \"compete\" and \"contract\". I don't blame them, but as scientists and doctors sometimes need to say to polemicists: it's a bit more complicated than that.</p> <p>For the \"NHS abroad\" brand to benefit patients in this country, the key question is, could the NHS generate enough profit to offset the set-up costs and the loss of NHS trained doctors and nurses going to work abroad? Chris Canning, a director of Moorfields Eye Hospital Dubai, has an answer to that question, but it's the wrong one. He said the new agency had been set up without any cost or risk to the NHS: \"We've put in our own money, the profits from our private wing \u2013 not a penny of taxpayers' money.\" Hang on, Chris, weren't those the very same profits that were supposed to be \"all reinvested in NHS care\" to justify the resources being put&#xa0;into the private wing?</p> <p>The biggest scandal is that the NHS may start setting up for-profit clinics in developing countries such as India, having denuded those countries of their precious medical and nursing staff by dint of successive governments failing to train enough of our own staff.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050629/debtext/50629-03.htm\" title=\"\">In 2005, I asked Tony Blair in Prime Minister's Questions</a> how he could justify deporting Aids patients back to Malawi when he was busy importing Aids doctors from that country. He coughed and spluttered so much I thought he would need urgent admission to any hospital bed, anywhere.</p> <p>At any rate, the real debate at this stage shouldn't be about NHS beds in India or Saudi Arabia, but about beds in&#xa0;the UK. The real scandal in our health&#xa0;service is the farce of \"NHS pay beds\", where beds in NHS hospitals are reserved not for patients with the biggest tumours but for those with the fattest wallets, not for those with acute infections but for those with solid insurance. This has been going on for decade despite obvious problems.</p> <p>The ethical dilemma of turning away urgent patients from an NHS hospital site that has empty beds reserved for less sick but more wealthy people is such that I don't believe it is morally acceptable to have pay-beds on the same site as emergency admissions.</p> <p>The case against pay beds in the NHS is even stronger when we see that the last government forced NHS hospitals to&#xa0;buy extra capacity for its patients at inflated prices from private hospitals and independent sector treatment centres, even though they had that capacity in their own hospital. Why couldn't they&#xa0;use it? Because it was reserved for private patients treated at lower prices than Bupa et al could offer.</p> <p>Despite amendments to the competition part of the coalition's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Social_Care_Act_2012\" title=\"\">Health and Social Care Act</a>, I fear it will ultimately be at the mercy of UK and European competition law. This is because successive governments have encouraged the NHS to compete for private patients. It&#xa0;is obvious to even the thickest law undergraduate that a competition judge is more likely to insist on granting private providers access to the \"NHS market\" (as designed and described by Thatcher, Blair, Brown and Cameron) when the NHS, with all its massive economies of scale, is strong-arming its way into the private patient market. The idea of an NHS hospital setting up a clinic or any other activity abroad is less problematic than private beds at home because these problems do not apply.</p> <p>But a major problem with NHS pay beds is the obvious opportunity cost, because those resources could be used to treat NHS patients who are more urgent. The original reason why pay beds were allowed in NHS hospitals was to keep consultants in the same building as&#xa0;their NHS patients. This was in the days before job contracts and indeed the&#xa0;loyalty that almost all senior doctors&#xa0;working in the NHS now display. Private wards and wings are defended by each and every health secretary on the basis that \"all profits are reinvested in NHS care\". But while Canning suggests this is&#xa0;not at all the case, successive health secretaries have failed to show what those profits were. If they did exist, it was unclear whether they were large enough to compensate for the opportunity cost of not treating NHS patients in order of priority. I could find no general teaching hospital with published figures showing that NHS patients benefitted from pay beds.</p>",

  "<p>We agree with Dr Sarah Wollaston MP (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/17/assisted-suicide-causes-harm\" title=\"\">The harm in helping</a>, 18 August) on the importance of palliative care being delivered in people's homes, and on the need to make it straightforward for people to make decisions about their end-of-life treatment. However, we cannot agree with her that suffering at the end of life must be endured by some in order to protect others.</p> <p>Firstly, other jurisdictions in Europe and the US have legalised and regulated some form of assistance to die. While their laws differ in criteria and safeguards, none have been visited by the dire predictions that Dr Wollaston makes. Trust has not broken down between doctors and patients; there is no duty to die; and assisted deaths remain a small proportion of overall deaths. Dr Wollaston fails to set out why Britain would be different.</p> <p>Secondly, while convenient to polarise the debate between autonomy on the one hand and greater protection on the other, informed decision-making actually allows for both. At present the law attempts to protect people by examining, and nearly always forgiving, the motives of loved ones who have helped someone to die. People would be better protected if the law allowed healthcare professionals to thoroughly examine the motives and decision-making capacity of a person who wishes to die, when they are still alive, and so ensure they are aware of all their care and treatment options.</p> <p>Patient choice and patient safety at the end of life are not mutually exclusive.

As she rightly says, \"doctors do not always get it right\", and yet, having made a very thoughtful and compassionate case for not changing the law on assisted dying, she still seems to be deciding for other people, patients and doctors, what is right or wrong for them.</p> <p>Keir Starmer's prosecution guidelines, while being \"humane and sensible\", are still heavily weighted against dying patients getting the advice and professional help they need to die with dignity.</p> <p>It is not for us doctors to decide what is right or wrong for others but for the general public through parliamentary debate to lay down guidelines for us all to work with.<br><strong>Robert MacGibbon</strong><br><em>(Retired GP), London</em></p> <p>\u2022 \"Making assisted dying legal would alter the way society weighs the value of human life for ever,\" writes Sarah Wollaston. Might not assisted dying cause us to reassess the value of human life for the better? Are we to accept that going through depression, hopelessness, pain and exhaustion is a normal part of a human life, for ever? Once it becomes clearer how valuable a healthy human life is, perhaps more action might become possible against the various factors in our society which are detrimental to a healthy human life.

  "<p>The captaincy of England appears to have a natural cycle. Let us call it the 'Smith cycle', for once every four years, so it seems, the captain of South Africa, the man who was given the job of clearing up the mess left by Hansie Cronje, visits England and kills off his counterpart \u2013 whoever it might be.</p> <p>It happened to two of England's finest in Nasser Hussain and Michael Vaughan, \u2013 both of them experienced and tough as a pair of Ken Higgs' bowling boots. And for a time, this past month or so, it looked as if the assassin was going to manage it again.</p> <p>This time it will not happen, though. Or at least one hopes that is the case.</p> <p>Andrew Strauss, beaten and bitterly disappointed at the manner in which his England side have failed to defend their No1 status in the year they have held it, has taken himself and his family off for a break, away from it all, and there is no question that he has earned it.</p> <p>Taking on what has been shown to be the best team in the world is an onerous task in itself and would require everyone, but particularly the captain, to be on the top of his game. But he has been wearied, not just by the mental demands of the cricket played at the highest level but the continual fall-out from the Kevin Pietersen saga that has been bubbling under for a while and which finally erupted in the past week or so.</p> <p>Only Strauss and Andy Flower fully know how draining it has been, for only they are in possession of all the facts. Certainly no one on the periphery and beyond has any conception of the degree of enmity that has finally emerged. It is no exaggeration to say that men with less fortitude than the captain and coach might with good reason have wondered about their health.</p> <p>In the quiet of his break, though, Strauss may come to realise, if he does not already do so, that there is no disgrace in losing a series to a team so well equipped as the tourists. Had the teams both played at the peak of their powers, then it would have been a scrap and a half but South Africa would still probably have taken the honours.</p> <p>The pity is that, with the appetite so whetted by the nature of the contests in the second and third Tests, there cannot be a soul who, entranced, watched the final day at Lord's and does not wish that there were still two matches to come. And Strauss will realise, if he catches the mood of his team, that he still has work to do. Losing the status is a bitter pill to swallow but it does lend the incentive of starting now on the quest to regain it. This is a baton that may well be passed around a few times over the coming years.</p> <p>Strauss will remain very much part of Flower's plans, his captaincy not an issue (those who query tactical nous should realise that the best captains make executive decisions on the back of solid advice and the worst ones act unilaterally) and the only concern his batting.</p> <p>Banish the thought that in sending texts Pietersen allegedly told the South Africans something that was not already common knowledge. Simon Hughes even wrote an entire magazine piece on the subject before the series. The bowlers played him beautifully and a mere 117 runs in the series was the result. In fact, he is probably a better batsman technically than he was four years ago \u2013 look at how he drives down the ground now, for instance \u2013 and it is the mental side that requires attention, the capacity to build on the starts that he invariably seems to get.</p> <p>He must take the side to India but whether he survives beyond that series is another matter.</p> <p>Perhaps the most significant of the failures of the England team among the successes has been an inability to come to terms with the demands of the slow, spinning pitches of the subcontinent, Sri Lanka and the Middle East \u2013 as evidenced most starkly early in the year in the Emirates when they were sent spinning by Saeed Ajmal and Abdur Rehman.</p> <p>No batsman came to terms with it, not even Pietersen, whose majestic match- winning innings later on in Colombo cannot mask his shortcomings there. But, if he is not to go to India, then some need at least to take a leaf from his book, to play less passively and to rely less on the sweep (the DRS system will not be used in the series but this does not mean that umpires will not have a DRS mind-set and there will be no challenges to that).</p> <p>It would help the batsmen if they noted how the South African batsmen coped with Graeme Swann, who bowled well enough and thriftily, but managed only four wickets in 122 overs, given that Harbhajan Singh appears to be re-emerging as a threat.</p> <p>The right-handers, all of them, played Swann from on or outside offstump and worked the legside. The left-handers, most notably Smith, on the other hand, made DRS redundant by playing the ball with the bat and keeping pad out of the way. For most of his overs Swann hardly cleared his throat.</p> <p>Only at Lord's, where England came up with a restrictive field placing that forced Smith into sweeping as a means of getting himself moving, did Swann gain control of the South African captain.</p> <p>India may see the rehabilitation of Strauss and the rejuvenation of his team as a threat once more. If that is the case, expect Strauss to take England through the Ashes campaigns.

Russian forces \u2013 Tsarist, Bolshevik, and post-Soviet \u2013 have been fighting in the North Caucasus for the best part of three centuries, and the conflict stubbornly refuses any attempt by the Kremlin to declare its mission there accomplished. What confidence can anyone have that the civil war in Syria, a land just as riven with old scores and ancient rivalries, will reach a definitive conclusion \u2013 the ousting of Bashar al-Assad and the establishment of a government committed to free elections, reconciliation and reconstruction? At the moment, very little.</p> <p>The battle taking place in Aleppo is a case in point. Syria's second city is key and by general consent will, in theory, provide the tipping point so desperately sought in a conflict that has already claimed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/22/syria-death-toll-tops-19000\" title=\"\">over 19,000 lives</a>. In practice this is proving to be an elusive concept. The regime holds the west of the city, and the militias that comprise the Free Syrian Army the east. The regime has only committed troops to one front, Salaheddine district in the south-west, and is reluctant to throw in the rest of its infantry, opting to shell and bomb from the air. There are theories as to why there have been no serious attempts to recapture the city, one of them being the fear of defections if units became detached from their officers. But in theory the eastern half of Aleppo, which is being contested by only 4,000 rebel fighters, should be relatively easy for a well-equipped army to retake.</p> <p>The fight from the rebels' perspective is not going well either. As they openly acknowledge, their presence is contested by much of the city's population. The fighters are not seen here as liberators, but as harbingers of terrible suffering to come. The FSA fall between two stools. They are ill equipped to shoot down Assad's warplanes, but eminently visible enough to attract the regime's aerial firepower. Assad's warplanes are also using bigger bombs in civilian areas. If this is a deliberate strategy by the regime that has strewn the city with craters, it may be working. Aleppines blame the FSA for military operations in their city, rather than Damascus for its brutal response. Whatever the cause, the rebels are by their own admission not getting the support in the city that they got in the countryside. This is not just a function of the demography of Aleppo. Support for the FSA in Damascus also depends on whether the insurgents are local. This may change, and could be more a result of the Balkanisation of Syrian society than the product of any lingering sympathy for Assad, which surely has evaporated. If the space for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/pawns-syrian-conflict-await-endgame?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">non-violent protest</a> has shrunk \u2013 although there are still opposition groups who cling on to this hope \u2013 the road ahead for the armed revolt can only be long and bitter. Despite high-level defections and the deaths of four senior security figures in a bombing last month, Assad's army is intact and he retains no shortage of options.</p> <p>One of them is to make <a href=\"http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/?p=15649&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Syriacomment+%28Syria+Comment%29\" title=\"\">a Lebanon out of Syria</a>. Assad has withdrawn his forces from Kurdish parts of Syria, and Turkey claims he has invited the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) back in. Turkey blamed a car bomb attack on a police station near its south-eastern border on the PKK and Syrian intelligence. Another sign of things to come is the bombing in <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/human-rights-watch/syria-fighter-jet-bombing_b_1789220.html\" title=\"\">Azaz</a>, only kilometres from the border, which killed 40 civilians. Assad is doing his utmost to provoke a Turkish incursion. Gun battles have broken out between rival groups in Tripoli, Lebanon's second city, as fears of contagion grow. The possibilities of exporting chaos are legion, and that is before Iran's Revolutionary Guards or Hezbollah, the two most powerful foreign forces in Assad's armoury, are deployed.</p> <p>One ethnic group fleeing the country is Syria's <a href=\"http://world.time.com/2012/08/21/circassians-flee-syria-strife-for-russia-homeland/\" title=\"\">Circassians</a>. They are part of a worldwide diaspora created when Russian troops expelled them from the North Caucasus, in what Circassians claim was a genocide. The world will be literally skiing on the graves of their forefathers in the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014. The date of their expulsion was 21 May 1864.</p>",
  "<p>Anyone in England and Wales with a dog out of control can now be jailed for six months. If&#xa0;the dog causes injury, the maximum term is to be two years. I have no sympathy for such people. Keeping these beasts is weird, and those who do it probably need treatment. But the Defra minister, <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/about/who/ministers/taylor/\" title=\"\">Lord Taylor of Holbeach</a>, complained in May that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9264919/More-dangerous-dog-owners-to-be-jailed-under-new-guidelines.html\" title=\"\">fewer than 20 people were in jail for dangerous dog offences</a>. The sentencing council has duly told courts to raise the threshold to two years, \"to send a message\".</p> <p>The same sentiment a year ago motivated magistrates to play to the gallery by<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/1292-jailed-after-riots-new-figures-show-7896198.html\" title=\"\"> jailing 1,292</a> people for stealing bottles of water or trainers or sending idiot incitements during the dispersed rampage dubbed \"urban riots\". Hysterical ministers raced home from holiday to tell judges to send messages. Judges duly ruined the lives of hundreds of young people, at great public expense and to no advantage to their victims. I have no sympathy for these people either, but again the politicised response to crime was disproportionate.</p> <p>A month before, a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-14150800\" title=\"\">London court jailed a stoned Charlie Gilmour</a> after he swung on a union flag from the Cenotaph and tossed a bin at a police car, thus causing widespread outrage in the offices of the Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail. The judge sent him down for 18 months to send a message carefully designed to wreck his university career. Yet again we need have no sympathy for Gilmour. But there is no such thing as a rap over the knuckles in jail. Judges know that any term in prison is a sentence for life.</p> <p>How can British politicians, whose statements clearly seek to influence pliable judges, criticise other sovereign states for doing likewise? Last week the Foreign Office professed itself \"deeply concerned\" at the fate of Russia's Pussy Riot three, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/17/pussy-riot-sentenced-two-years\" title=\"\">jailed for two years for \"hooliganism\"</a> in Moscow's Christ the Saviour Cathedral. They had staged what, by all accounts, was an obscene publicity stunt, videoing an anti-Putin song defamatory of the Virgin Mary in front of pious worshippers.</p> <p>Good for free speech, we might all say. That the act outraged public decency is an understatement. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2012/07/31/what-do-russians-think-about-pussy-riot-the-answer-might-surprise-you/\" title=\"\">In a Levada poll of Russian public opinion</a>, just 5% thought the girls should go unpunished and 65% wanted them in prison, 29% with hard labour. Artists round the globe may plead free speech, but to treat the Pussy Riot gesture as a glorious stand for artistic liberty is like praising Johnny Rotten, who did similar things, as the Voltaire of our day. There can be disproportionate apologias as well as disproportionate sentences.</p> <p>Artists can look after their own. For the British and US governments to get on high horses about Russian sentencing is hypocrisy. America and Britain damned the \"disproportionate\" Pussy Riot terms. In America's case this was from a nation that jails drug offenders for 20, 30 or 40 years, holds terrorism \"suspects\" incommunicado indefinitely and imprisons for life even trivial \"three strikes\" offenders. Last week alone a US military court declared that reporting the Guant\u00e1namo Bay trial of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/khalid-sheikh-mohammed\" title=\"\">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> would be censored. Any mention of his torture in prison was banned as \"reasonably expected to damage national security\". This has no apparent connection to proportionate punishment or freedom of speech.</p> <p>The British security establishment during the Tony Blair-Gordon Brown regime tried to censor history books for possible \"terrorist\" incitement. It introduced control orders, restricted courts and long-period detention without trial. It made unlicensed demonstrating an offence and has since sought prosecution of Twitter and Facebook abuse. British ministers and courts are craven to what passes for public opinion. The idea that, whenever a crime or antisocial action hits the headlines, \"the courts must send a message\" is politicised justice. At times, especially in tragic cases involving children, it gets near to a lynch mob. Again the only message sent is to the media. If Britain's draconian sentencing were effective, British jails would not be bursting at the seams.</p> <p>There is of course a difference between the liberties enjoyed in most western democracies and the cruder jurisprudence of modern Russia, China and much of the Muslim world. It would be silly to pretend otherwise. But the difference is not so great as to merit the barrage of megaphone comment from west to east. Pussy Riot may have attacked no one physically, but no society, certainly not Britain, legislates on the basis that \"words can never hurt\". If a rock group invaded Westminster Abbey and gravely insulted a religious or ethnic minority before the high altar, we all know that ministers would howl for \"exemplary punishment\" and judges would oblige.</p> <p>Commenting on the social mores of other countries may offer an offshore outlet for the righteous indignation of politicians and editorialists. It has no noticeable effect. Western comments on the treatment of women in Muslim states, dissidents in China or drug offenders in south-east Asia are dismissed as imperial interference. But then how would we feel if Moscow or Singapore or Tehran condemned the treatment of Cenotaph protesters?</p> <p>British courts jail at the drop of a headline. One of the few cabinet ministers in recent years to show a sincere desire to relate punishment to crime and imprisonment to consequence is the justice secretary, Kenneth Clarke. He is now being bad-mouthed out of his job by Downing Street's dark arts, frightened not of Clarke but of the rightwing press. Clarke is, with Iain Duncan Smith, a rare minister intellectually engaged with his job and eager courageously to see it through. Why are the Lib Dems not defending him? For David Cameron to sack Clarke would indeed send a message. Of the worst sort.</p>",
  "<p>'Just don't be in the toilet when we dive deep,\" executive officer David \"Bing\" Crosby advises me. \"The bulkheads bend and you can't open the doors.\" Forget all the technical stuff about monitoring \"the Bubble\" when you dive \u2013 I never quite understand the role of that mysterious piece of equipment \u2013 this is&#xa0;the kind of practical guidance I need. I vow to stick close to Bing, second-in-command on the nuclear submarine <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Triumph_(S93)\" title=\"\">HMS Triumph</a>, and a funny, down-to-earth bloke. \"It's like having children,\" he says as the younger officers grapple for space at the first morning briefing I&#xa0;attend. \"I've got children, and sometimes I think they're worse.\" This seems to be meant affectionately.</p> <p>I have been on the boat \u2013 submarines are always called boats, never ships \u2013 for less than 24 hours and am writing this log at a depth of 60m. Sorry, I spoke too soon. We are just rising to periscope depth \u2013 18m below the surface \u2013 and the tall desk on which I am typing has started to list. At least I'm not in the toilet. I joined HMS Triumph in Crete for the final week of its 10-month deployment. I had never been on a submarine before and don't especially like confined spaces. I plan to get off at Gibraltar six days from now, though the captain warns me this may not be possible if there is fog as the launch can't come alongside.</p> <p>HMS Triumph distinguished itself last year in Libya, firing missiles at Gaddafi's key installations, including the one which hit the colonel's compound. The submarine's captain, Robert Dunn, feels they have been largely written out of the Libyan campaign and is keen his crew get their due. \"If it be a sin to covet honour, I am the most offending soul alive,\" he tells me over breakfast, quoting Henry V. \"Faint hearts never fucked a pig\" is another of his maxims, which may be a translation from Clausewitz's On War. The book sits on a&#xa0;narrow shelf in his small cabin beside the control room.</p> <p>This is Capt Dunn's final command; in fact his very last week at sea. At 48, and after three years in charge of HMS Triumph, he will be getting a desk job. It is also Chief Petty Officer Simon Johnson's final week at sea. There is a nice moment during my week aboard when the submarine (never sub, an egregious Americanism) has to surface to pass through the Straits of Messina. We go through at sunrise and Chief Johnson, who is up on the bridge, tells me it's the first time he has sailed past Stromboli since he was on the frigate HMS Leander at the start of his naval career 30 years ago. The volcano has bookended his life at sea.</p> <p>I ask Chief Johnson why he switched from surface ships to submarines. \"I got drafted in 1983 and didn't have any choice,\" he says. \"I tried to get out of it. I didn't want to be a submariner. If you ask a general service chap what they think about submarines, they'll say: 'Horrible, dirty, noisy, you can't have a shower, you're always stinking.' Well, in the old days that might have been the case \u2013 water was very restricted \u2013 but you can see yourself; conditions are not that bad. On my first boat, Spartan, at the back end of 1983, it all clicked \u2013 it was a completely different way of life from general service.\"</p> <p>He goes on to cite what most submariners say is what they like about life beneath the waves: the relative informality. There are, of course, distinctions between officers and ranks, but in so confined a space nothing like the rigidities of surface ships; the sense of being an elite, what one able seaman calls a \"brotherhood\"; the camaraderie that comes from knowing they rely entirely on each other. When a man, whether officer or rating, becomes a submariner, he is awarded a badge formed from two dolphins and a crown. The badge admits you to an exclusive club \u2013 there are around 3,500&#xa0;operational submariners in the UK. It means that, in the event of an emergency, you will be a help, rather than a hindrance. Until then, in the uncompromising language of submariners, you are an \"oxygen thief\".</p> <p>\"Everyone who wears the dolphins badge has a common ethos, common training and a common focus,\" says Lieutenant Stuart Keillor, an impressive 31-year-old Scot who will one day command a submarine. \"No one does this job unless they want to. There's a lot of willpower in putting yourself into this environment for a long period. There's a lot of loyalty; and for that reason I'm very comfortable with my shipmates. There's a high expectation of the trainees that come on here. They've got a lot to prove, but once they're in the club, you&#xa0;can be confident they've reached a&#xa0;certain standard.\"</p> <p>I know I will never be in the club. Climbing the ladders between decks exhausts me; I am forever hitting my head on protruding bits of metal; and once in the control room, while leaning against the periscope, I stumble backwards and accidentally press a button. Luckily, it is the button that says \"search\" and not the one next to it that says \"attack\". I don't want to be responsible for a missile assault on Algeria, to which we happen to be close at the time.</p> <p>The submarine is two separate worlds: the front half, where the men (and at the moment it is all men, though there are likely to be female submariners from next year) sleep and eat and make war; and the back half, where the nuclear reactor sits beneath the tunnel that separates for'ard from back'aft and where the engines are. I don't spent much time back'aft, but I do visit for a back'afties' treat \u2013 potatoes baked on the engine throttle. At a crude level, a submarine crew is divided into those who make war and those who make the engines work. \"We push, they fight,\" as one back'aftie explains succinctly.</p> <p>The engineers call the nuclear reactor \"the big kettle\". It is what enables one of these fast-attack submarines to go on long operations, with no need to come into port for refuelling. Having it on board is a huge responsibility, as HMS Triumph's marine engineering officer, Lieutenant Commander Andy Sharp, makes clear. \"It's never going to explode,\" he says when I ask him what's the worst thing that could happen, \"but it could melt. If a nuclear submarine had an accident that caused it to have a slump and melt and drop out the bottom of the boat, I don't think we'd have a nuclear fleet any more. That would be the end of nuclear submarines. It's that level of responsibility.\" That pressure is enormous, but it works: to its credit, the navy has managed, over half a century, to run a fleet of submarines without a major incident.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395503415\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/21/1345564538828/HMS-Triumphs-cramped-cond-010.jpg\" alt=\"HMS Triumph's cramped conditions\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">HMS Triumph's cramped conditions add to the claustrophia. Photograph: Gary Calton for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A key distinction to grasp is between fast-attack submarines such as HMS Triumph, which are armed with conventional cruise missiles (the UK has seven such boats in varying degrees of readiness), and the four nuclear-armed submarines, one of which is always on patrol, ready to unleash its Trident nuclear missiles if apocalypse beckons. The latter \u2013 called ballistic submarines or bombers \u2013 are, at 180m long, almost twice the size of Triumph, have bigger crews and are, according to the men who have served on them, deadly boring. \"Their job is to stay silent,\" says one petty officer. \"You have no contact with the outside world.\" The bombers stay at a constant depth, move very slowly and do everything to avoid detection. It is three months of suspended animation; 180 men aspiring to the life of a flat fish, though a highly educated one \u2013 many are doing Open University degrees to pass the time and improve themselves.</p> <p>Another man tells me the crew on board one bomber used to amuse themselves by pretending to be motorbikes, and this rings true. \"Spinning a dit\" is a phrase you hear a lot on board HMS Triumph. It means telling a tale \u2013 a tale that grows with the telling. Even on a fast-attack sub, if there is nothing to attack and you grow tired of listening to passing whales and pretending to target nearby destroyers, life can get repetitive, so the men slip into other worlds. One of the crew has a large tattoo on his back: \"Never stop me dreaming,\" which might stand as a motto for all of them.</p> <p>One evening, I wander into the control room at about midnight. The watch officer and sonar operators are discussing an important philosophical question: would it be more painful to be struck by a whole tuna or a tin of tuna? This is never resolved. These epistemological issues can be sustained over weeks.</p> <p>On my fourth day aboard, I make my greatest discovery: that a badger, washed into the bilge tank in Bahrain, is being kept back'aft. There is a roster to feed it, and somehow it is being kept alive. I insist on seeing it \u2013 what a wonderful story! Of course, say the back'afties, come by this evening. After&#xa0;a couple of hours, even in my dim-witted, mind-clouded, headachy state, I realise I have been conned. Do they even have badgers in Bahrain?</p> <p>But the fantasy has become important to some of the crew. \"It helps pass the time,\" the head badger-keeper tells me. \"It takes the edge off the situation,\" says one of the senior ratings. \"If you get into a situation that's a bit tense, mentioning the badger brings everything back down to earth. If you tried to remain alert 100% of the time it would fatigue you. The ability to relax allows you, when required, to be on the ball.\" It's the ability to switch instantly from badger mode to potential nuclear meltdown mode that defines a good crew.</p> <p>This is a highly segregated society, yet also a very organic one. There are three separate messes, for officers, senior ratings and junior ratings, each situated on the short corridor that serves as the men's living space. The separate messes with their different atmospheres \u2013 the Xbox is never off in the junior rates mess \u2013 suggest division, yet everything else implies unity. The pay structure is relatively flat: Capt Dunn earns around \u00a385,000; the most junior rating gets \u00a330,000. What other organisation has that sort of ratio between top and bottom? And every crew member, officer or rating, has to know everything about the boat \u2013 the function of every one of the thousands of valves. There are half a dozen trainees on the boat studying for their dolphin badges, and they are forgoing all sleep to memorise the handbook they have been given in time for a test that could be sprung on them at any time.</p> <p>Chief Petty Officer Paul \"Jakie\" Foran, the likable but occasionally terrifying Scot who oversees these tests, expects dedication, and woe betide any trainee (AKA oxygen thief) who is discovered having a cup of tea in the junior rates' mess when he could be unearthing the secret of the magazine spray drench system. \"To me you're useless until you're qualified,\" says Chief Foran. \"I'm a bastard, but in a nice way.\"</p> <p>You learn early whether you will&#xa0;survive in this world. One young officer who wants to transfer from surface ships is aboard studying for his dolphins, and is reckoned to have too many airs and graces. The crew are merciless in mocking this affront to their democratic values. He expects to be shown where every valve is and what it's for; don't be absurd (or words to that effect), says Chief Foran, you must find out for yourself. Forget sleep.</p> <p>Forgetting sleep is easy. The crew work 12 hours a day, split into six-hour watches, with changeovers at 1 and 7. Back'afties, because of the heat in which they're working, have shorter but more frequent shifts. When they're not working, most men will be in their \"rack\", but sleeping on a submarine is no fun. The captain, alone on the boat, gets his own cabin; the senior officers share; and everyone else is in hot, cramped, fetid dormitories. Bed space is so limited that some of the most junior ratings have to \"hot bunk\", sleeping in the bed vacated by a man who has just gone on watch.</p> <p>You can hardly move in the bunk \u2013 sitting up is impossible \u2013 and if you turn over you are likely to tip out and end up on the floor. You have to share your rack with a gas mask and various other bits of safety equipment, plus a lot of your own gear. There are small lockers, but I am never offered one, so sleep with bag, clothes and shoes in the bed. Each bunk has an air vent, which does offer some respite from the&#xa0;heat but also blows a blast of cold air into your right ear. \"If the air stops&#xa0;blowing, it means something bad&#xa0;has happened,\" one of the men tells me reassuringly. One morning I&#xa0;am woken by a sudden thud and fear&#xa0;the worst. Later, I discover it was&#xa0;just air being released \u2013 a routine&#xa0;operation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395503416\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/21/1345564222884/TCPO-Tug-Wilson-in-sleepi-010.jpg\" alt=\"TCPO 'Tug' Wilson in sleeping quaters in the weapons room\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">TCPO \u2018Tug\u2019 Wilson in the weapons room (AKA \u2018bomb shop\u2019). Crew members often hug the cruise missiles to stay cool while they sleep.

I sympathise: though I have no nightmares \u2013 I don't sleep deeply enough for that \u2013 the racks do feel like coffins. A better option is to sleep in the \"bomb shop\", where the missiles and torpedoes are kept. It is the quietest, most spacious room on the boat and hugging an 18ft cruise missile keeps you cool.</p> <p>A few men go \"wibble\" after years under water; they just can't stand it any more \u2013 the lack of proper sleep, the&#xa0;absence of privacy, the endlessly repeated conversations, the cycle of meals (it's Wednesday so it must be curry), the unspoken dangers. How do you know when someone has gone wibble? \"The noisy ones go quiet, and&#xa0;the quiet ones suddenly become noisy,\" one man tells me. Chief Johnson recalls one experienced submariner who went wibble and started keeping a&#xa0;book of shipmates he thought had wronged him. \"You're on my list as well,\" he told Johnson before being taken off the boat. He only agreed to leave as long as he could be designated captain of the rescue vessel.</p> <p>The men who go doolally are, however, the exceptions. Most get into&#xa0;a routine \u2013 working, sleeping (as best they can), reading (Kindles are a&#xa0;godsend in this confined world), watching films, spinning dits and dripping. Dripping is another key part of the submariner's lexicon: it means moaning, usually in a lighthearted way&#xa0;and often about the food. \"Ah, you&#xa0;found the one mushroom in the mushroom soup,\" says Lieutenant Gareth Batsford, who as well as being the resident film buff in the officers' mess is also one of the boat's aphorists. \"You wouldn't believe the inability of well-educated, well-trained Royal Navy officers to change bloody toilet rolls,\" he drips at one point.</p> <p>I penetrate many aspects of submarine life in my six days aboard, but&#xa0;sex remains elusive. \"There's a saying \u2013 what happens at sea stays at sea,\" says medical assistant Richard Bastianpulle teasingly. \"I've not really thought about it, except when I'm in bed \u2026 by myself. People let off steam when they come alongside. I'll let you&#xa0;read between the lines on that.\" The boat will usually come into port every two months or so to pick up provisions, and the men \u2013 the single men at least \u2013 can get quite frisky.</p> <p>There is one openly gay man on board. \"They don't treat me any different to anyone else,\" he says. \"I&#xa0;didn't tell anyone at first. I let them ask me rather than me tell them. But it's better to be open and honest than to try and deny it. People will catch you out and they'll start spreading malicious rumours.\" He gets ribbed about his sexuality, but says everyone gets ribbed about something. \"Ribbing doesn't bother me. I let it go over my head. Some days it'll get to you, but you have to brush it off and forget about it.\"</p> <p>The key thing is that bantering must never turn into bullying. The navy, which has become alert to equality and&#xa0;diversity in the past decade, is now good at stamping out bullying, which would destroy the esprit de corps in a community this small and close-knit. Christopher Herbert, a 34-year-old from St Vincent, who I discover up in the dry provisions store mixing his own rap song (The Vagina Rap) on a computer, says he has never suffered racial abuse on the boat. \"It's zero tolerance,\" he says.</p> <p>On my last night in the officers' mess we watch Operation Petticoat, an&#xa0;old submarine film with Cary Grant and Tony Curtis. They must have seen&#xa0;it a dozen times, but love it. The&#xa0;officers \u2013 especially Lieutenant Commander Crosby, who misses his young children hugely \u2013 cry easily during movies. Andy Sharp gives his recipe for the sort of movie that plays well on board, especially with the back'afties: \"Some token violence, some top bollocks on view from time to time, definitely some love interest, a&#xa0;car chase, and it must have a happy ending.\" Most of these teak-like submariners, even Chief Foran, are softies at heart.</p> <p>I do manage to get off at Gibraltar, two miles off the coast in a heavyish swell. A dinghy comes alongside, bashing against the side of the submarine, and one of the crew pushes me&#xa0;into it. The timing of the leap is crucial. Get it wrong and you will be dripping in a literal sense. I end up upside down in the dinghy and wrench my shoulder. I'm just not built to be a&#xa0;submariner, and seem to lack Cary Grant's swagger. I am loaded on to a small patrol vessel, which pipes its salutation to the departing submarine. I am relieved to be breathing fresh air, yet sad not to be heading home with HMS Triumph. As a parting gift, the captain has given me an honorary dolphins badge, and I will treasure it always. Despite all my shortcomings, I&#xa0;feel I was starting to become part of the life of the boat. Me and the badger.</p>",

There were similar calls Monday by presidential challenger Mitt Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan, congressional leaders and conservative talk show hosts. </p> <p>Under state election law, Akin would face no financial penalties if he pulls out by 6pm ET on Tuesday, and the party would be free to pick an alternative. If he goes beyond that time, the next date for withdrawal would be 25 September, but that would require a court order to allow him leave the race. </p> <p>Leaving it until September could also mean he would face significant financial penalties, such as reimbursing the cost of reprinting ballot papers or other election material.</p> <p>But the Republicans' difficulties on abortion are unlikely to go away even if Akin does quit. On Tuesday, as the leadership turned up the heat on Akin, the party approved language in its platform calling for a constitutional amendment banning abortion with no explicit exemptions in cases of rape and incest.</p> <p>Meanwhile, another Republican congressman, Steve King of Iowa, inflamed the row, defending Akin and suggesting that he'd never heard of a woman getting pregnant from statutory rape or incest. </p> <p><a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/08/steve-king-statutory-rape.php\">Talking Points Memo</a> on Monday reported that King told Iowa radio station KMEG-TV reported him saying: \"Well I just haven't heard of that being a circumstance that's been brought to me in any personal way and I'd be open to discussion about that subject matter.\" </p> <p>The controversy has also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/paul-ryan-pro-life-akin\">focused attention on the anti-abortion views</a> of Mitt Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan. </p> <p>The Missouri seat held by Democrat Claire McCaskill is regarded by Republicans as the top target in the campaign to take control of the Senate. McCaskill, who has used the row to portray Akin as an extremist, is urging him to stay in the race. </p> <p>The Republican Senate campaign committee and conservative Super Pacs have withdrawn about $10m in financial support for Akin. The last remaining hope for Akin is to attract donations from individual donors. </p> <p>If Akin quits, he could be replaced either by Jim Brunner, a businessman who came second in the primary with 30% \u2013 6% behind Akin \u2013 or Sarah Steelman, a former state treasurer, who took 29%. Brunner has already been sounding out party members about replacing Akin.</p> <p>Public Policy Polling, in a survey conducted on Monday night, showed the row has not had any significant impact on voting intentions yet. Akin is leading McCaskill 44% to 43%, almost unchanged from May when he was ahead 45% to 44%.</p> <p>It may be that the poll was conducted too soon to fully register any unease with Akin.</p> <p>As well as possible repercussions for the Senate race, Democrats also see Akin as useful in highlighting differences between the Obama-Biden ticket and the Romney-Ryan ticket on abortion. </p> <p>In the light of the row, there will be pressure to change the draft to include exceptions for rape and incest.</p>",
  "<p>The Republican party, which has supported a constitutional ban on abortion since 1984, has once again officially endorsed such a ban without exceptions for rape, incest or a threat to the mother's life, according to reports.</p> <p>If adopted by the party next Monday at a vote in Tampa, the official anti-abortion position will be more conservative than that held by its presidential candidate, Mitt Romney.</p> <p>The language was approved by the Republican platform committee on Tuesday morning, <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/g-o-p-approves-strict-anti-abortion-language-in-party-platform/?smid=tw-thecaucus&amp;seid=auto\">according to the New York Times</a>.</p> <p>Pro-choice Republicans expressed disappointment and said that the document does not reflect the beliefs of the majority of the party but a more extreme view of the right.</p> <p>The news come amid a fierce and continuing row over a Republican Senate candidate's suggestion on Sunday that victims of \"legitimate rape\" are unlikely to get pregnant. Romney's campaign spokeswoman has said that a Romney-Paul Ryan administration would not oppose abortion in instances of rape and that neither candidate agrees with Todd Akin's comments.</p> <p>The draft document is similar to platforms adopted in 2008, 2004 and 2000, <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/20/first-on-cnn-gop-prepares-tough-anti-abortion-platform/\">according to CNN</a>, which first reported the draft language. It states: \"Faithful to the 'self-evident' truths enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, we assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed,\" the draft platform declares. \"We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children.\"</p> <p>The \"human life amendment\" is still to be approved by delegates to the Republican National Convention next week.</p> <p>Kelly Ferguson, executive chair of the Republican Majority for Choice, expressed disappointment with the language of the anti-abortion plank and with the platform committee, which she said had become more socially conservative. She said: \"The majority of Republicans and Americans do not support an all-out ban on abortion. The party has also chosen a presidential candidate who came out and said he did not support an all out ban with no exceptions.</p> <p>\"There has been a discussion from the top of the party to distance themselves from Todd Akin's statements on rape. We are calling for them to distance themselves from the policy.\"</p> <p>The RNC position is that the platform should be welcoming of different views on different social issues, but at the \"very least there should be exemptions for rape, incest and to save the life of a mother\".</p> <p>Some pro-choice Republicans say the current draft of the abortion plank in the platform, although bad, is less extreme than in previous years.</p> <p>Ann Stone, of Republicans for Choice, said: \"It is bad, but it is not as bad as in the past. We have made some minute progress. It doesn't have exemptions and it doesn't not have exemptions. In 1992, there was an explicit reference to having no exemptions. The language is very vague and less inflammatory. The only other thing that is mildly positive is that they did not come out and embrace personhood.\"</p> <p>The gulf between the Republican party's position on abortion and that of its presidential nominee is not new.</p> <p>In 2008, the party adopted a similar plank on abortion, despite senator John McCain, its nominee, having urged the party in the past to make exceptions. </p> <p>Former president George W Bush also supported exemptions for abortion in cases of rape incest and when a woman's life was in danger.</p>",

  "<p>More than a month into the battle for Aleppo, the rebels who seized control of much of the city sense that its residents do not yet fully support them. Opposition fighters \u2013 around 3,000 of them \u2013 are almost the only people moving around the eastern half that the Free Syrian Army now controls. The small numbers of non-fighters who remain seem to pay them little heed. Few seem openly welcoming.</p> <p>\"Yes it's true,\" said Sheikh Tawfik Abu Sleiman, a rebel commander sitting on the ground floor of his fourth new headquarters \u2013 the other three were bombed. \"Around 70% of Aleppo city is with the regime. It has always been that way. The countryside is with us and the city is with them. We are saying that we will only be here as long as it takes to get the job done, to get rid of the Assads. After that, we will leave and they can build the city that they want.\"</p> <p>As the sun set on the first day of Eid al-Fitr marking the end of Ramadan on Sunday, Sheikh Abu Sleiman visited a mosque in the north of the city and took up the microphone. \"I told them that we understand their suffering,\" he said. \"We are sensitive to their needs and we know that this has been a major disruption. And that when we finish, Aleppo is theirs.\" The sheikh's words echoed from a minaret in a rebel-held district across residential streets long since deserted.</p> <p>One of the two most festive occasions in the Islamic calendar is usually a time of neighbourly visits, new toys for children and streetside frivolity. But this year Eid bypassed Aleppo.Almost every shop in the east of the city remained shuttered. There were more scraps of windblown rubbish moving on main roads than there were cars. The crackle of celebratory fireworks was replaced by a relentless soundtrack of gunfire and bomb blasts.</p> <p>What those who have stayed behind now think of the war raging around them remains difficult to gauge. Since Sunday most residents still in frontline areas have seemed to be leaving. None wanted to talk.</p> <p>Some residents gave the newcomers bottles of water and food. Exchanges between rebels and residents were low-key and civil. \"Be careful down that way, uncle,\" a 23-year-old rebel from the nearby town of al-Bab told an elderly man. \"See that plane, it has been bombing 300 metres ahead.\"</p> <p>The man craned his neck as a fighter jet began its attack, plunging low enough for its markings to be clear against a vivid blue sky as its two rockets crashed into a building. A heavy machine gun on a crossroads thundered as the jet passed overhead.</p> <p>Not far away, families clutching black plastic bags of belongings walked silently down the hill from the suburb of Saif al-Dowli. Tanks shells crashed into buildings not far behind them. The war's newest refugees passed several pharmacies and corner stores that had been looted but not ransacked. \"We take what we need,\" said one rebel commander. \"But nothing more.\"</p> <p>Another old man walked slowly up the hill and across an intersection towards one of two impromptu rebel outposts. A helicopter hovered menacingly above and chunks of masonry from a nearby explosion made his going difficult. \"Where are you going, Haj [respected elder],\" one rebel asked him. \"I want to go to the mosque,\" he replied.</p> <p>\"The mosque?,\" the rebel said, pointing to a no-man's land further up the hill. \"It's very dangerous. You will have to go back to your house.\" The rebel called for a cup of water to give to the man, who seemed confused and tired. Other fighters eased his heavy frame into a plastic chair. \"Who is better, the regime army or the Free Syrian Army,\" one asked him. He waved his arms and said: \"I swear I don't know. You are all my sons.\"</p> <p>The old man wandered slowly back down the road, oblivious as mayhem erupted around him. A unit had seen a helicopter approaching from the east and had opened fire with another machine gun. The helicopter flew away unharmed, just like the jet minutes earlier. \"We really need someone who can shoot these things,\" said a rebel commander, Jaafar Furad.</p> <p>Winning the skirmishes overhead could prove decisive in the battle for Aleppo. For now though, the outgunned rebels in the city's south-west are trying to claw back gains on another front. The suburb of Salahedin, their stronghold until <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/09/syrian-rebels-withdraw-fighters-aleppo\" title=\"\">air strikes forced them to withdraw</a>, remains the most bitterly contested corner of the Syrian uprising.</p> <p>Early on Monday a Japanese reporter, Mika Yamamoto, 45, from the Japan Press news agency, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/21/mika-yamamoto-journalist-killed-syria\" title=\"\">was killed</a> during a clash in the area between regime gunmen and the rebel group she was with. Regime forces have entered the neighbourhood and are probing into adjoining districts. The street fighting is intense, sometimes room to room, the two sides separated only by walls. \"We can hear them and sometimes we insult each other,\" said Mohammed Jou, a carpenter turned rebel from the Aleppo countryside.</p> <p>Barely a soul moves on the frontline. Rebels tiptoe over broken glass and tread carefully through lounge rooms and hallways as they try to reach fighting positions. Some use sledgehammers to knock holes through house walls for rat runs to avoid snipers.</p> <p>Syrian rebels are not alone in using these routes to the frontline. In recent days another group of fighters has arrived, jihadists from other parts of the Islamic world. The Guardian saw four such fighters \u2013 a Saudi, a Pakistani, an Algerian and a Senegalese man \u2013 waiting at a staging point not far from Saif al-Dowli on Monday. Others, perhaps as many as 30, have entered Salahedin. \"Are you a Muslim?\" the Senegalese fighter asked in response to a greeting.</p> <p>\"They're not planning on coming out,\" said Moustafa Kamal, a volunteer from al-Bab. Asked about the presence of foreign fighters, a long-predicted and often feared dynamic in Syria's civil war, Kamal said: \"I welcome them. They are very brave and they are very good fighters. They are not scared of anyone.\"</p> <p>Other rebels were more circumspect. \"They're a very big problem,\" said Sheikh Abu Marwan Osman, in al-Bab. \"They don't understand Islam and they will make things more difficult for all of us.\"</p> <p>\"We have enough challenges already,\" said a rebel commander in the north of the city. \"These people will give us all a headache. We need to prove to the people that this revolution will work.\"</p> <p><strong>Leader comment, page 30 </strong></p>",
  "<p>Everything Everywhere, owner of the T-Mobile and Orange mobile phone networks, is to drop its widely criticised name as a consumer brand in a marketing makeover this year.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/consultations/variation-1800mhz-lte-wimax/statement\" title=\"\">landmark ruling by regulators</a> Everything Everywhere on Tuesday won the right to launch the UK's first 4G mobile internet service in September, and the company will use the occasion to introduce a third brand to the public.</p> <p>Standing for fourth generation, 4G technology is supposed to deliver internet download speeds 10 times faster than the 3G service which helped bring the internet to mobile phones a decade ago.</p> <p>More bandwidth is needed to help networks keep up with the growing demand for data from smartphones. Mobile networks struggle to broadcast video over 3G \u2013 most moving images are watched on the small screen using wi-fi connections. It is hoped 4G will make smartphone video streaming an every day experience.</p> <p>The decision will give the UK a taste of 4G in time for Christmas, allowing it to catch up with other European nations and the United States, which already have dozens of superfast mobile networks up and running. Britain is not due to auction the extra spectrum Vodafone, O2 and Three say they need for 4G until next year. But EE has enough of its own to push the button now, giving it a six to 12-month head-start on rivals.</p> <p>Telecoms watchdog Ofcom has granted EE permission to flick the switch as soon as 11 September, and while the service may not be ready until a little later, EE has been installing equipment since the beginning of this year in anticipation of early roll-out. It has already covered a number of major population centres.</p> <p>By coincidence, the date is a day ahead of Apple's rumoured 12 September iPhone 5 unveiling. The latest Apple phone is expected to go on sale in October, although it is far from certain that the device will support 4G on the spectrum 1800MHz band being used by EE for 4G.</p> <p>It is thought that some of the newest Nokia smartphones, which use Windows software, will be compatible. While there will be very few 4G handsets and tablet computers in time for Christmas, EE will be able to market the service using dongles which plug into laptops to give them a mobile signal.</p> <p>\"This ruling could well provide a springboard for Everything Everywhere in the lucrative customer acquisition stakes,\" said Stuart Orr at management consultancy Accenture. \"This will be especially true if they are then able to offer [a 4G] enabled iPhone 5 ahead of anyone else.\"</p> <p>There is speculation the brand name used to plug the service could be 4G Everywhere \u2013 it was <a href=\"http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tm/t-find/t-find-text/tmtsearch-default.aspx\" title=\"\">registered</a> by the company as a trademark in May, alongside 4G Everything and 4GEE.</p> <p>In a statement the company said: \"We are planning to launch a new brand in the UK later this year. This new brand will sit alongside our existing brands Orange and T-Mobile. We will reveal more information on our exciting plans in due course.\"</p> <p>Orange, which rose to prominence through its high profile sponsorships of the BAFTA film awards and the Women's Prize for Fiction, may not be permanent fixture in the UK telecoms landscape, however. EE's owners, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, are thought to be keen to float their UK joint venture once conditions in the financial markets improve, which could eventually trigger a decision to drop their respective Orange and T-Mobile brands.</p> <p>EE's head start on 4G provoked a furious reaction from Vodafone, which said it was \"shocked\" at the Ofcom's decision, while O2 said it was \"hugely disppointed\". Spectrum acquired in next year's auction, currently occupied by digital TV, will not be freed up for use nationwide before next Autumn.</p> <p>It is thought unlikely that rival networks will seek an injunction to stop EE's launch, although legal experts say they could make complaints at a later date. \"Even if there is no reason for challenge today, the other operators will presumably be keeping the situation under review and will be looking for any possible action on the part of Everything Everywhere with their newly acquired monopoly status that could justify a complaint under UK or EU competition law,\" said Patrick Clark, telecoms expert at law firm Taylor Wessing.</p> <p>In a separate deal, EE confirmed on Tuesday that it had sold for an undisclosed sum a quarter of its 1800MHz holding to the UK's smallest network Three, owned by Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa. The company was obliged to sell some of its large holding as a condition of its creation through the merger of T-Mobile and Orange. Three will not be able to use the spectrum for 4G immediately, as EE is not obliged to hand it over until September 2013.</p>",
  "<p>Witnesses who filmed and photographed Tony Scott's fatal leap from a bridge into Los Angeles harbour are reportedly hawking the footage to media outlets.</p> <p>The material captures the British director crouching moments before he jumped an estimated 185ft to his death on Sunday. The <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2012/08/21/tony-scott-death-video-shopped/\">show business website TMZ</a> said it had seen \u2013 but not purchased \u2013 some of the footage.</p> <p>Some witnesses said they assumed at first it was an extreme sports stunt, not a suicide. A surveillance camera from a nearby business also recorded the jump.</p> <p>News of the macabre footage came as it emerged Scott made meticulous preparations for his death and had planned to use the bridge from which he jumped in a blockbuster film.</p> <p>The 68-year-old left a list of contact names, numbers and instructions in his car for police to find after he jumped, one of several notes he left in various locations.</p> <p>The most detailed note, which reportedly explained why he took his own life, was left in his office. Its contents were not immediately revealed, leaving his motives a mystery to the public as harrowing details emerged of his final moments.</p> <p>ABC reported on Monday that the 68-year-old had inoperable brain cancer but hours later the theory was rebuffed by Craig Harvey, the coroner's department chief investigator. \"A family spokesman told us late this afternoon that the information was not true, but we will be looking at everything,\" he told reporters. ABC quickly retreated from the story.</p> <p>An autopsy had been completed but final results must wait six to eight weeks for toxicology tests, added Harvey.</p> <p>The lack of obvious motive baffled commentators who said the British director of Top Gun, Crimson Tide and Beverly Hills Cop II appeared to have it all: success, wealth, respect, a wife and two young children.</p> <p>His brother and production partner, Sir Ridley Scott, flew from London to Los Angeles as tributes continued flowing for the late director. Tom Cruise, who was planning to make a Top Gun sequel with Scott, said in a statement: \"Tony was my dear friend and I will really miss him \u2026 My deepest sorrow and thoughts are with his family at this time.\"</p> <p>Oliver Stone tweeted: \"My favorite Tony Scott film is \"Enemy of the State\" (1998). Brilliant and way ahead of its time. Will miss him.\"</p> <p>It emerged that Scott was very familiar with the Vincent Thomas bridge near Long Beach, about 30 miles south of his Beverly Hills home, because he planned to use it in a remake of the 1970 cult classic The Warriors, about a gang crossing New York to their Coney Island home pursued by rival gangs.</p> <p>In a 2009 interview with the website Rotten Tomatoes Scott said he wanted to switch the story to Los Angeles because it was horizontal whereas New York was vertical.</p> <p>He envisaged the climax of the film on the suspension bridge which spans the harbour. \"I'm hoping to get 100,000 real gang members standing on the Vincent Thomas bridge for one shot. I've been meeting the various gangs as part of the research. I've met them all, Crips, Bloods, The 18th Street Gang, The Vietnamese and so on. They all love The Warriors, so it was, 'Yeah, fuck yeah, we'll be in that!\"</p> <p>Witnesses described the director's final minutes on a sun-drenched early afternoon. After parking his black Toyota Prius he made his way to a fence on the bridge's southern side.</p> <p>\"He was looking around and fumbling with something at his feet,\" David Silva, a car passenger on the northern side, told <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/08/tony-scott-didnt-have-brain-cancer-family-says.html\">the Los Angeles Times</a>. \"He looked nervous. I thought it was some extreme-sports guy.\"</p>",
  "<p>An unusual coalition of senior and grassroots Republicans is making a concerted push to force rape-row candidate Todd Akin to quit the Missouri senate race ahead of a state election deadline on Tuesday evening.</p> <p>But Akin is stubbornly refusing to go and aired a 30-second ad on Monday night apologising for his comment that \"legitimate rape\" rarely leads to pregnancy.</p> <p>Further evidence that Akin is determined to defy the pressure came from Buzzfeed editor in chief Ben Smith <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedBen/statuses/237929985439051776\">who reported in a tweet</a> that the six-term Republican congressman had also bought up advertising time later this month.</p> <p>Tea Party groups, some of whom helped Akin secure victory in last week, urged him to quit on Tuesday following similar calls Monday by presidential challenger Mitt Romney and his vice-presidential running mate Paul Ryan, Congressional leaders and conservative talk show hosts. </p> <p>Under state election law, Akin would face no financial penalties if he pulls out by 6pm ET tonight, and the party would be free to pick an alternative. </p> <p>If he goes beyond that time, the next date for withdrawal would be September 25, but that would require a court order to allow him leave the race. </p> <p>Leaving it to September 25 could also mean he would face significant financial penalties, such as reimbursing the cost of reprinting ballot papers or other election material.</p> <p>But the Republicans' difficulties on abortion are unlikely to go away even if Akin does quit. On Tuesday, as the leadership turned up the heat on Akin, the party approved language in its platform calling for a constitiutional amendment banning abortion with no explicit exemptions in cases of rape and incest.</p> <p>A draft <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/20/first-on-cnn-gop-prepares-tough-anti-abortion-platform/\">version of the language obtained by CNN</a> said: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Faithful to the 'self-evident' truths enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, we assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, another Republican congressman, Steve King of Iowa, enflamed the row, defending Akin and suggesting that he'd never heard of a woman getting pregnant from statutory rape or incest. </p> <p>Talking Points Memo on Monday <a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/08/steve-king-statutory-rape.php reported that King told Iowa radio station KMEG-TV http://www.kmeg14.com/story/19324372/rep-steve-king-on-the-campaign-trail\">reported him saying</a>: \"Well I just haven't heard of that being a circumstance that's been brought to me in any personal way and I'd be open to discussion about that subject matter.\" </p> <p>The controversy has also <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/20/paul-ryan-pro-life-akin\">focused attention on the anti-abortion views</a> of Mitt Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan. </p> <p>The Missouri seat held by Democrat Claire McCaskill is regarded by Republicans as the top target in the campaign to take control of the Senate. McCaskill, who has used the row to portray Akin as an extremist, is urging him to stay in the race. </p> <p>Amy Kremer, chairwoman of the Tea Party Express, joined the calls for him to stand down, telling CNN the fact that McCaskill was urging him to remain \"speaks volumes\".</p> <p>It is unusual for the senior Republican leadership and Tea Party groups to be so united. Part of the reason for the existence of the Tea Party movement was a backlash against the party leadership in Washington.</p> <p>If Akin quits, he could be replaced either by Jim Brunner, a businessman who came second in the primary with 30% \u2013 6% behind Akin \u2013 or Sarah Steelman, a former state treasurer, who took 29%. </p> <p>Brunner has already been sounding out party members about replacing Akin.</p> <p>The Republican senate campaign committee and conservative Super Pacs have withdrawn about $10m in financial support for Akin. The last remaining hope for Akin is to attract donations from individual donors. </p> <p>One of the tests of whether there is still support for him in Missouri will be the level of donations in response to his new ad, and that might determine whether he remains in the race.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R57E3S8RO7A?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R57E3S8RO7A\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In his 30-second ad, Akin apologised over his comment suggesting that 'legitimate rape' rarely led to pregnancy. </p> <p>He said: \"Rape is an evil act. I used the wrong words in the wrong way, and for that I apologise. As the father of two daughters, I want tough justice for predators. I have a compassionate heart for the victims of sexual assault, and I pray for them.</p> <p>\"The fact is rape can lead to pregnancy. The truth is rape has many victims. The mistake I made was in the words I said, not in the heart I hold. I ask for your forgiveness.\"</p> <p>Public Policy Polling, in a survey conducted on Monday night, showed the row has not had any significant impact on voting intentions yet. Akin is leading McCaskill% to 43%, almost unchanged from May when he was ahead 45% to 44%.</p> <p>It may be that the poll was conducted too soon to fully register any unease with Akin.</p> <p>As well as possible repercussions for the senate race, Democrats also see Akin as useful in highlighting differences between the Obama-Biden ticket and the Romney-Ryan on abortion. </p> <p>In the light of the row, there will be pressure to change the draft to include exceptions for rape and incest.</p>",
  "<p>Frankel is confidently expected to spark celebrations from an enthusiastic crowd when he runs in the International at York on Wednesday, for which his odds are 1-7. But, for those who wonder what the reaction would be to a wholly unexpected first defeat, there is a ready precedent in the inaugural running of this race 40 years ago, when the great Brigadier Gerard was beaten for the only time in 18 appearances.</p> <p>\"What I remember more than anything else was the silence after the race, the silence as we all tried to take in what we had seen,\" says Lord Grimthorpe, who was a teenage schoolboy on his summer holidays from Harrow at the time. On Wednesday Grimthorpe will return to the track wearing two hats, as chair of York's race committee and as adviser to Khalid Abdullah, owner of Frankel and of the Juddmonte stud which sponsors the International.</p> <p>\"I think there are obvious similarities between Brigadier Gerard and Frankel,\" Grimthorpe says. \"They have both created a great deal of excitement and their presence is big news for racing in Yorkshire.\"</p> <p>Like Frankel, Brigadier Gerard went to York as British racing's number one box office draw. But his unbeaten record fell to an inspired ride by an unknown Panamanian, Braulio Baeza, and his enigmatic mount, Roberto, trained by Vincent O'Brien at Ballydoyle.</p> <p>Also in the crowd was Peter Ord, now a retired teacher, who will return to the track on Wednesday. \"I missed the two races before in order to get a place on the rail for the parade ring to see 'The Brigadier' and he didn't disappoint,\" he recalls.</p> <p>\"I raced to try and get a place in the stands but it was so busy that you just couldn't move. Two furlongs out, [Joe] Mercer pulled The Brigadier out and the crowd roared in the expectation that he would go past but it soon became apparent that it wasn't going to happen and by the time they reached me with half a furlong to run the runners went past in virtual silence.</p> <p>\"I just felt robbed. I think I just walked back to the car and went home. There didn't seem any point in watching any of the other races afterwards.\"</p> <p>If any horse is to deflate Wednesday's crowd on the Knavesmire as Roberto did that day, it will probably be St Nicholas Abbey, also prepared at Ballydoyle, which is now run by Aidan O'Brien. The tactics which O'Brien will use have been the subject of much speculation, since he will also field two apparent pacemakers, and paddock-watchers are likely to see him delivering a long lecture to his three jockeys before giving them the leg-up.</p> <p>Back in 1972 Vincent O'Brien took a more relaxed attitude. Baeza told the trainer he was confident of victory and, in reciprocation, O'Brien decided against giving him specific instructions. \"I told him about the horses and the track and, after that, I left it to him,\" he told reporters.</p> <p>Roberto set off at a fearsome pace, leaping from the starting stalls so quickly that Jean Hislop, the wife of Brigadier Gerard's owner, reportedly said it looked as though he had been stung by a bee. At the two-furlong pole Brigadier Gerard inched towards the leader under pressure from Mercer. He got to within a length of the leader but had no more to give and was eased down in the final strides for a three-length defeat.</p> <p>Both horses beat the old course record. Connections later claimed that Brigadier Gerard was found to be a sick horse in the immediate aftermath, mucus pouring from his nose when he returned to his box. It was also suggested that he had been softened up by hard-earned successes in the Eclipse and the King George the previous month.</p> <p>John Sanderson, who was clerk of the course at the time, recalls seeing Mercer after the race. \"I found Joe in the weighing room and the poor chap was sitting there, almost crying. I put my arm around him and said, 'Was it the ground?' and he said, 'No, he just wasn't himself today'.</p> <p>\"There are no excuses at York. It's a fair, flat track and the ground will be perfect. There's nowhere to hide. Frankel is an absolutely outstanding racehorse and let's hope he delivers.\"</p> <p>Mercer will also cheer for the favourite from his home in Newmarket. \"I can't see Frankel being beaten,\" he says. \"He's the best I have seen since The Brigadier.\"</p> <p>But Mercer is unwilling, or perhaps unable, to declare which of the pair is superior. \"Someone asked me, 'If I had a gun, which one would you choose?' But they didn't have a gun. So I didn't.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lonmin has been forced to go cap in hand to its banks after admitting that it will breach its loan agreements as a result of a strike that led to the shooting of 34 miners last week.</p> <p>The London-listed platinum miner was forced to <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/Article.aspx?id=201208211606554922K\" title=\"\">warn investors</a> that the shutdown of its Marikana mine 60 miles from Johannesburg will result in debt covenants being breached.</p> <p>Lonmin said it was in \"constructive discussions\" with its banking syndicate about resolving the problem.</p> <p>However, the company admitted that it has been forced into \"reviewing all the options available to strengthen its financial structure, including possible access to the equity capital markets\".</p> <p>The formal announcement that the FTSE 100 miner is considering an emergency rights issue comes just three days after it strongly dismissed reports that it was planning such a move to raise up to $1bn.</p> <p>In addition, last Thursday the company released a <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/Article.aspx?id=201208161408171819K\" title=\"\">formal statement</a> saying: \"Net debt remains well within the limits and terms of its existing bank debt facilities.\"</p> <p>Analysts say the company will have little choice but to tap shareholders for an extra $700m-$1bn.

  "<p>For those unfamiliar with US corporate law, OnLive's announcement on Monday that it would be going through a process called the \"assignment for the benefit of creditors (ABC)\" would have been somewhat bewildering. </p> <p>ABC is a kind of mini-insolvency, a method of staying in business despite extreme financial difficulties. There is no direct UK equivalent, and even in the US it is much less common than the Chapter seven and Chapter 11 forms of bankruptcy. So what does it all mean?</p> <p>\"It's a bit complicated,\" says Jas Purewal, an interactive entertainment lawyer at Osborne Clarke, \"ABC is an alternative to formal insolvency proceedings under US law. It involves selling on the assets of a business to a third party, which takes those assets free of any other liabilities the company may have. </p> <p>\"OnLive can't pay out to creditors and so has decided to arrange for the valuable assets of the business to be sold, which in theory raises cash to pay the creditors, and at the same time means that a new phoenix can arise from the ashes of OnLive and carry out the business of the company.\"</p> <p>The immediate outcome is this: the OnLive assets and trademarks have been acquired by a newly-formed company \u2013 backed by investment firm Lauder Partners \u2013 which will continue to operate under the OnLive name. </p> <p>Although the details are ambiguous, it seems the company will be operated by the OnLive directors, including the company's CEO and founder, Steve Perlman.</p> <p>Under the terms of the ABC process, OnLive has been unable to transfer its shares or employees to the new entity, meaning that all of its staff were made redundant. However, according to an OnLive statement, almost half have been re-employed by the new company, and the others will be offered consulting roles.</p> <p>\"The difficulty that can arise from this sort of situation is that there's very often not enough money to pay the other creditors,\" says Purewal. </p> <p>\"In theory, transferring all the valuable assets in one go to one party raises the maximum amount of cash, but often there are still significant losses for those creditors\". </p> <p>Indeed, the smartphone manufacturer HTC has written off its $40m (\u00a325m) investment in the company and<a href=\"http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/bt-prepared-to-write-off-onlive-investment/0101582\"> BT has also indicated</a> that its 2.6% stake in the firm is likely to be lost. </p> <p>BT has not disclosed how much it paid for its stake, and HTC has not said how much of the company $40m bought. </p> <p>There has also been anger from employees, with one unnamed source <a href=\"http://www.joystiq.com/2012/08/17/source-onlive-ceo-showed-no-remorse-when-announcing-layoffs/\">claiming to game site Joystiq</a> that Perlman showed no remorse when telling staff about the situation. </p> <p>\"OnLive stressed that nothing has changed, but then half the staff gets dismissed,\" says Alex Tutty of media law firm, Sheridans. \"This is, I believe, symptomatic of US employment law not being the same as UK law, where we enjoy better employment protection.\"</p> <p>One question is whether it might have been simpler to merely seek an extra round of funding to keep the original company afloat. Apparently not.</p> <p>\"It is much more difficult to restructure a business when you have lot of competing interests and liabilities,\" says Tutty. \"It can be easier to put everything in to a new company and go on from there. This is all about cutting away the deadweight but going about it in this manner is peculiar to US state law and would not be possible in the UK\".</p> <p>OnLive has been keen to stress that its consumer service will remain unaffected. In a defiant opening paragraph, the company's statement read:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The OnLive Game and Desktop Services, all OnLive Devices and Apps, as well as all OnLive partnerships, are expected to continue without interruption and all customer purchases will remain intact; users are not expected to notice any change whatsoever. OnLive's current initiatives will continue as well, with major announcements of new products and services planned in the coming weeks and months.</p> </blockquote> <p>So what went wrong for a company that has led and innovated in the burgeoning world of cloud-based gaming since its formation in 2003? </p> <p>OnLive's proposition \u2013 to provide Triple AAA games playable via a streaming internet service \u2013 has always been a compelling one, and content partnerships were formed with over 50 publishers and developers. There has certainly been plenty of hype around the whole idea of cloud gaming, culminating recently in Sony's $380m purchase of OnLive's close rival, Gaikai. </p> <p>One possibility is that the company has simply been too ambitious. OnLive is playable via Mac and PC, as well as multiple smartphone and tablet devices, but the company also produced and distributed its own console so customers could play via TV, too. That's a lot of bases to cover. </p> <p>\"It looks like there's value in the business going forward or the ABC would not have occurred,\" says Tutty. \"However, they seem to have spent too much money trying to make [the technology] work on too many devices when they should have focused. </p> <p>\"They're essentially an early stage company but with the liabilities of having 200 employees and giving out huge amounts of free hardware to build an install base \u2013 at the Eurogamer event last year it was ridiculous, there were queues going round the block and yet it appears hardly anyone in the UK uses OnLive\".</p> <p>Additionally, when you look at the games provided on the service, they're often older titles, with only a smattering of genuine Triple-A blockbusters. There's also no support from Activision or EA, the largest third-party publishers in the world. </p> <p>\"OnLive's problem was that it failed to find a unique hook that would make consumers go 'I have to own that service'\", says industry analyst Nicholas Lovell, who <a href=\"http://www.gamesbrief.com/2010/10/ten-games-businesse-that-are-doomed/\">predicted the demise of OnLive</a> back in 2010. \"They were pitching convenience: no more physical discs, no more downloads, just fast instant games, whenever you wanted them. The problem was that those fast instant games were games that you didn't want. </p> <p>\"They were going up against Sony, which had exclusive titles like Uncharted and Little Big Planet, and Microsoft, which had Halo and Gears of War, <em>and</em> Nintendo, as well as PC gaming with titles like World of Warcraft. They were going up against those platforms with no exclusive content. </p> <p>\"Their marketing didn't appeal to the consumer's rebellious nature like PlayStation does. Instead, it was: spend a monthly fee to get a whole bunch of games, but not modern ones, and not the ones your mates are playing. A rational message appealing to the logical brain, but without follow through.\"</p> <p>In a sense, OnLive was having to appeal to classic early adopters, but unfortunately the restrictions of its streaming service \u2013 the odd bit of lag here and there, lower resolution visuals, plus older titles \u2013 were the very things that turned early adopters off.</p> <p>And while Netflix has survived as a mass market streaming content service with a catalogue of older content, it is now turning to the production of original programming such as House of Cards and Hemlock Grove to maintain its user-base. OnLive has no comparable offerings.</p> <p>In the Joystiq news story covering OnLive's restructure, one insider source allegedly told the site that the average peak amount of concurrent users on there service was just 1,800. </p> <p>And so OnLive is dead \u2013 long live OnLive? It seems there had always been a hope that a Sony-like giant, threatened by the possibilities of cloud gaming, would come in to buy OnLive and its technology-set.</p> <p>That didn't happen. Sony backed the other horse, and now OnLive has to rebuild faith in its vision with both investors and consumers. </p> <p>If the future of gaming really is in the clouds, it seems it's going to take one company a little while longer to reach them.</p>",
  "<p>A bright-green kit car marked \"51 Nigeria\" stands under grey skies, yards from where the traffic endlessly groans out of the Blackwall tunnel. Young black scenesters, wearing smart-casual, pose in front of it, then mill over to the red carpet in front of the Greenwich Odeon, where <a href=\"http://www.voxafrica.co.uk\" title=\"\">VoxAfrica</a>, \"the first bilingual, pan-African channel\", is working the interview lineup. Tall women in traditional dress loll on benches nearby. This is the premiere of <a href=\"http://www.tangowithmefilm.com\" title=\"\">Tango with Me</a>, the fourth Nollywood film to get a mainstream release in the UK. PR rep Moses is getting antsy; he gets the cinema to make an announcement that the screening will be starting soon. No one pays any attention. Tonight, we're on African time, not Greenwich mean time.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2010/sep/21/nollywood-nigerian-film-industry\" title=\"\">Nollywood</a>, Nigeria's film industry, is straining to up its game. Tango with Me \u2013 a melodrama about the aftermath of a wedding-night rape \u2013 is the latest to reach beyond VHS and DVD-led distribution, opting for the kind of overseas theatrical release needed to help legitimise Nigerian cinema and maybe even bring in non-African audiences. The budget is high by African standards (80-100m naira \u2013 about \u00a3326,000); the film stars industry queens <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genevieve_Nnaji\" title=\"\">Genevieve Nnaji</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joke_Silva\" title=\"\">Joke Silva</a> as well as rising newcomer <a href=\"http://nigeriafilms.com/news/16374/27/top-actor-joseph-benjamin-lauds-genevieve-nnaji.html\" title=\"\">Joseph Benjamin</a>; it has, in the eyes of director <a href=\"http://www.africafilmacademy.org/mahmood-ali-balogun\" title=\"\">Mahmood Ali-Balogun</a> , \"the right production values\" \u2013 the most salient problem for Nollywood, which likes to build them cheap and quick.</p> <p>Everyone is buzzing, especially <a href=\"http://www.djabass.com\" title=\"\">DJ Abass</a>, \"entertainment consultant\" for African events in London and compere for the screening: \"If you enjoy this movie, and you don't tell anyone, then I won't tell you what will happen to you. Just check your email inbox in a month's time.\"</p> <p>I'm not sure what I'm risking by sharing this, but I kind of enjoyed Tango with Me. I admired its forthrightness about rape in Nigeria \u2013 apparently discussing it openly is still a problem \u2013 but cinematically it still felt rudimentary: too many static camera setups, lots of long, on-the-nose dialogue scenes. Maybe I'm too used to western dramatic practices, with their emphasis on subtext and tension. One thing I really enjoyed, though, was watching it with a guffawing, interjecting, gesticulating African audience. Each time Benjamin's character, Uzo, impotent with the almond-eyed Nnaji, plays away from home, some wag shouts, \"Oh, Jos-eph!\" in mock indignation.</p> <p>At the Q&amp;A session afterwards, there's much pontification on whether Tango with Me is the leap into the mainstream that Nollywood has been waiting for. Everyone seems to agree the industry is in a transitional phase: \"The Nollywood of yesterday is different to the Nollywood of today, and it will be different to the Nollywood of tomorrow,\" as a producer in the audience puts it. There's certainly plenty of other evidence to suggest that it is moving on to a more established, professional footing: more film-makers shooting on film, not video; an increasing degree of international crossovers, like Jeta Amata's Hollywood star-laden Niger-delta thriller <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/feb/01/jeta-amata-nollywood-s-gift-to-hollywood\" title=\"\">Black November</a>, Holly-Nolly co-production <a href=\"http://www.doctorbello.com\" title=\"\">Doctor Bello</a>, and the forthcoming Nigerian-UK adaptation of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie\" title=\"\">Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</a>'s novel <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2006/aug/19/fiction.shopping2\" title=\"\">Half of a Yellow Sun</a>; the slick looking streaming-video library <a href=\"http://irokotv.com\" title=\"\">iROKOtv</a> \u2013 supported by US money \u2013 giving ready access to Nollywood's bottomless bargain-bin of titles.</p> <p>At what point does a film industry become truly mainstream? If Tango with Me is the litmus test, I'd say Nollywood isn't there yet, aesthetically at least. It's not fully exploiting the virtues of the medium yet. The declarative dialogue, some of the riper acting from the bit-parters \u2013 they feel as though they're hand-me-downs from older art forms, like oral storytelling, that Nollywood has budded out of. Sometimes, I think you can still glean that kind of folk heritage in some 1940s and 50s Hollywood films, like when comedies occasionally forgot the ruthless plot focus of commercial cinema, and let their characters revert back to gratuitous knockabout japes that feel as though they belong on the stage. That slackened, carefree vibe certainly still appears in many Bollywood films, which are on a technically higher plane than current Nollywood.</p> <p>Those are the values of the commercial global mainstream, though. By another reckoning, Nollywood is already mainstream: the dominant industry of sub-Saharan Africa by virtue of pricing (dirt-cheap) and distribution (any means necessary, including piracy) arrangements in tune with Africa, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jul/10/tanzania-vjs-hollywood-africa\" title=\"\">where Hollywood has little or no official presence</a>. And with the hardwood moral messages and Christian values propagated by many Nigerian films, they have a consolidated sense of their audience's identity \u2013 the very meaning of mainstream. Tango with Me is no exception, and at the Q&amp;A, someone eagerly inquires what kind of Christian director Ali-Balogun happens to be. \"Born again,\" he says, proudly.</p> <p>But there's more than one mainstream in the world, and his eye is on the overlaps between them. \"What we are going through, Hollywood went through and Bollywood went through,\" is how he explains the process. Nollywood, if Ali-Balogun is correct, is about to born again, too.</p> <p>\u2022 Tango with Me is out on Friday. Next week's After Hollywood will focus on Dan Mintz, gatekeeper to the Chinese film industry for Hollywood. Meanwhile, what global box-office stories would you like to see covered in the column?

  "<p>The House of Commons' justice committee has called on the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) to make ICT an integral part of its business strategy so that it knows where to target improvements.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmjust/97/9702.htm\" title=\"\">report </a>on the MoJ's budget and structure, the committee says that at a time when funds are scarce, it is essential that the ministry can get the greatest benefit for minimum cost.</p> <p>It also recommends that it appoints a programme management leader for any future ICT projects, who will follow individual project from inception to implementation and be the senior responsible owner.</p> <p>One of the main achievements of the transforming justice programme has been the establishment of shared services centres, where corporate services are provided across the MoJ according to the committee.</p> <p>It urges the ministry to promote its shared service centres to other government departments, in order to gain additional income.</p> <p>Last year the MoJ signed a contract with Savvis to develop a shared services platform for finance, HR and payroll. It is waiting for that to be fully operational.</p> <p>Chris Pennell, principal analyst at Kable, said: \"The MoJ is in a transitional phase as it moves from its current shared services operations to a new model.</p> <p>\"It will need to ensure that the project remains on track and on budget, which is going to be challenging.\"</p> <p>As a result of the organisational complexity of the core department and its agencies, the MoJ has a wide number of ICT systems. In 2010-11 its budget for technology totalled \u00a3590m.</p> <p>In evidence to the committee, the Law Society pointed to a long history of underinvestment in court ICT. It said that it was difficult to evaluate the MoJ's use of IT because of the complex history of its IT, inheritance of legacy systems and the changing landscape of government ICT overall.</p> <p>The report says that the MoJ is aware that it needs to introduce new ways of working to help reduce its overall budget by 23% by 2014-15.</p> <p>It told the committee that over the next 3\u20135 years it intends to further reduce \"run and maintain\" ICT costs by more than \u00a3100m by replacing or renewing all major ICT contracts under its Future ICT Sourcing programme.</p> <p>\"In procuring by service tower we will standardise services across MoJ, making them much more economic,\" the ministry said.</p> <p>Pennell said: \"There have been several critical reports recently from the National Audit Office about the MoJ's case management systems, which pointed to a need for further investment.</p> <p>\"In addition, there is a lack of overall interoperability which needs to be addressed if these systems are to support the department in its drive to reduce budgets.\"</p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Berlin.</p> <p><strong>The lineup: </strong>Denitza Todorova (vocals, music).</p> <p><strong>The background: </strong>Dena appears to have emerged from the brain of a mildly satirical blogger. If you Google the phrase \"hipster clubber\" you get images of twentysomethings looking, even standing, <a href=\"http://jaggednoodles.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/hipsters21.jpg\" title=\"\">like her</a>. She's so now, or now-ish, that she appears to be critiquing the hipster mindset. You'd think she was from Brooklyn or Bethnal Green, not Bulgaria, although the fact that she has lived in Berlin since 2005 might explain why she has been attracting so much attention lately. That city's cool appears to have rubbed off on her.</p> <p>She's a singer, songwriter and musician, although obviously not in the sense of someone who picks up a guitar and strums a tune. She sang on the two albums by the Whitest Boy Alive, the side project of Erlend \u00d8ye from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOP37A1EhEs\" title=\"\">Kings of Convenience</a>, which because of their name we also assumed had parodic intentions. That air of ambiguity hangs over Dena's songs. Is she joking? It feels studied, but maybe we're saying that because she's done a lot of studying: visual and media studies, to be precise, in Berlin, where she also, she says, \"experimented with working with audiovisual techniques\". Next, she formed a synth duo with a female drummer inspired by 90s R&amp;B and hip-hop, after which she decided to go solo.</p> <p>She has been described as a cross between MIA and Jentina. We hadn't even heard of Jentina till we wrote that sentence but after rapid last-minute research it appears that Jentina was indeed doing this kind of thing seven years ago, with her track <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQym8L8pvqA&amp;feature=youtu.be\" title=\"\">Bad Ass Strippa</a>.</p> <p>Dena insists she's a \"very big fan of jazz\" and that her biggest idols are Sun Ra and J Dilla. \"I care about beats, I care about snare drums, deep chords, and lyrics,\" she says, but her songs are less forays into sampladelic avant-garde bop than exercises in hip-pop fun. That the \"fun\" seems to be in some way mediated is a matter of judgment. But the notion of someone being ironically detached is enhanced by Dena's single Cash, Diamond Rings, Swimming Pools. The title reminds us of Suicide's Diamonds, Fur Coat, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4BujbAqeTw\" title=\"\">Champagne</a>, which was irresistible even as you doubted whether Alan Vega loathed or wanted to join the jet set. Dena's song is equally murky with regard to her intent. What is the message being related over the jerky (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2009/feb/16/scene-and-heard-hyphy-house\" title=\"\">hyphy?</a>) rhythm? Is Dena playing a character, and if so, does the protagonist want the titular desirables, or is she condemning those who do as shallow? Maybe we're over-thinking it. Songs about money have been known to chart, albeit <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-P2qL3qkzk\" title=\"\">years ago</a>, as have <a href=\"http://rapgenius.com/Chipmunk-diamond-rings-lyrics\" title=\"\">ones about rings</a>, and there would even appear to be a current penchant for singing about <a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playListId=546531682\" title=\"\">swimming pools</a>. Cash, Diamond Rings, Swimming Pools conflates the three most covetable examples of bling and has the cartoon quality of a novelty: it could be a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN45OjB-cCU\" title=\"\">Jilted John</a> for MIA fans who'd like a little light relief from their favourite <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1678588/mia-super-bowl-middle-finger-halftime.jhtml\" title=\"\">Tamil Tiger apologist</a>.

  "<p>An Irish man who brought a civil claim against the owners of a cruise ship after he was the butt of jokes told by comedians on board two of its vessels has won an out-of-court payment.</p> <p>John Wolfe, 74, a retired builder from Dublin, claimed the jokes, which allegedly stereotyped Irish people, were deeply offensive and left him feeling humiliated. He complained to P&amp;O after he and his wife Joan were on board a worldwide cruise on the Oriana five years ago and brought a claim against Carnival Plc, the owners of the company.</p> <p>During the trip, he claimed that two comedians entertained passengers by telling a series of Irish jokes in their routines. After allegedly receiving reassurances from the company such jokes would be banned and the Wolfes were given \u00a31,000 of vouchers to spend, they were surprised and upset to hear similar jokes when they took another P&amp;O cruise in 2008 - to the Caribbean on board the Artemis.</p> <p>Wolfe brought a civil claim against Carnival Plc - the owners of P&amp;O - under race relations legislation as well as the European Union's race directive - a ruling which sets out the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin.</p> <p>The case was due to be heard at the Manchester Civil Justice centre but has been settled out of court.</p> <p>Wolfe, who represented himself during proceedings, said he couldn't comment on the settlement, but it is believed to be a five-figure sum. The claim that he had been a victim of racial discrimination was struck out by the court.</p> <p>At a hearing in May, District Judge Anthony Harrison said the case centred on whether Carnival was \"vicariously liable\" - that is, whether they were responsible for the actions of the comedians. Carnival argued that as the comedians were employed by a sub-contractor - and not directly by them - it is not responsible for the offensive jokes.</p> <p>The company also claims that as the alleged incidents took place outside UK waters, they do not fall under the jurisdiction of its laws. It argues that a settlement was reached with Wolfe following his first complaint and because he was given \u00a31,000 worth of vouchers, this effectively precluded him pursuing a further complaint.</p> <p>A P&amp;O spokesperson said: \"We can confirm that this case has been resolved amicably out of court to the satisfaction of both parties.\"</p>",

  "<p>\"I have just ... paid a depressing visit to an electronic computer which can write sonnets if fed with the right material,\" said Lawrence Durrell, at the session 50 years ago of which this is an echo. \" ... I have a feeling that by Christmas it will have written its first novel, and possibly by next Christmas novel sets will be on sale at Woolworths and you will all be able to buy them, and write your own.\"</p> <p>Notionally, the horror here is something to do with the denigration of human creativity. But Durrell is aghast in particular that these novel sets will be on sale at Woolworths - the tragedy, perhaps, might have been a little lessened if they'd been exclusive to Waitrose. </p> <p>It's not clear how scared he really was. Futures of anything tend to combine possibilities, desiderata, and dreaded outcomes, sometimes in one sentence. There's a feedback loop between soothsaying and the sooth said, analysis is bet and aspiration and warning. I want to plural, to discuss not the novel but novels, not the future, but futures. I'm an anguished optimist. None of the predictions here are impossible: some I even think are likely; most I broadly hope for; and one is a demand.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>A first hope: the English-language publishing sphere starts tentatively to revel in that half-recognised distinctness of non-English-language novels, and with their vanguard of Scandinavian thrillers, small presses, centres and prizes for translation, continue to gnaw at <a href=\"http://translationista.blogspot.co.uk/2011/09/three-percent-problem.html\">the 3% problem</a>, all striving against the still deeply inadequate but am-I-mad-to-think-improving-just-a-little profile of fiction translated into English. </p> <p>And translation is now crowdsourced, out of love. Obscure works of Russian avant-garde and <a href=\"http://www.schulzian.net/\">new translations of Bruno Schulz</a> are available to anyone with access to a computer. One future is of glacially slowly decreasing, but decreasing, parochialism.</p> <p>And those publishers of translated fiction are also conduits for suspicious-making foreign Modernism.<br> * * *</p> <p>What is literature, and what do we want from it? The former is a key question, which I'm going to duck. What do we want from it? Many things. One is an expression of something otherwise inexpressible. An ineffability, by which you don't at all have to be a person of faith to have your breath taken away. Jewish mysticism warns of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qliphoth\">qliphoth</a> - husks, entropic shells of psychic muck and detritus that encrust and obscure that numinous. As you can tell, I'm turning my attention to English fiction.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/06/paulo-coelho-james-joyce-ulysses\">Paulo Coelho's ill-judged Joyce-bashing</a> has made him a butt of scorn this week, but he's a safe target because, with books that multitask a little too openly as self-help manuals, he's not so clubbable. Unlike, say, Ian McEwan, who not-that-differently declared against <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/02/23/090223fa_fact_zalewski\">\"the dead hand of modernism\"</a>, for all the world as if the dominant literary mode in post-war England was <a href=\"http://english.rutgers.edu/faculty/facultyprofiles/973-adifferentlanguage.html\">Steinian experimentation</a> or some Albion <a href=\"http://www.nous.org.uk/oulipo.html\">Oulipo</a>, against which young Turks hold out with limpidly observed interiority, decodable metaphors, strained middle-class relationships and eternal truths of the human condition(TM).</p> <p>All the usual caveats: yes, there are admirable novels written according to such norms, and conversely there've always been writers playing with form, etcetera. But two things remain key.</p> <p>i) The culturally dominant strain of English novel has for years been what <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2008/nov/20/two-paths-for-the-novel/\">Zadie Smith called \"lyrical realism\"</a>: the remorseless prioritisation, with apologies for repeating my favourite heuristic, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/oct/17/science-fiction-china-mieville\">of recognition over estrangement</a>.</p> <p>ii) Today it is not quite qliphothic business as usual.</p> <p>After last year's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/17/booker-prize-populism-backfire\">Booker Middlebrowmaggedon</a>, this year's judges are far too polite to draw attention to their task, which is to salvage something. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2012/jul/25/man-booker-prize-2012-longlist-gallery\">they've not done badly</a>. Longlists are performances, and while it's appropriate to cavil about our excluded favourites, the list sends various messages rather well. Including that the Booker is rapproching with that so-called dead hand.</p> <p>There've been other wind-blown straws. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/23/christine-brooke-rose\">The muted, palpable recent shame when Christine Brooke-Rose died</a>, that this astonishing innovator was so overlooked in the country of her birth. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/may/08/whocaresaboutannquin\">Renewed interest in Ann Quin</a>. Excitement at the online archive <a href=\"http://www.ubu.com/\">Ubuweb</a>. With the internet has come proof that there are audiences way beyond the obvious.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>I really, really don't want to talk about genre, because I always really want to, and nerd-whines are boring. But a detente between litfic and its others is real. It's a clich\u00e9 to point out that generic tropes are infecting the mainstream, with a piling-up of various apocalypses by those guilty of literature. But on the other side, say, an extensive interview with Yinka Tutuola, son of the legendary Nigerian writer Amos Tutuola, about his father's work, is online not at any traditional outlet of the literati <a href=\"http://weirdfictionreview.com/2012/05/amos-tutuola-an-interview-with-yinka-tutuola-by-jeff-vandermeer/\">but at Weird Fiction Review</a>, a fabulous site that emerges, with brilliance and polymath gusto, out of genre traditions.</p> <p>It was a generic, science-fictional horror that oppressed Durrell, those fiction engines. He's not the only writer to have suffered this nightmare: the Automatic Novel Writing Machine crops up repeatedly in fiction as a sign of awful futurity. Given the fire, flood, uneasy dead and enormity on which one can draw, it's an underwhelmingly terrifying dystopia, a future in the despotic thrall of the autonovelator, but <em>apres nous le deluge</em> - writers would far rather suffer planetary catastrophe than deskilling, or a scab algorithm.</p> <p>* * * </p> <p>The machine is unbuilt. The past future of the novel did not lie in being digitally produced. As traumatically, it's being digitally distributed.</p> <p>We are, at last, leaving phase one of the ebook discussion, during which people could ritually invoke the 'smell of paper' as a call to cultural barricades. Some anxieties are tenacious: how will people know what a splendid person I am without a pelt of the right visible books on my walls, without the pretty qlippoth husks? A hopeful future: that our grandchildren will consider our hankering for erudition-d\u00e9cor a little needy.</p> <p>Early predictions for what digitality would do to the novel look pretty creaky, as the futures of the past always do. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_fiction\">hypertext novel</a>? A few interesting experiments. The enhanced ebook, with soundtrack and animation? A banal abomination.</p> <p>In fact what's becoming obvious - an intriguing counterpoint to the growth in experiment - is the tenacity of relatively traditional narrative-arc-shaped fiction. But you don't radically restructure how the novel's distributed and not have an impact on its form. Not only do we approach an era when absolutely no one who really doesn't want to pay for a book will have to, but one in which the digital availability of the text alters the relationship between reader, writer, and book. The text won't be closed.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>It never was, of course \u2013 think of the scrivener's edit, the monk's mashup \u2013 but it's going to be even less so. Anyone who wants to shove their hands into a book and grub about in its innards, add to and subtract from it, and pass it on, will, in this age of distributed text, be able to do so without much difficulty, and some are already starting.</p> <p>One response might be a rearguard clamping down, as in the punitive model of so-called antipiracy action. About which here I'll only say - as someone very keen to continue to make a living from writing - that it's disingenuous, hypocritical, ineffectual, misunderstands the polyvalent causes and effects of online sharing, is moribund, and complicit with toxicity.</p> <p>The Creators' Rights Alliance, with which my own trade union is associated, <a href=\"http://www.creatorsrights.org.uk/index.php?section=Manifesto+for+creators\">put out a manifesto</a> that ends with a chilling injunction:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>[A] fundamental part of this provision should involve education about intellectual property. ... All schoolchildren should be encouraged in the habit of using the \u00a9 symbol with their work, whether it be an essay or a musical composition.</p> <p>The concept behind copyright is so simple that a child can understand it:</p> <p>\"I made it: it's mine.\"'</p> </blockquote> <p>A collection of artists and activists advocating the neoliberalisation of children's minds. That is scandalous and stupid. The text is open. This should \u2013 could \u2013 be our chance to remember that it was never just us who made it, and it was never just ours.</p> <p>* * * </p> <p>The problem with emphasising the authorial voice, and the novel's survival, even in its new forms, even with a permeable membrane between text and reader, is that it's hard to do so without sounding as if one's indulging a kind of ahistorical Olympian simpering at the specialness of writers. That the novel is tenacious as a cockroach is morally neutral. We can hope for a good novel \u2013 created by whatever means \u2013 decry bad ones, and observe with a shrug that in total they endure. </p> <p>To love literature doesn't mean we have to aggrandise it or those who create it. That aggrandisement is undermined by the permeable text. Be ready for guerrilla editors. Just as precocious 14-year-olds brilliantly \u2013 or craply \u2013 remix albums and put them up online, people are starting to provide their own cuts of novels. In the future, asked if you've read the latest Ali Smith or Ghada Karmi, the response might be not yes or no, but \"which mix\", and why?</p> <p>We'll be writing as part of a collective. As we always were. And so might anyone else be.</p> <p>\"[Y]ou will all be able to buy them,\" Durrell says of those novel-writing kits, addressing not the other writers, who didn't need them, but the public, \"and write your own.\"</p> <p>That's a telling elision - he starts by kvetching about writing by machine, by no one, and segues instantly to doing so about writing by the public, by everyone. That's apocalypse. That, apparently, is a nightmare future.</p> <p>The worst anxiety is not that the interfering public will ruin your work if they muck about with it, or that they'll write a terrible novel, but that they'll improve it, or write a great one. And once in a rare while, some of them will. How wonderful that will be.</p> <p>You don't have to think that writing is lever-pulling, that anyone could have written Jane Eyre or Notebook of a Return to my Native Land to think that the model of writers as the Elect is at best wrong, at worst, a bit slanderous to everyone else. We piss and moan about the terrible quality of self-published books, as if slews of god-awful crap weren't professionally expensively published every year. </p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Of course there are contexts in which particular books become politically important, and writers who exhibit astonishing bravery in the face of oppression. For the most part we're not talking about that. What if most fiction - which, yes, we all do and should love - is at best moderately important? What if it's so vague and culturally dribblesome and so mediated by everything else, once the culture industry extrudes it through a writer-shaped nozzle, that our stentorious declarations about subversive literature are, mostly, kind of adorable?</p> <p>Stand down. The blurring of boundaries between writers, books, and readers, self-publishing, the fanfication of fiction, doesn't mean some people won't be better than others at the whole writing thing, or unable to pay their rent that way \u2013 it should, though, undermine that patina of specialness. Most of us aren't that special, and the underlining of that is a good thing, the start of a great future. In which we can maybe focus more on the books. Which might even rarely be special.</p> <p>One of the problems, we often hear, about online piracy, ebooks and their ephemeral-seeming invisible files, is that they 'devalue writing', that our work is increasingly undervalued. Well, yes. Just like the work of nurses, teachers, public transport staff, cleaners, social workers, which has been undervalued a vast amount more for a whole lot longer. We live in a world that grossly and violently undervalues the great majority of people in it.</p> <p>It's that hegemony of the market again. We've railed against it - as we should - for the last several days. There's a contingent relationship between book sales and literary merit, so we should totally break the pretence at a connection, because of our amplifying connection to everyone else, and orient future-ward with a demand.</p> <p>What if novelists and poets were to get a salary, the wage of a skilled worker?</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>This would only be an exaggeration of <a href=\"http://www.berlin.de/sen/kultur/foerderung/literatur/stipendien/index.en.html\">the national stipends already offered by some countries for some writers</a>. For the great majority of people who write, it would mean an improvement in their situation, an ability to write full-time. For a few it would mean an income cut, but you know what? It was a good run. And surely it's easily worth it to undermine the marketisation of literature for some kind of collectivity.</p> <p>But who decides who qualifies as a writer? Does it take one sonnet? Of what quality? Ten novels? 50,000 readers? Ten, but the right readers? God knows we shouldn't trust the state to make that kind of decision. So we should democratise that boisterous debate, as widely and vigorously as possible. It needn't be the mere caprice of taste. Which changes. And people are perfectly capable of judging as relevant and important literature for which they don't personally care. Mistakes will be made, sure, but will they really be worse than the philistine thuggery of the market?</p> <p>We couldn't bypass the state with this plan, though. So for the sake of literature, apart from any- and everything else, we'll have to take control of it, invert its priorities, democratise its structures, replace it with a system worth having.</p> <p>So an unresentful sense of writers as people among people, and a fidelity to literature, require political and economic transformation. For futures for novels \u2013 and everything else. In the context of which futures, who knows what politics, what styles and which contents, what relationships to what reconceived communities, which struggles to express what inexpressibles, what stories and anti-stories we will all strive and honourably fail to write, and maybe even one day succeed? </p> <p>\u2022 The <a href=\"http://www.edinburghworldwritersconference.org/\">Edinburgh World Writers' conference</a>, hosted jointly by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/edinburgh-book-festival\">Edinburgh International Book festival</a> and the British Council, runs from 17-21 August, with contributions from Ahdaf Soueif, Ali Smith, Irvine Welsh, China Mi\u00e9ville and Patrick Ness</p>",
  "<p><strong>1. How did you come to write </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780857864185/the-testament-of-jessie-lamb\" title=\"\"><strong>The Testament of Jessie Lamb</strong></a><strong>?</strong><br>There were three starting points: I wanted to write about a young woman who is heroic, and to explore what her heroism might mean to those around her; I wanted to explore the moment in a child's life when the child first seriously defies her parents and becomes an individual in her own right \u2013 and I wanted to explore that from both sides, the girl's and the parents', thinking about how loss of control over a child can seem appalling to a parent; and I had a sense of an icy cold place where something terrible, some abuse of scientific knowledge, was taking place. The strange cold place was not somewhere I know; I imagined a scientific research station maybe in the Arctic, somewhere very remote.</p> <p><strong>2. What was most difficult about it?</strong><br>Getting Jessie's voice right. She had to be convincing as a 16 year old, but I didn't want to use the actual language and speech mannerisms of a contemporary 16 year old, because it would drive me mad. At the time I was writing, a faithful rendition would have involved using \"like\" every second word. I was anxious about boring the reader with very young and simple language, and in early drafts I included sections from her father's point of view because I didn't trust Jessie's voice enough to carry the whole book. What helped me with the voice was rereading <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/history/9780141315188/the-diary-of-a-young-girl-definitive-edition\" title=\"\">the diary of Anne Frank</a>; Anne's bubbly, optimistic, joyous personality shines through her writing, even though she is in a very dark place. I tried to aim for something similar for Jessie.</p> <p><strong>3. What did you most enjoy?</strong><br>I applied for an Arts Council fellowship award to work on this book at the Banff Centre in Canada, citing as one of my reasons for applying that I needed to research a frozen landscape. I was there for 12 weeks in winter and it was stunningly beautiful. I was given a warm writer's cabin in snowy woods and didn't have to think about anything but the novel, and that really kickstarted it. The irony was that in the end I abandoned the icy research centre setting because I realised that Jessie needed to be living in a much more ordinary world. All the snow and ice of the Canadian Rockies was reduced in the novel to one rather cold bus ride through blue-ish evening snow in [Greater Manchester's] Ashton-under-Lyne. I hope that maybe there is still some of the whiteness and brightness from Banff in there somewhere though.</p> <p><strong>4. How long did it take?</strong><br>Five years. I rewrite endlessly. At one point it was more than double its current length.</p> <p><strong>5. What has changed for you since it was first published?</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.themanbookerprize.com/node/949\" title=\"\">The [2011] Booker longlisting</a>, and then the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/03/jane-rogers-arthur-c-clarke-2012\" title=\"\">Arthur C Clarke award</a>, have drawn it to people's attention and given it higher visibility than it first had. Which has been great, since it is now published in the States and Canada, with Korean, Japanese, German and hopefully other editions to follow.</p> <p><strong>6. Who's your favourite writer?</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fyodordostoevsky\" title=\"\">Fyodor Dostoevsky</a>.</p> <p><strong>7. What are your other inspirations?</strong><br>Place, and other writers, are my two greatest sources of ideas. For all my novels there is a place and particular atmosphere that feels like some kind of key (most clearly for me, Raasay in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780349112299/island\" title=\"\">Island</a>. For Jessie, it was Banff). Novels that were inspirational for Jessie Lamb include <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/philiproth\" title=\"\">Philip Roth</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780099771814/american-pastoral\" title=\"\">American Pastoral</a> (Swede's incomprehensible, rebellious daughter), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/kazuoishiguro\" title=\"\">Kazuo Ishiguro</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780571258093/never-let-me-go\" title=\"\">Never Let Me Go</a> (for the use of a parallel/future world, and the idea of self-sacrifice), and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/johnwyndham\" title=\"\">John Wyndham</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/science-fiction/9780141032979/the-chrysalids\" title=\"\">The Chrysalids</a> as a model of the type of book I wanted to write. For a brilliant plot template, I looked at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/euripides\" title=\"\">Euripides</a>' Iphigenia in Aulis, which is the same story \u2013 a young girl commits to an heroic act, against the wishes of her parents.</p> <p><strong>8. Give us a writing tip.</strong><br>When you can't write, write drivel. Some days you know that every word you write is crap, but if you write it anyway, there is something to cross out and improve on the next day.</p> <p><strong>9. What, if anything, would you do differently if you were starting the book again?</strong><br>I don't know. I'd find a way to write it faster, but since every novel apart from my second one has always taken me at least four years, I guess I have to accept that my method of writing too much and then carving a novel out of it is all I know how to do.</p> <p><strong>10. What are you working on now?</strong><br>Just putting the finishing touches to a collection of stories due out in the autumn.</p> <p>\u2022 The Testament of Jessie Lamb is published by Sandstone Press, \u00a37.99. Jane Rogers appears at the Edinburgh international book festival on 25 August</p>",

The second of four daughters, she lived with her mother Virginia in the Spanish Lake neighbourhood of St Louis, about two miles from the bridge. Julie was a volunteer for Amnesty International and Greenpeace, and her family and friends admired her for her strong sense of justice. She had a motto hanging on her bedroom wall: \u201cWho says you can't change the world?\u201d Her mother Ginna told police on the night of the incident: \u201cJulie is a very friendly, trusting and idealistic girl\u201d.</p> <p>Julie's overwhelming enthusiasm was for writing poetry and songs. As her cousin, Jeanine Cummins, puts it in her book about the tragedy, A Rip in Heaven: \u201cJulie was having a full-blown love affair with words. Her poetry was her passion; it helped her to interpret her life, to put things in perspective.\u201d It was poetry that brought Julie and her sister to the bridge that night \u2013 they wanted to show their cousin, Thomas Cummins, a poem Julie had written and that they'd painted on the bridge.</p> <p>Julie's body was found three weeks after she went missing, near Caruthersville, 297 miles downstream. She is buried in Calvary cemetery in St Louis.</p> </div>  <div id=\"gia-dp-bio-robin-kerry\"> <h2>Robin Kerry</h2> <p>A year younger than her sister Julie, Robin, 19 at the time of her death, was also studying at the University of Missouri-St Louis, in her case linguistics. She was active in the local community, helping six-year-olds with their homework after school at the local Salvation Army family haven. A strict vegetarian, her bedroom was festooned with sculptures she had made and sketches of dragons and fairies.</p> <p>Her cousin Jeanine Cummins wrote that \u201cRobin was bright and defiant. Julie was her mentor, her muse, but Robin was one hundred per cent her own person. She was the shier of the two sisters, but her quiet demeanor masked an ever active wellspring of activity in the mind. She was witty, sarcastic and passionate.\u201d The sisters' mother, Ginna, told police on the night they went missing that <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366824-22-police-record-91063187.html#document/p14/a59323\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">\u201cif there was a struggle, Robin would defend herself and sister and would fight to the death\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Robin's body has never been found.</p> </div>  <div id=\"gia-dp-bio-thomas-cummins\"> <h2>Thomas Cummins</h2> <p>The son of a Catholic deacon from Gaithersburg, Maryland, Tom Cummins was training to become a fire fighter when the Chain of Rocks tragedy occurred. Aged 19, he had travelled with his family to St Louis for the spring break to spend time with his cousin Julie. On the night of the 4 April he drove with Julie and her sister Robin to the bridge to see a poem that Julie had written and painted on it. After the women fell to their deaths, Cummins became the star witness in the prosecution case against Reggie Clemons and his two other black co-defendants. He testified in three separate trials that they had raped his cousins and pushed them into the river, then forced him to jump after them by threatening to shoot him.</p> <p>But police initially <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366803-26-cummins-booking-note-and-clearing.html#document/p1/a59316\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">considered Cummins the murderer</a>. Police records suggested that when they first encountered Cummins after he had sounded the alarm they were <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366824-22-police-record-91063187.html#document/p1/a59324\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">puzzled by his dry and neatly combed hair</a>. Records also show that <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p7/a58722\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">when he was questioned by detectives he changed his story several times</a>, at one point saying that Julie had stumbled into the river after he had unwittingly startled her by trying to hug her.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366803-26-cummins-booking-note-and-clearing.html#document/p1/a59317\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">Police dropped their investigation of Cummins</a> after they corroborated his statement that four other men had been on the bridge that night. Cummins later issued a lawsuit against the St Louis police alleging they had tried to frame him for the murders \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365271-10-tom-cummins-lawsuit.html#document/p11/a59285\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">beating him and then fabricating the police reports</a>  - and he received a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365265-7-clemons-writ2009.html#document/p3/a59197\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">settlement of $150,000</a>.</p> <p>Today he lives back in the north-east of the US.</p> </div>  <div id=\"gia-dp-bio-daniel-winfrey\"> <h2>Daniel Winfrey</h2> <p>Aged 15, Winfrey was the youngest of the group of four men accused of murdering the Kerry sisters on 4 April, and the only white person among them. He had moved to the small town of Wentzville outside St Louis just three weeks before the incident, where he became friendly with Marlin Gray.</p> <p>At just 5 ft 6 inches, he was described as an awkward teenager, though polite and respectful. He was arrested having been implicated by Thomas Cummins as one of the four perpetrators. After interrogation, he agreed to turn prosecution witness, confessing that he had been involved in robbing Cummins and the sisters and had held down the women but had not raped them. He gave evidence in court in the three separate trials of his co-defendants in exchange for a lesser charge of second-degree murder for which he pleaded guilty and received a 30-year sentence.</p> <p>Winfrey was a key witness for the prosecution whose testimony was crucial to the conviction of Reggie Clemons, testifying he had seen Clemons rape the sisters. By his own account, though, he was not on the bridge at the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p8/a58723\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">moment the Kerry sisters fell into the river</a>. He didn't <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p9/a58724\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">\u201cknow what happened down there\u201d and he \u201cnever saw what went on after [Cummins] was put in the hole\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Winfrey was released on parole in 2007. He now lives outside St Louis with his mother. When the Guardian visited him, he said: \u201cI have nothing to say. Talk to my lawyer.\u201d</p> </div>  <div id=\"gia-dp-bio-marlin-gray\"> <h2>Marlin Gray</h2> <p>Marlin Gray, 23 at the time, was the oldest of the four men accused of murdering the Kerry sisters. On the evening of 4 April he was driving around Wentzville when he spotted Daniel Winfrey who he had got to know shortly before, and the two of them went off to visit Gray's friend Reggie Clemons in St Louis.</p> <p>After the four were arrested, Winfrey told police that Gray had had the initial idea to go back on the bridge and accost the Kerry sisters and their cousin, alleging that Gray had said he <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365263-5-clemons-appeal-1996.html#document/p12/a58904\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">\u201cfelt like hurting someone\u201d</a>. Gray also made a confession to police, but shortly afterwards retracted it, saying <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365270-8-marlin-gray-clemency.html#document/p5/a59282\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">it had been beaten out of him</a>. Winfrey and Thomas Cummins testified at Gray's trial that he had raped the women. Cummins said that Gray had threatened to \u201cpop him\u201d. But by their account, Gray had left the bridge by the time the women were allegedly forced into the river and he was found guilty of murder as an accomplice. Gray continued to insist he was innocent until 26 October 2005 when he was executed by lethal injection. Before he died, he made a final statement. He said: <a href=\"http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/gray989.htm\">\"I go with a peace of mind that comes from never having taken a human life. This is not a death, it is a lynching.\u201d</a></p> </div>  <div id=\"gia-dp-bio-reggie-clemons\"> <h2>Reggie Clemons</h2> <p>Born on 30 August 1971, Clemons was the youngest of six children of Roosevelt and Vera Robinson (now Thomas). Clemons had a difficult childhood, suffering from abuse on the part of his father. Vera eventually divorced Roosevelt, and remarried a church pastor, Reynolds Thomas, when Clemons was six years old. Clemons's home background stabilised, and by the time of the Chain of Rocks incident, aged 19, he was described as a compassionate and caring teenager who <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p3/a58725\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">showed no inclination towards violence and had no previous criminal record</a>.</p> <p>Clemons was put on trial for the murder of the Kerry sisters on the basis of his own <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p5/a58727\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">confession to raping one of the women and on the testimony of Thomas Cummins and Daniel Winfrey</a>. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365260-3-clemons-internal-affairs.html#document/p11/a58868\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">Clemons complained two days after he had made the confession that it had been beaten out of him</a>.</p> <p>Cummins told the jury at the trial that he heard Clemons and Winfrey discussing whether he should be allowed to live or die. But neither Cummins nor Winfrey testified that they had seen Clemons push the women into the river, and the prosecution did not allege that he had done so, arguing he was an accomplice to murder.</p> <p>Clemons, who has consistently proclaimed his innocence, is being held at the Potosi Correctional Center in Missouri. He was sentenced to death on 18 February 1993 and has been on death row ever since.</p> </div>  <div id=\"gia-dp-bio-antonio-richardson\"> <h2>Antonio Richardson</h2> <p>Richardson lived around the corner from his cousin, Reggie Clemons, in a suburb of St Louis. Aged 16 at the time of his arrest, he was brought up by a succession of relatives and suffered periods of abandonment. By 15 he had a drug and alcohol problem, and dropped out of school.</p> <p>At trial, his lawyer presented the jury with evidence of Richardson's impaired mental capacity and brain damage. Richardson was the first of the four co-defendants to be arrested after police found a flashlight on the bridge that he had stolen and lost on the night of the murders. Under questioning, Richardson turned on Marlin Gray and Clemons, saying that they had killed the Kerry sisters. But at his trial Thomas Cummins, the sisters' cousin, said it was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365260-3-clemons-internal-affairs.html#document/p11/a58868\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">Richardson who pushed the women in and then ordered him to jump after them</a>.</p> <p>In July 1993 Richardson was found guilty of murder, but the jury was unable to decide whether or not he should be given the death penalty. In their place, the trial judge put him on death row. He came within an hour of execution in March 2001, and two years later had his <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365264-6-clemons-cert.html#document/p18/a59196\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">death sentence commuted to life imprisonment with no chance of parole</a>.

Photograph: KRT/Newscom/Jeanine Cummins</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KRT/Newscom/Jeanine Cummins</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Poetry brought Julie and Robin Kerry to the Chain of Rocks bridge on that terrible night. Julie had written a poem on the theme of anti-racism which she called Do The Right Thing, borrowing the title of Spike Lee's film.</p> <p>United We Stand<br>Divided We Fall<br>It's Not a Black-White Thing<br>We as a New Generation<br>Have got To Take a Stand<br>Unite as One<br>We've got II<br>STOP<br>Killing One Another</p> <p>A couple of months before they sisters were killed, Julie, Robin and their friend Holly McClain went on to the bridge and painted the poem in large white letters over a 20-metre span. They signed it with the peace symbol and Julie's pet name, Jules.</p> <p>\"She wanted to show the poem to Tom because she was really proud of it,\" McClain recalls, referring to Thomas Cummins, the cousin of the Kerry sisters who was visiting them at the time at their home in Spanish Lake, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri.</p> <p>McClain spoke to the Guardian, giving her first public comments about her friend Julie Kerry since she died. She said that she herself had almost gone onto the bridge that night but had turned back at the last minute because she was accompanied by a marine who didn't want to be seen trespassing on private property.</p> <p>McClain says they had chosen the poem Do The Right Thing to paint on the bridge because of its theme calling for unity and an end to racism. \"We were dealing a lot with that at the time. We decided we wanted to say something about us \u2013 that showed who we were, so that's how we came to write what we did.\"</p> <p>More than two decades after she drowned, McClain is still palpably affected by the loss of her friend. \"There are so many things about Julie that are important to remember,\" she says. \"She was a beautiful person. But she wasn't perfect \u2013 she was human.</p> <p>\"She tried really hard to do right in every way that she could, she was a loving person and I miss her a lot. I think my life would have been different had I never known her, and it's certainly different because she isn't here.</p> <p>\"She was imaginative, she was creative. She was a poet and a songwriter. And she wanted to save the world.\"</p> <p>Julie Kerry was 20 when she died, studying English literature at college. She devoured all sorts of poetry and ballads, from Chaucer to Sinead O'Connor. She and McClain volunteered for numerous causes together, working with groups on HIV and Aids and joining charity walks for the homeless.</p> <p>Robin was equally passionate about social justice. The Christmas before they died, the sisters were so moved by a feature in the St Louis-Post Dispatch about needy families in the city that they announced they were each going to help out. In a matter of days they raised $600 and delivered several car loads of food and Christmas gifts to two of the families.</p> <p>If Julie was a poet, Robin, a year younger, was a fighter. In her book A Rip In Heaven: a Memoir of Murder, Jeanine Cummins, a cousin of the sisters, recounts the story of how Robin dealt with a bully at her school who was picking on another pupil. \"She simply could not stand by while this jerk tormented the little guy day after day. She slammed her locker, marched over to the bully, and punched him in the jaw.\"</p> <p>At the sisters' funeral, mourners were given a scroll as mementos. Printed on it were words taken from the bedroom walls of Robin and Julie. \"Give to the world the best you have and the best will come back to you\"; \"Let the Christians of the world agree that they will not kill each other\"; \"If love comes from the heart, where does hate come from? Let's not teach our children hatred and prejudice\"; and Julie's own personal mantra: \"Who says you can't change the world.\"</p> <p>McClain stressed that Julie Kerry was a member of Amnesty International and a staunch opponent of the death penalty. \"She was against death row. She felt strongly \u2013 she was against it.\"</p> <p>Asked by the Guardian what she thought should happen to Reggie Clemons, bearing in mind the Kerry sisters' position on the death sentence, McClain declined to comment. All she would say was: \"When it's all said and done, God's going to handle it.\"</p>",

The second of four daughters, she lived with her mother Virginia in the Spanish Lake neighbourhood of St Louis, about two miles from the bridge. Julie was a volunteer for Amnesty International and Greenpeace, and her family and friends admired her for her strong sense of justice. She had a motto hanging on her bedroom wall: \u201cWho says you can't change the world?\u201d Her mother Ginna told police on the night of the incident: \u201cJulie is a very friendly, trusting and idealistic girl\u201d.</p> <p>Julie's overwhelming enthusiasm was for writing poetry and songs. As her cousin, Jeanine Cummins, puts it in her book about the tragedy, A Rip in Heaven: \u201cJulie was having a full-blown love affair with words. Her poetry was her passion; it helped her to interpret her life, to put things in perspective.\u201d It was poetry that brought Julie and her sister to the bridge that night \u2013 they wanted to show their cousin, Thomas Cummins, a poem Julie had written and that they'd painted on the bridge.</p> <p>Julie's body was found three weeks after she went missing, near Caruthersville, 297 miles downstream. She is buried in Calvary cemetery in St Louis.</p> </div>  <div id=\"gia-dp-bio-robin-kerry\"> <h2>Robin Kerry</h2> <p>A year younger than her sister Julie, Robin, 19 at the time of her death, was also studying at the University of Missouri-St Louis, in her case linguistics. She was active in the local community, helping six-year-olds with their homework after school at the local Salvation Army family haven. A strict vegetarian, her bedroom was festooned with sculptures she had made and sketches of dragons and fairies.</p> <p>Her cousin Jeanine Cummins wrote that \u201cRobin was bright and defiant. Julie was her mentor, her muse, but Robin was one hundred per cent her own person. She was the shier of the two sisters, but her quiet demeanor masked an ever active wellspring of activity in the mind. She was witty, sarcastic and passionate.\u201d The sisters' mother, Ginna, told police on the night they went missing that <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366824-22-police-record-91063187.html#document/p14/a59323\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">\u201cif there was a struggle, Robin would defend herself and sister and would fight to the death\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Robin's body has never been found.</p> </div>  <div id=\"gia-dp-bio-thomas-cummins\"> <h2>Thomas Cummins</h2> <p>The son of a Catholic deacon from Gaithersburg, Maryland, Tom Cummins was training to become a fire fighter when the Chain of Rocks tragedy occurred. Aged 19, he had travelled with his family to St Louis for the spring break to spend time with his cousin Julie. On the night of the 4 April he drove with Julie and her sister Robin to the bridge to see a poem that Julie had written and painted on it. After the women fell to their deaths, Cummins became the star witness in the prosecution case against Reggie Clemons and his two other black co-defendants. He testified in three separate trials that they had raped his cousins and pushed them into the river, then forced him to jump after them by threatening to shoot him.</p> <p>But police initially <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366803-26-cummins-booking-note-and-clearing.html#document/p1/a59316\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">considered Cummins the murderer</a>. Police records suggested that when they first encountered Cummins after he had sounded the alarm they were <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366824-22-police-record-91063187.html#document/p1/a59324\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">puzzled by his dry and neatly combed hair</a>. Records also show that <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p7/a58722\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">when he was questioned by detectives he changed his story several times</a>, at one point saying that Julie had stumbled into the river after he had unwittingly startled her by trying to hug her.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366803-26-cummins-booking-note-and-clearing.html#document/p1/a59317\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">Police dropped their investigation of Cummins</a> after they corroborated his statement that four other men had been on the bridge that night. Cummins later issued a lawsuit against the St Louis police alleging they had tried to frame him for the murders \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365271-10-tom-cummins-lawsuit.html#document/p11/a59285\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">beating him and then fabricating the police reports</a>  - and he received a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365265-7-clemons-writ2009.html#document/p3/a59197\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">settlement of $150,000</a>.</p> <p>Today he lives back in the north-east of the US.</p> </div>  <div id=\"gia-dp-bio-daniel-winfrey\"> <h2>Daniel Winfrey</h2> <p>Aged 15, Winfrey was the youngest of the group of four men accused of murdering the Kerry sisters on 4 April, and the only white person among them. He had moved to the small town of Wentzville outside St Louis just three weeks before the incident, where he became friendly with Marlin Gray.</p> <p>At just 5 ft 6 inches, he was described as an awkward teenager, though polite and respectful. He was arrested having been implicated by Thomas Cummins as one of the four perpetrators. After interrogation, he agreed to turn prosecution witness, confessing that he had been involved in robbing Cummins and the sisters and had held down the women but had not raped them. He gave evidence in court in the three separate trials of his co-defendants in exchange for a lesser charge of second-degree murder for which he pleaded guilty and received a 30-year sentence.</p> <p>Winfrey was a key witness for the prosecution whose testimony was crucial to the conviction of Reggie Clemons, testifying he had seen Clemons rape the sisters. By his own account, though, he was not on the bridge at the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p8/a58723\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">moment the Kerry sisters fell into the river</a>. He didn't <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p9/a58724\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">\u201cknow what happened down there\u201d and he \u201cnever saw what went on after [Cummins] was put in the hole\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Winfrey was released on parole in 2007. He now lives outside St Louis with his mother. When the Guardian visited him, he said: \u201cI have nothing to say. Talk to my lawyer.\u201d</p> </div>  <div id=\"gia-dp-bio-marlin-gray\"> <h2>Marlin Gray</h2> <p>Marlin Gray, 23 at the time, was the oldest of the four men accused of murdering the Kerry sisters. On the evening of 4 April he was driving around Wentzville when he spotted Daniel Winfrey who he had got to know shortly before, and the two of them went off to visit Gray's friend Reggie Clemons in St Louis.</p> <p>After the four were arrested, Winfrey told police that Gray had had the initial idea to go back on the bridge and accost the Kerry sisters and their cousin, alleging that Gray had said he <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365263-5-clemons-appeal-1996.html#document/p12/a58904\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">\u201cfelt like hurting someone\u201d</a>. Gray also made a confession to police, but shortly afterwards retracted it, saying <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365270-8-marlin-gray-clemency.html#document/p5/a59282\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">it had been beaten out of him</a>. Winfrey and Thomas Cummins testified at Gray's trial that he had raped the women. Cummins said that Gray had threatened to \u201cpop him\u201d. But by their account, Gray had left the bridge by the time the women were allegedly forced into the river and he was found guilty of murder as an accomplice. Gray continued to insist he was innocent until 26 October 2005 when he was executed by lethal injection. Before he died, he made a final statement. He said: <a href=\"http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/gray989.htm\">\"I go with a peace of mind that comes from never having taken a human life. This is not a death, it is a lynching.\u201d</a></p> </div>  <div id=\"gia-dp-bio-reggie-clemons\"> <h2>Reggie Clemons</h2> <p>Born on 30 August 1971, Clemons was the youngest of six children of Roosevelt and Vera Robinson (now Thomas). Clemons had a difficult childhood, suffering from abuse on the part of his father. Vera eventually divorced Roosevelt, and remarried a church pastor, Reynolds Thomas, when Clemons was six years old. Clemons's home background stabilised, and by the time of the Chain of Rocks incident, aged 19, he was described as a compassionate and caring teenager who <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p3/a58725\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">showed no inclination towards violence and had no previous criminal record</a>.</p> <p>Clemons was put on trial for the murder of the Kerry sisters on the basis of his own <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p5/a58727\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">confession to raping one of the women and on the testimony of Thomas Cummins and Daniel Winfrey</a>. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365260-3-clemons-internal-affairs.html#document/p11/a58868\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">Clemons complained two days after he had made the confession that it had been beaten out of him</a>.</p> <p>Cummins told the jury at the trial that he heard Clemons and Winfrey discussing whether he should be allowed to live or die. But neither Cummins nor Winfrey testified that they had seen Clemons push the women into the river, and the prosecution did not allege that he had done so, arguing he was an accomplice to murder.</p> <p>Clemons, who has consistently proclaimed his innocence, is being held at the Potosi Correctional Center in Missouri. He was sentenced to death on 18 February 1993 and has been on death row ever since.</p> </div>  <div id=\"gia-dp-bio-antonio-richardson\"> <h2>Antonio Richardson</h2> <p>Richardson lived around the corner from his cousin, Reggie Clemons, in a suburb of St Louis. Aged 16 at the time of his arrest, he was brought up by a succession of relatives and suffered periods of abandonment. By 15 he had a drug and alcohol problem, and dropped out of school.</p> <p>At trial, his lawyer presented the jury with evidence of Richardson's impaired mental capacity and brain damage. Richardson was the first of the four co-defendants to be arrested after police found a flashlight on the bridge that he had stolen and lost on the night of the murders. Under questioning, Richardson turned on Marlin Gray and Clemons, saying that they had killed the Kerry sisters. But at his trial Thomas Cummins, the sisters' cousin, said it was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365260-3-clemons-internal-affairs.html#document/p11/a58868\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">Richardson who pushed the women in and then ordered him to jump after them</a>.</p> <p>In July 1993 Richardson was found guilty of murder, but the jury was unable to decide whether or not he should be given the death penalty. In their place, the trial judge put him on death row. He came within an hour of execution in March 2001, and two years later had his <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365264-6-clemons-cert.html#document/p18/a59196\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">death sentence commuted to life imprisonment with no chance of parole</a>.

After 19 years on death row in Missouri for the murder of two young women, he has been granted a final opportunity to persuade a judge that he should be spared execution by lethal injection.</p> <p>Next month, Clemons will be brought before a court presided over by a \"special master\", who will review the case one last time. The hearing will be unprecedented in its remit, but at its core will be a simple issue: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/aug/21/death-penalty-murder-mississippi-video\">should Reggie Clemons live or die?</a></p> <p>That question is as deadly serious as it sounds. One of Clemons's three co-defendants has already been executed, and Clemons himself came within 12 days of being put to death in 2009.</p> <p>The Reggie Clemons case has been a cause of legal dispute for the past two decades. Prosecutors alleged that he and his co-defendants brutally cut short the lives of Julie and Robin Kerry, sisters who had just started college and had their whole adult lives ahead of them.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/400902-us-appeals-court-denial.html#document/p4/a64879\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">The Missouri prosecutors' case against Clemons</a>, based partly on incriminating testimony given by his co-defendants, was that Clemons was part of a group of four youths who accosted the sisters on the Chain of Rocks Bridge one dark night in April 1991. The bridge, that connects Missouri and Illinois over the Mississippi river, had fallen into disuse, and teenagers used to gather up there to meet, smoke dope or do graffiti. The sisters, and their cousin Thomas Cummins, had gone onto the bridge that night to see a poem Julie Kerry had painted on it, and as they did so they bumped into Clemons and three other young men who were hanging out there.</p> <p>The prosecution case was that the men forced the sisters to strip, threw their clothes over the bridge, then raped them and participated in forcing them to jump into the river to their deaths. As he walked off the bridge, Clemons was alleged to have said: \"We threw them off. Let's go.\"</p> <p>Clemons's supporters have over the years given a different rendition of events. In the racially heated atmosphere of St Louis in the early 1990s, they say, Clemons was made the fall guy. Of the four men who were charged with the murders, the three black men were all put on death row while the one white man is now free on parole.</p> <p>In this account of events, the cards were stacked against Clemons from the beginning. His appeal lawyers have <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365265-7-clemons-writ2009.html#document/p2/a64882\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">argued that he was physically beaten into making a confession</a>, the jury was wrongfully selected and misdirected, and his conviction largely achieved on individual testimony with no supporting forensic evidence presented.</p> <p>Next month's proceedings will bring these two versions of events head<br>to head. The hearing will be unique in US legal history in terms of<br>the open-ended brief that has been assigned to the special master,<br>appointed by the Missouri supreme court after a federal judge granted<br>Clemons a stay of execution three years ago. The position was given<br>the title of special master to denote the unusual legal challenge it<br>involved. The judge would given full powers to call witnesses, look<br>through the evidence and eventually recommend to the supreme court<br>what should happen to Clemons.</p> <p>The hearings will also be significant in a wider sense: in effect, the<br>death penalty in America will itself be put on trial when the hearing<br>opens on 17 September.</p> <p>Judge Michael Manners will be confronted by a question that goes to the heart of the debate on capital punishment in America today. Is the legal system so foolproof, so devoid of flaws and inconsistencies, that it can \u2013 beyond the shadow of even the slightest doubt \u2013 impose the ultimate, irreversible punishment: the taking of a man's life?</p> <p>At the end of what is expected to be a week-long hearing, Manners will draw up his recommendation to the Missouri supreme court that will seal Clemons's fate. The judge will have the full range of options open to him. He could recommend that Clemons be freed on time served; order a new trial; call for his death sentence to be commuted to life without parole; or suggest that a date be set for Clemons to be executed \u2013 this time with no chance of reprieve.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396351174\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/8/8/1344439625671/Reggie-Clemons-St-Louis-M-004.jpg\" alt=\"Reggie Clemons, St Louis, Missouri\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reggie Clemons. Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clemons is not allowing his hopes to rise ahead of the hearing. He has been through many twists and turns in his legal fortunes already. At one point an appeal court overturned his death sentence, only for it to be reimposed by another judicial panel. After so many years, he has acquired a degree of emotional detachment.</p> <p>\"When dealing with the courts, you learn not to have expectations,\" he said in a Guardian interview from death row at Potosi Correctional Center in Missouri. \"After 20 years of contemplating my execution, and contemplating my death, I have accepted it.\"</p> <p>The burden of proof at the special hearing will fall on the defence. In other words, it will be for Clemons and his lawyers to convince the judge that his death sentence for double murder is unsound.</p> <p>To do that, the defence is expected to concentrate on Clemons's confession to police detectives after he was arrested on suspicion of being involved in the murder of the Kerry sisters, who drowned in the Mississippi river on the night of 4-5 April 1991. Clemons confessed to raping Robin Kerry, but immediately retracted the statement, insisting it had been beaten out of him during a violent police interrogation.</p> <p>Lawyers on both sides of the legal argument are declining to speak before the hearing. But it is understood that new evidence will be presented to the hearing that supports Clemons's case that his confession was coerced and should not have been allowed to be put before the jury at trial. The Missouri prosecutors are expected in reply to argue that a coerced confession is not proof of Clemons's innocence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396351175\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/8/8/1344438494300/The-Chain-of-Rocks-bridge-008.jpg\" alt=\"The Chain of Rocks bridge in St Louis\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Chain of Rocks bridge in St Louis. Photograph: Laurence Topham for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The state's star witness at the trial of Reggie Clemons was Thomas Cummins, the cousin of the Kerry sisters. Cummins told the jury that on the night his cousins were murdered, Cummins and the two sisters had been accosted on the deserted Chain of Rocks bridge by four men they encountered there. The sisters were raped and pushed into the river, Cummins said, then he was forced to jump in after them.</p> <p>Cummins's account was initially doubted by police, and they suspected him of causing his cousins' death. At Clemons's ensuing trial, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366829-23-water-chief.html#document/p24/a62802\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">an officer of the Missouri state water patrol raised doubts</a> that anyone could survive a 70ft drop from the bridge into the perilously fast-moving waters of the Mississippi without at least suffering some visible injuries.</p> <p>Cummins told police several different accounts of what happened that night, according to police records. One of the accounts was that Julie Kerry had <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365265-7-clemons-writ2009.html#document/p14/a62800\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">stumbled into the water by accident</a> after he tried to hug her. But Cummins retracted his statement, saying he had been roughly treated during many hours of interrogation, and later was granted $150,000 by St Louis police <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365265-7-clemons-writ2009.html#document/p3/a59197\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">to settle a claim for police mistreatment</a>.</p> <p>A couple of days after the sisters' deaths, police dropped Cummins as a suspect and turned their attentions instead to the other four men who had been on the bridge that night. They were: Clemons; Marlin Gray (executed in 2005); Antonio Richardson (currently serving life imprisonment after his death sentence was commuted); and Daniel Winfrey (the only white man among the four, who turned witness for the prosecution and was given a deal under which he received a lesser sentence; he was released in 2007 on parole).</p> <p>After several hours of questioning by St Louis police, Clemons confessed to rape but not to murder. But the next day he, too, retracted the confession, saying it had been beaten out of him.</p> <p>\"I remember police mainly beating me in the chest, and that was something that scared me a whole lot. While they were beating me, they were telling me what they wanted me to admit to,\" Clemons told the Guardian.</p> <p>As Clemons's lawyers have argued, his description of the violent interrogation he was put through is almost identical to that alleged by Thomas Cummins. It took place, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365265-7-clemons-writ2009.html#document/p3/a62799\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">according to the complaints of both men</a>, at the hands of the same detectives, in the same investigation and within 48 hours of each other .</p> <p>Cummins was given a $150,000 settlement, and was made the star witness at Reggie Clemons's trial. Clemons, by contrast, had his allegedly coerced confession presented to the jury and used as key evidence to put him on death row.</p> <p>The other area of legal argument that is likely to be central at next month's hearing will focus on a rape kit that was collected after Julie Kerry's body was found 297 miles downstream from the bridge. The rape kit, which is in cold storage with the St Louis police department, appears not to have been disclosed to Clemons's lawyers before his trial.</p> <p>Jeanene Moenckmeier, one of Clemons's two original trial lawyers, told the Guardian that \"we should have seen it as part of the evidence we could have considered at the trial.\"</p> <p>DNA tests have recently been carried out on the rape kit, and on a condom found on the bridge that night, to see whether they can illuminate what happened 19 years ago. The results of those tests are being studied by the Missouri attorney general's office and Clemons's current defence lawyers, and are likely to be the subject of testimony in front of the special master.</p> <p>What, if anything, the tests show, and whether they can cast any light on what happened on the bridge 19 years ago \u2013 and indeed Clemons's role in events \u2013 will only become clear at next month's proceedings.</p> <p>There are several other aspects of the case that could hold the special master's attention. The prosecution of Reggie Clemons was so riddled by inconsistencies and irregularities that some observers of the case argue he should never have been put on death row in the first place.</p> <p>\"There are so many contradictions, so many things that don't add up,\" said Chris King, editorial director of the St Louis American, that has covered the case in depth over several years. \"In capital cases the highest standards of jurisprudence should be observed \u2013 because the state is taking a life \u2013 but that didn't happen in this case.\"</p> <p>The selection of the trial jury was conducted by the prosecution in a way <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p13/a58716\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">that was later ruled unconstitutional</a>. Questions were also raised about the way the prosecution had been conducted. At the time of the Chain of Rocks bridge, Clemons was 19, had just finished high school and was planning to go to college to study engineering. Yet despite the fact that Clemons had no criminal record, the chief prosecutor Nels Moss went in front of the jury and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/365258-1-clemens-clemency.html#document/p16/a58718\" class=\"gia-dc-inline\">compared him to the serial killer Charles Manson</a>. Moss had been instructed by the trial judge not to refer to Manson - he had played the same trick in the earlier trial of Marlin Gray - and for blatantly disregarding the order was later fined $500 for criminal contempt of court.</p> <p>Two sets of people will be touched particularly intimately by the outcome of the hearing. The first is Clemons's family, particularly his mother Vera Thomas, who has visited him on death row every week almost without fail for the past 19 years.</p> <p>\"Every time I visit him I am more aware of the fact that they are trying to kill him. It's like we're living on borrowed time, as far as the system is concerned,\" she said.</p> <p>The second set of people is the family of Julie and Robin Kerry. They prefer not to speak in public about what happened to their loved ones, and declined to participate with the Guardian.</p> <p>The closest indication of the family's thinking is given in a powerful book written by the Kerry sisters' cousin, Jeanine Cummins, Thomas Cummins' sister. In A Rip In Heaven she writes movingly about the emotional rollercoaster that her family has been on over many years.</p> <p>She says she has no compassion for Reggie Clemons or his co-defendants. \"I don't care what happens to them. Julie and Robin aren't coming back.\"</p> <p>Jeanine Cummins has strong words, too, about the death penalty. She writes that Julie and Robin were both adamantly opposed to the death sentence on humanitarian grounds. Cummins herself gives a different reason for wanting the death penalty to be abolished \u2013 because it further alienates and tortures families such as hers who have already suffered so much.</p> <p>\"Maybe the death penalty is wrong \u2026 because it rubs salt in the wounds of grief,\" she writes. \"Because it trivialises the people who should matter most. Because it allows the murderers the opportunity to wear a badge they don't deserve \u2013 the badge of the victim.\"</p>",
  "<p>India's highest court is due to hear a case that could decide whether cut-price generic drugs for cancer and other serious conditions will continue to be available in much of the developing world.</p> <p>The long-running case, which resumes in Delhi on Wednesday, has been brought by the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis. It wants an Indian patent for its leukaemia drug imatinib mesylate, which has been patented as Glivec in nearly 40 countries including China, Russia, Mexico, Taiwan, Germany and the UK, and Gleevec in the US.</p> <p>Novartis says the legal move is \"about protecting intellectual property to advance the practice of medicine, not about changing access to medicines\", according to Ranjit Shahani, the vice-chairman and managing director of Novartis India. But campaigners argue that a victory for Novartis could result in the deaths of thousands of people who will no longer be able to afford the drugs they need.</p> <p>\"It would quite simply be a death sentence for us,\" said Vikas Ahuja, who was diagnosed with HIV in 1993 and is now the president of the Delhi Network of Positive People. \"I am quite sure that if Novartis wins, other multinationals will follow suit and other drugs will become prohibitively expensive.\"</p> <p>M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) believes the ramifications of a Novartis win would be felt beyond India's borders. \"If Novartis won the case, patents would be granted in India as broadly as they are in wealthy countries and on new formulations of known medicines already in use,\" <a href=\"http://www.msfaccess.org/content/qa-patents-india-and-novartis-case\" title=\"\">MSF says in a Q&amp;A on its website</a>.</p> <p>\"India would no longer be able to supply much of the developing world with quality affordable medicines \u2026 More and more treatments will remain priced out of reach for the duration of the patent term \u2013 20 years or more \u2013 including those that are merely new forms of existing medicine and didn't deserve a patent in the first place.\"</p> <p>Indian generic medicines are among <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/jul/26/pharmaceutical-companies-health-worlds-poor-risk\" title=\"\">the cheapest in the world</a>, largely because India did not issue patents on drugs until 2005 after coming under pressure from the World Trade Organisation. Its size also means it has the production capacity to manufacture reliable and safe copies of branded medicines.</p> <p>As a result, India now makes one-fifth of the world's generics, such as antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV and Aids. About half are sent abroad, mostly to other developing countries.</p> <p>Even if Novartis wins, generic versions of Glivec will still be available in India because it came on the market before 2005 and is protected under a so-called \"grandfather clause\" in Indian patent law, said Shahani.</p> <p>This week's supreme court case is the final chapter in a legal spat that has rumbled on since 2006, when Novartis first tried and failed to patent Glivec. At that time, the drug was sold at \u00a31,650 per patient per month in countries where Novartis had obtained a patent. In India, generic versions of Glivec were available for less than \u00a3127 per patient per month in 2006.</p> <p>The patent office in Chennai rejected the claim on the grounds that the drug was not sufficiently new, but a slightly modified update of an older medicine. When India finally introduced a patent law seven years ago, it included a clause which decreed that \"patentability\" shall be granted only if pharmaceutical companies can prove \"enhanced efficacy\".</p> <p>This legal provision aims to stop firms from seeking patents or extensions based on minor changes to existing treatments \u2013 a practice known as \"evergreening\" that is common in Europe and the US. The clause has allowed India to reject patents for a range of older drugs for cancer, Aids, tuberculosis, malaria and other illnesses that are made by India's generics industry.</p> <p>Given India's own poverty \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3013870.ece\" title=\"\">30% of the population earn less than 32p a day</a> \u2013 many argue the limits still make sense domestically, particularly as Indian patients bear at least 80% of their own medical costs. Branded and patented drugs are often 10 to 40 times more expensive than generics.</p> <p>Shahani said Novartis had brought the case to clarify India's investment environment. \"Knowing we can rely on patents in India benefits government, industry and patients because research-based organisations will know if investing in the development of better medicines for India is a viable long-term option,\" he said in an email on Tuesday.</p> <p>\"As one of the largest manufacturers of generic medicines in the world, Novartis understands the role played by legitimate generics and recognises that access to medicines is a far more complicated issue involving lack of diagnosis, infrastructure and distribution and goes beyond just making generic drugs available,\" Shahani argued.</p> <p>\"Without patents there will be no new drugs and without new drugs there will be no new generics. Governments, NGOs and companies need to work together to find innovative solutions to these issues.\"</p> <p>But those whose lives depend on affordable drugs are not reassured. \"Why do pharmaceutical companies spend so much on research that they can only make drugs rich people can afford?\" said Ahuja, whose organisation is party to the supreme court case, along with the Indian government and the Cancer Patients Aid Association.</p> <p>\"If they are only going to serve a certain class of people, they should say so in their advertising, rather than pretending to be so altruistic.\"</p>",
  "<p>Having swapped Oxford for Harvard some years back, the neo-imperialist (his term) historian Niall Ferguson <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/9061577/Historian-Niall-Ferguson-Why-I-am-quitting-Britain-for-intellectual-America.html\" title=\"\">recently observed</a> that he appreciates the US more than the UK because the \"quality of intellectual life \u2026 is so much higher\". He is now finding out just how much the intellectual life of his chosen country appreciates him.</p> <p>In a forthright cover story for Newsweek magazine entitled <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/08/19/niall-ferguson-on-why-barack-obama-needs-to-go.html\" title=\"\">Hit the Road, Barack</a>, Ferguson argues that Obama has broken almost all of his campaign promises of four years ago, and attacks the US president's foreign policy, healthcare reforms and economic and fiscal policy.</p> <p>To say that commentators in the US have criticised the piece would be an understatement. Nor is it Ferguson's political views they object to (the Glasgow-born historian was an adviser to Obama's 2008 Republican rival, John McCain). Rather, and somewhat embarrassingly, they dispute the accuracy of his facts and the logic of his argument.</p> <p>\"We are not talking about ideology or even economic analysis here,\" writes the Nobel prize-winning economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, with whom Ferguson has had several previous run-ins, \"just a plain misrepresentation of the facts.\" Krugman accuses Ferguson of \"unethical commentary\" and \"deliberately misleading readers\", and suggests Newsweek should print an \"abject correction\" of one particularly \"cheap shot\" on healthcare reform.</p> <p>Ferguson has since responded in a <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/20/newsweek-cover-rebuttal-paul-krugman-is-wrong.html\" title=\"\">post</a> for the Newsweek-owned Daily Beast website, with typical vim (\"You know you have hit the target when Paul Krugman takes time out from his hiking holiday\"). But Krugman is far from being the only leading US commentator to take issue with his broadside.</p> <p>Among a raft of other \"intellectual fouls\", US commentators accuse Ferguson of blaming Obama for job losses that happened before he even took office; citing unverifiable figures from undisclosed sources; confusing basic economic ratios such as debt-to-GDP and debt-to-revenue; getting both the facts and the economics wrong when referring to US banks' capital adequacy and misrepresenting the budgetary implications of Obamacare.</p> <p>In the Atlantic, James Fallows \u2013 a Harvard alumnus \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/08/as-a-harvard-alum-i-apologize/261308/\" title=\"\">apologises on behalf of his alma mater</a>, saying Ferguson's story \"is so careless and unconvincing that I wonder how he will presume to sit in judgment of the next set of student papers he has to grade\".</p> <p>Describing Ferguson as \"embarrassingly bad\" and accusing him of lying, Brad DeLong, a widely read University of California Berkeley economist, <a href=\"http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2012/08/more-lies-from-niall-ferguson.html\" title=\"\">recommends</a>: \"Fire his ass. Fire his ass from Newsweek, and the Daily Beast. Convene a committee at Harvard to examine whether he has the moral character to teach at a university. There is a limit, somewhere.

  "<p>Fewer than half the people thought to have dementia have been formally diagnosed, and those with a diagnosis may have waited up to a year for it to have their condition confirmed. These are the startling reminders published in the all-party parliamentary group on dementia's latest report, <a href=\"http://alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/download_info.php?downloadID=873\" title=\"\">Unlocking diagnosis</a>.</p> <p>Most of us will experience someone close to us living with dementia. There are approximately 800,000 suffering in the UK and two-thirds of people with the condition living in the community. Given the housing sector's vital neighbourhood role, do housing providers have a responsibility to increase this rate of diagnosis?</p> <p>The Alzheimer's Society certainly thinks so. Its report, <a href=\"http://alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=1913\" title=\"\">Home truths</a>, highlighted the lack of focus on housing and dementia and recognised the importance of trained housing staff, who understand dementia and can support families by providing information and advice on local services and housing options.</p> <p>With the financial cost of dementia to the UK already reaching \u00a323bn and local authority resources tightening as care needs increase, it is hardly surprising that half of people with dementia and their carers report they are not receiving sufficient support and care. Evidence from people with dementia and their carers suggests access to information and advice is patchy at best.</p> <p>Housing providers are already doing a lot to help people with dementia live independently by ensuring their communities and housing are dementia-friendly. Good housing and related services play a vital role in improving the lives of people with dementia and helping them stay in their own home, which in turn helps to reduce the ever-increasing costs to health and social care.</p> <p>Housing with care helps people with dementia to live in the community, delaying a move into a care home. Beechwood Court, an extra care scheme recently opened by <a href=\"http://www.willowhousing.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Willow Housing and Care</a>, has care workers and scheme managers trained in dementia awareness and incorporates aspects of dementia-friendly design to help people with dementia continue living independently in the scheme.</p> <p>Housing-related care and support, as well as home adaptations and telecare services, reduce the pressure on acute services such as accident and emergency departments. Rochdale Boroughwide Housing operates an assistive technology service to help tenants with dementia live independently. Fall detectors and lifting cushions have reduced the frequency of paramedic call-outs and A&amp;E admissions, amounting in estimated savings of \u00a3392,288 a year.</p> <p>The nature of the dementia challenge means it cannot be met by specific care and support services alone. Housing staff working in general needs accommodation are helping to increase the rate of diagnosis and signposting to packages of support.</p> <p>Riverside Housing Association runs a health check service for older tenants called <a href=\"http://www.riverside.org.uk/national/find_a_home/independent_living/livetime.aspx\" title=\"\">LiveTime</a>. The service has encountered a number of cases of people living with dementia, resulting in specialist training for staff. The service has helped to get some people a diagnosis of dementia through contact with their families, GPs and social services. Elsewhere, the Accord Group has worked with local partners such as Age UK Walsall to set up an information service with trained dementia advisers to advise people with dementia, as well as providing a dementia cafe for people to access information on diagnosis and available support.</p> <p>To raise the profile of housing in meeting the needs of people living with dementia, the National Housing Federation has set up a dementia and housing working group with the Department of Communities and Local Government. In rising to the prime minister's dementia challenge, we hope that the champion groups taking forward the dementia strategy will tighten the connections between dementia and housing, demonstrating a clear understanding of what housing services people with dementia need and when, and a national evidence base to show the real impact of these services.</p> <p>We want to see better information and advice on both care and housing options for people with dementia, their families and their carers, as well as accessible dementia training for housing staff working on the frontline.</p> <p>The government must lead the way in meeting this challenge. Though the responsibility to build truly dementia-friendly communities and neighbourhoods lies not just with government, but with all parts of society \u2013 housing providers included.</p> <p><em>Amy Swan is a policy officer at the </em><a href=\"http://www.housing.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>National Housing Federation</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and the latest job vacancies direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>Westminster will be working itself into a familiar frenzy when David Cameron embarks on his first substantive ministerial reshuffle early next month.</p> <p>Downing Street knows that the excitement of new faces walking to No 10 for their first cabinet meeting will be a complete irrelevance if the government is perceived to have failed in the area that always decides elections: the economy.</p> <p>Labour says the government has done just that: Rachel Reeves, the shadow Treasury chief secretary, describes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/21/uk-public-finances-deficit-borrowing\" title=\"\">the increased government borrowing figures</a> as a \"damning indictment of a chancellor\" who has delivered a double-dip recession leading to \"soaring borrowing\".</p> <p>The Treasury played down the significance of the figures as it blamed a cut in North Sea oil production for most of the fall in corporation tax receipts, necessitating the increased borrowing.</p> <p>But there are deep nerves in Whitehall that George Osborne is reaching the stage where voters will make an irrevocable judgment that he has failed to deliver his two key economic pledges made during the 2010 election. These were to stabilise the public finances and to preside over an economic recovery led by a rejuvenated private sector.</p> <p>In both these areas Osborne is unlikely to be able to claim success by the time of the next election. He has already admitted failure in the first area when he announced in last November's autumn statement that he would not meet his target, set out in his emergency budget of June 2010, to eliminate the structural budget deficit by the time of the next election.</p> <p>The chancellor is also struggling to deliver his second pledge \u2013 an economic recovery spearheaded by the private sector, which was meant to pick up the slack as public spending was cut. The double-dip recession indicates that the public spending cuts may have sucked demand out of the economy at such a pace that private growth has been stifled.</p> <p>A key moment for Osborne will come when he delivers his autumn statement in November. The chancellor has little room for manoeuvre because he played his trump card last year \u2013 reminding voters that his deficit reduction plan is an aspiration and not a fixed target. His fiscal mandate has been dubbed Osborne's \"ever flexible friend\" because the target for assessing the deficit is judged on a rolling five-year basis. This means that a definitive judgment never needs to be made.</p> <p>Osborne may, as he did last year, announce that he is extending the period of spending cuts without breaking his mandate. Had Osborne stood by his initial informal target to eliminate the structural budget deficit by the time of the next election, he would have had to impose punitive spending cuts and tax increases.</p> <p>Unease over the government's economic policy is creating some unlikely bedfellows. Vince Cable and Boris Johnson are the most senior figures in the two coalition parties to raise concerns about the lack of a growth strategy.</p> <p>In a leaked letter in March, Cable warned of an absence of \"a compelling vision of where the country is heading beyond sorting out the fiscal mess\". Johnson recently called on Cameron to stop \"pussyfooting around\" and support a new airport for London, highlighting concerns among many Tories about the failure of the government to acknowledge the significance of large infrastructure projects.</p> <p>Some Liberal Democrats are concerned that Osborne has stumbled because he thought the key economic tool was what he calls active monetary policy. The Lib Dems fully support an active monetary policy because they agree that focusing too much attention on fiscal policy as a way of stimulating the economy through spending is largely to blame for the parlous state of the public finances.</p> <p>But the Lib Dems fear that Osborne may have laid the grounds for the current lack of a growth strategy by believing, initially at least, that monetary policy is the only tool. Lurking in the background is Osborne's belief that low taxes are the best way of creating a vibrant economy.</p> <p>No doubt the debate over tax and spending in the US presidential election may come into play over here. <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/18/to-obama-republican-budget-plans-are-snake-oil/\" title=\"\">President Barack Obama has described the Romney-Ryan proposals for tax cuts as \"snake oil\".</a> The president said: \"They've been trying to sell this trickle-down snake oil before.\"</p>",
  "<p>The extent of police intelligence records about people who have not been charged or convicted of any crime has been revealed under the Freedom of Information Act.</p> <p>The disclosures show that around 14m Metropolitan police intelligence reports and 38m from other forces, gathered routinely because they may prove useful, are being made available to all of Britain's police agencies on the Police National Database (PND). Figures obtained by the Guardian show the PND \u2013 in 2011 \u2013 contains at least 317.2m records.</p> <p>The Met intelligence files includes details about protesters who have attended demonstrations, unconvicted \"persons of interest\", associates of criminals, including lists of phone numbers stored on perpetrators' phones, allegations of crimes, and victims of sexual or domestic abuse. The database also contains almost 40,000 images.</p> <p>Police argue that sharing intelligence on the database speeds up investigations, helping identify new patterns of crime. But civil liberties groups are concerned that it can criminalise innocent people.</p> <p>The revelation has prompted calls for more police transparency about what kind of information about unconvicted people is being logged and shared.</p> <p>\"This has a profound impact on privacy and basic rule of law,\" said Guy Herbert, general secretary of <a href=\"http://www.no2id.net/\" title=\"\">NO2ID</a>. \"If something is 'intelligence' it is by definition composed of guesswork, speculation and hearsay. It has the capacity to criminalise the innocent and affect people's lives in all sorts of ways if they get flagged as 'of interest' to the police.\"</p> <p>Before being entered on to the PND, Met intelligence records are entered on a Scotland Yard database named Crimint Plus, described as \"the largest law enforcement intelligence system in the world\" by former Met detective chief inspector Peter Ship. An estimated 2,000 reports are entered every day on Crimint, which was established in 1994 and since 2005 has doubled in size. Most Crimint intelligence records are stored for a minimum of six years in accordance with police data retention policy. They are accessible by around 40,000 Met employees, plus up to 12,000 from 65 forces and agencies across Britain through the PND \u2013 though some information deemed sensitive is held more securely and cannot be accessed by all users.</p> <p>Managed by the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA), the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/jun/22/childrensservices.politics1\" title=\"\">PND was introduced following recommendations from the Bichard inquiry</a> into police failings prior to the Soham murders in 2002. The agency, which is expected to hand over control of the PND to the new <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/police/police-it/\" title=\"\">police ICT company</a> soon, has acknowledged that the system could contain information on up to 15m people \u2013 one in four of all Britons. According to the <a href=\"http://www.policeauthority.org/Metropolitan/committees/sop/2009/091203/13/index.html\" title=\"\">Metropolitan Police Authority website</a>, intelligence gathering \"may appear to be only for organised crime or counter-terrorism work, but it is actually often a more routine matter in the MPS. It could be described as simply 'capturing information while carrying out one activity which is likely to prove useful in a future policing activity'.\"</p> <p>A Met spokesman said the force gathered information lawfully and within strict guidelines, but was \"not prepared to discuss specific aspects relating to intelligence\".</p> <p>An NPIA spokesman said: \"Each individual police force as the data owner will decide what information is stored on the PND. The public has a right to expect the police to share intelligence information to prevent and detect crime and to protect our communities. Under the Data Protection Act, individuals can access information about them that is held on the PND.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 Are you on the Police National Database without a criminal record? </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/21/police-national-database-your-stories\" title=\"Has your information been shared on the database?\"><em>Share your story here</em></a></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 22 August 2012.

  "<p>At an African Union summit meeting in January, Meles Zenawi, the taciturn Ethiopian prime minister, made a <a href=\"http://au.int/en/summit/18thsummit/speeches/remarks-he-ato-meles-zenawi-prime-ministre-federal-democratic-republic-ethiopia-\" title=\"\">terse, punchy speech, expressing his admiration for China</a>.</p> <p>Meles, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/21/ethiopia-meles-zenawi-dies-illneses\" title=\"\">whose death was announced</a> on Tuesday by the Ethiopian government, spoke of China's \"amazing re-emergence\" and its important role in Africa's renaissance. The Ethiopian strongman's lavish praise of China owed much to the occasion \u2013 the inauguration of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/jan/27/constructive-criticism-intra-african-trade\" title=\"\">swanky African Union headquarters donated by Chinese labour and money</a> at a cost of $200m.</p> <p>But his admiration for China, coupled with an attack on \"market fundamentalist\" ideas that he said had wrecked African economies, was heartfelt. Under his long rule \u2013 since the overthrow of Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991, Meles has dominated Ethiopian politics \u2013 Ethiopia has pursued a top-down model of development, much like China.</p> <p>The result has been impressive economic growth. Ethiopia has achieved annual economic growth of more than 7% for the past decade. As a result of rising agricultural output, officials expect economic growth of 11% for the 2011-12 fiscal year that ended in June, although inflation remains stubbornly high, hitting 20% in July.</p> <p>Ethiopia's strong economic record and stability in the volatile Horn of Africa have made it a magnet for donors. Over the past year alone, USAid, the US agency for international development, has given Ethiopia \u2013 considered a key American ally \u2013 $675m in aid, and Britain's Department for International Development (DfID) will spend <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/ethiopia\" title=\"\">an average of \u00a3331m a year there until 2015</a>.</p> <p>\"Since it came to power in 1991, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EDRDF) has consolidated a capable government that is demonstrably committed to addressing poverty \u2013 with an impressive record of pro-poor spending, sound financial management and a strong commitment to fight corruption,\" says DfID.</p> <p>Ethiopia, however, remains one of the world's poorest countries, with around 25 million out of a population of 85 million living in extreme poverty. Still, Meles won praise for his leadership. Bill Clinton, the former US president, said Meles was part of a \"new generation\" of African leaders, and he was invited to join Tony Blair's <a href=\"http://www.commissionforafrica.info/\" title=\"\">Commission for Africa</a>.</p> <p>Gordon Brown, the UK's former prime minister, was fulsome in his praise of Meles. \"Ethiopia, one of the poorest countries in the world, made more progress in education, health and economic development under his leadership than at any time in its history, and it is a tragedy for the Ethiopian people that they have lost a committed leader and a champion of children at such a young age,\" he said. \"When I last saw him earlier this year we held meetings about how we would ensure every child would be in school in Ethiopia by 2015. His passion was in abolishing poverty and our hope is that he will inspire a new generation of men and women who will champion the cause of eradicating poverty.\"</p> <p>But although Meles won plaudits for his economic record, the government's intolerance of dissent earned it criticism from human rights groups and the UN, and poses <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/feb/03/ethiopia-human-rights-questions\" title=\"\">awkward questions for aid donors</a>. In July, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18825538\" title=\"\">Eskinder Nega, a prominent journalist and blogger, was sentenced to 18 years in prison</a>, and an opposition activist, Andualem Arage, was given a life sentence for breaking anti-terrorism laws.</p> <p>Other journalists have been charged under the same sweeping anti-terrorism law that was introduced in 2009, prompting Navi Pillay, the UN high commissioner of human rights, to say journalists, human rights defenders and critics were facing a \"climate of intimidation\" in Ethiopia.</p> <p>The Ethiopian government's authoritarianism has puzzled observers, as Meles faced no viable opposition following a disputed parliamentary election in 2005. After violent demonstrations, in which 200 protesters were killed, Ethiopia rounded up almost the entire leadership of an opposition group that won all 23 seats in Addis Ababa and jailed them for life for treason.</p> <p>Since then, the political opposition has been toothless; many of its leading figures have given up and gone abroad. Civil society has effectively been strangled under a 2009 NGO law. The law prohibits human rights organisations in Ethiopia from receiving more than 10% of their funding from foreign sources \u2013 effectively shutting down human rights groups, since they cannot survive without substantial foreign funding.</p> <p>In legislative elections in 2010, Ethiopia's ruling party and its allies won virtually all the parliamentary seats, leaving the opposition with only two, in a result that embarrassed the regime. European observers said the election fell short of international standards.</p> <p>DfID has acknowledged Ethiopia's democratic deficit, even while it disburses large amounts of aid. \"Ethiopia has made some progress toward establishing a functioning democracy, but there is a long way to go,\" said DfID in its <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/publications1/op/ethiopia-2011.pdf\" title=\"\">2011-15 operational plan for Ethiopia</a>. \"The UK government continues to raise concerns about limitations on civil and political rights and the longer term sustainability of Ethiopia's tightly controlled political model.\"</p> <p>Such concerns are likely to be acute after Meles's sudden death. As Dr Adekeye Adebajo, executive director of the Centre for Conflict Resolution in Cape Town, South Africa, recently noted, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/08/meles-zenawi-profile-ethiopia-prime-minister\" title=\"\">Meles dominated domestic politics to the extent that a power vacuum on his departure seems certain</a>. With that in mind, it is unlikely that the succession will be smooth.</p>",
  "<p>A lawyer for Pussy Riot has warned that three members of the feminist punk band <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/17/pussy-riot-sentenced-prison-putin\" title=\"\">sentenced to jail last week</a> could face violence and discrimination because of the intense state campaign against them.</p> <p>\"For half a year, state-run television has built up a very negative image of them \u2013 that they're blasphemers, heretics,\" said Nikolai Polozov, a member of the women's defence team. \"The only source of information in prisons is state-run TV.</p> <p>\"We have a serious basis to think they can be faced with physical harm, moral pressure and even violence.\"</p> <p>Maria Alyokhina, 24, Yekaterina Samutsevich, 30, and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 22, were found guilty last week of hooliganism motivated by religious hatred for a February performance in Moscow's official cathedral criticising Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>Polozov said he would appeal against their sentence \u2013 two years in a minimum security prison colony \u2013 within two weeks.</p> <p>Alyokhina has already protested against the band's treatment. In a letter handed to Polozov from the detention centre in southern Moscow where they have spent the past five months, she described how prison officials and special forces troops had treated them harshly. \"I found this strange, usually they're not so rude with us, so that means they've got an order,\" she wrote. \"I want to believe that all will end well, but everything that's happening points to it being otherwise.\"</p> <p>Russian opposition activists remain enraged by the sentencing. On Tuesday, hackers attacked the site of the Khamovnichesky court, which hosted the trial against the three women, peppering it with slogans decrying Russia's justice system. The hackers also defaced the site's main page with a video by Azis, a gay Bulgarian singer.</p> <p>As well as exposing the Kremlin's crackdown on dissent, the trial has also shone a spotlight on its increasingly conservative policies, encouraged by the Russian Orthodox church, including repressive anti-gay laws.</p> <p>The trial has prompted criticism from some of Putin's closest allies. Yet many government supporters continue to promote the theory that Pussy Riot was part of a western plot to weaken Russia.</p> <p>\"It seems that the planned and well-orchestrated provocation called 'Pussy Riot' succeeded,\" Vladimir Yakunin, the Kremlin-connected head of Russian Railways and a high-profile supporter of the Orthodox church, wrote this week. The group, he said, was organised in response to growing Orthodox unity.</p> <p>\"As a person, I feel sorry for these young women and it's unfortunate that our law enforcement system did not find those who directed this performance, financed it and are now trying to get political dividends from it.\"</p> <p>Police are searching for other members of Pussy Riot who they believe were involved in the February performance of an anti-Putin \"punk prayer\" at Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour.</p> <p>\"The necessary search operations are being conducted,\" a representative of the Moscow police told the Interfax news agency.</p> <p>The source did not detail how many people they were looking for.</p>",
  "<p>I am a man from south London, 22 years of age and determined to make a change. I've had a very shady history and my addiction almost destroyed my life. It saw me under-achieving in school, it perverted my moral compass, it resulted in the deaths of many of my peers, and the list goes on. You've probably put me in the bracket of a former drug addict, or an alcoholic.</p> <p>But my addiction was to gang culture. And like so many addictions it started out as nothing more than a pastime: recreational, it was a way to socialise with other boys. It started fairly innocently, throwing eggs at windows and playing knock down ginger, then progressed to shootings, gang rivalry and dealing drugs. I know that sounds a big jump, and I'm not for a second saying that everyone who throws a few eggs will grow up to become a gang member. I'm just trying to illustrate how innocently it starts for so many, including myself.</p> <p>By 18, I was addicted to the lifestyle of being a gangster. The money, the power and the status it gave me among young men on my estate in Brixton. The downside was that I had been shot at more times than I've had birthday parties, I'd been cut on my face, almost blinded, and butchered in my back. I was living life every day with a pool of negative ambition perverting my potential. My prospects were getting bleaker and bleaker, until a courageous woman on my estate whose son was also a member of my gang opened her home to me and several others who were caught in the net she called gangsterism.</p> <p>Her name was Pastor Mimi and she ran a local church in the area. She never condemned us. She acknowledged that we were lost children who needed direction. Her home became our refuge; she would engage with us, counsel us, and helped us to identify that our true enemy was not our rivals from another estate but the ideology of gangsterism. This did not happen overnight. It took, time, effort, love and a strategy. She sparked a small flame of change in us that she fanned over a two-year period by challenging and dethroning the notion of gangsterism in our minds. The six of us who lived in the house and underwent her treatment have all been reformed. We are trying to help others in our community who are where we've been. In doing so, we're becoming assets, not liabilities, to society.</p> <p>For some that would be the happy ending, but for us it is only the beginning. There are clinics for rehabilitating drug addicts, alcoholics, and even sex addictions. Like any addiction, those who are addicted can see that the lifestyle they are leading is self-destructing but are almost powerless to change their circumstances. We now possess a formula that has been proven to help young men who are addicted to being in gangs.</p> <p>The rehabilitation model developed by Pastor Mimi is that of a therapeutic community rehabilitation centre. It is a unique and effective way of dealing with gangs. The police are doing their job arresting gang members who break the law but gang-related crime is still a major issue because the ideology remains unchallenged. So much taxpayers' money is used to incarcerate youths convicted of gang-related crimes. But prison is not the solution. A fraction of the money spent on detaining young people for gang crime could be used instead to set up a centre to rehabilitate them by mirroring the process I underwent under Pastor Mimi's roof.</p> <p>On Wednesday night, Pastor Mimi and I are taking the first step to setting up the first gang rehabilitation centre in the UK. I was chosen as the August winner of <a href=\"http://aroomforlondon.co.uk/ideas-for-london/aug-2012-london-gang-rehabilitation\" title=\"\">Ideas for London</a>, an Artangel competition in association with the London Evening Standard, which has given me the opportunity to host a dinner with politicians, community leaders and youth justice experts in order to put together a plan of action. A gang rehabilitation centre is a necessary and overdue step towards ending the epidemic of gangs on our streets.</p> <p>\u2022 Karl Lokko is a community champion and a youth ambassador at Kids Company.

  "<p>Li Wei, 18 (not her real name), doesn't seem like a dissident. She is more focused on her accounting studies, her friends on the social networks and chatting with her sister. Nevertheless, she took part in a demonstration last month in front of the Chinese Communist party offices that degenerated into violent clashes with police.</p> <p>The demonstrators gathered at dawn in Qidong, a small coastal town north of Shanghai. By noon, the local government headquarters were occupied and files were being thrown out of the windows. In the heat of the moment the party secretary's shirt was ripped off. \"We have to get mobilised to protect the environment, it's our home town,\" explained Li, from her parents' restaurant.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/03/china-anti-pollution-protest-copper\" title=\"\">Protests against pollution</a> have multiplied in China as people become better informed and more concerned about the heavy ecological cost of economic development. Even state media now stresses the environment is a priority for China. Young people use micro-blogging to pass on the word. \"People understand that the fight against pollution is a personal right, for there are very few places in the world where industrialisation has had such a massive and direct impact on such a large number of people,\" said environmental activist Ma Jun.</p> <p>Earlier this summer there were student-led protests against a copper alloy plant in Shifang, central Sichuan province. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/03/chinese-cancels-copper-plant-protests\" title=\"\">local authorities quickly scrapped the project</a>. In August 2011 a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/aug/14/china-protest-against-px-chemical-plant\" title=\"\">similar protest broke out in the industrial port of Dalian</a> in the north-east, which mobilised 12,000 people. The authorities gave way there too.</p> <p>In Qidong, locals were protesting against plans by a Japanese-owned paper mill to build a wastewater pipeline close to a small port. \"Many people earn a living from fishing here. That project jeopardised their livelihoods,\" said Li. She had learned about it on an internet forum and felt she had to do something. \"Protecting the environment is our generation's responsibility, we have a better understanding about these issues.\"</p> <p>Oji, the plant's owners, had stated that the waste would be treated before being discharged into the sea but the locals are sceptical, convinced that they are not being told the truth about the extent of the pollution \u2013 let alone the outcome of the demonstrations. The local hospital reported that a dozen people were treated for light wounds, but rumours say that three people were killed in the clashes.</p> <p>The government is concerned by these demonstrations. An editorial in the <a href=\"http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/\" title=\"\">People's Daily</a>, the communist party organ, stated that \"the public is rapidly becoming aware of environmental issues and its rights\", and went on to accuse local governments of failing to consult the people in such cases, but without suggesting any real alternatives.</p> <p>According to Yang Guobin, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania who researches environmental activism, the government's response was typical of the Chinese leadership in President <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hu-jintao\" title=\"\">Hu Jintao</a>'s era. \"The government's response is typical of their '<em>wei wen</em>' approach [the policy of maintaining stability at all costs] and stopping any widescale demonstrations, by force if necessary. But should state coercion fail, the government will immediately make some concessions to prevent the movement from escalating. In all cases, it acts fast,\" summed up Yang.</p> <p>Li Wei regrets that the protest degenerated. \"It went too far, the local government offices suffered a great deal of damage. That's a waste, because the government's money is the people's money.\"</p> <p>But it was difficult for people to co-ordinate better. Official requests to hold the protest were turned down and the only environmental NGOs countenanced by the government are tolerated precisely because they steer clear of any confrontation. \"In future we will have to find a mechanism for consultation between the various parties concerned prior to any new industrial project,\" said Ma, the environmental activist.</p> <p>At the crossroads in the centre of Qidong, news of the people's victory was splashed across a massive advertising screen, where the government statement announced that the wastewater project was to be abandoned. Nevertheless, the government bussed in anti-riot police from around the province, just in case.</p> <p>Thousands of blue-uniformed police were stationed in the city while the khaki-clad armed police units in helmets and wielding truncheons, blocked all the streets in the centre. For Li, who had never taken part in a demonstration before, this was a reality check. Not because of the local police intervention \u2013 she heard Qidong police slipping in the occasional \"<em>jia you!</em>\" (go on!), an expression more commonly used to encourage athletes \u2013 but the ensuing state repression.</p> <p>\"They pulled us by the hair. They slapped one girl in the face,\" she exclaimed, before switching to English: \"I really wanted to say to them, 'Fuck you!'\"</p> <p>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/\" title=\"\">Le Monde</a></p>",
  "<p>Almost a fifth of all comments posted on the Guardian website are about football. To celebrate the wit, knowledge and absurdity of our readers \u2013 and as an experiment \u2013 here is a small collection of the best comments posted over the opening weekend of the Premier League. Let us know if you think this is a good idea</p> <h2>1. Everton's form picks up early</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17809178\">Sheedysleftpeg</a></strong>:</p> <blockquote> <p>I've just woken up with this cracking hangover and have been having this mad dream all night that we played magnificently, could have had three goals but beat United 1-0! I've got to ring the boss, say I won't be in and get the paper to check what date it is. Is it January already?</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17805741\">Damien</a></strong>:</p> <blockquote> <p>If Everton have decided to skip their usual start of season collapse and have instead started playing well from the first game then we're all doomed. DOOMED!!!! (unless you're an Everton fan I guess).</p> </blockquote> <h2>2. Liverpool's poor start puts pressure on Brendan Rodgers</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17787782\">TN23</a></strong>:</p> <blockquote> <p>He should not have been so highly praised as a revolutionary coach. His time at Reading was hopeless and at Watford it was decent but not any more impressive than Malky Mackay or Sean Dyche. He was a tad fortunate to get the Swansea job. Yes, he put the finishing touch on a strong Championship team and got the team to compete. Although they were not the amazingly successful newly promoted side some have made them out to be \u2013 they were merely decent in the Premier League. The foundations had been laid by Martinez and Sousa. I don't think Rodgers was the right appointment. Martinez would have been better. We should not expect a Rodgers revolution at Liverpool.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17788247\">5durban5</a></strong>: </p> <blockquote> <p>Alan Hansen is absolutely right about Rodgers' tactics and formations. On corners he has no player outside or close to the outside of the box. West Brom scored twice from corners when the ball came outside the box and West Brom players were free to shoot with little contention from Liverpool's players. You would think a manager would have recognised the problem after the first goal and changed things. </p> <p>Rodgers looks like a debutant and his post-match comments are just awful. Saying that Liverpool should look forward to more of these types of losses is just bizarre. Losing to midtable or relegation-fighting teams cannot be something a club like Liverpool should be accepting. Bringing in midtable talent is not going to make Liverpool better, no matter how long it takes. Just won't happen.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17767266\">nansikom</a></strong>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Good result for West Brom but I have to say I had a bit of a feeling beforehand that we might get this result. I think West Brom have probably made the better appointment as a manager. Despite never having been head coach, Steve Clarke has a top reputation as a coach within the game and fits straight into West Brom's system of a director of football and a head coach. As far as tactics were concerned, he won the game easily: strong defence, get the ball out quickly, press Liverpool on the ball and don't give them time and space to play \u2013 it looked like Roy Hodgson MkII but with a far more potent attack, which I suspect is going to give us Baggies fans some serious goals and entertainment this season. </p> <p>This is where the match was really won. Liverpool continued their game of great approach and wasted chances from last season, while we took our chances when we got them. That's how you win football matches.</p> <p>I would be concerned at the way that Liverpool heads visibly dropped after the penalty. Isn't this supposed to be a new Liverpool? The body language was not good at only 2-0, with something to play for. After the second penalty went in, frankly, Liverpool had no response. Not a good sign, and Rodgers didn't seem to have a Plan B to change it around beyond \"bring on Carroll to throw himself around and hope something happens\". It's a mug's game predicting the season based on the first game but nevertheless I'll stand by my pre-season prediction that Liverpool are going to struggle this year.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17790641\">MrTreeMonkey</a></strong>:</p> <blockquote> <p>After watching Luis Su\u00e1rez for Liverpool and Uruguay I've come to the conclusion that if he could finish half as well or as often as he complains, Liverpool would be top four comfortably and Uruguay would have been into the quarter-finals at least at the Olympics. He's a puzzle because he's fantastic up until he can see the net. (Queue a long list of times Su\u00e1rez has scored in reply...)</p> </blockquote> <h2>3.

He has been a bit misunderstood in recent years. Surely he joined Manchester United to be a squad player, knowing that his body wouldn't stand up to the rigours of being a smaller team's main man, playing every week with little service. He has always needed good service, and would rather get good service in fewer games at a bigger club than rely on scraps for a smaller one. That shows awareness of what he has to offer, not necessarily cynicism or greed. And wasn't he paid a smaller retainer, and goals/games-related bonuses, making it a good deal for club and player. </p> <p>The League Cup final, when he started, scored a goal and looked razor sharp before going off injured was all-too typical, sadly. Of course, he doesn't come out of the Newcastle episode well, although his time there was blighted by injuries and there were flashes of brilliance on the few occasions he was injury free. I think he learned from this, hence holding out for a supporting role in a blockbuster, rather than a lead in a soap. </p> <p>As a fan, I've always loved watching him play. His movement off the ball is just stunning when he is fit and confident. When he's not, he has a tendency to hide, like many goalscorers. But, as I said, I wish him well. And I hope a club like Everton offer him a chance to finish his career with a bit more of a bang.</p> </blockquote> <h2>5.

He could have gone to a bigger club in the last seven years but he decided to stay at Lille to develop first. He stayed at Lille untill he had outgrown the French league. There was only one \"incident\" in his career and that was with George Leekens and the Belgium squad. He was seen eating a hamburger in a restaurant with his family right after he was subbed off in a friendly game. You will never see Hazard complain or moan on the pitch. He has never gotten a red card and is not a cheater. He is a very confident and exceptionally talented player. I don't see anything wrong with his attitude.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17781474\">nonnynay</a></strong>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Hazard adapted fast to the Barclays Premier League. In that France, they don't even tackle. When a defender comes near the player on the ball, he initiates a game of rock, paper, scissors to win it off him. The winner then kicks the ball (or le triangle as they call it in that France) gently towards the other teams goal until they give up.</p> </blockquote> <h2>6.

The complete opposite of the dreary Match of the Day. </p> <p>Another pleasant surprise was being able to watch a lot of sport without any commentary at all and better still get to watch the cameras scan the arena during half time and watch the fans without them gurning at themselves on the big screen. There were some fascinating vignettes of people interacting. Those long moments of reflection are one of my many top memories from the summer games.

It's always difficult to get a sense of how you will do when you come up. You have the winning mentality from last season (in our case two successive seasons) and although I was wondering whether it was a step too soon, I had a sneaky feeling we would put on a good show yesterday and not be humiliated, even though a chunk of our squad was with us in League 1. Having been 30 minutess away from going out of business, no Saints fan can truthfully say that we would be better off consolidating in the Championship before pushing on \u2013 we nearly didn't have a club to support, so I'm never going to complain about what division we're in! </p> <p>I was hugely impressed with us yesterday and very proud of my club. Even if we do turn out to be this year's Blackpool, I for one would be happy to be relegated playing attacking, entertaining football if the alternative is being mid-table non-entities always the last to be shown on Match of the Day because our 1-0 defeats and 0-0 draws can no longer be shown on Teletext.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>A day after Sony's 14 August press conference at Gamescom, the company received confirmation that it had made a splash in Cologne from the unlikeliest of sources.</p> <p>What it showed had gone down so well that the Japanese giant's mortal enemy, the hacker group Anonymous, tried to put a damper on the mounting goodwill by claiming to have hacked another 10m PlayStation Network accounts.</p> <p>Once Sony's hugely beefed-up online security department had confirmed that those claims were false, Anonymous's churlish attempts at thunder-stealing merely added to the prevailing conviction that Sony was the most impressive player at Gamescom.</p> <p>Among the platform-holders, admittedly, it had the show to itself: both Microsoft and Nintendo were absent, but Sony still had to step up to the plate.</p> <p>And the weapons with which it managed that were impressive: it unveiled a typically whimsical and inventive PS Vita game called Tearaway, created by Media Molecule; a deliciously bonkers, mass-appeal PS3 platform game called Puppeteer from its Japan Studio; and a significant tie-up with the BBC which will bring the likes of Walking With Dinosaurs to the Wonderbook platform it unveiled earlier this year.</p> <p>Plus it demonstrated, using custom-designed levels for LittleBigPlanet, how the PS Vita can operating exactly like the Wii U's tablet controller, and provided further insight into highly anticipated PS3 exclusives such as The Last Of Us and Beyond: Two Souls.</p> <h2>Tearaway gives the Vita a boost</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394992567\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345546536773/Tearaway-008.jpg\" alt=\"Tearaway\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tearaway</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After copping some criticism at E3 for concentrating on the PS3 at the expense of the PS Vita, Sony conspicuously realigned its priorities by opening its Gamescom press conference with a round-up of Vita games.</p> <p>Titles such as Call of Duty Black Ops: Declassified, Assassin's Creed III: Liberation and Fifa 13, all due this Christmas, could turn out to be the console-shifting killer games it has so far lacked.</p> <p>But the game that stood out the most was <strong>Tearaway</strong> \u2013 a PS Vita exclusive created by the world's cuddliest developer, Guildford's Media Molecule. Indeed, it will be the first game the company has made that isn't a LittleBigPlanet variant.</p> <p>It looks every bit as charming as LBP. Media Molecule's co-founder Alex Evans and lead designer Rex Crowle explained that in Tearaway, you control a character called Iota, who is made from paper and whose head consists of an envelope which contains a personal message for the player.</p> <p>You must guide Iota on an action-platform adventure through a world made entirely of paper, until he is able to escape and enter the real world. Tearaway makes heavy use of the PS Vita's abundance of input mechanisms, including the joysticks, tilt sensors, touch-screen and especially, the rear touch-pad.</p> <p>Gameplay included tapping the rear touchpad to cause drum-skins to resonate and send Iota flying to otherwise unreachable areas, and using it to apparently thrust your fingers through the surface of the paper world, creating obstacles for Iota's pursuers. As you would expect from Media Molecule, there will be no mistaking it for any other game when it comes out in 2013.</p> <h2>Puppeteer adds weirdness</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394992568\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345546968579/Puppeteer-007.jpg\" alt=\"Puppeteer\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Puppeteer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sony premiered another game, this time for the PS3, which looks set to rival Tearaway in the individuality stakes. Called <strong>Puppeteer</strong>, it is being developed at Sony's Japan Studio, under the auspices of Englishman Gavin Moore.</p> <p>Moore explained that Puppeteer arose from a desire to reawaken his young son's imagination \u2013 he felt that modern games, with their near photo-realistic graphics, may look stunning, but don't spark flights of imaginative fancy among the young.</p> <p>Which shouldn't be a problem with Puppeteer, which is best described as utterly bonkers. It's also pretty experimental in certain respects.</p> <p>For example, all the action plays out from a single perspective: what you would see in a theatre, looking at the stage, with all the scenery moving around a fixed space. And then there's its plot: you play a boy-puppet called Kutaro, whose head is pulled off and eaten by the evil Moon Bear King.</p> <p>Banished to the magical theatre, he must first find a new head (and continue to do so \u2013 different heads provide different powers), then steal the Moon Bear King's magical scissors and use them to escape. Moore cited influences including Japanese Bunraku puppet theatre and Monty Python, and promised a meaty, full-game experience and gameplay that varies wildly.</p> <p>Puppeteer looks like one of those rare games that operates on two levels of humour, so could appeal equally to kids and adults.</p> <h2>The BBC signs up to Wonderbook</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394992569\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345547367223/Diggs-Nightcrawler-007.jpg\" alt=\"Diggs Nightcrawler\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diggs Nightcrawler for the Wonderbook</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At E3, Sony Computer Entertainment chief executive Andrew House unveiled Wonderbook, a bizarre assemblage using a book-shaped accessory, the PlayStation Eye camera and the Move controller to blur the boundaries between books and games.</p> <p>Reception among games journalists was split between admiration due to Sony's ability to sign up JK Rowling to the project, via Miranda Goshawk's Book Of Spells, and scepticism that it would provide much by way of gameplay. But House explained that it would be a platform, supporting all manner of content designed to engage kids in a manner which their parents would find conducive.</p> <p>That assertion gained some flesh at Gamescom, when Sony announced that it had signed up the BBC to provide content for Wonderbook, and gave a mock-up demo showing how Walking With Dinosaurs would work with it, promising to bring many more similar efforts from the BBC's archives (although it studiously avoided any specific mention of Doctor Who, which has consistently disappointed whenever anyone has tried to turn it into a game).</p> <p>And it showed another Wonderbook game called <strong>Diggs Nightcrawler</strong>, under development at Moonbot Studios \u2013 a humorous detective story with mock-hardboiled dialogue. While gaming purists may fail to see Wonderbook's appeal, it should appeal to parents keen to park their kids in front of something absorbing that won't cause their brains to atrophy.</p> <h2>LBP Cross-Control: emulating the Wii U</h2> <p>Sony's director pf product development, Pete Smith, gave an intriguing demo of what he termed Cross-Control between the PS3 and PS Vita \u2013 which essentially means using the PS Vita as a controller for the PS3.</p> <p>This is something that we have long known the Vita was capable of, but have never previously seen in action. And, of course, it's significant, because it lets the PS3 provide gameplay experiences that are more or less identical to what you will find on the Wii U.</p> <p>Smith played through a custom-designed LittleBigPlanet level containing things such as hidden traps which could be avoided only by paying attention to hints on the PS Vita's screen, areas that could only be negotiated using the rear touchpad and the ability for Sackboy to drop from the PS3's screen onto the Vita, then reappear on the machine on which the demo was actually running.</p> <p>You can expect more Wii U-alike games playable via Cross-Control, although it clearly isn't something Sony will build into games just for the sake of it.</p> <h2>And the rest</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394992570\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345547444800/Unfinished-Swan-007.jpg\" alt=\"Unfinished Swan\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unfinished Swan</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There were plenty of other snippets at Sony's press conference, which should help keep their existing consumers satisfied.</p> <p>We were shown some typically off-beat and visually inventive PlayStation Network games \u2013 notably Rain, in which you play a character who is only visible when he is being rained on; and <strong>Unfinished Swan</strong>, which starts off with a completely white screen and, as you splash black paint around, you begin to uncover a terrain that can be navigated.</p> <p>Sony teased with a tiny glimpse of Killzone Mercenary, a Killzone game designed specifically for the PS Vita. It added that PlayStation All-Stars \u2013 Sony's answer to Super Smash Bros \u2013 will support Cross-Play between the PS3 and PS Vita, and will introduce something called Cross-Buy, meaning that if you buy the PS3 version, you'll be able to download the PS Vita version for free. It also confirmed that the PS Vita would get PlayStation All-Stars and CoD Black Ops: Declassified bundles.</p> <p>All in all, there was an abundance of inventiveness, quality and commitment on display for those who own PlayStation 3s and PS Vitas.</p> <p>Sony's subtext seemed to be two-fold. Firstly, it isn't going to suddenly give up on the PS3 just because the PS4 is looming (in marked contrast to Microsoft). It has a good track record in that regard: both the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 outsold their successors for surprisingly long periods.</p> <p>And the almost bewildering amount of creativity on display spoke of its determination not to fall back on making new versions of the same old games. Which is refreshing in an industry which is increasingly risk-averse and happy to fall back on the tried and tested.</p> <p>he more risks that Sony takes, the quicker it will extricate itself from the doldrums into which it fell after last year's string of natural disasters.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Steve Boxer was taken to Gamescom by Sony</strong></p>",
  "<p>With the likes of Hayley Morley, Laura Catterall and Gwyneth Harrison making a success of plus-size modelling, women have started to see a more realistic body shape (occasionally) creep onto catwalks. But for most, an honest reflection of women's bodies is still missing from the media. Step forward Slink, a relatively new fashion and culture magazine whose cover line reads: \"Styling your curves, fashioning your life.\" But, as editor-in-chief Rivkie Baum explains, it's not easy getting the fashion world on board when you don't deal with sample sizes.</p> <p><strong>What made you start a magazine aimed at the plus size market? </strong><br>I graduated from the London College of Fashion and started freelancing as a fashion stylist, but I had only ever worked on straight size editorials. I ended up working in retail in a plus-size boutique and I suddenly realised that there was a market made up of women who had spending power but didn't have any media formats that reached them. The regular glossies didn't interest them and there was nothing luxurious or inspirational to show them what was 'in'. I'd seen European plus-size magazines but didn't like the editorials, and thought I could do a better job if I styled and shot them in the same way as straight size fashion shoots. </p> <p><strong>Is there any particular reason you chose Slink?</strong><br>We literally debated the name for hours and came up with nothing. I wanted a name that didn't automatically scream plus-size and therefore would never be embarrassing to be caught reading on the train or sneakily at work. The name literally just popped into my head. I like that it feels like a curvaceous word; it's fresh and fun.</p> <p><strong>How would you describe your own figure and did this influence the initial quest for a magazine that targets the plus size market?</strong><br>I'm a size 16/18, although my personal shape wasn't the catalyst to start the magazine. I've been into fashion my whole life and I've been every size from a 12 to a 22. I still read all the glossies and love working in straight size too, I just thought I could start a magazine that shows women no matter what their size. </p> <p><strong>What has the response been like?</strong><br>The response has been great! One email we had from a reader made me cry - a woman explained how her and a friend, both a size 14, were at their wit's end with how they're being made to feel about their bodies and how Slink has been refreshing in countering such views from the media. As soon as curvy girls know we exist, they love it, it's just making sure people know about us which proves the challenge. Gok Wan has just shot an editorial for his website and we've also hooked up with the American television show called <a href=\"http://www.biggirlrunway.com/2011/07/28/a-new-reality-show-called-curvy-girls/\">Curvy Girls </a>which will feature Slink in September.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394991940\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/20/1345478568026/A-lingerie-shoot-for-Slin-001.jpg\" alt=\"A lingerie shoot for Slink\" width=\"250\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lingerie shoot for Slink Photograph: Slink</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Slink</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Your magazine is entirely ad funded at the moment, how difficult has that been?</strong><br>It's been a real mixed bag. A lot of plus-size retailers have come on board which is great, but I'm deeply frustrated by the short-sighted views from mainstream brands in terms of advertising. This includes beauty brands. You're never too curvy for makeup, hair products or accessories. I think from a simple economic point of view the accessories and beauty brands are missing out on a significant market. At the magazine we illustrate catwalk trends on slightly fuller figures and samples aren't available out of season. We can't work three to six months ahead like most magazines and even plus-size brands for shopping pages aren't shot until the last minute which makes the fashion pages hard. Some brands have been reluctant to loan out items including high street brands that go up to a size 22. It's frustrating as a stylist and it limits me in what I can produce and also what I can show the readers. I find it odd that companies spend money producing products they're essentially too ashamed to push. </p> <p><strong>Have any straight size brands been supportive?</strong><br>Companies such as Dune and Dorothy Perkins have been great. We do work with some beauty brands but there's a big difference between talking to PR representatives and those who work on a marketing budget. Plus size isn't a priority even though the market is growing.</p> <p><strong>Who would be your ideal cover girl?</strong><br>If I'm being honest I'm not that bothered by celebrity covers. I love interviewing really interesting women that have achieved great things that inspire me, but if I had to choose it would be Christina Hendricks, Queen Latifa or Amber Riley.</p> <p><strong>Are there more plus size models than there used to be, and how is the process of booking models for the magazine?</strong><br>There are definitely more plus-size models than there used to be. The plus-size agencies have been incredibly supportive of Slink and I'm really grateful for that. I've worked with some of the most beautiful girls and it seems crazy that they're shunned because they're a size 16. It makes me laugh when brands fob people off by saying they couldn't use plus size girls as the models don't exist - they do, I've worked with them!</p> <p><strong>Do you think the perceptions of plus size models have changed in recent years?</strong> <br>I think there are definitely more retail options for plus-size women than there was, with brands like <a href=\"http://www.asos.com/Women/Curve-Size/Cat/pgecategory.aspx?cid=9577\">ASOS launching Curve</a> which is great. The problem with plus-size modelling in the UK is that it starts from a size 12, which is not really plus-size, so people use size 12 as a get out clause for 'shooting plus-size.' If you look at other countries such as Italian Vogue and French Elle, they put bigger models on the cover without any fuss, whereas in the UK it's such a huge deal. I think this is for two reasons. Firstly, there is still a lot of stigma attached to plus size women, who are still very demonised by the media, and secondly, it is harder to style plus-size so maybe most magazines just can't do it (now there's a challenge for them!). Models like Robyn Lawley and Tara Lynn do help but the UK is so backwards about plus size as we deal in size not actual health. We're too quick to judge and have a culture of crash diets and weight obsession.</p> <p>Rivkie was talking to Grace Quinn. <a href=\"http://www.slinkmagazine.com/\">Click here for more information on Slink magazine</a>.</p>",

His friend and fellow professional footballer Clayton McDonald was cleared of a rape charge.</p> <p>The trial at Caernarfon crown court earlier this year heard that Evans admitted he had sex with the 19-year-old woman following a night out at a seaside town in north Wales but said it was consensual.</p> <p>Evans's lawyers said a single judge at the court of appeal had refused his application for leave to appeal.

The judge added: \"You have thrown away the successful career in which you were involved.\"</p> <p>During his evidence, Evans, originally from St Asaph in north Wales, told the jury he had 13 caps for Wales and had scored 35 goals for Sheffield United. At the time of the attack he had been seeing his girlfriend for around 18 months and was still with her.</p> <p>Evans denied forcing the woman into having sex and insisted she was conscious. Asked what condition she was in, he said: \"She had had a drink but she was not very drunk.\" He said she was \"in control\".</p> <p>But in a police interview the woman said she had no memories of how she got to the hotel. She had drunk wine, four double vodkas and a shot of sambuca.</p> <p>CCTV footage showed her falling over in a kebab shop. A receptionist at the hotel described the woman as \"extremely drunk\" and said she was \"stumbling\" and \"slurring\".</p> <p>At the time of his conviction, Evans indicated that he intended to appeal.</p> <p>Port Vale defender McDonald, 23, who also admitted having sex with the victim, was found not guilty of the same charge.</p>",
  "<p>Web-based businesses can in theory be set up overnight with a very limited budget. However, the following legal issues are worth bearing in mind to minimise risk and optimise the value of investment.</p> <p><strong>Prepare for success</strong></p> <p>Consider how your business should be structured to provide the flexibility to bring in investment and grow. In most cases this will mean setting up a limited company in which you, your business partners and investors can hold shares.</p> <p>Compared with operating as a sole trader, a limited company has the key advantage of limiting your personal liability. Your company can then borrow \u2013 although most lenders and some suppliers will ask for personal guarantees \u2013 and enter into contracts in its own right. UK corporation tax rates are currently low. Ordinarily, the advantages of incorporating will outweigh the administrative burdens of running a company, which include annual accounts and other filings.</p> <p>As it grows, a company provides you with a platform to issue shares to investors in return for important growth capital. As is particularly common in the IT industry, share schemes can also be put in place to incentivise and help retain talent in your business.</p> <p>When structuring your company, put in place a legally drafted shareholders' agreement; it is important to protect your investment.</p> <p>As well as companies limited by shares, there are other types of legal entity, such as limited liability partnerships, but in our experience private limited companies by shares are the most popular for web-based businesses. Professional advice should be sought as to which structure is most appropriate.</p> <p><strong>Domain names and trade marks</strong></p> <p>When naming your site, you should avoid using a name which is the same, or similar to the trade mark or name of another business. Carrying out some basic searches will help you rule out potentially problematic domain names, and more sophisticated clearance searches can be carried out by trade mark agents.</p> <p>You may wish to register your business name as a trade mark, which means you can prevent others from using the mark or a similar mark for the same kind of goods or services. Doing this at an early stage is a good idea as your business name will not otherwise be protected until you have established a reputation in the market. It will also provide you with a valuable asset which can be attractive to investors.</p> <p><strong>Website and software development</strong></p> <p>If you use independent website developers you should review the terms of their contract carefully. Important details to consider include ensuring that the deadlines which the parties will work towards are set out in writing. Also, that the developers are required to provide some support to you once the site goes live; and that the obligation to pay for the services does not arise until you have had the opportunity to test and accept the site.</p> <p>Bear in mind that the developer will own copyright in any code created unless you have a written agreement to the contrary. So, if a consultant or freelance developer creates the code, you may wish to have ownership of copyright in the code assigned to you. This will need to be via a written agreement signed by the developer. If code is produced by the collaboration of more than one person, it is likely to be jointly owned and will need to be assigned in writing by each of the developers in order for ownership to pass to you.</p> <p>If you are creating your own software, make sure you check that any code which appears to be open-source \u2013 so free to download \u2013 has no awkward conditions attached to its use.</p> <p><strong>Third party material</strong></p> <p>If you plan to use third party copyright material on your site, such as music, video or text, you risk being liable for copyright infringement unless permission has been obtained for its use, or other limited circumstances exist.</p> <p>User-generated content can enhance your site, but entails certain risks. The content may be infringing because it contains third party copyright material, defamatory or illegal and as website operator you may be liable for it in certain circumstances. It is therefore important to include a prohibition in your site's terms and conditions against the use or uploading of illegal, infringing or defamatory content and reserve the right to remove this content at your discretion. You should also put in place an effective notice and take-down procedure whereby people who object to content can request that it is removed.</p> <p><strong>Information about users</strong></p> <p>New regulations provide that any website which uses cookies must provide users with clear and comprehensive information about their use on the site and the purpose, and in most circumstances obtain consent from each user to use them.</p> <p>Many web-based businesses will process users' personal data in some way. Personal data is essentially any information from which an individual can be identified. Virtually any use of this data amounts to processing, including storing it or disclosing it, so if you intend to do this you must comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 and are obliged to notify the Information Commissioners Office.</p> <p><strong>Learn from others</strong></p> <p>Talk to a trusted mentor from an early stage so they can guide you through the startup process. Having the benefit of the experience of someone who has gone through the process themselves can be invaluable to a new business.</p> <p><em>Nick Atkins is an associate in the corporate department at law firm <a href=\"http://www.stevens-bolton.com\">Stevens &amp; Bolton LLP</a>.

  "<p>The UK's millionth uninsured vehicle has been seized by police in the West Midlands today, but AA Insurance warned that fines for uninsured driving are still \"too lenient\".</p> <p>The seizure comes on the same day the <a href=\"http://www.mib.org.uk/Home/en/default.htm\" title=\"MIB homepage\">Motor Insurers' Bureau</a> (MIB) revealed that Bordesley in Birmingham has the highest concentration of uninsured drivers, with eight times the number of motorists driving vehicles without cover compared to the national average.</p> <p>Of the UK's 34 million drivers, an estimated 1.2 million are uninsured. Data shows 60% of the worst 20 postcodes in the country are in the West Midlands, followed by West Yorkshire with 25%. West Midlands police seized 5,881 uninsured vehicles between January and July 2012 alone \u2013 equivalent to 27 a day.</p> <p>Simon Douglas of AA Insurance said: \"A million cars seized is great news, yet there are still an estimated 1.2m vehicles on Britain's roads being driven without cover \u2013 that's around 1 out of every 25.</p> <p>\"We are still a long way from cleaning up Britain's roads. In uninsured driver hotspots such as parts of Birmingham, innocent motorists are eight times more likely than average to be hit by an uninsured vehicle.\"</p> <p>Since 2005, when police were given powers to stop vehicles identified as being driven without insurance, an average of 500 have been seized nationwide each day. Of those, an estimated 30% are crushed.</p> <p>Douglas said the penalties levied on uninsured drivers by the courts are too lenient, adding: \"It is not a victimless crime.\"</p> <p>He said uninsured drivers kill 160 and injure 23,000 innocent people a year, while the cost of the work carried out by the MIB adds about \u00a333 to every car insurance policy \u2013 the MIB provides compensation to innocent victims involved in collisions with uninsured drivers and those who fail to stop.</p> <p>AA Insurance wants the government to impose harsher penalties on uninsured drivers that reflect the premium they would pay were they honest drivers, as well as custodial sentences for repeat offenders.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mib.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/1D369F14-3CD4-425E-BA31-F7FA6C8F5A0F/0/Millionth_Vehicle_Seized_as_UKs_Uninsured_Hotspots_Revealed_ISSUE.pdf\" title=\"MIB: Millionth uninsured vehicle seized as UKs hotspots revealed\">Research conducted by the MIB (PDF)</a> among communities in the West Midlands and West Yorkshire in July 2012 found that a third of people do not understand the current laws on car insurance.</p> <p>Ashton West, chief executive at the MIB, said: \"Although we have made significant progress in recent years, with the level of uninsured driving having reduced by 30%, we still need to tackle some persistent offenders. That is why we are working with police and community leaders to engage people in these areas and improve their understanding and awareness of the law as well as the consequences.\"</p> <p>Ministry of Justice figures show that 94,000 drivers were convicted of driving without insurance in 2011.</p>",

He was 57.</p> <p>During his 21-year rule, Meles turned Ethiopia into one of Africa's fastest-growing economies and proved to be a key US ally in the war on terror. But he was also regarded as an authoritarian strongman whose critics suffered persecution, imprisonment and torture.</p> <p>Meles had not been seen in public for about two months. He failed to attend a meeting of African Union heads of state in the capital, Addis Ababa, last month, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/08/ethiopia-meles-zenawai-not-seen\" title=\"\">raising speculation about his health</a>.He died \"abroad\" at around 11.40pm on Monday after contracting an infection, state television said on Tuesday.</p> <p>His demise creates a potential power vacuum in Addis Ababa. Expressing concern, Kenya's prime minister, Raila Odinga, told the BBC World Service: \"We need a seamless, peaceful, transition of power. The region, the horn of Africa, needs stability.\"</p> <p>Hailemariam Desalegn, appointed deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister in 2010, will be sworn in as prime minister after an emergency meeting of parliament, said Bereket Simon, the communications minister.</p> <p>\"To be sick is human and he has been struggling to be healthy in the last year,\" Simon told reporters in Addis Ababa. Meles's family were by his side when he died, he said. \"He has been diligently delivering on his promises; illness has never been a hindrance.\"</p> <p>Simon added: \"I assure you everything is stable and everything will continue as charted by the prime minister.\"</p> <p>On Tuesday, state TV showed pictures of Meles against a soundtrack of classical music. Simon called the death shocking and devastating.</p> <p>Born on 8 May 1955, Meles grew up in the northern town of Adwa, where his father had 13 siblings from various women. He moved to the capital on a scholarship after completing an eight-year elementary education in just five years.</p> <p>A hardline Marxist-Leninist and a towering intellect, Meles became president in 1991 after helping to oust Mengistu Haile Mariam's Communist military junta, which was responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths. He became prime minister in 1995, head of the federal government and armed forces.</p> <p>Meles introduced a controversial form of ethnic nationalism and, from 1998-2000, went to war with neighbouring Eritrea, a conflict that resulted in tens of thousands of deaths. The countries remain sworn enemies. Eritrea will be watching developments closely.</p> <p>The US has long viewed Meles as a strong security partner and has given hundreds of millions of dollars in aid over the years. US military drones that patrol east Africa, especially over Somalia, are stationed in Ethiopia.</p> <p>Ethiopia has long been criticised by human rights groups for the government's hardline crackdowns on dissent. During the G8 summit in Chicago last May, Meles was interrupted soon after he started to speak: \"You are a dictator! You have committed crimes against humanity!\" a member of the audience shouted.</p> <p>The bald, bespectacled politician, visibly shocked at first, tried to continue talking before staring down, stony-faced.</p> <p>Leslie Lefkow, deputy director of Human Rights Watch in Africa, said Meles brought Ethiopia out of a hugely difficult period following Mengistu's rule and made important economic progress, but the ruling party has been too focused on building its own authority in recent years instead of building government institutions.</p> <p>\"On the human rights side his legacy will be much more questionable,\" Lefkow told the Associated Press. \"The country remains under a very tightly controlled one-party rule and this will be the challenge for the new leadership, to take advantage of the opportunity that his death presents in terms of bringing Ethiopia into a more human rights-friendly, reform-minded style of leadership.\"</p> <p>Meles's government has been criticised for its use of arbitrary detention, torture and surveillance of opposition members inside Ethiopia. The ONLF, an opposition group that consists mostly of ethnic Somalis, has openly clashed with the government, including in 2007 when Ethiopia sent troops to Somalia to fight al-Shabaab militants.</p> <p>During Meles's election win in 2005, when it appeared the opposition was likely to make gains, Meles tightened security across the country, and on the night of the election he declared a state of emergency, outlawing any public gathering as his ruling party claimed a majority win. Opposition members accused Meles of rigging the election, and demonstrations broke out. Security forces moved in, killing hundreds of people and jailing thousands. Almost the entire leadership of an opposition group that won an unprecedented number of seats in parliament was jailed for life for treason.</p> <p>In 2009, an anti-terror law was enacted, under which more than 100 opposition figures have since been arrested. The government insists it is tackling rebel groups that have links with al-Qaida and Eritrea.</p> <p>More than 10 journalists have also been charged under the law, according to the <a href=\"http://cpj.org/\" title=\"\">Committee to Protect Journalists</a>. The group says Ethiopia is close to replacing Eritrea as the African country with the highest number of journalists behind bars. Two Swedish journalists were jailed for 11 years on charges of entering the country illegally and aiding a rebel group.</p> <p>Navi Pillay, the UN high commissioner of human rights, has criticised the verdicts, saying journalists, human rights defenders and critics were facing a \"climate of intimidation\".</p> <p>Meles responded with trademark defiance, labelling the duo as \"messenger boys of terror groups\".</p> <p>In 2010, Meles won a further five years in office while receiving a reported 99% of the vote in an election that the US and other international observers said did not meet international standards.</p> <p>Meles was the leader of a political coalition known as the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front. He was also the longtime chairman of the Tigray People's Liberation Front and has always identified strongly with his party.</p> <p>When asked what he thought would be his legacy, Meles once said: \"I cannot separate my achievements from what can be considered as the achievements of the ruling party. Whatever achievement there might have been, it does not exist independent of that party.\"</p> <p>Under Meles, Ethiopia recorded improvements in education with the construction of new schools and universities. Women gained more rights. And in the mid-2000s Ethiopia experienced strong economic growth, tripling in size in 15 years, which won Meles plaudits. The International Monetary Fund in 2008 said Ethiopia's economy had grown faster than any non-oil exporting country in sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <p>The prime minister forged close business ties with India and Turkey as well as China, which footed the $200m bill for the sprawling, new headquarters of the African Union in Addis Ababa.</p> <p>Despite those gains, Ethiopia remains heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for 85% of employment. Per capita income is only about $1,000 \u2013 about $3 a day.</p> <p>Meles is survived by his wife, Azeb Mesfin, an MP, with whom he had three children. State TV said funeral arrangements would be announced soon.</p>",

Asked on Monday night whether he thought there was any chance the British authorities would carry out its threat, the BBC reported that the president said: \"While the United Kingdom hasn't retracted or apologised, the danger still exists.\"</p> <p>Assange has been in the embassy in Knightsbridge since mid-June, and, despite Quito's offer, cannot leave for the airport as Britain is refusing to give him safe passage. The interview with Correa opened with a brief report from inside the embassy, showing the 41-year-old Assange embracing his lawyer Baltasar Garz\u00f3n, minutes before he addressed supporters from the balcony outside on Sunday.</p> <p>Speaking in advance of a meeting of the Organisation of American States on Friday, Correa said he hoped the gathering would provide him with strong backing from regional allies.</p> <p>\"Remember that David beat Goliath. And with many Davids it's easier to bring down a number of Goliaths,\" he said. \"So we're hoping for clear and coherent backing because this violates all inter-American law, all international law, the Vienna convention and all diplomatic traditions of the last, at least, 300 years on a global scale.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's been predicted that up to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/29/budget-job-losses-unemployment-austerity\">500,000 public sector jobs could be cut by the end of 2015</a>. This has led to an unprecedented number of public sector workers trying to make the difficult move into the private sector. This transition can be extremely challenging due to the different working environments between commercially-driven organisations and public sector institutions.</p> <p>Candidates need to completely change their mindset in terms of embracing a new workplace culture when making a successful move to the private sector. The private sector is primarily focused on being profit driven and is free from many of the bureaucratic restrictions in the public sector. In a private sector, however, employees' main objectives are focused around financial performance and productivity. </p> <p>Projects in the private sector tend to be faster moving so it's important to show prospective employers that you have the ability to work efficiently in a fast-paced environment. Public sector workers who may not used to this way of working could find this much more pressurised and stressful.</p> <p>However, if those wanting to transfer into the private sector plan their move strategically, it can result in a new and rewarding career with added benefits. Here are some tips to help you make the move.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>A focused and targeted approach is key</strong>. Before rewriting your CV it's important to understand what type of organisations you want to apply to, where you want to be located, what level you want to be working at and what your ideal position is.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Avoid using public sector terminology</strong>. To illustrate that you are capable of making a successful move into the private sector it's important to use the right language, which is measurably different between the private and public sector. Read job descriptions and person specifications carefully, comparing like-for-like jobs in the public sector so you can understand the different language used.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Maximise your time when speaking to recruiters</strong>. Ask them if they have a good understanding of public and private sector workers and enquire what experience they have of assisting candidates transitioning.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Social media must be part of your career development campaign</strong>. Embrace social media and ensure you are a proactive jobseeker. A <a href=\"http://recruiting.jobvite.com/resources/social-recruiting-survey.php\">recent Jobvite social networking study</a> reports that 93% of companies plan to use social recruiting; it's critical to familiarise yourself with these types of online resources.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Tailor your CV</strong>. Use genuine statistics or numbers to give examples of cost savings, productivity improvements, process improvements, reduction in waste or losses or improved customer services. This will all help to secure an interview in the private sector. It's important to break your CV down into skills, achievements and experience.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Customers are not necessarily the same as service users</strong>. In the private sector a company's customers are where their revenue (and your salary) comes from, regardless of if they are individuals or other companies. It's important to illustrate the level of your commercial awareness in this area.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Don't wait for the right advertisement</strong>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15952516\">60% of jobs secured are never advertised</a>. Making a targeted speculative approach to organisations that you want to work for, can really pay off if you are tactical. Why do you want to work for that organisation? What value can you bring to the table? Why would you make a great fit with their existing team? These are just some of the key questions you need to ask when identifying companies you want to approach.</p> <p>While the differences between public and private sector workers may seem wide, in fact they have never been so close as a result of the public sector pursuing best value. For instance, HR strategies more typically associated with the private sector \u2013 such as those promoting efficiency or encouraging staff loyalty \u2013 have been widely adopted. Measures have also been introduced in the public sector that link individual performance with strategic objectives. The privatisation of many public services has also encouraged a more enterprising culture, which has required staff to exhibit much greater professional flexibility and adaptability.</p> <p>It's important for private sector companies and the public sector workers making the move into commercial organisations to note that these changes will result in an influx of talent to the private sector in areas such as:</p> <p>\u2022 Management of multi-million pound budgets and critical decision-making<br>\u2022 Identification and implementation of cost control and best-value initiatives<br>\u2022 Compliance with complex regulatory or legislative requirements<br>\u2022 Management and mitigation of risk<br>\u2022 Development of people and teams<br>\u2022 Management of complex, highly political stakeholder relationships<br>\u2022 Knowledge of how governmental organisations work and an in-depth understanding of their key requirements.</p> <p>Finally, forget the competition. While it may be a candidate-heavy market now, the reality is that if there are two or twenty applicants, you are still competing. Stop worrying about what the rest will write or say and focus on you and the value you can offer.</p> <p><em>Elizabeth Bacchus is a writer, a regular public speaker on the subject of career development, a career coach who has worked with individuals from a broad range of industry sectors and the founder of <a href=\"http://thesuccessfulcv.com/\">The Successful CV Company</a></em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>You walk in on that first day with some idea of the class, the classroom and the layout of the school. You're overdressed; for me, it was a grey suit with a red tie in a lame attempt to accentuate authority. Your one aim will be to show you're in complete control but deep down you are second guessing your every move and decision.</p> <p>I remember a teacher making a complimentary comment on my table arrangement and all I was thinking was: \"Is she taking the mick?\" You then hear a range a comments which either deeply patronise or scare you half to death. One teacher said I needed to be prepared for the worst year of my life. Just think, you are doing what you want to do, what you studied hard for during your PGCE or GTP and your reward: get ready for \"the worst year of your life\". Some teachers just love to share how horrible and emotionally draining their NQT year was, they expect you to feel the same as some sort of rites of passage but it really doesn't have to be that way.</p> <p>I've completed my NQT year and have managed to enjoy some success. But you need to find your own way through; you can read all the books about the NQT year but in reality your own methods and strategies will help you overcome some of the pitfalls books and your teacher training college may not have warned you about. Here are some of mine:</p> <p><strong>Observations: </strong>Everybody hates them, including me, but what is it that we actually hate about them? Some people say it is someone judging you, other say trying to read the faces of the observers throughout the lesson, but for most of us it's the grades. My advice? Let go of chasing grades and focus on the actual teaching.</p> <p>Once <a href=\"http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/\">Ofsted</a> came along and gave me a 'good' for a lesson that had all the hallmarks of an 'outstanding' (according to its criteria) I suddenly realised just how subjective grades can be. For one person it's a 'good' for another it's a 'satisfactory'. Observers can generally justify giving a grade based on the criteria as it can be quite open to interpretation. To avoid being caught up in petty squabbles over what one child understood or didn't, try to gather as much quality teaching ideas as possible. Then implement them to the best of my ability and watch the observations grades take care of themselves. Some observations will be great and others may fall short of your expectations. The key is not to get overjoyed or depressed, keep improving and move on.</p> <p><strong>Other teachers:</strong> The one thing that has baffled me throughout my NQT has been the personalities I've come across. Having previously worked in the corporate environment, I thought the teaching industry would offer a refreshing change. I expected supportive and motherly treatment from all those around me (naive, I know). That was true to some extent, but every now and then you encounter competitive, political and sometimes ruthless teachers. Let's face it there is a hierarchy in teaching and some teachers just want to climb (I call them game players). NQTs can be useful pawns in school politics, so it's important to keep your wits about you.</p> <p>Take information from these teachers with a pinch of salt and try to be as independent as possible. If a game player offers some basic support that you don't really need, think twice before accepting. The next you'll hear could be how hard you're finding the year and how dependant you are on others.</p> <p><strong>Parents:</strong> The one thing that most scared me before I started my NQT year was having to deal with parents. What if a parent is annoyed with me for telling off their child? What if they find a mistake in the homework I've set? The truth is sometimes they love you and sometimes they don't. That usually has nothing to do with your personality or teaching style.</p> <p>What I've found to be useful is to treat parents like customers. Always make them feel welcome, be prepared to talk about their child if something comes up and, most importantly, smile. If you are happy then they can see that their child will be happy.</p> <p>Don't worry, I'm not ignoring the fact that some parents can cause scenes and will not be happy. In that instance, I've found it best to diffuse. Calm parents down by telling them you understand, take them away from the children so your authority is not undermined and speak in a low, calm voice.</p> <p>I also always ask parents to speak with me after school where I can control the environment. Also finish with the lines \"thank you for telling me\" or \"any time you need me come and talk with me.\" Parents, like the rest of us, need to feel they are not being ignored. A happy parent can be a valuable aid in the progress of that child. Get them onside and collaboratively you can achieve great things for the child, which is all that counts.</p> <p>Your NQT year can seem daunting but actually, it's important to know what to expect. I'm sure by the end of your NQT year you will be able to create your own set of tips. What's important is that you not only how to survive but to thrive.</p> <p><em>Nikesh Pandya is now a class teacher at a primary school in the London borough of Brent.<br></em></p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>In March 2012 Shelter <a href=\"http://england.shelter.org.uk/news/march_2012/londoners_driven_out_by_housing\" title=\"\">published a report</a> on the state of renting in the capital. Its H<a href=\"http://england.shelter.org.uk/campaigns/homes_for_london\" title=\"\">omes for London campaign</a> painted a much more negative picture of city life than that portrayed by the Olympic and Paralympic-driven celebration of all things London.</p> <p>Once the Games are over the cracks in the lives of real Londoners will come to the surface. Central to the concerns of many is the problem created by out of control rent levels for those majority who can no longer afford a mortgage deposit on even the tiniest studio apartment.</p> <p>At the time of publising Shelter's report, chief executive Campbell Robb said: \"These findings paint a worrying picture of thousands of families across the capital being stretched to the limit by the high cost of renting, praying they won't be hit by another rent rise that could tip them over the edge.\"</p> <p>The report talks about a growing number of renters being close to crisis point: London are rents currently double the rate of inflation. The report also makes the case that in order to afford a standard London rent a tenant would have to be earning \u00a33,500 per month. As a relatively well paid housing professional, I earn just over half of that.</p> <p>I'm also in a dual position of being both a London tenant and a housing worker who deals with the problems of London tenancies on a day to day basis. I see the very real fallout of uncontrolled rents that Campbell Robb points to. Any seasoned housing observer knows that rents have never been higher while mortgage rates have never been lower.</p> <p>Private landlords describe the rental market as being \"bouyant\"; personally I would use a different word: crippling. It's a matter of perspective and self-interest.</p> <p>I recently held a presentation for a group of homelessness workers and was reminded of the case law of Regina v Hillingdon LB <em>ex parte</em> Tinn, a case that revolves around a homeless application based on a property being considered unreasonable to continue to occupy because it was unaffordable.</p> <p>Mr and Mrs Tinn bought their council property under the right-to-buy. Mr Tinn left the marriage, leaving Mrs Tinn to shoulder the bills on her own. She made an application to the council to buy her property back. The local authority refused, saying the only way she would be considered homeless would be if she walked away from the property or sold it. (Presumably, had she done so, the council would have deemed her intentionally homeless \u2013 but that is another matter).</p> <p>The case went to court and Judge Kennedy held the following: \"It cannot be reasonable for a person to continue to occupy accommodation when they can no longer pay the rent and make mortgage payments without so straining their resources as to deprive themselves of the ordinary necessities of life, such as food, clothing heat, transport.\"</p> <p>It's an interesting summation. Back in 1988 issues over the affordability were a rare event, but in the London of 2012 it is the norm as more and more tenants have to make the same difficult decisions that Mrs Tinn faced a quarter of a century ago. How many people in the capital have to choose between paying their rent and feeding themselves, or deprive themselves of basic necessities in order to keep a roof over their heads?</p> <p>How about the case of Regina v Wandsworth LBC <em>ex parte</em> Hawthorne 1994. Ms Hawthorne made a homeless application, having been made homeless because of rent arrears. Her argument was that her husband had left her with minimal income and she had to choose between feeding her child and paying the rent. The council said that, because she had deliberately chosen not to pay her rent, she had made herself homeless intentionally. The court decided against the council, stating that her decision not to pay did not address the reasons for the decision having to be made. In Ms Hawthorne's case her income simply did not go anywhere near meeting her rent, and through no fault of her own.</p> <p>If we use the precedent in this case as a defining principle for the affordability, does this render a huge proportion of London's population officially and legally homeless \u2013 solely on the basis that the current rent levels are forcing them into Mrs Tinn's and Ms Hawthorne's unenviable position?</p> <p>Unfortunately, the answer is no. Although pretty damning in themselves, case law of this type is not considered by councils making decisions on homelessness cases. Instead, councils have take account of prevailing circumstances within the district, so if everyone is being crippled by their rent levels then it is simply a case of joining the club.</p> <p><em>Ben Reeve-Lewis is a tenancy relations officer for a local authority in London</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for news, views and </strong><a href=\"http://housingjobs.theguardian.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>the latest jobs</strong></a><strong> direct to you</strong></p>",

O'Shea, who presents Channel 4's Dangerous Reptiles series, had a scare at the weekend after a rather too-close encounter with one of his sharp-toothed friends. He was feeding a king cobra at West Midlands Safari Park on Sunday when it clamped its jaws around his leg. Knowing that the reptile's venom is strong enough to kill an elephant, staff leapt to his rescue and O'Shea was flown to the nearest hospital. Not to worry, though \u2013 O'Shea said yesterday: \"It was just a nick, really. I won't lie, it did hurt a bit. We are going to have a full investigation, but it was an accident\".

Galloway was due to partner me in looking through Monday morning's newspaper headlines. It is usual to pair up a leftwing feminist such as myself with a man with different political views in order to provoke a healthy and sometimes entertaining debate. I assume that the producers cleverly chose Galloway to join me because of his outspoken support of Julian Assange, and his view that what Assange is accused of is not even \"<a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/08/george-galloway-assange-only-accused-bad-sexual-etiquette\" title=\"\">real rape</a>\". I have written about this false division <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2006/nov/16/daterapestory\" title=\"\">on a number of occasions</a> so am well versed in the arguments used by reactionary folk who seek to minimise the effects of sexual assault, and have us believe rapists are all monsters and strangers.</p> <p>I was delighted to be able to go head-to-head with Galloway on this topic because my blood pressure has taken a hammering while listening to him describing Assange's acts as \"minor misdemeanors in the UK legal system\". Two English courts listened to that argument from Assange's lawyers and rejected that assertion, but it has not stopped Galloway from taking rape denial to a new level when he said \"even if the allegations made by these two women were 100% true \u2026 they don't constitute rape\".</p> <p>Unfortunately Galloway did not show up at Sky News (due to being stuck in traffic I understand), so I was alone discussing Assange. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bindelj/status/237297255391051777\" title=\"\">As I later tweeted</a>, I was gutted. This is what I would have said to him in the green room and, where appropriate, on air:</p> <p>This is not a debate about whether or not the allegations against Assange constitute rape or not. It is about a much wider issue, that of rape denial and the blaming of women in general. When rape in marriage was made a crime back in 1992, it was because of attitudes like his. It used to be enshrined in law that once a woman had consented to sex once \u2013 such as with her husband \u2013 he could stick it in whenever he felt like it. Today, it is not a legal right to have sex with a person simply because you have been there before.</p> <p>But some liberal-lefty men have been bending over backwards to rewrite definitions of rape to suit their blanket adoration of Assange. They seem to be too stupid to work out that you can admire and defend <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/wikileaks\" title=\"\">WikiLeaks</a> without canonising its founder. In the world of Assange-lovers, women who allege rape and sexual assault are either lying vixens or silly unsuspecting pawns in the fight between freedom fighters and the US.</p> <p>Galloway and those who spout rubbish about what \"real rape\" really is (ie nothing other than that committed by a stranger wielding a knife who attacks a virgin) are not rape apologists, but rape deniers. Most rape falls into the category that Galloway has decided is simply \"bad sexual etiquette\", ergo most women are lying, and most men are the victims of spurious accusations from women who should read up on rape legislation.</p> <p>He has also remarked on Press TV that, \"I mean not everybody needs to be asked prior to each insertion. Some people believe that when you go to bed with somebody, take off your clothes, and have sex with them and then fall asleep, you're already in the sex game with them.\" He continued: \"I don't believe either of those women, I don't believe either of these stories.\"</p> <p>If a woman groped the penis of a sleeping man it would be sexual assault. If a woman is asleep and she is penetrated by a penis, she is not in a position to consent, and therefore, under English law, it is rape. We all know this, but the problem is that many of us chose to pretend otherwise when supporting a man lauded as a god-like figure. What is depressing is that it is, in this instance, coming from men on the left \u2013 those who are supposed to be our comrades and allies. Yet again I am hearing loud and clear: \"Yes dear, you can have your equality, but can you wait until we have ours first please?\"</p> <p>No chance boys. You cannot have your so-called pro-equality politics and be a rape denier.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bindelj\">@bindelj</a></p>",
  "<p>There's a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/NVCITN\" title=\"\">first class article</a> in Nature this week on the reasons Americans reject the science of climate change. It has wider implications for a lot of the ways in which we think and talk about rationality.</p> <p>The author, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/NVCRGQ\" title=\"\">Dan Kahan</a>, is not a scientist but a professor of both law and psychology. He is attacking the position that people reject the science of climate change because they are too stupid and too irrational. The idea that people disagree with them only because they are stupid and irrational is probably the consensus among scientists, even if you can't call it the scientific consensus because there's too much evidence to show that it is wrong.</p> <p>Kahan cites <a href=\"http://bit.ly/NVDhgq\" title=\"\">some of his own research</a> to show that the members of the lay public who are most science literate, and the most proficient at technical reasoning, are also the most divided on climate change \u2013 in other words, the deniers of climate change are among the most scientifically literate members of the general population.</p> <p>This is not so much because they reckon they are smarter than the experts, but because they are able to pick the experts who agree with them: \"People with different values \u2026 individualists compared to egalitarians, for example \u2026 draw different inferences from the same evidence. Present them with a PhD scientist who is a member of the US National Academy of Sciences, for example, and they will disagree on whether he really is an 'expert', depending on whether his view matches the dominant view of their cultural group.\"</p> <p>One explanation is that we have a problem of propaganda: the lobbyist's rule that for every PhD there is an equal and opposite PhD makes it easy for malevolent forces to blind the world with bullshit.</p> <p>Kahan, however, sees a rather more powerful explanation. \"Positions on climate change have come to signify the kind of person one is. People whose beliefs are at odds with those of the people with whom they share their basic cultural commitments risk being labelled as weird and obnoxious in the eyes of those on whom they depend for social and financial support.\"</p> <p>The result of these pressures are everywhere. It is not just your conclusions that your peer group influences but also your data. Both believers in and deniers of climate change find their positions vary with the most recent weather \u2013 but <a href=\"http://bit.ly/Rv3Akn\" title=\"\">they disagree, sincerely</a>, on what this weather has actually been.</p> <p>Personal experience is not infinitely malleable. Perhaps if there were anything we could do about the weather, our opinions of it would be modified by the effects we saw our actions having. But there isn't. The weather is uncontrollable and this is even more true of climate change. What you or I do as individuals makes no difference to global warming. Even what the whole of the UK does won't change much.</p> <p>The kind of changes in consumption needed to make a real difference to our carbon output would require multinational action at government level. But democratic governments act from perceived self-interest even more than individual voters do.</p> <p>Since their actions are consistently directed to an end, an economist could call them rational. Both voters and governments, in ignoring the very painful adjustments that would be needed to diminish climate change, are definitely working to a utility function. They want to minimise their own unpopularity and will see the world in ways that make their actions seem rational. In general the right has understood this better than the left (or do I say this because the misdeeds of the other side are so much more apparent?).</p> <p>Underlying all this confusion is the problem that we don't have a way of ranking rationalities, so that the word means something more to a moral agent than it does to an economist. There may be ways of fixing that and averting catastrophic global warming that don't make use of religious resources, but I can't think of any.</p> <p>It's important to this argument to understand that religious resources need not be theistic. All they need do is make manifest a higher rationality than self-interest. This isn't an argument about whether God exists, but about how human beings make up their minds and form their characters. Atheist states based around myth and ritual are not hard to find. Social Democratic Sweden struck me even at the time as a theocracy organised around the worship of itself, and the official ideology was atheist. That's a benevolent example but there are plenty of malevolent atheist regimes that could serve as unpleasant examples. One of the most chilling aspects to accounts of life in North Korea is the degree to which official propaganda appeals to altruism and bravery.</p> <p>What religious thought \u2013 and ritual \u2013 can supply is the two things absent from normative consumer liberalism. The first is a belief that the choice between ends is not arbitrary or wholly personal: that there are moral facts of the matter; that saving as much of humanity as possible is an obligation on all of us, and that this is actually true, and not just a matter of preference.</p> <p>The second is the kind of conformism, reinforced by all kinds of social ritual, large and small, which will enforce the social discipline needed to carry societies through some pretty ghastly changes. Let's face it, any adjustment to an ecologically sustainable standard of living is going to be a lot nastier than anything Greece is going through now. It will need considerable determination and solidarity.</p> <p>All of the elements necessary for this are in fact present in a rather disorganised way in the society we have now got. The basic mechanism of social conformism is not so much policing behaviour \u2013 that needs only outrage \u2013 but policing <em>emotion</em>: the kind of second-order enforcement of conformity where my failure to feel outrage becomes itself a matter for your outrage. There's plenty of that around today.</p> <p>Similarly, I don't think our society believes there are no moral facts. On the contrary it believes that it is a moral fact that choice is the highest moral value, and so that it is wrong to maintain that other moral truths exist. Perhaps this can function as a unifying and compulsory truth if enough people believe it. It's certainly no less mythical than the alternatives.</p> <p>Kahan ends his piece with a flight into pure fantasy: \"Overcoming this dilemma requires collective strategies to protect the quality of the science-communication environment from the pollution of divisive cultural meanings.\" But the whole thrust of the piece is that there is no science communication that takes place independent of culture. You're going to have to fix the culture, so that words like \"trust\" and \"sacrifice\" mean something, before the science can in fact be communicated.</p>",
  "<p>Instant feedback via social networking sites such as Twitter is encouraging a culture of self-censorship that threatens to stifle literary endeavour, the multi-award-winning author Patrick Ness has said.</p> <p>\"Instead of bringing us all together in an omnipresent, multi-faceted discussion, the internet instead has made sectarianism an almost default position. The nature of mass debate has become solely binary,\" he said.</p> <p>Addressing the <a href=\"http://www.edinburghworldwritersconference.org\" title=\"\">Edinburgh world writers' conference</a>, Ness <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/20/patrick-ness-censorship-in-the-internet-age\" title=\"\">spoke</a> of the fear of having words \"misappropriated, misquoted or badly paraphrased\" on Twitter.</p> <p>He said he doubted whether Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses would have been written today.</p> <p>\"Ask yourself, truthfully, would you sit down tomorrow morning and start writing a novel with Muhammad as your central character? A Muhammad treated as a fallible man rather than a prophet? A Muhammad perhaps even criticised?\"</p> <p>Ness added: \"Though no one really wants to say so out loud, most of us seem to accept these days that the comments on Guardian articles \u2026 while occasionally containing interesting replies, are far more often the domain of outraged point-missers, incandescently furious pedants, and trolls who don't bother reading past the sub-headline.\"</p> <p>The novelist China Mi\u00e9ville said self-censorship was both inevitable and desirable. \"There are millions of things we shouldn't say. We self-censor all the time, and a bloody good thing too. Our minds are washing machines full of crap that we pick up over our years on this earth.</p> <p>\"One of the problems [in this debate] is the elision between having the legal right to say something (and I don't trust the state to tell me when I can and can't say something) and having the moral right not to be told off for saying something objectionable.</p> <p>\"This is why the free speech warrior who thinks they have the right to say what they like and then complain when someone complains \u2013 that's not censorship. Censorship is when the police come round.\"</p> <p>The Chinese poet Xi Chuan said censorship in his homeland was the \"daily air\" a writer breathed, but it defied simple categorisation wherever it occurred. \"Censorship is unavoidable wherever you have social taboos, political taboos, religious taboos,\" he said.</p> <p>In China, which lacks a censorship law but where books are routinely suppressed through a complex system of second-guessing the wishes of the authorities, censorship could be used as a tool by writers, he said.</p> <p>\"Usually if a book is criticised it will cause a sensation. But [the authorities] are getting cleverer. If they are not satisfied by a book they are starting to keep silent, and so you will die on your own. In China, censorship is like a big game: you can use it to become famous or influential.\"</p> <p>The writers at the conference, led by the Dominican-American author Junot D\u00edaz, pledged to write a letter of protest over the suppression of works by <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/31/arizona-ethnic-studies-ban-controversy_n_1243975.html\" title=\"\">Latino authors and on Latino subjects in schools in Arizona</a>.</p>",
  "<p>A shaken and grief-stricken Hollywood has saluted Tony Scott as a great director as speculation swirls over why he leapt from a bridge to his death in Los Angeles bay.</p> <p>An autopsy was due to be carried out on Monday afternoon a day after police divers recovered the British film-maker's body from water beneath the Vincent Thomas suspension bridge spanning the harbour. There was no immediate official word about the results of the autopsy.</p> <p>Officials and relatives were studying suicide notes reportedly left in his office and the black Toyota Prius he parked on the bridge at around 12.30pm local time before jumping \u2013 \"without hesitation\", according to witnesses \u2013 to his death 185ft below.</p> <p>He hit the water close to tourists taking a boat cruise. \"He landed right next to our tour boat, and many of us saw the whole thing,\" one witness told TMZ.</p> <p>An anonymously sourced report by ABC that said Scott had inoperable brain<br>cancer caused uproar on Twitter. </p> <p>Hours later <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2012/08/20/tony-scott-suicide-no-brain-cancer-tumor/\">TMZ rubbished the claim</a> and said Scott's wife had told investigators her husband did not have cancer or any other serious medical issue. </p> <p>\"The family asks for privacy during this time,\" said Simon Halls, a publicist who represents Scott and his brother Ridley, also a veteran director and producer. He was due to fly from London to Los Angeles on Monday.</p> <p>News of the apparent suicide stunned Hollywood on Sunday night. A grim-looking Tom Cruise, who launched to stardom with Top Gun and remained close to Scott, was photographed leaving a restaurant and texting on his phone.</p> <p>Cruise paid tribute on Monday to the the 68-year-old director of Top Gun, Crimson Tide, Beverly Hills II and other blockbusters: \"Tony was my dear friend and I will really miss him,\" the actor said in a statement. \"He was a creative visionary whose mark on film is immeasurable. My deepest sorrow and thoughts are with his family at this time.\"'</p> <p>Twitter flowed with praise for his talent and condolences to his family. \"Tony Scott \u2026 You left us too soon,\" tweeted Rosario Dawson, who starred in Scott's most recently released film, 2010's Unstoppable. \"How terribly sad. What a lovely, kind human being you were. I will love and miss you much. Blessings to your family. Rest In Peace.\"</p> <p>\"No more Tony Scott movies. Tragic day,\" tweeted the director Ron Howard. </p> <p>\"RIP Tony Scott. So sad to hear this,\" said documentary film-maker Morgan Spurlock. </p> <p>Several touched on the fact Scott's commercial success with big budget action movies had not been matched by critical acclaim, with detractors saying style trumped substance.</p> <p>\"True Romance (written by Tarantino) did not receive the recognition<br>it so rightly deserved (one of the decade's best films),\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mmflint\">tweeted</a> film-maker Michael Moore. </p> <p>Jonathan Levine, another director, highlighted Scott's first feature, a 1983 vampire horror starring David Bowie, Susan Sarandon and Catherine Deneuve which bombed with audiences and most critics. \"For those who haven't, please watch Scott's first film, \"The Hunger.\" it is immensely ballsy and beautiful... RIP.\"</p> <p>Channel 4 films said it would run a retrospective of his work. Others recalled the director's warmth. \"Tony always sent personal, handwritten notes &amp; always drew a cartoon caricature of himself, smoking a cigar, with his hat colored in red,\" tweeted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carnojoe\">Joe Carnahan</a>.</p> <p>Richard Kelly, who wrote the screenplay for the thriller Domino, which Scott directed, said: \"Working with Tony Scott was like a glorious road trip to Vegas on desert back roads, a wild man behind the wheel, grinning. I felt safe.\"</p> <p>Despite the lack of Oscars, Scott remained busy. He was a producer on Ridley's recent blockbuster Prometheus. Scott Free Productions, which the brothers ran together, has a film starring Christian Bale due next year.</p> <p>It was also working on Killing Lincoln, a film based on a bestseller by Bill O'Reilly, and was mulling a sequel to Top Gun, the biggest hit of 1986. Cruise, who reportedly was going to play an instructor to new pilot hotshots, scouted locations last week at a naval air base near Fallon, Nevada.</p> <p>Scott was also had recent and upcoming television mini-series such as Coma, The Good Wife, Numbers, and Pillars of the Earth. If he was stung by the lack of critical acclaim, or the greater success of Ridley, he never showed it. \"The biggest edge I live on is directing. That's the most scary, dangerous thing you can do in your life,\" he said in a 1995 interview, sentiments he often repeated.</p> <p>Rarely seen without his trademark red baseball cap, he had collaborated with Denzel Washington, Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt, Will Smith, Robert De Niro and Gene Hackman, among others. Hits included The Taking of Pelham 123, Man on Fire, The Last Boy Scout and Enemy of the State.</p> <p>Witnesses saw Scott climb a fence on the south side of the bridge's apex on Sunday and swiftly leap into the void. The Los Angeles police department, California highway patrol, firefighters and the coast guard conducted a search, while cargo vessels slowed so as to minimise disturbance. Sonar equipment helped divers locate and recover the body around 4.30pm.</p> <p>Scott was married to Donna Scott, who had starred alongside Cruise in Scott's 1990 film Days of Thunder. The couple had twin boys, Frank and Max. The director, whose full name was Anthony David Scott, lived in Beverly Hills.</p> <p>He grew up on Teesside, northern England, where his father was harbour-master. Tony originally wanted to be a painter but followed Ridley, six years his senior, into making television commercials, then feature films.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 August 2012. The original misspelled Teesside as Teeside. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>The pursuit of paid bloggers by Judge William Alsup, who presided over the Oracle-Google trial earlier this year, has gone into its second lap. Google, says Alsup, \"failed to comply\" with his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/aug/20/oracle-google-oracle-patent-trial\">order demanding the two sides to reveal whether they pay anyone who has commented publicly on the trial</a>, with a disclosure date of last Friday. Only Oracle offered any names, that of Florian M\u00fcller, who it pays a retainer, and who writes the FOSS Patents blog.</p> <p>Now Alsup has told Google that \"the order was designed to bring to light authors whose statements about the issues in the case might have been influenced by the receipt of money from Google or Oracle\" and that its statements on Friday - in which it said that it pays nobody directly, but said that many bloggers might receive money indirectly, as well as staff, and some people at institutions indirectly - \"failed to comply\" with his original order.</p> <p>On Friday Oracle formally noted the relationship with M\u00fcller, who first disclosed the payments in April on his blog as the trial got underway. He has also previously disclosed that he is paid by Microsoft over patent consultancy.</p> <p>\"Even though the payment was for consulting work, the payment might have influenced the blogger's reports on issues in the civil action,\" writes Alsup in his latest order. \"Just as a treatise on the law may influence the courts, public commentary that purports to be independent may have an influence on the courts and/or their staff if only in subtle ways. If a treatise author or blogger is paid by a litigant, should not that relationship be known?\"</p> <p>That echoes accusations made by Oracle in its submission, in which it said that Google \"maintains a network of direct and indirect 'influencers'; to advance Google's intellectual property agenda. This network is extensive, including attorneys, lobbyists, trade associations, academics, and bloggers, and its focus extends beyond pure intellectual property issues to competition/antitrust issues.\" It alleged that \"Google brought this extensive network of influencers to help shape public perceptions concerning the position it was advocating throughout this trial.\" </p> <p>Alsup apparently agrees that may be more to Google's influence than direct payments. Google now has until noon PST on 24 August to disclose payments. Alsup told it: \"Payments do not include advertising revenue received by commenters. Nor does it include experts disclosed under Rule 26 [to the court]. Google suggests that it has paid so many commenters that it will be impossible to list them all. Please simply do your best but the impossible is not required. Oracle managed to do it. Google can do it too by listing all commenters known by Google to have received payments as consultants, contractors, vendors, or employees. As for organizations receiving money, they need not be listed unless one of its employees was a commenter. Gifts to universities can be ignored. Again, Google need only disclose those commenters that can be identified after a reasonably diligent search.\"</p> <p>That will probably broaden the number of \"paid\" commenters on Google's side, as it funds a number of organisations. Oracle suggested a couple of organisations which receive money from Google and which were not listed on its 17 August disclosure.</p> <p>But there's a kicker for Oracle too in the order: \"Oracle must supplement its list if this order clarifies any issue for Oracle.\"</p> <p>Even so, what is still unclear is the extent to which Alsup thinks members of the jury - who came down in Google's favour on almost every point in the trial - were influenced by any paid bloggers. As the payments to M\u00fcller clearly had no effect, it remains an open question whether Alsup thought Google somehow benefited from any network of funded bloggers and commentators.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.scribd.com/embeds/103366228/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-c3vkk48cljposl970q1\"> <a title=\"View Google v Oracle Disclosure Order on Scribd\" href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/103366228/Google-v-Oracle-Disclosure-Order\" style=\"margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block; text-decoration: underline;\">Google v Oracle Disclosure Order</a><iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/103366228/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-c3vkk48cljposl970q1\" data-auto-height=\"true\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.772727272727273\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_33546\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> </figure>",
  "<p>Law and education are close to the Scottish government's heart; not least as the two institutions in Scottish life to remain distinct despite 300 years of union with England and Wales. </p> <p>Certainly, the Scottish National party government in Edinburgh is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-12711509\">proud of its stance</a> on free university tuition, stressing the link between access to education and social mobility as a mark of its progressive credentials. And Alex Salmond, the first minister, cannot be accused <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/jun/16/scotland-laywers-alex-salmond-judiciary\">of lacking passion</a> in defending the Scottish legal system.</p> <p>But where law and education coincide, practical reality does not reflect political principles. Less well-off students are being excluded from legal training, and social mobility is in retreat. </p> <p>Poorer students could become lawyers more easily in Margaret Thatcher's Scotland than they can in Alex Salmond's. Douglas Mill, a prominent lawyer and former chief executive of the Law Society of Scotland, now teaching at Glasgow university, is among those who are worried. He told <a href=\"http://www.journalonline.co.uk/Preview/1010909.aspx\">the society's journal</a> earlier this year:</p> <blockquote> <p>We're in danger of reverting to being an upper middle class profession.</p> <p>I think it would surprise most solicitors over 40 how much debt people are carrying into the profession these days. Each of the last two years we've had 179 acceptances of offers for the Diploma and only 167 have started the course. </p> <p>There may be other reasons, but I think our leakage is largely explicable by people who thought they might get a grant and when they didn't, pulled out.</p> </blockquote> <p>Recent graduate <a href=\"http://cfalp.wordpress.com/student-profiles/lauren-reid/\">Lauren Reid</a> can testify to this. Inspired to pursue a career in law by school work experience, she became the first in her family to attend university. But she cannot take her ambitions further without completing a one-year postgraduate course, the DPLP (diploma in professional legal practice). </p> <p>However, over the past 20 years the grants available to assist students like Lauren have not kept pace with rising costs. Assistance with fees now only covers half the actual fees charged whilst a means-tested maintenance grant dwindled into insignificance and was scrapped. And, as Scottish ministers class the DPLP as a second course of study, students are not eligible for normal student loans. </p> <p>Lauren calculates the capped fees contribution of \u00a33,400 leaves her needing to find more than \u00a39,000 to meet the balance of fees and her living costs for the year. For those like her, for whom this is impossible, <a href=\"http://www.scottishlegal.com/index.asp?cat=NEWS&amp;Type=People%20and%20Places&amp;newsID=41786#41786\">the government's assurances</a> that access to the DPLP is 'based on ability to learn, not ability to pay' is mere wishful thinking.</p> <p>An effective solution is available and already operates for other professions, including veterinary medicine and architecture, which require more than a four-year degree. </p> <p>For these professions - despite bizarrely denying it - the Scottish government <a href=\" http://cfalp.wordpress.com/2012/06/18/comparisons/\">helps secure fair access</a> by allowing students to benefit from student loans for a fifth year of study. Similar arrangements support students on the postgraduate teaching diploma. Yet, with law, potential DPLP students are being denied that same loan arrangement.</p> <p>The government's refusal to take this simple step for DPLP students shows a complete lack of political will to engage with the issue of fair access to the legal profession. But this issue is galvanising the students themselves: earlier this month, <a href=\"http://cfalp.wordpress.com/\">our campaign</a> for fair access to the legal profession succeeded in getting students from all ten Scottish university law courses to join its steering group. </p> <p>Calls for action have been brushed off by repeating the assertion that fair access already exists. At best this indicates complacency. The responsible minister, Cabinet secretary for education, Mike Russell, declined the Law Society of Scotland's invitation to discuss the issue personally, delegating any contact to his officials, who merely maintain that the government intends to do nothing.</p> <p>Worse, recent reforms of postgraduate funding demonstrate a complete failure to understand the realities of the situation. The government claims the move gives <a href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2011/11/24100419#\">improved support and wider access</a>. In practice, the reforms are ineffective and wasteful. </p> <p>Loans remain untargeted by financial need and too small to be meaningful but are now available regardless of academic merit. The only additional beneficiaries will be well-off students who didn't perform well enough academically to gain assistance under the previous scheme. </p> <p>The government's approach also illustrates a profound lack of understanding of the importance of a representative legal profession. As <a href=\"http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2012/06/17/there-is-a-democratic-deficit-in-the-courts-heres-how-to-fill-it/\">leading legal blogger</a> Adam Wagner, describes, a nation's legal system inevitably reflects the people who make it up. </p> <p>Scotland's legal system should fairly balance the needs and interests of all sections of society; that task will be almost impossible if the legal profession itself is overwhelmingly drawn from those from the most privileged backgrounds. </p> <p>And if, in 25 years time, we <a href=\" http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/lawyers-say-talent-stifled-by-old-boy-networks-1.926807\">are still lamenting</a> the fact that our senior judges are mostly privately educated, it will because the Scottish government is doing nothing today to ensure that increasing diversity amongst law graduates is reflected in a broader legal profession.</p>"
