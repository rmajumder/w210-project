  "<p>To be caught cheating at Harvard is bad enough. The august university prides itself on incubating America's elite in the world of law, business and politics.</p> <p>But now it has been revealed that scores of Harvard students are suspected of cheating on a single class. And the course's title? An Introduction to Congress.</p> <p>Though that will likely fail to surprise the many cynical observers of American politics, it has certainly stunned college officials. Harvard has immediately launched an investigation. </p> <p>\"These allegations, if proven represent totally unacceptable behaviour that betrays the trust upon which intellectual inquiry at Harvard depends,\" said Harvard president Drew Faust in a statement.</p> <p>After the allegations first became public the college refused to reveal the exact nature of the course in question. But the student newspaper, the Harvard Crimson, broke the story of the politics link and immediately sent a ripple of shock, mixed with humour, around the blogosphere.</p> <p>\"That's funny on so many levels,\" tweeted Andreas Goeldi, who works for an online video marketing firm in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Harvard is located.</p> <p>The Crimson said the politics course in question was taught during the spring by Professor Matthew Platt. After similarities were noticed in up to 20 student exam papers by an examiner the matter was brought to the attention of the administrative board and an investigation was launched. </p> <p>That probe has now found some 125 of the course's final papers were suspicious and has begun contacting students involved.</p> <p>Possible punishments range from being suspended for a year to an official warning. The class was taken by only 250 students meaning a staggering half are now suspected of cheating. </p> <p>The newspaper quoted an email sent to students taking the exam that said it was \"completely open book, open note, open internet, etc..\" but warned them not to discuss it with each other and to treat it as an \"in-class\" exam.</p> <p>The Associated Press reported that Harvard had now launched a committee on academic integrity to be headed by Jay Harris, the university's dean of undergraduate education. The panel may even consider bringing in an \"honour code\" for academic honesty. </p> <p>\"We believe in due process for students and fairness. Everyone wants it done yesterday, but we have to be patient. It's going to take as long as it takes,\" Harris told the news agency.</p> <p>The rise of the internet, and the ubiquity of laptops among a student body, has led to many complaints that it is now too easy for students to take exam answers and course work from the world wide web. </p> <p>However, the Boston Globe said that it appeared the Harvard students in question had not taken material from outside sources but appeared to have copied parts of the answers from each other. If the scandal is proved true it will doubtless be the largest cheating ring to have hit an elite Ivy League college in recent memory.</p>",
  "<p>An inquiry into child sex abuse by Church of England clergy in Chichester has found many children suffered \"abiding hurt and damage\" because local safeguarding measures had fallen \"woefully short\" for two decades.</p> <p>The inquiry by the Archbishop of Canterbury's office concluded that the West Sussex diocese has \"an appalling history\" of child protection failures, with \"fresh and disturbing\" allegations continuing to emerge.</p> <p>Lambeth Palace will now oversee clergy appointments and the protection of children and vulnerable adults in the diocese amid concerns that safeguarding procedures remain \"dysfunctional\".</p> <p>The archbishop, Rowan Williams, who set up the investigation, said the interim report \"confirms that there have been many and longstanding failures in implementing a robust and credible safeguarding policy in the diocese of Chichester\".</p> <p>Bishop John Gladwin and Chancellor Rupert Bursell QC, who are leading the inquiry, wrote: \"It has been particularly distressing to us to have met people whose lives have been deeply wounded by the abuse they have suffered at the hands of clergy and of lay people holding positions of responsibility in the Church. Sadly, these wounds often refuse to heal.</p> <p>\"It is clear to us that many lives have been blighted. Some have sought justice through the courts of law. Clergy have gone to prison for their abuse of children. We are clear that those who have sought justice through the courts are but the tip of the iceberg.\"</p> <p>The report said the abuse was made worse by the \"very slow\" way the diocese recognised concerns and failed to act with \"rigour and expedition\".</p> <p>\"A whole series of investigations and reports across nearly two decades bears witness to a profoundly unhelpful and negative culture in parts of the diocese that led to its failure to take the action needed.</p> <p>\"Fresh allegations have been made and are being pursued by the relevant authorities and new people are coming forward to tell the sad story of their own abuse at the hands of clergy and other people in positions of authority in the church.\"</p> <p>Gladwin said the problems had not only been caused by \"priests who abuse\" but also the culture and practice of the diocese.</p> <p>The inquiry found that although it is national Church policy that every cleric should have a Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) check at least every five years, on 14 June there were 138 clergy in the diocese without up-to-date clearance.</p> <p>The report, believed to be the first of its kind in the Church of England for over a century, calls for \"a radical change of culture in the diocese \u2013 one in which the sanctity, dignity and well being of children and vulnerable adults is openly and transparently at its heart\".</p> <p>Three local priests have been charged this year with child sex offences.</p> <p>The report is believed to be the first of its kind in the Church of England for more than a century.</p> <p>In May last year, a review found serious failings in the senior clergy after two priests were allowed to continue working despite being accused of serious child abuse offences.</p> <p>Colin Pritchard was the vicar of St Barnabas in Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, until 2007, despite having been first reported to police over sex offences 10 years earlier. He was later jailed for sexually abusing two young boys.</p> <p>One of the boys was also abused by Roy Cotton, who worked as a parish priest in Brede near Rye, but prosecutors decided there was not enough evidence to charge him before he died in September 2006.</p> <p>Dr Williams apologised and paid tribute to the victims of the abuse.</p> <p>He said: \"The abiding hurt and damage done to them is something that none of us in the Church can ignore, and I am deeply sorry that they should have been let down by those they ought to have been able to trust.\"</p> <p>The reports recommendations will also be considered by the Church of England's national safeguarding group to assess the need for any changes to its policies or the law.</p>",
  "<p>For once Kevin Pietersen was a passive bystander as controversy erupted all around him on a seemingly quiet afternoon at sunny Taunton.</p> <p>The fuss was provoked by Murali Kartik's running out of the young Somerset batsman Alex Barrow as he backed up, followed by the Surrey captain Gareth Batty's refusal to withdraw the appeal when offered the option to do so by the umpire Peter Hartley. By the letter of the law Barrow was out, but via a method of dismissal long considered against the spirit of the game and rarely witnessed on the county scene.</p> <p>Pietersen's only involvement was to wander in and join the small group discussing the incident as 20-year-old Barrow made his way disconsolately back to the pavilion.</p> <p>As Barrow walked off, having made 12 in a Somerset total that then read 191 for six, boos rang out across the County Ground. Angry spectators continued to jeer Kartik, while Peter Trego responded by twice sweeping the Indian left-arm spinner over deep square-leg for six.</p> <p>There were angry scenes below the Surrey dressing room balcony at tea, with supporters of both sides directing abuse at Batty and Kartik, who joined Surrey when Somerset opted not to offer him a new contract at the end of last season.</p> <p>Surrey's team director, Chris Adams, later conceded that the dismissal \"challenged the spirit of cricket\" but backed Batty over a decision made \"in the heat of battle during a very difficult season\".</p> <p>Adams said: \"I went to see the umpires at tea and asked them for their account of what happened. It appears that Barrow was warned two or three deliveries before by Kartik about leaving his ground.</p> <p>\"When it happened again Kartik stopped before his delivery stride, which is important, then took the bails off and appealed. The umpire then went to Gareth and asked him if he wanted to uphold it.</p> <p>\"After a few moments consideration and a discussion with Kartik, Gareth said 'yes'. His reason for that was that within the laws of the game it was the right decision.</p> <p>\"I will back the skipper. Gareth is very forthright that he considered everything and made the decision he did for the right reasons. Whether he would make the same decision if the situation arose again he doesn't know.\"</p> <p>The incident took the gloss off a fine Trego knock after James Hildreth (85) and Chris Jones (50) had batted through a morning session delayed for 40 minutes by a wet outfield.</p> <p>Trego has struggled with the bat during a season that has seen him take 48 Championship wickets, but he relishes a fight and produced a string of belligerent blows.</p> <p>Surrey led by 23 when Somerset were bowled out for 294, and extended that advantage to 81 by reaching 58 without loss at the close.</p> <p>After the match Somerset captain Marcus Trescothick spoke about the Alex Barrow dismissal, saying: \"I'm very disappointed. It's not something you want to see in cricket. I have never witnessed anything like it before at any level. Theoretically, Alex was out, as we all know, but it was against the spirit of the game.\"</p> <p>A contrite sounding Batty said: \"I will talk things through with Marcus. I don't want this to bring the game into disrepute.\"</p>",
  "<p>Strengthened levees may have saved New Orleans from catastrophe as hurricane Isaac swept through Louisiana, but residents of outlying areas believe the city's upgraded defenses contributed to the flooding that wrecked their homes.</p> <p>Outside the protection of the costly new federal shield that rings the city, some flood barriers were overwhelmed and, in scenes reminiscent of Katrina, many people had to be rescued from rooftops as floodwaters submerged their streets.</p> <p>Some of those whose homes were damaged claimed that New Orleans's upgraded levees had done them more harm than good. </p> <p>\"We've never got caught like this, right there where I was at my house. In Katrina I never had no water \u2013 never got none in the house. This time, here, eight feet of water,\" said Jimmie Hutchinson, of Braithwaite, a town in Placquemines parish that was almost completely swamped when water spilled over a levee that was supposed to protect the community.</p> <p>Isaac plowed inland on Thursday, causing fresh flooding and power outages in Louisiana and Mississippi and prompting emergency evacuations and warnings, even as New Orleans began its post-hurricane clean-up. About 500 people had to be rescued by boat, and there were at least two deaths.</p> <p>Officials began releasing a water dam at a lake near the Louisiana-Mississippi border, hoping to ease the pressure. They were also working on a breach in Plaquemines Parish. As Isaac moved north, power lines were downed and trees knocked over.</p> <p>The region to the north of New Orleans was badly affected, with numerous roads impassable in Slidell and surrounding areas.</p> <p>Businesses bordering Lake Pontchartrain off Interstate 10 were under several feet of water, cars had been abandoned and mobile homes detached from their foundations. While winds were light, heavy rain continued Thursday afternoon, making driving difficult and hampering attempts to restore electricity.</p> <p>Residents of Braithwaite,on the east bank of the Mississippi less than 15 miles from central New Orleans, sought refuge in attics and were rescued from rooftops by boat after floods engulfed the area. They were taken to the lesser-affected town of Belle Chasse, a short distance away on the other side of the Mississippi.</p> <p>Louisiana senator Mary Landrieu said this week that there were political squabbles over funding and location of flood defenses after Katrina and expressed regret that the federal system was not more comprehensive. In some cases, outlying regions have had to organize and fund their own protective measures.</p> <p>\"Unfortunately \u2026 low-lying areas outside the federal system, in particular lower Jefferson and Plaquemines parishes [were hit],\" she told CNN. The coast's refineries are vital to the US oil industry. \"Hurricane Isaac has reinforced for us once again just how vulnerable these critical areas are. We must re-engage the Corps of Engineers on this,\" she said.</p> <p>After Katrina, the federal government allocated about $14.5bn to the US Army Corps of Engineers to improve hurricane defenses in New Orleans. The system is largely complete save for some planned drainage improvement work.</p> <p>St Bernard Parish was badly hit by Katrina but escaped serious damage this time thanks to significant upgrades including doubling the height of its levee and adding concrete walls to replace the old dirt structure. Its defenses were not breached.</p> <p>Braithwaite's levee, however, is not part of the federal system and is maintained by Plaquemines parish. That will change, after the Army Corps of Engineers signed an agreement earlier this month that will see $1.4bn spent on taking control of non-federal levees and improving them. Work was planned to start in September but the accord came too late for those left homeless this week.</p> <p>Residents whose homes were badly damaged told the Guardian that they believed the new levees in an adjacent parish had contributed to the unexpected flooding of their neighborhoods as the repelled water was pushed towards lower and weaker defenses.</p> <p>\"They've got floodgates over there that King Kong couldn't get out of, around St Bernard,\" Jinx Easley said. \"We've been fighting over 30 years for the levees.\"</p> <p>Jimmie Hutchinson said: \"Them levees ain't no good at all. Especially with the new levees around St Bernard, new waters and all that, it just funnels in on us. And our levee's not federalized.\" Like others in Plaquemines parish, he ignored a mandatory evacuation order. He rode out Katrina with few problems and as a result had not expected a far less powerful hurricane such as Isaac to cause any serious issues.</p> <p>Inside a YMCA in Belle Chasse that had become a shelter for last-minute evacuees, Zonia Guillot said her house had been similarly affected. It came as a shock because when her family moved the short distance from St Bernard to Plaquemines after Katrina they thought they were moving to a safer area.</p> <p>\"We went through the same thing with Katrina but we were in St Bernard Parish when that happened and we bought on this side thinking that it'd be better,\" she said.</p> <p>\"I think this was worse because Katrina, we only had four feet of water, we were able to save a lot of things. This time, it went over the house. The levee wasn't strong enough. They put a deep levee for St Bernard and that got us in a hole made of water.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Army Corps of Engineers said that its defenses had been designed to have a \"negligible\" impact on areas outside the perimeter. \"The system built post-Katrina was heavily studied and modeled for that reason, to make sure it wouldn't have any additional impacts to areas outside the system,\" she said.</p> <p>A lack of co-ordination among local communities and state and national authorities had been evident until recently, according to Professor Robert A Thomas, director of the Center for Environmental Communication at Loyola University. \"Until the beginning of the summer we didn't have what I would call a 'coastal-wide plan'\" for protecting at-risk areas, he said.</p> <p>Thomas added that disparate needs meant it was hard to strike a balance between economic, environmental and cultural forces when deciding how best to protect and exploit the Louisiana coastline. \"I'm not saying parishes have made mistakes,\" he said. \"[But] as long as we have parishes making individual decisions that are not linked to the overall plan you are at risk of having failures.\"</p>",
  "<p>MPs have urged RBS and Lloyds TSB to allow customers with basic bank accounts to use their cards in rivals' cash machines, saying that limiting withdrawals could lead to a decrease in the number of free ATMs.</p> <p>In a report published on Friday today, the Treasury committee criticises the banks for limiting access to cash machines. Basic account holders are limited on the grounds of cost as each time they use a rival ATM the bank incurs a charge.</p> <p>The report said the cost savings \u2013 about \u00a310 per account for RBS and \u00a312 for Lloyds \u2013 were small and \"have potentially disproportionate effects\". It adds: \"Their [RBS and Lloyds] actions also sit uncomfortably with their stated commitment to basic bank accounts.\"</p> <p>The committee suggested the ban, introduced by Lloyds TSB in 2006 and RBS in 2011, could cut access to free cash machines if copied by other basic bank account providers.</p> <p>\"The main purpose behind the development of the basic bank account initiative was to improve financial inclusion. It is particularly regrettable that this 'beggar my neighbour' approach may therefore lead to the closure or, in the case of cash machines not operated by banks, change to charging at existing free to use cash machines,\" the committee said.</p> <p>Basic bank accounts tend to be used by people who cannot meet banks' minimum criteria to open a personal current account. By limiting access to all cash machines, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/aug/17/rbs-customers-barred-rival-atms\" title=\"\">consumer groups argue that</a> customers who do not live or work near an RBS or Lloyds cash machine can incur extra travelling costs to withdraw their cash.</p> <p>The Treasury Committee launched an investigation after RBS wrote to customers with basic bank accounts in August 2011 to say they would no longer be able to use cash machines run by other banks or independent third parties.</p> <p>The chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, Andrew Tyrie, said: \"The Committee understands the need for banks to control costs, particularly in these difficult times. In this instance, the financial benefits to Lloyds and RBS appear relatively small but those affected would be amongst the most vulnerable people in society.</p> <p>\"In the longer run, both the way services are offered to customers and the charges they pay need reform to secure greater banking competition.\"</p> <p>In a letter to the Treasury Committee, Brian Hartzer, chief executive of UK retail banking at RBS, said: \"We currently pay a charge on every transaction, every time someone checks their balance or makes a withdrawal at an ATM run by another company. As a consequence, we are running our basic accounts at a loss to the bank which we need to reduce.</p> <p>\"If we continue to make losses we will not be able to innovate and invest in our business, ultimately to the detriment to all of our customers.\"</p> <p>An RBS spokesman added: \"RBS will look closely at the committee's report. We remain committed to offering a free basic account for people who may otherwise struggle to access banking services. Our basic account customers have free access to one of the largest cash machine networks in the country, including RBS, NatWest and Tesco ATMs, and can withdraw cash from more than 11,000 post offices across the UK.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Lloyds TSB said: \"Our basic bank account customers also have access to all Halifax and Bank of Scotland, one of the largest network of ATMs in the country, as well as post offices across the UK. They also have access to our Money Manager internet banking service.\"</p> <p>Barclays, HSBC and Santander all said they will continue to provide basic bank holders with unrestricted access to cash machines.</p>",
  "<p>Alan, an art teacher in his late 40s, began squatting a few months ago when his marriage broke down. He enquired about social housing, but was told none was available. \"I was born in London and have lived here all my life but it seems I'm expected to go somewhere else where I know nobody,\" he says. \"Is that what the big society is all about?\"</p> <p>His timing could not have been worse. From Saturday Alan and up to 20,000 other squatters in England and Wales face eviction as police prepare to enforce a radical change to the law which criminalises those occupying residential buildings. Ministers are calling it the \"end of squatters' rights\" and the first guaranteed protection for home owners.</p> <p>Squatters' rights organisations say the change in the law is unnecessary when legal remedies already exist for property owners, insisting that most squats are in previously unoccupied premises, while housing charities say that it could trigger a sharp increase in homelessness.</p> <p>The new offence, introduced under clause 144 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act, will be punishable by up to six months' jail and fines up to \u00a35,000 in England and Wales.</p> <p>The change in the law affects only residential, not commercial, premises. In a circular sent out to judges, courts and the police, the Ministry of Justice confirms that what are commonly known as \"squatters' rights\" \u2013 preventing forcible entry to an occupied building \u2013 will become redundant in relation to residential premises.</p> <p>The housing minister, Grant Shapps, said: \"No longer will there be so-called 'squatters rights'. Instead, from next week, we're tipping the scales of justice back in favour of the homeowner and making the law crystal clear: entering a property with the intention of squatting will be a criminal offence.\"</p> <p>To be found guilty of the offence prosecutors will have to prove that a squatter entered the building knowing he or she was a trespasser and intended to remain.</p> <p>Police are refusing to comment on any plans to embark on evictions over the weekend, but some eviction notices have already been reported in London.</p> <p>In the east London squat where Alan lives, residents spoke of their fear of eviction. Sixteen people live in the four-storey house which has otherwise been unoccupied for seven years. Water and electricity has been reconnected and is paid for by the squatters. The youngest is a 12-year-old boy who lives there with his father.</p> <p>A carpet, torn into strips, hangs over the kitchen entrance to reduce noise and keep heat in during winter. Some walls are decorated with murals and graffiti, others are bare and clean having been repainted. The property is awaiting demolition.</p> <p>Rachel, not her real name, is in her late 20s. She does voluntary work with the NHS. \"This house may be classified as residential,\" she said, \"but it's not fit to live in. We had to stop leaks in the roof and replumb the building.</p> <p>\"We want to improve the building so that we can have an agreement with the owners to stay. Unfortunately they won't talk to us. I have never claimed benefits before but I may have to consider it. Suddenly becoming a criminal overnight is tough. Housing is a basic need.\"</p> <p>Katie, a supply teacher, lives in a nearby squat. She said: \"I have been squatting for a year. I was in an abusive relationship. I didn't have enough money to rent. All the advice agencies said I was not eligible for help because I'm a single person. For me squatting has been a lifeline to escape domestic violence.\"</p> <p>Estimates of squatter numbers across the country vary, some suggesting as many as 20,000 people could be displaced.</p> <p>Phil Gormley, the chief constable of Norfolk who speaks for the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) on uniformed operations, said: \"[We] can now act immediately and remove squatters directly from properties in line with the new legislation and ensure people's homes are protected.\"</p> <p>Asked whether it planned to begin raids on squats in the capital this weekend, the Metropolitan police declined to comment on \"operational\" matters. A spokesman said: \"[We have] been working with the Ministry of Justice, local authorities and relevant charities regarding implementation of this offence and enforcement.</p> <p>\"Throughout this process the [Metropolitan police] has sought to protect the vulnerable, in terms of the harm caused to homeowners, but also to take full account of the systems that are in place to provide support for the homeless. The MPS will investigate all reports of crime, and where suspects are identified will consider the necessity for arrest.\"</p> <p>Squatters groups said police had pasted notices on the doors of squats in London warning that the law is about to change. Myk Zeitlin, a volunteer at the Advisory Service for Squatters, said: \"This legislation is badly designed. It is a response to a myth started by sections of the media that people were having their homes squatted while they were out. \"There were already laws to cover such non-existent circumstances.\"</p> <p>Duncan Shrubsole, director of policy for Crisis, the charity for single homeless people, said: \"The majority of people squatting are in empty buildings. Forty percent of homeless people have squatted at some time. We will see street homelessness rise if there's a blitz against squats. It will have a dramatic impact.\"</p> <p>Catherine Brogan of Squash, the campaign group which opposed the bill, said: \"It's the wrong time to be criminalising homeless people. Rents keep going up. Vulnerable people are being demonised. This will benefit landlords who leave their premises empty.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's easy to see what the choice of a new head of Barclays is supposed to signal. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/30/barclays-new-chief-executive-antony-jenkins\" title=\"\">Antony Jenkins is a refreshingly boring banker</a>; a surprisingly welcome breath of muggy air after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/02/barclays-libor-scandal-change-banking-culture\" title=\"\">all the turbulence</a> at the high-street institution long since captured by investment bankers.</p> <p>A retail-banking veteran, Mr Jenkins's background is in branches and Barclaycard, not mortgage derivatives and misreporting Libor. Where his predecessor, Master of the Universe Bob Diamond, last year took \u00a317m from the bank in pay, shares and perks \u2013 not to mention \u00a35.7m to cover his tax bill \u2013 Mr Jenkins will receive a comparatively modest \u00a38.6m (provided he meets demanding targets \u2013 and that your comparison is solely with other millionaire bankers). Even while the charge sheet for Barclays is still growing \u2013 see this week's revelation that it is now under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office \u2013 Mr Jenkins' arrival is intended to draw a line under all the recent trouble, by indicating that a new retail broom will sweep away the work-hard-pay-hard investment-banking culture.</p> <p>To which, all one can say is: nice try but no executive cigar. Barclays is probably Britain's most troubled financial institution. The past year alone has seen it hit by the PPI mis-selling scandal, the revelation of force-feeding small businesses unsuitable and hugely costly financial products, the censure of the Treasury over corporate tax-dodging, the Libor scandal, and now an SFO investigation. Many of these cases are still snowballing; the news that Barclays and others fixed money market rates has prompted full-scale investigations by a phalanx of official bodies (<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2167469/Libor-scandal-Now-FBI-investigates-14-Barclays-bank-staff.html\" title=\"\">including the FBI</a>) and the threat of lawsuits from American cities, brokerages and investors. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/9508185/Profile-Antony-Jenkins-the-nice-guy-of-banking.html\" title=\"\">No number of nice guys will be able to fend off that lot</a>. Conversely, blaming all this misbehaviour on the former boss, no matter how outsize his pay and personality, doesn't wash. The big issue surely is the structure of Barclays.</p> <p>The safe high-street bank Mr Jenkins came through is now welded onto a huge trading arm, Barclays Capital, which now has \u00a31.8 trillion in gross credit risk \u2013 more than the UK's annual GDP. Much of that risk has been reduced, but the bulk of it is in derivatives tied to Britain and Europe, which are the sickest parts of the world economy. In essence, Barclays has used its taxpayer backing to rack up a giant credit risk that could sink the entire country. By promoting a retail banker to front a giant trading operation, Barclays would like ministers and taxpayers to believe that it's not so bad, or so risky. This is an unconvincing plea. Far better for the government to demand Barclays splits itself in two. Taxpayers should not be used to guarantee and subsidise a bank's trading operation; nor should they be put on the hook for when it all goes wrong.</p>",
  "<p>Three serving soldiers who allegedly set up a militia group within the US army, which plotted to overthrow the government and assassinate President Obama, face the death penalty after they were arraigned on murder charges.</p> <p>Prosecutors in Georgia announced on Thursday they would seek death sentences in one of the most startling and potentially serious cases of an anti-government militia to be brought before the courts in recent years. They alleged that the soldiers stockpiled almost $90,000 worth of guns and bomb-making equipment which they planned to use to kill the president and carry out a range of other violent acts.</p> <p>The three accused \u2013 Isaac Aguigui, fellow private Christopher Salmon and sergeant Anthony Peden \u2013 are all on active duty at Fort Stewart in Georgia, home of the army's 3rd infantry division. They are accused of having killed in execution style their former army comrade, Michael Roark, 19, and his 17-year-old girlfriend Tiffany York.</p> <p>Earlier this week another serving soldier, private Michael Burnett, who was allegedly part of the militia, cut a deal with the prosecution in which he pleaded guilty to lesser charges of manslaughter and gang activity in return for turning prosecution witness. He gave evidence in which he said he was present at the murder of the couple on 4 December. </p> <p>He said he and the soldiers lured the pair into the woods near the army post on pretence they were going for gun target practice. Burnett said he saw Peden shoot York twice in the head while she was getting out of their car, and then witnessed Salmon force Roark to fall onto his knees before shooting him similarly: twice in the head.</p> <p>According to the chief prosecutor, Isabel Pauley, the militia group called itself F.E.A.R. \u2013 Forever Enduring Always Ready. The soldiers had come up with a range of wild and violent plots, including a takeover of Fort Stewart, poisoning apple orchards in Washington state and planting bombs in public parks.</p> <p>Investigators have given no indication of how serious a threat the militia posed, beyond charging each of the three soldiers with 13 counts including murder and illegal gang activity. Pauley has linked the militia to domestic terrorism, though no terrorism charges have been laid.</p> <p>She told a court in a hearing on Monday: \"This domestic terrorist organisation did not simply plan and talk. Prior to the murders in this case, the group took action. Evidence shows the group possessed the knowledge, means and motive to carry out their plans.\"</p> <p>The potential severity of the threat was dramatised in court in the Atlantic judicial circuit district where the men were arraigned on Thursday. They were brought in to face the charges separately, an hour apart, with armed officers flanking them.</p> <p>One of the many mysteries about the case is that the militia was allegedly founded and led by Aguigui, 21. Of all the accused, he held the lowest military rank, having joined the army less than two years ago and having never been in combat.</p> <p>Yet he is alleged to have persuaded superior soldiers to join him in the militia, and then ordered them to carry out the murders of Roark and York.</p> <p>At the hearing, Roark's father, Brett Roark, yelled at Salmon from his seat in the courtroom, calling the soldier a \"piece of shit.\" Then during Peden's turn in the courtroom later, York's stepfather bolted from his third-row seat in the courtroom gallery and rushed toward the suspect at the defense table.</p> <p>\"You fucking killed my kid!\" Wesley Thomas cried out before at least four deputies and officers wrestled him to the floor and handcuffed him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395448318\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346365264968/US-military-courtroom-bra-010.jpg\" alt=\"US military courtroom brawl\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wesley Thomas, the stepfather of Tiffany York, is tackled by courtroom security.

He is alleged to have paid for it out of about $500,000 he received as a life insurance payment for his wife, another serving soldier called Deirdre Aguigui.</p> <p>She died suddenly a year ago while pregnant with Aguigui's son. The soldier has not been charged with her death, but prosecutors have described it as \"highly suspicious\".</p> <p>According to the prosecution account of events, Roark was used by Aguigui as a go-between to buy the guns and bomb components. Last December, Roark left the army, allegedly arousing suspicions of the group that he was going to snitch on them; he was killed two days later.</p> <p>Now that they face the death sentence, the defendants will be provided with a new set of lawyers with experience in capital cases. Aguigui's previous defence lawyer, Keith Higgins, told the AP: \"At this point, there has been no evidence presented to prove anything. The fact that certain statements are being made does not necessarily mean these allegations are true.\"</p>",
  "<p>On the surface it was business as usual. The champagne stalls reported brisk trade at \u00a37 a glass, despite the whirling rain and wind that carried notice of winter with every spit and huff. The stadium announcer told the crowd that \"patriotism is a wonderful thing but it must be the same for every athlete\" to ah-well-yes nods and a respectful silence. And, given that dressage is a Paralympic sport that Britain dominates \u2013 think Jamaica in the men's sprints and multiply it by 10 \u2013 it was no surprise that two home riders, Lee Pearson and Natasha Baker, veteran and rookie, topped their respective leaderboards after the opening day.</p> <p>But Pearson's face after competing his first ride of the Team Test hinted at complications and frustrations. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/29/paralympics-2012-dressage-lee-pearson\" title=\"\">The 38-year-old is such an overwhelming favourite</a> to add to his tally of nine Paralympic gold medals in London that William Hill is offering odds of 1-4 that he will win another three gold medals in the dressage, dressage freestyle and team dressage, yet two challenges loom over the next few days.</p> <p>The first is from the Austrian Pepo Puch, who replaced Pearson at the top of the world rankings last year after the British rider broke his back in four places. The second, however, comes from much closer to home.</p> <p>The dressage demands restraint, poise, precision, as well as a near symbiotic relationship between rider and horse. Pearson's gelding Gentleman, however, did little on Thursday to live up to his name. He was by turns jumpy and lethargic and it took every ounce of Pearson's immense horsemanship to establish a lead for ParalympicsGB in the team event, which finishes on Sunday.</p> <p>\"I had warned everyone about Gentleman's sense of humour,\" said Pearson, half-smiling, half-grimacing. \"He warmed up perfectly and then he came into the arena and realised a few thousand people were watching him. He then lost all of his energy and I had to nurse him throughout. It was not our worst test but it was certainly not our best test.\"</p> <p>It did not help that during one of the final tests Pearson went the wrong way \u2013 an error of course \u2013 which brought his score down to 74.682. \"That was totally my fault,\" he said. \"I've been reading the test for about a week now, I read it last night before I went to the opening ceremony and then again this morning. It was just two circles and I got them the wrong way around. It was rider error.\"</p> <p>There is mission by some at these Paralympics to focus solely on sport and to airbrush everything else out. That surely is a mistake. Pearson has a backstory to defrost the most frigid of hearts, having been born with arthrogryposis \u2013 a condition that left his feet bent double around opposite knees, as if locked in a yoga position gone terribly wrong. Others have climbed different cliffs. The South African rider Marion Milne, for instance, was shot in the spine during an attempted hijacking. Watching these riders exhibit masterly control over their horses, knowing their backstory, only enhanced one's sense of awe.</p> <p>Meanwhile Puch, who competed in the three-day eventing Olympics at Athens only to suffer a spinal cord injury after being thrown from a horse in 2008, was content to lay down a marker, finishing with a score of 73.636 in what was a dry run given that Austria are not competing in the team event. \"I'm not here to beat Lee,\" he said, his voice stuttering and eyes welling up with every word. \"I'm really happy because exactly four years ago was my accident, so for me it's a pleasure to be here. You lay in a bed for six months and so to be here is great.\"</p> <p>The two riders will meet in competition proper for the first time on Saturday. And Pearson is aware of the danger Puch presents. \"There are talented riders here on top, top horses,\" he admitted. \"But I will be so proud of the person that beats me. I will be there clapping as much as anyone else.\"</p> <p>Earlier on Thursday there were handbags about sandbags after organisers made a last-minute decision to put sand around the arena because of fears of rain. That, to put it mildly, annoyed some riders who claimed they spooked their horses.</p> <p>But Baker, a 22-year-old from Uxbridge, was not affected. The youngest rider in the British team posted the highest dressage score in the morning on her horse Cabral. And while her score will not be included in the team event, she showed she is a gold medal contender in the individual events on Saturday and Monday.</p> <p>\"That was the best experience of my entire life,\" she said, her face lighting up the gloom. \"I woke up this morning and I was fine but on the bus here I was thinking 'this is actually happening' and reality sunk in a little bit.\"</p> <p>It certainly did not show. She is a star in the making. Pearson has already made it, of course. But he knows stiff tests lie ahead in his slow trot towards history.</p>",
  "<p>A federal court has struck down a Texas law requiring voters to present photo identification at the ballot box in the second ruling this week to effectively accuse the state of racial discrimination and attempting to manipulate elections.<br> In an escalating legal battle between mostly Republican-controlled states and the Obama administration over voter ID and other election laws, a panel of three judges in Washington DC found that the Texas legislation imposed \"strict, unforgiving burdens on the poor\" because of the cost and process involved in obtaining identification. The US justice department told the court that voters would have to pay for birth certificates and travel up to 250 miles to obtain ID cards. The court said this imposed a \"heavy burden\" on any voter and would be \"especially daunting for the working poor\" who are more likely to be racial minorities. The court concluded that if the law was implemented it \"will likely have a retrogressive effect\" by limiting access to the ballot box. It said that evidence submitted by Texas in support of its claim that the law was not discriminatory \u2013 and was necessary to combat voter fraud \u2013 was \"unpersuasive, invalid, or both\". The US justice department told the court there are 600,000 people registered to vote in Texas whose names are not on driving licence or state identification databases. It said the voter ID laws in Texas and other states is a blatant attempt to disenfranchise African American and Hispanic voters. On Tuesday another federal court ruled that an attempt by Texas to redraw its electoral maps was illegal because it was intended to diminish the impact of the Latino vote. In both cases, the justice department blocked the laws as in breach of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which requires those states with a history of systematic racial discrimination to seek approval from Washington for changes to electoral legislation and procedures. Rick Perry, the Texas governor, decried Thursday's ruling. \"Chalk up another victory for fraud. Today, federal judges subverted the will of the people of Texas and undermined our effort to ensure fair and accurate elections. The Obama administration's claim that it's a burden to present a photo ID to vote simply defies common sense,\" he said. But the US attorney general, Eric Holder, who has described voter ID legislation as an attempt to roll back some of the gains of the civil rights era by disenfranchising minorities, said the ruling was a victory for civil rights. \"The court's decision today and the decision earlier this week on the Texas redistricting plans not only reaffirm \u2013 but help protect \u2013 the vital role the voting rights act plays in our society to ensure that every American has the right to vote and to have that vote counted,\" he said. </p> <p>\"The justice department's efforts to uphold and enforce voting rights will remain aggressive and even-handed. When a jurisdiction meets its burden of proving that a proposed voting change would not have a racially discriminatory purpose or effect, the department will not oppose that change. When a jurisdiction fails to meet that burden, we will object.\"<br> The Texas attorney general, Greg Abbott, said he will take the issue to the supreme court, which has already endorsed the right of states to require photo IDs at the ballot box under certain conditions. \"The supreme court of the United States has already upheld voter ID laws as a constitutional method of ensuring integrity at the ballot box. Today's decision is wrong on the law and improperly prevents Texas from implementing the same type of ballot integrity safeguards that are employed by Georgia and Indiana and were upheld by the supreme court,\" Abbott said. As the judges issued their verdict in the Texas case, another court nearby was hearing a challenge from South Carolina to the justice department's blocking of its voter ID law in December. South Carolina said that it will issue identification cards free to those who do not have a driving licence, passport or other approved document. The justice department says there is still a cost involved as individuals must buy a birth certificate, if they do not already have one, in order to obtain the free ID. Critics say that the claim by South Carolina, Texas and others that voter fraud is a serious problem is not borne out, because there have been very few prosecutions. They say the Texas legislation, passed by a Republican-controlled state legislature with Perry's support is intended to discourage black and Latino voters who are more likely to support the Democratic party. Eight states have passed voter identification laws over the past year. Holder told a conference in May that there is a \"growing need to protect the voting rights of every eligible citizen\" amid a flurry of legislation and executive orders by state legislatures and governors. The meeting was told the laws are intended to prevent African Americans in particular from voting because nearly one in four black people lack photo identification. \"In my travels across this country I've heard a consistent drumbeat of concern from citizens who for the first time in their lives now have reason to believe that we are failing to live up to one of our nation's most noble ideals and some of the achievements that defined the civil rights movement now hang, again, in the balance.\" Some critics see the legal challenge by Texas and other states as a co-ordinated attempt to kill off at least parts of the voting rights act as outdated. In May, Alabama challenged the validity of the legislation over a justice department block on the redrawing of constituency boundaries. A US appeals court said in rejecting Alabama's case that the implementation of the voting rights act is legitimate because it is intended to stop racially motivated disenfranchisement which he called \"one of the greatest evils\".</p>",
  "<p>A Summer's Tale is one of three symphonic poems that Josef Suk composed in the wake of his great Asrael Symphony, which he had completed in 1906 as a memorial to his wife and to his father-in-law Dvor\u02d8\u00e1k. Jir\u00ed Be\u02d8lohl\u00e1vek and the BBC Symphony Orchestra made a fine recording of the second poem in the trilogy, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/02/suk-symphony-no-1-ripening-cd-review\" title=\"\">Ripening, for Chandos two years ago</a>, but A&#xa0;Summer's Tale, first performed in 1909, is more expansive work, in five movements lasting about 55 minutes in this performance. The language is highly wrought \u2013 late-romantic, with just occasional hints that Suk may have been aware of the musical world that Debussy had revealed \u2013 and Suk's models were presumably were Dvor\u02d8\u00e1k's late symphonic poems. But Suk's efforts lack the conciseness and the dramatic instincts of his mentor's. neither A Summer's Tale nor Prague, an evocation of the city and its history completed in 1904, really justifies its length, however sumptuous and grandiose the effects.</p>",
  "<p>This is not a good day for John Paul Rocksavage, the good cop played by Warren Brown in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00szy7c\" title=\"\"><strong>Good Cop</strong></a> (BBC1). Well he wakes up in Liverpool for a start ... hey, c'mon, I&#xa0;don't mean that, I'm not going to have to go there to apologise, am I? I mean I'd love to, some of my best friends are scousers, it's one of my favourite cities. And it looks beautiful \u2013 in a north-west kind of way \u2013 in Stephen Butchard's brooding four-part police drama, like Manchester did in Cracker ...</p> <p>Anyway, moving (swiftly) back to John Paul's bad day. While out on his morning run along the beach he bumps into a meaningful ex. She's with her (their?) daughter, he wants to chat, the ex isn't interested. Then John Paul has an unpleasant encounter with a thug called Finch (terrifyingly played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/mar/12/stephen-graham-boardwalk-empire\" title=\"\">Stephen Graham</a>) in a cafe, who snarls: \"The next copper I see on his own, I'm going to hammer him.\"</p> <p>To work then, and John Paul's first job of the day is a tragedy, a cot death. A patronising CID officer turns up to add whatever the opposite of icing to the cake is. Shit to the shit? There's just time for a Skype chat with his old dad, who's sick and bedridden and has tubes coming out of his nose, before JP along with partner and best mate Andy are called to a disturbance at a house. Turns out \u2013 it's probably no accident \u2013 that the terrifying thug Finch is there, with his gang of henchmen, and he carries out his earlier threat. It's not John Paul but Andy who gets hammered, and battered, an attack so&#xa0;shockingly vicious I found it impossible to watch. Andy is left fighting for his life.</p> <p>And that's not the end of it. John Paul later goes back to the house, finds a gun, Finch turns up, JP shoots him dead. It's hard not to cheer, until you realise what that means: that Graham won't be appearing in the the rest of Good Cop. That's one big loss; he really is a very good actor, the standout performance, a mesmerising \u2013 if terrifying \u2013 presence.</p> <p>Oh, and Andy dies, in hospital. OK,&#xa0;so we're into the next day now, but still that's a fairly full-on 48 hours for poor John Paul. Rejection, humiliation, tragic death, sickness, savage violence, lethal shooting, tragic death. Plus it's pouring with rain the whole time. They really are laying on the opposite of icing thick. It's almost Scandinavian in its bleakness. A new genre perhaps, north-west noir?</p> <p>The only respite to the misery comes when John Paul takes his top off to reveal pecs that only come from being a Thai-boxing champion (which Warren Brown is). And a comedy encounter with a comedy-scouser car thief. Hey, they put him in there, not me. Racists. Though to be fair you can probably get away with a tea leaf in a cop show.</p> <p>It's good. Not perhaps as deeply absorbing as The Killing or The Bridge; I'm not as involved with John Paul to that extent. I like the fact that he's just an ordinary bobby on the beat though, nothing special or flash. That he's flawed. All the police are \u2013 Andy is a sexist knob (though still probably doesn't deserved his hammering). There's a nice sense of foreboding hanging over it.</p> <p>Charlie Brooker would see plenty of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/aug/25/touch-of-cloth-charlie-brooker\" title=\"\">cop show cliches</a> here. The rain, and the urban grime; the troubled protagonist burdened by the weight of his backstory and personal life; the good cop who turns out not to be so good etc. But truth is, a totally true-to-life police drama would probably be mainly about paperwork. Quite mundane</p> <p>Which is what <a href=\"http://skyatlantic.sky.com/shows/british-cycling-road-to-glory\" title=\"\"><strong>British Cycling: The Road to Glory</strong></a> (Sky Atlantic) was.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Ahead of tonight's crucial Europa League qualifier between these two giants of British football, the breaking news is this: the big man's done one.</strong> Andy Carroll is off to West Ham United, after a largely unsuccessful year-and-a-half on Merseyside, time which nonetheless saw him warmly received by the red half of the city. And the blue half, but let's at least try to pretend we're above taking cheap shots. Getting rid of a popular, hard-working and - the crucial point, this - preposterously overpriced player is new Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers' first major call. A good one for both parties? One suspects Carroll is more likely to prosper under Big Sam's style of play than that of Wee Brendan, so even if the striker goes on a goal rampage down south, it'll be hard to point the finger at Liverpool's boss. Although if Hearts give his side bother this evening, Rodgers might regret the lack of a blood-and-thunder Plan B on the bench.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>So can Hearts give Liverpool bother this evening?</strong> Well, you'd not expect them to, not much. They've drawn three of their last four games, losing the other one 1-0 to a second-string Liverpool in the first leg of this tie. The Reds are unlikely to be at full strength this evening either, but they're bound to be full of confidence anyway after a superb showing against the English champions Manchester City at the weekend. Still, Hearts will take, eh, heart from their display against Liverpool at Tynecastle: Marius Zaliukas, Mehdi Taouil, Arvydas Novikovas, John Sutton and - especially - David Templeton and were <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/aug/23/hearts-liverpool-live-mbm?newsfeed=true\">all superb in the early stages of that match</a>, giving the English favourites real problems before running out of steam a wee bit. Liverpool will be looking to get this dealt with sooner rather than later, but a surprise early goal for the visitors, and you never know how this could pan out.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Kick off:</strong> 8.05pm.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Liverpool, who hope 18-year-old striker Adam Morgan, handed his first competitive start for the first team, will Do A Sterling:</strong> Reina, Kelly, Carragher, Skrtel, Downing, Henderson, Allen, Shelvey, Gerrard, Morgan, Suarez.<br>Subs: Jones, Johnson, Jose Enrique, Agger, Coates, Borini, Sterling.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Heart of Midlothian, made up of exactly the same XI who started the first leg and gave Liverpool a proper match:</strong> MacDonald, Ryan McGowan, Webster, Zaliukas, Grainger, Novikovas, Barr, Taouil, Paterson, Templeton, Sutton.<br>Subs: Hamilton, Robinson, Driver, Holt, Dylan McGowan, McHattie, Carrick.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Vladislav Bezborodov (Russia)</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Brendan Rodgers has been on to confirm that Big Andy is down at Big Sam's getting measured up.</strong> \"The club made a MONUMENTAL <em>[dramatic pause so cynics can take the sentence off in their own direction]</em> investment in Andy,\" he begins, before explaining that such a player can't fester on the bench, especially as he really wants to be out there getting involved. An honest answer, though you can't help thinking he was very, very close to one hell of a Freudian slip there.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>The teams are out!</strong> Liverpool in their new old-fashioned bright red, Hearts dressed in their second-choice all-white strip. A fine atmosphere at Anfield, just like it was up in Edinburgh last week. The players have come from the dressing rooms to the pitch along the shortest, most efficient route. I wonder if it was mapped out by Mark Peachey, who has emailed in to suggest Brendan has sent Andy around the houses a wee bit up there in our picture caption. \"The anal-map-geek-and-St Helens-dweller couldn't help but conjure up a better route for Andy Carroll out of Liverpool,\" he writes. \"Simply follow the East Lancs Road (A580) out to St Helens where he could pick up the A58 to Bolton or even Burnley should the price be right.\"</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>And we're off!</strong> Hearts get the ball rolling, and they're kicking towards the Kop in the first half, suggesting Liverpool won the toss, as they like hoofing the ball into the faces of their own fans during the second 45.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Liverpool spend most of the opening minute with the ball, passing it around awhile. Henderson nearly makes ground down the left, then the eager Morgan battles for a bit, but that's as far as Liverpool get on this particular attack. \"While I have to agree that Hearts did indeed give Liverpool a proper match in the first leg, I'd have to put it down to Liverpool - on the day at least - being so soul-destroyingly bad,\" argues Adam Allaway. \"In fact, going by that performance I'd rather watch Big-man Carroll miss a few gilt-edged chances and score the odd Euro 2012 wonder header than have to endure Jonjo Shelvy misplace a pass every two minutes and Borini running around like a headless chicken. Draw against City aside, I still think Liverpool will struggle this season, especially with Suarez up front. If John W. Henry really is interested in Sabermetrics in Football as well as Baseball, why the Uruguayan is still in the squad is beyond me.\" Brand awareness? He's a talking point for fans and neutrals alike, you've got to give him that.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> All a bit shapeless at the moment. Liverpool are closing Hearts down very efficiently, not giving the visitors a sniff so far. But they've not put much together in the opposition half yet. Downing and Suarez try an elaborate one-two down the left, but Ryan McGowan's all over it.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Decent work at either end, the game suddenly springing to life. First up, it's Hearts, Paterson latching onto a throw down the right, letting it bounce, flicking it into the air, and Le Tissiering a curling, dipping effort towards the top left. It's always going wide, but not by much. Then Suarez, up the other end, dances down the inside-right channel, but nothing comes of the burst.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Morgan is very lucky to escape a booking, with a late slide on Novikovas. The referee's obviously decided an early card won't do anyone any favours, though Hearts will quite rightly feel aggrieved about that should one of their lads see yellow soon. The ref owes them one. And young Morgan needs to calm down a bit, because he was quite feisty in the opening minutes down the left there, too.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Downing is sent clear down the left. Romping into space, he curls a magnificent cross towards Morgan, who takes the ball down with his upper arm. The referee must like the cut of the young lad's jib, because he doesn't blow for a hand ball. Luckily for Hearts, and for the concept of justice in general, Morgan can't get the ball under any sort of control, and the chance is lost.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Barr battles well down the inside-right channel and knocks the ball back for the lively Paterson, who takes another shot from the edge of the area. It's immediately blocked by Skrtel, and Liverpool clear. The home side have enjoyed most of the possession so far, but Hearts are playing with some confidence here. One senses that confidence isn't built on particularly solid ground - an early goal for Liverpool could see them crumble - but if one of these Paterson efforts was to fly in, say, we could have ourselves quite a fixture here.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> A clever little flick by Suarez down the inside-right channel isn't far from releasing the livewire Morgan, but the 18-year-old mistimes his run and is flagged offside.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> The much-maligned Downing - who has been very decent so far - skips past a wild McGowan challenge down the left and loops a dangerous cross to the far post. Morgan unselfishly nods back across the face of goal. Suarez then looks to guide a zig-zag header back into the top right corner, beating the flailing Macdonald, but Zaliukas is on hand to hack clear off the line. Brilliant play by Liverpool, but not particularly convincing defending by Hearts.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> Skrtel momentarily turns into Franz Beckenbauer, going on a long slalom down the middle of the pitch. That was quite something. The ball's pinged around across the front of the Hearts area for a limited amount of time, before Suarez gets fed up with the baroque stylings and breaks into the area down the inside-right. His attempt to bustle through sees the ball flicking up and hitting Taouil on the arm. It wasn't a penalty, though you've seen them given I suppose.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Hearts try a bit of tiki-taka themselves, the move ending with Taouil having a lash from the right-hand side of the D. He doesn't quite catch it, but the ball deflects as it bobbles through and the Kop can be heard taking a sharp intake of breath. Reina adjusts and snaffles the ball.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> Some things never change. Liverpool, with Allen and Suarez in the heart of it, spray the ball this way and that at high speed, looking to pull Hearts out of shape and work an opening. Kelly is waiting in <em>acres</em> for the pass down the right, and Hearts are looking tatty in the middle too, but Gerrard decides to have one of his trademark flays, and that's pretty much that.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Kelly, in <em>acres</em> down the right, slices a woeful deep cross into the stand on the opposite side of the pitch. Gerrard's questionable decision of two minutes ago suddenly looks far smarter than it did at the time.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Templeton and Paterson are again causing Liverpool bother down the inside-right channel. Paterson bustles into the box, and can't get a shot away. The ball breaks to Paterson, who shifts it to the left, and is clipped on the heel by a very clumsy Carragher. It's a very slight touch, but enough for a penalty. The fact that Carragher is very ostentatiously trying to get out of the way and avoid contact seems to have saved Liverpool there, but Hearts will quite rightly feel livid about that.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Morgan, down the right, has a low shot which MacDonald turns into a seven-course supper. The keeper snaffles the ball at the second attempt, with Suarez scurrying in. A sense that a goal could be coming along at any minute, though it's by no means certain the home side will be the ones who get it.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> A magnificent run by Gerrard, whose shoulders turn into yo-yos as he drops them this way and that to scoot past Webster, then two other Hearts shirts, down the inside-left and into the box. He manufactures enough space to get a shot away, but it's under his feet, scuffed, and saved well by MacDonald with a strong left arm. But for the first time, Hearts were properly opened up.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Adam Morgan puts the ball in the net for a full-debut goal, but it's chalked out. Suarez dances down the inside-right channel, reaches the byline, then zips the ball low and hard through the six-yard box. The predatory Morgan is on hand to sidefoot into the empty net, but the linesman flags: the ball's gone out of play before Suarez crossed. That was the correct decision, although you do have to wonder how the official was certain the whole ball crossed the line, with Suarez's body in the way. Still, a correct call's a correct call, so who can complain?</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Templeton, down the right, sends a high cross to the far post. Sutton gets his eyebrows on it, but can only send the ball miles left of goal. A half-decent chance for the targetman, though. The promising Templeton is having a very good game.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> Suarez flicks the ball over his own head down the inside-right channel and isn't far away from latching onto the free ball in the Hearts area. But MacDonald is out quickly to claim. The home crowd are getting a tad frustrated, which will be exactly how Hearts like it.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Anfield isn't quite nervous yet, but they'll be thinking about Hearts' goalless draw at Spurs this time last year. And unlike the north Londoners, Liverpool aren't five goals ahead in this tie.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> Templeton is in a fair bit of space down the right, but after cutting inside hits a woeful shot deep into the Kop. A chance to work Reina spurned.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> Gerrard plays a superlative ball between the Grainger and Novikovas down the right to release Kelly, but Novikovas works hard to regain the ground and blocks the resulting cross. The ball balloons out for a corner, from which nothing comes.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Carragher may not be ideal for the all-new Rodgers passing style, but he's still a fantastic meat-and-potatoes defender. Templeton is <em>this</em> close from latching onto a long ball down the left and breaking clear into the area, but Carragher isn't having any of it, and clatters the young man in a 50-50 challenge before haring off with the ball. After going straight through two more white shirts as he clanks a series of mini-clearances upfield, he eventually concedes a free kick, but Hearts can't even get the set piece past the first man and into the box. Carragher had done his job.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Official confirmation from Liverpool Football Club that Andy Carroll has joined West Ham United on a season-long loan. \"Which chapter of Moneyball features loaning out your most expensive player with no guarantee of a purchase at the end of the loan period?\" wonders Graeme Neill, not unreasonably. \"Still, the prospect of Carroll sampling London nightlife will keep the front pages of the tabloids happy.\"</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>HALF TIME: Liverpool 0-0 Heart of Midlothian.</strong> The home side wanders off to muted applause. The away side take their leave to a tumult from the away end. If Liverpool don't up their game immediately after the restart, and score an opening goal that'd put a bit of distance between the two teams, this could get fairly interesting. Don't go away.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>HEIDRUM-HAUDRUM HALF-TIME ENTERTAINMENT:</strong> In honour of Liverpool's guests this evening, ladies and gentlemen please put your hands together for Mr Andy Stewart...</p> <!-- Block 35 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4wapoQObTfA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4wapoQObTfA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><br>Actually, there was a reason the BBC canned the White Heather Club all the way back in the 1960s, wasn't there.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>And we're off again!</strong> Both teams unchanged, they start running around once Liverpool clip the ball off the blob of paint slap bang in the middle of the pitch. But first, more on that controversial route to shuttle Carroll out of Liverpool. George Wright is of the opinion that he should have stayed closer to home: Bolton. \"He wants to get to the M62 sharpish, fork left onto the M60 (N and E) and, at J15, take the M61 to junction six at Middlebrook,\" he suggests. \"Then he could learn at the breast of the original Big Man, Big Kev himself.\"</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> A couple of prods down the left by Suarez, but he can't quite break through into the area. He seems to have come out in reasonably determined mood. \"My family emigrated from Scotland in 1968, the same year the White Heather Club was cancelled,\" recalls Paul Connelly. \"Had I known that's all it would take, I would have lobbied my parents to get us onto the boat earlier.\"</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Liverpool have upped the tempo, Gerrard and Suarez combining down the right to force a corner. Skrtel is hanging around the near post, and sidefoots a volley goalwards. Grainger somehow shins it out for another corner. Shelvey has a dig from the edge of the box from the second set piece, but it's easily blocked. \"I've only just noticed the resemblance between ESPN pundit Didi Hamann and Michael Vaughan,\" yawns Phil Sawyer. \"It's not so much the slight physical resemblance (although there is one), but more the slightly stilted, slightly exaggerated way they lean forward and speak into the microphone. Okay, I admit it, that's all I've got. That first half left me seriously devoid of things to talk about.\" I feel your pain.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> A much better strike from Shelvey, who nudges the ball down the inside-left channel before unleashing a rising, grumbling shot towards the top-left corner. The ball's a wee bit wide and high, but not too far off target.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Liverpool ping it around a bit. A long period of possession ends when Henderson falls over and smothers the ball like a fleshy blanket. This half hasn't really started yet. \"Whatever happens in the second half it's been a good day for Scottish football,\" writes Simon McMahon. \"Some of our press up here (those based in the west, essentially) were predicting the death of Scottish football over the summer and now we have a team in the CL, Hearts drawing at Anfield and Motherwell doing the same in Spain. Our Olympians did us proud, Andy Murray's looking good in New York and Paul Lawrie is back in the Ryder Cup team. Never mind Andy Stewart, where's the Corries?\" You'll be distressed to hear that Levante have just taken the lead against Motherwell. There goes that nationalistic party. Will a blast of Jimmy Shand do?</p> <!-- Block 41 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2eVOZd3ebHM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2eVOZd3ebHM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>No, probably not.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> A couple of crosses from the left from Downing in quick succession. On ESPN, pundit Craig Burley can hardly contain his glee that Andy Carroll is not on the end of either of them. The nerve of Brendan Rodgers, with his pretensions beyond route-one football. How <em>dare</em> he!</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Gerrard again busies himself to win a corner down the right. From it, Skrtel looks to boom a replica of his header against Manchester City into the net, but a weak effort squirts well wide left of goal. \"Who's going to replace Big Andy?\" wonders Niall Mullen. \"Carroll was not the answer (unless the question was 'no, really, who did Liverpool spend \u00a335m on?') but this team already lacks goals without loaning a few to West Ham.\" I'm guessing this means the Clint Dempsey thing might happen now, or perhaps Theo Walcott, or maybe Daniel Sturridge, though you can't trust what you read in the papers. Or what managers say: according to the Guardian's very own Mr Jacob Steinberg, Sam Allardyce spent the entire afternoon telling him and several other assorted hacks that Carroll was categorically not coming to the Boleyn Ground. And now look. I wonder if Liverpool are about to throw a curved ball? Here, Dimitar Berbatov hasn't completed his medical at Fulham yet!</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> Morgan, down the inside right with his back to goal, sends a wondrous reverse ball high down the channel. Zaliukas heads the ball straight into the air, and nearly allows Suarez in on goal, but the Liverpool striker, going up for a header with MacDonald, is penalised for being clattered on the back of the nut by the keeper. It's young Morgan's last kick; he's replaced by Raheem Sterling.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> How many ways can Luis Suarez find to miss? He's released straight down the middle, the ball shuttled at high speed from Allen to Henderson and onto the striker. Suarez rounds Macdonald on the right, but takes too firm a touch, and from an unnecessarily tight angle clanks the ball against Webster's shins and onto the post. The ball goes out for a corner, from which ...</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> ... Suarez somehow manages to miss again from close range! This time he twists and turns down the right, reaches the edge of the six-yard box, and flashes a low, hard shot wide left of goal. He looks pained, but not half as anguished as some of the coupons in the Kop.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>67 min:</strong> Driver comes on for Sutton. \"Carroll wants to hang a right, head towards Chester, then follow the A5, A483, then A40 to Carmarthen,\" advises Matt Dony, who may or may not have the player's best interests at heart. \"He could be a Carmarthen Town legend at Richmond Park. If ever a league thrived on hoofing it up towards a big man, it's the welsh premier. Plus, cheap houses, and Metros the nightclub. Just the one, but I'm sure he'll enjoy it.\"</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Driver looks to make an instant impact, but bustling down the right can't get a shot away before being crowded out by Carragher.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Gerrard, perhaps understandably miffed at watching Suarez faff about, takes the ball off the Uruguayan down the inside left, and has a dig from distance. His shot, across the face of goal towards the bottom right, isn't far away, but always covered by MacDonald.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Henderson, not for the first time this half, slides a clever pass between the Hearts centre backs to release Suarez. The striker's entitled to go for the ball, but he's beaten to it by a millisecond by the outrushing MacDonald, who takes a clatter in the phizog for his troubles. No intent, and no lasting damage either. We move on.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> Liverpool hit the woodwork again! This really is getting silly. First Sterling dances down the inside right and is tackled well by Grainger in the area. The Kop bray for a penalty, but it's a majestically timed challenge. Liverpool are immediately coming back at Hearts, Suarez replicating Sterling's jig, getting himself tackled, Gerrard latching onto the loose ball. He batters it against the right-hand post, and out for a corner which is wasted.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> A couple of bursts upfield by Hearts, first through Templeton, then by Paterson. Both moves peter out before reaching the Liverpool area, but the home fans are getting a wee bit nervous here. \"When's the last time Liverpool scored from open play?\" wonders Bryan Tisinger. \"Their two goals against City were from a corner and a free kick. Their goal against Hearts was an own goal. My memory doesn't go any further back.\" Neither does mine, but a distant bell rings, and I'm pretty sure they have done one at some point.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Both teams make a change. Carrick comes on for Novikovas, while Borini comes on in Henderson's stead, the latter being serenaded by the away fans as part of a searing critique of Liverpool's economic policy.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Carrick makes a determined run down the inside left. Allen bundles the sub over just before he reaches the box, but for some reason known only to himself, the referee waves play on. He's made several odd decisions tonight, this ref, and Hearts have been on the wrong end of most of them.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Taouil cuts inside from the left and launches a shot goalwards. The ball rises high over the right-hand corner of the posts. A decent effort, though Reina was behind it all the way.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Barr is rightly booked for a ludicrous lunge on Allen, a carbon copy of the one Morgan executed on Novikovas early doors. Again, this referee has been kind to the home side.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> But the referee gives Hearts this decision, Sterling foolishly barging Templeton over on the edge of the Liverpool D. This free kick is in a very dangerous position - and Hearts have a real chance of taking this game towards extra time! Grainger steps up, and ...</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>84 min: GOAL!!! Liverpool 0-1 Heart of Midlothian.</strong> ... sidefoots an obvious ball straight off the top of Skrtel's head. A corner on the left. It's easily dealt with by Skrtel, who heads clear. But Templeton, down the left, cuts inside and hammers a low shot goalwards. It's straight at Reina, but the occasionally dodgy keeper showcases one of his howlers, his hands flapping like the shutters on the windows of a haunted house, allowing the ball to squirm into the bottom left corner. A dreadful piece of keeping, and well may he hold his head in despair. Templeton makes towards the Hearts fans next door to this incident; they're going wild as you'd expect.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Liverpool respond through Gerrard down the right. Grainger bundles him over, and is booked. The free kick is wasted. On the touchline, Brendan Rodgers looks monumentally depressed. But then ...</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>88 min: GOAL!!! Liverpool 1-1 Heart of Midlothian.</strong> Suarez has missed a couple of easy chances, but now look! He tears off down the left. He's on his own, but with head down, Milan Baros style, keeps going down a cul-de-sac at speed. Zaliukas looks to have moved him out wide, out of harm's way, but suddenly Suarez drops a shoulder for an extra yard and then threads a low fizzer into the bottom-right corner! Anfield erupts, albeit not in too much relief yet; another Hearts goal will send them through.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> There will be three added minutes of this. What a finish to an otherwise uneventful game! Can Hearts - and I have to say it, these brave Hearts - provide one last amazing twist?</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>90 min +1:</strong> Sterling takes a wander down the right, then feeds his captain Gerrard, who swings a ball to the far post. Webster is forced to bundle it out for a corner on the left.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>90 min +2:</strong> Nothing from the corner for the home side. Liverpool are still playing quite an expansive, attacking game here. What they would do for another Didi Hamann; now there was someone who knew how to run the clock down.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>FULL TIME: Liverpool 1-1 Heart of Midlothian.</strong> But they don't need a New Didi, with the referee blowing up a good 50 seconds before the end of the promised three extra minutes. Liverpool are through to the group stages of the Europa League, while Hearts are out. In truth, the right team are advancing, though Hearts made Liverpool work for that, giving them a real scare. The hapless Pepe Reina owes Luis Suarez a very large drink.</p>",
  "<p>Hollywood has Cannes. The independent movie industry has Sundance. Now, when it comes to promoting the little known world of conservative film-making, there is Tampa.</p> <p>In a tented enclosure just outside the convention centre where Republicans have nominated Mitt Romney as their presidential candidate, rightwing movies are being shown off and sold to an eager audience.</p> <p>At the so-called \"Liberty Plaza\" site, conservative production firm Citizens United has been showcasing a half dozen of its movies. On Wednesday Minnesota congresswoman Michele Bachmann introduced a film there called Occupy Unmasked. \"I am thrilled to be here,\" Bachmann told the crowd to a standing ovation.</p> <p>The film, which profiles the \"leftist\" Occupy protest movement as a dangerous violent threat to America, has already struck a distribution deal with Magnolia Films and will hit theatres on September 21.</p> <p>But Occupy Unmasked is just one Citizens United title being shown in Tampa. Others include The Hope and the Change, which profiles disillusioned people who voted for Barack Obama in 2008. It will be shown on US television in September.</p> <p>There is another on the constitution, one on abortion, another on the financial crisis and a lengthy feature on leading conservative women.</p> <p>The films come on the heels of conservatives' big breakthrough movie, Obama 2016, a critique of what four more years of Obama would look like. It has become the sixth most successful political documentary, bringing in more than $6m on its opening weekend to make it No 8 in the box office charts.</p> <p>\"The future is extremely bright for conservative film-making. Success breeds success,\" Citizens United president David Bossie told the Guardian.</p> <p>Indeed, Bachmann paid effusive tribute to Bossie, highlighting Citizens United's close links to many top conservative figures. \"He is the boss. We love him,\" she said.</p> <p>Nor is the impact of the group's films to be underestimated. A legal spat over a Bossie film about Hillary Clinton led to a landmark supreme court decision that ushered in limitless outside money in US elections. \"I went all the way to the supreme court to defend my right to make conservative films,\" Bossie said.</p> <p>But Bossie is not the only game in Tampa when it comes to this genre. The Rev CL Bryant, a black pastor and former official in a Texas branch of the civil rights group the NAACP, has been here touting his controversial documentary Runaway Slave.</p> <p>The movie is an exploration of the Republican party's historical links to fighting slavery \u2013 as the party of Abraham Lincoln \u2013 but then fashions it into a vitriolic attack on the modern welfare state.</p> <p>Its central point is that black Americans are beset by unemployment, crime, poverty and high incarceration rates, and thus have benefited little from a recent loyalty to the Democratic party and its defence of the welfare state.</p> <p>\"Here in 2012 are people once again needing to escape a system, needing to escape being given his master's food and his master's housing,\" Bryant said.</p> <p>Amid the promotion efforts are real signs that conservative films can hit the mainstream and provide a rightwing equivalent of liberal film-maker Michael Moore.</p> <p>The biggest conservative movie of the moment is Dinesh D'Souza's documentary 2016: Obama's America. The movie has been a huge hit. Despite starting out showing in a single cinema in Houston, it is now playing on more than a thousand screens nationwide and has taken more than 10 million dollars at the box office.</p> <p>That makes it the highest grossing conservative film of all time. In Tampa there have been free showings for delegate-goers, and the movie has been playing to packed houses. The film posits the theory that the president is motivated by an anti-colonial fervour inherited from his Kenyan father.</p> <p>Critics have pointed out many flaws in the movie's thesis, not least of which is that Obama spent little time with his father after his parents split up and his father moved back to Kenya.</p> <p>There are also obvious flaws in some of the other movies. The Hope and the Change slams Obama for taking expensive holidays and enjoying playing golf, contrasting that with the hardscrabble lives of ordinary Americans.</p> <p>Yet the Republican alternative to Obama owns Cayman Island bank accounts, has multiple homes and a garage with its own car elevator. In Citizens United's constitutional film there are warnings that Obama is a socialist: something few political scientists seriously believe.</p> <p>But of course, being fair and balanced is not the point of these movies. Like Moore's films they have a firm point of view and they stick to it. Yet not all the conservative movies are documentaries.</p> <p>Harmon Kaslow, who has worked on films like hit horror comedy Dog Soldiers, was also in Tampa. Kaslow's latest film is Atlas Shrugged: Part II, the second half of a full-length dramatisation of Ayn Rand's famous objectivist novel. Kaslow showed clips to hundreds of Ron Paul supporters at a festival in honour of the libertarian-leaning Texan congressman. </p> <p>He told the Guardian that audiences were lapping up the film's message of heroic self-interested businessmen and the evils of state control.</p> <p>\"The audience here is educated on these things. They believe in free markets and in limited government.\"</p>",

  "<p>The government's proposal to license farmers and landowners to shoot badgers at night is, in our expert opinion, fundamentally flawed both scientifically and morally, and does not represent a credible long-term solution to the problem of bovine tuberculosis.</p> <p>In January this year, concerned that the proposed shooting of thousands of free-running badgers may constitute a breach of the convention on the conservation of European wildlife and natural habitats (Bern Convention, to which the government is a signatory), Humane Society International/UK lodged a formal complaint with Bern in Strasbourg.</p> <p>Bern has confirmed that there are sufficient grounds for it to consider the complaint. However, we understand there is a strong possibility that the government may proceed with the cull before the Bern Convention is due to consider the matter.</p> <p>If, as it states, the government takes seriously its responsibilities to wildlife and respects the authority of the Bern Convention, it is logical that any badger cull be delayed until after the Convention has decided whether or not it might constitute a breach. In addition, and according to the government's own policy documents, starting and then stopping a cull could expose farmers and their cattle to the unnecessary risk of increasing localised TB outbreaks.

  "<p>Even with a new film to sell, Guy Maddin is not your standard-issue eager-to-please director. \"So many people are baffled,\" he says, with well-practised irony. \"The movie will be crystal-clear upon your third viewing.\" This is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/143131/keyhole\" title=\"\">Keyhole</a>, Maddin's ninth full-length film since 1988; and against all the odds it's secured a theatrical release in the UK. Most of Maddin's work simply doesn't get to Britain, so resolutely has he followed his own path.</p> <p>If you know him at all, it is probably for his ballet film <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYroFjMvbWk\" title=\"\">Dracula: Pages from a Virgin Diary</a>, or just possibly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/125068/my.winnipeg\" title=\"\">My Winnipeg</a>, his heartfelt docu-essay tribute to his Canadian hometown. More energetic cineastes may remember 2003's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/97578/saddest.music.in.the.world\" title=\"\">The Saddest Music in the World</a>, Maddin's most determined shot at the mainstream, an elaborate parody musical starring Isabella Rossellini. The truly dedicated will have sought out <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzHKR7zbCE8\" title=\"\">Tales from the Gimli Hospital</a>, his 1988 feature debut, set in the remote Canadian settlement of Gimli, some 50 miles north of Winnipeg. All share Maddin's preoccupations: a swirl of phantasmagoric imagery and cut-up surrealism, filtered through his particular brand of cinema ancestor-worship (German silents, 50s Technicolor, big-hat noir) and occasional shafts of very daft humour. Clarity of narrative and ease of access is not high on the agenda; Maddin would appear to be the closest living counterpart we have to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_%28film_director%29\" title=\"\">Jack Smith, the underground legend of Flaming Creatures renown</a>.</p> <p>In the flesh, the 56-year-old Maddin turns out to be an avuncular, energetic talker, not afraid to discuss his elaborate concepts in detail. Keyhole, it emerges, was made as a result of \"a bunch of dreams I was having that have really been haunting me\". \"Melancholy dreams,\" he says, \"where I revisit my past: dead relatives and homes that have meant a lot to me, particularly my childhood home. I can remember them far better in the dream than I can in waking hours.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395427677\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346339385121/Guy-Maddin-001.jpg\" alt=\"Guy Maddin\" width=\"210\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guy Maddin: 'Whether I want them to or not, my movies end up disjointed and \u00addisconnected and discontinuous.'

Keyhole mashes together noir-gangster imagery with Homer's Odyssey \u2013 \"The Odyssey is a story witnessed through the eyes of a son who idolises his father as a great warrior, and I had a childish notion of a father as a strong alpha-male gangster\" \u2013 and sets up a frankly bizarre and sketchy-to-the-point-of-nonexistent storyline of a hoodlum journeying from room to room in a seemingly haunted house. \"New-age friends of mine say I should say goodbye to my father and wrap him up in a blanket and put him in the ground for ever. But I don't want to. Since we all live in the past and present simultaneously, and the past makes us who we are in the present, destroying it is such a cockeyed notion.\"</p> <p>But Keyhole's tenuous relationship with narrative logic, or even moment-to-moment comprehensibility, means it's perhaps a tad on the self-indulgent side? \"Whether I want them to or not, my movies end up disjointed and disconnected and discontinuous. I feel the only way I can get away with such loosey-goosiness, even for my own judge and jury, if it's genuinely coming from some place honest.\"</p> <p>Maddin can't resist a little facetiousness. \"People have been telling me for years I do myself no favours by making movies that are difficult to classify, so I went all out to make a genre piece to push it through to blockbuster domination.\" He cites the unexpected success of the Dracula film as a forerunner: \"People had an idea of what they'd get, and they got it. People showed up for it. It was supposed to be a one-off thing for TV and ended up getting a theatrical release. The advice I had been given for decades was right: working in the genre mode really helped.\"</p> <p>Still, Maddin wasn't about to give up his habitual idiosyncrasies. He staged <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/802202\" title=\"\">\"collage parties\"</a> to help generate script ideas for Keyhole: \"I invited the best young up-and-coming scene-grabbing artists, in various cities. I would prime their pumps with a few words \u2013 'electric chair', things like that \u2013 and supplied a stack of old melodrama magazines, a stack of porn, and a few kegs of bourbon. We embarked on a very peaceful and therapeutic and yet disruptive process of snipping paper into blizzards of nipples.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/axxhRAuGC5c?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"295\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/axxhRAuGC5c\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Maddin says he sold a few of the collages to help finance the film: \"I should have kept them, on the off-chance they'd go up in value, but I needed the money pretty badly.\" This underlines the fact that Maddin occupies a special niche, midway between the cinema world and fine art. Money seems to be increasingly on his mind, and explains why he is cropping up so often in galleries. \"I never thought about money in the past; but I decided when I turned 50 I was going to have to. I have no savings, no retirement plan, and the art world just seems wealthier. I started to be more serious about it four or five years ago, and I liked my initial sorties there.\"</p> <p>You also get the sense that the art world is as accepting of film-makers as cinema is of artists: Maddin mentions <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/apichatpong-weerasethakul\" title=\"\">Apichatpong Weerasethakul</a>, but he might just as well have taken cues from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/mar/26/patrick-keiller-robinson-institute-review\" title=\"\">Patrick Keiller </a>or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2007/sep/20/art.popandrock\" title=\"\">Matthew Barney</a>. For the past year or so, Maddin has been working on a film \"seance\" project called Hauntings (or <a href=\"http://www.centrepompidou.fr/Pompidou/Manifs.nsf/0/100E97AF7A91DF75C12579A00050073F?OpenDocument\" title=\"\">Spiritismes</a>, when it fetched up at the Pompidou in Paris earlier this year). The idea is that Maddin and his cohorts would \"contact\" the ghost of a lost film \u2013 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladies_of_the_Mob\" title=\"\">William Wellman's Ladies of the Mob</a>, for example, or <a href=\"http://criterioncorner.tumblr.com/post/19638293467/udo-kier-being-possessed-by-mikio-naruses-the\" title=\"\">Mikio Naruse's The Strength of a Moustache</a> \u2013 and then recreate/reimagine it as if under the influence of the cosmic ectoplasm. It's expensive, says Maddin, at half a million dollars a go, but he puts on a good show.</p> <p>Maddin says he tried shooting some of the seances simultaneously with Keyhole, on the same set (\"I built a little studio system where I deployed eight guest film-makers from various parts of my past to shoot in different rooms\"); but Maddin's attempt to be the Louis B Mayer of art cinema had to be abandoned after \"the demands of the two projects started hurting each other\". In practice, this meant actorly rows: Maddin giggles at the memory of his Keyhole stars Jason Patric and Udo Kier storming off set after the latter \"started screaming out as Kaiser Wilhelm in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kaiser,_the_Beast_of_Berlin\" title=\"\">The Beast of Berlin</a> in one corner while Jason was trying to achieve some serene, wrathful interiority on Keyhole in another\".</p> <p>Maddin remains an unrepentant avant-gardist, a film-maker committed to walking the untrodden ways, far from commercial gain and sobbing acclaim. Keyhole is no exception. \"I&#xa0;wanted to make something viewers could let themselves go with and just listen to, like a piece of music. I don't mean listen with their ears, I mean listen with their eyes; and feel no need to understand it, but just take it in.\" It may not be to everyone's taste, but cinema is all the richer for his trying.</p> <p>\u2022 Keyhole is released in the UK on 14 September</p>",
  "<p>Darius is the head trimmer at <a href=\"http://www.thelegendsbarbershop.com/site/node/1\" title=\"\">Legend's, a smart London barber</a> that specialises in traditional wet shaves. Before he came to the UK, Darius trained in Poland, learning how to perform a cut-throat shave by smothering an&#xa0;inflated balloon in shaving foam and then removing it with a single blade.</p> <p>Awaiting his razor-sharp skills are four Cambridge lads sporting varying degrees of bum fluff. Keyboardist Gus (a little shadow above his top lip), guitarist Gwill (a coating of wispy blond pelage), drummer Thom (early-onset beard) and singer Joe (as close to clean shaven as you can get with an old disposable on the seventh go of a disposable Wilkinson Sword).</p> <p>They are Alt-J, and by almost all accounts they are the most successful new British band of the year. Their album went top 20, the single is all over the radio and they are now odds-on favourite to win the Mercury music prize, even though nominations are a week away from being announced. They are playing sold-out shows in the US, and have charted in Belgium, France and the Netherlands. At a time when guitar music is in the doldrums, they have come from nowhere to buck the trend.</p> <p>Yet while most British bands spend years slogging through magazine interviews, starting fake tiffs with other bands for column inches and touring the nation's Barflys in hope of some elusive buzz, Alt-J have somehow managed to find success without fame. The group's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg6BwvDcANg\" title=\"\">first single, Tessellate</a>, an onomatopoeic puzzle of angular beats and pointed sexual advances, became a radio hit before anyone knew who they were. This is probably the first time you've seen their photograph.</p> <p>\"We've got this far with pretty much nobody knowing anything about us,\" says keyboardist Gus.</p> <p>Gwill is first in the barber's chair. He is the baby face of the band, all black-rimmed emo glasses and blond floppy hair. His face is smothered in pink shaving foam and Darius gets to work with the blade.</p> <p>\"Gwill uses quite a lot of long words in interviews,\" Joe warns me when he's out of earshot. \"He keeps talking about our songwriting style being nomadic or rhizomatic, but I don't think he knows what that means.\"</p> <p>Much of my conversation with Alt-J is almost town-planning meeting in tone. Instead of answering questions, they often descend into discussions of whether they're giving a boring answer and what another band would say. At times I think we are all part of a meta in-joke, undermining the whole charade of a music interview.</p> <p>\"We only have two rock'n'roll stories,\" says frontman Joe, trying to be helpful. \"The first one is that we were chucked out of a hotel for peeing off a balcony. Well, I wasn't personally, but our guitarist Gwill was. In fact I was the one suggesting he just went upstairs and did it in his own hotel room, but he ignored me and just started \u2026 hosing it. The other one is we were doing a gig in Sicily and I met some people and went back to their house and I fell asleep and missed my flight the next day.\"</p> <p>Joe sighs, realising his tales don't pack the punch he was hoping for. \"We are actually pretty tame. We have a lovely collection of magazines onboard when we're on tour.\"</p> <p>Alt-J are far more endearing than they realise. Their genuine disregard for the clich\u00e9s of being in a band means conversation is relaxed, while their rarefied wealth of music, film and TV geekery makes for good gags. They find the idea of sleeping with fans refreshingly garish and are \"just too knackered\" to drink every night. They're not apologists for their middle-class background either. During the course of the interview we discuss how intimidating roadies can be, what happens when you've nothing to eat but Kettle Chips and how it can be quite nice to go to a restaurant alone when you've got something to read.</p> <p>(They're also obsessed with the Guardian. \"What's Alexis Petridis like?\" asks Gus, when we nip outside for a cigarette. \"I've always thought that we'd be really good friends, we've just got a lot in common. We both shop at Folk!\")</p> <p>Do they ever want to have a night of excess? \"I suppose the thing is that we like to be polite,\" says Joe, \"and you can't do that when you've just done a fat line of ket before an interview.\"</p> <p>It was the same when they met at Leeds University. While most of their friends spent three years getting smashed and dancing to electroclash, they formed a little bubble in their student house. \"Oh God, we didn't go out much,\" remembers Gus. \"We weren't socialites at all. We'd just keep working on the record.\"</p> <p>\"We're our harshest critics,\" agrees Joe. \"We're not one of those bands that bash things out really quickly. We didn't want to look like morons, so we spent ages on the little things.\"</p> <p>Was there a concerted effort to make something that would get on the radio?</p> <p>\"Not at all. We don't even know where the choruses are. Our producer helps us with that! We're more like artists, he's more like a designer. We make the print and then he puts in on a scarf and sells it in the V&amp;A gift shop.\"</p> <p>The result of five years' hard work is <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/alt-j/sets/an-awesome-wave\" title=\"\">a record that sounds more like a mature \"big ideas\" third album</a> than something a bunch of unsigned students recorded in&#xa0;their digs. Certainly there's a pop immediacy, but it's underpinned by complex scoring, well-crafted hooks and some slightly esoteric lyrical flourishes. One song, Taro, is about the death of 20th-century war photographers <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Capa\" title=\"\">Robert Capa</a> (who stepped on a mine in Indo-China) and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerda_Taro\" title=\"\">Gerda Taro</a> (who was run over by a tank during the Spanish civil war.) \"It was only after reading all this that I discovered she was his love interest and they were engaged,\" says Joe. \"I liked those two and that story. That really gripped me and I really trawled through as much as I could to get a good song out of it.\"</p> <p>Conversation dies down as the four of them relax into the shaves. \"This feels like a dog licking your face,\" says a mummified Joe from underneath a&#xa0;hot towel. When it's over I give their faces a prod. They are undeniably silky.</p> <p>Of course, if Alt-J do win the Mercury, they can kiss their nonchalance towards public persona goodbye. The hype machine will come careering through the door, wondering why it wasn't consulted in the first place. But in the meantime, they can continue to muddle along as they are: affable, a bit posh and fine with it.</p> <p>\"I feel so relaxed,\" announces Gus, smoking a post-shave menthol cigarette outside the barber's. \"I'm going to start&#xa0;getting shiatsu when I get back to&#xa0;Cambridge.\"</p>",
  "<p>So Nick Clegg thinks he can squeeze the Lib Dems on to the already overcrowded centre ground of British politics (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/28/nick-clegg-thorny-path-out-of-rose-garden\" title=\"\">Fighting talk: Clegg's thorny path out of the Rose Garden</a>, 29 August). Who on earth is the \"small 'l' liberal voter\" whose support he seeks? A voter who opposes the commercialisation of the NHS and the removal of local accountability from education; but only a bit. Someone who believes the financial world has to be brought back under regulatory control; but only slightly. A person who supports constitutional reform; as long as it doesn't change things too much.</p> <p>Mr Clegg, there is no such animal. You and the Orange Book quasi-Tories seemingly in the ascendancy in your party, will find that out at the next election. <br><strong>Les Farris</strong><br><em>South Petherton, Somerset</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008So, the deputy prime minister admits the current economic problem \"begs big questions\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/28/nick-clegg-emergency-tax-britains-weathiest\" title=\"\">Clegg: we need rich to pay an emergency tax</a>, 29 August). How about these for starters? Why has it taken over two years of austerity for him to reach the conclusion that \"we need to hard-wire fairness in what we do\"? Where was he when the last budget was discussed? Could the facts that his popularity with his party is at an all-time low, that his leadership is under threat, that his main rival is making populist noises about state ownership of banks, and that party conference time is almost here have anything to do with his sudden \"fears for the cohesion of Britain\"? <br><strong>Bernie Evans</strong> <br><em>Liverpool</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Taxing the rich is easily said, but it is hard to get many who are comfortably off, or soon expect to be, to admit that they may undeservingly be so. But if those that have inherited, not laboured for, large sums of money, homes etc were to pay more tax on those assets, we could be out of the woods fairly quickly, with no need for an emergency tax. This would include many quite ordinary people who feel that what their parents or grandparents have earned, and houses whose value has increased vastly without any effort on their part, can become theirs without question or much penalty. I write as one who is benefiting from an inheritance. What did I do to deserve it ?<br><strong>Richard Wilson</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Nick Clegg could enlist traditional Liberal support for a land value tax (which is also a Labour tradition: the Liberals attempted to introduce LVT in 1909, Labour in 1931). With \u00a34 trillion of our national wealth of \u00a36.8tn accounted for by property, we are now in a big enough economic crisis to warrant tapping the money residing in the national house price bubble, but in a controlled way, rather than waiting till after a house price crash, when it won't be there to target.<br><strong>DBC Reed</strong><br><em>Northampton</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008The solution is simple. Reverse the proposed cut in income tax for those earning over \u00a3150,000 a year and reform council tax to split bands G and H to create a fairer local tax. At the moment, properties worth \u00a3200,000 pay nearly 40% more in council tax than properties worth \u00a3100,000. There is no reason why properties worth \u00a32m should not pay 40% more than those worth \u00a31m. <br><strong>Ines Newman</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Now that Martin Kettle is trying to get Nick Clegg dumped as Lib Dem leader in favour of Vince Cable (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/29/lib-dems-ruthless-nick-clegg-loser\" title=\"\">Comment</a>, 30 August), please, please give Cable more scrutiny than was given to Clegg, so we can see what he really stands for, including his backing of the coalition in all its key aspects while muttering ineffectually in private in order to maintain progressive credibility. For far too long Cable has been treated by those who should know better as some sort of umpire above the political fray, turned to for supposedly impartial analysis, despite his continuing participation in this \"omnishambles\" of a government. <br><strong>Giles Oakley</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Deborah Duffin (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/29/we-are-angry-no-one-listening?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 30 August) speaks for millions of people who feel disenfranchised by, among other things, the way political parties response to legitimate protest is to shuffle the deck and put a new face on the next batch of election leaflets. It is time to ask whether the Lib Dems would be better to stand for what they believe in and to place their trust in the people rather than the Tories (or Vince Cable). There will be a future after the next election. How much the Lib Dems have a say in it, perhaps in coalition with Labour, depends on how they act now.<br><strong>William Bradshaw</strong><br><em>Birkby, Huddersfield</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008No amount of posturing, sugar-coated fantasy intentions should distract the electorate from judging Clegg and the Lib Dems on the widespread suffering they played an integral role in inflicting. <br><strong>Tim Matthews</strong><br><em>Luton, Bedfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Suppose Labour had offered enthusiastic support of a wealth tax. The Conservatives would have been isolated and perhaps there would have been a real chance of it succeeding and so starting to reverse the growth in division between rich and poor. Labour's rubbishing of Clegg's suggestion will come at what cost? How can Labour criticise Lib Dem support for Tory cuts if they won't back the Lib Dems in pushing for an alternative? It continues the process whereby rightwing economic arguments win by default because the counter arguments are politically impossible to make.<br><strong>Matthew Huntbach</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008The very wealthy who threaten to leave these shores have not been much help to the economy in the last four years. Perhaps the government should experiment and send them abroad, and then see if our economy improves. It certainly can't get any worse.<br><strong>David Watson</strong><br><em>Nutley, East Sussex</em></p>",

Ohio is perhaps the most crucial state in the election, its 18 electoral college votes fiercely contested by both parties who know those votes could be needed to squeeze past the 270 required for victory. No Republican has ever won a presidential election without taking the state, and McPherson was well aware of Romney's need to appeal to his fellow Ohioans.</p> <p>\"I want to hear Governor Romney continue to talk about what he's been talking about for this past year and a half,\" he said. \"And that is how he is going to turn this country around and create jobs and strengthen this economy so that America can return to the glory that it has possessed for so many centuries.\"</p> <p>It is expected to be close in Colorado, too. The Centennial State went to George W Bush in 2000 and 2004 <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/ecalculator?hpt=po_r1#_ \">but swung to the Democrats in 2008</a>, with Obama winning by almost 9%. </p> <p>Bob Beauprez knows as much as anyone about the politics of the state \u2013 the Colorado delegate, and former congressman, was the Republican nominee for governor in 2006, losing out to Democrat rival Bill Ritter.</p> <p>\"Mitt Romney has got to make the connection with people that he can not only be our nominee and be a credible candidate, but that he can fix our economy that's been struggling so badly,\" Beauprez said.</p> <p>\"I like Mitt Romney because of his practical experience. Everywhere he's been in life he's been a fix-it kind of guy. He's turned around the Olympics, he turned around Massachusetts, he did it in the private sector when he was at Bain Capital.\"</p> <p>Beauprez said he knows Romney personally, and said he is a \"remarkably humble man\".</p> <p>\"That's his background, that's the family that he came from, that's the way he's lived his life. Sometimes people see that humbleness as a detachment. I think it's a misread of Mitt and Ann Romney and I think you're going to see some of that more human side, the warmer side, at this convention.\"</p> <p>DeLena May, from Gainesville, Florida \u2013 \"we have 50,000 students there, most of them liberal, unfortunately\" \u2013 is another delegate from a crucial swing state. Obama won Florida by 2.82% in 2008, and it is no coincidence that Republicans chose the state for the convention.</p> <p>\"What I want to hear from Mitt Romney is 'We're gonna straighten this crap out,'\" May said. \"I'm a business person, I'm a person who lived the American dream and my children have no chance to live the American dream in this socialised mess that has evolved in the last 20 years or so. I know that Mitt Romney will be able to straighten it out because he's as conservative as I am. And he understands what it takes to fix things that are broken \u2013 primarily national healthcare.\"</p> <p>Pennsylvania has been Democrat territory in all recent elections, but is seen as having an outside chance of swinging for Romney given that the vote there tends to be close to the national average. For Margo Hunt, from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Romney needs to describe how he will \"help our economy, keep our armed forces strong, and reverse what's going on in this country\".</p> <p>\"We have got to save our country,\" Hunt added, with scrapping \"Obamacare\" high on her list. Romney has pledged to repeal it on the first day of his presidency.</p> <p>In addition to persuading independents in swing states, however, Romney must also use his speech to appeal to Republicans in GOP strongholds for help with campaigning and, crucially, donations.</p> <p>\"I want to hear from Governor Romney the good things he's going to do for our country to bring us back to less government and to have the great leadership that I know he can do,\" said Lisa Ritchie, from Witchita, Kansas \u2013 one of those strongholds. Ritchie, who had dressed as a witch \"to showcase our great state\", runs two businesses, selling dancewear and providing \"dinner theatre\", making her exactly the kind of small business owner that Romney tries to appeal to when he talks of lower taxes and less government interference.</p> <p>\"The economy is just sorry right now,\" she said. \"And I have a couple of small businesses and I don't want him to tell me that I have to pay so much if I have 50 employees \u2026 there's so many things.\"</p> <p>Georgia delegate Ginger Howard, from Atlanta, campaigned for Rick Perry during the Iowa caucuses, but said she was \"100%\" behind Romney now, and looking forward to his address on Thursday night. \"I think that he needs to really show the sharp contrast between his vision and the vision of the current president, and talk about how far even more in debt [we are] than we were four years ago.\" </p> <p>\"He needs to lay out his plan, he needs to make it very clear, he needs to articulate it and he also needs to personalise himself.\"</p> <p>Jerry Miller, from Kentucky, was roaming the convention floor on Wednesday night, looking to collect pin buttons from as many different states as possible as unnoticed luminaries took to the stage to heap praise on the 2012 nominee. \"Mitt Romney has to show that he has a plan, that its not just rhetoric, or who do you like the most,\" Miller said. \"The most important issue is jobs and the economy, without a doubt. Many of us are concerned about our debt.\"</p> <p>As for his button collection, Miller had pins from 12 of 50 states as of Wednesday evening. \"I must have met people from about 24 states, but many people don't have buttons\", he said. Mitt Romney will be hoping for a higher conversion rate come 6 November.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's most powerful advertising man, Sir Martin Sorrell, is a step closer to relocating the headquarters of WPP back to London from Dublin, with a shareholder vote to seal the move due in December.</p> <p>Sorrell, chief executive of the world's largest advertising and marketing group, said the board approved the move, leaving shareholder consent as the final hurdle.</p> <p>He moved WPP's tax domicile to Ireland in 2008 in protest at the prospect of \"double taxation\" of overseas profits \u2013 once abroad and again in the UK.</p> <p>\"The UK coalition government has now enacted legislation covering the taxation of foreign profits from 2013,\" said Sorrell . \"This will mean that, at least for the life of this government, there will be no tax cost to the group by returning its headquarters to the United Kingdom from Ireland.\"</p> <p>But Sorrell was critical of the government's wider tax strategy after this week's call by Nick Clegg for a wealth tax.</p> <p>\"The government's troubles started with the budget,\" he said. \"One of the budget provisions was to move the income tax marginal rate down from 50% to 45%. From an entrepreneurial view it didn't make sense. If you want to improve entrepreneurial activity, reduce the rate of capital gains tax. Don't mess about with income tax \u2026 The government has shot itself in the foot. \"</p> <p>Sorrell said investors will vote on the move at a WPP extraordinary general meeting planned for \"early December\".</p> <p>He said: \"If shareholders think it is a bad idea they will vote it down. But I don't think they will.\"</p> <p>When WPP moved to Dublin in 2008 it was with the support of 99% of shareholders, Sorrell said, indicating there would almost certainly be overwhelming support for the board's decision this time.</p> <p>Sorrell also addressed the issues raised following WPP's annual general meeting in June, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/13/wpp-shareholders-vote-against-sorrell-pay?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">nearly 60% of shareholders voted to reject his \u00a36.8m annual pay packet</a>. He also received a \u00a35.6m share windfall under WPP's leadership equity acquisitions plan.</p> <p>According to corporate governance group Manifest, the protest was the largest shareholder rebellion at a blue chip company since 90% voted against Sir Fred Goodwin's pension arrangements at Royal Bank of Scotland in 2009.</p> <p>Sorrell admitted that he \"misjudged the mood of shareholders\", but remained defiant about the need for British companies to pay well to remain competitive in the global marketplace.</p> <p>\"We do operate in a highly competitive environment, an extremely competitive environment particularly from a salary and compensation point of view,\" he told the BBC. \"If we want WPP to be successful or, frankly, if we want more WPPs in the UK we have to get a better understanding of what's necessary.\"</p> <p>He added: \"There are arguments on both sides and it is a question about what we really want at the end of the day in terms of competitive enterprises.\"</p> <p>WPP's board \u2013 led by Philip Lader, the former White House deputy chief of staff who has chaired the company for 11 years, and Jeffery Rosen, the investment banker who heads its remuneration committee \u2013 has been meeting investors to discuss the revolt over Sorrell's pay and reach a compromise on future payouts.</p> <p>\"The consultation is ongoing, we will see how it comes out,\" said Sorrell. \"It is very difficult to get a unified view from anyone, it is like trying to distil many views, it can be hard to come to a conclusion. What happens to me happens to others as well. At the end of the day the critical factor will be do we want WPP to remain competitive?\"</p> <p>On Thursday, WPP reported a 7% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a3358m in the first half of 2012, but lowered its forecast for full-year revenue growth after a slowdown in June and July. WPP downgraded its forecast of 4% revenue growth for the year to 3.5%, although Sorrell cautioned that it was not a sign the company had concerns about a major slowdown in the global advertising industry.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hi, Noah! What's it like in Belfast? </strong></p> <p>I'm in Brighton. <strong><em>(1)</em></strong></p> <p><strong>Ah sorry. For the surfing? </strong></p> <p>Not all Aussies surf. But a few reckless types do here. You can <a href=\"http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/8133489.Surfers_warned_over_Brighton_West_Pier_wreckage/\" title=\"\">get waves off the ruins of the old west pier</a>, where the steel girders stick out.</p> <p><strong>You've lived over here for ages. </strong></p> <p>Almost 17 years. I still call Australia home but I'm used to English life. And in a way Australia feels quite foreign to me now, both in an exotic sense but also when you've been away from somewhere for a long time, it's not so much that the place has changed but it's a different era. You're nostalgic for that.</p> <p><strong>You're a patron <em>(2)</em> of this year's </strong><a href=\"http://www.filmfestaustralia.org.uk/#/ffa-2012/4567157855\" title=\"\"><strong>Australian film festival</strong></a><strong>. What do your duties involve?</strong></p> <p>Not much, really, to tell you the truth. Having my name on it, for whatever that's worth, and occasionally talking to people like yourself. I'm doing it out of some sort of patriotic sense of duty. It's a great festival and they're all doing it voluntarily this year. And the industry is important. Lots of Australians go to Hollywood after making a few films. It's a really good training ground, partly because the budgets are small, so they have to rely on a decent script and acting and plotting rather than throwing a bunch of special effects at it.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel like a elder statesman? </strong></p> <p>I felt old. I feel elder. Being an ambassador isn't a title I'm particularly comfortable with because I'm not generally a diplomatic personality type.</p> <p><strong>There seems to be a bit of a grisly new wave of Aussie cinema <em>(3)</em>.</strong></p> <p>Yeah, that's probably a generational thing. It's like when, say, Lock Stock came out here, everyone wanted to make East End gangster films, and one of the definitive films for those Aussies is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/84937/chopper\" title=\"\">Chopper</a>. Which is superb and so when you have a film like that, it makes producers more comfortable with financing darker scripts. And undoubtedly those scripts are a reflection of a certain aspect of Australia. Prior to&#xa0;that there was an era of big landscapes and horses.</p> <p><strong>You were in </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/141656/red-dog\" title=\"\"><strong>Red Dog</strong></a><strong>, too: that was pretty popular.</strong></p> <p>Well, people like dogs, don't they?</p> <p><strong>Do you? </strong></p> <p>They're alright. Take or leave em. I'm more of a cat person.</p> <p><strong>Is it right that before your first films <em>(4)</em>, you wanted to join the army?</strong></p> <p>That was my one real ambition, and I got it from reading war comics. I think they have a magazine aimed at under 15s and they did a study and a high percentage who joined had read it, which is a little scary. But that idea faded when I became a teen and I realised I didn't really like getting up early and being told what to do.</p> <p><strong>And you play music <em>(5)</em> and paint<em> (6)</em>, too.</strong></p> <p>I play about once a month in pubs and I've got a little studio. I do lots of different things but I don't do them with any great ambition or plan to succeed. Just in the past couple of years I've tried to be a bit more serious. You have a lot of time on your hands as an under-employed actor and I don't like sitting round doing nothing and at a certain point if you're not doing anything with your hobby it becomes a dull. Even if you're not having any particularly great success it's good to get things out there it legitimises it a bit more.</p> <p><strong>But your music is quite successful. </strong></p> <p>It depends how you define success. If&#xa0;it's by making money, it's very unsuccessful but it's almost impossible to make money from music unless you are a chart-topping global sensation or a super-cute boy band, or their manager, and you have a good line in ring tones.</p> <p><strong>Could you make your songs into ringtones? </strong></p> <p>Not pleasant ones.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIrFfwc9BN4\" title=\"\"><strong>Your song Fuck You</strong></a><strong> <em>(7)</em> is pretty catchy. Do you ever hear people singing it? </strong></p> <p>I never have, it's a shame. I had my first singalong experience the other night \u2013 I&#xa0;did a cover of Like a Virgin and these Aussie girls joined in. So I felt like a genuine pub entertainer. It's better than being all introverted and just doing songs about a very sad time in my life and all that crap. It was good to&#xa0;have a singalong.</p> <p><strong>Do you ever feel an affinity with Madonna?</strong></p> <p>Not really.</p> <p><strong>You once said that there are </strong><a href=\"http://www.tonedeaf.com.au/features/interviews/108333/noah-taylor-and-the-sloppy-boys.htm\" title=\"\"><strong>four types of songs</strong></a><strong>: the falling in love song; the you don't love me song; the it's all over song; and the I want to hop in your pants song. What's your favourite? </strong></p> <p>Everyone likes falling in love songs best. But very chirpy love songs if you're devastated are generally unwelcome. I&#xa0;really like country and western songs <strong><em>(8)</em></strong> because they're complete literary masterpieces. You've got to have three acts; you can't have just whatever as you can with rock songs. Country has a real discipline.</p> <p><strong>Do you get recognised a lot? </strong></p> <p>I think you've overestimating my place in the world.<strong><em> (9)</em></strong> A few people think I'm <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Mendelsohn\" title=\"\">Ben Mendelsohn</a> <strong><em>(10)</em></strong>. I was mistaken for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/prince\" title=\"\">Prince</a> once in Africa when I had a&#xa0;moustache.</p> <p><strong>Did you correct them?</strong></p> <p>I felt it was the right thing to do. Sometimes someone will come up to me and say \"Tomb Raider\" <strong><em>(11)</em></strong>, which always makes me&#xa0;feel good. Most people are pleasant and I try to be pleasant back. I've occasionally gone up to someone whose work I admire on some level and if they've been an arsehole, it really ruins their work for you. I almost met Lou Reed once and I&#xa0;decided not to about five seconds before. He's got a bit of reputation and I would hate not to be able to listen&#xa0;to his records any more.</p> <p><strong>It's your birthday next&#xa0;week <em>(12)</em>: can we get&#xa0;you&#xa0;a&#xa0;gift&#xa0;? </strong></p> <p>Cash is always good.

  "<p>A crucial shift is now taking place in the Middle East towards the conflict in Syria. The Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi's call for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/27/egypt-president-iran-syria-violence\" title=\"\">Arab-Iranian-Turkish dialogue over the crisis</a> and a safe transfer of power in Syria \u2013 which he repeated in his speech to the Non-Aligned Movement summit in Tehran \u2013 has been well received in Turkey and Iran. All these countries have a powerful interest in making such a dialogue work, which makes the chances of success far greater than at any time previously.</p> <p>The context is clear enough. The Syrian rebels have made major gains. The revolution moved to a new phase after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/18/syrian-regime-figures-bomb-attack\" title=\"\">18 July attack in Damascus,</a> which took the lives of several top security officials, a huge morale boost to the Free Syrian Army (FSA). It has since tried to secure a number of Syrian border crossings with Turkey and Iraq, and its fighters also established a military presence in Damascus and Aleppo, two cities which had been under the absolute control of the regime.</p> <p>As for the regime, it has witnessed a collapse of morale, represented by a raft of major defections \u2013 the most important being that of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/06/syria-prime-minister-confirms-defection\" title=\"\">former prime minister</a> and a number of military and security leaders. This has created considerable alarm within the Bashar al-Assad regime, provoking savage responses, as demonstrated by the unprecedented use of air power to bomb population centres. The outcome has been a startling rise in casualties and an unprecedented flow of refugees to neighbouring countries. Assad's <a href=\"http://www.albawaba.com/news/assad-situation-improving-439917\" title=\"\">interview this week asking for more time to defeat the rebels</a> suggests the bloodshed will get even worse.</p> <p>Iran recognises now that it is just a matter of time before the Assad regime falls, and its realisation that unlimited support for him will be a disaster has led Tehran to search for an exit from this Syrian quagmire.</p> <p>Syria represented the cornerstone of the so-called \"axis of resistance\". The exit of Sunni Hamas from Damascus last year, following the regime's crackdown, was a huge blow to this axis, exposing a sectarian divide. Most regional parties who now support the Alawite regime in Damascus are Shia, from Tehran to the Maliki regime in Iraq and Hezbollah in Lebanon. This has alienated Iran from the Sunni majority in the region and worldwide, at a time when the US and Israel threaten a military strike against its nuclear facilities.</p> <p>Hence the Egyptian initiative gave Iran an important opportunity which it seized immediately. The participation of Morsi in the non-aligned alliance in Tehran offers an important diplomatic opportunity for Iran.</p> <p>This week's summit, also attended by UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, took place against the background of international failure to reach consensus on Syria given the positions taken by Russia and China on the one hand, and because of the hesitancy of the US to allow the flow of more effective anti-aircraft weapons to the FSA, fearing that these weapons may present a future danger to Israel's security. This position has clearly signalled to Syria's neighbours the need for an acceptable outcome to the bloody conflict before it risks engulfing the entire region.</p> <p>As for Turkey, it is beginning to realise&#xa0;that the Syrian crisis could harm its own national security, not least with the escalation of hostile Kurdish activities against Turkey in the Syrian border provinces. Not only that, but the collapse of the Assad regime would cause a huge security and economic burden if there were no agreement with Iran and the Arab states over a smooth transitional process. The common fear is that Syria could&#xa0;become the battleground for a regional proxy war, with various players&#xa0;seeking to secure their interests by supporting allied military groups in a&#xa0;conflict lasting years.</p> <p>The Arab states, particularly Saudi Arabia and Qatar who support the Free Syrian Army, also favour a regional agreement of which Iran will be a part. Despite growing fears over Iran, the Gulf&#xa0;states don't wish for a confrontation with Tehran because the costs of such a conflict would be huge. The reception given by Saudi Arabia to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the recent <a href=\"http://www.arabialink.com/2012/08/16/special-report-mecca-islamic-summit-final-communique/\" title=\"\">Islamic solidarity conference in Mecca</a>, and the announcement by King Abdullah of the establishment of a centre of dialogue between Islamic schools of thoughts in Riyadh, signals that the Gulf states have no desire to further strain relations with Iran.</p> <p>The Egyptian initiative is important because it is the first by its newly elected&#xa0;civilian president, and&#xa0;also because it comes after Morsi was able to establish his authority internally by dismissing the previous military leadership. This gives his initiative greater weight abroad and signals a return to Egypt playing its historic leading role.</p> <p>Egypt today appears well qualified to take a balanced position between all the parties: it does not carry any constraining baggage; and given that it represents the spirit of the Arab spring, it has moral authority. All this has pushed the regional parties to respond positively.</p> <p>We should also not ignore the position of the Syrian people, who will have the final word on their future. They \u2013 like Turkey, the Arab League and the Egyptian president \u2013 will not accept any solution that does not guarantee the departure of the Assad regime. However, Morsi made clear that he is against any military intervention in Syria, which resonates well in Tehran.</p> <p>And above all, it is imperative that Iran recognises this is the last opportunity to correct its strategic error of supporting a regime that is about to fall.</p>",
  "<p>The 270 miners arrested during violent strikes in South Africa have been charged with the murder of their 34 colleagues who were shot dead by police.</p> <p>The murder charge \u2013 and associated charges for the attempted murder of 78 miners injured at the Marikana mine near Johannesburg \u2013 was brought by the national prosecuting authority under an obscure Roman-Dutch common law previously used by the apartheid government.</p> <p>The move came as the men appeared in court charged with public violence over the clashes at the Lonmin platinum mine on 16 August when striking miners armed with clubs, machetes and at least one gun allegedly charged police, who opened fire. It suggests President Jacob Zuma's government is trying to shift the blame for the killings to the striking miners.</p> <p>The prosecuting authority said all 270 miners had been charged. Less than one in 10 Lonmin miners turned up for work at the mine on Tuesday, the lowest level since workers returned to work following the clashes.

  "<p>Just as lawyers prepare a New York civil suit against Dominique Strauss-Kahn over the alleged attempted rape of New York hotel worker, the arts world is trying to make sense of France's biggest political sex scandal in an array of films, plays and bestselling books.</p> <p>Neither the script nor title of a much-talked-about DSK feature film by Bad Lieutenant director Abel Ferrara has been finalised, but shooting is about to begin in New York, Washington and Paris, and the French media are poring over what it might entail. DSK, a one-time presidential hopeful and head of the International Monetary Fund, has been a political pariah in France since his arrest in New York last year over the alleged attempted rape of an immigrant hotel worker, Nafissatou Diallo.</p> <p>Charges were dropped over \"substantial credibility issues\" with the alleged victim, but Strauss-Kahn returned to France to face charges of \"aggravated pimping in an organised gang\" in a case in Lille in which sex workers were allegedly procured for orgies. The inquiry has been extended to examine alleged group rape over the question of whether one sex worker was forced. Strauss-Kahn's lawyers argue he did not know the women were paid. He denies any violence.</p> <p>Isabelle Adjani, who is to star as Strauss-Kahn's multimillionaire journalist wife, Anne Sinclair, in the Ferrara film, has been all over French media this week, promising the movie would not shirk the toughest elements of the tale.</p> <p>\"It will be the behind-closed-doors view of a couple swept up by torment,\" she told the Journal du Dimanche. \"It will be exciting because we've got a director who isn't French at the helm and he'll go where it hurts. With him, there's no risk of political correctness.\"</p> <p>She told Canal Plus she would not \"put on 10kg\" to look like Sinclair and Gerard Depardieu, who is to play DSK, would not dye his hair grey.</p> <p>Depardieu had told Swiss TV: \"I'm going to play Dominique Strauss-Kahn because I don't like him.\" He said the Socialist was \"arrogant\", \"unlikeable\" and therefore possible to play.</p> <p>From the Paris theatre scene to this month's Edinburgh fringe, plays have already focused on the DSK affair and his relationship with Sinclair, who has since separated from him. An investigation into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/07/dominique-strass-kahn-new-book?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">the couple's relationship and lifestyle</a> was one of the biggest non-fiction bestsellers in France this summer.</p> <p>A novel by the French author St\u00e9phane Zagdanski, called <em>Chaos Br\u00fblant </em>(Burning Chaos), retells the New York case through the eyes of patients in a Manhattan psychiatric centre. Linda Fairstein, a former chief of the sex crimes unit in Manhattan, made the New York Times bestseller list with a thriller, Night Watch, inspired by the case, after the US TV series Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit ran its own DSK-inspired episode.</p> <p>Tristane Banon, in whose case prosecutors found prima facie evidence of her having experienced a sexual assault by Strauss-Kahn, although the alleged attack had passed the time limit, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/13/dominique-strauss-kahn-tristane-banon\" title=\"\">published a \"novelisation\"</a> of a sex attack by a veteran politician she called the baboon.</p> <p>A similar range of stage and screen takes came after the 1990s corruption scandal at the French oil giant Elf, inlcuding Claude Chabrol's dark thriller, A Comedy of Power, in which Isabelle Huppert played a vengeful magistrate loosely modelled on the prosecutor Eva Joly.</p>",

In <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Where-Did-Our-Love-Go/dp/0711995117\" title=\"\">Where Did Our Love Go?</a>, a history of Motown, Nelson George noted the jealousy among staffers towards the <a href=\"http://www.steviewonder.org.uk/discography/albums/12year_old_genius/12year_old_genius.html\" title=\"\">12-year-old-genius</a>, even if detractors were soon silenced by his fabulous run of mainly self-penned hits: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14hskyBXkPo\" title=\"\">Uptight (Everything's Alright)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vxVyaYuGYE\" title=\"\">For Once In My Life</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnykC_Hjd7Y\" title=\"\">My Cherie Amour</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS2nfeN4DEw\" title=\"\">Signed, Sealed, Delivered</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395439184\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346348389740/Wonder-in-the-early-60s.-010.jpg\" alt=\"Wonder in the early 60s.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wonder in the early 60s. Photograph: David Redfern</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Redfern</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1971, he released the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/jun/11/marvin-gaye-whats-going-on\" title=\"\">transitional Where I'm Coming From</a>, which along with Marvin Gaye's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzPA-FrVu3I\" title=\"\">What's Going On</a> was the first serious album from a label accustomed to singles. It was a brave departure from the Motown sound, with forays into psychedelia, baroque pop and folk-inflected soul.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"I had fun doing that album with [ex-wife] Syreeta,\" he says. \"Berry [Gordy, Motown boss] said: 'Do your thing.'\"</p> <p>He recalls writing the song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIFVh_5cfmw\" title=\"\">If You Really Love Me</a> at the apartment of Laura Nyro, no stranger herself to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2005/apr/02/popandrock\" title=\"\">startling chord sequence</a>. Fellow Motown songwriter Smokey Robinson, however, was unimpressed with his new direction after he saw Wonder on comedian <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMmkYoiVkhE\" title=\"\">Flip Wilson's TV show</a>.</p> <p>\"I got a call from Smokey and he says: 'I didn't like your choice of material. I think it's really ridiculous.' I said: 'I don't give a \"uh\" what you think, or what anyone thinks!' That was my growing-up moment at Motown.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>Hooking up with Malcolm Cecil and Robert Margouleff of electronic duo <a href=\"http://www.tontosexpandingheadband.com\" title=\"\">Tonto's Expanding Headband</a>, Wonder pursued a radical synthesised context for his new soul vision. His purple streak continued with 1972's Music of My Mind and Talking Book, 1973's Innervisions, 1974's Fulfillingness' First Finale, culminating in 1976's double-LP (plus additional EP) treasure trove Songs In The Key Of Life. With their dazzling melodies and blend of gritty politicised funk and elegant ballads, these albums appealed to rock and soul fans alike.&#xa0;</p> <p>He overreached himself on 1979's Journey Through The Secret Life Of Plants, a double concept album full of new age noodling, but he redeemed himself, critically and commercially, with 1980's Hotter Than July. And if his recordings since have been patchily received, there is consensus among music lovers that his golden age lasted longer than anyone's, Bob Dylan and the Beatles included. &#xa0;</p> <p>Wonder is adamant that his heyday of exploratory music-making is not over, despite the fact that his last album, A Time to Love,only his fourth LP proper in three decades, was issued in 2005. \"I'm still experimenting,\" he enthuses. \"There's a new instrument I'm learning to play called the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV2AtWPmOtM\" title=\"\">harpejji</a>. It's between a piano and a guitar. I'm writing really different songs with it \u2013 I have so many. The question is, will they outlive me? Time is long but life is short.\"</p> <p>Does Wonder, who has just turned 62, have a growing sense of his mortality? \"I don't feel it,\" he says of time's marching. \"I know it for a fact.\"</p> <p>He feels a pressing need to achieve in non-musical spheres, and digresses to discuss gun crime, a subject on which he has been outspoken. \"I'm concerned about how accessible guns are,\" he says. Is he referring to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/20/batman-shooting-killed-colorado-cinema\" title=\"\">\"Batman shootings\"</a> in Colorado?&#xa0;</p> <p>\"No, I'm talking about in the hood,\" he replies. \"That [Colorado] was also very sad, but this is an occurrence almost every week in various cities. But no politician wants to confront it. The right to bear arms? What about the right to live?\"&#xa0;</p> <p>Does he fear what happened to John Lennon could happen to him?</p> <p>\"I've had threats,\" he says, \"but I don't put that energy out there because that's just craziness.\"</p> <p>Can he feel the same connection to \"the street\" that he did in the 70s when he penned sociopolitical anthems such as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSRyf5G2uI8\" title=\"\">Living For The City</a>?</p> <p>\"Of course,\" he exclaims. \"I travel and do stuff.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>What's it like when he and his entourage sweep through town?</p> <p>\"I just focus on what I'm doing,\" he says. \"If fans take pictures ... Every time I think about getting annoyed I remember how blessed I've been to have people who have followed my career.\"</p> <p>Is he in touch with the young man who wrote, say, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDZFf0pm0SE\" title=\"\">Superstition</a>?&#xa0;</p> <p>\"Oh yeah,\" he replies, breezily. \"I listen to him. And I make sure I feel the same way still.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395439185\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346348578435/Performing-for-Democratic-010.jpg\" alt=\"Performing for Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama, 2007.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Performing for Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama, 2007.

These days, he <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxGPrea0fLM\" title=\"\">supports the president</a>. What is his view of rappers such as Jay-Z, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/23/why-hip-hop-deserting-obama?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">said to be turning against \"B-Rock\"</a>?&#xa0;</p> <p>\"Well,\" he sighs, striking a rare note of antipathy, \"those who have turned against him, it's because they're ignorant or it doesn't serve their own interest, which probably has to do with money. But the reality is, your money is only as good as you're able to help others with it.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>Even before his accident, when his music was at its most supersonically joyous, Wonder spoke in dread tones of an apocalyptic future, and of the ominous present presaging it. \"It's the last days of life, of beauty,\" he declared, referring darkly to \"all the horrors and hypocrisy in the world\".</p> <p>After the crash he became increasingly affirmative. But how do these times compare? Is he more optimistic now?</p> <p>\"I'm always optimistic, but the world isn't. People need to make a jump to a place of positivity but they put it all on one person to make it happen,\" he says. \"It takes everybody. And the mindset has to be different. I mean, how do we have, in 2012, racism in the world?\"</p> <p>Did he assume that racism would be obliterated?</p> <p>\"It can't be obliterated until people confront the demon in the spirit,\" he says. No wonder one of his current roles is as a Messenger of Peace for the United Nations.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"You need to put your heart into making a difference,\" he says, proposing \"an end to poverty, starvation, racism and illiteracy and finding cures for cancer and Aids\" as just some of the jobs that need doing.&#xa0;</p> <p>Doesn't he wish he could subvert his beatific image? Has the Messenger of Peace ever wanted to punch someone?</p> <p>\"No,\" he says patiently, as though to a child who has said something particularly dumb. \"When you punch somebody it means you have let your ability to communicate out the gate.\"</p> <p>Wonder mentions \"the demon in the spirit\". How has he managed to endure when his revolutionary soul peers \u2013 Marvin, Sly Stone, James Brown \u2013 succumbed to torment and temptation?&#xa0;</p> <p>\"First of all,\" he stresses, \"I'm no better than the next person. But I've never had a desire to do drugs. When I was 21 I smoked marijuana, and I didn't like the way it made me feel. When I woke up the next morning I felt like I'd lost part of my brain.\"</p> <p>Wonder has also seen the passing of younger talents: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/michaeljackson\" title=\"\">Michael Jackson</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/whitney-houston\" title=\"\">Whitney Houston</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/amywinehouse\" title=\"\">Amy Winehouse</a> ...</p> <p>\"It's been a heartbreak,\" he says. \"Obviously I knew Michael.\" In 2009 he broke down during a performance of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzyJGHjREk0\" title=\"\">Jackson's The Way You Make Me Feel</a>. \"I knew Whitney, too, and I understand Amy came to my concert in England a couple of years ago.

It would have been amazing.\"</p> <p>Had he met Winehouse, would he have offered her words of wisdom, or would there have been no point?&#xa0;</p> <p>\"There's always a point,\" he says.&#xa0;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395439186\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346348232843/Recording-We-Are-The-Worl-010.jpg\" alt=\"Recording We Are The World with Lionel Richie, Daryl Hall, Quincy Jones and Paul Simon, 1985.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Recording We Are The World with Lionel Richie, Daryl Hall, Quincy Jones and Paul Simon, 1985.

I am what I am. I love me! And I don't mean that egotistically \u2013 I love that God has allowed me to take whatever it was that I had and to make something out of it.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>Does he never allow himself an egotistical moment to survey his career?</p> <p>\"Nah,\" he says, \"that's a waste of time. I enjoy listening to the stuff I've done, but that's it.\"</p> <p>Is he a genius?</p> <p>\"No,\" he says, \"I was just blessed to have ideas. The genius in me is God \u2013 it's the God in me coming out.\"</p> <p>This summer, he met the Queen after performing at the jubilee concert in London.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"She was born under the same astrological sign as me: Taurus,\" he marvels. \"It was wonderful meeting her.\"</p> <p>When I suggest that, if anyone should have been bowing and scraping, it was the one who, by accident of birth, acquired enormous status and wealth, not the one who, by sheer hard graft, changed the course of popular culture, he disagrees.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"That's because you don't believe in the power and the spirit that is intangible but is all around us,\" he mildly scolds. \"There has to be a higher energy power.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, Wonder is aware of his impact, and of those who have picked up his progressive soul baton, such as Ocean. Was he surprised that there could, in 2012, be a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jul/04/frank-ocean-courage-come-out\" title=\"\">furore at the revelation that a rapper might be gay</a>?</p> <p>\"I think honestly, some people who think they're gay, they're confused,\" he says. \"People can misconstrue closeness for love. People can feel connected, they bond. I'm not saying all [gay people are confused]. Some people have a desire to be with the same sex. But that's them.\"</p> <p>In 1974, US rock critic Robert Christgau described Wonder as \"a sainted fool\". He wrote: \"I'm not saying he's a complete fool; in fact, I'm not saying he isn't a genius. But you can't deny that if you were to turn on a phone-in station and hear Stevie rapping about divine vibrations and universal brotherhood ... you would not be impressed with his intellectual discernment.\" Certainly, with Wonder, you have to suspend your cynicism. But he has to contend with being narrowcast still.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"I've never said I was a soul artist or an R&amp;B artist,\" he responds when I venture that the music he made in the 70s was a soul version of progressive rock. \"They're just labels. When you're soul it means black, when you're pop it means white. That's bullshit. If it's good, it's good. It's like that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBeBQJHhIj4\" title=\"\">old Jerry Reed song</a>: 'When you're hot, you're hot, when you're not, you're not.'\"</p>",

  "<p>Tropical storm Isaac ploughed inland on Thursday, causing fresh flooding and power outages in Louisiana and Mississippi and prompting emergency evacuations and warnings, even as New Orleans began its post-hurricane clear-up.</p> <p>Authorities sent convoys of military Humvees, buses and specialised high-water vehicles around the shores of Lake Ponchartrain, north of New Orleans, to rescue stranded people and evacuate others deemed at risk.</p> <p>They ordered residents to leave low-lying, rural areas along the Tangipahoa river amid concern the 700-acre dam at Percy Quin state park may fail and add to the already swollen river.</p> <p>Flood waters rose waist-high in some areas, trapping people in cars and homes, and three tornadoes were reported overnight in Mississippi and Alabama, prompting warnings to Arkansas and Missouri to brace for Isaac on Friday even though it was now downgraded to a tropical depression.</p> <p>Rains around New Orleans eased enough to allow helicopter operations, including the rescue of a couple and their dogs from a flooded house.</p> <p>Pets have been a leitmotif of the emergency, with many people ignoring evacuation orders because they had nowhere to bring pets, or wading through waters with nothing but pets in their arms.</p> <p>President Barack Obama declared federal emergencies in Louisiana and Mississippi late on Wednesday, freeing federal aid for affected areas.</p> <p>The nightmare scenario \u2013 a devastating hit on New Orleans on the anniversary of hurricane Katrina \u2013 failed to materialise. Isaac skirted the city on Wednesday as a category 1 hurricane, dumping more than a feet of water in places and turning streets into wind tunnels, but no serious flooding was reported.</p> <p>Officials said the $14.5bn bolstering of the city's flood control system worked as it should, averting a repeat of the 2005 catastrophe when levees failed and 1,800 people died.</p> <p>There was at least one technical glitch: the US army corps of engineers could not start drainage pumps for the 17th St Canal remotely overnight, causing a delay as they had to be operated manually.</p> <p>It was not a significant problem as the canal was not full, said Sandy Rosenthal of levees.org, an advocacy group, but could potentially have been a \"major disaster\" had the storm been more powerful. Overall, she said, he preparation and response was \"100 times better\" than seven years ago. \"We felt much safer.\"</p> <p>Even so, the 70mph winds knocked out power to 730,000 homes in Louisiana and Mississippi. Police, state troopers and national guard units enforced a dawn to dusk curfew to deter looters and keep people off streets littered with debris and broken power lines.</p> <p>\"If you loot, you'll wear an orange suit,\" the mayor, Mitch Landrieu, told a news conference.</p> <p>Sixteen looting-related arrests were reported by Thursday. He tweeted an appeal for caution amid signs of returning normality. \"I would ask everyone to work really really hard to be patient &amp; to assist public officials by staying out of their way.\" Homeowners began to take down boards from windows and some stores opened.</p> <p>Just 20 miles south however in Plaquemines parish, a sparsely-populated rural area, there were still dramatic scenes of surging waters and rescues. The town of Braithwaite was drowned, with tops of buildings peeking from the water. Uniformed officials were checking homes for signs of people left behind. About 800 homes in the parish were damaged, said Bobby Jindal, Louisiana's governor.</p> <p>Officials considered intentionally breaching a levee this weekend to let some floodwater flow back out of the inundated area, he added.</p> <p>Major flooding was also reported in the town of Slidell, north-east of New Orleans. There were two reported casualties in and around New Orleans \u2013 a tow-truck driver felled by a tree, and another man who fell from a tree. Several highways and airports remained closed on Thursday.</p>",
  "<p>The Paralympic repair workshop, in the heart of the athletes' village, is a fantastically noisy place. The screech of high-speed circular saws slicing into wheelchair frames is punctuated with the clatter of hammers and merges with the serious mumble of technicians gathered around prosthetic limbs.</p> <p>On the first day of competition the Paralympic pitstop \u2013 the workroom where up to 4,200 athletes, each with different and complicated technical needs, will come for emergency repairs throughout the Games \u2013 is already rammed.</p> <p>Athletes in colourful team tracksuits grasp for technical vocabulary in the bustling triage area, while technicians listen intently and take detailed notes. A swinging door leads to the backroom workshop where the team is hard at work. It is a somewhat surreal scene: one technician carries a leg \u2013 wearing a brand new trainer \u2013 across the room, while another squeezes glue into a plastic hollowed-out foot resting on a workbench. In a corner his colleague concentrates intensely on shaping a new leg support over an upturned mould.</p> <p>\"We get everything in here from hi-tech running blades to basic wheelchairs that come in in pieces,\" explains technical director Ken Hurst, raising his soft geordie voice to be heard over the constant clatter of repairs. \"It can get quite crazy, but it's a buzz and it drives us. When athletes need repairs, they need them quickly so the pressure is really on.\"</p> <p>The 6,500 sq ft workshop, somewhere between a laboratory, garage and community centre, has 80 technicians from 18 countries \u2013 including prosthetists, orthotists, wheelchair technicians, and 12 welders. As well as the work that goes on in the workshop they provide a pitstop service at every field of play to tackle emergency repairs.</p> <p>For a Paralympian, it is one of the most important places in the park, says German sprinter Heinrich Popow, a single leg amputee competing in the T42 long jump and 100m. Waiting for small, but vital adjustments to his leg socket after losing weight on his stump since coming to the village, he looks on as new strips of padded felt were measured and slotted into his racing socket.</p> <p>\"My socket has become loose and even though I could run I wouldn't have a free mind \u2013 I'd be thinking about my socket,\" he says. \"We are ready to compete but if something happens outside your control you can lose four years. In all other aspects you can help yourself, but if your prosthetic is broken you need technical help you can't do it. It helps me sleep at night knowing they are here.\"</p> <p>Since the Ottobock workshop opened its doors on 22 August it has been inundated, making more than 845 repairs before the Games were declared open and fitting 63 wheelchairs with flagpole holders for the Opening Ceremony.</p> <p>Each day provides a different story and challenge, according to organising director Peter Franzel. Wheelchair rugby players \u2013 whose fierce contact sport is sometimes referred to as murderball \u2014 are among the most regular visitors, but athletes from every sport, from boccia players to sprinters, can pass through these doors needing help.</p> <p>One Egyptian powerlifter came into the workshop on a barely functioning, ancient wheelchair. Technicians decided it was too damaged to repair, and instead gave the woman a new chair. \"Of course, we wouldn't do that for an athlete from the USA or Europe, but she was very touched,\" said Franzel. \"It was like we had given her a new Mercedes.\"</p> <p>The firm has been providing technical support for the Paralympics since 1988 as part of their sponsorship deal, meaning that the repair work is free for athletes. This is even more important to those who have come from developing nations where top-of-the-range equipment remains prohibitively expensive and rare.</p> <p>In the waiting room one Moroccan female powerlifter appears to be asking for a complete MOT of her rudimentary leather and steel leg support, while the president of the Nigerian Paralympic Committee, Monday Emoghavwe, explains that vital repairs for his athletes happen once every four years. \"At home we just improvise, you have to become your own mechanic,\" he said. \"But the problem is we often don't get it right. My own chair was last fixed in Beijing and before we compete the whole team will come here.\"</p> <p>But the technicians in this workshop are not just highly skilled repairmen \u2013 they listen patiently to athletes' demands, providing advice and solving problems with a calm swiftness that belies the manic atmosphere.</p> <p>\"We know that it is so psychologically important for the athletes that they feel everything is right. We all have a passion for that in here,\" says Hurst, who got his calling to become a prosthetist after watching a feature about mechanical limbs on the science television show Tomorrow's World. \"It was the spark of a real passion in me. There can be heartache sometimes but are also fantastic successes, I just think I am very lucky to have this job.\"</p> <p>Popow, who has worked closely with his own prosthetist for much of his athletic career, explains that he is not only a engineer, but a friend, mentor and some time psychiatrist. \"My relationship with my technician is like my relationship with my parents,\" says the 29-year-old. \"He is making my body, so he really has to know and understand me.\"</p> <p>He gives a neat example: during the Bejing Paralympics the athlete visited his prosthetist, who was working in the athletes' village, complaining that his socket was faulty. The technician took the leg away, returning it slightly later. But it was only after Popow had won a silver medal in the T42 100m that he told the athlete he had done nothing other than warm the socket. \"He recognised that I was just nervous. The problem was not with the socket but with me,\" explains Popow. \"A perfect technician has to do great work but also be a great psychiatrist.\"</p>",
  "<p>The French government is under growing pressure to contain Marseille's deadly drug wars after the 19th gun-related death in the region this year.</p> <p>The latest casualty prompted a Socialist senator to call for the army to be sent in to control estates in the city.</p> <p>As Marseille prepares to become European capital of culture next year, the growing problem of drug dealers setting scores with AK-47s has blighted its public relations drive. On Wednesday, a 25-year-old known to police over drug-trafficking, was hit with Kalashnikov-fire as he travelled in the passenger seat of a Renault Twingo in the north of the city. It was the 14th gun-related death connected to drug gangs in Marseille since the start of this year, the 19th in the region. A few weeks earlier another 25-year-old who had recently been released from prison died in hospital after he was shot in the south of the city. This year's Marseille gang deaths already exceed the figures for the whole of 2011.</p> <p>The Socialist senator and mayor of two Marseille districts, Samia Ghali, warned: \"It's now useless sending a coach of riot police to stop the dealers. When one is stopped, 10 more take up the flame. It's like fighting an ants' nest.\" She said faced with the heavy weapons used by the gangs, \"only the army can intervene\".</p> <p>Her comments embarrassed the Socialist government, which is already under pressure over how to handle security on France's most restive estates. Manuel Valls, the interior minister, dismissed Ghali's comments: \"Its out of the question for the army to respond to these dramas and crimes.\" He said there was no \"enemy within\" against whom the French army would go to war on its own territory.</p> <p>The president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said: \"The army has no place controlling neighbourhoods in the republic.\" He said it was up to the police to deal with the problem and promised reinforcements.</p>",
  "<p>An Israeli attack on Iran would delay but probably not stop its nuclear programme, the most senior US military officer has claimed. General Martin Dempsey reinforced Washington's opposition to unilateral Israel military action as he made clear that US military chiefs were equally wary of getting ensnared in Syria.</p> <p>In common with Nato's supreme commander, US admiral James Stavridis, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/30/we-will-win-in-afghanistan\" title=\"\">wrote about Afghanistan for the Guardian on Thursday</a>, Dempsey put a brave face on the situation there. The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff was speaking to journalists in London, where he attended the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games as head of the US delegation.</p> <p>Distancing himself from any Israeli plan to bomb Iran, Dempsey said such an attack would \"clearly delay but probably not destroy Iran's nuclear programme\".</p> <p>He added: \"I don't want to be complicit if they [Israel] choose to do it.\"</p> <p>Dempsey said he did not know Iran's nuclear intentions, as intelligence did not reveal intentions. What was clear, he said, was that the \"international coalition\" applying pressure on Iran \"could be undone if [Iran] was attacked prematurely\". Sanctions against Iran were having an effect, and they should be given a reasonable opportunity to succeed.</p> <p>On Syria, he said, Washington was collaborating with the country's neighbours, sharing intelligence and helping with military planning. The US was supplying humanitarian aid to Turkey.</p> <p>But Dempsey warned of the implications of establishing a \"humanitarian zone\" inside Syria, as suggested by others, including France, have suggested. Syria was not Libya, he said, there was no comparison.</p> <p>Those who established a humanitarian zone would be obliged to assume responsibility for protecting it, Dempsey said. That would mean not merely establishing a no-fly zone but providing protection against Syrian missiles.</p> <p>The US, like the UK, was supplying \"non-lethal\" aid to Syrian rebels. What he described as \"any broader activities inside Syria\" would have to be discussed and conducted within the Nato framework, Dempsey said. The worst-case scenario would be Syria ending up as a failed state, he said. He was reflecting growing concern in the west and elsewhere, including Russia, about the crisis allowing armed extreme jihadists and al-Qaida sympathisers with the opportunity to increase their influence and expand control across Syria.</p> <p>In Afghanistan, the Taliban were using young men in \"green on blue\" attacks \u2013 attacks by Afghans in army uniform \u2013 as part of a new asymmetric weapon, as improvised explosive devices had been in the past, Dempsey suggested.</p> <p>A rapid expansion of Afghan security forces from some about 200,000 to more than 300,000 in two years had \"exposed vulnerabilities in vetting practices\", he said.</p> <p>Nato had to help develop Afghan forces to ensure Nato troops ended their combat role by the target date of the end of 2014, \"and we will\", Dempsey said.</p> <p>Stavridis wrote that \"measurable and substantial progress\" has been made in Afghanistan in three specific areas. Firstly, Afghanistan is no longer a safe haven for terrorists, he said. Secondly, Afghan national forces have improved markedly over the past 18 months, \"to the point where they are making significant gains in the fight against the Taliban\". As a result, \"this has been a particularly difficult summer for the insurgency, which has seen the elimination of two top-level commanders in the past few days alone\".</p> <p>Thirdly, the international community has made specific pledges on long-term partnerships with Afghanistan.</p> <p>Stavridis said Afghan society was changing for the better every day, but acknowledged that the Nato-led coalition faced formidable challenges over the next few years. \"I have no doubt that there will still be difficult days ahead.\"</p>",
  "<p>The play by Arthur Miller that became Death of a Salesman was originally called The Inside of His Head, but the title could apply equally to <a href=\"http://www.vanishing-point.org/\" title=\"\">Vanishing Point</a>'s nightmarish contribution to the&nbsp;final week of the Edinburgh international festival. The head in question belongs to a \"normal and healthy\" middle-class father, played by&nbsp;Paul Thomas Hickey, whose exterior reality \u2013 cosy nights in watching The X Factor \u2013 contrasts with his predilection for sadistic chatroom porn.</p> <p>Towering over his sleeping wife is a huge projection of Tania, 24, a Brazilian model played by a hardbitten Fl\u00e1via Gusm\u00e3o, who is willing to indulge some, if not all, of his sexual fantasies. Her looming presence in the living room is a visual metaphor for the internet's intrusion into his life. The further he goes, room by room, into this virtual wonderland, the greater the schism between the inside and outside of&nbsp;his head.</p> <p>His 18-year-old daughter, meanwhile, is playing little-girl-lost as she makes her own forays into online sex, changing her name from Alice to Heidi and stepping through the looking glass to star in what look increasingly like snuff movies. Played by Jenny Hulse, she is not the victim she seems, but neither is she fully in control.</p> <p>Matthew Lenton's production excels in its impressionistic visions of people caught in a pornographic arms race as they seek ever greater levels of degradation, but at the cost of making the audience wallow in the same miserable material.</p> <p>Rather like the depressingly nihilist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/06/morning-edinburgh-review\" title=\"\">Morning</a> by Simon Stephens, part of the&nbsp;Traverse's fringe season, Wonderland offers no psychological insight and no possibility of redemption.

  "<p>Ministers and universities have joined forces to help legitimate students affected by London Metropolitan University being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/30/london-metropolitan-university-international-students\" title=\"\">stripped of its powers to teach and recruit students from outside the European Union</a>.</p> <p>London Met's vice-chancellor said the action threatened the UK university \"brand\", but the <a href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/newsarticles/2012/august/28-LMU-revoked1\" title=\"\">UK Border Agency</a> insisted that problems over the enforcement of visa rules lay with one university, not the whole sector.</p> <p>The government and university chiefs have begun trying to help up to 2,700 students from abroad affected by the UKBA ruling which means London Met is no longer able to teach even its current international students. It is the first UK university to be stripped of this licence.</p> <p>Those affected need to find alternative courses elsewhere and get new visas within 60 days of receiving \"curtailment letters\", or leave Britain voluntarily. Otherwise they will be removed from the country.</p> <p>The Home Office clarified that the 60-day deadline would only begin once the letters had been delivered to individual students. The Guardian understands it could be weeks before the notices, which are a legal necessity, are sent out in order to give genuine students more time to relocate.</p> <p>The government has also set up a taskforce consisting of the UKBA, the Department of Business, Universities UK, the higher education funding body HEFCE, and the National Union of Students to deal with the situation. It is expected to have its first meeting on Friday to attempt to go through every London Met international student file to identify legitimate cases and help them enrol at other universities.</p> <p>About 290,000 students and dependent visas are issued by the UKBA each year, and 110,000 extensions to such visas.</p> <p>Malcolm Gillies, London Met's head, said the loss of its ability to authorise visas \"sends a fear through many universities in a way that I think is going to be detrimental to their confidence as higher education institutions, but also the projection of brand UK abroad.\"</p> <p>He said responses from other universities included \"commiseration, worry, anger, but also a feeling of probably, 'well thank God it wasn't us this time'. I think that shows the nervousness that many in the sector have, especially at a time when clearly government policy is changing but also when the [UKBA] guidelines have been changing very rapidly.\"</p> <p>Gillies has warned that the future of the university, which has 30,000 students, is at risk because the punishment for its immigration failures will leave a \u00a330m hole in its annual budget, a fifth of the total. The UK's lucrative higher education business in teaching international students involves about 300,000 students and is worth an estimated \u00a35bn a year to the economy.</p> <p>About 500 private higher education colleges have already lost their power to recruit abroad following crackdowns on bogus students.</p> <p>The immigration minister Damian Green said London Met had displayed a \"serious systemic failure\" to know whether its students had the right to be in the UK. He denied making the university a political football over immigration controls and insisted such action would not be replicated across the university sector.</p> <p>Green said people entering Britain as students but seeking work exploited one of the biggest loopholes in the immigration system.</p> <p>UKBA audits of London Met found that more than a quarter of cases sampled had no leave to remain in Britain. There was also no proof that a significant proportion of international students had satisfactory English. In more than half of the cases the university did not know whether students were attending lectures.</p> <p>Green said \"any of these three breaches would be serious\" and that it was important to ensure \"not just private colleges but universities obey the law\".</p> <p>\"What we found here is a serious systemic failure where it appears that the university doesn't have the capacity to be a proper sponsor [of international students] and to have confidence that the students have the right to be here in the first place,\" Green said.</p> <p>University funders and leaders said the first priority was to sort out the future of genuine students. It is understood the HEFCE and London Met have been in talks for weeks over the crisis, which began when the UKBA suspended the university's right to be a \"highly trusted sponsor\" of students on 16 July.</p> <p>Professor Eric Thomas, the president of Universities UK, said the organisation was committed to eliminating any abuse of the student visa system, but there were alternative ways to address UKBA's concerns and revocation of a university's licence should only be a last resort.</p> <p>\"We will be working with UKBA to ensure that compliance issues can be addressed in a more constructive way in the future,\" Thomas said.</p> <p>Syed Rumman, vice-president for education for London Met's student union, accused the government of \"chucking students' lives into the bin\".</p> <p>Liam Burns, president of the NUS, said: \"It is disgusting that international students continue to be used as a political football by politicians who seem either incapable of understanding, or are simply uncaring about the impact of their decisions on individuals, universities and the UK economy.</p> <p>\"This decision will create panic and potential heartbreak for students not just at London Met but also all around the country.\"</p> <p>The UKBA said it been working with London Met to put right shortcomings since March, the same month the <a href=\"http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/1012/points_based_immigration.aspx\" title=\"\">National Audit Office</a> issued withering criticism of the agency's performance for taking \"little action\" in enforcing immigration rules for students. It said that in the first year after introducing the current system that licenses schools, colleges and universities to sponsor students in 2009, up to 50,000 students were thought to have entered Britain to work rather than study.</p> <p>Between February 2010 and October 2011 sponsoring institutions made 62,000 notifications to the agency that students were not attending college. The agency did not know how many students had left after their leave to remain had expired, although 2,700 students and overstayers had been removed from 1 April 2009.</p> <p>MPs on the <a href=\"http://Public Accounts Committee - UK Parliament\" title=\"\">Commons public accounts committee</a> will be reporting on the same issue on Tuesday, although the London Met crisis came too late for them to include it in their verdict on whether matters have improved in recent months.</p> <p>London Met has set up a helpline for worried students \u2013 +44 (0)20 7133 4141 \u2013 and the UKBA <a href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/newsfragments/72-LMU-student-page\">has posted advice for students online</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The easy bit for Antony Jenkins, Barclays' new chief executive, was today's meet-and-greet exercise. He did well, starting with the dutiful confession that the bank has made \"serious mistakes in recent years and clearly failed to keep pace with stakeholders' expectations\". That was stating the bleedin' obvious but needed to be said, especially by an internal appointment.</p> <p>But lest he scare too many traders in the investment bank, whose services are required until the moment they are not, he didn't overdo the transformational rhetoric. The bank's culture has to be \"modified\", said Jenkins, which made it sound like a matter of tweaking a few dials when surely he knows it's the work of half a decade at least. And what does Barclays want to be? A \"go to\" bank, apparently, which could mean anything or nothing.</p> <p>Where Jenkins did stick out his neck it was on a non-controversial point. Investors never trusted predecessor Bob Diamond's pledge that he could raise Barclays' returns on equity to 13%. The target was too hard and shareholders suspected victory would be declared after a single bull's-eye in a boom year. Jenkins' aim for \"sustainable\" returns above the bank's cost of capital is more sensible.</p> <p>Vague words of good intent are, of course, all one could expect on day one. Jenkins' first test comes when the business units have been reviewed and decisions made on where to allocate capital. How will his appointment be received in the investment bank, which makes half the group's profits but is an enormous consumer of capital and thus faces some degree of slimming?</p> <p>It's impossible to know at this stage. BarCap, as it used to be called, has been run as a fiefdom within Barclays since Diamond's early years \u2013 that was the John Varley formula. That arm's-length arrangement clearly has to end, but how will the highly paid employees react to being told what to do by a mere retail banker, albeit a successful one from the other side of Barclays? Will Rich Ricci, a Diamond lieutenant who is running the investment bank, stay to help?</p> <p>We shall see. It's not a good moment for aggrieved investment bankers to seek alternative employment, but there's clearly a risk that the slimming exercise at BarCap becomes chaotic. Jenkins' challenge is to get control of the process and keep control. Six months' time, when his cards are on the table, is the earliest point when the success of this appointment can start to be judged. Jenkins seems to have a clear sense of how Barclays needs to change, which is a big plus. The hard part is making it happen.</p>",
  "<p>I was delighted to read Lisa Hammond's open letter to writers as part of this year's TV Drama Writers' Festival \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/writersroom/posts/An-open-letter-to-writers-Put-Crips-in-your-scripts\" title=\"\">Put crips in your scripts</a>. It's a sentiment I support, and have for some time. As a playwright, I've been trying to put complex, seductive, intelligent characters who just so happen to have an impairment into my scripts for decades. It is only in rare cases I am commissioned to write such a play; usually I have to smuggle it in like a Trojan horse, with disability politics and what I call \"crip humour\" in its belly.</p> <p>Disability is often viewed as worthy, depressing, or a plethora of other negative associations I (and many others) have been trying to challenge and subvert in our work for years. I find this representation astonishing, for the vast majority of my disabled friends and colleagues are the wittiest, most outrageous and life-affirming human beings I have ever had the pleasure of spending time with.</p> <p>I identify proudly as a disabled person, but am often struck how to those without this cultural identification the impaired body is \"other\". Disabled people are \"them\" \u2013 over there \u2013 not a deaf uncle, a parent with Alzheimer's or an acquaintance who has survived brain injury following a car accident. Although the vast majority of us will acquire impairment through the natural process of ageing, through accident, warfare or illness, disabled people are still feared, ostracised and set apart.</p> <p>The western theatrical canon is filled with disabled characters. We are metaphors for tragedy, loss, the human condition \u2013 the victim or villain, the scapegoat, the inferior, scary \"special\" one, the freak, the problem requiring treatment, medicalisation and normalisation. Although disabled characters occur in thousands of plays, seldom have the writers been disabled themselves, or written from that perspective. It is also rare for actors with impairments to be cast in productions, even when the character is disabled. As I scornfully stated in my 2002 play Peeling, in which Hammond performed: \"Cripping up is the 21st century's answer to blacking up\".</p> <p>As Hammond suggests in her essay, the theatre profession just needs to get over it \u2013 their fear, concerns about expense, about difference. There are fantastic deaf and disabled performers in the UK, just as there are talented and experienced choreographers, directors, visual artists, sit-down comedians, and writers. I hope that the Paralympics, and <a href=\"http://unlimited.southbankcentre.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Unlimited at Southbank Centre</a>, part of the Cultural Olympiad, will change preconceptions just as the Olympics did regarding sportswomen and abilities.</p> <p>For \"putting crips in our scripts\" means we have different protagonists with different stories, which don't always have to revolve around yet another medical drama. The active, sexy, wilful protagonists of <a href=\"http://festival.london2012.com/events/9000961437\" title=\"\">my latest script</a> are an anomaly simply <em>by being protagonists</em>, and in control of their lives. The work is a montage of movement, visuals, excerpts from fictional monologues and not, as most of the reviewers assumed, the actors' autobiographies (as director John McGrath said, \"that's called acting\").</p> <p>We need characters who are not victims, whose diagnosis or difference is not the central drama of their lives, but multi-faceted individuals with careers and relationships, dreams and challenges. I want characters who are full of themselves, their hands and mouths filled with a swanky eloquence. Whether in signed or spoken languages, words can dazzle and dip, shape form, shape meaning and shape a perspective that counters the previously held.</p> <p>We need to have crips in our scripts not just to reflect the society we live in, but, as one of my characters says, to \"threaten the narrow definition of human variety \u2026 [to] broaden the scope of human possibilities\". And we need crip actors to perform these parts, not yet another non-disabled actor doing an impersonation, with an eye on an award.</p>",
  "<p>Forecasters have confirmed what many suspected: summer 2012 in England and Wales has been the biggest washout for a century. The Met Office said it had been the one of the dullest on record, one of the coolest, and the soggiest since 1912.</p> <p>As if to illustrate the point, Cumbria was hit by heavy rain and flash flooding on Thursday, , forcing people to leave their homes and causing a train carrying about 100 passengers to derail.</p> <p>A landslide is thought to have caused the derailment of the two-carriage train, which was travelling towards Sellafield nuclear plant. No injuries were reported.</p> <p>While the month is not quite over, Met Office figures up to 29 August make grim reading. Not only has this summer experienced just 399 hours of sunshine, it has also been cool, with a mean temperature of 14C (57F), some 0.4C below the long term average.</p> <p>The Met Office does not expect summer rainfall (currently at 366.8mm) to exceed the 384.4mm seen in the summer of 1912, and Scotland has escaped relatively lightly with 357mm.</p> <p>This will come as cold comfort to millions of Britons who have endured the damp weather. It is shaping up to be the fourth wettest summer since records began in 1727.</p> <p>Torrential rain on Wednesday night forced people in Cumbria from their homes and about 20 elderly men and women were moved to an emergency shelter at Egremont market hall after a power cut.</p> <p>Egremont and the Calder valley were the worst affected parts of west Cumbria, with 15mm of rain recorded in just 15 minutes at Calder Hall, and a total of 52mm recorded between 10pm and 4am on Thursday.</p> <p>Passengers on the derailed train were on their way to work at Sellafield when it ran into the landslip at 6.45am. Despite the large amount of mud and debris on the tracks, the train stayed upright.</p> <p>Alan Isles was on board. He described how fellow travellers screamed out as the train hit the landslide, sending debris flying over the carriages.</p> <p>Isles, from Workington, said: \"As we were coming round a corner, there was no deceleration at all and we suddenly felt a large impact. A lot of people screamed out as the train derailed and many were disorientated. We were worried about rolling over, but luckily we didn't. The staff were great and took control straight away.\"</p> <p>A second train sent to the scene to transport the stranded passengers to Sellafield also encountered a landslide and had to return to Nethertown. Passengers were escorted to the nearest road for their onward journey.</p> <p>Network Rail said the derailment, about a mile south of St Bees station, happened in a remote area with no easy road access. Engineers spent the day removing rubble and carrying out repairs. There will be an investigation by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch.</p> <p>Following the severe weather, Cumbria fire service said it received more than 100 calls for help, mainly involving requests for sandbags. A spokesman said: \"Some people have had to be evacuated and many have made their own way out of their flooded houses.\"</p> <p>Cumbria police said drains were unable to cope after the river Ehen and several becks in the Egremont area burst their banks.</p> <p>Emma Jane Taylor said floodwater began entering her St Bees home shortly before midnight on Wednesday. \"We've had heavy rain here before, but it's never been this bad. I alerted some neighbours, but within 30 minutes it was through my front door and coming up through my floorboards. At the moment you can paddle across my floor.\"</p> <p>Earlier this week the rear of a four-storey house in Egremont collapsed into the river Ehen after heavy rain.</p> <p>Forecasters say Friday will bring largely dry and fine weather for England and Wales, turning cloudier in the north and west later.</p>",
  "<p>When we talk about technology, we tend to think of computers, smartphones or operating systems. Is Android better than Apple? Does Nokia make better phones than HTC? The prosaic stuff \u2013 fridges, washing machines and cookers \u2013 get overlooked, possibly because we don't upgrade them as often as our smartphones, tablets and cameras.</p> <p>Yet we use those pieces of kit as regularly and arguably as intimately as we do our phones. You might not be able to put a picture of your dog or your baby on your fridge as wallpaper, but you probably go to it as many times a day as, say, you snap a picture on your smartphone.</p> <p>So if you haven't been in the market for a new dishwasher recently, you might have missed out on just how much that prosaic but vital home appliance technology has moved on.</p> <p>Now there are fridges that can tell you what's in them as you're on your way home and suggest what you might make for supper, and dishwashers that use a mineral byproduct of mining to dry your plates in order to save energy.</p> <p>Siemens showed off its incoming connected-home technology at IFA in Berlin on Thursday, and the future for your appliances is really rather fun.</p> <p>Take that fridge. What's in yours? Mine probably contains some butter, a handful of eggs, some tomatoes and a hunk of cheese, along with a bottle of Diet Coke and some raspberries I bought at the weekend and which are on the cusp of going off. That's from memory, but in a couple of years' time, your fridge will have two cameras in it and recognition software.</p> <p>In a couple of years' time \u2013 probably around 2014, according to Siemens \u2013 your fridge will be able to send that information to an app on your smartphone, and from that list of ingredients, offer you a choice of recipes for what you might fancy for supper. If you haven't got everything the recipe needs, it will also generate a shopping list so that you can stop off at the supermarket on the way home and pick up the remaining ingredients.</p> <p>Once you're home, complete with your shopping, you can pull up that recipe on your tablet. Siemens demonstrated the app on an iPad but says support for Android is coming. But as you chop up the tomatoes for the quiche the app suggested you make, your fingers are going to be sticky and you don't want them on your pristine tablet's screen.</p> <p>No problem: send it to the motion-sensitive projector installed next to the cooker and have it projected down on to your work surface. That projection is touch-sensitive, so you can scroll through the pages on the wipe-clean worktop.</p> <p>Ready to put the oven on? The app will send the temperature and timer information to the cooker. All you have to do is assemble the ingredients and put them in the oven.</p> <p>Once you're done with your meal, load the dirty dishes into the dishwasher, which, when you bought it, had to be told how hard the water is where you live. The connected dishwasher will be able to do that for you too: the tablet app uses the device's location settings to check online what the water hardness is in your area and then beams that information to the dishwasher to set it automatically.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395459759\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346344916832/Siemens-dishwasher-app-ap-009.jpg\" alt=\"Siemens dishwasheer app app checking water hardness\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Siemens dishwasher app checking water hardness.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Siemens</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the dishwasher has finished with your plates, rather than using more energy to blast hot air at them to dry them, Siemens' appliances instead use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeolite\" title=\"\">zeolites</a>, which heat up when they come into contact with water: the heat they use dries the plates and cutlery inside the dishwasher, reducing electricity.</p> <p>What about a cup of coffee? Your coffeemaker will be able to tell you, again via the app, if it's got enough beans in it or if you need to add some more. But what if it goes wrong? Via the tablet app, you will be able to connect by video to customer support, where the person on the other end of the camera will be able to access your device remotely to tell you what the problem is.</p> <p>All of this sounds futuristic, but in fact it builds on existing technology that we already have in place in our homes. Siemens says its connected-home appliances will work with your Wi-Fi network, and won't require vast dollops of bandwidth to use the internet-based functions, such as connecting to customer service: even a ropey 2Mbps connection will cope with the remote customer service function.</p> <p>All of this is part of \"the internet of things\": right now you might have half a dozen things that connect to the web. In the not too distant future, more and more hitherto \"dumb\" physical objects \u2013 such as fridges and dishwashers \u2013 will be equipped with devices that allow them to communicate with the web, become part of the internet \u2013 and crucially, interact with us.</p> <p>Your car will be able to download content from the web to keep the kids entertained on a long journey, and also book itself in for a service; your printer won't need you to respond to warnings about low ink but will simply go online and order it in the background. The connected home is just part of it.</p>",

Every international student looks crushed after the north London university became the first in the UK to be stripped by the Home Office of its ability to sponsor foreign learners.</p> <p>What these students fear most is that if they don't, by some miracle, get themselves a place at a new university within the next few months, they will be removed from the country.</p> <p>Cecil Ezeja, 21, from Enugu state in Nigeria was the great hope for his family. Now he dreads the moment when he has to tell his family that his year of studying electronic communications and the \u00a310,080 they paid has come to naught.</p> <p>\"I can't call them, I don't want to cause any heartbreak \u2026 I want to visit some other unis [first] to see if they can accept me.\"</p> <p>But he knows, like many others, that the timing, just before the start of the academic year, means it is unlikely that another university will have a spare place especially since he is midway through his degree. \"If it was in June or July \u2026 I would have more time to apply for [different] uni \u2026 I'm very upset,\" he said. \"The decision was made at the wrong time. I'm not an [immigration] threat. I came to this country on 3 September 2011 and I've not broken any tiny law.</p> <p>\"I'm just a student. I come to school in the morning, I go back to my house, I go to the library. I haven't done anything \u2026 Maybe there's a few people that are breaking the law but they should investigate [them] not sack all the students, punish everybody.\"</p> <p>For Mohammed Islam, 23, from Bangladesh, it is the second time he has enrolled for a law degree and found himself at an institution suddenly stripped of its ability to host foreign students. \"I came here in 2009, to a college. When I was back home, I don't know which place was a college, because on the website they're all saying they're really good, everything is OK. But when you are not [there] in person, you can not understand what is going on.</p> <p>\"So I came to a college and they had the same problem, they [the Home Office] cancelled their licence. I was in deep water.\"</p> <p>Now he's in deep water again. \"I have to find a new uni and if I can't I have to go back.\"</p> <p>He has not told his parents but hopes they are prepared to stump up another \u00a310,000 to pay for his degree.</p> <p>\"I have a dream,\" he said. \"To finish my LLB from a good university from the UK. This is my main dream.\"</p> <p>Inside the university help centre, the phones are ringing off the hook. Ursula Rehman, from Dubai, looks desperate.</p> <p>She has just one semester to go to complete her degree in biomedical sciences and is not having any luck moving to another university.</p> <p>\"I've spoken to so many universities now and they say, 'oh we don't do transfers, we don't do this, or we'll have to charge you this much'.\" She's exasperated. Everyone, she says, is worried and scared.</p> <p>\"I've got so many friends who come from really poor backgrounds. And they come here so that they have a degree and they go back and get a really good job, because they've got a degree from London UK. And now \u2026\"</p> <p>Tellingly, she has not told her parents either. \"I don't want them to panic, and I hope they don't hear it from somewhere.\"</p> <p>She blames herself for the whole debacle. Rehman says she should have accepted one of the other four university places she was offered three years ago.</p> <p>\"I know its my fault, but I'm really getting tense now.\" Staring down at the floor she adds, \"why did I come here?\".</p> <p>It is a very good question.</p>",
  "<p>In his barnstormer of a speech to the swooning crowd at the Republican national convention on Wednesday night, Paul Ryan laid a mound of misdeeds at President Obama's door. To sustained applause from the floor, the vice-presidential candidate accused Obama of raiding Medicare, lying to auto workers and turning his back on the poor. But the speech (<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80423.html\">transcript here</a>) was not always at pains to adhere to the historical record. At times, we are disappointed to report, Ryan baldly lied. Here's a round-up of Ryan's most audacious untruths:</p> <h2>Medicare</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And the biggest, coldest power play of all in Obamacare came at the expense of the elderly \u2026 So they just took it all away from Medicare. Seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars, funneled out of Medicare by President Obama.</p> </blockquote> <p>Barack Obama's budget plan calls for $716bn in cuts to Medicare spending over the next 10 years, but in reimbursements to insurers and hospitals, not in payments to beneficiaries, which would be preserved. </p> <p>Ryan knows this because he has written these same cuts in to successive drafts of his famed budget. The cuts are <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/undoing-obama-medicare-cuts-may-backfire-romney\">designed to extend the solvency</a> of Medicare for an estimated eight years. Repealing the cuts would likely<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/22/us/politics/costs-seen-in-romneys-medicare-savings-plan.html\"> increase payments by hundreds of dollars a year for beneficiaries</a>, who share costs with the government. </p> <p>Politifact has weighed in on Ryan's Medicare claim and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/29/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-said-president-obama-funneled-716-billio/\">found it to be \"mostly false.\"</a></p> <h2>Ryan's hometown GM plant</h2> <p>Ryan said Obama held out false hope to workers in his hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin, that a GM plant there could be saved. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A lot of guys I went to high school with worked at that GM plant. Right there at that plant, Obama said: 'I believe that if our government is there to support you \u2026 this plant will be here for another hundred years.' That's what he said in 2008. Well, as it turned out, that plant didn't last another year.</p> </blockquote> <p> Ryan accurately quotes Obama, who visited the plant as a presidential candidate in February 2008. Four months later, GM announced the plant would drastically scale back production. The plant laid off most of its workforce in December 2008, before Obama took office. The \"government support\" Obama spoke of \u2013 his auto bailout plan, which took effect in early 2009 \u2013 did not arrive early enough to save the Janesville plant, but it is credited with saving the American auto industry. </p> <p>The full audacity of this attack cannot be appreciated without noting that Ryan's would-be boss, Mitt Romney, published an op-ed in the New York Times in November 2008 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/opinion/19romney.html\">under the headline Let Detroit Go Bankrup</a>t.</p> <h2>Government debt</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Obama] created a bipartisan debt commission. They came back with an urgent report. He thanked them, sent them on their way and then did exactly nothing.</p> </blockquote> <p>In early 2010 Obama created a bipartisan committee known as Bowles-Simpson to figure out how to balance the budget and hand its recommendations to the president. The final draft of the committee's report failed to win the necessary support of its members, however, falling three votes short. Paul Ryan was on the committee, a fact that he neglected to mention in his speech. In the straw poll on the final draft, he voted \"no\" \u2013 against the plan that he now accuses the president of ignoring.</p> <h2>Aid to the poor</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have responsibilities, one to another \u2013 we do not each face the world alone. And the greatest of all responsibilities, is that of the strong to protect the weak. The truest measure of any society is how it treats those who cannot defend or care for themselves \u2026 We can make the safety net safe again.</p> </blockquote> <p>If Paul Ryan's budget is notable for anything, it's for cuts to Medicaid and other programs on which low-income households depend. As the Washington Post economics blogger <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/29/everything-you-know-about-paul-ryans-budget-is-probably-wrong/\">Ezra Klein points out: </a>\"The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities ran the numbers and said two-thirds of Ryan's cuts will end up falling on programs for the poor.\" </p> <p>The Ryan plan cuts spending on Medicaid and other health assistance programs for the poor from just over 3% of GDP to just over 1%. It cuts home mortgage deductions, veteran's benefits, farm subsidies and other aid programs.</p> <h2>Credit rating downgrade</h2> <p>Ryan said the president was responsible for Standard and Poor's downgrading US credit from AAA to AA+ in August 2011. He said of Obama's first term:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It began with a perfect Triple-A credit rating for the United States; it ends with a downgraded America.</p> </blockquote> <p>In fact, the downgrade was the result of refusal of Republicans in Congress to vote to raise the debt ceiling, despite pressure from the White House and most outside analysts. </p> <p>So stubborn was the Republican resistance that treasury secretary Timothy Geithner suggested the president could <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/30/tim-geithner-14th-amendment_n_887925.html\">unilaterally raise the ceiling</a> under the 14th amendment. Ultimately the Republicans capitulated, but the damage was done; days after the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed, the rating was cut. </p> <p>In its statement on the rationale behind the downgrade, Standard and Poor's blamed the political circus: \"The political brinksmanship of recent months highlights what we see as America's governance and policymaking becoming less stable, less effective, and less predictable than what we previously believed.\"</p>",
  "<p>So many Indians apply to study at London Metropolitan that a few years ago the university opened recruitment offices in Delhi and Chennai.</p> <p>But on Thursday both branches had been shut down. In the Delhi towerblock where the university had an outpost as recently as 31 July, a financial consulting firm had stuck a print-out of its own logo over the Met's and the university's letterbox in the basement was overflowing.</p> <p>Across the hallway from the old offices on the seventh floor of the Ashoka Estate, Puneet Soin said he was shocked to hear about the UK Border Agency (UKBA) decision. \"If they can take away London Met's licence, they can take away any other university's licence,\" said Soin, who manages the Indian office of Study In UK (SIUK), a commercial firm which helps students win places at UK universities and colleges. His staff had been fielding calls from anxious Indian students worried they could be deported from Britain, or not get beyond passport control at Heathrow.</p> <p>SIUK has 10 wannabe students who were hoping to enrol at London Met in the next few weeks, paying annual fees of \u00a310,000 or more for the privilege; they are now hurriedly trying to find places at other universities in the UK capital. It's proving surprisingly easy.</p> <p>\"Literally five minutes before you arrived I had an email from a rival London university offering to fast track the application of anyone who had been planning to come to London Met,\" said Soin at teatime on Thursday. He wasn't prepared to name the sender.</p> <p>Soin, himself an engineering graduate of Warwick University, regularly used to dispatch students across the hall to talk to recruiters from London Met, and said he had a number of meetings with Mark Bickerton, director of the university's international office.</p> <p>\"Before this UKBA stuff, Mark told me that they were closing down the India offices to save money. He said they wanted to spend it on scholarships for Indian students,\" said Soin.</p> <p>He claimed Bickerton wrote him an email just last week saying he was confident the university would win back its licence to teach and recruit international students, and that SIUK should simply encourage applicants to defer until the February 2013 intake.</p> <p>Soin said it was well known that many Indians applying to UK universities had no intention of studying. \"We divide the market into two categories: the university market for genuine students and the immigration market,\" he said, stressing that his company only worked with the former. \"It's easy to tell someone who just wants to get the visa,\" he said. \"They are the ones who turn up and say: 'Get me into a UK university, here's my budget,' without specifying which university or which course they fancy.\"</p>",

  "<p>Without hearing a note of their second album, you might already detect a new sense of purpose about the Vaccines. For one thing, there's the title. Their debut album slunk into the shops under the name What Did You Expect From the Vaccines?, an apologetic shrug amid a storm of hype. Here, instead, is a cocksure statement of confidence and maturity. For another, there's the way they look now. Gone are their nondescript, preppy clothes, replaced by lank, centre-parted hair, skintight jeans and the kind of denim cut-off known to&#xa0;metal fans as a battle jacket. It's all presumably intended to communicate the same message expressed by vocalist Justin Young in a recent interview: \"We&#xa0;don't want to be an indie band any&#xa0;more, we want to be a rock band.\"</p> <p>There's something charmingly gauche and gung-ho about signalling your new rock direction by dressing up&#xa0;like the front row of the Swindon Leisure Centre the night <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XH-nErgnO8\" title=\"\">Saxon's Strong Arm of the Law Tour '80 hit town</a>; it's like indicating your new album has a reggae influence by insisting every member wear those <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/products/catalog?q=rasta+hat&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=shop&amp;cid=5811317929380144618&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qBM-ULa9MoHU0QX2nYGADQ&amp;ved=0CCgQ8wIwAQ\" title=\"\">fancy dress shop rasta hats</a> with the fake dreadlocks attached. Still, the Vaccines' new assurance and vaulting ambition seems a little hard to square with Come of Age's two singles, both of which find Young agonising over his own shortcomings as a rock star. On the peppy Teenage Icon, he proclaims himself \"ordinary \u2026 average \u2026 out of shape with messy hair \u2026 not magnetic\". Opener No Hope, meanwhile, buffs up the trebly sound found on their debut until it sounds suitably epic, while Young impersonates the poisonous, bug-eyed sneer Bob Dylan <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBmHDPk96Xs\" title=\"\">patented in the mid-60s</a>: \"The whole thing feels like an exercise in trying to be someone I would rather not be.\" This is a funny thing to sing while you're audibly doing an impression of another artist. Maybe it's a clever metatextual joke, or maybe Young just hasn't really thought it through; either way, you get the point about his discomfort as a frontman.</p> <p>It goes without saying that an awareness of your own shortcomings and a sense of unease are not characteristics befitting a would-be rock god: it seems highly unlikely there were waves of self-doubt emanating from vocalist \"Biff\" Byford the night Saxon's Strong Arm of the Law Tour '80 hit Swindon Leisure Centre. Nevertheless, it's discomfort rather than confidence that runs through Come of Age, a noticeably more tentative record than the Vaccines are talking it up to be. The&#xa0;sense of a band with ambitions to be something other than what they currently are is strong, but so is the sense that they haven't really worked out what it is they want to be.</p> <p>Aside from the Dylan impersonation, there are tracks on which the Vaccines do that thing indie bands aiming for greater heaviness always do and write boring songs with riffs but no tunes: maintaining a certain standard, the Vaccines' boring songs with riffs but no&#xa0;tunes are every bit as boring as the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOTRx3ZqjjI\" title=\"\">Arctic Monkeys' boring songs with riffs but no tunes</a>. More successful are Aftershave Ocean's stab at a Teenage Fanclub jangle, and All in Vain's attempt at classic 60s pop, complete with George Harrison-inspired slide guitar.</p> <p>Amid all the trying-on of other people's styles, the most successful tracks are the ones that stick to what the Vaccines did on their debut, albeit in a slightly more opaque way. With lyrics in which Young imagines himself \"bewitching and enthralling all the boys\", I Wish I Was a Girl attempts to conjure up an atmosphere of louche sexual ambiguity. On that level, it's a failure \u2013 it feels about as louche and sexually ambiguous as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOiuDAPHxCE\" title=\"\">Gertcha by Chas and Dave</a> \u2013 but musically it's terrific: winding, crepuscular, decorated with spikes of Pixies-esque guitar. The dolorous twang of Weirdo is beautifully controlled, threatening to burst into something more direct, but never quite doing it. The closing Lonely World balances its&#xa0;anthemic ambitions against an off-kilter, trudging beat, a weird combination that somehow works.</p> <p>Come of Age isn't a bad album, but nor is it the swaggering bid for world domination it's made out to be: it's too confused and incoherent. But if it isn't going to propel them skywards, there's enough decent songs on it to keep the Vaccines ticking over in their current position. Given that their current position is as virtually the only new British alt-rock band to sell any albums, that's hardly a disaster, even if it's clearly not what the Vaccines had in mind. But as someone listening to Justin Young agonizing about his inadequacies might gently suggest: sometimes you have to be content with what you are.</p>",
  "<p>He is the ghost at the banquet. The absence whose name and whose policies shall not be uttered. That is George W Bush. Two-time Republican president. Last president of that political flavour. And in the most recent of memory.</p> <p>He is the president who \u2013 by and large \u2013 this Republican convention would airbrush from its political history. But why?</p> <p>The former president's brother Jeb Bush, recently said in an interview with ABC: \"[My brother] knows that he will be a target. The president has spent a lot of time and energy around this notion that: 'I can't do anything about it. It's all Bush's fault. You know I'm trying, but it's not working because it's Bush's fault.'\"</p> <p>The only visible presence of the legacy of the Bush years \u2013 by the time the convention finishes \u2013 will have been an appearance by Condoleezza Rice and a brief video appearance by George W himself who has endorsed Mitt Romney as potentially a \"great president\" by almost remote control.</p> <p>Indeed it has been left almost to Rice alone to defend Bush's record, saying on Wednesday: \"President Bush led in really, really difficult times. He kept us safe. He led with honour and integrity. I think the American people are seeing that and history will judge him on that.\"</p> <p>In some respects it is understandable. Bush left the White House in 2008 with dismal approval ratings which \u2013 despite some minor retrospective improvement \u2013 still paints him as a deeply unpopular and divisive figure.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-race-bush-legacy-looming-over-gop-by-video-only-not-attending-and-seldom-mentioned/2012/08/29/6cfd1116-f22a-11e1-b74c-84ed55e0300b_story.html\" title=\"\">Washington Post has pointed out</a> avoiding the real Bush legacy in the coming weeks of the campaign may be a little more difficult to do than dodging the figure of the man himself.</p> <p>As the paper pointed out on Wednesday: \"Many of the stimulus and bailout programmes Republicans like to skewer Obama for actually originated with Bush. And the deep recession that confronted Obama began in December 2007 when Bush was still president.\"</p> <p>It is all in stark contrast to the role that former Democratic president Bill Clinton will play at the Democrat Convention in North Carolina where he will introduce Obama.</p> <p>In a post for The New Republic \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/106726/the-gops-unreckoning-the-disappeared-dubya\" title=\"\">The GOP's Unreckoning With The Disappeared Dubya</a> \u2013 Alec MacGillis interviewed convention delegates in Tampa. \"The last year of Bush's presidency, he was despised by a lot of people,\" MacGillis was told by one, 32-year-old Andrew Lee.</p> <p>In truth, Bush said months ago that he would not attend the convention in Tampa but as <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/30/gop-convention-mitt-romney-george-w-bush_n_1840655.html\" title=\"\">Dan Froomkin argues in the Huffington Post</a> his absence has created a \"metaphysical problem\".</p> <p>\"That's because,\" Froomkin argues, \"Bush's very existence belies two of the most critical selling points of GOP nominee Mitt Romney's presidential campaign: that tax cuts for the rich will create jobs, and that Romney is bringing a fresh new approach that can turn the country's fortunes around.\"</p> <p>In other words, the denial of the Bush legacy is a political gamble for Republicans \u2013 in trying to disavow the man can they avoid disavowing what he stood for, not least at a time when Obama is still managing to make political capital out of the costly failures of the Bush years including trillions spent on two failing wars and damaging tax cuts.</p> <p>Which means that Romney must not only demonstrate that he is the Un-Obama but the Un-Bush too.</p>",
  "<p>In 1985, after being captured following the murder of a Spanish businessman, Sebasti\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez was sentenced to 84 years in prison for his part in the killing and other leftwing terrorist attacks.</p> <p>On Thursday night, however, the Spaniard will line up on the blocks for the final of the men's 50m freestyle S5 at the Aquatics Centre, in a bid to add a 13th Paralympic medal to what must be one of the most extraordinary CVs of any London 2012 athlete.</p> <p>Rodr\u00edguez, now 55, prefers not to talk about his time as a member of Grapo, an ultra-leftwing armed group listed by the EU as a terrorist organisation. \"I only want to talk about sport now,\" he said in 2000, when his violent past emerged after the Sydney Games, in which he won five gold medals and broke four world records.</p> <p>The Spaniard lost the use of both legs while in prison after going on hunger strike for 432 days, but had told Paralympic officials he had been injured in a road accident. Despite calls for him to be stripped of the medals, the International Paralympic Committee ruled that he had not broken any Games rules and would be allowed to keep his awards.</p> <p>\"If we start knocking back athletes because of their political or personal or moral or religious persuasions, we get into very deep water,\" a spokeswoman from the Sydney Paralympic organising committee said at the time.</p> <p>He went on to win further medals at Athens and Beijing.</p> <p>Rodr\u00edguez was 26 in September 1984 when he was a member of a gang which assassinated Rafael Padura, a Seville business leader. In 1990, he refused food in a bid to have jailed Grapo members brought together in one prison, coming close to death at points and ultimately losing the use of his legs.</p> <p>In 1994 Rodr\u00edguez was paroled under a Spanish law which says the seriously ill should not be kept in prison and in 2007 he received a government pardon despite protests from Padura's family, who said he had never expressed remorse.</p> <p>\"The past cannot be erased,\" Rodr\u00edguez has been reported as saying. \"There is no use in beating me in the chest and demanding that I repent.\"</p> <p>The Maoist group, which never had widespread support, has never formally dissolved but has not been active since 2007, according to Spanish police.</p> <p>Earlier on Thursday, Rodr\u00edguez won his heat in the S5 50m freestyle \u2013 in which he holds the world record \u2013 qualifying second fastest for the final. He will also compete in the men's 100m and 200m freestyle and the 4x100m freestyle relay.</p> <p>Speaking after his heat, Rodr\u00edguez described the atmosphere at the Games as amazing. \"You are making us feel like what we aim to be, like what we are, like what we hope in future will be increasingly accepted that we are, like 100% sportspeople.\"</p>",
  "<p>Iran's leaders clearly hoped this week's<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2012/aug/29/un-secretary-general-ban-tehran-non-aligned-movement-summit\" title=\"\"> gala summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Tehran</a> would serve as an antidote to the diplomatic isolation imposed on them by the US and Britain. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/mohamed-morsi\" title=\"\">Mohamed Morsi</a>, Egypt's wonderfully unpredictable new president, making the first visit at this level since the 1979 Iranian revolution, had other ideas.</p> <p>Morsi's fierce condemnation of the Syrian regime, Iran's close ally, was as eloquent as it was piercing, and it came like a bolt from the blue. He didn't just rain on the Iranians' parade. It was as if Hurricane Isaac had taken a sharp turn north across the Caspian and unleashed its wrathful furies on an unsuspecting Tehran.</p> <p>The Syrian delegation walked out. The Iranians did not have that option \u2013 they could hardly boycott their own meeting. Instead they were forced to listen as Morsi, a Muslim Brother, an Arab, and lifelong critic of western policy in the Middle East, thumped out an uncompromising speech that could have come straight from Hillary Clinton's playbook.</p> <p>\"We should all express our full support to the struggle of those who are demanding freedom and justice in Syria and translate our sympathies into a clear political vision that supports peaceful transfer (of power) to a democratic system,\" Morsi told the 120-country summit.</p> <p>Morsi said the world had a \"moral duty\" to back the Syrian opposition, whom he provocatively likened to the Palestinians, in their struggle \"against an oppressive regime that has lost its legitimacy\". Forceful intervention (he did not propose military action) was essential to prevent a further descent into civil war and sectarianism, he said. <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gqnS16ZgOEJ5-LfejAGQer-Nmidw?docId=6c61afdb79064b378c5cdb962404afe7\" title=\"\">The fractured Syrian opposition must unite under one banner</a>.</p> <p>Morsi's speech all but completed Iran's isolation. That Russia continues to block effective UN action cannot disguise the fact that among all the \u2013 mostly Arab \u2013 countries of the region, non-Arab Iran is out on a limb over Syria, just as it is over its suspect nuclear programme.</p> <p>Morsi's stand was typically courageous. For many Egyptians their president's autonomy of thought and deed may be a matter of growing pride. This is the same man, after all, who boldly asserted civilian control over the military after his election victory, summarily dismissing the country's post-Mubarak leader, Field Marshal Mohammed Hussein Tantawi, the military's chief of staff, and the heads of Egypt's army, navy and air force.</p> <p>And even as he bearded the Iranian leadership on their own patch, Morsi has made clear that Egypt's fawning subservience to Washington, evident during the long Mubarak years, is also a thing of the past.</p> <p>His decision to travel to Iran at all was a signal of his independence. So, too, is his apparent determination to restore Egypt to its historic role as the Middle East's leading nation, a position coveted by Iran.</p> <p>Egypt <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/visit-by-egypts-morsi-to-iran-reflects-foreign-policy-shift/2012/08/27/4baf4b3a-f060-11e1-b74c-84ed55e0300b_story.html?wprss=rss_middle-east\" title=\"\">would seek to expand its ties with all fellow Muslim</a> nations, Morsi's spokesman, Yasser Ali, said. \"We need to establish relations with all countries worldwide\u2026 We will turn more agile, more active.</p> <p>\"Egypt is a pivotal country, and we want to play the role Egypt deserves to play.\"</p> <p>While the Obama administration will undoubtedly welcome Morsi's comments on Syria and the implicit rebuke to Tehran, the Egyptian president's confident assertion of national interests is already causing ripples of unease. Dennis Ross, a Bush-era Middle East envoy, complained that Morsi was trying to gag the press by replacing 50 leading editors and journalists and was ignoring other key democratic \"principles\" (as defined by Ross).</p> <p>Ross said: \"None of this means that Egypt's path of change is foreordained. It does mean that the president, who has largely surrounded himself with members of the Muslim Brotherhood or sympathisers, dominates all of Egypt's institutions of power.\" If Morsi stepped too far out of line, the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dennis-ross-egypts-new-leaders-must-accept-reality/2012/08/19/46e60810-e8ad-11e1-936a-b801f1abab19_story.html\" title=\"\">US should consider suspending direct financial assistance and blocking IMF loans</a>, Ross suggested.</p> <p>Morsi's intervention will encourage Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states in their active support for the Syrian uprising. It may, in time, foster an increasingly interventionist, united Arab front against Bashar al-Assad's regime, as happened in Libya after the Arab League turned against Muammar Gaddafi. Given the myriad pre-existing tensions between the Sunni Muslim Gulf states and predominantly Shia Muslim Iran, the development of such a front would logically serve to further restrain Tehran's ambitions.</p> <p>But regarding an end to the Syrian slaughter and a peaceful transfer of power, Morsi's contribution in Tehran must be kept in perspective.</p> <p>In terms of changing facts on the ground, or substantively altering the egregiously negative Syrian dynamic, it may have scant impact.</p> <p>Morsi's plan for a contact group comprising Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran was already opposed by the US and others. After his uncompromising Tehran performance, it will go precisely nowhere.</p> <p>The proposal by Francois Hollande, the French president, that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/27/hollande-syrian-rebels-provisional-government?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">opposition be recognised as Syria's legitimate government</a> ignored the fact there is not one Syrian opposition but several. Turkey lacks the will to go it alone in creating safe zones inside Syria, preferring UN and preferably Nato cover. And in European capitals, as in Washington, there is no more appetite for direct intervention than when the uprising began in March last year. Assad, the hollow man, meanwhile claims things are getting \"better\".</p> <p>Despite 20,000 Syrian dead and the maiming and traumatising of generations of young people, the civil war shows no sign of stopping, may even be getting worse. \"The bloodletting in Syria is the responsibility of all of us\u2026 the Syrian crisis is bleeding our hearts,\" Morsi said. He is right \u2013 and when was the last time an Egyptian president spoke for the world? But after his speech, significant and stirring though it was, the world is no nearer to finding a solution.</p>",

Listen here<br></a><br><strong>Hometown: </strong>Boston, Massachusetts.</p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Dane Orr (instruments) and Anna Wise (vocals).</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> Sonnymoon's music is woozy, magical, mysterious, hypnotic, quixotic. Other words that occurred while we were listening to their self-titled album, released this autumn, included: squelchy, fantastic, phantasmic, plasmic, plastic, spasmic, orgasmic. It is liquid and loose, unconventional and unorthodox. It jerks and juts out at ridiculous angles, but it can also be smooth and easy on the ear. At various points it will seem as though you are listening to an electronica record, at other times to an R&amp;B one, a jazz one, an avant-garde one, even a pop one. Some of the songs will sound like all of the above, at once, while others will make you wonder whether you are listening to a brand new, as yet unnamed genre.</p> <p><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/sonnymoonmusic\" title=\"\">Their SoundCloud says they come from Earth</a> but they are out of this world. Actually, the two members of Sonnymoon met at the prestigious <a href=\"http://www.berklee.edu\" title=\"\">Berklee College of Music</a>, where Dane Orr was studying saxophone and Anna Wise was studying singing. This is the third time in recent weeks that we have featured former alumni of Berklee \u2013 members of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/16/new-band-big-black-delta\" title=\"\">Big Black Delta</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/13/new-band-king\" title=\"\">King</a> were attendees, although even their proggy synth-pop and psychedelic soul weren't quite as free-flowing and far-out as this \u2013 their standout qualities are Orr's individualistic approach to computers and keyboards, and Wise's vocals, which are more of a series of cute hiccups than anything that could conventionally be termed \"singing\". There are some clues as to how the album sounds from the label that will be releasing it: Plug Research, the LA imprint responsible for Flying Lotus's debut album, plus releases from Dntel, Daedalus, John Tejada, Thomas Fehlman and Bilal.</p> <p>Some of the songs on the album rank alongside the finest we've heard all year. Greatness is the first piece of music we've heard in a while that sounds as though it is familiar with the work of early-80s punk-jazz combo <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4VXo4gu2Vk\" title=\"\">Rip Rig and Panic</a>. Instruments come and go, and there's a bit where cooing gives way to whispering, which is a delight. \u221e is an odyshape of a title appropriate for music that shimmers, stalls, slants sideways, skips and skedaddles, goes skew-whiff, and generally stops short of being a song with a discernible melody while still being more pop than anything else. Then an irresistible sitar impinges on this idiosyncratic influx of iridescence. Kali is loping cool jazz, like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwL9xf3YQ-4\" title=\"\">Manhattan Transfer</a> on Mandrax, or the xx <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkbGiKJ_Sjk\" title=\"\">in a Soho bar in 1958 surrounded by beatniks</a>. Think the girl from Ipanema if she read Pitchfork. It's slovenly and/or intricately constructed \u2013 we can't decide which. Possibly both. Or neither. We are not alone in our estimation of its strangeness: \"Kali sounds like Alice Coltrane's rhythm section borrowed the Tardis and popped by the studio,\" wrote one blogger. See?</p> <p>Watersboiled is within bleeping distance of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jul/21/micachu-and-the-shapes-interview\" title=\"\">Micachu</a> and her Shapes and recalls a dream we once had of post-punk girl group <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwUCW6ohi2E\" title=\"\">the Raincoats</a> before we actually heard them. It features Wise repeating the phrase \"Make sure your water's boiled\" over weird sci-fi synth sounds and not much else. Good advice, that. Flit Fleet Float is almost onomatopoeic, although the ratio of flitting and fleeting to floating is distinctly balanced in favour of the former. Mild Rumpus is an appropriate title for a lot of this stuff now that we think of it, while Nothing Thought is clicky and glitchy, its hip-hop techniques failing to disguise a pop lusciousness. There's even a song called Universal Appeal.

  "<p>By a bitter, depressing twist of irony the scene of the latest battleground in the Ulster loyalist marching controversies happens to be a holy place that once symbolised Protestant-Catholic co-operation. </p> <p>St Patrick's is the second oldest Catholic church in Belfast and its construction at the start of the 19th century was helped on its way partly by the generosity of Protestants in the city. Two centuries later the church in Upper Donegall Street has become a fresh focal point for trouble.</p> <p>It all started on 12 July - loyalism's most sacred day. A loyalist band from the nearby Shankill Road were captured by Sinn Fein activists on film playing a sectarian tune outside the shut doors of St Patrick's. </p> <p>As they wheeled around the street they played a song mocking the Irish famine, a ditty that urges Scottish Catholics of Irish origin to \"go home\" now that the famine is long over. </p> <p>Naturally, the secret filming, when it was broadcast, outraged even moderate nationalists, given that it showed utter disrespect for a place of worship. </p> <p>It also prompted the Parades Commission - the body that adjudicates on disputed Orange Order and other loyalist marches - to impose new restrictions on future marches passing St Patrick's. <br><br>The Parades Commission ruled that no songs were to be played as loyalist bands filed past St Patrick's last Saturday, the traditional final day of the Ulster marching season when the Protestant Royal Black Preceptory parade all over Northern Ireland. </p> <p>The Commission also banned the Shankill Road band, the Young Conway Volunteers, from passing the church. </p> <p>However, not only did the Young Conway Volunteers defy the ruling but a slew of other Kick-the-Pope style bands marched past St Patrick's (possibly in solidarity with their Shankill colleagues) and blared out their music.</p> <p>This defiance enraged a group of nationalists protesting against the march and for a brief period there was some hand-to-hand fighting on Donegall Street between both sides. </p> <p>Riot squad officers had to intervene while the whole scene around this northern corner of Belfast city centre crackled with menace, the atmosphere poisonous with sectarian hatred. </p> <p>Normally that would be the end of it all \u2013 for this year at least. Once the Blackmen, as they are known colloquially to all communities, march, the season of parading finishes. </p> <p>But 2012 will be different. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Ulster Convenant, when tens of thousands of unionists pledged to oppose the Liberal government's plans for Home Rule for Ireland, many Ulster Protestants even signing it in their own blood. </p> <p>All of the loyalist marching institutions plan a major rally in the centre of Belfast to mark that anniversary on Saturday 29 September, and once again the main route from the loyalist redoubts of north Belfast includes passage past St Patrick's church.</p> <p>The loyalists' appalling behaviour both on 12 July and last weekend has resulted in the creation of a new tension-point across the many marching routes of Ulster. Nationalists and republicans, Sinn Fein and supporters of more hardline dissident groups, as well non-aligned Catholics, will protest against the presence of loyalist bands (some of whom have strong links to loyalist terrorist groups) passing by this much loved institution of Belfast Catholicism. </p> <p>The scene therefore is set for a potentially major, and possibly violent confrontation at the end of next month.</p> <p>The St Patrick's chapel dispute therefore poses important challenges to a number of key players in post-ceasefire, power-sharing Northern Ireland. </p> <p>The first of these is of course the cross-community regional coalition in Stormont and its dominant political forces - Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist Party. </p> <p>At a meta-political level the DUP and Sinn Fein leadership have established a strong, businesslike working relationship in the day-to-day running of Northern Ireland, personified by first minister Peter Robinson and deputy first minister Martin McGuinness.</p> <p>It is clearly not in either the parties' or the two men's interests if one parade at one single flashpoint causes serious inter-communal damage this autumn. </p> <p>Moreover, the dispute risks disrupting the Sinn Fein-DUP axis, given that even ministers in the cabinet have taken radically opposing positions about the rights and wrongs of the marches past St Patrick's over the summer. </p> <p>McGuinness and Robinson will undoubtedly be expending a lot of energy once the holidays are over seeking to find a compromise before Ulster Convenant day. Otherwise the atmosphere between the two main parties in the power-sharing executive could be further poisoned. </p> <p>For the DUP in particular the party should also recognise there is an inherent danger lurking in this new dispute for their partners in government. </p> <p>Perceptions of loyalist triumphalism and sectarianism on the rise, even outside Catholic churches, can only be good news for Sinn Fein's critics in dissident republicanism who will use any riot or communal confrontation to hoover up new recruits among alienated, unemployed, politically-disconnected nationalist youths. </p> <p>In terms of policing, the PSNI sustained some pointed criticism even from the likes of the head of Belfast's Catholics, Dr Noel Treanor. </p> <p>The bishop was critical about the PSNI's inability last Saturday to enforce the Parades Commission's ruling on bands and sectarian songs outside St Patrick's. </p> <p>The police have vowed to arrest, question and possibly charge those seen openly defying the law last weekend. Yet even if they start to pursue those who broke the ban the next question is how they will react to events on the ground in a month's time? </p> <p>If for instance the Parades Commission imposed another vow of silence as bands passed by St Patrick's, will the PSNI execute that ruling on the streets? Furthermore, just imagine if the Commission decided to re-route altogether Orangemen and loyalist marchers away from Donegall Street, opting instead for the parade to file into Belfast city centre down the Shankill Road. Would this result in a major stand-off security headache for the PSNI? </p> <p>The final group under stress thanks to the emergence of this new flashpoint are the loyalists themselves, or to be more specific, the loyalist terrorist groups such as the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defence Association. </p> <p>These are organisations officially committed not only to ceasefires but to decommissioning their weapons and their military-style structures. In past marching disputes such as Drumcree there is clear evidence that most (but not all) mainstream loyalist groups actually tried to lower tensions along sectarian interfaces and even eventually co-operated with republicans to keep the peace at some of the peace lines. </p> <p>Is it really in the interests of the UVF and UDA leadership's to allow a spontaneous upsurge in violence from its grassroots that could in a worst-case scenario unravel everything they sought to achieve since the 1994 ceasefires? </p> <p>The date of 29 September 2012 could prove to be a pivotal one in 21st century Northern Ireland. It could turn out to be the day the power-sharing politicians on the big hill at Stormont and the community activists on the streets of working-class Belfast demonstrated their ability to defuse a dispute that has deep roots in the sectarian ravaged history of their city. Or it could be the day on which the contradictions between co-operation in politics and confrontation between still rival communities is laid bare for the entire world to see.</p>",
  "<p>Flying into Des Moines, the corn fields look surprisingly green. America's midwest produces half the world's corn and Iowa its largest harvest, yet amid the worst drought in living memory all the untrained eye can see is the occasional brown mark, like a cigarette burn on the baize of a pool table.</p> <p>But appearances can be deceptive.</p> <p>In Boone, Iowa, 30 miles away from the state capital, traffic backs up for miles bringing 200,000 people to Farm Progress, the US's largest agricultural show one. Here, all the talk is of the drought.</p> <p>Pam Johnson, first vice-president of the National Corn Growers Association, says she can't remember one as bad as this in her 40 years of farming. \"My parents say you have to go back to the 1930s for anything comparable,\" she says. In June, her farm in northern Iowa got an inch and a half of rain. \"We usually get that a week. In July we got seven-tenths of an inch, for the month.\" Rain may be coming soon, thanks to hurricane Isaac, but it's too late for America's corn crop.</p> <p>The US planted 97m acres of corn for this year's crop \u2013 the most since 1937. If everything had gone according to plan, this year's harvest would have produced a new record, at close to 15bn bushels of corn (one metric tonne of corn <a href=\"http://www.usda.gov/news/pubs/fbook97/13b.pdf\">is equal to 39.37 bushels</a>). It's too early to say what the final tally will be, but the US department of agriculture has slashed its forecast to 10.8bn. Dan Basse, president of AgResources, an independent agriculture analyst, says that figure is likely to come down. \"We've lost 4bn bushels of corn. That's the largest loss in history, and we could lose another,\" he says. The USDA has declared counties in 38 states to be \"disaster areas\". About 72% of cattle areas are experiencing drought.</p> <p>Corn prices are at record highs, suggesting corn producers might be among the few winners in this situation. But many sold their crop before the drought swept the country, and those with corn to sell now have less of it.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the price hike has set corn producers against livestock farmers and by the end of the year food prices will rise. The spike in food prices is unlikely to be enough to ruffle US consumers. Basse says the people likely to feel it most are the 1.7bn people across the world who get by on $2 a day. \"They are the ones who will really suffer,\" he says. In 2008 drought-driven food price rises led to unrest in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.</p> <p>Things could have been a lot worse this year, says Johnson. She says bio-tech and agricultural innovations have allowed corn to produce even during this record drought. Those still greenish fields are only green thanks to bio-engineered corn, she says. \"If we were using the seeds my parents had used, we would really be in trouble. Those plants would all have fallen over\" she says.</p> <p>But for the livestock industry, it's not enough. Jeff Erb, a Boone county cattleman who farms a few miles from the show, says he has not witnessed a summer this dry since 1985. \"And that was nowhere near as bad,\" he says. \"Temperatures were pushing a hundred for nine, 10 days after another. The creeks are dry, the pastures been gone since June.</p> <p>\"A lot of guys have been using their winter supplies this summer.\"</p> <p>Corn costs are $8 a bushel \u2013 double what he paid last year. A large round bail of hay costs $150-$160 \u2013 also double last year's price. And while his costs have soared, there's little chance cattle farmers will be able to put their prices up. \"We have no control at all,\" he says.</p> <p>Erb says there's no point in blaming corn producers. Others are less sanguine. At the show there are dark words about \"profiteers\" and \"speculators\" but no one wants to attack their fellow farmers on the record. In private, they are lobbying hard. Arkansas congressman Steve Womack is leading a charge to repeal a law that requires 10% of the US's gasoline supply to come from corn-based ethanol \u2013 a law that swallows up to 40% of the country's annual corn production. \"If something isn't done \u2013 and done fast \u2013 food prices will soar,\" he said in a recent statement. In the 2008 drought it was Cuba's Fidel Castro leading the charge against America's use of food for fuel.</p> <p>Johnson says this summer is an \"aberration\". In the long run she believes ethanol is a good bet and will mean cheaper fuel for Americans, something that worries them more than small rises in food prices. But the pressures are mounting. Richer consumers in China and other developing nations are eating more corn-fed meat, and the ethanol subsidy isn't going anywhere, especially in an election year when so much is riding on corn-fuelled swing states like Iowa.</p> <p>Even corn farmers seem to have had enough. A recent survey by Farm Futures magazine found farmers planning to cut the land they will set aside for corn next spring. Willie Vogt, editorial director of Farm Progress, which organises the giant show, says the big issue now is what happens next. Last year was tough on livestock farmers. This year is tougher still.

  "<p>A lawyer representing the man who accused a Pakistani Christian girl of blasphemy has said that if she is not convicted, Muslims could \"take the law into their own hands\".</p> <p>Rao Abdur Raheem cited the example of Mumtaz Qadri, the man who last year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/04/punjab-governor-murder-pakistan\" title=\"\">shot dead a politician who had called for reform </a>of the much-abused blasphemy law.</p> <p>The apparent hijacking of the case against Rimsha Masih by organised extremists, including lawyers, could further complicate a bitterly contentious case.</p> <p>The lawyer's comments are likely to further complicate a bitterly contentious case that has caused an international outcry and embarrassed the Pakistani government. It could intimidate the court and would put her life at further risk even if she is freed.</p> <p>The girl, Rimsha Masih, from Mehrabadi, Islamabad, whose family says she is 11, was arrested this month and charged with desecrating the Qur'an after a neighbour, Malik Hammad, claimed that he saw her with burnt pages of the holy text in a bag she was carrying.</p> <p>Her family had hoped that she would be granted bail on Thursday after a medical report this week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/28/pakistan-christian-blasphemy-girl-quran?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">found that she was a minor</a> \u2013 thus eligible for bail \u2013 and had learning difficulties. But those hopes were dashed when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/30/pakistan-girl-blasphemy-rimsha-masih\" title=\"\">Raheem challenged the report</a> and the hearing was postponed.</p> <p>According to Raheem, the medical report on Masih was illegal, as it followed the orders of a civil servant and not the court, and went beyond its remit of determining her age. He accused the government of supporting her and manipulating court proceedings. Speaking outside the Islamabad court after the hearing, Raheem said: \"There are many Mumtaz Qadris in this country \u2026 This [medical] report has been managed by the state, state agencies and the accused.\"</p> <p>The case has caused an international outcry. Later, sitting in his office beneath a large poster of Qadri, Raheem told the Guardian: \"If the court is not allowed to do its work, because the state is helping the accused, then the public has no other option except to take the law into their own hands.\"</p> <p>There is however a glimmer of hope. In this case, for the first time in the case hardline Islamic clerics have cautioned against presuming the guilt of Rimsha Masih. Last night one of Pakistan's most radical mullahs, Ahmed Ludhianvi, head of the banned Sipah-e-Sahaba, which is blamed for hundreds of sectarian killings, told the Guardian: \"There should be a thorough investigation. If she [Masih] didn't do it, she should be freed. If she is mentally disturbed, scholars should consider what should be done. Islam does not allow anyone to be punished instantaneously.\"</p> <p>Last year, many lawyers rallied around Qadri, who killed Punjab governor Salman Taseer, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/05/pakistan-religious-organisations-salman-taseer\" title=\"\">showering him with rose petals when he appeared in court</a>.</p> <p>Raheem said he had taken on the case for free because he was convinced that Masih should be punished. \"This girl is guilty. If the state overrides the court, then God will get a person to do the job,\" he said.</p> <p>However, it seems unclear why the accuser suspected Masih and how he saw inside the bag that she was apparently carrying. It is also unclear whether any burnt pages were actually from the Qur'an.</p> <p>Following Raheem's objections to the medical report, the court has asked the authorities for clarification and will hear the case again on Saturday, when bail for the girl could again be considered.</p> <p>Blasphemy allegations are often made on the flimsiest of evidence but enraged mobs pressure the police into registering cases. In court, the alleged act of blasphemy cannot even be repeated, as that would be an act of blasphemy in itself, so verdicts are reached in the absence of the main piece of evidence.</p> <p>Earlier this year, a mentally disturbed Muslim man in Bahawalpur, a city in the middle of the country, was accused of blasphemy and arrested. After a crowd of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18713545\" title=\"\">up to 2,000 stormed the police station </a>and dragged him out, he was beaten and burned alive. In 2009, a mob attacked an area where Christians lived in Gojra, a town in Punjab province, burning at least eight people to death.</p> <p>The fate of the Christians at Gojra hangs heavily over Masih's own community. They fled en masse after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/19/pakistan-christian-tensions-quran-burning-allegations\" title=\"\">Rimsha Masih was taken away by police from her home. </a>Now, two weeks on, many of the Christians have trickled back, but they remain terrified.</p> <p>One Christian, Arif Masih, returned to his house in Mehrabadi after nine days to find it looted. \"People are so afraid, they cannot sleep at night,\" he said. \"We just want to leave, we want to be given somewhere else to live,\" said Masih.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 31 August 2012 to correct editing mistakes throughout.</p>",
  "<p><em>Are there any particular laptops that I could recommend to my students? (If anyone wants to apply, I'm teaching an <a href=\"http://www.beds.ac.uk/howtoapply/courses/postgraduate/international-journalism\">MA in international journalism</a> at the University of Bedfordshire, starting in October.) They're not rich so I can't recommend anything too expensive.</em></p> <p><em>I read your recent article on \u00a3350 laptops. I'm not a Dell partisan, but I'd like to know your view about the Dell offering in this price range. The Inspiron 15 is available for \u00a3349 with an Intel Core i3-2350M processor, 3GB RAM, 320GB HD, and Office Starter. Too little RAM?</em><br><strong>David Brake</strong><br><br>I recommended three \u00a3350 laptops in an article in the Guardian's Money section on Saturday (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/aug/24/cheap-computer-laptop\">The best value laptops for less than \u00a3350</a>), and I think this is a good target price for a low-end machine.</p> <p>Most of these \"value laptops\" have much the same specification nowadays. You get a 15.6in, 1366 x 768-pixel widescreen, 4GB of memory, 320GB or 500GB hard drive, DVD, and 64-bit Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium. What makes the most difference to the price is the choice of processor. This can take the same laptop from less than \u00a3300 with an AMD C-50 to more than \u00a3500 with the latest Ivy Bridge version of Intel's Core i5.</p> <p>The processor makes a huge difference to the performance. As I said: \"In the \u00a3300\u2013\u00a3350 range the best you generally get is a Core i3-2330M or 2350M, where the bigger number signifies a faster chip. (The M stands for mobile. Laptop processors use less power and run slower than desktop versions, to reduce heat and give better battery life.) In my view you should not settle for anything less than a Pentium B940, B950 or preferably a B960 processor. I think laptops with Celeron chips are too slow. Cheap AMD chips, such as the C-50, E-240 Fusion and E2-1800 Brazos are even slower than Celerons.\"</p> <p>Bargain prices often indicate low-end or old processors.</p> <p>Most buyers can make their own judgments on things like screen and keyboard quality, the sturdiness of construction, bulk and weight by looking at popular laptops in high-street shops and computer superstores. When it comes to the speed of the processor, Notebook Check's table, <a href=\"http://www.notebookcheck.net/Mobile-Processors-Benchmarklist.2436.0.html\">Comparison of Mobile Processors</a>, provides a good guide.</p> <p>The models I think are most worth a look in this category are the Samsung RV520, Lenovo G570 and G580, and the Asus X54C. Check the original article for details and links.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.dell.com/uk/p/inspiron-15-intel-n5050/fs?cs=ukepp1\">Dell Inspiron 15</a> fits into this category, and prices start at \u00a3299 with a Celeron processor. On Dell's website, a version with a <a href=\"http://configure.euro.dell.com/dellstore/config.aspx?oc=n00n5510&amp;model_id=inspiron-15-intel-n5050&amp;c=uk&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;cs=ukepp1\">Core i3-2370M</a> cost \u00a3399, which took it out of my price range. I didn't see the one you mention, but some Dell machines are sold through retail channels, and bargains can be found.</p> <p>One thing that is attractive is Dell's three-year next-day on-site service. Some years ago, my son took an Inspiron (then more than \u00a31,000) to university, and he used the on-site service both at home and on campus. It was brilliant, though I'd rather he hadn't needed it.</p> <p>Mainstream laptops are great if you use them at home. Ideally, put them on a riser to lift the screen to eye level and plug in a good quality USB or wireless ergonomic keyboard. Unfortunately, they also tend to be big and heavy, and they don't have very good battery life. The Inspiron 15 (N00N5503), for example, weighs 2.37kg. It's no fun lugging one of those around.</p> <p>As a journalist who carries a laptop everywhere, I would go for something with a 13.3in or smaller screen and a weight of 1.5kg or, preferably, less. For some years, my favourite was an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_ThinkPad_240\">IBM ThinkPad 240X</a> with 192MB of memory and a 6GB hard drive (no CD or DVD) running Windows 2000. It weighed 1.3kg, which is MacBook Air territory.</p> <p>Computers have changed in the past dozen years, and so has journalism. Today's multimedia journalists need more powerful laptops that can handle simple photo, audio and video editing tasks, and I note that your course also includes desktop publishing. Programs such as Microsoft Office, Adobe's Creative Suite (including Photoshop) and Lightroom are standard tools of the trade, and most are available at big discounts in student versions.</p> <p>The system of choice for a mobile journalist would therefore be one of the traditional ultraportable ranges (ThinkPad X, Toshiba Port\u00e9g\u00e9), an ultrabook such as the Asus UX32 Zenbook or, of course, an Apple MacBook Air. These machines are easy to carry around, have great battery life, and can handle multimedia with comparative ease. They're ideal for students who can afford to spend around \u00a31,000-\u00a31,200.</p> <p>It is possible to find cheaper ultrabooks. One that I <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/lenovo-ultrabook-u300s-hands-on-4010025782/\">tried and liked</a> was the Lenovo U300s, which Amazon.co.uk is currently selling for <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lenovo-IdeaPad-Laptop-Windows-Premium/dp/B005TPRWYS\">\u00a3599.99</a>, reduced from \u00a3899.99. The spec includes an Intel Core i5-2467M processor and a 128GB solid state drive (SSD). There will be more bargains as this year's Ivy Bridge Core iX chips replace Sandy Bridge versions such as the i5-2467M.</p> <p>The Toshiba Port\u00e9g\u00e9 Z830-10N (search for PT224E-00H00LEN) is another Core i3 Ultrabook that generally goes for around \u00a3600, and consumer-oriented Satellite versions of the 830 can be found for less.</p> <p>A good all-round compromise would be something like the new <a href=\"http://www.dell.com/uk/business/p/vostro-3360/fs\">Vostro Notebook 3360</a>, which Dell describes as an ultraportable. The Vostro 3360 is thin (19mm), relatively light (1.67kg), and offers good battery life (<a href=\"http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/laptops/376057/dell-vostro-3360\">almost 7 hours on PC Pro's light-use test</a>). The base system with a Core i3-2367M processor, 4GB of memory, 320GB (7200RPM) hard drive and 64-bit Windows 7 Professional costs \u00a3478.81 including delivery, which is roughly half the price of an ultrabook. Three years' on-site service costs \u00a375. The next model up supports 3G for about \u00a350 more.</p> <p>If it looks familiar, the Vostro 3360 is heir to last year's V131 and earlier models, though the battery is no longer removable.</p> <p>As a high-volume laptop supplier, Dell offers a number of different ranges, with Inspiron being the value range for consumers, XPS the luxury range, and Alienware the high-end range for gamers. Vostro is the value range for business buyers, with Latitude as the mainstream range and Precision models for high-end mobile workstations. The Vostro 3360 looks more durable than the Inspiron 15 laptops I've seen, and (except for Trend Micro Titanium anti-virus software) Dell's business machines don't come with any of the crapware you often find on consumer PCs.</p> <p>One catch is that Dell UK doesn't offer Vostro laptops via its student discount website at <a href=\"http://www.dell-sci.co.uk/\">dell-sci.co.uk</a>. However, the discounts are not huge (2%, 5% or 8%), so this doesn't matter much. You may be able to get more off by searching for discount vouchers. You may also find that your university has a discount deal with a preferred supplier, but don't expect miracles. The margins on mainstream Windows laptops are perilously thin.</p>",
  "<h2>New trends for the new term</h2> <p>It's been a good few years since I left the world of education, and yet I always get that new term feeling once the last August weekend has passed. The holidays are over, the strange sweets from foreign airports consumed, and we all desperately search for the next thing to look forward to. For makeup fans, the start of term is something that gets them through these post-holiday blues because the new collections are trickling into shops and the trends are there to be studied. So let's take a minute to do some advanced reading and pick three new term trends that might work for us in real life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395424723\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/30/1346324586530/Aquascutum-and-Anna-Sui-006.jpg\" alt=\"Aquascutum and Anna Sui\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Models for Aquascutum and Anna Sui, with looks courtesy of MAC Cosmetics (left) and Max Factor (right) Photograph: MAC/Max Factor</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MAC/Max Factor</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Bold accents</strong><br>Every season I feel like there's some bright colour trend that would only transfer to a handful of teenage fashion students from Central Saint Martins. But this year us ordinary folk could be in luck. Pockets of bold colour were seen either on eyes or lips - not both at the same time, thankfully, and not too crazy, either. Our professor in this subject is Pat McGrath, Global Creative Director for Max Factor. For the Anna Sui models, McGrath created a gorgeous retro flick of purple liner on the upper lid (and also a dot in the middle of the lower but let's make this optional). At Nina Ricci, it was the lips that did the talking with McGrath creating a beautifully deep crimson on fresh faced models. It's a look that's surprisingly easy to wear for all skin tones. It's just a question of finding the right red for you.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395424724\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/30/1346330687441/Fashion-Michael-Kors-Fall-001.jpg\" alt=\"Fashion Michael Kors Fall 2012\" width=\"215\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Kors autumn/winter 2012 Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Vintage English</strong><br>This subject has variations on the main theme depending on who you're listening to. Also known as, 'Healthy Glow' or 'Modern Neutrals', this look is very user-friendly. In fact you may well be rocking the look already without consciously trying. In which case, A* to you. If not, it's really quite simple. Take inspiration from the looks created by Dick Page for the Michael Kors show using Shiseido. The cheeks had a rosy flush, eyes were left almost bare with a slight emphasis on the brow, and lips were given a stained red look. Basically, it's about looking like you've just come in from the cold without actually being out in the cold in the first place. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395424725\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/30/1346325089265/Moschinos-heavy-eyeliner--001.jpg\" alt=\"Moschino's heavy eyeliner look\" width=\"215\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moschino's heavy eyeliner look from autumn/winter 2013 Photograph: Michele Morosi</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michele Morosi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Graphic eyes</strong><br>It's no secret that I'm a massive fan of black eyeliner but I always do the same flicky shape and so it's time for change. Terry Barber, MAC's director of artistry, coined the term 'Arti-tech' for this trend of new shapes for eyeliner. Weird and wonderful lines were drawn on the eyes at Aquascutum, Erdem and Moschino to name just three. They may look a little daunting at first but a bit of practice and we'll all be top of the class at eyeliner control in no time. Our tip from teacher Terry? Apply the eyeliner and then re-shape by removing with cotton wool and eye makeup remover. It's easier than building up line after line.</p> <h2>New launch news</h2> <p>There's a lot of love for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/fashion-blog/2011/nov/14/brief-history-of-nars\">NARS</a> makeup, and as of this weekend, there's going to be a lot more with the launch of a new collection of skincare, <strong>NARSskin</strong>. In sleek white packaging, the products are top quality. My pick of the range is the <strong>Aqua Gel Luminous Mask</strong> which I've been using religiously every night after cleansing. It's already taken the place of my previously beloved night serum/night cream combo. <br><em>Aqua Gel Luminous Mask, \u00a327, <a href=\"http://www.narscosmetics.co.uk/\">narscosmetics.co.uk</a> from September 1st</em></p>",
  "<p>Games that emerge from development hell are rarely dull. You get the true monstrosities \u2013 Duke Nukem Forever, Daikatana, Too Human \u2013 but you also get those flawed gems such as Spore, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and Gran Turismo 5, games that speak of greatness while still baring the scars of mid-cycle calamities and vast engine rebuilds.</p> <p>Then there the unqualified success stories, titles such as Half Life 2 and Resident Evil 4, that manage to overcome nightmarishly protracted and complex back stories to achieve greatness. </p> <p>Somewhere toward that end of the spectrum is Sleeping Dogs, the unexpected summer hit that's keeping Darksiders 2 from the top of the charts. This engaging thriller started out two years ago as Black Lotus, a mature open-world adventure set in Hong Kong and heavily influenced by the city's action movie directors: Ringo Lam, Johnnie To, John Woo.</p> <p>It was an ambitious project for United Front Games, a Vancouver studio that had been formed only a couple of months before by ex-staff from nearby publishers such as EA and Rockstar. But it was a dark, brutal and interesting concept. It had promise.</p> <p>And then came Activision, a tarnished license and, eventually, the threat of cancellation. </p> <p>So how did UFG create such a solid and entertaining gangland romp, despite the chaotic development process? We spoke to the game's senior producer, Jeff O'Connell to find out.<br><br><strong>So, how did Black Lotus become True Crime: Hong Kong? What happened?</strong><br>The first meetings around this game were in the fall of 2007. It was a very small crew at that point; there were about 10 of us in a tiny little office. We met with Activision and back then, they knew they wanted to get back into the urban open-world genre; they had a prototype on the go, but they asked us to come up with a concept \u2013 which we did. And amazingly, that concept was very similar to the game we ended up releasing. </p> <p>But what happened was, they liked the idea, but at the time they wanted to push it more toward the flavour of True Crime \u2013 and obviously they attached the brand to it. We wanted the tone to be more like an HBO cop show. </p> <p><strong>But, I suppose Activision had enjoyed some success with True Crime, which was much more of a Hollywood-style treatment of the genre.<br></strong> Obviously, while those games were enjoyed by a lot of people, we felt our concept was different. Of course, they were both about cops, but we thought that times had changed and that people wanted something else; it felt like the opportunity was there to make a more mature title. </p> <p><strong>Certainly TV was going in that direction at the time.</strong><br>Absolutely. Look at the cop shows that have been successful \u2013 The Wire, The Shield \u2013 every character is ambiguous. Look at the latest James Bond movies, and the way Daniel Craig plays the character \u2013 is he really a good guy? He's sort of a mercenary. That to us was really interesting. And we were fortunate enough in having an actor like Will Yun Lee who could pull off that sort of performance. </p> <p><strong>But you made changes to the feel of the game to fit with True Crime \u2013 and then in February 2011, the game was effectively canned. How did that go down internally? Did you think it was all over?</strong><br>It was a terrible time really. Activision were very respectful in how they went about informing us of the decision; they let go hundreds of their employees that same day, they cancelled Guitar Hero \u2013 you could tell that it wasn't an easy decision to make. But it was rough times for us, we had to downsize our team within a couple of weeks, and you begin to question a lot of things \u2013 we'd been working on the game for three and a half years at that point and you pour your heart and soul into it.</p> <p>But within a couple of weeks we heard that Square had played the game and were interested in it and they wanted to speak to us \u2013 it was a ray of hope. We talked to them on the phone, they came to Vancouver and met with us. Right away it felt like a very different relationship to the one we had with Activision. Their producers really were old-skool gamers; they'd been working in games since the eighties, as had many staff in our studio. So right away there was a personal connection and they got what we wanted to do with the game. And throughout the development we benefitted form their experience working on titles like Just Cause 2. We just clicked. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395540098\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346333846574/Sleeping-Dogs-005.jpg\" alt=\"Sleeping Dogs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleeping Dogs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>So they really understood the dynamics of open-world game design?</strong><br>Yes. They didn't feel there was any need to make everything obvious right away; an open-world game is one that unfolds over 30 hours \u2013 you don't have to set it all up in the first sixty minutes, you don't have to have a singular motivation \u2013 the characters can develop.</p> <p>I think the biggest change was in the overall tone of the story, the presentation of the game flow, how the game ramps up. We start with action, certainly, but we hold your hand a little to get you into the mechanics \u2013 there are a lot of mechanics! Previously, we were pushed to go for high octane action upfront which we think hurts the game, because it's annoying when that's taken away from you. </p> <p><strong>And it seems like you were able to make changes to the design right through until the end?</strong><br>Yeah, open-world development is challenging and there were things even late in development, with a few weeks to go, that we looked at and said, \"We need to up that system!\" Things come together very late \u2013 it's like a giant jigsaw puzzle and you kind of only see it in its entirety with a few weeks to go. </p> <p><strong>So what were some of the key gameplay changes you made to the game, after its reformation as Sleeping Dogs?</strong><br>Well, very late, we looked at the UI of the upgrade system: how it was laid out, how you were made aware of upgrades, how you used the upgrades menu, how you discovered what you did and didn't have, encouraging you to spend points and accompanying that process with appropriate UI and audio moments.</p> <p>That sort of stuff was really overhauled late in production, not because were unhappy with it, but because it was a big part of the game and we felt it was under-realised. The other thing was the lock boxes hidden around the world. Originally, most had cash in them, not weapons or clothes, so there was less surprise and satisfaction \u2013 it was a minor change but it altered the way people played the game. </p> <p><strong>Developing a good upgrade UI and a decent loot system are RPG elements \u2013 it's interesting those should have been altered after the creator of Final Fantasy became your publisher!</strong><br>(Laughs) Yes, that's true! I think that's the great thing about working with Square. Producer Chris Dillon and Alastair Cornish, the design lead \u2013 they really focused on the little things, the game systems \u2013 they were constantly playing and given us feedback. Alastair spent a lot of time talking to our design director, Mike Skupa, who's ex-Rockstar and lead designer on Bully. </p> <p>It's interesting as an aside \u2013 everyone says the combat system is like Batman, but if you think back to Bully that was the genesis of this kind of open-world combat. That's really where the impetus came from. But the loot system was Mike and Alistair talking and finding ways to make the feedback loop more obvious and compelling to the player, more enticing, more fun. And if we were to do a sequel, which we'd like to do, we'll push that RPG aspect of the game even further. </p> <p><strong>It's definitely the strength of the game systems, the mechanics of the game, that people are responding too, isn't it?</strong><br>Open-world games have a lot of stuff in them \u2013 in Sleeping Dogs, between the main missions and all the collectibles and everything else, there are around 300 things to do; there are hours of cut-scenes and it's a big game world. We've got all these mechanics that we spent time on. As a developer, you can get lost in all that stuff and just put it out there.</p> <p>But working with Square and having the extra time allowed us to look at the feedback loops and say, there's an opportunity that's under realised here \u2013 we have the basics, but it's not as good as it could be. I think the reason the systems are there in the first place is that Mike, our design director, spent a lot of time looking at social and mobile gaming and saw that the feedback loop is really what makes those games entertaining and playable \u2013 it's even the same with titles like Starcraft and Diablo. And looking to the future, with the new consoles coming, developers really need to be thinking about the feedback loop \u2013 especially for open-world games. That's where the addiction element comes in \u2013 it's not just about twitch anymore, it seems. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395540099\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346333640686/Sleeping-Dogs-003.jpg\" alt=\"Sleeping Dogs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleeping Dogs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>So is there a secret to building compelling feedback loops within action adventure game designs?</strong><br>The big picture is, if you break down the core mechanics - fighting, shooting, driving \u2013 we brought in expert designers and gameplay engineers who had worked on those areas. We had Mike from Bully \u2013 and a lot of the other engineers also worked on that game. Our driving designer was from Need For Speed; that's where the pick-up-and-play driving and the car tuning came from. And for shooting we have guys from Max Payne, Scarface\u2026 we really tried to assemble a team that could deliver best-in-class mechanics. We were fortunate that the personalities clicked - if that hadn't happened we would have been in trouble! </p> <p>I'd love to say there's a secret recipe, but these guys just worked their butts off. I think they did that because, when the game was cancelled, they took it personally \u2013 we'd never had a project axed before. We knew the game was good \u2013 these guys felt they had to prove themselves to their peers in the industry, to their families... and they went the extra mile. </p> <p><strong>The game is very big on environmental combat moves \u2013 being able to smash opponents into walls and other scenic objects. That could have been a gimmick, but here it really seems to ground you and connect you with the surroundings.</strong><br>That was something we knew would be critical for us. We had a movie clip that provided the goal of our fighting mechanic \u2013 it was from a Tony Jaa movie called the Protector. The lead character is fighting his way up a circular staircase around the parameter of a large room, and it's all done in one shot so it feels like an action game.</p> <p>But the point is, in this sequence, he uses everything \u2013 railings, vases, sinks, televisions \u2013 any stuff in the environment. And when we started to go deeper and really look at Hong Kong cinema, Jet Li does the same thing, so does Jackie Chan \u2013 look at Police Story, that fight in the mall, he's using clothing rails, he's using escalators. It's just such a signature of Hong Kong action cinema, we felt we had to do it. And again if a sequel happens, I'd love to push that ever further. </p> <p><strong>Ultimately, what has Sleeping Dogs taught you about game development?</strong><br>We all learned that the industry has changed. When we started, a couple of months into UFG's operation, the iPhone came out, and later the iPad, and Facebook had risen in prominence. How gamers entertain themselves \u2013 that whole model has changed. It forces publishers to be more careful with how they develop games and spend their money. Developers of triple A titles have to be on their A game all the time \u2013 every single member of the team needs to realise what's at stake. There are no free launches any more \u2013 if there ever were. </p> <p><strong>Do you think, as we enter the next console generation that it's going to become almost impossible for publishers to bet on original IPs from small studios? The development costs are going to rise enormously.</strong><br>There aren't as many opportunities. And for studios who do get the opportunity, there's more pressure than there ever has been. The end of original IP would be incredibly depressing, but look at Watch Dogs, that's an exciting new property \u2013 it has captured the imagination of gamers. Every time there's a new generation of consoles the processing power opens up new opportunities for gameplay. I think we'll see new franchises spawn, some designer somewhere will be inspired in a new way.</p> <p><strong>And will we see a Sleeping Dogs 2 on the next-gen hardware?</strong><br>There has been such a great response to the game. We feel like there are more stories to tell and we think from a mechanics point of view the next generation consoles present possibilities that will work really well for us. We're optimistic, that's for certain.</p>",

  "<p>Few of the Tory fallen at the 1997 general election lost more sadly than Rhodes Boyson. The most dedicated and professional of constituency MPs was ejected from the conventionally safe seat of Brent North, north-west London, with a swing of 18.8%. In fact, as neighbouring scores indicated, there was nothing personal about it. Fears that the partial closing of Edgware general hospital would become complete produced local fury and the Conservatives' terrible election results.</p> <p>To a casual observer, Boyson, who has died aged 87, had been a reactionary favouring the death penalty and not favouring homosexuals. This was literally true, and was accentuated by a conscious dressing for the part of a Dickensian heavy, with waistcoats and whiskers and a grumbling style of address which suggested a pedagogue lightly balancing a supple, therapeutic rattan cane.</p> <p>But Boyson was much more than this. A brilliantly successful headteacher with high academic credentials from four universities \u2013 \"proper universities\" he would have called them \u2013 Cardiff, Manchester, LSE and Cambridge, he was an early critic of educational standards whose extreme views of 1970 became Conservative practice in the late 80s and were largely adopted by Labour subsequently. The thunder he liked to roll hid a large vein of kindness, and as the Tory party moved to the right, he came to look like a crypto-moderate, certainly a force for stability.</p> <p>Boyson was born in Haslingden, Lancashire, the son of William and Bertha Boyson. His father was a Labour alderman cotton-spinner and conscientious objector. After having sat as a Labour councillor (1957-61), Rhodes became a Tory, not out of reaction to his father, but as an almost pre-emptive rejection of the 60s. A Methodist, he had most of the old nonconformist assumptions \u2013 belief in work and sexual austerity \u2013 to which a spell in the Royal Navy had added a nationalism and military sympathy not associated with the chapel. The cliche runs \"to the right of Genghis Khan\": Boyson, much more interestingly, stood rightwards of John Bright, the 19th-century Liberal MP and strong anti-Corn Law advocate of free trade.</p> <p>As an educationist, Boyson was alienated by that 60s shift from hard subjects to soft, examinations to no examinations, grammar and spelling to not grammar and spelling. Having gone on from Haslingden grammar school to obtain an MA from Manchester and a PhD from the LSE, with a thesis on the Corn Laws, and having, over 24 years, first taught, then taken three headships, concluding at Highbury Grove, Islington, north London (1967-74), he was a convinced traditionalist with exam results used to validate tradition.</p> <p>The success of Highbury Grove, marked in a book succinctly titled Oversubscribed (1974), expressed in action Boyson's antipathy to the experimental, child-centred schooling of the 60s. Ironically, Margaret Thatcher, with a career to make under Ted Heath, did more in the way of liquidating grammar schools than anyone including the policy's deviser, Anthony Crosland. Boyson disliked compulsory comprehensives \u2013 \"a dangerous neurotic desire for change\" \u2013 but was determined to make his comprehensive work, and on any fair count he did.</p> <p>Boyson, with characteristic cussedness, also managed to play the media. Television at the time tended to favour fashionably leftwards thinking, and Boyson doubtless seemed a good candidate to be a butt for it. Instead, as a regular advocate of a coherent hard line on education, he was so memorable and effective as to become a figure of national recognition.</p> <p>The heavily stressed Lancashire accent and downright manner marked him off as a \"character\". But he was also winning arguments, and, with the publication of the first Black Papers, joined a formidable group with John Marks, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/sep/10/guardianobituaries.obituaries\">AE (Tony) Dyson</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/28/culture.obituaries\">CB (Brian) Cox</a>, fighting a battle for which the Conservative party lacked the nerve or conviction.</p> <p>In fairness, Boyson, with his working-class roots and own scholastic achievements, truly cared for good education and knew exactly what he was talking about. But he would find the Tory party opportunistic and indifferent to rigour and standards.</p> <p>He sat on Waltham Forest council from 1968, and fought the hopeless Eccles constituency, in Lancashire, in 1970. Three years later he was chosen for the new Brent North seat and entered parliament at the age of 48, in the February 1974 election that Edward Heath's Conservative government lost.</p> <p>When Thatcher led the Tories back to power in 1979, Boyson was at an age at which middle-ranking ministers going no higher are usually discarded. Instead, Boyson began an eight-year career via junior office at education (1979-83) to minister at social security (1983-84), Northern Ireland (1984-86) and local government (1986-87).</p> <p>His time on the frontbench had got off to an ill-fated start. As deputy education spokesman (1976-79), it seemed he was the victim either of a delicate sense of humour or, since this was Thatcher, total imperception, and was harnessed with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/05/lord-st-john-of-fawsley\" title=\"Lord St John of Fawsley obituary\">Norman St John-Stevas</a>, later Lord St John of Fawsley, who died earlier this year. There was a beautiful symmetry in their relationship \u2013 intelligent, cultivated men of contrasting types, they hated one another. Whereas Boyson was plain, blunt, spade-fancying north of England, puritan and solid with a rhetorical flourish, Stevas was mostly the opposite, though himself with a liking for flourishes that could obscure the serious with the frivolous.</p> <p>More to the point, because Stevas accepted the Crosland line, little changed, and Boyson's time as parliamentary undersecretary was frustrating and a disappointment. So was Thatcher, for whom he had been an early fugleman.</p> <p>She, having accepted comprehensives as part of Heath's general falling in with Labour thinking, contented herself largely with making the right noises on education. The great push for the core curriculum and a critical assessment of schools and teachers came towards the end of her time in office, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/mar/25/education.schools\">Kenneth Baker's Education Reform Act</a> of 1988, and continued under the less rightwing John Major.</p> <p>Boyson was never trusted with the job he coveted \u2013 radical restorer of the education system. Partly this was because Thatcher was not sufficiently interested in the subject to want early, vigorous solutions. The voucher scheme which he had ardently favoured was killed off in 1983.</p> <p>He saw his Northern Ireland job as a dumping ground. But he had been his own worst enemy. A fine conversational debater on TV or in symposiums, he was never effective in the Commons, tending to be slightly disorganised, giving clumsy speeches delivered without impact.</p> <p>Generally, his rightwingness was of the wholesome kind, and he supported a ban on contracting companies with any discriminatory employment practice. As member for a racially mixed constituency, he made himself known and helpful to all communities.</p> <p>On the backbenches after 1987, the year in which he was knighted, he was a dangerous enemy, as John Moore discovered when he was secretary of state for social services. The fall of Moore, once a Tory crown prince, began when the proposed rejig of social security ran up against a Boyson-led group which saw it penalising constituents with some savings.</p> <p>But then Boyson looked sedulously after his constituents. Steady Labour voters were impressed, though not converted, to get congratulations on a child's GCSE results through the door within days of them appearing. Boyson's actual downfall was the product of a policy he had resisted: the closing down of parts of Edgware general hospital, something delightful to the planners and detestable to the voters of Brent and Harrow.</p> <p>In 1994, he appeared on Have I Got News for You and seemed not to appreciate the lighthearted nature of the programme. Still undaunted by the notion of satire, three years later he took part in Chris Morris's Brass Eye, and was also an early interviewee of Ali G.</p> <p>Boyson was more intelligent than he was shrewd, and, reactionary grumbles aside, he was a kind, companionable man, and excellent company.</p> <p>He married Violet Burletson in 1946, and they had two daughters. After their divorce in 1971, he married Florette MacFarlane, a teacher.</p> <p>\u2022 Rhodes Boyson, teacher and politician, born 11 May 1925; died 28&#xa0;August 2012</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 31 August 2012.

They face removal from the UK unless they can find somewhere to study within 60 days.</p> <p>\"This sends a fear through many universities in a way that I think is going to be detrimental to their confidence as higher education institutions but also the projection of brand UK abroad,\" he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Responses from other universities included \"commiseration, worry, anger, but also a feeling of probably, 'well thank God it wasn't us this time',\" Gillies said. \"I think that shows the nervousness that many in the sector have, especially at a time when clearly government policy is changing but also when the <a href=\"http:///www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Border Agency (UKBA)</a> guidelines have been changing very rapidly.\"</p> <p>Gillies has warned that the future of the 30,000-student university is at risk. Five hundred private higher education colleges have already lost their power to recruit abroad following crackdowns on bogus students.</p> <p>The immigration minister, Damian Green, said London Met had displayed a \"serious systemic failure\" to know whether its students had the right to be in the UK in the first place. He denied making the university a political football over immigration controls and insisted such action would not be replicated across the university sector.</p> <p>The UK's lucrative higher education business in international students involves about 300,000 students and is worth an estimated \u00a35bn a year to the economy.</p> <p>Green, speaking on the BBC's Today programme, said people entering Britain as students but seeking work exploited \"one of the biggest loopholes in the immigration system\".</p> <p>UKBA audits of London Met found that more than a quarter of cases sampled had no leave to remain in Britain. There was also no proof that \"a significant proportion\" of international students had satisfactory English. In more than half of cases, the university did not know whether students were turning up to lectures or not.</p> <p>Green said \"any of these three breaches would be serious\" and that it was important to ensure \"not just private colleges but universities obey the law\".</p> <p>\"What we found here is a serious systemic failure where it appears that the university doesn't have the capacity to be a proper sponsor [of international students] and to have confidence that the students have the right to be here in the first place,\" Green said.</p> <p>University funders and leaders said the first priority was to sort out the future of genuine students. It is understood the <a href=\"http://www.hefce.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Higher Education Funding Council for England</a> and London Met have been in talks for weeks over the crisis, which began when the UKBA suspended the university's right to be a \"highly trusted sponsor\" of students on 16 July.</p> <p>Gillies said the decision, which was taken because of what he called a \"small minority\" among international students not having \"accurate documentation to remain in the UK\", will leave a \u00a330m hole in London Met's finances \u2013 nearly a fifth of its annual budget. The crisis had already cost \"way over\" \u00a310m. Gillies said it would also cost the wider London economy \u00a375m.</p> <p>Gillies said 20-30 universities were already offering to help resettle students. \"It's hard to think of a time that could have been worse [for this decision] because the suspension has done such damage already to our requirement for this coming year.\"</p> <p>Efforts to find alternative places for affected students could prove difficult \u2013 even if they have appropriate visas. Most universities will have finalised their international student numbers for the new academic year.</p> <p>The university may also face legal action from students who have paid up to \u00a313,500 a year for uncompleted courses.</p> <p>London Met will not be able to take extra students from Britain and the EU to make up the numbers and shore up its finances either. In England, for example, due to the need to control the costs of student loans, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills sets a limit on the number of home and EU students that can be recruited. Given the high demand from home students, universities recruit right up to that limit, and then determine the number of places available to non-EU international students.</p> <p>Prof Eric Thomas, the president of Universities UK, said the organisation was committed to eliminating any abuse of the student visa system, but that there were alternative ways of addressing UKBA's concerns and revocation of a university's licence should only be a decision of last resort. \"We will be working with UKBA to ensure that compliance issues can be addressed in a more constructive way in the future,\" Thomas said.</p> <p>Syed Rumman, vice-president for education for London Met's student union, accused the government of \"chucking students' lives into the bin\". Nine of the 10 union officers, including all five sabbatical officers, are international students, and like others face administrative removal in 60 days if they do not find other higher education institutions to offer them a place.</p> <p>Liam Burns, president of the National Union of Students, said: \"It is disgusting that international students continue to be used as a political football by politicians who seem either incapable of understanding, or are simply uncaring about, the impact of their decisions on individuals, universities and the UK economy.</p> <p>\"This decision will create panic and potential heartbreak for students not just at London Met but also all around the country.\"</p> <p>Geoffrey Alderman of the Association of Independent Higher Education Providers said: \"No one is gloating over this. It is sending shockwaves through the university sector but if half the concern had been shown at the draconian action of the UK Border Agency against non-taxpayer-funded higher education, the sympathy would be much greater.</p> <p>\"A lot of bogus institutions had to be cleared out of the system but in the course of this the baby has been thrown out with the bathwater.\"</p> <p>London Met has set up a helpline for worried students \u2013 +44 (0) 20 7133 4141 \u2013 and the UKBA has <a href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/studying/adult-students/changes/\" title=\"\">posted advice for students online</a>.</p>",

John McCain took the stage to lament the wars he didn't get to start after losing the 2008 presidential election, fervently hoping Mitt Romney will make up for lost time. Republicans you have never heard of enjoyed their 15 minutes of fame, though it often seemed much longer.</p> <p>In the early going, the only positive moments were an artfully done (even if foreign policy-free) video tribute to Ron Paul, a cautious but well-received address by his son Rand Paul, and George HW Bush doing an impression of <a href=\"http://www.danacarvey.net/\">Dana Carvey</a> doing an impression of him. (If you're curious, the 41st president nailed it.)</p> <p>But as the program moved toward prime time, the speakers picked up the pace. Mike Huckabee started slow, as if Romney's censors had edited out the former Arkansas governor's charm. But his attack on the Obama administration's HHS contraceptive mandate was powerful, and his attempt to rally evangelicals behind a Mormon and a Catholic was sincere. Condoleezza Rice gave one of the strongest speeches of the convention. Susana Martinez, the first-term governor of New Mexico, was likeable, down-to-earth, and impressive.</p> <p>Paul Ryan, nevertheless, remained the star of the show. Ryan is still honing his skills as a big event speaker and attack dog, but he did a good job delivering some of the most effective and specific anti-Obama barbs heard yet in Tampa.</p> <p>\"College grads shouldn't have to live out their 20s in childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters,\" he zinged. \"There is no shortage of words from the White House. What is missing is leadership from the White House,\" was another good Ryan line. Finally, on Barack Obama's tendency to blame his predecessors: \"The man assumed office nearly four years ago. Isn't it time he assumed responsibility?\"</p> <p>You could quibble with some facts: the GM plant Ryan mentioned actually closed down before Obama took office, though Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has pointed out that the president said he would save it. The line itself serves as a reminder that Ryan himself voted for the auto bailout. But overall, Ryan did what he needed to: he galvanized the conservative base without frightening swing voters, all while amplifying the ticket's attack on Obama's economic policies.</p> <p>The biggest blunder of the night was spending so much time reliving George W Bush's presidency. Bush himself appeared in an innocuous video. McCain channeled Bush on steroids. And for all Rice's rhetorical talent, she was essentially promoting warmed-over Bushism and a revisionist take on the 43rd president's \"forward strategy of freedom\", which didn't grapple with the general failure of his foreign policy in the Middle East.</p> <p>Romney and Ryan should want to get clear of Bush.</p> <p><em>James Antle is editor of the Daily Caller News Foundation</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/michael-cohen\">Michael Cohen</a>: 'Ryan's speech was a good example of just how far the GOP has strayed from the truth'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395422721\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2011/8/6/1312655160523/Michael-Cohen-003.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Cohen\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Cohen Photograph: Observer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Listening to Paul Ryan's vice-presidential speech this evening, I think I came within an inch of having a full-blown aneurysm. Never have I heard a major political speech so brazenly and stunningly dishonest. Others will want to talk about Ryan's strong performance and the wild crowd reaction from the assembled GOP delegates, but I'll just spend a few minutes chronicling his cavalcade of lies.</p> <p>Ryan began with a doozy: implicitly blaming Obama for the closing of a General Motors plant in his town of Janesville, Wisconsin. First, that plant was closed when George W Bush was still president. (In fact, here's a <a href=\"http://paulryan.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=200270\">press release</a> from Ryan decrying the closure in June 2008, six months before Obama took office.) So, in a sense, Ryan was complaining that Obama didn't re-open it \u2013 a fairly amazing charge from a candidate and a party that have spent the last two days <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/29/they-built-that-republicans-big-lie\">decrying the role of government in the private sector</a>. It's an even more amazing when you consider that Ryan's running-mate opposed the auto bailout and even penned an op-ed titled \"Let Detroit Go Bankrupt.\"</p> <p>Ryan then quickly pivoted to the stimulus, which he described as \"a case of political patronage, corporate welfare, and cronyism at their worst \u2026 What did the taxpayers get out of the Obama stimulus? More debt. That money wasn't just spent and wasted \u2013 it was borrowed, spent, and wasted.\"</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/27/why-obama-should-run-success-stimulus\">I wrote about a few days ago here</a>, what the stimulus did provide taxpayers with was 2.5m jobs and an economic boost out of the worst downturn since the Great Depression. This is not to mention all the long-term investments in healthcare, transportation, infrastructure and energy innovation. To argue that the stimulus was <em>wasted</em> is just a breathtaking bit of dishonesty.</p> <p>Then came Ryan's attack on Medicare. He lied about Obama taking money out of the program to pay for Obamacare. He lied about the fact that <em>his</em> budget has the exact same $716bn in cuts for which he attacked Obama. He vowed to protect and strengthen Medicare and honor its promise \u2013 even though his budget would end Medicare's federal guarantee and turn government-supported seniors' healthcare into a voucher program.</p> <p>And perhaps most amazingly, Ryan criticized Obama for creating a bipartisan debt commission and ignoring its recommendations \u2013 recommendations that Ryan voted against <em>as a member of the commission</em>.</p> <p>I could go on. The GOP has done more than create an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/29/they-built-that-republicans-big-lie\">alternate reality</a>; they have built it on a host of political lies, misstatements and untruths. Ryan's speech was a good example of just how far the GOP has strayed from the truth \u2013 and of how debased our political discourse has become.</p> <p><em>Michael Cohen is a US political columnist for the Observer and Guardian</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jim-geraghty\">Jim Geraghty</a>: 'The bar is set extremely high for Romney this Thursday night'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395422723\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/11/1326298456752/jimgeraghty_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Geraghty\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It was a strangely imbalanced night in terms of quality: the early speakers were barely noticed by the conventioneers \u2013 even John McCain, who had some strong critiques of Obama's foreign policy \u2013 and worsened with a speech by near-veep Senator Rob Portman of Ohio (utterly forgettable) and other near-veep Tim Pawlenty (a seemingly endless stream of bad jokes, landing with one THUD after another). About halfway into Governor Mike Huckabee's remarks, it looked like the evening would be a cavalcade of bad-to-mediocre speeches, wondering if we needed even a third night to this abbreviated convention.</p> <p>And then Huckabee got better, with some funny lines and some warm lines \u2013 best was, \"I care less about where Mitt Romney goes to church than where he's going to take this country.\" But the unexpected grand slam was Condi Rice, who at first appeared to be speaking to check a few boxes: foreign policy speech, check; acknowledgement of the Bush administration, check. Instead, Rice offered perhaps the best speech on the country's problems since Lehman collapsed in late 2008, an acknowledgement that the country had stumbled badly and been bruised but was more than capable of picking itself back up and returning to greatness. It was a speech with vision, and the best of the convention.</p> <p>So, the bar was set high for Paul Ryan; yet he cleared it \u2013 with a distinctly different, personable, more intimate style. He started out shaky, but watchers observed that the turning point was discussing his mother \u2013 and then he seemed to relax, and recognize that he knew the story he wanted to tell. Some funny lines will stay with us \u2013 the fading Obama poster on the unemployed grad's childhood bedroom wall \u2013 and I suspect all of the \"granny-killing extremist\" charges are going to have a much tougher time sticking, because Ryan seems so normal: even-keeled and warm and pleasant.</p> <p>Wednesday night left two thoughts: one, the bar is set extremely high for Romney this Thursday night (remember, he's being introduced by Senator Marco Rubio, another one of the GOP's best speakers); and then \u2026 how do Democrats respond to this? Can they go negative and focus on tax returns and contraception and some Seamus jokes after the Republican message has been so focused, realistic, optimistic and bold?</p> <p><em>Jim Geraghty is a contributing editor to the National Review</em></p>",
  "<p>An Asian hacker group dubbed \"Nitro\", because its previous targets include chemicals manufacturing companies, was behind the first attacks to exploit a flaw in Oracle's Java software, says the security company Symantec.</p> <p>Although little is known about the group, it is thought that they did not discover the flaw themselves but may have bought it from a commercial group that specialises in selling details about \"zero-day\" flaws in software that can be used to penetrate commercial or government systems, even when they have the most up-to-date cybersecurity in place.</p> <p>\"We can confirm that some of the attackers behind this latest round of attacks are actually the Nitro gang,\" Symantec says.</p> <p>Orla Cox, senior manager for security response, told the Guardian that the gang had first been spotted online in October 2011, using a command server located in Singapore that was used to control the siphoning of information from 29 US, UK and Bangladesh-based chemical manufacturing companies, many listed on the stock market. She declined to name them, citing customer confidentiality.</p> <p>The latest attacks, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/29/java-exploit-security-malware-flaw\" title=\"\">which have led to widespread advice that users should disable Java on their browsers</a>, were spotted last week.</p> <p>But Cox said that new evidence collected by Symantec indicated that the Nitro group was sending out targeted emails, again to chemicals companies, since 22 August \u2013 before the vulnerability was spotted by security researchers.</p> <p>The emails contained a link which, if clicked, would take unsuspecting users to websites. Those then exploited the flaw in Java to load malware on their machine and leave it open to being surreptitiously controlled, so that information on it or its network could be siphoned to the gang.</p> <p>\"They haven't used a zero-day attack before, which indicates that they don't as a group have that expertise,\" Cox said.</p> <p>She said that suggests that they acquired it commercially rather than discovering it themselves.</p> <p>Zero-day flaws are a burgeoning commercial field in the underground hacker economy where some gangs work to order for commercial or government clients which want to break into systems.</p> <p>Discovering them can take a long time and special expertise; deploying them tends to require much less skill.</p> <p>Symantec said it could not identify the Nitro gang's location, as the Singaporean command computer could be controlled from anywhere in the world.</p> <p>But it seemed likely, said Cox, that the gang is based somewhere in the region.</p>",
  "<p>It is always good sport to tweak the noses of American religious fundamentalists, particularly at election time, and you can never say they don't need tweaking, as the revelation that some of Louisiana's schools are to benefit from remarkable textbooks indicates.</p> <p>Under a voucher system introduced by the state's governor Bobby Jindal \u2013 a rising star of the Republican party \u2013 pupils attending 119 schools in the state, many of them run by the religious right, will be reading <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2012/07/photos-evangelical-curricula-louisiana-tax-dollars\" title=\"\">textbooks which tell them that dinosaurs co-existed with humans</a>, slaves did not have it so bad and the Ku Klux Klan had some good points. Oh, and that Mark Twain was hopeless and Emily Dickinson, who spent much of her life shut up in her house in Amherst writing poetry, was presumptuous and disrespectful \u2013 both of them because they apparently had doubts about the beneficence of the Almighty.</p> <p>These are from textbooks issued over the past few years by Bob Jones University in South Carolina, a bastion of segregationism and racial discrimination for decades, until it found it might lose its charitable status. It is more than a slight irony that this has come from a governor with an ethnic Indian background, who was a Rhodes scholar not so long ago at New College, Oxford, academic home of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/jun/12/richard-dawkins-evolution-new-classics\" title=\"\">Richard Dawkins</a> \u2013 the prof's head must be spinning that an alumnus is sanctioning science teaching that the Earth is only 6,000 years old in schools educating some of the most disadvantaged children in the US.</p> <p>Walking with dinosaurs is bad enough, but what is particularly egregious is the shameless rewriting of history that is going on in some parts of the religious right. The Tea Partiers with their tricorn hats and fifes and drums propel a mythic past of the sort many nations comfort themselves with, but the Bob Jones textbooks with their assertions that \"the majority of slave holders treated their slaves well\" and the KKK \"tried to be a means of reform, fighting the decline in morality\" are not only absurdly, demonstrably wrong-headed, but take distortion to an entirely new level. Such tropes are fading even in the South, but it is not so many years ago that an elderly white woman in Natchez, Mississippi gravely informed me that of course, in the olden days, they treated slaves well \"because, after all, they were our property\".</p> <p>More insidious still because of their veneer of scholarship is the work of the conservative historian David Barton, who tries to wrestle the nation's history into a Christian template that it just does not fit. His latest effort, Jefferson Lies, which attempts in the face of copious evidence to the contrary, to tug the Founding Father into the evangelical Christian tradition, was last month <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/us-news-blog/2012/aug/13/book-thomas-jefferson-complaints-inaccuracies\" title=\"\">withdrawn from publication</a> after being described as the least credible history book in print.</p> <p>The surprising thing is that the publisher Thomas Nelson, which said it had \"lost confidence\" in the work, did not check Barton's track record earlier for he has quite \u2013 ahem \u2013 a history of that sort of thing. It was he who seemingly discovered a document by James Madison insisting that American institutions were founded on the Ten Commandments. Unfortunately the University of Virginia, which owns Madison's papers can find the fourth president saying no such thing, ever.</p> <p>An especially ingenious effort is Barton's assertion that the delegates to the Constitutional convention in 1787 solved their deadlock by praying at Benjamin Franklin's suggestion: \"While neglecting God, their efforts had been characterised by frustration and selfishness\u2026 only after returning God to their deliberations were they effective in their efforts to frame a new government.\"</p> <p>Actually, what happened was that Franklin did indeed suggest praying, but the other delegates all opposed it, not least on the grounds that there was no money to pay a chaplain. Franklin himself wrote: \"The convention except for three or four persons, thought prayers unnecessary.\"</p> <p>That does not stop pictures by zealous modern artists, showing the convention on their knees, bathed in divine light, from gracing the walls of Christian right institutions such as Patrick Henry College near Washington, which prides itself on placing its students as interns with Republican congressmen. One even made it to be an adviser to the Bush administration in Iraq.</p> <p>What makes this important is precisely that such falseness informs and is taken up by the Republican right to construct an image of the US and its constitution in its own likeness. Barton's work has been praised by the likes of Newt Gingrich and Mike Huckabee and notions like his insinuate themselves into the thinking of supreme court justices such as Antonin Scalia with their interesting interpretation of the constitution based on the founders' supposed original intent. Scalia says: \"I look at a text. I take my best shot at getting the fairest meaning \u2026 understanding what it meant at the time it was adopted.\" This has implications for the definition of what the founding fathers understood by phrases such as cruel and unusual punishment.</p> <p>Perhaps we should not be surprised that Louisiana school pupils may soon be taught that the hardships of the Great Depression were exaggerated propaganda, or that the laws of mathematics are a creation of God. After all, it's only 88 years since the legislators of Tennessee decided to outlaw the state's own biology textbook because it taught the theory of evolution and they didn't want their children getting the wrong ideas.</p>",

Emphasis is on the \"man\": this year, as in every single Paralympic Games that India has contested since 1968, there is not one woman in the team.</p> <p>\"It was a disappointment,\" admitted Malik, 41, of discovering that despite having regularly thrown beyond the qualifying distance for the B level of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/interactive/2012/aug/29/paralympics-2012-guide-to-classifications\" title=\"\">the F53 category</a> in the javelin, her best sport, she had not made the cut. \"For the last two years I've had my life on hold for the Paralympics.\"</p> <p>She had already closed down her successful catering and restaurant business in order to concentrate on the 2010 Commonwealth Games, where she managed a sixth in the shot put. But, she said, \"It's more about the journey than the destination\" \u2013 and anyway, there's always Rio 2016.</p> <p>David Premanath, a chief coach for the Paralympic Committee of India, said there was no conspiracy to keep out Malik or other female athletes. The fact was, he said, India received just 10 places from the London organising committee and was obliged to choose its 10 most promising athletes. \"Even if 20 athletes qualify, we have to select the top 10 based on international rankings,\" he said. \"In sports, there is no such distinction as men and women.\"</p> <p>The fact that India \u2013 a country of 1.2 billion people \u2013 has just 10 places, none of them taken by women, shows how little support there is for the disabled, said Seema Baquer. She is the associate director of the Disability Rights Initiative at Delhi's Human Rights Law Network, which estimates that 70 million disabled Indians are \"treated as second-class citizens and are forced to confront segregation, discrimination, barriers and stereotypes\".</p> <p>She said: \"We find that the biggest problem is a general lack of awareness among families and communities about the capabilities and potential of people with disabilities. That support system \u2013 which realises that there's a still a lot they can achieve \u2013 is severely lacking. And even more so with women.\"</p> <p>Women with disabilities were a \"minority within a minority\", she said. \"There are a lot of barriers to the idea that disabled women can actually play sports.\"</p> <p>Malik is uniquely well placed to change attitudes to disability in India after two <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_825w7ngmY\" title=\"\">barnstorming appearances on MTV's Roadies</a>, a top-rated reality show which follows contestants on a road trip, completing challenges along the way. In 2007 she was shown on her specially adapted motorbike; earlier this year she was invited back on the programme, challenging contestants to a swimming race. Despite her opponents being allowed to wear life jackets, and Malik unable to use her legs, she wiped the floor with the lot of them.</p> <p>Then there are the three records she holds in Limca, India's answer to the Guinness World Records: most notably swimming against the current for 1km in the notoriously filthy and dangerous Yamuna river, and becoming the first woman with her level of disability to ride her motorbike across nine high altitude passes in nine days from Leh to Ladakh in the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir.</p> <p>Malik said there had been \"tremendous change\" in the 13 years since she became disabled after three spinal tumour surgeries.</p> <p>There were now lifts for wheelchair users on the Delhi metro, for example, and new buildings had to be accessible since India signed the United Nations convention on the rights of persons with disabilities in 2007. But, she said, a huge social stigma remained: \"There is still this pervasive religious view that if you are disabled, you have been cursed by the gods.\"</p>",

  "<p>Henry Morris and I come from different ends of the socio-economic spectrum. Whilst at a top independent school Henry and his peers were encouraged to join clubs for aspiring accountants, lawyers and doctors \u2013 my comprehensive struggled to cobble together a woodwork club, let alone anything related to selective professions. By the age of 16, Henry had completed work experience at multiple top firms. One week at the local bike shop had to suffice for me.</p> <p>Our backgrounds may have been different, but we met and became friends at university. There, we were struck by the contrasting aspirations and successes in clinching the elusive graduate job offer amongst our peers. To us, these different outcomes weren't all down to chance. Those from better off backgrounds, with the family contacts and parents who had \"been there\", were likely to be in with a better shot. Through no fault of their own, those from less privileged backgrounds at university started the race for top jobs later and struggled to catch up.</p> <p>Our personal experience is one thing, but what about the evidence? Studies by Bristol University and others have shown that undergraduates from less privileged backgrounds perform at least as well academically as their more privileged peers. For example, at Bristol <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03075070903414297\" title=\"\">88% of state school educated graduates received a 2.1 or above, compared with 85% of independently educated graduates</a>. However, equal academic attainment is not matched by equal graduate outcomes; fewer graduates from less privileged backgrounds progress into the professions relative to their more privileged peers. They also tend to earn less; <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2566136?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101009699733\" title=\"\">3\u00bd years after graduating, 33% of independently educated professionals earn over \u00a330,000, compared to 14% of state educated professionals</a>.</p> <p>Whilst students do equally well academically, could it be that different levels of knowledge, soft skills, networks and professional experience explain the difference in graduate outcomes? This isn't a point about the recruitment process \u2013 we've come a long way from the outright bias in selection processes of the past. But what if our economy's top talent are not applying to the professions proportionally and when they do they underachieve against their potential?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.upreach.org.uk/Access%20to%20the%20Professions%20once%20at%20University%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Issue.pdf\" title=\"\">The evidence shows that there are differences in the level of the key non-academic competencies required for access, and we know that the professions themselves are not socially representative</a>. For example, whereas <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com/news/news/the-educational-backgrounds-of-500-leading-figures/\">only 7% of the pupils attend independent schools, 54% of UK chief executives and 70% of finance directors were independently educated</a>.</p> <p>Reflecting upon our experiences, both Henry and I knew that there was a problem. Henry was acutely aware of the advantages he had in his journey towards job offers after graduation. For me, it was only through part-time work behind a desk at the university careers office that I really became aware of the breadth of career possibilities open to graduates of any discipline. Even then, this presented its own problem \u2013 how could I possibly make sense of all the different options available to me? The career-chooser computer software didn't really help either: despite my economics degree, one suggested that I should consider midwifery. The simple fact was that I had fewer sources of insight for advice on the careers that I was considering.</p> <p>Inspired by the emergence of social enterprise and its commercial approach to making positive impact, we explored the issue further. The first stage was to develop a tangible idea of how we could make a difference. After researching third sector, government, university and employer programmes, it became clear that there is no overarching programme that supports students who have overcome the odds in reaching university to fulfil their career potential. Indeed, it looked like the impact of social background in the transition from university to professions was the least explored area of the wider equality agenda.</p> <p>On the one hand, being at the forefront of this thinking was exciting \u2013 on the other, the challenges of explaining the significance of social background to employers was not always easy. Some were sceptical, suggesting that the barriers didn't exist and the fact that selection processes were fair was enough in itself. Others recognised that, in the battle for the best graduates, recruiters were missing out on top talent \u2013 many of whom will have demonstrated incredible resilience and adaptability just to get to university.</p> <p>Universities quickly recognised that ensuring undergraduates from less privileged backgrounds fulfil their career potential was a natural extension of their widening participation efforts. Indeed, in the world of \u00a39k fees, many universities have committed to this extension in their <a href=\"http://www.offa.org.uk/\" title=\"\">OFFA</a> agreements.</p> <p>Just a few months ago, both Henry and I had full-time jobs. Our time was limited, idea generation was slow, and developing new connections was painstaking. Soon our paths diverged.</p> <p>For Henry, working full-time and developing our idea on the side was unsustainable. He left his role at a tech startup to focus exclusively on turning the idea into reality. For me, the practicalities of moving to London to get involved full-time were more problematic, I remain in my post at Exeter University and offer support from a distance.</p> <p>Currently, <a href=\"http://upreach.org.uk/\" title=\"\">upReach</a> is engaging with employers, universities and policymakers to run a pilot programme in January 2013. We're honoured to have caught the imagination of influential leaders and are connecting with some of the UK's most prestigious graduate employers and universities. We've built a great team and are flourishing in our working environment, surrounded by an inspirational mix of founders and enterprises.</p> <p>I genuinely feel that upReach has the potential and people behind it to make a real difference to the lives of thousands of students across the country every year. upReach's journey began with our experiences in the past, but now we're working for a future where social background is no barrier for undergraduates to fulfil their career potential.</p> <p><em>Dale Potter works for the University of Exeter and helped <a href=\"http://www.upreach.org.uk/about.html\">Henry Morris</a> found <a href=\"http://www.upreach.org.uk\">upReach</a> \u2013 a social enterprise which aims to improve access to the professions for undergraduates from less privileged backgrounds.

  "<p>My friend George Balazs, who has died aged 92, was the former head of the BBC Monitoring outpost at Karen, near Nairobi. His death is a reminder of a whole generation of eastern and central Europeans who arrived on Britain's shores in the late 1930s and were snaffled up by the BBC. They were electrically intelligent and could speak foreign languages, even English.</p> <p>George was born in Transylvania. His family's language was Hungarian, but, due to the rearrangements made at Versailles in 1919, his homeland had been made part of Romania. George spoke Romanian in the street and German to the staff. The family was Jewish but George did not make a lot of it, though it must have been an early sniffing of the fascist winds in 1939 that encouraged him to head west.</p> <p>As a very young man \u2013 only 21 \u2013 he arrived as a student lawyer in England. Because Hungary was not in the conflict at that time, he was not drafted, imprisoned, interned nor sent back, but recruited by the BBC Monitoring Enterprise in Evesham, Worcestershire.</p> <p>He made the BBC his life. Like so many of his central European compatriots he became part of that busy, chattering class that informed the Bush House newsroom and the Monitoring Service at Caversham, Berkshire, in the postwar years. None of these people were that easy to get on with. George, to say the least, could be testy. But he and they brought us culture, knowledge and life.</p> <p>George's apotheosis was his appointment in 1972 as head of monitoring at Karen, where he had to control a motley crowd, which was listening to the feeds of radio stations from Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, the Congo and even Djibouti. French, Swahili, Amharic, Arabic, Persian and Somali (which in those days had no written text) swirled around the tiny collection of huts on the outskirts of Nairobi. From Karen, you could listen to the whole of the Horn of Africa, Yemen and even, on a clear day, central Africa. George, driving his orange Sunbeam Alpine to work every day, ran the show.</p> <p>He never lost his love of east Africa. He stayed there, at the Nairobi Club, after retirement in 1980, as long as he could, visiting Kenya in later years on winter cruises when a minor stroke had confined him to barracks in NW3.</p> <p>I last saw George at the Royal Free hospital in Hampstead, north London, not far from where he had spent the last 20 years of his life, walking daily on the heath. Despite macular degeneration, he knew every path and twig from his flat in Belsize Park, up to Kenwood House, and back again. In his hospital ward, from which he could look across the heath, the only item with him in those last days was his portable radio, tuned to Radio 3.</p>",

  "<p>Ray Bradbury was investigated by the FBI during the 1950s, with government agents interviewing his peers and putting him under surveillance before concluding that despite being critical of the US government in his writing, the celebrated writer was never a member of the Communist party.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/28/ray-bradbury-s-fbi-files.html\" title=\"\">40-page cache of the late science fiction author's FBI files</a> was obtained by the Daily Beast following a Freedom of Information request, and shows the extent to which the FBI had Bradbury in its sights in 1959. \"Raymond Douglas Bradbury, a freelance science fiction, television and motion picture scenario writer \u2026 has been described as being critical of the United States Government,\" the FBI wrote on 8 June 1959, before laying out its issue with Bradbury's classic collection of short stories, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/science-fiction/9780006479239/the-martian-chronicles\" title=\"\">The Martian Chronicles</a>. The stories \"were connected by the repeated theme that earthmen are despoilers and not developers\", according to the FBI.</p> <p>The FBI uncovered the information that \"Bradbury has been extremely successful in the writing field\". The bureau also discovered \"that Bradbury, while a young man, sold papers and did miscellaneous small jobs\", and that \"in 1942 his writing were beginning to return him a descent [sic] livelihood\".</p> <p>A named source in the file, Martin A Berkeley, told the agents investigating Bradbury that the author \"was probably sympathetic with certain pro-communist elements\", and that during a discussion about whether Communist party members should be allowed to join the Screen Writers Guild, Bradbury \"rose to his feet and shouted 'Cowards and McCarthyites' when the resolution was discussed\".</p> <p>Berkeley, a \"self-admitted\" former member of the Communist party, went on to tell the FBI \"that science fiction may be a lucrative field for the introduction of communist ideologies\", and that \"some of Bradbury's stories have been definitely slanted against the United States and its capitalistic form of government\".</p> <p>Another informant agreed about the dangerous effects of science fiction, advising \"that individuals such as Ray Bradbury are in a position to spread poison concerning political institutions in general and American institutions in particular\", and that \"Communists have found fertile opportunities for development; for spreading distrust and lack of confidence in America [sic] institutions in the area of science fiction writing\". Even worse, \"the general aim of these science fiction writers is to frighten the people into a state of paralysis or psychological incompetence bordering on hysteria which would make it very possible to conduct a Third World War which the American people would seriously believe could not be won since their morals had been seriously destroyed\".</p> <p>Bradbury did not help his own cause by taking out an advertisement in the <a href=\"http://www.variety.com/Home/\" title=\"\">Daily Variety</a> in 1952, in which, according to the FBI documents, he wrote: \"I have seen too much fear in a country that has no right to be afraid. I have seen too many campaigns in California, as well as in other states, won on the issue of fear itself, and not on the facts. I do not want to hear any more of this claptrap and nonsense from you. I will not welcome it from McCARTHY or McCARRAN, from Mr NIXON, DONALD JACKSON, or a man named SPARKMAN. I do not want any more lies, any more prejudice, any more smears. I do not want intimations, hearsay or rumour. I do not want unsigned letters or nameless telephone calls from either side, or from anyone.\"</p> <p>Despite this, the FBI concluded in 1959 that \"no evidences have been developed which indicate he was ever a member of the [ party]\".</p> <p>In 1968, however, it was investigating Bradbury again, looking into a potential trip by Bradbury to the Cultural Congress of Havana in Cuba, the purpose of which was \"to obtain unity of action in the anti-imperialist fight\". There appeared to be some confusion over the tip received by the federal agency, however: the named individual was one \"Roy Bradbury\", and after investigating Bradbury's passport file and lacking evidence that he had applied for or travelled to Cuba, it dropped the investigation, deciding not to interview the author. \"Due to Bradbury's background as a known liberal writer, vocal in anti-United States war policies, an interview with Bradbury would be deemed unadvisable,\" an agent wrote.</p> <p>Sam Weller, Bradbury's biographer, describes the FBI investigation in his book <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/literary-criticism/9780060545819/bradbury-chronicles-the-life-of-ray-bradbury\" title=\"\">The Bradbury Chronicles</a>. \"I remember distinctly his response when I visited him and presented him with the files,\" <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/28/inside-author-ray-bradbury-s-fbi-file-was-he-a-communist-sympathizer.html\" title=\"\">Weller told The Daily Beast</a>. \"He beamed ear to ear and dismissed it with a wave of his hand and laughed and he said, 'I'll be damned, I've had nothing to hide over the years \u2013 what are they going to investigate? What a bore.'\"</p>",
  "<p>Relatives of British businessman Neil Heywood will not challenge Gu Kailai's suspended death sentence for his murder, a lawyer hired by the family said as the deadline for an appeal passed.</p> <p>The wife of disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai was spared execution at a hearing last week, with a court in Hefei <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/gu-kailai-suspended-death-sentence\" title=\"\">instead handing her the suspended penalty</a>. Many saw that as unusually lenient for premeditated murder: unless she commits another crime while in jail, it will be commuted to life imprisonment after two years.</p> <p>In China, crime victims and their families have five days to ask prosecutors to appeal against verdicts and sentences. Prosecutors then have another five days to take the matter to the court.</p> <p>But He Zhengsheng, a lawyer hired by relatives of Heywood to represent them, said on Thursday that they had not contacted him to dispute the decision. He told the Guardian the judgement would therefore take full effect on Friday morning.</p> <p>The businessman's Chinese widow has not responded to reporters' queries and his family in Britain have chosen not to speak to the media.</p> <p>A spokesman for Hefei intermediate court said after Gu's hearing that the suspension of the death penalty reflected her regret, the fact she had given information about other people's crimes, and mental impairments she had suffered, which had weakened her self-control.</p> <p>It also said she believed Heywood was a threat to her son, Bo Guagua, because he had made verbal threats to the young man. Friends of the dead man say they do not believe he would have done so and allege he was smeared to justify a lighter sentence.</p> <p>Experts say a commuted death sentence usually leads to between 14 and 24 years in prison, and that Gu could be freed on medical parole in as little as nine years.</p> <p>A family aide, Zhang Xiaojun, was jailed for nine years for the same crime. The court said his sentence was lightened because he was an accessory to the murder, not the instigator, and because he had confessed and shown remorse.</p> <p>Lawyers for Gu, 53, and Zhang, 33, told the court during the hearing that they would not appeal against the judgement. Experts say there would be little point in them doing so in any case: the Communist party controls China's courts and such a sensitive decision would have been made at the highest level of the party.</p>",
  "<p>The UK should delay its plan to kill thousands of badgers this autumn so experts can consider whether the cull is in line with a European conservation law, actors and celebrities have urged in an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/30/badger-cull-complaint-ruling\">open letter</a> to the government.</p> <p>The pilot culls, designed to reduce tuberculosis in cattle, could be in breach of the Bern Convention that protects EU wildlife and habitats \u2013 despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/12/badger-cull-high-court-ruling\" title=\"\">being ruled legal by the UK high court this summer</a> \u2013 argue signatories to the letter including actors Joanna Lumley and Dame Judi Dench, TV presenters Chris Packham and Mark Carwardine and author Jilly Cooper.</p> <p>The secretariat of Bern said it believes there are grounds to consider whether the shooting of badgers by trained marksmen in Gloucestershire and Somerset as early as September breaches the convention, which the UK is a contracting party to, but its decision-making committee does not meet until November.</p> <p>\"The vast majority of available scientific evidence indicates that culling badgers \u2026 is not an effective way of controlling bTB [bovine tuberculosis] in cattle and can in fact increase incidence of bTB in some circumstances,\" says the letter.</p> <p>It continues: \"If, as it states, the government takes seriously its responsibilities to wildlife and respects the authority of the Bern Convention, it is logical that any badger cull be delayed until after the Convention has decided whether or not it might constitute a breach.\"</p> <p>Since the environment secretary, Caroline Spelman, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/19/badger-cull-caroline-spelman-shooting\" title=\"\">gave the green light in July last year for badger culls in England</a>, the proposals have faced criticism from scientists and high-profile public figures including Sir David Attenborough. Campaigners have hoped that the government would back down after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/20/badger-cull-wales-abandoned-vaccination\" title=\"\">the Welsh assembly reversed its decision to cull badgers</a> following strong public opposition.</p> <p> Farmers and the government say the disease, which can be spread by badgers as well as among cattle, has become a huge cost to the industry. In 2010-11, nearly 25,000 cattle were slaughtered in England at a cost of \u00a391m in government compensation.</p> <p>In July, the high court ruled against the Badger Trust in a judicial review that challenged the legality \u2013 rather than the scientific basis \u2013 of the plan to cull badgers, clearing the way for the pilots to go ahead.</p> <p>Humane Society International (HSI), which organised this week's open letter to Spelman, hopes it may stop large-scale culling by taking its battle to Europe.</p> <p>Mark Jones, veterinarian and HSI's UK director, told the Guardian: \"We believe that indiscriminately shooting these iconic creatures at night and potentially wiping out badgers altogether in some areas, must surely breach the convention. We're asking the government to have the decency to delay the killing so that Bern can properly consider the matter. With so many animals' lives at stake and in the face of such overwhelming scientific and conservation opposition, it would seem incredibly arrogant of the government not to do so.\"</p> <p>HSI submitted its complaint to Bern in January, but it is far from a foregone conclusion that it will be successful in using the convention to stop the culls.

As for sour grapes, if the HC were being dominated by Premiership and Top 14 clubs, they would not be complaining.</p> <p>Another issue is whether the HC stands alone or complements the Six Nations. Would no Scottish or Italian involvement in the former weaken the latter? A potential compromise would be to reduce the number of teams the Pro 12 countries are guaranteed in the Heineken Cup, Ireland and Wales down to two from three and Scotland and Italy reduced to one from two.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>2.22pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17984372\">gecko411</a></strong> has a request: <strong>\"Paul \u2013 please phone Heyneke Meyer and tell him his gameplan is outdated.</strong>\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17986724\">Paul replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>His comment before the start of the Rugby Chmapionship that the day of the specialist open-side flanker had gone signposted the way they were going, although he seems to have had a change of mind!</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>2.25pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17984401\">RallyRoundTheRobins</a></strong> asks: <strong>\"How did you celebrate the 117th anniversary of the formation of the 'Northern Union' yesterday?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17986756\">Paul replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>By listening to Get Well Soon's new album.</p> </blockquote> <p> <a href=\"http://get-well-soon.bandcamp.com/album/get-well-soon-ep\">This may or may not be the record to which Paul refers</a>.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>2.31pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17984547\">LarryMilne</a></strong> asks about the new rules: <strong>\"Concussion bin, extended TMO, 5 second rule at rucks - think that's it.\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17986982\">Paul replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Concussion rule long overdue. As for five seconds at rucks, I hope referees say \"out\" when time is up. Not sure about the extended powers of the TMO. If the start of the two-phase movement is a scrum or line-out that should not have been awarded to the attacking side, the argument will go on. Football has long been going on about goal-line technology, but if a video official rules that the ball crossed the line only for the scorer to have been in an off-side position, or to have handled the ball, has the game advanced. I guess it is about minimising mistakes, not eliminating them. And the scrum will have no pause before a collapse.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>2.35pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17984808\">Theboyspud</a></strong> asks about the relationship between Irish and Welsh rugby this year:<strong> \"Do you think the Pro 12 final loss to the Ospreys and the almighty tonking we received in NZ will continue to affect Irish players?</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17987147\">Paul replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Ireland came close to the ABs in the second Test, far more so than Australia this month.

England and France are the only two major countries in the world that operate club tournaments. Ireland's players are centrally contracted and their leading provinces are effectively nationalised by the Irish Rugby Football Union; Declan Kidney tells his players when they can play, as is the case with the England and Wales Cricket Board.

It is, though, significant that the French Rugby Federation backed their clubs in giving notice to quit; under French law, clubs are only allowed to play in tournaments sanctioned by their governing body.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 18 --> <p>3.06pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17987692\">Rachel685</a></strong> wants some predictions: <strong>\"Do you have one for the Top 14?

  "<p>The outlook for many people in Ethiopia seems less than bright following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/aug/21/ethiopia-renaissance-meles-zenawi\" title=\"\">the sudden death of the prime minister Meles Zenawi last week</a>, yet as far as the country's natural resources are concerned, the outlook is golden. Gold reserves could be a source of greater development for the country.</p> <p>British firm Nyota Minerals is about to become the first foreign company to receive a mining licence to extract gold from an estimated resource of 52 tonnes in western Ethiopia. Its chief executive, Richard Chase, was involved in Tanzania's gold boom in the 1990s. He believes Ethiopia has similar potential. \"There are huge areas of relatively underexplored and unexplored prospective ground, and the infrastructure is not too dissimilar [to Tanzania], although the availability of cheap electricity is a definite plus,\" he says.</p> <p>Ethiopia also boasts gemstones such as diamonds and sapphires; industrial minerals including potash; and other precious and base metals. The development of these resources is a key plank of the government's export-orientated growth strategy and allows <a href=\"http://www.nationalgeographic.com/coffee/map.html\" title=\"\">Africa's biggest coffee grower</a> to diversify its economy to reduce reliance on agriculture, which accounts for 43% of Ethiopia's gross domestic product.</p> <p>\"We expect our rich mineral wealth to contribute to economic development in Ethiopia,\" says the state minister of mines, Tolesa Shagi. Ethiopia's openness to foreign investment over the past decade is beginning to pay off, Tolesa believes. \"As an African country we have not had the knowledge or the resources until recent years,\" he says.</p> <p>A recent survey increased estimates of gold resources to 500 tonnes. The government says production could rise to 40 tonnes a year from just over four tonnes last year, earning the country around $1.7bn (\u00a31.1bn) at current prices. This could dramatically boost development and reduce dependency on imports. In the meantime, the mining sector is forecast to increase exports and earn foreign currency.</p> <p>The largest gold mine in Ethiopia is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2012/aug/30/gold-mining-ethiopia-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Lega Dembi</a> in the Sidamo province of southern Ethiopia. It was transferred from the government to a company called Midroc Gold, owned by billionaire Saudi businessman Mohammed Hussein al-Amoudi, for $172m in 1997. In 2010, Midroc began its second gold mining operation in Sakaro, near Lega Dembi. Amoudi has also made huge investments in Ethiopian agriculture, cement and transport. The relationship between the billionaire and the government has attracted fierce criticism from government opponents.</p> <p>After gold, tantalum is the next most sought after mineral in Ethiopia. Chinese firms are eyeing a deal with a state-owned company that claims it is the world's sixth-largest producer. Up to 80% of this precious metal is sold for use in the production of transistors for Chinese-assembled mobile phones, cameras and computers.</p> <p>Ethiopia has licensed 250 foreign firms, from countries including China, South Africa, the UK, the US and Canada, to prospect for minerals. Investment in the sector reached $1bn in 2009, according to official figures. An overstretched mines ministry is not accepting any further licence applications while it deals with assessing existing applicants and monitoring investments. Companies are now required to include an environmental and social impact assessment in their applications.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/article/gold-prices-soar-but-africa-loses-out-says-afdb-paper-9044/\" title=\"\">A recent paper by the African Development Bank</a> said a large number of resource-rich African countries are seeing little benefit from their mineral wealth. It also said some have not been accruing maximum benefit due to cushy deals for corporations.</p> <p>However, this could change if new legislation focusing on regulating the excesses of transnational mining companies has the desired effect. Ethiopia is planning to sign up to <a href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoupay.org/\" title=\"\">Publish What You Pay</a>. The international initiative, subscribed to by more than 70 countries, holds governments accountable for the management of revenues from the oil, gas and mining industries. Once fully signed up, Ethiopia will be expected to divulge all company payments and government revenues from its extractive industries.</p> <p>\"We want the mining industry to be for the people and not just for big business,\" says Tolesa. \"We have to be concerned about our community, our environment and the industry's contribution to the development of our nation.\"</p> <p>The Ethiopian Mining Proclamation states that the government requests 5% free equity shares with every licensed mining company operating in the country, as well as 35% income tax and 8% royalties.</p> <p>As well as <a href=\"http://www.et.undp.org/index.php?option=com_mdg&amp;Itemid=152\" title=\"\">more money to plough into development policies</a>, by opening up the mineral wealth to foreign investment Ethiopians could benefit from improved infrastructure, such as roads and greater employment opportunities.</p> <p>Investors see Ethiopia as a stable, investor-friendly country in the volatile Horn of Africa. Under Meles it attracted significant overseas investment \u2013 particularly from China \u2013 to help drive growth. Whether it will be business as usual in Ethiopia under Meles's successor, Hailemariam Desalegn, will be interesting to watch. As Nyota's Chase says: \"Ethiopia is undoubtedly a frontier for exploration in Africa.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was supposed to be Paul Ryan's night. The lineup of speakers was studded with the vice-presidential B listers from both Mitt Romney's first draft picks and the political writers' imaginations: Rob Portman, Tim Pawlenty, Condoleezza Rice, Susan Martinez, John Thune, Mike Huckabee.</p> <p>A major theme of the remarks was the disparagement of liberals' supposed desire to soothe feelings at all costs; Huckabee mocked the new-age parenting cliche of \"giving everyone a trophy for showing up\", but that is also a pretty apt description of how the night's slots seemed to be filled. One speaker actually won a prize for the night \u2013 unfortunately for the Romney campaign, it wasn't Paul Ryan. Former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice walked off the stage in a mist of wistfulness and applause as her passionate and positive message brought the convention to its feet and generated its first taste of unrehearsed, unexpected excitement.</p> <p>Paul Ryan gave a speech as well, and it delivered hormone-injected red meat to a hungry crowd, but it didn't show anyone anything new: In fact, he has been trotting out pieces of it to the stump ever since he accepted the position. The conventional wisdom always had it that Romney would select a \"boring white guy\", and, indeed, the men intended to warm up the stage for Ryan were warm-up speakers almost solely in the sense that their body temperatures may have heated the air around them. The reception they got was lukewarm.</p> <p>Huckabee, Pawlenty, Thune and Portman performed the same basic set of jokes and asserted the same slogans with such uniformity it was hard not imagine them as a single blurry white guy with an intermittent Southern accent, referencing Obama's lack of business experience, Romney revealing humble but generic origins.</p> <p>Again, there may have been a point to this homogeneity. By the time Huckabee got to his eighth recitation of the convention's slogan \u2013 \"We can do better!\" \u2013 one hoped that it was a more immediate assurance than a reference to whatever it is a Romney administration might plan. Sure enough, in the short term, the promise was fulfilled, spectacularly, by Rice.</p> <p>I cannot argue that her speech changed my mind about any of the policies she presented. She was an architect of Bush's pointless, tragic war in Iraq. The speech itself rolled out threats of further expansions in the conveniently ill-defined war on terror. Her economic and energy arguments were vague heralds of free market wish-fulfillment. But with the bar set low enough for Ryan to rise above it, Rice's rhetoric practically soared.</p> <p>Rice used the lens of her own unarguably audacious rise from a child in the deep south to focus on the kinds of ideas that inspire things besides rage. Whereas the generic humble beginnings narratives of the boring white guys filled in blanks, Rice filled hearts. Ironically, she articulated the vision of America that makes Romney's biography so discomforting. She said:</p> <blockquote> \"The essence of America \u2013 that which really unites us \u2013 is not ethnicity, or nationality or religion \u2013 it is an idea \u2013 and what an idea it is: that you can come from humble circumstances and do great things. That it doesn't matter where you came from but where you are going.\" </blockquote> <p>Rice ended \"on a personal note\" to reference \"a little girl grows up in Jim Crow Birmingham\" whose \"parents can't take her to a movie theatre or a restaurant\" but who make \"make her believe that even though she can't have a hamburger at the Woolworth's lunch counter, she can be president of the United States and she becomes the secretary of state\". The part about being in the cabinet and not the Oval Office sounds tacked on, but maybe I'm overly optimistic. But I'm not the only one with such a vision. After Rice spoke, Fox News confirmed that she delivered the speech without a prompter. For them, that is akin to printing \"CONDI 2016\" bumperstickers.</p> <p>Her speech suggested the kind of Republican who would truly \"raise the conversation\", and if it seems like settling to want an opposition party to simply not be so utterly vindictive, well, yes, I will settle for that. It might even mean that the Democrats would ratchet down their spite as well.</p> <p>Ryan's speech did not immediately follow Rice's \u2013 lucky for him. Susana Martinez, the governor of New Mexico, spoke after the secretary and in the context of Rice's ovation she did as well as one could possibly ask. That her first big applause line was for merely owning a gun did suggest that the convention was settling back in to its more familiar mode.</p> <p>Ryan picked up where the cliches before had left off. He only developed real energy as he tore his teeth into Obama, doing so with such delight that some <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/08/30/paul_ryans_brazen_lies/\" title=\"\">facts got mangled along the way</a>. There was the familiar lie about Obama's \"raiding\" of Medicare, and a repetition of the accusation that Obama \"closed\" a GM plant in Wisconsin in 2008 before he became president.</p> <p>Ryan's feistiness was probably the right note to end on. Whatever \"We can do better\" is supposed to mean, it's always best to keep focused on executing the next step ahead. For Romney and Ryan, that means ginning up as much antipathy for Obama as possible without making Americans feel stupid for voting for him in the first place. His image of \"college graduates \u2026 staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life\" is the kind of poignant conjecture that definitely sounds true.</p> <p>Ryan's fresh face and charm allow him to deliver the same old indictments in a way that makes them look like the revelations of someone who only just now realised they'd made a mistake. As a friend who has been disillusioned with Obama for some time now put it, \"He's the Boy Scout with a knife.\" Whether you're frightened or excited by that image tells you something about how you will respond to the Republicans' message on election day.</p>",
  "<p>The sublime and the ridiculous sit side by side in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/jul/31/adrian-noble-director-portrait-artist\" title=\"\">Adrian Noble</a>'s revival, a production modelled on one he staged at the Old Globe in San Diego in 2011. It's a mostly handsome show, played out on bare, bleached boards with the aid of a large billowing piece of blue silk that is neatly manipulated to create a sail, a canopy for betrothal, a stormy sea and even a bedsheet for the sleeping king.</p> <p>The evening is filled with the sound of the sea, and Shaun Davey's score combines a mood of something regal with some more ghostly and magical touches. A chorus of sprites \u2013 who on occasion resemble ministering nurses in a sanatorium \u2013 are a nice touch. They observe the action and respond to it with little claps and laughs like a ghostly audience. At the interval, they stare out into the auditorium intently, as if they can sense but not quite see us.</p> <p>So far, so good. But the good \u2013 most notably <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2011/oct/02/king-lear-pigott-smith-review\" title=\"\">Tim Pigott-Smith</a>'s Prospero, who begins as a a control freak but belatedly discovers he has a heart after all \u2013 does battle with the dull and downright odd. There's a puppet masque, which includes an unlikely homage to Riverdance, but the puppetry is scrappily done, and Mark Meadows's sweet-voiced Ariel suffers the indignity of having to lumber around on stilts for no good reason. Noble goes strong on the pageantry in the play's second half when he would be better simply telling the story. The production lacks a sense of humour, too, which means that Geoffrey Freshwater and Mark Hadfield, both fine actors, don't quite make the impact they should as Stephano and Trinculo.</p> <p>Matt Ryan's heavily tattooed Caliban is compelling, full of suppressed violence, and Iris Robert's Miranda is a sheer delight: direct, unfussy and full of wonder at discovering that the world is a far bigger place than she ever imagined. There are some great moments: when Prospero hugs his usurping brother, the latter responds with all the flexibility of an ironing board. The production needs more detail like this, and less concept. In the end it works its magic not because of how it looks, but because of the quiet, unshowy power of Pigott-Smith.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?button_hashtag=GdnReview\"class=\"twitter-hashtag-button\">Tweet #GdnReview</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){varjs,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script> </figure>",
  "<p>At least four government-sponsored programmes to deploy cyber-espionage software like the Flame, Duqu and Stuxnet software \u2013 the latter used against computers in Iran \u2013 are in progress around the world, according to sources in the intelligence and computer communities.</p> <p>Computer security experts say privately that the number of projects deployed is actually much higher, and that the systems have been under development since at least 1996, when the internet had barely begun its transition from a US government and academic network to an international and public one.</p> <p>\"There are a lot of countries that now have these systems. Every Middle Eastern country and all the states now known as the 'Stans' [Pakistan and the former satellite states of the Soviet Union] have them\", said another expert with close links to the UK intelligence agencies and who is actively engaged in combating the software.</p> <p>A former military officer based in London, he declined to be named on security grounds. \"Every nation now has an armoury; whether well-stocked or not depends on their resources,\" he said. \"They have a suite of weapons and another for intelligence gathering. Most of them are big players and their suites of tools all have different functions. Some are crude and blunt, some are very stealthy. Some have the ability to attack and they are built for that purpose,\" the expert said.</p> <p>In the past year the discovery of the Stuxnet virus \u2013 and subsequently of the Flame, Duqu and most recently Gauss malware \u2013 has brought the issue of state-sponsored cyberwarfare into sharp focus. Stuxnet was written jointly by the US and Israel and tested in Israel, according to authoritative reports, and performed the equivalent of a precision cyber attack to disrupt Iran's uranium refining systems \u2013 an attack which would have been impossible by conventional means.</p> <p>Suspicions that intelligence agencies have been developing such a capability for a long time were confirmed by a computer expert who has worked with a western intelligence agency.</p> <p>\"Work was done in 1996 on pixel call-back software,\" he said. \"It was used to infect websites and then track where people were coming from and then infect their machines and pass information back about them.\" The software worked by including a single pixel which linked to a web address controlled by the agency in an otherwise innocuous web page. If access by a target computer was detected, the agency could send malware to infect the machine.</p> <p>\"It was the basis of the work that we are seeing now,\" said the expert, adding that the mechanisms developed then found their way into the advertising industry \u2014 where \"web bugs\" became infamous as means of tracking users.</p> <p>\"They were a sort of cookie before people had even thought of them,\" said the man, who worked to develop the bugging programs to combat online criminals and potential terrorists. He says many of the programs now used by the advertising industry can be reverse-engineered to serve a similar function.</p> <p>The discovery of the Flame virus caused a furore among the technology community when it was found that the 20-megabyte program \u2013 unusually large for a virus \u2013 had been specifically designed as a highly targeted industrial espionage tool.</p> <p>Flame, which was first found by Kaspersky Labs, was specifically targeted at the Middle East and had been deliberately built to work for a limited amount of time in a specific geographical area. The virus works by turning over control of a computer to the system controlling it, and become both a remote listening device and information forwarding mechanism.</p> <p>The Kaspersky researchers say that the Flame virus shared similar components and telltale programming to the Stuxnet virus, which the Iranian government has blamed for the damage caused to its nuclear enrichment facility at Nantanz. That caused the facility's centrifuges to behave erratically and effectively sabotaged the Iranian nuclear programme, according to some experts, for between five and 10 years.</p> <p>Computer security companies working on both viruses have suggested that Flame was possibly an earlier system designed to collect data for the Stuxnet attack.</p> <p>Using parts of the same software for both made sense as Flame would have already penetrated part of the target to obtain the information needed, and so the payload could be guaranteed a way through.</p> <p>In the beginning of July, Indian officials announced that the headquarters of the Indian naval command had been penetrated by Chinese hackers who had used infected USB keys to smuggle an espionage virus onto its computers. This had occured at the same time as the Indian Navy's first nuclear submarine, INS Arihant, was undergoing trials at the facility.</p> <p>The Stuxnet virus also deployed infected USB keys as part of the method used to penetrate the Nantanz facility, and many similarities have been drawn between the attack on the Indian naval headquarters and Stuxnet.</p> <p>\"I am not surprised that we are seeing this,\" says Professor Andrew Blyth, head of the University of Glamorgan's Information Security Research Group, one of the GCHQ accredited centres of excellence.</p> <p>\"It takes around \u00a31m to develop a good piece of malware like this. We don't talk about that because it's so highly classified. I am surprised why, post-Stuxnet, people seem to be so shocked. We are in an information age and that has disrupted our world. There's an irony to that it's taken 60 years for Iran to try to develop a [nuclear] bomb, and two years for so many people to develop a cyber weapon.\"</p> <p>One reason, according to a former police officer now working in the computer forensics industry, is because the new espionage tools are being developed relatively easily out of innocent components. Like the anonymous expert, he says internet advertising components have provided convenient covers for espionage tools.</p> <p>\"We have seen three programs that are like the Transformers film franchise. They look to all intents and purposes like a genuine computer program but will develop other functions the moment that they get to where they are meant to be.</p> <p>\"We have also seen another program which is a TCP/IP worm that breaks into a number of different pieces like the melting alloy robot in Terminator. It attaches itself to TCP/IP packets so that it can get through the security systems and then reassembles itself on the other side.\"</p> <p>But according to Commodore Patrick Tyrrell, who wrote the first paper warning the UK Government of the threat of an information war in 1996, the rapid development of cyber weaponry was an inevitability.</p> <p>\"There is now the ability for a lot of countries to do this. Once the genie was out of the bottle with Stuxnet then it was always going to be a case of we must have our own variant or we will get left behind.</p> <p>\"I think what people are missing is military theory. Sun Tzu, the ancient Chinese military general, said that 'to subdue the enemy without fighting is the essence of skill', and [Carl von] Clausewitz said 'war is the continuation of policy by other means', and cyberspace is perfect for those ideas. It allows you to do something better with another tool,\" said Tyrrell, adding that the new developments meant that these weapons offer the opportunity for a different conflict over information assets.</p> <p>That point is underlined by Graham Wright, a former RAF Jaguar pilot, who until recently worked as the deputy head of cyber at the Cabinet Office. \"I think that people are badly obscuring this debate by using the word 'war',\" he comments. \"There is a difference between warfare and war and I think people need to subject this to the test of does it look and feel like war? The only time you are at war is when you can see the intent of the individual.</p> <p>\"I think that we may be getting closer to the boundaries and the development of capability is something that we need to counter, but talking of war is exaggerated.\"</p> <p>It's a distinction many agree with, pointing to the Cabinet Office-sponsored report into intellectual property theft which claimed the UK is losing \u00a327bn a year to foreign powers \u2013 a figure some observers say errs on the low side.</p> <p>\"A new industry has been generated in information theft that was not there a year ago. These are not tanks they are scouting systems and they are collecting information,\" said Mark Raeburn, CEO of Context, a company specialising in protecting against cyber espionage. It all depends on what use you put that information to.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Pete Warren is chairman and founder of the </strong><a href=\"http://www.csri.info/\" title=\"\"><strong>Cyber Research Security Institute </strong></a></p>",

Ambrose is on 92, within sight of his first century since August 2009, and Wright has 53.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>12.31pm: Warwickshire are 394 for 6 and batting Nottinghamshire out of the match and the title race, <em>writes Brian Halford</em>. A partnership of 97 in 23 overs between Ambrose and Wright ended when Wright (53, 64 balls) was well caught by Carter at long-on off White.</p> <p>But Blackwell got off the mark with a straight six and Ambrose is on 104, having reached is first century since August 2009.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>12.57pm: It has been Somerset's first hour, with Hildreth and Jones bringing the hundred up in the 31st over, <em>writes Richard Latham</em>. Both have played well, but Hildreth had a life on 25 when Rory Burns spilled a straightforward chance at leg-gully off Stuart Meaker, who again worked up good pace from the Old Pavilion End. </p> <p>It surely won't be long before Surrey turn to their spinners. Kartik opened up from the River End, but was quickly removed from the attack, despite turning one past Hildreth's outside edge. Both Somerset players are in sight of half-centuries and their stand is worth 84.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>1.06pm: Warwickshire went into lunch at 456 for 6 against Nottinghamshire after a morning session which brought them 158 for one and advanced them solidly towards the title, <em>writes Brian Halford</em>. </p> <p>On a pitch offering bowlers little help, Notts have posed little threat, as if sensing that their championship challenge is over. Ambrose is 122 not out, Blackwell 50. </p> <p>The question now: Can Notts resist the scoreboard pressure and prevent the Bears securing a win that would virtually seal the title?</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>1.51pm: Lunch at Taunton with Somerset 151-2 off 42 overs, having batted through the session without losing a wicket, <em>writes Richard Latham</em>. Hildreth is on 85 and Jones 50, with their partnership now worth 135. It is threatening to lay the foundation for a big Somerset total and the home side will be starting to think about only batting once in the game. </p> <p>A gusty wind has been strong enough to cause a problem with one of the sightscreens, with an area around it cordoned off for spectator safety. It probably hasn't helped the Surrey bowlers and the batsmen have looked increasingly in control.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>2.03pm: Warwickshire are piling the misery on Nottinghamshire at Edgbaston where Ian Blackwell's fifth six raises the century stand between he and Tim Ambrose, <em>writes Brian Halford</em>. </p> <p>The Bears are 483 for 6 with Blackwell 64 and Ambrose 135. Notts captain Chris Read has a king-size headache as to how to spark his increasingly flat team into life.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>2.18pm: Warwickshire have declared at 504 for six: Ambrose 151, Blackwell 69, <em>writes Brian Halford</em>. Ambrose reached his 150 and posted the 500 in the grand manner with a swept six off White.</p> <p>Notts need 355 to avoid follow on. On a very good batting pitch, with their strong batting line-up, they should achieve that comfortably but there is some scoreboard pressure now.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>2.35pm: Rain has stopped play at Edgbaston with Nottinghamshire 9 without loss, Hales and Wessels having negotiated 16 spheres without alarm, <em>writes Brian Halford</em>.</p> <p>Main covers on. Has there ever been a more persistently, depressingly wet cricket season?!</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p>3.18pm: Nottinghamshire are 26 for 1 after Wessels, on 10, flicked Wright carelessly to square-leg and Westwood took a sharp low catch, <em>writes Brian Halford</em>.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p>3.18pm: An extraordinary incident here as Murali Kartik has run out Alex Barrow backing up, deliberately removing the bails in his run-up with the Somerset man out of his ground, <em>writes Richard Latham</em>. </p> <p>It is not the done thing, although it is not clear whether Kartik had warned Barrow previously. Umpire Peter Hartley appeared to give Surrey skipper Gareth Batty the option of withdrawing the appeal as Barrow walked off, but it was declined. The crowd reacted by booing loudly and continued to jeer when Kartik began his next over. Next the umpires drew Batty aside and asked him to instruct his close fielders to curb remarks being made to batsman Peter Trego. </p> <p>Kartik had already removed Hildreth (85), Jones (50) and Jos Buttler (14) all to lbw verdicts since lunch and, with the atmosphere decidedly unsavoury, Somerset are 198-6.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p>4.14pm: Tea at Taunton with Surrey jeered off, having discovered that Peter 'Popeye-arms' Trego is not a man to upset, <em>writes Richard Latham</em>. His response to Kartik running out Barrow backing-up was to sweep the Indian left-arm spinner twice over deep square for six in moving to a half-century off 60 balls, which also included 8 fours. Alfonso Thomas made only eight in a seventh-wicket stand of 59, ended when Kartik trapped him lbw sweeping to claim his fourth wicket. He is still the villain as far as Somerset supporters are concerned, while skipper Batty was also roundly booed when he came on to bowl. Somerset 251-7 in reply to 317, with Trego unbeaten on 64, and a spicy conclusion to this game in prospect. Kartik 4-61 from 22 overs.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p>4.18pm: Nottinghamshire hit trouble at 49 for three, <em>writes Brian Halford</em>. Lumb perished carelessly when he drove at a wide, swinging ball from Barker and edged to Chopra at slip.. Taylor then acquired just a single before falling in unusual fashion, hit-wicket, having damaged his own stumps when forced back by a brisk delivery from Wright.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>4.52pm: Angry scenes beneath the Surrey dressing room balcony during tea, with Somerset skipper Marcus Trescothick coming down to placate one angry supporter and a man describing himself as a Surrey season ticket holder for years calling for the resignations of Batty and Kartik, <em>writes Richard Latham</em>. </p> <p>When the teams took the field again every Surrey player was booed, while Trego followed them to a huge ovation, with a mischievous smile on his face and raising his arms to call for even greater support. Comments from both camps and the umpires must wait until after the close of play. </p> <p>Now Trego has moved to 74 and it's fair to say he would relish a hundred today above any he has scored. There is a feeling that the spirit of cricket has been violated. Somerset 262-7 and 55 behind.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p>5.16pm: Trego has gone for 92, made off 110 balls, with 13 fours and 2 sixes, <em>writes Richard Latham</em>. He received a standing ovation from a now very partisan home crowd after being bowled by a delivery from Meaker with the second new ball that kept low. Into the arena strode the combative Steve Kirby, who is likely to relish the situation, but would prefer a ball to a bat as his weapon. Saj Mahmood is preparing to wield the long handle and Somerset are 294-9, hoping for a third batting point.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p>5.17pm: Richard Latham referred to \"angry scenes\" in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/aug/30/county-cricket-live#block-17\">his post below</a>.

It's just not cricket.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p>5.30pm: Alex Hales is keeping Nottinghamshire afloat at Edgbaston, 50 not out (86 balls, 7 fours) out of 121 for four, having lost a series of partners to careless strokes, <em>writes Brian Halford</em>. Last to go was Adam Voges who slashed Tom Milne's fifth ball to gully and was out for 8. </p> <p>Notts need 355 to avoid the follow-on. Adams, who will not play again this season, is expected to bat with a runner.

  "<p>The continued pressure for public sector organisations to do more with less means executives must find new ways to create efficiencies across existing areas of service provision.</p> <p>That requirement sounds straightforward enough but there is a snag, says Kent county council ICT director Peter Bole. Public sector CIOs cannot target the right service areas to address without good business intelligence, which in itself requires good information that can be easily located \u2013 and that is no easy task.</p> <p>The amount of data in all organisations continues to expand. Researcher IDC and technology company EMC report the amount of information created and replicated around the globe was more than 1.8tn gigabytes in 2011. The amount of information is expected to grow by 50 times during the next 10 years.</p> <p>Sifting and sorting that huge amount of information is becoming harder all the time, providing context to Bole's call for tools, such as business intelligence, that can help public sector CIOs understand underlying trends.</p> <p>\"Think about what you're trying to achieve,\" says Bole, who suggests the aim in the public sector is often to create knowledge that can help drive service improvement. Organisations, for example, might aim to aggregate and reduce silos of information to a smaller number of consolidated locations.</p> <p>Such consolidation is often a precursor to the implementation of analytical tools. Data aggregation and business intelligence can help executives collate knowledge and identify trends, but only if the requirement for service improvement is well defined.</p> <p>\"To make money go further, identify sections of the community that really benefit from your services and use business intelligence to make sure citizens are receiving the benefits,\" says Bole. \"Services must be more tailored \u2013 organisations should aim to move away from a broad-brush approach, and use business intelligence to understand where the demand for services really resides.\"</p> <p>Bole gives the example of a small number of families in each local authority who have higher than average requirements for access to public services from a broad range of agencies. Understanding the specific needs of each family through business intelligence, and tailoring services accordingly, would help improve quality and reduce costs.</p> <p>Work continues in other areas of information management, too. Bole is about to implement Collaborative Planning, Advanced Business Solutions' budgeting and forecasting system. Allied to other business intelligence technology, the system will allow Bole and his colleagues to make smarter spending decisions. \"It's about trying to harness more of the information the council has on its systems to improve operational efficiency,\" he says.</p> <p>Bole also recognises the importance of security, which he says must be an underlying concept for all information management strategies. CIOs have distinct requirements under the Data Protection Act and other areas of associated legislation. Such requirements are clearly understood by Steve Fraser, a relationship partner at accountant Monahans.</p> <p>He splits his time between advising clients and managing the firm's internal IT systems and is currently concentrating on the development of a new technology strategy for his firm. Fraser's work leads him to suggest IT professionals in his own business, and at client organisations, must prioritise information security as they seek to develop more intelligent forms of analytics.</p> <p>\"Data is everything \u2013 information really is the most valuable commodity of the modern organisation,\" says Fraser. \"People won't steal your money, they'll steal your data instead.\" Data security, and the requirement to stay in-line with an ever-increasing range of rules and regulation, must be core to the public sector CIO's strategy for information governance.</p> <p>Bill Limond, CIO at the City of London, says IT leaders need to pay attention to organisational standards. \"You have to have common data definitions and that takes an awful lot of effort,\" he says. \"You must be able to deal with issues around compliance and report across the broad spectrum of concerns. \"</p> <p>Creating an information management governance board can help. Limond warns that organisations tend to lose control if they do not put the right type of information governance in place. His own experience leads him to conclude that good business intelligence really does require senior level buy-in.</p> <p>\"The CIO has to be strategic,\" says Limond \"There's a lot of choice and it's giving IT leaders more options with regards to flexibility and capability. We're in a fast-moving world.\" Not that the City is shying away from change. Limond says the organisation is helping employees to share business intelligence through collaboration and has already implemented Microsoft SharePoint.</p> <p>Executive support has allowed Limond to make progress in three areas: management, collaboration and efficiency. He says the organisation is on a mission to facilitate the smarter management of information. Such business intelligence, he says, promotes the sharing of knowledge within the City and the potential streamlining of business processes.</p> <p>\"It's a journey; we're not there yet,\" says Limond, referring to continued progress towards dealing with the challenges associated to big data. \"You can't boil the ocean in one go. You need to make steps towards your goal and the progress we've made is encouraging.\"</p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>In the late 1990s, easy cash and irresponsibility became an art form. It was the time of the dotcom boom when a small number of clever, usually irreverent and often dysfunctional people invented great things and became billionaires overnight. Some became mainstream corporate bosses; others would disappear off the map. One of those who made silly amounts of money and then blew it all was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Harris_%28internet%29\" title=\"\">Josh&#xa0;Harris</a>.</p> <p>Harris was one of the early pioneers (bathos intended) of <em>Big Brother</em>-style reality television. His career culminated and collapsed in 2000 with the filming of his life, and that of his girlfriend, in a real-life internet show called <em>We Live in Public</em>. Everything they did, from sex to cooking dinner, was filmed and made available for anyone to see. He wanted to conceive a child online. \"Think about it, wouldn't you enjoy sex more if you knew you were being televised?\" Eventually his girlfriend, Tanya Corrin, became fed up with him, walked out and tried to get the rights to the hours of digital \"performance art\". This was the merging of counterculture and cyber-culture. This was New York's Silicon Alley at its peak of bling and hedonism.</p> <p>Harris's parties were chronicled in magazines around the world. An earlier project involved inviting around 100 people to his warehouse apartment, so big you could line up several double decker buses in it, for a collective social experiment in wired living. It was busted on millennium night by anti-terrorist cops fearing it might be a suicide cult.</p> <p>You might wonder why Harris's life story requires a book. But when I finished reading <em>Totally Wired</em>, I understood why the cultural journalist Andrew Smith had written it. This was a slice of life never to be repeated. Smith followed Harris for years, eventually catching up with him in Awasa, an Ethiopian town where he had gone to hide from the cacophony he had engendered in New York. \"The thing about life in deep Africa is that every day is a life-and-death experience and your senses get sharp,\" Harris tells Smith. \"New Yorkers think the world's ending if they can't get dinner reservations at the right restaurant.\"</p> <p>Smith traces the start of the internet generation, providing fascinating passages about some of the forgotten individuals (such as the 1960s military programmer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider\" title=\"\">JCR Licklider</a> \u2013 \"Lick to his friends\"), and the startups that quickly went flat. \"The first people to recognise the social power of the online idyll were the former flower children,\" he writes. The book is peppered with enjoyable anecdotes. \"The first online business transaction,\" he notes, \"is said to have involved a quantity of dope shipped between students at MIT and Stanford circa&#xa0;1971.\"</p> <p>By the mid-1990s, irrational exuberance had taken over, from the party-goer, to the nerd, to the investor, to bankers such as Alan Greenspan. The first initial public offering of shares was Netscape. And it went completely wild. From that point there was no going back. In 1997 <em>Wired</em>, the bible of the emerging online community, declared: \"We're facing 25 years of prosperity, freedom and a better environment for the whole world.\" Nasdaq, the US technology stock index known affectionally as \"Nazz\", couldn't stop rising. Some firms were valued in multiples far greater than their worth. As they partied and saw their fortunes soar, one chief executive warned his colleagues: \"This won't last for ever, enjoy it and remember it!\"</p> <p>Then came 2000 and the dotcom crash. Some retrenched, survived and went on to thrive. Others, like Harris, did not. He insisted his corporation, pseudo.com, was actually fake. He could not, would not, allow his mind to enter the \"grown-up\" business world. He preferred to host endless parties, interviewing characters about foot fetishism for his online show, and persuading the French champagne industry to sponsor a happening entitled \"The End Is Near\".</p> <p>Smith describes him as a modern-day Gatsby. Harris likens himself to a Warhol of the web. His friend and fellow indulger, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Calacanis\" title=\"\">Jason Calacanis</a>, said of him: \"He's one of the 10 most important people in the history of the internet and nobody knows who he is.\" Unlike Mark Zuckerberg and his ilk, with the world at his feet, Harris threw it all away, and seemed happy to.</p> <p>I wasn't sure in the end if I admired him for his refusal to be boring or if I scoffed at his self-indulgence. I suppose the answer is a bit of both. This was an age of excess and innocence unleashed by the breaking of financial and communications barriers. Even the Clinton administration, which bought into the optimism of the moment, was worried by the loss of state control. It was the first government to try to establish surveillance over all electronic traffic, via a so-called \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip\" title=\"\">clipper chip</a>\", which was seen off technically by the cyber&#xa0;geeks.</p> <p>Now, more than a decade on, the authoritarians are far more successful in watching, listening and following us online. The internet is much more sober now.</p> <p><em>John Kampfner is author of Blair's Wars and Freedom For Sale</em></p>",
  "<p>Portuguese local authorities are still working on the basis of a political and administrative system designed for the country's transition to democracy in the 1970s. Now Portugal's public administration needs to change to keep up with new demands and it was inevitable that the country would, sooner or later, engage in a profound reform of its local government structure.</p> <p>However, this process was suddenly accelerated by the country's EU bailout agreement. The 2011 green paper on local administration reform sets a number of challenges that need to be met in 2012. Though amalgamating local administrations was one of the recommended strategies, the historical roots of municipalism in Portugal and the stability of its local borders led to popular concern over imposed structures and Portuguese local authorities are calling for an alternative approach.</p> <p>The main challenge for the reform of local government is the strong centralised tradition of the country and its cultural reluctance to test new ways of distributing power and responsibility between the centre and local areas. Two, apparently contradictory, mechanisms are being considered: an increase of the central supervision and control over local authority activities and, at the same time, devolution of power to an intermediate arrangement at the inter-municipal level.</p> <p>The legal framework produced and the incentives proposed for councils suggest that Portugal intends to strengthen metropolitan areas. Two recent pilot studies commissioned by the government show how this creates a contradictory mix of centralisation and devolution. Though it is expected that powers will be passed down from councils to communities, there is no expected devolution from central government to municipalities. Instead, reform seems to be following the path of central supervision and reinforcement of government control.</p> <p>Despite a government green paper, there is no formal strategy for this refom. It is being handled in case-by-case, detached legislative initiatives. There are major setbacks for local government if this is not improved: it does not allow self-government and local autonomy; it leaves no room for diversity in governance models to meet local needs; and, most crucially, it fails to reform the funding of Portugese local government to allow a higher degree of financial independence.</p> <p>As the bailout agreement was the main catalyst for reform, the need to cut public administration costs and the deadlines imposed on making these efficiencies create a perverse incentive for central government to push through ad-hoc and fragmented change. These political and economical demands, together with the country's strong local identities and the political costs of significant territorial changes, explains the absence of a coherent strategy for reform.</p> <p>Local autonomy and self-government \u2013 though prerequisites of reform, at least rhetorically \u2013 are excluded from the real debate around local government. Portuguese councils are working within a political culture that does not allow for radical reforms of the administrative system.</p> <p><em>Dr Filipe Teles is assistant professor in the department of social, political and territorial sciences at the </em><a href=\"http://www.ua.pt/\" title=\"\"><em>University of Aveiro</em></a><em>, Portugal</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for more comment, analysis and best practice direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>Amazon has launched its Appstore for Android apps in five European countries, which will fuel speculation that the company's Kindle Fire tablet is poised to cross the Atlantic too.</p> <p>The Appstore is live in the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/get-appstore\">UK</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.de/app-shop-download\">Germany</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.fr/app-shop-download\">France</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.it/scopri-app-shop\">Italy</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.es/obtener-tienda-apps\">Spain</a>, offering free and paid Android apps for smartphones and tablets, just as it has done in the US since its launch there in March 2011.</p> <p>Marketing promotions including Free App of the Day are also making the jump, with Rovio's premium (i.e. ad-free) version of Angry Birds the first app to get the treatment, followed by PopCap's Plants Vs. Zombies. Amazon is making the Appstore's own Android app available in these countries, so people can browse and download on their devices.</p> <p>Amazon is also promising a focus on locally-relevant apps, with UK startup Zolmo's Jamie Oliver's 20 Minute Meals app getting a promotional push on the store, as well as Skyscanner, Who Wants to be a Millionaire and Cut the Rope.</p> <p>\"Customers in the US have purchased millions of apps, games, in-app items and subscriptions since the store launched last year, and we've received great feedback about discovery features like Free App of the Day,\" says Amazon's vice president of Amazon Appstore Jim Adkins, in a statement.</p> <p>\"Amazon has spent years developing innovative features that help customers find and discover the products that are right for them and have applied that know-how to the Amazon Appstore. We're delighted to extend that experience to our European customers.\"</p> <p>The store's launch paves the way for the European debut of the Android-based Kindle Fire tablet, which has been only available in the US since its launch in November 2011.</p> <p>Amazon is holding a press conference on 6 September in Los Angeles, where it is expected to unveil a second-generation version of the tablet. That may now also herald an announcement of plans for European distribution for the new device.</p> <p>That said, apps are only part of the story. Amazon has made tight integration of its music, movies and e-books services key selling points for the Kindle Fire in the US. While its Kindle store is well established in Europe, the company has work to do in rolling out music and movies in the region.</p> <p>Amazon's press release for the Appstore's European launch quotes a number of approving developers: Zolmo, Rovio, Glu Mobile, TinyCo and Skyscanner. However, the store has not been without controversy among the app development community.</p> <p>In April 2011, games industry body the IGDA <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2011/apr/14/amazon-android-appstore-igda\">sent an \"important advisory\" to its members</a> warning them about some of Amazon's submission policies for its store, criticising the way it reserved the right to vary the price of apps or even drop them to free at any time, paying developers either 70% of the purchase price or 20% of the original list price.</p> <p>\"While many other retailers, both physical and digital, also exert control over the price of products in their markets, we are not aware of any other retailer having a formal policy of paying a supplier just 20% of the supplier's minimum list price without the supplier's permission,\" noted the IGDA's letter, at the time.</p> <p>While many developers have happily signed up to the store with eyes open wide to the policy, some genres \u2013&#xa0;premium book-apps, for example, which should be a good fit for the Kindle Fire \u2013&#xa0;have seen more reluctance from publishers.</p> <p>\"f we were to sign the contract with them that they wanted us to, although we get to set the price of our titles, they can lower that down to nothing if they want to,\" Touch Press chief executive Max Whitby <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2011/dec/21/touch-press-book-apps-interview\">told The Guardian</a> in December 2011.</p> <p>\"They'll pay us a bit \u2013 70% of 20% of the price that we set \u2013 so we'd get $1.40 for The Elements. We're not prepared to take that risk: it's destroying value. What's been very good about the iTunes Store and Apple is that it has encouraged a culture of quality. People go there to find what's good. Amazon is the Ryanair of digital publishing!\"</p> <p>Clearly, plenty of developers are happy to swallow these terms, in the hope that the growing scale of the Amazon Appstore \u2013 which the European launches will help \u2013&#xa0;and the company's famed recommendation engine will open up a new and lucrative distribution channel for their Android apps.</p>",
  "<p>Cases of tuberculosis that are resistant to virtually all drugs currently available to treat the disease are increasing at an alarming rate around the world, according to a study.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)60734-X/abstract\" title=\"\">The paper, in the Lancet medical journal</a>, shows that nearly half (47%) of TB cases that were already resistant to the two basic antibiotics used as standard treatment were also resistant to one of the second-line drugs that doctors try when the standard combination fails. The problem was worst in Latvia, where 62% of multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR TB) was not susceptible to at least one second-line drug.</p> <p>The researchers also found a worrying increase in cases that were resistant to the entire class of oral second-line antibiotics known as fluoroquinolones, as well as one of the injectables \u2013 which is the criteria for being categorised as extensively drug-resistant (XDR TB). Overall, they found that 6.7% of patients with drug-resistant strains had XDR TB, which is very hard and expensive to treat and takes years rather than months in affluent nations.</p> <p>In poorer countries, the necessary treatment is not available. The highest rates of XDR TB were in South Korea, at 15.2%, and Russia, at 11.3%.</p> <p>Drug-resistant tuberculosis has spread around the world and has now been identified in 77 countries, but many of the worst-hit have inadequate laboratory diagnostic capacity and poor data collection so the exact prevalence is difficult to know.</p> <p>The survey, by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, found that XDR TB was most likely to develop when treatment for MDR TB had not been properly completed. It found that the risk of XDR disease was more than quadrupled in previously treated patients. Previous treatment with second-line drugs was consistently the strongest risk factor for resistance to these drugs.</p> <p>\"Drug-resistant TB is more difficult and costly to treat, and more often fatal,\" said Tracy Dalton, the study's lead author. \"Internationally, it is particularly worrisome in areas with fewer resources and less access to effective therapies. As more individuals are diagnosed with, and treated for, drug-resistant TB, more resistance to second-line drugs is expected to emerge.\"</p> <p>She added that social factors needed to be taken into account in the care of TB patients, who were more likely to develop resistance to second-line treatment if they were unemployed or had a history of imprisonment, alcohol abuse and smoking.</p> <p>Sven Hoffner from the Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control said new information on the spread of drug-resistant TB was urgently needed. \"Most international recommendations for TB control have been developed for MDR TB prevalence of up to around 5%. Yet now we face prevalence up to 10 times higher in some places, where almost half of the patients with infectious disease are transmitting MDR strains,\" he said in a commentary published with the paper in the Lancet.</p> <p>The most recent estimates on drug resistance from the World Health Organisation suggest that around 9% is XDR TB. Dr Karin Weyer of the WHO's Stop TB Partnership said she welcomed any new data emerging but warned that in all but Estonia and Latvia, the studies were centred on specialist MDR TB referral centres and were not necessarily representative of the epidemic in each of the eight countries.</p> <p>\"The findings apply to the catchment areas around those centres, but you can't infer that the results are population-based and representative of the whole country,\" she said.</p> <p>She saw the study as a wake-up call, however. \"If you don't manage MDR properly, you end up with XDR,\" she said.</p> <p>Dr Mel Spigelman, the chief executive of TB Alliance, which is working to develop new drugs to fight the disease, said the findings further confirmed the urgency of addressing the TB epidemic. \"Specifically, these data reflect both the inadequacies of current TB treatments and the ability of drug-resistant TB to spread from person to person,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Faster-acting, simpler, more affordable, novel therapies are crucial and have the potential to treat both drug-resistant and drug-sensitive TB, improving adherence to treatment and expediting scale-up of suitable, cost-effective treatment, especially of drug-resistant TB.\"</p> <p>New treatments were in the pipeline, but money and political will would be needed to make them reality, he said.</p>",

  "<p>This week's playlist has been selected by Magicman.</p> <p>\u2022 My favourite song title this week was Jetplane Landing's There Is No Real Courage Unless There Is Fear. As commentators from Nelson Mandela to Mary Tyler-Moore have noted, being brave is actually acknowledging you are afraid, then acting anyway. </p> <p>Many nominations involved fighting, and this week's opening theme Warrior Charge by UK reggae giants Aswad is an inspirational fanfare that creates courage in the listener by sheer force of riddim.</p> <p>\"His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy, there's vomit on his shirt already, mom's spaghetti.\" Thus begins one of hip-hop's most thrilling five minutes: Lose Yourself from Eminem. The heartbeat-thumping verse suddenly lurches onto the backbeat as he moves from fear to focus.</p> <p>The voice from above creates courage in Jeff Lynne's wonderfully over-produced superpop creation The Diary Of Horace Wimp from ELO. Don't be afraid - Just knock on the door\u2026 Horace has to summon courage from the depths of his extreme weediness to get the girl.</p> <p>And what if it doesn't work out? Taking the courage to be single was Gloria Gaynor's mighty empowering disco anthem I Will Survive whose first verse expresses doubt but\u2026did you think I'd crumble?\u2026 before the chorus has roomfuls of people dancing bravely, imagining that no one is watching.</p> <p>The Minstrel Boy, written by Irishman Thomas Moore over 200 years ago, tells of a musician sent to war and has been recorded countless times. The final quatrain could have been written for Paul Robeson, one of the more courageous artists of the 20th century. </p> <p>Robeson delivered an astounding version of the Chinese National Anthem at the height of his struggle, and the next song, Cui Jian's Nothing to My Name was adopted by the students of the Tiananmen Square uprising of 1989 where the ensuing clampdown led to thousands dead and Jian being banned from performance for 10 years. On its surface a love song, in it's effect a call for freedom.</p> <p>Follow the yellow brick road to Africa, and a lion who does have courage. The Lion/Gaiende is from Senegalese musical giant and presidential hopeful Youssou N'Dour who sings in Wolof: \"We are famous for our courage, our bravery is legendary.\"</p> <p>Something Inside So Strong was penned by British songwriter Labi Siffre after watching policemen shooting at black children in apartheid South Africa on TV. It is at once a lament and a massive statement of conviction.</p> <p>The Sun's Comin' Over the Hill by Karine Polwart is a stunning piece of work that inspires calm and courage to just carry on, the simple bravery of getting up in the morning when all feels desperate never sounded so clear.</p> <p>Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's advice from The King and I to Whistle a Happy Tune was nominated by daddypig for Grover &amp; Cookie Monster but I hope the RR collective will forgive me for giving the nod to the late great Bing Crosby, the first modern pop star.</p> <p>Wade in the Water is a legendary and much-covered baptism hymn that became a trigger to escape from slavery when sung on the plantation. The honours here go to Sam Cooke whose own career from gospel to popstar mirrors the song's history.</p> <p>Finally and almost unbearably \u2013 Gorecki's Symphony of Sorrowful Songs (2nd movement) takes a desperate scrawl found on the walls of a Gestapo cell in WW2, written by an 18-year-old Polish prisoner: \"Oh Mamma do not cry\" and turns it into a paean to personal courage in the face of the worst nightmare.</p> <p>Screw your courage to the sticking place mes braves and sign up for a weekend in the saddle.</p> <p>1. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23qWXIqIogs\">Warrior Charge \u2013 Aswad</a></p> <p>2. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TADyXC2K0g\">Lose Yourself \u2013 Eminem</a></p> <p>3. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFU9HYyMVxQ\">The Diary of Horace Wimp \u2013 ELO</a></p> <p>4. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBR2G-iI3-I\">I Will Survive \u2013 Gloria Gaynor</a></p> <p>5. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8jlCedM-cE\">The Minstrel Boy \u2013 Paul Robeson</a> </p> <p>6. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYwsPt854Xo\">Nothing to My Name \u2013 Cui Jian</a></p> <p>7. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em3hmP5l9Ik\">The Lion Gaiende \u2013 Youssou N'dour</a></p> <p>8. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otuwNwsqHmQ\">Something Inside So Strong \u2013&#xa0;Labi Siffre</a></p> <p>9. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH4sq3hwO5M\">The Suns Comin' Over the Hill \u2013 Karine Polwart </a></p> <p>10. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E8Xf0x6UEg\">I Whistle a Happy Tune \u2013 Bing Crosby</a></p> <p>11. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zoVoquzQvc&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL08621F365BED63E0&amp;feature=results_video\">Wade in the Water \u2013 Sam Cooke</a></p> <p>12. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvXjo9x0xtg\">2nd Movement, Symphony of Sorrowful Songs \u2013 Gorecki</a></p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL511AE30AA40A3588\">Listen to these songs on a YouTube playlist</a>.</p> <p>* Read all the readers' recommendations on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2012/aug/23/readers-recommend-songs-about-bravery\">last week's blog</a>, from which Magicman selected the songs above.</p> <p>* Here's a<a href=\"http://open.spotify.com/user/guardianmusic/playlist/6MO354H7MGpHfUBBC7zQgb\"> Spotify playlist</a> containing readers' recommendations on this theme.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:6MO354H7MGpHfUBBC7zQgb\"> <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:6MO354H7MGpHfUBBC7zQgb\" width=\"460\" height=\"540\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>* Interested in compiling a Readers Recommend playlist?

  "<p>Six weeks before sex reassignment surgery (SRS), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jan/12/transgender-health-and-wellbeing\">I am obliged to stop taking my hormones</a>. I suddenly feel very differently about my forthcoming operation. I'd previously seen transition as a marathon: surgery was like breaking the tape, but the race was won far earlier. Now I reconsider: perhaps this is more like a difficult cup final after some hard previous rounds.</p> <p>The surgery completely dominates my planning and thinking. My temporary job ended in March, and the knowledge that I'd be incapacitated for at least two months from mid-July made it difficult to find another. Ineligible for <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndBenefits/BenefitsTaxCreditsAndOtherSupport/Illorinjured/DG_171894\">Employment and Support Allowance</a> until after surgery, I sign on, the whole scenario feeling farcical as both my case worker and I know that I am unlikely to get a job, but still have to fulfil the <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_200090.html\">jobseekers' criteria</a> to get my weekly allowance, haemorrhaging money all the while.</p> <p>It consumes my conversations as it inches closer. I am constantly asked how I feel: everyone expects a mixture of excited and nervous, and they are right. Above all, I'll be glad when it is over. I take a little holiday in late June, staying with friends in Scotland, and travel back on the first day of July. Then, for the next fortnight, my concerns over the practical, physical and psychological effects of SRS intensify by the day.</p> <p>My psychotherapist, whom I've been seeing all year, tells me that I've barely touched on the surgery, so I devote my final pre-surgical appointment to it. After an hour of airing my anxieties, I feel calm and able to continue.</p> <h2>Final preparations</h2> <p>Five days before checking into hospital, I sign off. Returning from the Jobcentre, a man with a taste for \"shemales\" (his word) follows me home, making me feel far less secure in my house \u2013 my sanctuary in a life that has felt in constant chaos. I break down in tears, crying for 30 years of feeling like an outsider, 20 years of knowing this to be related to my gender, 10 years of exploring it, three years of transition and two years of writing about it, with all their stresses and traumas simultaneously hurtling to the fore.</p> <p>For four days, everything makes me weep. At first it's painful, then cathartic, and finally just annoying \u2013 having not cried when I expected to for years, the sight of every ornament, every poster in my house sets me off, and I don't know when it'll stop. Eventually, I realise I need to get out: I visit old friends in Brighton, who indulge me as I discourse about the run-up to surgery and my feelings about it.</p> <p>I return a day before admission: having to address the practicalities pulls me together, as I ensure I have everything I'll want or need during the seven-day stay. I've never been seriously ill or injured, so I've sought advice on what to take: I buy slippers and a crossword book. Once I've got everything on my list, and packed, I feel completely relaxed. I go to bed content, close my eyes, and then see a car crash outside my bedroom window. It's so vivid, it takes several moments to realise that the flaming wreckage is no more than the invention of my hyperactive subconscious, but once I do, I get a solid night's sleep \u2013 my last for some time.</p> <p>Obsessed with being brave and independent, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/may/15/transgender-journey-reality-surgery\">I'd travelled alone to my previous surgical appointments</a>. This time, on advice, I've arranged for my friend Tania to take me to hospital. She arrives around midday: we eat in my favourite cafe and then get the tube to Hammersmith, well before I have to report to Charing Cross hospital reception at 4pm. We say little, putting our arms round each other, but once I've checked in, she gives me some earplugs and a cuddly tiger (\"You'll need a soft toy, trust me\"). Then she goes, telling me to surrender myself to the nurses, and I find my bed in F bay on the Marjorie Warren ward.</p> <h2>In the ward</h2> <p>There are six beds, with most but not all occupants also undergoing SRS. Reassuringly, there are two people who had surgery a day before, who can hold conversations and move unaided. We chat before the nurses take my weight and blood pressure, measuring me for stockings to fight deep vein thrombosis as I'll be spending so long in bed. I order dinner and then sleep, struggling more with the sweltering temperature than anything else.</p> <p>At 5.30am, I'm woken for an enema: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/18/transgender-journey-teeth-gritted-fists-clenched-toes-curled\">they have to thoroughly clear my bowels before the procedure</a>. It's not pretty but I take it, shower and return to bed. At 7am, <a href=\"http://www.genderxchange.co.uk/\">James Bellringer, the surgeon</a>, enters with two consent forms \u2013 one for the hospital, the other for me. He asks if I will allow \"the tissue removed\" to be used for medical science. In the hazy half-light, I agree (to the disappointment, I imagine, of friends who've asked if they can have it). \"I'll see you soon,\" he says. The anaesthetist comes soon after and asks several questions before I lie back down.</p> <p>At 8.20am, I'm escorted upstairs. I take the lift to the 15th floor in my slippers, white hospital gown and navy stockings. The chattering voices in my head silence themselves, with just the closing bars of a favourite song, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VIqA3i2zQw\">Laurie Anderson's O Superman</a>, soaring through my mind, and I am ready.</p> <p>Yuri, who assists the anaesthetist, lays me on a trolley and takes my blood pressure and temperature. The anaesthetist enters, attaching a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannula\">cannula</a> to my right wrist. She asks if I have any questions. \"This'll definitely work, right?\" Yes, she says, irked. \"It's just that I studied <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/h/health-and-medicine-in-the-19th-century/\">19th-century medicine</a>,\" I say. \"It didn't fill me with confidence.\"</p> <p>\"It'll be fine\", she says, raising a needle. \"You may feel a shooting sensation in your arm \u2026\"</p> <p>I wake in the recovery room, dehydrated, my lips bone-dry. I demand water, but it's nil by mouth until I return to the ward. I'm slow to come round, though, and they won't move me until I'm fully awake, however much I ask. After what seems an age \u2013 I've no idea how long \u2013 they wheel my bed into the lift, and then back to F bay.</p> <p>The women there are glad to see me back: I tell them that it went well, before finding a wave of \"good luck\" messages on my phone. I go on Twitter to say that I'm conscious again; throughout my stay, social media keeps me sane, providing contact with friends, family and well-wishers at any time, saving dozens of energy-sapping conversations.</p> <h2>The first night</h2> <p>The nurses set up intravenous morphine, which goes towards compensating for the hated catheter bag strapped to my thigh. The machine bleeps whenever morphine is administered, which is not every time I press it, and it does bizarre things to my sleep: I close my eyes for what feels like several hours, only to find it's been five minutes, but I get through the night. Dizzy and nauseous, I try not to be tetchy with the nurses, who do their best, but I struggle with the shared ward, wanting my own space and getting annoyed when they open the curtains without asking, feeling guilty about occupying myself with my headphones although everyone else is perfectly understanding.</p> <p>One day after the operation, the morphine is removed. The nurses say it's to stop me getting addicted: I argue, unsuccessfully, that we can cross that bridge when we come to it. It's replaced by paracetamol and ibuprofen, which doesn't always shift a headache, and proves woefully inadequate. With vaginal packing to keep me open, I'm in severe discomfort: the lights go out at 10pm, and, laid flat on the hard mattress, with resting on my side impossible for the foreseeable future, I cannot sleep, the excess light, sound and heat driving me crazy.</p> <p>At 3.30am, I ring for the nurse. She comes, and I beg for sleeping pills, or stronger painkillers. I needed to ask earlier for pills as they have to be prescribed, and I've had my allotted pain relief, so there's nothing she can do. I ask when the packing comes out. \"Monday\", she says, which I repeat in disbelief: it sounds an eternity. Then she leaves. Trying not to scream, convinced that no operation could ever be worth this level of pain and cursing myself for signing up, my outlet is Twitter. I post that this is the worst night of my life, and that I feel like I may never sleep again, and a handful of kind responses from insomniac friends and transatlantic contacts give me a little cheer.</p> <p>At 6.30am, I fall asleep. I wake an hour later, to find nothing has changed, and it feels like this night will last forever. A nurse enters to take my blood pressure and I start crying, having promised myself I wouldn't, for the loss of independence, privacy and dignity, symbolised by the hospital staff changing me like a baby. \"You surrender those when you walk in, I'm afraid,\" she says: harsh as it sounds, the reminder that these feelings are to be expected provides comfort, and night eventually rolls into day, clearly demarcated by the nurses turning on the lights, opening the curtains and offering breakfast.</p> <p>Manjit, the nurse specialist, comes to check the wound, removing the pad over it. I look down and start hyperventilating: it's encircled by heavy bruising, the pad splattered in blood and pus. She insists I tell her what's wrong: I say it's discombobulating and looks disgusting. Worse, there's a \"phantom limb\" sensation, as I think I can feel the old organ moving in the itchy cloth underwear like it used to, even though I know it's gone. Psychologically it's unbearable. This will pass, she says; there are no complications, so all will heal.</p> <h2>The day room</h2> <p>My old university friend <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/talent-issue--the-novelist-joe-stretch-766036.html\">Joe Stretch</a> is coming down from Manchester to visit. With time passing so slowly, the prospect of his company keeps me going: I text to say that as he's coming before dedicated visiting hours, he must meet me in the day room, and that as I've not slept and am in absolute agony, I won't be at my best. Even though it hurts to laugh, his reply is perfect:</p> <p>'Stop moaning! It's probably just a cold!'</p> <p>At 10am he arrives and I shuffle to the day room, moving like a toddler who's learned to walk by watching John Wayne films. Gently, he hugs me, and we sit. I take the sofa as I need to stretch my legs out, and talk him through everything from leaving my house to the present. I keep stopping, holding my forehead as the physical and psychological pains engulf me, but after an hour, I'm done. I pause, then ask: \"Anyway, how are things with you?\"</p> <p>We laugh, but I insist he tells me: other people's lives reintroduce normality, and discussing our usual subjects becomes really important. To make myself feel more human, I've put on makeup. We joke about the contrast between that and my \"sexy\" catheter.</p> <p>Feeling less tired and looking better than I'd expected, I change my pads and empty the catheter myself, passing time by watching <a href=\"http://archive.org/details/The_Impossible_Voyage\">Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s films</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIkxLneBs2I\">Paul Merton's programme on Buster Keaton</a> on my laptop. Billie, who's had her operation days earlier, introduces herself. We click, sharing a love of sport, political theatre and literature; she looks at my books, and I tell her that the only one I can handle is a favourite volume of poetry, <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/43651031/Paroles-by-Prevert\">Jacques Pr\u00e9vert's Paroles</a>. She's intrigued, and suddenly, in this rarefied environment, there's an unanticipated moment of beauty. She sits, takes my hand and reads:</p> <p><strong>To Paint the Portrait of a Bird</strong></p> <p>First paint a cage<br>with an open door<br>then paint<br>something pretty<br>something simple<br>something beautiful<br>something useful<br>for the bird \u2026</p> <p>Before she even finishes this <a href=\"http://thebluelantern.blogspot.co.uk/2011/02/to-paint-portrait-of-bird.html\">beautiful little poem</a> we're firm friends, swiftly united in subverting our routine as much as possible. Just as the nurses are putting everyone to bed, she sneaks in and disconnects my catheter from the night bag so we can go and watch GB's Olympic football team play Brazil. The match is uncompetitive, sterile and meaningless but here, all the aspects of the BBC's football coverage that usually induce apoplexy, particularly <a href=\"http://www.chrisrand.com/hmhb/look-dad-no-tunes-ep/lock-up-your-mountain-bikes/\">Garth Crooks's endless banalities</a>, are strangely soothing, and I go to bed far happier than when I rose, having requested sleeping pills well in advance.</p> <p>I sleep deeply for four hours, then wake, fixated upon the question of inequality. Gradually realising that I'm in no fit state to resolve this longstanding problem, it takes time to settle back down. I take them again the following night, and something similar happens: I rise with this singular sensation of disconnect from my body. At 3.30am I go to the day room to read. Billie joins me and we watch more football together.</p> <p>Soon, I weep again, through tiredness and pain. I venture out into the garden for the first time. Just seeing London life \u2013 a tower block, a single car and pedestrian \u2013 makes me realise that soon I'll be out, with the pain subsiding, and this and the fresh air makes me feel infinitely better. That night I meet Katya, who'll be having her operation tomorrow, and I tell her that although she'll be sore, she'll be fine if she asks for sleeping pills and gets friends to sneak in food, and that the joy at resolving her <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Gender-dysphoria/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">gender dysphoria</a> will make it all worthwhile, as it has for me.</p> <h2>Departure</h2> <p>As soon as I wake on Monday, I ask the nurse when the packing and the catheter will be removed. \"After breakfast,\" she replies. Suddenly, I've never wanted tea, toast and cereal so much. When it comes, I eat voraciously, impatient for her to return. Eventually, she does: the removal is traumatic, taking longer than anticipated, and seeing the blood-soaked gauze makes me hyperventilate again. She cools me by saying I can shower and wash my hair, and that if I relieve myself efficiently, I'll be discharged tomorrow. Later, I manage to pee: it goes everywhere, but that'll fix itself, and the discomfort is outweighed by knowing that I'm a massive step closer to leaving. My morale is boosted further as I put on my own clothes.</p> <p>I start dilating, using lubricating jelly and two five-inch dilators, one two inches wide, the other three. I have to use the smaller one for five minutes, then the larger for 20, to keep the neovagina open, three times daily for now. (In Scotland I met someone who was down to once a month, three years post-SRS.) This is very dull, and I make it tolerable by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZHOjfIxqk\">listening to music</a>. It goes fine, so there's just one final barrier to my exit: I need to open my bowels. On Monday night, after I've ducked across the road get takeaway pizza, the first time I've left the hospital grounds, the nurse gives me laxatives, and I prepare for the most important dump of my life.</p> <p>You don't need me to describe this \u2013 I couldn't top the <a href=\"http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/jod/ulysses/ulys4.txt\">toilet scene in Ulysses</a> and even if you've not read it, you know what it's like \u2013 but later I triumphantly tell the nurses that I've done the business, and they say I can go now if I wish. I call my parents, my housemate Helen and others, deciding not to leave in a rush.</p> <p>This proves wise as Manjit, who's not back until morning, must see me dilate. She's satisfied that I do it properly, and now the only thing keeping me is the wait for the pharmacy to send my medication. Helen comes to help me home: I'm overjoyed to see her, and we chat for an hour before my painkillers and taxi arrive. </p> <p>When the car pulls up at my house I drag my suitcases inside before collapsing on to my bed, overwhelmed by the simple pleasure of seeing my own home.</p>",
  "<p>The evil wizard Malvel is dead, but the kingdom of Avantia is in danger again - this time from Malvel's evil son, Maximus. Maximus steals the two golden gauntlets.

  "<p>At a time when parish and town councils want to move the new localism agenda forward by taking more control over public services, it may come as a surprise to learn that their efforts are being hampered by arcane legislation from the 19th century.</p> <p>All 9,000 parish and town councils have to adhere to financial payment rules set out in the 1894 Local Government Act, which requires the signatures of two members of the council on every payment or cheque. Hardly a fine example of modern 21st-century local government. Fortunately, the government appears to be moving to change this frustrating situation.</p> <p>The National Association of Local Councils (NALC) has waged a decade-long campaign, with successive governments, to change this historic oddity. We want parish and town councils to be able to carry out electronic banking and modernise the way they make payments in the same way as other parts of the public sector: the 1972 Local Government Act allowed other tiers of local government to make their own arrangements for the proper administration of their financial affairs.</p> <p>Town and parish activities fall into three main areas: representing the local community, delivering services to meet local needs, and striving to improve quality of life and community wellbeing. If they are to be placed at the heart of localism, finding new ways of connecting communities to the levers of power, then surely it makes sense that they should be freed of outdated legislation that prevents them working efficiently and effectively?</p> <p>The use of cheques is declining fast. They made up just 3% of UK payments in 2010 \u2013 a 59% decline since the start of the century. The two-signature rule also adds to the costs of businesses and other public bodies that receive cheques from local councils.</p> <p>It is time for a change, and it appears the coalition government is finally going to do something about this anomaly. It has issued a consultation on a legislative reform order, which could make the changes that NALC has been calling for.</p> <p>However, this change should not be dictated from Westminster. There should be a flexible approach, allowing town and parish councils to choose the payment methods that suit them. Some are likely to continue with the tried and tested process of two signatures, but the majority will move to new electronic systems.</p> <p>Proper safeguards will be necessary and normal banking arrangements now allow for remote approval of payments. Local councils will hopefully shortly be in a position to work towards the abolition of cheques for all payments.</p> <p>This reform has been on the agenda for many years and finally the government is listening to us. We expect local councils to express strong support for these proposals. This is an important step forward in reforming the many outdated rules that prevent local councils operating in modern and efficient ways.</p> <p><em>Alan Jones is head of communications for the </em><a href=\"http://www.nalc.gov.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>National Association of Local Councils</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and </strong><a href=\"http://localgovernmentjobs.guardian.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>the latest job vacancies</strong></a><strong> direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>Five Australian soldiers have died in southern Afghanistan over the last 24 hours, a toll Australia's prime minister described as the country's worst combat losses in nearly half a century.</p> <p>Three soldiers were shot dead in southern Uruzgan province by an Afghan army soldier who turned his gun on them as they were relaxing at their base late on Wednesday evening. Two others died in a helicopter crash in neighbouring Helmand province in the early hours of Thursday morning.</p> <p>\"I believe this is the most losses in combat since the days of the Vietnam war and the battle on Long Tan,\" said Prime Minister Julia Gillard. In that 1966 battle, 18 Australians were killed.</p> <p>\"This is news so truly shocking that it's going to feel for many Australians like a physical blow,\" she said.</p> <p>Gillard said she would be heading home early from a conference of Pacific nation leaders she was attending in the Cook Islands, the Australian Associated Press reported.</p> <p>The Afghan soldier who turned on his Australian comrades-in-arms shot them at close range with an automatic weapon, killing three and wounding two, said Air Marshal Mark Binskin, vice-chief of the Australian Defence Force.</p> <p>Troops on the scene returned fire, but the shooter managed to scale a fence and escape from the base, Binskin said. Australian and Afghan soldiers were hunting for him.</p> <p>It was the latest in a growing number of insider attacks by Afghan police and soldiers on the foreign troops training them or fighting beside them; 45 people have been killed this year to date, compared to 35 in the whole of 2011.</p> <p>Afghan and Nato commanders are struggling to find ways to prevent the attacks, which are undermining the training mission at the heart of the international vision for long-term support of Afghanistan.</p> <p>Last year, four Australian soldiers died at the hands of their allies, although the majority of casualties have come from the US.</p> <p>Australia makes the largest contribution to the Afghan mission of any nation outside the Nato alliance, with 1,550 troops on the ground.

  "<p>A bail hearing for a Pakistani Christian girl charged with blasphemy has been delayed after her accuser's lawyer challenged a medical report declaring her a juvenile.</p> <p>Rimsha Masih's chances of being granted bail at the hearing on Thursday had appeared hopeful after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/28/pakistan-christian-blasphemy-girl-quran\" title=\"\">a medical report earlier this week found she was aged around 14</a> and should therefore be tried as a juvenile, which would allow her bail in a blasphemy case.</p> <p>But those hopes were dashed when Rao Abdur Raheem, a new lawyer representing the girl's accuser, questioned the medical evidence. Raheem said doctors had gone beyond their remit by commenting on the girl's mental development and claimed that a medical examination was carried out before a court had requested it.</p> <p>The court asked the authorities for clarification of the report and the case will be heard again on Saturday.</p> <p>The medical report had found that Rimsha's mental development was below her age. This could be crucial as a blasphemy conviction requires that she was aware of what she was doing. Establishing that she is a juvenile will also bolster her defence.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/19/pakistan-christian-tensions-quran-burning-allegations\" title=\"\">Rimsha was arrested earlier this month after a neighbour accused her of burning and desecrating pages of the Qur'an</a>. Her parents say she is 11 and has learning difficulties.</p> <p>The case has caused an international outcry, while there are real fears for her safety and the safety of her family. A blasphemy allegation, proven or not, often leads to a death sentence for the accused as vigilantes take the law into their own hands.</p> <p>\"This [medical] report has been managed by the state, state agencies and the accused,\" claimed Raheem, speaking after the brief court hearing in Islamabad. \"We will not allow people to get away with burning the Qur'an.\"</p>",
  "<p>With dizzying speed, over the past few days, the outsourcing group Mouchel teetered, went bust and will now be majority-owned by its creditors<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2012/aug/01/mouchel-restructuring-investors\" title=\"\"> through an \u00a387m debt for equity deal</a>.</p> <p>Since those creditors include Royal Bank of Scotland, we now have a situation where local services are being provided to the residents of, for example, Middlesbrough, Lincolnshire and Bournemouth, by a part-nationalised company (<a href=\"http://www.localgov.co.uk/index.cfm?method=news.detail&amp;id=106716\" title=\"\">the latter facing calls to bring its workforce back in house</a>).</p> <p>Mouchel claims that despite its near-death experience it's \"business as usual\" for the company. But it can't and shouldn't be. What the collapse of this company shows is that outsourcing isn't a clean cut. Local authorities and other public bodies can't just sign a contract and walk away in the expectation the service will be seamlessly provided.</p> <p>Before and after contracting, public bodies ought not just to do what the lawyers call due diligence and assess the financial viability of the contractor, but maintain the utmost vigilance over their business affairs.</p> <p>Take Mouchel. Once upon a time, the company bearing this name was a straightforward engineering specialist, helping build the Royal Liver Building and Battersea Power Station.</p> <p>Then, a decade ago it merged with another former engineering outfit called Parkman. Mouchel Parkman start popping up as a generic supplier of maintenance and repairs to social landlords and councils, working in schools and elsewhere. In 2007 they took over Hyder Business Services (formerly owned by Terra Firma, it had major problems with a Bedfordshire outsourcing contract) then rebranded as Mouchel. After falling into difficulties (including a <a href=\"http://www.localgov.co.uk/index.cfm?method=news.detail&amp;id=97415\" title=\"\">law suit with Westminster city council over a parking contract</a>), the company next faces takeover by VT Group (former the shipbuilder Vosper Thorneycroft \u2013 now itself taken over by Babcock), and by Costain (another builder become 'service supplier').</p> <p>How far could public bodies buying Mouchel services ever keep up with this whirligig of corporate restructuring? What could they do when, last December, <a href=\"http://www.localgov.co.uk/index.cfm?method=news.detail&amp;id=104275\" title=\"\">Mouchel announced a \u00a365m loss</a>, knowing that the resulting turmoil was bound to affect the quality of service offered locally by the firm.</p> <p>Public bodies are often na\u00efve about business. Here's John Beesley, the Tory leader of Bournemouth, welcoming the banks' takeover of Mouchel: \"It removes the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company\". On the contrary, the banks are likely either to try to exit very quickly or dismember the company to minimise their potential losses.</p> <p>Another example. After the Olympic security debacle, any responsible police authority would think hard about the capacity of G4S to deliver. But shouldn't they also examine that company's finances? Read the Guardian's Nils Pratley and ponder <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2012/aug/28/g4s-meltdown-olympics-contracts\" title=\"\">his conclusion that G4S is \"running out of steam</a>\".</p> <p>How many public bodies buying G4S services were even aware of its recent attempt to take over the Danish company ISS \u2013 a decision (some analysts say) that if consummated would have been akin to the disastrous capture of Dutch banking group ABN-Amro by RBS, just before its collapse?</p> <p>A prime lesson from the Private Finance Initiative is that companies will engage in complex financial engineering in order to reduce their borrowing costs, inflating the profits. The Jimmy Reid Foundation, a new Scottish thinktank, has been doing some work on the privatised utility companies. Ofwat and other regulators allow price rises based on one estimate of the cost of capital;<a href=\"http://reidfoundation.org/portfolio/excessive-profits-and-overcharging-multiple-errors-in-the-uk%E2%80%99s-model-for-setting-utility-prices/\" title=\"\"> the companies then find ways of lessening their borrowing costs and their profits rise accordingly</a>.</p> <p>The moral of this has to be: eternal vigilance by public bodies over private companies motivated by profit maximisation. But do councils and civil servants have enough financial expertise to know what's happening? Are they capable of becoming part-time stock analysts?</p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The amazing euro crisis continues \u2013 another meeting, another non-decision. You might have imagined that, like a brick being tugged with a piece of elastic, something would have happened by now.</p> <p>But no, the euro, it seems, is stuck in a political no man's land \u2013 trapped between two opposing world views. And the battleground is not economics, but ethics.</p> <p>Thus, the ongoing debate about pooling of debt founders less on practicalities than the categorical imperative that those who have been careful with their budgets should not have to help those who have been careless.</p> <p>And while the Spanish and Greeks insist that there is a moral obligation on the part of the wealthy countries to help them over bad times, the Germans and Dutch fume at the idea that work-shy, tax-evading grasshoppers with unregistered swimming pools should be bailed out by their dutiful ants.</p> <p>In the background there is the spectre of <a href=\"http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/bankers-ramp.htm\" title=\"\">banks busily gouging savings (via the central banks) out of the taxpayers for easy profits</a>. It is the 'unfairness' rather than the technicalities that are the sticking point in dealing with the euro imbroglio.</p> <p>The former ECB chief economist, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-26/greece-cheated-to-join-euro-sanctions-since-were-too-soft-issing-says.html\" title=\"\">Otmar Issing, illustrates the blockage by declaring bluntly</a>: \"Greece cheated to get in, and it's difficult to know how we should deal with cheats.\" Certainly, nowadays Greece freely admits it fiddled the figures to enter the currency bloc, claiming its deficit was less than 1% of GDP, whereas even in the boom years, its budget disregarded the 3% limit. This is a country rated by Transparency International as the most corrupt in Europe and top of the table for tax evasion.</p> <p>The media have merrily fanned the flames. A satirical picture for a German magazine caused outrage in Athens. The Venus de Milo (considered by the Greeks to be part of their looted heritage) \u2013 was depicted making a rude gesture, with the caption: \"Cheats in the euro family\". In response, a Greek daily mashed up a photo depicting the statue atop Berlin's Column of Victory holding up a swastika.</p> <p>In similar nasty vein, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/throw-out-cheating-greece-before-the-rot-cripples-rest-of-the-world-20110914-1k9lp.html#ixzz24BvuSr60\" title=\"\">Paul Sheehan, a columnist for the Sydney Morning Herald</a>, has called Greece \"a cancer in the eurozone\", one where cheating is the national sport. There are a lot of Greeks in Australia and Melbourne is the third largest \"Greek city\" the world. But that's Melbourne, not Sydney, and Melbourne has its own paper.</p> <p>On the other side of the euro divide, foolish talk grows of Greece and its fellow peripheral nations being \"systematically raped by Germany and France\". The mayor of Athens demands that Germany should now pay \u20ac70bn (\u00a355bn) for two civilian massacres by its soldiers during the war, while the country's deputy prime minister told the BBC that Germany also owed Greece for stealing its gold, a point reinforced by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNWI9_PlM7s\" title=\"\">Daniel Cohn-Bendit in a special appearance on YouTube</a>.</p> <p>Of course this is empty, if increasingly popular, rhetoric. To enable Europe to emerge from the ashes of the second world war, the Marshall Plan wisely put a block on competing national claims, including almost all wartime clearing debt. Yet now that Germany is rich, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2012/06/economic-history\" title=\"\">the call goes up for a re-opening of old debt issues</a>.</p> <p>And even as Greece's supporters hurl angry accusations at the 'Nazis', the reality is some \u20ac100bn of Greek wealth has recently flowed out of the country (depleting its cash-strapped banking system), while the ECB is keeping it afloat by buying zombie bonds. Actually, Greek external debt remains a rather modest \u20ac38,000 or so per person, rather less than either Germany or France's, let alone the UK's whacking \u20ac117,000. It's just the puny Greek GDP that makes it stand out.</p> <p>The eurozone debt problem remains comparable with that of the US, and potentially manageable. Alas, since its inception in the 1950s, the European project has been hostage to the competing views of governments all resolutely set on advancing national interests at the expense of their partners. If the commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, now tries to speak for 'the common interest', such talk is barely audible in the Hobbesian jungle of EU politicking.</p> <p>The bottom line is that governments and citizens in the relatively prosperous northern nations can borrow easily and cheaply, too easily and too cheaply, while fellow Europeans in the troubled nations are paying much higher interest rates that are strangling their economies. That's not only unfair, it's economic madness.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Martin Cohen is a writer on philosophy, social science and green economics.

  "<p>In the days before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781408808870/the-finkler-question\" title=\"\"><em>The Finkler Question</em></a> won the 2010 Man Booker prize, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/howard-jacobson\" title=\"\">Howard Jacobson</a> enthusiasts tended to cast him as an under-appreciated outsider. It wasn't quite true \u2013 he had been published by top literary imprints for nearly 30 years \u2013 but it was a nice rhetorical position, offering a neat explanation of their man's failure to hit the big time. The pale, bloodless guardians of the English novel, so the argument went, simply couldn't cope with his comedy, his rumbustiousness, his Jewishness, his pungent, balls-out assaults on good taste.</p> <p>Now the game's up on all that. Jacobson has, as he puts it, been \"discovered\". His latest novel, <em>Zoo Time</em>, comes stripped of all outsider glamour, splattered with praise from the great and good, and accompanied by grandiose claims: he is arguably \"the greatest novelist working in Britain today\", and so on. You could make a plausible case that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780099501367/kalooki-nights\" title=\"\"><em>Kalooki Nights</em></a> (2006) \u2013 probably his best novel, about a gassing in a Manchester suburb \u2013 is a neglected masterpiece (though I wouldn't want to make it myself). A few eyebrows were raised when <em>The Finkler Question</em>, dealing with antisemitism and philo-semitism among metropolitan types, won the Booker, but it just about supported the weight of Jacobson's newly acquired eminence. With <em>Zoo Time</em>, I suspect, he's due for a backlash. Jacobson has many talents \u2013 as a rhetorician, a mud-slinger, a purveyor of fine phrases and sprightly patter, as an indefatigable singer of the song of himself. But is he a great novelist, or even a good one?</p> <p><em>Zoo Time</em> conforms closely to the classic recipe for a Howard Jacobson novel. Take a childless, Jewish middle-aged man, born in Manchester or thereabouts, now living in London pursuing a profession not unlike the author's: in the past, we've had columnists, cartoonists and academics; this time, he's a novelist, Guy Ableman. Give him ungovernable romantic urges and a powerful but embattled sense of self-worth: Guy, whose first novel stars a zoo keeper and her lustful monkeys, describes himself as \"a man ruled by pointless ambition and a blazing red penis\". Throw in some marital difficulties and outr\u00e9 sexual enthusiasms: this one briefly covers the classic Jacobson kinks \u2013 shoe fetishism, oedipal fantasy, and the powerful desire to be cuckolded \u2013 but focuses chiefly on Guy's wish to bed his mother-in-law. Add some agitated discussion of Jewish identity. Then stir it all up with a lot of discourse, and of discourse about discourse. Ensure that the plot is minimal, and largely circular. And there it is, the distinctive feel of Jacobson's work \u2013 like being trapped in a confined space with a particularly garrulous pervert.</p> <p>Jacobson is a highly self-conscious writer, and the reader's possible objections to all this feature heavily in this story. Guy's wife and friends complain that he only ever writes about himself; various women accuse him of misogyny, and say that they can't \"identify\" with his characters. As it goes along, <em>Zoo Time</em> argues with you about why you're not enjoying it. Yes, it has little plot, but \"only a moron could be interested in plot\". Garrulous perverts not to your taste? Well, remember that \"devilish, existential blasphemers\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/henry-miller\" title=\"\">Henry Miller</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/dh-lawrence\" title=\"\">DH Lawrence</a>, C\u00e9line \u2013 wrote many of the greatest 20th-century novels. And if you worry that all this sounds a bit navel-gazing, Jacobson has got there first, and is making defensive jokes about it: \"And this is when you know you're in deep shit as a writer \u2013 when the heroes of your novels are novelists worrying that the heroes of their novels are novelists who know they're in deep shit.\"</p> <p>What is odd about Jacobson is the combination of existential blasphemy with a particular strain of broad English comedy. Again, he is well aware of this: when described as \"the English Philip Roth\", he likes to call himself \"the Jewish Jane Austen\". But that's wide of the mark. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/kingsleyamis\" title=\"\">Kingsley Amis</a> or even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/tom-sharpe\" title=\"\">Tom Sharpe</a> would be more accurate, coexisting uneasily with the intensity of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/philiproth\" title=\"\">Roth</a> in his raging and obscene mode: <em>Portnoy's Complaint</em> and <em>Sabbath's Theatre</em>, in their different ways, cast very long shadows over his work. And though Jacobson rails against the mechanical mystery and whodunit plot, he's actually fairly straitjacketed by plot conventions himself. Comedy's requirement for silly symmetries and hilarious incidents is often the only force driving this book forward. Much of the comedy is effortful, failing to rise above this level of contrived mishearing:</p> <p>He even reeled off a sentence from each of my first two novels.</p> <p>\"Those were your plays,\" he said.</p> <p>I stared at him. \"My plays? I've never written a play.\"</p> <p>He laughed again, a basso profundo laugh from far in and deep down. Clearly he found me a riot. \"Days. Those were the days.\"</p> <p>The killer for<em> Zoo Time </em>is that Jacobson has a limited talent for invention, and certainly very little inclination for it. As with many authors possessed of a powerful voice, it tends to crowd out everything else in the novel: \"A writer such as I am feels he's been away from the first person for too long if a third-person narrative goes on for more than two paragraphs \u2026\" Guy's every passing thought is generously and sometimes brilliantly transcribed, but otherwise Jacobson seems to have no idea what to do with his stick people, who couple and uncouple, turn gay or Hasidic, to no discernible pattern.</p> <p>Meanwhile, he rants and rages about the decline of the novel, about \"Oxfam, Amazon, eBooks, iPads, <em>Oprah</em>, apps, Richard and Judy, Facebook \u2026 the graphic novel, Kindle, vampirism\", about Swedish detective novels and misery memoirs, about the loss of \"the idea of the book as prestigious object, source of wisdom, and impious disturbance\". The satirical argument seems either obvious or obviously wrong. The idea of the novel as prestigious object, impious disturbance and so on, is alive and well. If it wasn't, why would anyone publish <em>Zoo Time</em>?</p>",
  "<p>How many civil servants does it take to run the country?</p> <p>This is a question the government has tried to avoid answering directly. Sir Bob Kerslake, the head of the civil service, <a href=\"http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/reform/facebook-twitter\" title=\"\">told civil servants in June</a> that the civil service \"will be significantly smaller in future\". By 2015, there are expected to be 380,000 civil servants, down from 440,000.</p> <p>Proponents of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/12/will-hutton-economy-coalition-capitalism?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">\"hollowed-out state\"</a> would like to see those figures fall even further and debate has raged since the publication of the civil service reform plan of the optimum size for central government.</p> <p>A recent take on the whole question came from Oliver Morley, chief executive of the National Archives, and his colleagues <a href=\"http://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/uk-government-did-we-rule-the-empire-with-4000-civil-servants/#.UCptL2TaDwo.twitter\" title=\"\">who have examined </a>the idea, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9269823/The-Civil-Service-comes-under-fire-from-the-Coalition-but-bashing-the-bureaucrats-can-only-backfire.html\" title=\"\">apparently emanating</a> from former Downing Street adviser Steve Hilton, that at the height of empire, the UK government ran everything with 4,000 people.</p> <p>The team's careful examination of the definition of public officials in the early and mid-19th century highlights the fact that British rule was effected mainly through a small number of British officials working with local elites, who did most of the day to day governing \u2013 the empire's version of outsourcing, perhaps.</p> <p>Morley and his team conclude, however, that taking into account the number of civil servants who did not work in Whitehall, the number of people running the empire at the turn of the 19th century is likely to have been closer to 40,000 than 4,000.</p> <p>This research illustrates, yet again, the tendency of the government and supporters of a smaller state to focus on numbers and statistics, rather than on the reality of what it's like to run an administration.</p> <p>As one blogger recently <a href=\"http://flipchartfairytales.wordpress.com/2012/06/22/should-civil-servants-be-ranked-and-yanked/\" title=\"\">noted</a>, these kinds of statements help to reinforce the notion that the civil service is hugely overstaffed and full of time-serving jobsworths who don't really do much and that, therefore, lots of them need to be sacked.</p> <p>But a better question might be how many disgruntled civil servants it takes to run the country. The departure of so many permanent secretaries from Whitehall is one sign that all is not well; and underneath the top echelons are layers of unhappy civil servants. As one commentator puts it, the civil service is \"full of disheartened, under-valued people in the third year of a pay freeze, who are struggling to keep going\".</p> <p>Wendy Bradley, a former civil servant at HM Revenue &amp; Customs, who left Whitehall in March, agrees. She says many civil servants have been driven out by \"years of government contempt for civil servants, compounded by the coalition's pay freeze and pensions raid\".</p> <p>The government acknowledges the need to increase professional skills across the civil service. But it appears not to acknowledge that its own actions are driving out specialist talent at all levels. Another former senior civil servant decries a change in culture within Whitehall, from an organisation that used to provide a \"phenomenal amount of combined wisdom and experience\" to a place with \"a much more regimented, not to say monolithic set of expectations\".</p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>What a nifty idea: a camera with full mobile connectivity which runs a mobile OS. Or is it?</p> <p>Samsung unveiled its Galaxy Camera at a photogenic event ahead of IFA in Berlin on Wednesday. But is it a smallish tablet with a reasonable camera attached, a chunky mobile with a reasonable camera attached, or a reasonable camera with added mobile connectivity?</p> <p>It's two of those three things. And on paper, it is a really good idea \u2013 a logical evolution of the cameraphone that we've come to know and love.</p> <p>On paper, the specs are pretty good: 16.3 megapixels, a 21x optical zoom, a beautifully sharp, rich and clear screen (308ppi, 4.77in), all the flavours of connectivity you can imagine (3G and Wi-Fi or 4G and Wi-Fi), a 1.4GHz quad-core processor, 8GB of storage plus a slot for micro SD cards, Android Jelly Bean \u2013 and, of course, the ability to record video to your heart's content.</p> <p>On top of that, Samsung has added all kinds of software smarts to make taking, editing and sharing photographs as easy as possible: you can tag and organise them into folders on the fly (no need to wait until you're at a computer); you can upload your images or movies to Samsung's cloud service and you can share them directly with other Samsung devices, including the Galaxy S3 and the new Samsung Note II.</p> <p>The camera (or is it a phone?) doesn't stint on the help with actually taking pictures, either. If you know what you're doing, you can have complete control over the shutter speed, ISO and so on. If you're more of a set-the-mode-and-shoot snapper, there are plenty of modes to choose from.</p> <p>From the front, it certainly looks like a camera: a long lens whirrs out and there's a chunky handgrip. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395401522\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346313806200/Samsung-Galaxy-Camera-004.jpg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Camera\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rear view of the Samsung Galaxy Camera</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Turn it over, though, and it looks (and feels) like a fat tablet: those who like button and dials on their camera will be disappointed, as all the controls are menu-driven.</p> <p>On the limited evidence of a quick play with it surrounded by hordes of people, it's not the camera for me. I found the menus confusing \u2013 I couldn't work out how to invoke the various modes, never mind save or share a photo.</p> <p>And it's bigger and heavier than I was expecting, tipping the scales at 305g and measuring 128.7mm x 70.8mm x 19.1mm: big in my smallish hands. </p> <p>Having said that, I'm not a regular Android user: someone who uses the OS on their tablet or mobile will doubtless find their way around the menus and modes without too much difficulty.</p> <p>It's certainly an innovative device, one that sets a benchmark for other manufacturers to reach.</p> <p>It also makes a lot of sense: after all, we've been snapping pictures on our phones and quickly sharing them for a while now, and Android certainly has the flexibility and power to bring a great deal of creativity and tweakability to that process. </p> <p>But might it just be a bit too damn clever? Or a bit too much of a hybrid? Do you actually need all the Android functionality on a camera?</p> <p>The answer might well be yes. You may love it. Doubtless the mobile network providers will adore it, as it gives them a whole new way to extract money from you \u2013 even though you can't actually make a standard mobile call on it.</p>",
  "<p>Lawyers for Neil Morrissey have been accused by the Daily Mail of abusing a no win, no fee arrangement by claiming costs of \u00a3130,000 in a case in which the actor got damages of just \u00a315,000.</p> <p>However, the solicitor involved in the case over a libelous article published in 2010 said the allegations are \"absolute rubbish\" and it is the Daily Mail which is abusing the no win, no fee system, which is intended for those that cannot afford the cost of libel actions.</p> <p>Peter Crawford, who acted for Morrissey, added that the fees reflected the amount of work needed to \"extract a suitable retraction\" out of the paper.</p> <p>The publisher of the Daily Mail, Associated Newspapers, cited the lawyer's claim for costs as \"excessive\" and a \"good example of abuse\" of the legal rules, which allow lawyers to take on cases free of charge on condition they get paid if they win under a system of rules known as conditional fee agreements.</p> <p>\"The sum of \u00a3130,000 is a remarkable level of costs in a case in which the defendant admitted liability within a few weeks of proceedings being issued, but is typical of the excessive costs charged by CFA-assisted lawyers in cases against newspapers,\" Associated said in<a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Submission-from-RPC-regarding-Shaw-Morrissey-and-Mouse.pdf\" title=\"\"> a new submission to the Leveson inquiry</a>.</p> <p>After being asked by Leveson to give the background to the Morrissey case, Associated claimed that the solicitors at Stitt &amp; Co, Crawford's law firm, were claiming costs which included success fees of \u00a334,000 and \u00a317,000 for a barrister who offered behind the scenes advice as the case was settled out of court.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/12/daily-mail-neil-morrissey-damages\" title=\"\">Men Behaving Badly star received an apology and the previously undisclosed damages of \u00a315,000 in January</a> this year in relation to an article published in 2010 which wrongly claimed he was banned from a French bar for \"rowdy, drunken behaviour\". The paper later admitted to Morrissey it could not stand up the story.</p> <p>Proceedings for libel were issued in June 2011 and six weeks later Associated capitulated according to the publisher's own chronicle of events, made public for the first time in its latest Leveson submission.</p> <p>According to the Associated submission, Morrissey offered to accept damages of \u00a345,000 but the Mail offered \u00a310,000. The actor then sought \u00a330,000 and finally agreed to \u00a315,000 from the publisher on 2 December 2011 and got permission to make a unilateral statement in open court.</p> <p>However, Crawford dismissed the claim that the fees his firm charged were excessive.</p> <p>\"The costs were properly incurred and charged at appropriate rates. The success fee reflected the risk of the litigation. They [the costs] would have been lower had the Mail conceded the allegations were untrue and defamatory at an earlier stage,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It proved extremely difficult to extract a suitable retraction and a sufficient apology from the Mail. It's the Mail abusing the system by relying on the offer of amends procedure as a way of halving the damages that would otherwise have been payable to an individual who was seriously defamed.\"</p> <p>He said Morrissey could not have afforded to take the Mail on were it not for the CFA system. Three years ago the TV star entered an individual voluntary agreement to help him repay debts of \u00a32.5m he had racked up after investing in property, including a hotel in Wales.</p> <p>Associated and other newspaper groups have criticised the increased use of no win, no fee arrangements.</p> <p>Earlier this year the former Times legal manager <a href=\"http://www.legalweek.com/legal-week/blog-post/2159746/conditional-fee-agreements-wrong-governments\" title=\"\">Alastair Brett said CFAs do give justice</a> to \"impecunious and middle income claimants\" but they were also a magnet for \"greedy solicitors\", some of whom he claimed doubled their normal hourly rate of \u00a3500.</p> <p>The high fees means that newspapers can face bills of hundreds of thousands of pounds to defend libel actions whether successful or not.</p> <p>In its Leveson submission, the Mail quotes another CFA case of a claimant asking three national newspapers to cough up \u00a3230,000 in legal fees.</p> <p>Lionel Barber, the editor of the Financial Times, also raised the cost of libel when he testified at Leveson in January saying news organisations are \"forced to employ highly expensive barristers and before you know where you are, you've seen \u00a3100,000 plus disappear\".

  "<p>The Gaza strip faces a water crisis that will soon make it \"unliveable\" unless plans for a $500m desalination plant are approved by banks, delegates at a water conference in Stockholm were told this week.</p> <p>Water for the 1.6 million people \u2013 half of them children and two-thirds refugees \u2013 who live in just 365 sq km of land bordering the Mediterranean comes entirely from the shallow coastal aquifer shared between Gaza, Israel and Egypt, which is only partly replenished each year by rainfall. Decades of overpumping and heavy pollution from salts and waste water has left the aquifer highly degraded and in danger of irreparable damage.</p> <p>UN hydrologists say no more than 55 million cubic metres (mcm) of water should be abstracted a year, but present exploitation rates run at around 160mcm. If this continues, says the UN, it could result in the water table dropping to a point where massive sea water intrusion permanently destroys the source within a few years.</p> <p>In addition, the little water available is heavily polluted by nitrates from uncontrolled sewage, and fertilisers from farmlands, making 90% of the water unfit for human consumption. With the Gaza population expected to increase by 500,000 within eight years, and nearly 25% of all illnesses in Gaza water-related, the urgency for countries to put aside differences and address the issue is growing.</p> <p> \"The aquifer could become unusable as early as 2016, with the damage irreversible by 2020. UNEP [the UN Environment Programme] recommends ceasing abstraction immediately as it would otherwise take centuries for the aquifer to recover. Even with remedial action now to cease abstraction, the aquifer will take decades to recover,\" said <a href=\"http://www.unrwa.org/userfiles/file/publications/gaza/Gaza%20in%202020.pdf\" title=\"\">a UN Relief and Works Agency report</a> published this week.</p> <p>The Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) expects demand for fresh water to grow to 260mcm per year by 2020, a 60% increase on current levels of abstraction from the aquifer, the UN report says.</p> <p>\"We are facing a crisis. If we do not address it now, then Gaza will become unliveable,\" said Shaddad Attili, minister and head of the Palestinian water authority <a href=\"http://www.ufmsecretariat.org/en/ufm-presents-the-gaza-desalination-project-at-the-2012-world-water-week-in-stockholm/\" title=\"\">in Stockholm to lobby the Swedish and other Nordic governments</a> during World Water week.</p> <p>Plans for a desalination plant for Gaza have been discussed since 1996, but with water one of the underlying causes of the Israeli-Palestine conflict, political and security issues have always prevented work from starting. Last year the Palestinian water authority submitted new plans to the <a href=\"http://www.ufmsecretariat.org/en/\" title=\"\">Union for the Mediterranean</a>.</p> <p>However, what gives the scheme at least the possibility of success is that the principle of a desalination plant for Gaza is now backed by Israel, all Mediterranean governments, the UN, the EU and key development banks.</p> <p>Desalination may not be the most environmentally suitable solution, \"but it is the only feasible solution of providing a new water supply to meet growing demand,\" said Rafiq Husseini, a water expert at the Union for the Mediterranean, a grouping of 43 countries which this year approved the scheme.</p> <p>Palestinian authorities hope that the plant will be the cornerstone of a larger scheme to provide much needed electricity and clean water for everyone in Gaza. But with desalination being energy intensive, the whole scheme would need a 90MW power plant and cost in the region of $500m.</p> <p>Finance for the scheme is hoped to come from the Islamic Development Bank, which, says Husseini, has verbally pledged half the money, and Europe, via the European Investment Bank, the financial arm of the Eueopean Commission (EC) that invests around \u20ac70bn a year in soft, or cheap loans.</p> <p>\"This is not a risk-free project. There are many political and other issues. It cannot be financed through loans, but needs grant funding. It needs political commitment,\" said a spokesman for the bank, which is advising the Palestinian authority on how to finance the scheme.</p> <p>The next stage, he said, is for the EC to provide \u20ac4m for technical assistance. However, access to water across the region has become highly politicised and regional conflict has stymied all efforts to share it between countries. Water resources have paid a high price as the Middle East region has grown vastly in numbers in the past 50 years.</p> <p>The Dead Sea has dropped 33m and lost two-thirds of its surface area in a few decades, Jordan and Syria have siphoned most of the water off the Jordan river, and Israel maintains control of the water resources in the Golan heights and the West Bank.</p> <p>Jordan, one of the world's most water-scarce countries, has plans to transport water from the Disi aquifer in the south of the country to the capital Amman but this is thought to be hydrologically unsustainable with present population growth. The longer term regional solution is seen in an ambitious plan to link the Red and Dead seas with a pipeline.</p> <p>This, says its advocates, could pump around 2bn m\u00b3 a year of seawater from the Red sea over 200km to the Dead Sea where it would be desalinated and then pumped on to Amman in Jordan. Under present plans, around 800mcm of clean water would be produced, of which 150mcm would be pumped on to Israel.</p> <p>But all water schemes in the Middle East are complex, mostly requiring the elusive consent of several countries \u2013 virtually impossible until the Arab-Israeli conflict has been resolved.</p> <p>The stakes are high, with all major parties now agreed that it makes humanitarian and political sense to build the plant. \"We cannot wait until the conflict is resolved. We need to drink .The issue is not just water for food and drink but for the stability and security of the world,\" said Al Attili.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Shooting: 9am Royal Artillery Barracks</strong></h2> <p>Great Britain have won medals at every Paralympics in which shooting has been included. Deanna Coates has won eight of them, including three golds. The 58-year-old will hope to claim GB's first medal in the standing air rifle final at 12:00. At the other end of the age spectrum look out for 14-year-old Amy Hursthouse.

He became Britain's first visually impaired world champion in 12 years in 2010, and won European gold in 2011.</p> <p><strong>17: </strong>The number of gold medals won by Team GB's cyclists in 2008. Much like their Olympic counter-parts, Team GB's Paralympic cyclists were dominant in Beijing, claiming nine more golds than nearest rivals the United States. Team GB will be hoping for similar success in London this summer.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Day one: 30 August</strong></h2> <p>The opening day of the Paralympic Games and already there are finals galore, 15 of them in the aquatic centre alone. Susannah Rodgers, surprise package of the 2011 IPC European championships, will look to emulate her five gold medals from Berlin in the S7 100m backstroke (heats 10.41am, final 6.50pm) while Jonathan Fox races in the men's S7 100m backstroke (heats 10.31am, final 6.44pm). Natalie Du Toit goes for her 11th Paralympic gold in the S9 100m butterfly (heats 10.53am, final 7.17pm) and the Ukrainian teenager Yevheniy Bohodayko looks to make an impression in his first Games in the S6 100m backstroke (heats 9.30am, final 5.30pm). Also, world and European 60kg judo champion Ben Quilter is in action (from 11am) and Sarah Storey goes for gold in the velodrome in the C5 pursuit (quals 10.40am, final 4.50pm).</p> <h2>Archery</h2> <p>10:00 Men's Individual Recurve -

  "<p>This week on the network <a href=\"http://nfpsynergy.net/\" title=\"\">nfpSynergy </a>founder and experienced fundraiser, Joe Saxton, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/voluntary-sector-network/2012/aug/17/voluntary-professionals-time-off-in-lieu\" title=\"\">wrote that:</a></p> <p><em>\"Members of staff in charities, particularly those in senior positions, who aren't prepared to give their time above their contracted hours [...] should question why they are working for a charity.\" </em></p> <p>The article, which suggested that the amount of TOIL voluntary sector professionals acrue is problematic for the sector, has been controversial. Many of you have commented, emailed and<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/voluntary-sector-network/poll/2012/aug/23/time-off-lieu-good-for-charities\" title=\"\"> taken part in our poll</a>, and 86% of you voted that hard working professionals, from whatever sector, need a good work-life balance and are entitled to take time off in lieu.</p> <h2>Below are some of your thoughts:</h2> <p><strong>Maureen Nickson, </strong><a href=\"http://www.debra.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Debra</strong></a><strong>: </strong></p> <p>I agree with Joe, TOIL is part of the charity sector culture. As senior managers we are paid to get the job done, no matter what it takes. Although it is important to have a good work-life balance, going that extra mile makes a difference and not only gets results but gives you a feel good factor, which motivates both you and your team.</p> <p><strong>David Sidonio, </strong><a href=\"http://www.richmondcvs.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Richmond Council for Voluntary Service</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p> <p>I once took over as chief executive where employees' approach to TOIL was creative, to say the least. Staff would be off for weeks at a time, claiming two, three or more weeks' worth of 'TOIL' as annual leave. It was of course a complete nightmare and I ended the practice pretty swiftly. I have introduced a TOIL policy into the organisations I manage which keeps things under control and recognises occasions when staff may have to work outside of contracted hours. However, for senior managers, claiming hours worked back should not go with the territory of the job. Instead, an element of flexibility should be in place to juggle busy lifestyles.</p> <p><strong>Laura Conrad, </strong><a href=\"http://www.barnsleyhospice.org/home.aspx\" title=\"\"><strong>Barnsley Hospice</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p> <p>I work for a charity because it is a job. It pays my bills, my rent and for a few meals out. I also work for a charity because I like its ethos and its values. I like how so many charities were inspired by the hopes and dreams of the communities they serve and how, for the most part, that community spirit lives on. What I also like about where I work is that it understands the concept of hard work and that, like most relationships, it requires a bit of give and take.You can work in the third sector because you support and hold dear the charity's mission, vision and values, but not at any cost. I regularly work over my 37.5 hours a week but I don't regularly claim back the time. I work over because the role demands it and I don't want to be seen as failing. When I take time owing I try and add it on to a period of leave \u2013 I take it in half days or leave an hour earlier here and there. But if I work the morning at home, I am still working, just somewhere else. It's on my calendar and I am contactable by phone, web-chat and email.</p> <p>Some salaries in the voluntary sector, particularly outside of the capital and the M25, don't necessarily reflect the late nights and weekends that many staff are expected to work. We can't expect only volunteers to man weekend events if we aren't prepared to do it ourselves. As volunteers they aren't contractually expected to do so. I can't be paid for my overtime and so I claim time back when I feel that it has been excessive.\"</p> <p><strong>David Lacey, </strong><a href=\"http://www.southhamscvs.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>South Hams CVS</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p> <p>When I read this it made my heart beat a little faster and I felt some anger rising inside me. I have worked in this sector on and off for the last 15 years and have often heard similar remarks. They seem innocent enough but there is an undercurrent here that needs challenging. When I work for a charity or community group I am <em>working</em>. That is, I exchange my time, energy and skills for money. I know there are many other things we get from our work and I appreciate those but I do need to eat and pay the rent like everyone else, so eventually it does come down to the money. Many posts in this sector are part time. My post is at the moment so I have another two jobs and volunteer in two organisations outside of the workplace, so my time is fairly tied up.</p> <p>What this means is that my time off is precious. I want to spend time with my wife, daughter and grandchildren and I want to have some energy left over. Trustees and Directors have a duty of care to look after their employees and all of mine do just that. There is no need for me to do extra unpaid work because my role is well designed and well contained. It is not the same as bankers being paid bonuses. Salaries within the sector are fairly low, jobs are often part-time and for short contracts. I am flexible where I can be and of course don't mind working a few extra hours here and there. I believe to work effectively for our charities we need to be adequately compensated within the means of the charity and it must be OK to go home at the end of the day.</p> <p><strong>Anthony Watton,</strong><a href=\"http://www.family-action.org.uk/home.aspx?id=11578\" title=\"\"><strong> Family Action</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p> <p>In our organisation it is expected that managers work some additional hours as part of their role but will not officially build up TOIL. I am a manager and think this is fair - it is for me to manage what hours I do to meet the demands of my job. I think it is fair to allow front line staff the ability to accrue TOIL, so they can be flexible to the needs of our service users.</p> <p><strong>Carl Allen: </strong></p> <p>There is a fierce cacophony for Joe Saxton's head on a platter as retribution for daring to examine the treatment of non-contractual hours worked by professional charity employees. Such treatment includes toil taken, toil donated and overtime payments. Two points draw my attention. Firstly, this cacophony of comments looks to have an unusual and wider significance as the attention of other parties are drawn to both the subject matter and the sector's response. There is the matter of public and donor perceptions of how TOIL is treated by the charity sector in a prolonged climate of increased poverty, high unemployment and austerity. Secondly, Joe's call has unlocked but not opened the door for wider questions about the charity sector: the question of whether TOIL and bonuses substitute for one another and whether bonus payments should be part of the sector culture.</p> <p><strong>Sheryl Roberts,</strong><a href=\"http://www.longley4g.btck.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong> Longley 4G Community Centre</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p> <p>As the only paid member of staff in our organisation I frequently work more than my contracted hours and very rarely get the opportunity to take these hours back. If the organisation I work for had to pay me overtime I am sure they would be more willing to listen to some of the difficulties I face. As I am responsible for generating enough income to maintain the organisation and pay my own wages, I am in a catch 22 situation. If there is no one here then we could miss out on vital business which we rely on for sustainability.</p> <p><strong>Zoe Amar, </strong><a href=\"http://www.lasa.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Lasa</strong></a><strong>: </strong></p> <p>Joe's article doesn't reflect my experience of the TOIL system. At the charity where I work, <a href=\"http://www.lasa.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Lasa</a>, we're a committed team of staff who are always prepared to go the extra mile. And we're all willing to put in additional hours where we need to. In my view, the purpose of the TOIL system is not to let staff accrue lots of extra holiday, as Joe implies. Rather, it helps re-dress the balance where staff have put in extra hours. This principle isn't unique to the TOIL system. Back in the days when I was in the corporate world, if we all worked very late into the night we were allowed to start a little later the next morning. Any sensible employer, whatever sector they are in, will look for ways to help stop their employees from getting burnt out. The TOIL system helps balance the needs of both the employer and the employee.</p> <p>Joe's article raises some interesting questions about how charities measure success and productivity of their employees. In my view, efficiency and outputs are key, especially when so many charities are managing rising demand with limited resources. It's about 'working smart', and this doesn't necessarily equate to being in the office around the clock, which seems to be one of the assumptions that Joe's piece makes. There are so many hard working, passionate staff in the charity sector. Their commitment makes it a truly inspiring place to work. Let's not forget that.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>George Zimmerman scored a significant legal victory on Wednesday night when a Florida appeals court ruled that the judge overseeing his case for the murder of Trayvon Martin must be removed.</p> <p>A panel of senior judges ruled two to one to side with Zimmerman's lawyer Mark O'Mara, who argued that circuit court judge Kenneth Lester was biased against his client for scathing comments he made at an earlier bail hearing.</p> <p>Lester had accused the neighbourhood watch captain of \"manipulating the system to his own benefit\" by failing to declare his wealth from donations to a personal website in order to secure a lower bail amount, then refused to disqualify himself when O'Mara protested.</p> <p>\"While this is admittedly a close call, upon careful review we find that the allegations, taken together, meet the threshold test of legal sufficiency,\" judges Alan Lawson and Jay Cohen, of the fifth district court of appeals, Daytona Beach, wrote in their majority decision granting O'Mara's motion.</p> <p>\"We direct the trial judge to enter an order of disqualification which requests the chief circuit judge to appoint a successor judge.\"</p> <p>It is the second time that Zimmerman, accused of second-degree murder for the shooting of unarmed black teenager Martin in a February confrontation in Sanford, has been granted a new judge.</p> <p>Soon after his arrest in April, judge Jessica Recksiedler stood aside because her husband's legal partner Mark NeJame, a prominent Orlando attorney, was hired by news channel CNN as an expert analyst on the high-profile case.</p> <p>Zimmerman, 28, denies murdering Martin on the grounds of self-defence, and O'Mara has said he will seek a hearing under Florida's stand-your-ground law for the charge to be dismissed.</p> <p>Martin, 17, was the aggressor in the encounter, O'Mara maintains, and broke Zimmerman's nose and slammed his head on to concrete before the defendant drew his gun and shot the teenager once in the torso.</p> <p>The spat with Lester came in June, when prosecutors alleged that Zimmerman hid more than $135,000 in donations to a website he set up to pay for his defence.</p> <p>Zimmerman's wife Shellie, 25, told Lester at a bail hearing that the couple was virtually penniless, convincing the judge to grant bail at $150,000.</p> <p>When Lester was informed of the amount of the donations, he revoked Zimmerman's bail then lambasted him in a written decision that raised the bail amount to $1m.</p> <p>\"Under any definition, the defendant has flaunted the system,\" Lester wrote.</p> <p>\"The evidence is clear the defendant and his wife acted in concert, but primarily at the defendant's direction, to conceal their cash holdings.\"</p> <p>State attorney Bernie de la Rionda told Lester that the Zimmermans frequently transferred large amounts of money between their accounts and that George Zimmerman kept a secret second passport hidden in a bank safety deposit box, making him a flight risk.</p> <p>Shellie Zimmerman was later charged with perjury, and she and her husband remain free on bond.</p> <p>O'Mara, who claims the defence fund is now virtually exhausted, accused Lester of making \"gratuitous, disparaging remarks about Mr Zimmerman\" in documents to the appeals court seeking a writ of prohibition.</p> <p>\"The court has created a reasonable fear in Mr Zimmerman that the trial court is biased against him, and as a result of this prejudice cannot receive a fair and impartial trial,\" he said.</p> <p>Special prosecutor Angela Corey, who charged Zimmerman in April after Sanford police originally set him free in February, had no immediate comment on the appeals court decision.</p> <p>Judge Kerry Evander was the dissenting member of the appeals court panel, arguing that Lester was within his rights to criticise Zimmerman for his conduct.</p> <p>\"Although [Lester] clearly manifested an exceedingly strong belief that Zimmerman had flouted and tried to manipulate the system, I do not believe the order crossed the line so as to require the granting of his motion,\" he wrote.</p> <p>Zimmerman's next court appearance is scheduled for October, although no trial is expected before next year. He faces at least 30 years in jail if convicted.</p>",
  "<p>Never mind the South Africans clogging up the batting order in the England cricket team \u2013 when Johanna Konta shocked everyone but herself by reaching the second round of the US Open and Laura Robson advanced to the third round on day three there must have been a lot of proud Australians smiling to themselves in the middle of the night.</p> <p>Konta was born in Sydney to Hungarian parents and moved to the UK seven years ago, when she was 14; Robson was born to Australian parents in Melbourne 18 years ago and moved to London when she was six.</p> <p>That's probably too long ago in both cases for Australia to claim them \u2013 and although Konta's accent has traces of her background, she says she is proud to have \"GBR next to my name\".</p> <p>Robson's next opponent is Li Na, one of the funniest and most interesting players on the tour. Asked what three things Americans might still not understand about China (where have you been guys?), she said: \"Why Chinese still use chopsticks; why Chinese have to put the family name first, right? &#xa0;I think lot American people couldn't understand, yeah. &#xa0;Two thing already. &#xa0;I couldn't find a third one.\"</p> <h2>The comeback kids</h2> <p>When Janko Tipsarevic and Lleyton Hewitt survived on day three they became the seventh and eighth players at this US Open to win from two sets down, an unusually high number. Unfortunately for Belgium, Xavier Malisse could not make it nine against American Marathon Man John Isner, murdering a regulation backhand volley in the tie-break.</p> <p>Isner, forever to be remembered as Nicolas Mahut's partner in longevity on Court 18 at Wimbledon, has played in 48 tie-breaks this year.</p> <p>When was the last time, incidentally, that three Belgians played on the main court on the same day at Flushing Meadows? Your humble reporter doesn't know but Malisse, Kirsten Flipkens and Kim Clijsters did it on day three. And all lost.</p> <h2>Say no cheese</h2> <p>Being fat in America is easy: have cheese on everything (including cheese), watch a lot of television and you will end up with a waist size bigger than your IQ.</p> <p>Too many kids, here and everywhere, are pretty good at being fat, which is why an initiative spawned by the first lady and encouraged by the United States Tennis Association is to be applauded.</p> <p>That's all well and good. But one way to get people skinny is not to stick a load of fat-making stuff in front of them. Out and about in the food halls at Flushing Meadows the calorie-rich fare still swamps the healthy stuff \u2013 and you do not want to know about the media canteen.</p> <h2>Kim's game over</h2> <p>The departure of Kim Clijsters from the tournament and the game at age 29, after losing to Laura Robson on Wednesday, will leave a big vacuum in the niceness department.</p> <p>She might be the nicest person in women's tennis and does not seem to have an enemy in the game. Robson said she could not allow herself to think about retiring one of the game's legends beforehand and felt guilty when reminded of it afterwards. Did she feel like the girl that shot Bambi? \"I wouldn't go that far,\" she said. \"I would say that was Becker beating Agassi here a few years ago.\"</p> <p>She said of Clijsters: \"I've always loved watching her play because she's such a dynamic player. Her movement is something that I wish I could have. Still, it's great to be through to the third round of a slam for the first time.\"</p> <p>Sentiment is fine. But sport is always about winners and losers.</p> <h2>More Mr Nice Guy</h2> <p>Another amenable character here is Brian Baker, the talented American returning after a long absence through injury. The first time he came here, with his father, he was eight years old. The last time was seven years ago, as a 20-year-old prospect, when he upset the ninth seed Gaston Gaudio.</p> <p>Then he suffered the cruellest run of &#xa0;injuries and had to have three operations on his hip, one on his hip and elbow, as well as a hernia, and did not play again until last summer.</p> <p>The place has changed a little, he says. The changing room is a lot better, and there's a good gym and better cafeteria. As for his own game, he feels stronger and his serve is better.</p> <p>\"Being older, knowing how easy the game was taken away from me, it's very easy to appreciate it a lot. I don't take anything for granted. I remember several years watching it on TV wishing I was here. So just to be here is an awesome feeling.\"</p> <p>But, says Baker, \"I'm not one that's gonna try to be the saviour of US tennis or anything like that. I don't feel like we're doing poorly at all. It's just we're coming off a generation that did so well. The game is so global these days. The top three or four guys in the world are probably one of the top three or four that's ever played.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the first rehearsal for volunteer dancers taking part in the Paralympics opening ceremony, artistic director Jenny Sealey told us our performance would be a reminder to the public that the Paralympics are not second best, not an afterthought, or an add-on to the Olympics.</p> <p>The Games are being brought back home to where they started 64 years ago, she said, and are a huge cause for celebration among the disabled community.</p> <p>Sealey's pep talk with co-director Bradley Hemmings \u2013 no doubt as it did to other groups of the 3,000-strong cast of volunteers \u2013 inspired us through the following 60-plus hours of rehearsals as part of the \"gravity\" section of the opening ceremony.</p> <p>We were talked through the concept of the ceremony in that first rehearsal, but it was only around the time of our dress rehearsals that we began to realise how we fitted into the bigger picture. One thing we were made to understand was that it was less about our five minutes of fame and more about taking part and showing what we could do together on an equal stage \u2013 a running theme of the Paralympics.</p> <p>Standing in a stuffy black warehouse at 3 Mills Studiosclose to the stadium, the early sessions were long and tiresome. Rumours and speculation about our costumes, other sections, and what was in the Olympic opening ceremony \u2013 as well as plenty of granulated tea \u2013 kept spirits high.</p> <p>But then Danny Boyle dropped a bomb, that huge explosive jaw-dropping spectacle, which we all got to see close up after complimentary tickets to the dress rehearsal were given to the Paralympics ceremony cast. As an avid theatre-goer, this was unlike anything I'd ever seen before, and it set a wave of nervousness and excitement rippling through the volunteer performers: how could we ever live up to such a show?</p> <p>Soon after we moved to a disused car park in Dagenham where rehearsing continued through a hot August. My section, including bouncing apples, tandem bikes, wheelchair dancers, rollerskaters and a maze of hedge-like books, took many hours to construct by making regimental lines and corridors to allow those on wheels to pass through the dancers without cutting off toes. The gravity section was between the \"navigation\" and \"empowerment\" sections and it soon became clear the ceremony was to be more philosophical, symbolic, and possibly more emotional than the Olympic opening ceremony. If Danny Boyle'screation was a tribute to Britain, this was going to be a universal celebration of the human mind and body.</p> <p>Channel 4's advertisements in the buildup after the Olympic closing ceremony were a huge help in raising determination among the 400-strong troupe of volunteers that made up my waltzing group. We were spurred on continually by the energies of our dance captains, and our choreographer Kevin Finnan (director of Motionhouse dance theatre company), not forgetting one famous member of our group known as Dancing Dan \u2013 for his ability to keep his limbs pumping to imaginary beats whatever the time or weather.</p> <p>As we moved to the Olympic Stadium the excitement among the performers grew. We swapped the granulated tea and sun cream for lunch packs and plastic ponchos to survive the rain. Soon it was dress rehearsal day and our green Dr Martens footwear arrived \u2013 all the sections were wearing different colours of the British brand \u2013 and we grappled with awkward corsets and scratchy hooped skirts. A small team of seamstresses had to work through the night to reduce dozens of size 16 and 18 corsets to size 10s and 12s when a delivery failed. We practiced the transition between sections. The \"mass performance\" team barked instructions and counts through radios and \"in-ears\" we wore to keep in time and hear our cues.</p> <p>With back-to-back compulsory rehearsals at the stadium, the times of which changed on a daily basis, Facebook friends formed, phone numbers were exchanged and a secret group was set up to discuss the perils of stomping in the blister-inducing DMs in the rain.</p> <p>Since signing a confidentiality agreement to take part, at every rehearsal we were told \"to keep the secret\" and under no circumstances were photographs, Facebook status updates, tweets or even Foursquare check-ins allowed. At first this felt pretty restrictive for a social media journalist \u2013 but after Boyle's ceremony most of us understood why #savethesurprise trended on Twitter on both dress rehearsal nights.</p> <p>The organisers frequently talked about the media in negative tones \u2013 mentioning a Daily Mail spoiler of the closing ceremony. Some of the dancers I'd made friends with knew I worked for the Guardian, and once the story came out about the volunteer tickets I'm pretty sure most people thought I was a mole. As far as I know most of the celebrity appearances were kept under wraps. We were pretty star-struck to find Sir Ian McKellen appear to do a reading just after our section \u2013 he turned up in the rain too, and stayed until midnight of the dress rehearsal to go over the finale.</p> <p>By show day, however, all we could focus on was getting our part right. As a dancer by training, as many others in my section were, it was about creating an awesome stage performance and remembering who the show was for \u2013 the stunning Paralympic athletes. We hope we gave them the opening they deserve.</p>"
