  "<p>Sophie Christiansen has just heard we want to take a photo of her. \"Well I'm not looking very glamorous, am I?\" She looks at Pippa, her publicist/helper/dresser/bodyguard. \"You'll have to help with my hair,\" says the triple gold medal-winning equestrian before manoeuvring herself into her diasability scooter and whizzing across the media lounge.</p> <p>We're at Team GB House, just across the road from the Olympic park, where Britain's medallists come to be feted. As&#xa0;it happens, her friend and fellow equestrian, Natasha Baker, is being interviewed about her second gold medal win. \"Tash!\" Christiansen shouts with delight, and starts singing along to Spandau Ballet's Gold. The interviewer spots Christiansen. \"And I do believe we&#xa0;have Sophie in the house,\" he announces. A huge roar follows. Her face splits into a smile of pure joy.</p> <p>Christiansen is still only 24, and she's a five-time Paralympic gold medallist. \"An old woman!\" she says. Her story is astonishing. She was born two months premature with cerebral palsy. From a desperate start, things got worse. She had a fit and then suffered from jaundice, blood poisoning, and a collapsed lung. Oh, and she had a heart attack. Few expected her to survive.</p> <p>But she didn't just survive, she thrived. By six she was riding horses, and excelling at school. At 16 she won a bronze at the Athens Paralympics in the most disabled category of dressage. In Beijing, at 20, she won two golds and a silver. And now she's topped that.</p> <p>Her body is floppy, her muscles spasm involuntarily, her speech is slurred, and she is utterly lovely \u2013 funny, gobby, brainy, heroic. She tells me about her background \u2013 her teacher parents, younger brother Alex, how they grew up near Ascot. Ah, I say, so that explains the horses. \"No. Pure coincidence. In fact my mum is allergic to horses.\" She pauses. \"I just took it up to annoy her.\" She creases up, laughing. Perhaps the most miraculous thing is that, despite struggling so much to control her body, she has excelled in a sport that is all about perfect control. \"Yes, precision,\" she says, precisely. Dressage is also known as horse ballet \u2013 two-legged and four-legged partner walk and trot to music in perfect time and rhythm.</p> <p>How does she manage it? \"Dressage comes from the French 'dresser', which means to train and that's what it's about; training the horse. So we train my horse to do what he's suppposed to do \u2013 no matter what I'm doing. Rio knows he just has to walk in the correct rhythm and stay relaxed. Sometimes due to my disability I do give the wrong signals, but he's trained to almost ignore that.\"</p> <p>Rio is better known as Janeiro. He has two names \u2013 a formal competition name, and a nickname for intimates. In this Paralympics, the pair have improvised brilliantly with the accompanying music \u2013 as well as Land of Hope and Glory and Pink Floyd, their routine included Big Ben's chimes and a quotation from Shakespeare. \"I'm quite into my music. I&#xa0;go to a lot of gigs.\" What's her favourite piece in the routines? \"Another Brick in the Wall. It was quite ironic because I've got a master's degree in maths.\"</p> <p>Why's that ironic? \"Because it's: 'We don't need no education.' And I used it because I hope the Paralympics will educate people in disability, and also inspire them to go out and achieve their dream, no matter how difficult it is.\"</p> <p>At times, she says, it has been very difficult. Her parents fought for her to go to a mainstream school with a special unit attached. They were absolutely right, too, she says. It gave her the best of both worlds \u2013 support and the chance to integrate. Still, integrating wasn't easy. I&#xa0;tell her that when I was a child I&#xa0;went to a special school, and the able-bodied pupils were horrible to those with cerebral palsy. She nods. \"I think every kid goes through a bit of that, disabled or able-bodied.\" A bit of what? \"A bit of what I suppose you'd call bullying.\"</p> <p>But isn't it different if the bullying is about your cerebral palsy?</p> <p>\"Yes. But I didn't get that much name-calling. Making friends was the most difficult thing for me. I was quite shy because of my speech. Also at lunch I didn't have much time to go out and play because it took me longer to eat. Until GCSEs I didn't have many friends.\"</p> <p>Going to Athens for the Paralympics in 2004 changed everything. She came back, she says, a different person. \"Because I won a bronze medal at such a young age I had to talk to a lot of media, do a lot of interviews, and it really brought me out of myself. I had to become less self-conscious, and after that, at sixth form, I had a great friend.\"</p> <p>Are people with cerebral palsy stereotyped? \"I think we used to be.\" In what way? \"That we'd just stay at home doing nothing. I still get it now.\" She laughs, points her index finger to her head and makes a screw-loose motion. \"Because of my speech people think I'm not all there. Some people come up and start talking through my friend to me, and I&#xa0;am like, 'Excuse me, I am here.' When they think I'm mentally disabled, I&#xa0;try to&#xa0;drop in the conversation that I got a first-class masters degree in maths.\"</p> <p>Was she always a mathematical genius? \"I always liked maths! I&#xa0;wouldn't call myself a genius. It didn't&#xa0;come easy to me. The key is I&#xa0;work very hard in everything I do.\"</p> <p>Has she got a favourite equation? \"Fermat's theorem,\" she answers instantly. \"X<sup>n </sup>+ Y<sup>n</sup> = Z<sup>n</sup>. I like the story behind it. Fermat was a French mathematician from, I think, the 17th century. You may have to check your facts on this. [She's right, of course.] And he claimed to have proved the theorem. He wrote it down in a book that he'd proved it, but no one could actually find his proof, so for centuries mathematicians have been trying to prove it to see whether he actually did prove it. Then a few years ago it was finally proven, by a guy named Andrew Wiles.\"</p> <p>As she explains, I'm staring at the three gold medals around her neck. She looks magnificently bling \u2013 the Liz Taylor of the Paralympics. What does it feel like to wear them all at once? \"Heavy,\" she complains. \"No, it's the most amazing feeling ever. Normally I think I'm just me, I just do what I do. But when everybody else acknowledges it, it comes back that I have achieved something special.\"</p> <p>Isn't it ridiculous winning three golds? Yes, she says, in a way, but that was the target she set herself. \"I knew my horse was capable of it. It was just down to me to get it out of him.\" Who deserves the medal more, her or Rio? \"Half and half. He has been the perfect partner for me. I couldn't have wished for a better horse.\"</p> <p>But they had a tough start, and just being selected for the Paralympics was a&#xa0;struggle. \"Last year, my old horse Rivaldo went lame the day before we were meant to go to the Europeans. A couple of weeks later he got put down. I'd already got Rio a couple of months before as my backup, but then I had to bring him on and form a partnership much quicker than I had intended to.\"</p> <p>Even though she felt she was riding well, the results were disappointing. So she looked at the possible reasons. \"And I think the main thing was that I was so desperate to get to the Paralympics, and my desperation was transferring through to Rio in competition. So I worked really hard with my psychologist.\"</p> <p>And the work paid off. She says she has had the most fantastic few weeks, and has never been involved in anything like this before \u2013 the crowds, the enthusiasm, the way disabled people have been empowered and embraced.</p> <p>What's most surprising, I say, is that this has happened in a city where disabled people are virtually invisible because facilities for them are so poor.</p> <p>She nods, and looks at Pippa. \"I'm not sure if I'm allowed to give my opinion on this, but I'm going to anyway. Public transport has improved with the games because there were so many volunteers around to put out ramps and stuff.\" But she says, normally, it's nothing like this. \"I've been stranded by myself on a train many times with no one \u2026 even if I book it, which you have to do 24 hours in advance. So you can't be spontaneous. People are great, if they see you're stuck anywhere, they'll come and help you.\" But that's people, not systems, I say. \"Yeah, yeah, I'm getting there! But access is horrendous in London, and we're meant to be the world leader in everything. It's rubbish.\" If she were a&#xa0;politician, what would she want to do&#xa0;for disabled people? \"Well, the Paralympics has improved London transport in terms of the number of helpers. But in terms of actual physical access, they haven't done anything. I&#xa0;went to Vienna at New Year and their underground system was amazing. The&#xa0;tube would come up, the platform would level with the carriage and a little ramp would come out of the carriage. It really put London to shame.\"</p> <p>What does she think about the fact that we're celebrating disability, and yet at the same time the government is looking to cut disability benefits? \"From my point of view, I've got a job now [as a statistician]. But&#xa0;getting that job was really difficult. With my first-class masters degree, I&#xa0;wanted to get a high-flying job in the City. And I went to loads of interviews and ended up thinking, this isn't going to work. Firstly, I wouldn't be able to live in London because of access, and secondly, the big companies weren't willing to give me a bit of extra help. For example, I couldn't go on a placement for a week in Edinburgh because I&#xa0;needed to take a carer with me.\"</p> <p>The thing is, she reckons, businesses would gain if they employed more disabled people. \"The general feeling among the employees would be, 'Well, if they can do it, we can too.' So even if I might be slower to do the actual physical job, it would motivate others to do their work.\" So, other workers would say, 'Well if somebody disabled can make a good job of it, so&#xa0;can I'? \"Yes.\" She giggles at her fabulously un-PC theory. \"Well that's my opinion.\" What does she think about&#xa0;the fact that Atos, which sponsors the Paralympics, is also the company the government has appointed to weed out disability claimant fraudsters? Another knowing smile. \"I don't think I can answer that! I don't know a lot about that story.\" Has she come across such cheats? \"No. I&#xa0;haven't seen it.\"</p> <p>Look, she says, the Paralympics have already changed so much,&#xa0;and now it's up to everybody to&#xa0;build on that. \"I'm still in a bit of a bubble. I don't think it will hit me just how much we've affected the nation until I get out of here.\"</p> <p>One thing is for sure, though, she's going to have plenty to occupy her \u2013 the&#xa0;statistician job, training for her next dressage championship, and now campaigning. As Pippa helps her on to her scooter, Christiansen waves a hand at me \u2013 a farewell and a promise.</p> <p>\"I'll be out talking to politicians about all this!\"</p>",
  "<p>As someone who loves to drive, I've long agreed with my fellow ageing car-freak PJ O'Rourke's tersely grouchy opinion of bicycles and, by extension, their riders: \"Bicycles are childish,\" he opined in a 1980s essay, before upping the ante considerably, to \"bicycles are un-American.\"</p> <p>Even O'Rourke, however, might change his curmudgeonly tune upon seeing <strong>Premium Rush</strong>, a very serviceable little bicycle-based thriller, and a kinetic crowd-pleaser possessed of all the honourable B-movie values: tautness and compactness, enough plot to keep you guessing and some impressive stunts and collisions. It also has a time-crunch aspect: bike messenger Joseph Gordon-Levitt must ferry a nondescript envelope across town in 90 minutes, dodging cabbies, pile-ups, and a vicious cop (Michael Shannon) with \"impulse-control issues\".</p> <p>Although it's not strictly speaking a real-time movie, the time-crunch does put one in mind of other no less enjoyable bubblegum thrillers like Speed, Nick Of Time and Phone Booth. That list is also reminiscent of the good choices Gordon-Levitt has made in transition from child star to movie star.</p> <p>He likes B-thrillers and thoughtful dramas. Some of his movies, like The Lookout and Brick, are both, while Mysterious Skin, Stop-Loss and (500) Days Of Summer prove that he either gets the first look at the best scripts, or that he just has excellent taste in projects (much like Michelle Williams). It's nice to see, even as he ascends into superstardom, that between mega-projects like Inception and The Dark Knight Rises, he's happy to squeeze in smaller projects like Premium Rush and 50/50.</p> <p>Compared to a lot of these movies, Premium Rush is like a day-off, a good-time movie for all involved, including, thankfully, the viewer. One link with Speed can be found in Rush's villain, played by Michael Shannon. Shannon's work has always been interesting, from his sexually repressed T-Man in Boardwalk Empire to his Oscar nomination for Revolutionary Road, but here he tries something like menace plus comedy, and the result recalls Dennis Hopper's over-the-top villain in Speed. That's a dubious compliment, I realise, since Shannon is a fine actor and Hopper, to my mind, was a terrible one. But as the only player on screen who's really working up a sweat (as a thespian, that is, not as a cyclist), it's odd that he finally should come off \u2013 as Hopper often did \u2013 so much like one of the guys they pull the masks off at the end of Scooby-Doo.</p> <p>Top-table screenwriter David Koepp directed, and on the basis of this and his creepy ghost thriller Stir Of Echoes, he should write less and direct a lot more, because who really needs Jurassic Park 4? In the meantime, though, bicycles just became marginally less childish and un-American.</p>",

In An Adventure With Scientists!</strong></a></h2> <p>People bang on about how great Pixar are, but often ignore that with Aardman the UK has an animation studio that equals it in talent, scope and quality control. The Pirates! is a world-class piece of entertainment, with talented animators bringing their A-game to the table \u2013 literally, as most stop-motion animation is executed on table-top sets.</p> <p>It's a rollicking tale of a band of pleasant pirates and their well-intentioned but ineffectual captain (played by Hugh Grant). Maybe it's because he's off camera, but Grant has never sounded as relaxed, confident and funny as here. With the animators putting his character's puppet body through moves broader and bolder than the actor would ever do in life, they have collaborated to somehow deliver the best Grant performance possible. They embark on an adventure that takes in most of the seven seas and involves a weaselish Charles Darwin, the last Dodo and an evil Queen Victoria. The level of detail is incredible, with some sort of gag in nigh-on every shot, be it in dialogue, movement or set dressing.</p> <p>Like all the best children's entertainment, The Pirates! is a film that demands several viewings, and youngsters will come back to it in later years to notice things that sailed completely over their head when they first saw it.</p> <p><em>Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, DVD, Sony</em></p> <h2><strong>Last Shop Standing</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Refreshingly optimistic look at how the passion and human interaction of the UK's independent record shops have kept the music biz going.</p> <p><em>DVD, Proper</em></p> <h2><strong>Lawrence Of Arabia</strong></h2> <p>A pristine 4K HD remastering of David Lean's classic.</p> <p><em>Blu-ray, Sony</em></p> <h2><strong>Blade 2</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>This underrated \"manpire\" sequel is highly imaginative, gory and loaded with comic-book thrills.</p> <p><em>Blu-ray, EIV</em></p> <h2><strong>The Sweeney: Complete First Series</strong></h2> <p>Forget the rubbish remake, check out the infinitely superior original series, full of blags, slags and shouting.</p> <p><em>Blu-ray &amp; DVD, Network</em></p>",

  "<p>Before someone you know gets seriously ill, you tend to think that medicine consists of absolutes. Right answers. Perfect prescriptions. Broken bones fused so you never feel a twinge. But since my dad developed vascular dementia, I've realised that opinions differ, mistakes are made. Sometimes you have to decide yourself what might be for the best.</p> <p>There are so many grey areas; you long for certainties, branches to cling on to. Take Dad's diagnosis, for example. We all knew something was wrong. His short-term memory was shot. He flanked any conversation with bizarre non-sequiturs. He kept losing his car, taking the hinges off doors and dismantling appliances at night in the house where he lived alone. He'd leave 10 rambling messages in a row on our mobiles and then cheerily ring again, as if for the first time.</p> <p>Yet getting the medical authorities to concede there really was something going on was nigh on impossible.</p> <p>Part of me knows that's how it occasionally has to be. Sometimes it's better not to label the no-man's land between health and illness, especially when it involves an individual's loss of freedom. And confidentiality is important \u2013 there is only so far that concerned family members can go in expressing opinions.</p> <p>However, I still don't think anyone spent enough time properly appraising him or taking our worries seriously. There needs to be a hand there to catch those who are freefalling.</p> <p>Dad was always charming, full of stories. When the consultant came to assess him at home, finally referred by the GP, Dad just spun his usual web of yarns. Made tea. Covered up the holes in his head. The doctor said he seemed fine. He'd been through a bit of stress lately, perhaps it was that. To be on the safe side, he referred him for tests for Alzheimer's, which came back negative, of course, as the form of dementia Dad suffers from is vascular. So he was deemed capable.</p> <p>A few months later, things were worse. Dad kept visiting the police station and the hospital. I think, heart-breakingly, he wanted someone in authority to help, to stop the confusion in his head. By then his house was freezing as he'd attacked his boiler and gouged out the lock on his front door. If we got it fixed, he would break it again the very next night. So the consultant came again and did the same questionnaire. This time the diagnosis was \"probable vascular dementia\".</p> <p>I find that \"probable\" infuriating, even now. I just don't understand the room for doubt, when he was patently so poorly. And if it was there, why couldn't someone have just spent a bit more time with him to make sure?</p> <p>I know the NHS is strapped. I appreciate the need for caution. But it might have prevented those frightening months when Dad spun so badly out of control. It might have stopped all those hours he spent zooming around country lanes in his snazzy red Citro\u00ebn, when it wasn't safe to do so. It could have prevented the time he nearly slipped into hypothermia under a thin blanket on a particularly icy night in his lonely house by the sea.</p> <p>It seems hard to believe, but that was only two and a half years ago. His deterioration has been so complete, that recalling our uncertainty over whether he was ill seems laughable.</p> <p>But now the diagnosis is incontrovertible, other ambiguities persist. Should he be started on anti-psychotic pills or will they damage his weak heart? Does the Valium help to make him calmer or just zonk him out? Just how often is he having those mini-strokes that peg his decline?</p> <p>The scary thing is that I'm not sure there are any right answers. But that doesn't stop me longing for them.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Follow Rebecca on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rebeccahelenley\" title=\"\"><em> @rebeccahelenley</em></a></p>",
  "<p>I was a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00xj4wh\" title=\"\">guest on BBC Women's Hour</a> the other week, and one of the contributors made an interesting remark \u2013 an unusual event in itself for WH, but this comment actually got me thinking. She said: \"I don't know any woman who doesn't suffer from guilt.\" I have no way of knowing whether this is true, but it feels plausible. There is, for a modern woman, plenty she can find to feel guilty about. Perhaps the food binge, the shopping splurge, the career woman struggling with maternal guilt. Perhaps the failure of yet another diet, the collapse of another exercise regime, the malicious comment later regretted.</p> <p>I have rarely come across a man tormented by everyday guilt. Perhaps they just keep it quiet. Either way, guilt is a pernicious business that destroys more than it creates. But no one can ever quite say what it is, which is probably why it is so difficult to shake off.</p> <p>It is frequently confused with conscience, which is \"good\" guilt \u2013 recognising that you have done something wrong, atoning or apologising for it, and then moving on. Guilt is stickier than this. It seems to find a semi-permanent niche in the psyche of those who are susceptible to it.</p> <p>People inclined to feelings of guilt \u2013 ie feeling bad when they have done nothing wrong in particular \u2013 come as several types. There are those who felt as children that they were Bad and are spending the rest of their lives trying to keep this perception at bay. These are the Damaged Guilty. They include people who were mistreated or neglected in some fashion.</p> <p>Then there are the Ideological Guilty \u2013 those whose beliefs about how virtuous they and others should be are unrealistically elevated. The Ideologically Guilty believe that people should be pure, good and beyond reproach. They feel endlessly disappointed with themselves \u2013 and other people \u2013 when they are confronted with the fact that the default human condition is weakness and flaw. Women, with their cultural patriarchal legacy of being Madonnas (as an alternative to whores), seem to me particularly susceptible to this variety of guilt.</p> <p>This kind of guilt is largely self-directed, but some people inflict guilt on others to make them miserable \u2013 the Guilt Dispensers. The Jewish mother is the classic stereotype for this, but it tends to apply in close-knit families generally. In marriages, Guilt Dispensers often pair up with the Damaged Guilty, thus setting up a power dynamic, with the GD inevitably having the upper hand over the DG. Guilt can make you behave atrociously \u2013 not only towards yourself but also towards others. Quite apart from those who work to make other people feel guilty, there are those who punish others in order to evade their own feelings of guilt.</p> <p>Nevertheless, there are those \u2013 the church for instance, and the political establishment \u2013 who think we couldn't do without guilt. In this view, guilt is a necessary corrective to hedge against bad or anti-social behaviour. I disagree. Marriages and families would certainly be better without it (which is not to say they would be better without conscience). Guilt appears in proportion to the amount of freewill you think you have, because guilty people think they are responsible for everything. It is a form of control freakery.</p> <p>I have come to the conclusion that one of a husband's subtlest and most difficult tasks is to save his wife from guilt. This usually means being determined to head off her culturally inherited self-sacrificing Madonna-like instincts and not offering, but insisting that you organise the holiday/pick up the kids/clean the house/(insert unpleasant task here). Being given no choice in the matter saves the oppression guilt brings \u2013 and it saves you from the punishment that guilt can so often elicit. I recommend it. One&#xa0;of these days, I might even try it.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Follow Tim on Twitter </em><a href=\"http://es.twitter.com/timlottwriter\" title=\"\"><em>@timlottwriter</em></a></p>",

  "<p>Does being uprooted matter? Does being removed from the country in which you were born and where you spent the first years of your life leave an indefinable emotional scar? I don't believe so. Many of the \"uprooted\" are clearly much happier in their adopted countries than they were in their countries of origin. But making a new home in a completely new environment and a completely new language inevitably influences a person's perceptions, both about him- or herself and about others.</p> <p>I was born in Jerusalem shortly before the second world war and lived there until I was nearly nine. It would never again be my home.</p> <p>My parents had met there, both having left Germany soon after Hitler came to power. My mother had had to abandon her legal studies in Berlin when the Nazis decreed that Jews could no longer practise law. My father, at that time already a successful lawyer, was debarred from continuing his career. But they were young and unattached and, like many Jews who could afford to start a new life, they set off for Palestine, where Jews could live freely. They married in 1937.</p> <p>Neither of them were committed Zionists. On the contrary, my father's experiences in the first world war as a soldier in the German army (he had won an Iron Cross) had put him off all forms of nationalism. My mother, before the rise of Hitler, had been in favour of assimilation, believing that the more Jews and non-Jews intermarried, the more likely it would be that the \"Jewish problem\" would gradually fade away.</p> <p>Nor were they religious. In common with many German Jews, they did not observe Jewish customs or traditions in any shape or form. Throughout my childhood I never once entered a synagogue \u2013 I barely knew there were such places \u2013 and was brought up in ignorance of the most basic tenets of Judaism.</p> <p>Soon after his arrival in Jerusalem, my father, whose family had been in the retail business, set up a women's fashion store. It was to become the largest such store in the city (which was much smaller in those days). The Queen of Jordan sometimes shopped there. We lived in a large flat above the shop where, as an only child, I spent a great deal of time playing on my own. At home I spoke German and later, at school, Hebrew.</p> <p>My mother was much stricter than would be acceptable today. During mealtimes, for example, I often had to hold books under my arms to make sure that my elbows weren't sticking out. If I didn't finish my spinach at lunchtime, it would be served up again for supper, with a bit of sugar sprinkled on it.</p> <p>Not that my childhood in Jerusalem was unhappy. One of my most vivid memories, for example, is of an annual excursion to pick flowers with my adored father. He would take the day off \u2013 presumably with the aim of putting in what is now called \"quality time\" with me \u2013 and we would walk hand in hand to the outskirts of town. We would clamber across rocky hills looking for the long-stemmed wild cyclamen \u2013 pink, purple and white \u2013 that sprang up every year in the patches of dusty earth between the rocks.</p> <p>We were always alone on this stony high ground, with its panoramic view of the old city surrounded by olive groves. Even as a small child I could sense that there was something historic and mythical in this landscape, or so it seems to me now.</p> <p>Life at home and at school was going well when, in 1947 (just before the state of Israel came into being), my parents decided to leave Palestine; they were eager to resume their former careers. When we set sail, I thought we were going on holiday. I had no idea that I was never to return \u2013 or only years later, as a tourist. I suppose my parents felt that to explain that we were emigrating would upset me too much. So I was not given the chance to say goodbye to my friends, teachers or anyone else.</p> <p>While my parents travelled to England and America looking for work, they left me in a small boarding school in Switzerland. It was a completely different world and I was overwhelmed by so many new impressions and demands that I soon began to forget my old life. I also began to forget the Hebrew language. When they came to fetch me after a year, I was speaking Swiss-German, which they could barely understand.</p> <p>Eventually my father was offered an important and very suitable job with an Anglo-American legal aid society to compensate the victims of Nazi persecution. But there was a downside: it meant living in Germany, the last place my parents had wanted to go back to. They reluctantly agreed, but couldn't accept that their daughter should be brought up and educated as a German.</p> <p>Throughout my childhood my parents never talked to me about the Holocaust. Presumably, they wished to protect me from the knowledge of human evil. Indeed, I gradually deduced, but was never directly told, that my mother's parents had perished in a concentration camp. My mother had travelled back to Germany shortly before the outbreak of war to persuade them to leave but they had refused. A regime as barbaric as Hitler's, they thought, could surely not survive.</p> <p>My parents wanted me to be English. Like most refugees throughout the world, they greatly admired England \u2013 for its tolerance, its independent spirit, its courage in resisting tyranny, its rule of law.</p> <p>In 1948, my mother went to England to search for a suitable boarding school for me. At that time, many girls' boarding schools did not accept pupils who spoke no English. So she decided on Dartington Hall, the co-educational, \"progressive\" and somewhat notorious school situated in Devon. She deposited me there and left me to sink or swim.</p> <p>I sank, temporarily at least. It is a miserable experience to be completely cut off, without a single family member or trusted friend in the whole country to speak to or confide in. Every evening I used to hide in a corner of the school's large, dark gym so that I could cry without being seen.</p> <p>It took about a year to learn fluent English, after which I soon became an integrated and happy member of the school. Luckily for me, there was a terrific craze for roller-skating a few months after I arrived and because I had learned ice-skating in Switzerland, I was a whizz at this \"sport\". So my lowly status was slightly enhanced.</p> <p>Occasionally my parents came to see me, but my chief memory of these visits is the embarrassment I felt because of their German accents. As they had intended, I had been thoroughly anglicised.</p> <p>In the ensuing years I was too preoccupied \u2013 getting married, having children, working \u2013 to think much about my childhood in Jerusalem. I did, however, have a rather surprising experience in my thirties, when I went to see the Hollywood epic Exodus. Before this very mediocre film begins, while the credits are rolling, the wide screen is filled with some beautiful panoramic scenes of Jerusalem and its surrounding hills and olive trees. As soon as I saw this, I unexpectedly burst into tears.</p> <p>Since then, I have only been to Israel for three or four short visits, the most recent of which came about in a most unexpected way. I found myself seated, at a conference, next to a charming Israeli journalist. He was about the same age as me and had also been born in Jerusalem. But talking about our common background turned out to be a uncomfortable experience.</p> <p>What school had I attended, he asked. Alas, I couldn't remember its name. What about the names of any teachers? Again, sorry, can't remember. OK, surely I could recall the names of some school friends?</p> <p>Well, yes, I remember the name of one girl, who had been my best friend \u2013 Ruth. Ruth what? It was almost exactly 60 years ago, I protested.</p> <p>\"Well,\" he said, \"I regard this as a challenge. I will find your Ruth.\" He was as good as his word. It took him only a few phone calls.</p> <p>My Ruth turned out to be a good friend of his. She remembered me well.</p> <p>A day or two later I got a call from Ruty (as she was known) who sounded so friendly and jolly that I was instantly drawn to her. We decided to email each other our life stories, starting from the time we had last seen each other.</p> <p>So began an absorbing correspondence, which proceeded by chronological instalments. Every day we would eagerly await the arrival of a new episode and, like Victorian novelists, we sometimes deliberately ended on a cliff-hanger. Our stories could hardly have been more different.</p> <p>Ruty's life resembled an action thriller. After military service she had worked in various psychiatric centres and addiction clinics; she had founded Israel's first organisation to help dyslexic students and she had worked in the Israeli parliament, becoming head of the foreign relations department. Meanwhile, she had lived through the hardships and terrors of war. My story by contrast, with its succession of desk jobs, was more akin to a romantic novelette.</p> <p>When our narratives reached the present day, Ruty invited me to Jerusalem, to attend a lunch party she was giving for her women friends. Of course I accepted.</p> <p>The party was attended by about 30 women \u2013 doctors, archaeologists, lawyers, journalists. I have never before, or since, been to a gathering where there was such a strong feeling of mutual trust, openness and equality.</p> <p>None of the elements which so often impair the enjoyment of social occasions in England \u2013 cliquishness, social insecurity, insincerity, and so on \u2013 were present. I was hugely impressed and attracted by these women, but at the same time felt very English, and very much an outsider.</p> <p>The question I was most often asked was: \"Why did you leave Israel?\"</p> <p>My reply, that it had been my parents' decision, not mine, seemed not quite to satisfy them. Perhaps I was imagining this \u2013 there was certainly nothing reproachful in anyone's reaction \u2013 but I felt an unasked question hovering in the air: why hadn't I come back when I was old enough to make my own decisions?</p> <p>How would I have replied? The truth is that it never occurred to me to return to Israel. I greatly admired the country's achievements \u2013 its democratic way of life, its outstanding universities, its cultural attainments, its contributions to medicine and so on \u2013 but I had no family or friends there. I had been brought up, for better or worse, without any sense of religious or ethnic identity. Though I have never felt totally at home in England, I married an English husband and had brought up two English children.</p> <p>I was very happy to be English \u2013 or almost English.</p> <p><em>\u2022 An Almost English Life, by Miriam Gross, is published by Short Books, \u00a314.99.

Refunds are the most vexing issue, and unfortunately there is no straightforward answer.</p> <p>Shoppers' basic statutory rights are enshrined in the Sale of Goods Act of 1979. But ultimately what happens is dependent on individual circumstances.</p> <p>Goods bought from a shop must be fit for purpose, match any description given and be of satisfactory quality. If these requirements are not met, you may have a legal right to reject them and get your money back.</p> <p>If you cannot get back to the shop for some days, you should telephone and let the seller know you have a problem with the goods. Usually the right to reject is about three to four weeks from the date of sale, not the date of inspection. After that, in most cases you have lost the right to reject. Legally, you have a \"reasonable\" time to use or inspect goods. The problem is that there is no legal definition of what \"reasonable\" is. You don't have to have a receipt \u2013 usually a proof of purchase is satisfactory.</p> <p>You have no right to take the goods back simply because you have changed your mind.&#xa0; Many shops do have a returns policy, but there is no legal obligation to provide&#xa0;one.</p> <p>The next most popular question on Google, about displaying prices, is more straightforward. The law requires mainstream retailers to display prices, including VAT, and to be \"clearly&#xa0; legible\". Items do not have to be individually priced (they can use a price list) but the price should be available so that the customer does not have to ask for it.</p> <p>Shops don't have to accept \u00a350 notes. Banknotes are \"legal tender\" \u2013 but that doesn't mean anyone has to accept them.<strong> RS</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395813642\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347018187586/Where-cheap-Google-image-001.jpg\" alt=\"Where cheap Google image\" width=\"460\" height=\"197\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Where cheap Google image Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Only one thing seems to beat the UK consumer's obsession with finding the cheapest iPad or iPhone: it's finding cheap flights and holidays.

  "<p>It was late evening on a Monday in April, the end of a bright autumn day in Johannesburg, when Mum died. The nurses who were caring for her had made her comfortable for the night, turning her on to her side with a pillow to cuddle, the way&#xa0;she liked to sleep. My sisters Vicky and Jassy&#xa0;and I were with her. We held her hands, told&#xa0;her how much we loved her, and that it was safe and right for her to go. After a few minutes, her breathing stopped. It was a good death \u2013 the kind&#xa0;of death I think most people would choose if&#xa0;we could: free from pain and surrounded by love. She wasn't hooked up to tubes or monitors; she was even wearing her own pretty nightdress rather than a hospital gown. I&#xa0;suppose it's what you'd call a natural death. But in&#xa0;one way Mum's&#xa0;death was exceptional, shocking even. She&#xa0;had decided to die, about 10 days before, and&#xa0;for the&#xa0;previous six days had had no food and almost&#xa0;no water. She had chosen to die of thirst.</p> <p>The story of Mum's death begins in September 2008, when she sent an email to her daughters, telling us that she had been diagnosed with colon cancer. \"Don't worry about me, darlings,\" she wrote \u2013 but it was clear that she herself was desperately worried: about loss of dignity, about the cost of her medical care, about whether Dad would be able to learn to make his favourite spaghetti bolognese if she was unable to cook for them both \u2013 all the details of death. In the event, after a frightening and rocky few weeks and major surgery, Mum recovered well, and by the beginning of this year we had all started to make plans to celebrate her 80th birthday in August. With Mum and Dad's five daughters living so far&#xa0;apart, times when we were all together are rare and precious.</p> <p>Then, at the end of February, came a letter from my eldest sister Emma in place of Mum's normal Sunday email. \"Mum isn't feeling great,\" she wrote, \"and she asked me to write so you wouldn't worry.\" But, of course, we instantly did begin to worry, and it was only a few days before the diagnosis we'd dreaded arrived. Mum's cancer had metastasised and spread to her brain and possibly also to her lungs. Her oncologist immediately set her on a course of radiotherapy and cortisone to shrink the tumours, telling us that it would take up&#xa0;to two weeks before we knew whether the treatment had been effective.</p> <p>Vicky, who has experience caring for the terminally ill, travelled to Johannesburg to help Mum and Dad, and they had long and honest talks about the decisions Mum faced. She wasn't quite ready, she said at first, to leave Dad, \"this beautiful world\", as she put it, and us. But over the next few days, Mum's condition began to deteriorate, and she became increasingly uncomfortable and frustrated. Mum was a very private person. She loved order; she hated mess and squalor, and illness is often messy and squalid. She told Vicky again and again that she didn't want to go through more treatment. She didn't want Dad to see cancer killing her. She wanted to die quickly and quietly. She didn't want any fuss.</p> <p>It was Emma who first told Mum about an article she'd read several years earlier in the <a href=\"http://jama.jamanetwork.com/journal.aspx\" title=\"\">Journal of the American Medical Association</a> about voluntary refusal of food and drink as a means of bringing about death in the terminally ill. The author described it as a relatively painless way to die: a&#xa0;gradual slipping away into a coma, followed by death. Typically, a person will take between five and 10 days to die this way and, crucially, they have the option to change their mind and stop the process until almost the end. Mum just latched on to the idea, Emma remembers. She decided that she was going to stop taking the cortisone that was keeping the tumours in check, and stop eating and drinking as well. She wasn't going to let the disease take over.</p> <p>Like many people, I simply didn't know that choosing to stop eating and drinking is, as Jassy put it, \"a Thing\". But it is \u2013 it's a thing about which you can find pages and pages of information on the internet, once you have a reason to Google it. It's a thing that's been reported quite extensively in medical literature, known variously as VSED (<a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Voluntary+Stopping+Eating+and+Drinking&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;redir_esc=&amp;ei=2KJEUKi8Nuqw0QXc-IDgBA\" title=\"\">Voluntary Stopping Eating and Drinking</a>), VRFF (<a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Voluntary+Stopping+Eating+and+Drinking&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;redir_esc=&amp;ei=2KJEUKi8Nuqw0QXc-IDgBA#hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=Voluntary+Refusal+of+Food+and+Fluid&amp;oq=Voluntary+Refusal+of+Food+and+Fluid&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0.26725.26725.0.27518.1.1.0.0.0.0.304.304.3-1.1.0...0.0...1c.u7CVEMMNukw&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=1015eafb01221851&amp;biw=1544&amp;bih=989\" title=\"\">Voluntary Refusal of Food and Fluid</a>), PRNH (<a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Voluntary+Stopping+Eating+and+Drinking&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;redir_esc=&amp;ei=2KJEUKi8Nuqw0QXc-IDgBA#hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=Patient+Refusal+of+Nutrition+and+Hydration&amp;oq=Patient+Refusal+of+Nutrition+and+Hydration&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0j0i30.18099.18099.1.19079.1.1.0.0.0.0.90.90.1.1.0...0.0...1c.n_11dpZZ1F0&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=1015eafb01221851&amp;biw=1544&amp;bih=989\" title=\"\">Patient Refusal of Nutrition and Hydration</a>), or self-dehydration. It's&#xa0;a thing doctors who have practised for a long time and seen many patients die at home describe&#xa0;as \"taking to their bed\" or \"turning their&#xa0;face to the wall\".

It's a&#xa0;thing, as I discovered when researching this&#xa0;article, that people seem afraid to talk about.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395681435\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/5/1346844476948/Sophie-Mackenzie-family-s-008.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Mackenzie family snap\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018She wanted the kind of death most people would choose, if we could\u2019 (from left): Jassy, Juliet, Sophie, Emma and Vicky with their parents. Photograph: Courtesy Sophie Mackenzie</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Sophie Mackenzie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is nothing illegal about refusing food and drink; in fact, feeding a competent person against their will constitutes assault. Nonetheless, Mum was afraid that something would happen to prevent her reaching her goal. She worried about falling and breaking a hip, ending up in hospital and being caught in a spiral of intervention that would prolong her life. She worried that intravenous nutrition and hydration would be given to \"keep her comfortable\" if she became unconscious. She had signed a living will expressing her preferences, but such advance directives are generally regarded as worthless unless the dying person has a supportive medical team who understand their wishes and are prepared to act upon them.</p> <p>South Africa's legal position on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/assisted-suicide\" title=\"\">assisted dying</a> is fundamentally the same as Britain's: if you help another person bring about their death, you could risk prosecution. As in the UK, there have been attempts to clarify the law on end-of-life decision-making processes, removing the grey areas that currently exist. <a href=\"http://www.whoswho.co.za/willem-landman-3092\" title=\"\">Professor Willem Landman</a>, CEO of the Ethics Institute of South Africa, is one of the leading figures campaigning for a change in the law. He explains that in 1998, President Nelson Mandela commissioned a report into the legal and ethical issues surrounding assisted dying, assisted suicide and euthanasia, but after being tabled in parliament in 2000, the report was ignored by the ministry of health. Landman believes this may be because the then minister of health, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manto_Tshabalala-Msimang\" title=\"\">Dr Manto Tshabalala-Msimang</a>, regarded the issue as something of a middle-class problem. Perhaps it is. When birth and death are less medicalised and a more integral and familiar part of life, perhaps choice in&#xa0;such matters seems an unnecessary luxury. Perhaps mothers do die gently, cared for by their daughters, without worrying about indignity and fuss. But they don't die quickly, or without pain.</p> <p>Mum had always talked frankly to us about death. My sister Juliet remembers when she was a&#xa0;little girl and terrified of dying, Mum telling her, \"Your body is like a suit of old clothes \u2013 by that time you will be tired of it and you won't want it any more.\" Mum hated clutter and hoarding; when a thing had outlived its usefulness, it was to be disposed of without sentiment, whether it was a favourite dress the moths had got to, a book that was falling apart at the spine or her own body. She&#xa0;made it clear to us that she would far rather be dead than be a burden on her husband and daughters. Now, with her hands becoming increasingly unsteady and fits of dizziness coming unexpectedly, she was finding the colostomy bag she'd had since her surgery in 2008 difficult and humiliating to deal with. She felt that her body was wearing out and, more frighteningly, her head felt heavy and fuzzy.</p> <p>Over the course of a long phone call, Vicky told me that Mum had made a decision. She was going to stop taking the medication that was checking the spread of her cancer, and stop eating and drinking, too. We had about a week to say goodbye, so Juliet and I flew to Johannesburg as&#xa0;soon as we could. It was the sort of family reunion Mum loved, and in many ways it was like all the other happy times we have spent together, filled with love and laughter. We planned meals together, cooked in Mum and Dad's tiny kitchen, ate and drank together, just as we've always done on family holidays, over Christmases and at other celebrations \u2013 only this time it was Mum's life we were celebrating, while she went through the process of dying.</p> <p>It was the most remarkable week of my life, and&#xa0;it has left me unafraid of death.</p> <p>I'd been afraid of seeing Mum since this latest illness. I was expecting to find her diminished, somehow less herself. But I was amazed by how well she seemed. Vicky had cropped her hair so that she wouldn't have to experience it falling out, and Mum, with the pride in her looks that beautiful women never lose, was obviously upset by her appearance. But to me she looked lovely. She shone with happiness at having all her daughters there with her and Dad. She was full of her usual curiosity and humour. She didn't look like someone who was ready to die, and this frightened me \u2013 what if somehow stopping eating and drinking didn't work, and Mum lingered on in pain? What if the process didn't take a matter of days but a matter of weeks? Part of me knew how much she would hate to be thwarted in her intent; part of me longed to keep her with us for longer, and hoped that, even now, some sort of miracle might happen. I even suggested to Mum&#xa0;that she should stay at home for a few days,&#xa0;just to see how she felt, but she was adamant: her decision had been made. The next&#xa0;day, she was going to move to the nursing home at the retirement community where she and Dad lived, and she was going to die there.</p> <p>Although Mum was unable to walk unsupported and her hands were very shaky, she was alert and lucid, chatting to us as she always had. Her appetite was small, but she was still enjoying food: pizza with olives and anchovies, strong cheddar cheese, the fruit cake Juliet had baked and been saving for Mum's 80th birthday. Juliet's cake was the last thing Mum ate, on Wednesday 28 March, when her brother visited to say goodbye, and she had a last chat with her sister in the UK. We were all in tears that morning, except for Mum, who stayed calm and cheerful.</p> <p>I didn't see Mum leave her home for the last time. Dad, Emma, Juliet and Vicky were with her,&#xa0;and Juliet cried afterwards when she told Jassy and me how Mum had gone around the little house where she and Dad had been so happy,&#xa0;saying goodbye to it and all her precious things, before being driven the few hundred yards to the nursing home. The staff there welcomed her and settled her into bed, and she&#xa0;curled up and went to sleep.</p> <p>It's fortunate that Mum was surrounded by people who supported her decision. Her GP believes that people at the end of their lives should have the right to be \"conductors of their own orchestra\", and made it plain that she would prescribe whatever pain relief Mum needed to mask the symptoms of her advancing cancer, and&#xa0;whatever sedation she required to alleviate distress. The management of the nursing home hold the same view. Her GP gave them written instructions explaining Mum's decision and outlining the care she would need. \"She is a very brave lady,\" the email concluded. And, of course, Mum had five daughters who adored her and a&#xa0;husband who'd worshipped her for almost 60 years, and we were all unequivocally on her side.</p> <p>The five of us sisters rallied behind Mum and Dad; we were a team. As I write this, it's difficult to isolate my own feelings and experiences from those of my sisters \u2013 who said what, who made decisions, who cried. It's a gruesome analogy, but the five of&#xa0;us, Dad, Mum's GP and her carers were like a&#xa0;cheerleading squad urging her on towards the goal she had chosen. This isn't always the case. I&#xa0;was horrified to read a 2011 report in the New York Times which <a href=\"http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/deciding-to-die-then-shown-the-door/\" title=\"\">told the story of Armond and Dorothy Rudolph</a>. The Rudolphs, both in their 90s and with failing health, made the decision to&#xa0;end their lives together by stopping eating and drinking while they were still mentally competent and able to live independently. The management of the assisted-living facility where they had their&#xa0;home responded by attempting to evict them. It was only after intervention by the couple's family, the local press and medical and legal experts that the attempt was stopped. Armond Rudolph died after 10 days without food&#xa0;and drink, and Dorothy a day later.</p> <p>We laughed a lot over the next few days. We teased Juliet about developing late-onset colour-blindness when she kept putting bottles of red wine in the fridge, while the white stayed warm on the kitchen counter. Jassy and I speculated macabrely about what would happen if the nurses forgot to take down the \"Nil by Mouth\" sign over Mum's bed after she died \u2013 we imagined some poor old dear being moved into her cubicle and waving plaintively as the tea trolley rattled unheedingly past. Emma and Juliet still haven't let me forget the nightmare 10-mile walk I dragged them on around the suburbs of Johannesburg, possibly the world's least pedestrian-friendly city. One night after dinner, Emma and Juliet went to visit Mum, and the three of them chatted and reminisced until eventually my sisters were asked to leave \u2013 their laughter was keeping the other old ladies awake.</p> <p>In the midst of Mum's death, our normal lives went on. I was writing a seemingly endless list of&#xa0;product descriptions of cheeses \u2013 I'd hoped that Mum would have enjoyed working with me on them; a writer herself, she would have embraced the challenge of describing the differences between stilton and roquefort. But she was too drowsy, although she loved being read to. We planned each day as it came: who would be spending time with Mum, and when; who would cook, and what, and for how many. Of&#xa0;course we talked about Mum and what was happening, sharing our fears about what the next&#xa0;few days would hold, and our happy memories of her. Often, it felt just as if she was there with us, as she always had been when the family was together.</p> <p>There were hard parts, too. By Friday, although Mum was still spending a lot of time asleep, her&#xa0;waking hours were difficult. She was dreaming, she told us, about drinking ice-cold Coke, and waking feeling desperately thirsty, as&#xa0;one does with a bad hangover. Chips of ice helped to relieve the dryness in her mouth, and&#xa0;she had sugar-free mints to suck as well as frequent glycerine mouth swabs, but the thirst remained. She also developed a pounding headache as her&#xa0;blood sugar level fell. Emma bought her some&#xa0;Coke, thinking that the occasional sip would make her more comfortable&#xa0;and do little or&#xa0;nothing to prolong her life. But Vicky, determined to support Mum&#xa0;completely in her decision, said,&#xa0;\"It could set her back days!\" and took it away, leaving the&#xa0;nurses crying in her wake. That&#xa0;day, Mum said to&#xa0;us, \"I didn't realise it would be so hard.\"</p> <p>She wasn't the only one. Being a spectator at the death of someone you love is bitterly hard. We expect medical science to intervene to relieve suffering, and to a great extent it does. But the journey is a lonely one. Even surrounded by the people who loved her most, and professionals who gave her the very best palliative care, Mum fought her battle for death alone. How much more lonely, and how much more frightening, the process must be for people who aren't supported by their family, or aren't able to communicate their wishes, I can only imagine.</p> <p>Mum spent a lot of the next three days asleep, but when she was awake, we chatted to her and to&#xa0;each other, and Jassy read to her from her new novel, which is dedicated to Mum. She also enjoyed having her hands massaged with her favourite body lotion as her skin began to get dryer, and the scent greeted us when we came into the ward to see her. Dad was his usual self: strong, serene and often silent, surrounded by his&#xa0;five chattering daughters, but occasionally cracking us all up with his characteristic dry wit. He spent a lot of time at Mum's bedside, sitting with her while she slept. Mostly, it was a peaceful&#xa0;and happy time.</p> <p>On Sunday, Mum began to slip away. In the morning she was still alert, asking for ice to suck and chatting to us almost normally, but by the evening she was no longer able to speak easily. I'd&#xa0;had a bad cold for the previous few days, and when I heard the new rattle in Mum's breathing, I&#xa0;became convinced that she had caught it and my virus was going to be the thing that finally carried her off. I sat by her bed and cried my heart out \u2013 a&#xa0;mixture of guilt, grief and all the stress of the last few days just pouring out of me. I felt embarrassed by my tears in the face of Mum's courage \u2013 absurdly, I didn't want to worry her. She&#xa0;asked me several times, \"Am I going to be all right?\" I told her that she was, and that I loved her. There wasn't anything else to say. That was the last time she spoke.</p> <p>For most of the six days it took her to die, Mum&#xa0;was in no pain. The morphine patches she had been prescribed relieved any symptoms her advancing cancer might have caused, and the sedatives kept her calm and drowsy. However, it's not known whether such palliative care actually removes the dying person's experience of hunger and thirst, even once they have lost consciousness. A <a href=\"http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2011/11/03/medethics-2011-100278.abstract\" title=\"\">paper published in the Journal of Medical Ethics in 2011</a> concluded that \"continuous deep sedation may blunt the wakefulness component of human consciousness without eradicating internal affective awareness of thirst and hunger\". I hope that, for Mum, the&#xa0;dreams of ice-cold Coke and the&#xa0;sensation of thirst stopped once&#xa0;she fell asleep&#xa0;on that Sunday&#xa0;night.</p> <p>On Monday morning, Mum was moved from the main ward where she had spent the past five nights. The curtains around her bed had remained closed while she was there \u2013 Mum would have wanted the privacy, we knew, but still we speculated darkly about whether the staff had kept her hidden in case the other ladies got ideas and decided to emulate her. Her new bed was in a private room. She barely woke when she was lifted, and she was losing the ability to swallow. In the afternoon, the vicar came to say the last rites, with all five of us sisters and Dad there, perching on her bed and chairs around it. Mum seemed to be aware of the words of the service \u2013 perhaps owing to the vicar's maximum-decibel delivery, which we all laughed about afterwards \u2013 but she was sliding deeper and deeper into unconsciousness.</p> <p>That evening passed slowly, as time does when&#xa0;you're waiting for something important to happen. I carried on with my writing \u2013 the cheese product descriptions were complete and I'd moved on to fish, and it was comforting to escape into work. Emma and Juliet were spending the night at home with&#xa0;Emma's partner and his children. Dad did a crossword puzzle; Vicky made a batch of chicken soup, using Mum's recipe. Over dinner we talked about the practical things that would soon need to be done, and decided that Vicky would be the one to phone the undertaker, and that she would remove and take care of Mum's rings and watch. We asked Dad if he felt it was important for him to&#xa0;be there when Mum died, but he felt that he had&#xa0;already said a very temporary goodbye \u2013 he was, and remains, confident that they will be together always once he joins her. So Jassy, Vicky and I took the familiar route up to the nursing home to see how&#xa0;Mum was and decide what to do&#xa0;about spending the night with her. It was the last time we'd walk that way; within a few minutes&#xa0;of our arrival, she was dead.</p> <p>I went back to Jassy's house that night and wrote about Mum's death. My overwhelming feelings were relief and pride \u2013 my brave, beautiful mother had taken on the hardest challenge of her life, and&#xa0;won. I could go home to my partner, whom I&#xa0;missed desperately, my home in London and my&#xa0;little cat. My sisters and Dad felt the same, I&#xa0;think: tired, but triumphant, too. We'd achieved&#xa0;what we had set out to do, as sisters and&#xa0;as a family.</p> <p>Even if <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignitas_%28assisted_dying_organisation%29\" title=\"\">Dignitas</a> had been a practical option for&#xa0;Mum, I don't believe she would have chosen it. Apart from anything else, she loathed travelling. (I suspect she would also have regarded the cost as a wanton extravagance.) But&#xa0;what if there had been another way for her to&#xa0;take? An injection administered by a doctor she&#xa0;trusted, or pills brought to her by Dad or one of us? I'm not sure. Perhaps she wouldn't have wanted anyone else to bear the responsibility of having ended her life. Also, I think part of her relished the challenge, the control and the independence of doing it the hard way.</p> <p>In the obituary that was read at Mum's funeral, Vicky remembered a saying that Mum was fond of quoting: \"Old age is not for sissies.\" Mum was no&#xa0;sissy \u2013 as Emma put it later, Mum was a soldier. She embarked on her final journey with steely determination, astonishing courage and immense dignity. I feel honoured to have been a part of the&#xa0;process. I've seen that it is possible to choose and achieve a good death, on one's own terms. I&#xa0;used to be in favour of changing the law on end-of-life choices; now I am evangelical about the importance of autonomy in terminal illness and&#xa0;death. I'm so proud of what Mum did, and of&#xa0;how my father, my sisters and I helped her to achieve it. But that doesn't alter my passionate belief that people in Mum's position, or Tony Nicklinson's, or Martin's, should have more, better and easier choices.</p>",
  "<p>Ten years ago, no one could quite define what it meant to be a fashion blogger. The term described a diverse bunch of style fans with the technology to upload pictures and picks of&#xa0;the season. Fast-forward a&#xa0;decade, and top-tier bloggeristas are fashion stars in their own right, earning fat wages, shooting advertising campaigns, consulting for top brands and seated front row at every major catwalk show.</p> <p>The original blogs operated as little more than hobbies. Individuality was celebrated and bloggers' online diaries were a shop window for clothes they enthused about without any sense of editorial decorum. Bloggers either modelled the outfits themselves, or snapped others in&#xa0;looks they liked. But as fashion sites proliferated, blogging became a genuine career for fashion fans. In 2010, US blogger Bryan Grey Yambao (who in 2008 famously had a Marc Jacobs bag named after him) boasted that he earned more than $100,000 a year from his website, <a href=\"http://www.bryanboy.com/\" title=\"\">bryanboy.com</a>. Earlier this year, <a href=\"http://www.thesartorialist.com/\" title=\"\">thesartorialist.com</a>'s Scott Schuman and Garance Dore were awarded a&#xa0;prestigious gong from the <a href=\"http://cfda.com/\" title=\"\">Council of Fashion Designers America</a>.</p> <p>Early blogs featured stylish folk wearing clothes their own way \u2013 an interesting scarf&#xa0;here, a rolled up cuff there \u2013 but a&#xa0;distinct, almost cartoonish look has evolved. Bold prints, clashing colours, statement pieces and larger-than-life accessories became the hallmarks of the fashion blogger. This season, \"blogger\" has become trend in its own right: <a href=\"http://www.riverisland.com/Online/women/get-the-look/blogger/blogger\" title=\"\">River Island has named one of its major trends Blogger</a>, a&#xa0;look it describes as \"organised chaos\", with clashing prints and OTT pieces; and next month H&amp;M launches a collaboration with Anna Dello Russo, fashion director at Vogue&#xa0;Japan and <a href=\"http://www.annadellorusso.com/\" title=\"\">blogger extrordinaire</a>.</p> <p>Bethan Holt, of <a href=\"http://fashioneditoratlarge.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">fashioneditoratlarge.blogspot.co.uk</a>, defines the blogger look as \"blatant \u2013 all about being high-maintenance and unashamedly fashion mad\". Whether fashion fans actually write blogs, or just subscribe to the blogging look,&#xa0;is now beside the point.</p> <p>It is ironic that a term that originally defined and celebrated individual style has come to describe a&#xa0;homogenised, exaggerated look. In truth, some bloggers subscribe to the bold, ornamental way of dressing favoured by Dello Russo, but others prefer the quieter, worn-in T-shirts, bare legs and beat-up boots look of the Scandinavian school of bloggers.</p> <p>Susie Lau, aka blogger <a href=\"http://www.stylebubble.co.uk\" title=\"\">Susie Bubble</a>, says that, if there is a&#xa0;\"blogger's look\", it's a reflection of mainstream trends to which the blogosphere adds its own twist. \"It can be a bit disheartening when blogs look exactly the same,\" she says. \"When I started, the community really celebrated individual style, but it's interesting to see it as a movement and how that affects consumer tastes.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Dello Russo, godmother of blog chic, is proud to see the development of \"the blogger\" as a style movement. As she said recently of her H&amp;M venture, \"This is an important evolution in fashion and I am both thrilled and humbled to be the one chosen&#xa0;to lead it.\" Time was when Dello Russo fans were able to blog only about getting her look. From next month, they'll be able to buy it, too.</p>",
  "<p>Start typing a query into Google \u2013 or whatever search engine you are using \u2013 and its autocomplete function will start suggesting popular questions from other users. So what do you want most answered? One of the top queries in the UK over the Olympics was \"is Ian Thorpe gay\".</p> <p>The Australian swimmer was the star of the BBC Olympics commentary team in August. But he also prompted a \"huge spike\" in internet searches about his sexuality, says Google. Just type \"is\" into google.co.uk and it automatically tries to complete the sentence as \"is Ian Thorpe gay\".</p> <p>The drop-down list in autocomplete is generated by the search engine's complex algorithms, based on other users' search activities and the contents of web pages indexed by Google.</p> <p>The suggestions often seem strange or just plain silly. Google agrees. It explains: \"There may be a search term that seems surprising to you, but after doing some searching on the web, you may discover that it's a popular phrase online for some reason that you didn't anticipate.</p> <p>\"Queries in autocomplete are algorithmically determined based on a number of factors (including search term popularity) without manual intervention.\"</p> <p>The suggestions reflect regional activity, so Thorpe tops a search beginning \"is\" in the UK, but not in the US (where \"is shingles contagious\" is the top search result).</p> <p>They also reflect recent activity \u2013 so Thorpe is likely to drop out of the list soon. \"Is Kate Middleton pregnant\" moved up from ninth to seventh most popular this week alone.</p> <p>Pornography, violence, and hate speech are excluded from autocomplete, but Google has frequently found itself in court over the suggestions autocomplete makes. It lost a case in France last year involving the word \"scam\" appearing after a particular company's name. Meanwhile, in Japan it is battling a district court's order to suspend autocomplete altogether.</p> <p>Here we reveal what you most want answered.</p> <h2>Will my credit card work after going through the washing machine?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396255398\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/MONEY/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347018263483/Credit-Crunch-Threatens-E-001.jpg\" alt=\"Credit Crunch Threatens Economy\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Credit card Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Worried about your credit rating? Your spouse's credit record? No, you're not. Start tapping into Google \"will my credit...\" and it reveals that the second most common dilemma is whether a credit card will survive a wash cycle. (The first, driven by users in the US, is \"will my credit card work in Europe.\") The trouble is, the answers that appear at the top of the search results can be as daft as the questions. For example, Yahoo! Answers tells you that a credit card that goes through a washing machine will carry on working so long as it's not damaged \u2013 but won't, if it is. True, but not especially helpful (and that was rated as \"best answer\" by Yahoo! readers).</p> <p>So we put it to Barclaycard, which operates more than 10m credit cards in the UK. It said: \"Water won't damage the ability of a chip to function.\" The bigger problem will be if the plastic warps or even melts.</p> <p>It seems credit card plastic can start to melt at around 57C, but that should make it safe in any British summer. Perhaps, though, you should be wary about flashing your plastic in Aziziya in Libya. It holds the record for the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%80%98Aziziya\" title=\"\">highest temperature measured</a>, at 57.8C (136F). Mind you, that was in 1922.</p> <p>As regards credit cards in Europe the Americans have a point; while our credit cards have a chip and the magnetic strip, most Americans are still using cards with a magnetic strips only, which might be rejected at some payment terminals over here. Tell them it's about European technological superiority.</p> <h2>Is my money safe in Santander?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396255399\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/MONEY/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347018309369/Santander-earnings-report-001.jpg\" alt=\"Santander earnings report\" width=\"220\" height=\"149\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Santander Photograph: Clive Gee/PA</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Gee/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before you've completed typing \"is my money safe \u2026\" up pops \"in Santander\" as the suggested question. Evidently loads of you are worried that Spain's crisis-hit economy and bombed-out banking sector will affect your savings in Santander, Spain's second biggest bank and our fifth biggest. Indeed, nearly all of the \"is my money safe\" suggestions are about Spain, although you also ask about Barclays.</p> <p>The good news is that one of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/may/18/santander-is-your-money-safe\" title=\"\">first results that comes up</a> on Google was written by the team here at Guardian Money. The basic answer is that Santander UK is wholly ringfenced from Santander Spain, and the Spanish parent company can't prop itself up by pinching capital from its UK operation.</p> <p>Even a collapse in the euro is likely to hurt the other major banks in Britain&#xa0;a lot more than Santander's UK operations. Still, we always recommend that savers do not put more than \u00a385,000 in any UK bank (Santander included). That's the maximum bailout from the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2008/oct/10/claiming-compensation\" title=\"\">Financial Services Compensation Scheme</a>.</p> <h2>Will a bank accept a torn cheque?</h2> <p>Lots of you worry about cheques being refused \u2013 maybe because there is a misspelling, or because it is torn or ripped. It all depends on how and where it is ripped. The industry group responsible for cheques, <a href=\"http://www.ukpayments.org.uk/\" title=\"\">the UK Payments Administration</a>, says: \"There are no hard and fast rules, but there is a standard format, and cheque clearing is an automated process, so any cheque which can't be easily processed, can run the risk of a branch saying that they won't accept it and you'll need a replacement. On all cheques there's a code line at the bottom which is \"read\" by the processing machines, so it's best for that area not to be damaged. Small cuts or tears (which we can all make to cheques as we try to get one out of an envelope) may not be an issue, but one that has been ripped into a few pieces and is held together by Sellotape, is likely to be rejected.</p> <p>\"Alternatively, your bank may make a small charge for processing a damaged cheque. Since it won't go through the automated process, it can be processed manually. This depends on the service that your bank offers \u2013 increasingly, banks require all cheques to go through a one-size-only pipe!\"</p> <p>The standard format means you can no longer write a cheque on an unusual object, as you might have done in the past. According to a Guardian \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-20434,00.html\" title=\"\">notes and queries</a>\" story in G2, cheques have been written on a cow, a horse, an egg, toilet paper, giant cards, etc. The cow story was actually true (it was a farmer's protest about EU policy) but the bank insisted on keeping the cow as evidence of the payment.</p> <h2>Is it fraud to accept too much change in a shop?</h2> <p>It's not fraud. But it probably is theft. Fraud is \"wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain\". Fraud would involve inducing the shopkeeper to part with the money, which is hardly the case with too much change.</p> <p>But knowingly taking too much is theft, defined as the unauthorised taking, keeping or using of another's property. Legally speaking, this does not extend to accepting that extra coin accidentally, for the act of theft has to be accompanied by a \"mens rea\" \u2013 a \"guilty mind\" \u2013 which includes the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the rightful possession of their property or its use. So if you know you have done it, and you know this is wrong (otherwise you would not ask the question) then it is wrong. Irrespective of the law, staff are often forced to make up shortages in the till at the end of the day from their own pockets. Hand it back.</p> <h2>Can I spend Scottish money in England?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396255400\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/MONEY/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347018384869/Scottish-money-001.jpg\" alt=\"Scottish money\" width=\"220\" height=\"161\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scottish money Photograph: David Cheskin/PA</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cheskin/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yes, you can \u2013 but it doesn't legally have to be accepted. Three banks in Scotland are authorised to issue notes: Bank of Scotland, Clydesdale Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland. There are also four note-issuing banks in Northern Ireland: Bank of Ireland; AIB Group (which trades as First Trust Bank in Northern Ireland), Northern Bank and Ulster Bank. Banknotes issued by all seven are legal currency and can be accepted throughout the UK. But it doesn't necessarily mean they will be. The <a href=\"http://www.acbi.org.uk\" title=\"\">Association of Commercial Banknote Issuers</a> (ACBI) states: \"The term 'legal tender' has very little practical meaning as far as ordinary, everyday transactions are concerned, and it has no bearing on the acceptability of authorised banknotes as a means of payment \u2026\" Crucially, it adds: \"The acceptability of any means of payment, including banknotes, is essentially a matter for agreement between the parties involved.\"</p> <p>English shopkeepers who are unfamiliar with them may refuse to accept Scottish or Northern Irish notes. This is usually because they cannot tell whether the note is genuine, rather than their feeling towards the Scots.</p> <p>Trivia fans may like the following: By law, authorised banks are required to hold backing assets for their notes at all times, which can be done in the form of special Bank of England notes \u2013 amounts can range up to \u00a31m notes (Giants) and \u00a3100m (Titans).</p> <h2>Why is saffron so expensive?</h2> <p>Brits are deeply puzzled as to why the luminous yellow-orange spice is so pricey. Type \"Why is so expensive\" into google.co.uk and top is: \"why is saffron so expensive?\" After that, it's insurance, Photoshop, champagne and Warhammer that users fret about.</p> <p>Adobe Photoshop is the photo-editing software, and the latest version, CS6, retails for around \u00a3449, which is rather a lot if all you want to do is remove red-eye. Warhammer is a part-hobby, part-gaming fantasy battle where players constantly grouch about the cost of individual dark elves, blood knights and dire wolves.</p> <p>But it's saffron, made from the stigmas of crocuses, which sparks most concern. A Schwartz jar containing just 0.4g retails for \u00a34.16 in Sainsbury's. A&#xa0;kilo will set you back \u00a310,400.</p> <p>The reason? It takes around two football pitches of crocuses to glean a kilo, with each stigma collected by hand.</p> <h2>Does my student loan affect my credit rating?</h2> <p>Student-loan related questions pepper Google autocomplete: when it will come through, what the interest rate will be, how and when it is paid off, and whether it will affect a mortgage. The credit rating one appears to be one of the most common \u2013 and it all depends on when you took out the loan.</p> <p>The bad news is that if you started higher education between 1990 and 1997, your student loan will impact on your credit score if you are a late payer or miss a repayment. The Student Loans Company writes to late payers giving them 28 days to make contact or the late/missed payment will show up on their credit record. But the good news is that if you started higher education between 1998 and 2011, your \"post-98\"-type of loan does not show up on credit reference agencies.</p> <h2>Should I pay off my student loan?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396255401\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/MONEY/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347018466199/University-students-in-ex-001.jpg\" alt=\"University students in exam room\" width=\"220\" height=\"142\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">University students Photograph: Alamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The answer depends on whether you have other debts, and when you studied. If you started higher education after 1998, you have a \"post-98\" loan and are paying interest at 1.5% (the Bank of England 0.5%, plus&#xa0;1%). You only repay this type of loan if you are earning above \u00a315,795, or from April 2013, over \u00a316,365. You can overpay whenever you like. For details, see <a href=\"http://www.studentloanrepayment.co.uk/portal/page?_pageid=93,3866794&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL\" title=\"\">studentloanrepayment.co.uk</a>.</p> <p>If you started higher education between 1990 and 1997, you have the old style \"mortgage\" type student loan and are paying interest at 3.6%. You must make repayments if you earn over \u00a327,813 a year, though you can pay before that. You can make extra payments on top any time and there are no penalties for early repayment.</p> <p>If you have other debts, the general rule is to pay them off first before paying off your student loan because the majority of other debts will be costing far more. And remember that, unlike other debts, if you don't earn enough, you simply don't need to repay student loans and any outstanding debt is written off after 25-30 years or if you die.</p> <p>If you still have cash to spare after paying off other debts, and you have a \"post-98\" loan, you will be better off saving your excess cash than using it to repay your loan. The interest you can earn in a top savings account outstrips the 1.5% cost of student loans, especially if you are a basic rate taxpayer.</p> <p>The same cannot be said if you are paying 3.6% on a pre-1998 loan. You will not easily outdo the student loan interest rate. Consider using spare cash to pay off your loan. But, think twice if there is any chance at all that you may need to borrow money in the future.</p> <p>A step-by-step guide to whether it's worth paying off your student loan, including a useful calculator showing you how long it will take to repay it, is at <a href=\"http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/students/student-loans-repay\" title=\"\">Moneysavingexpert.com</a>.</p> <h2>Is PayPal safe? </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396255402\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/MONEY/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347018527186/PayPal-logo-001.jpg\" alt=\"PayPal logo\" width=\"220\" height=\"137\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">PayPal Photograph: Alex Segre </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Segre</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Providing you ignore those \"phishing\" emails which pretend to come from PayPal (they try to get your personal banking details), it has a good security record.

PayPal is not a credit card so you have no protection under the <a href=\"http://www.oft.gov.uk/about-the-oft/legal-powers/legal/cca/\" title=\"\">Consumer Credit Act</a>. Its 45-day complaint period \u2013 after which it generally refuses to deal with consumers \u2013 has no basis in law other than PayPal's own terms and conditions. This can be very short \u2013 especially if dealing with an overseas seller. However, it is signed up to the Financial Ombudsman Service, so if you make a complaint that is not resolved to your satisfaction you can take it to the ombudsman. </p> <h2>How long will it take to transfer money overseas?</h2> <p>This really bothers bank customers \u2013 both the time it takes and the cost. In the past it could take as long as two weeks, and came with hefty fees.</p> <p>But, according to the <a href=\"http://www.paymentscouncil.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Payments Council</a>, rules in place since the start of this year mean that, in Europe at least, it should now be a lot faster. It states: \"The day after you send money electronically from a bank within the EU, the money must be received and credited to the recipient account (again, if within the EU). So, for example, if the money leaves my account on a Monday, it must be received and credited by the end of Tuesday.\"</p> <p>There are no rules covering payments outside of the UK but your bank should be able to tell you what options there are. The more information you have about where the money is going, the quicker and safer the payment will be. Most banks will offer an option where the money will get to its destination within three to five days. Be aware, though, that not all banks or financial institutions offer the full set of options.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 September 2012.

But in the cold light of day I admitted that it's way too big on the shoulders. No matter, I'd&#xa0;add buttons and wear it as a silky, pyjama-style shirt. But laziness, and my inability to trust a dry cleaner to alter it, intervened. Then, last season, the pyjama trend happened. Brilliant, I thought \u2013 finally it would have purpose. But it still had no buttons, and then I&#xa0;became too pregnant to make a&#xa0;silk blouse look right. So many lessons learned: some people are too lazy to alter clothes; something you've never worn can never be a bargain, despite the label. But mostly, jackets and blouses are always better if you can fasten them.</p> <h2>Sarah Curran, CEO, <a href=\"http://www.mywardrobe.com\" title=\"\">mywardrobe.com</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395683354\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/5/1346842823329/Fashion-mistakes-mock-cro-008.jpg\" alt=\"Fashion mistakes: mock-croc YSL shoes\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'I spent a fortune and I wore them only once': Sarah Curran\u2019s YSL mock-crocs gave her vertigo.

It's a beautiful pair of mock-croc \"Tribute\" pumps by YSL I bought three&#xa0;years ago. They are so incredibly high, and I&#xa0;commute every day in heels, but these bad boys just beat me. I spent a fortune and I wore them only once \u2013 the stiletto was just too skinny and the platform too high. I'd nipped out before a lunch to buy my friend a birthday present: I saw them, fell in love, put them on and walked to the restaurant. I&#xa0;realised straight away that they were going to be tricky and, after a couple of glasses of wine, I had to take them off. I can't just get rid of them, though. They are the most expensive pair of&#xa0;shoes I've ever bought, I can't wear them and somehow I can't give them away. Lesson to oneself: don't buy six-inch heels before seeing if you can walk in them.</p> <h2>Emma Hill, creative director, Mulberry </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395683350\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/5/1346842695395/Fashion-mistakes-Chanel-s-008.jpg\" alt=\"Fashion mistakes: Chanel shoes\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'They went back in the box and have remained unworn since': Emma Hill\u2019s \u2018bar-stool\u2019 shoes.

A simple lesson I learned the hard way. I was planning a look for a big event and needed an amazing pair of black heels \u2013 of course, none of the countless pairs of black heels I already had were quite right. I saw a pair of gorgeous Chanel shoes on eBay at a very attractive price, not quite in my size. In an excited shoe-lust-driven haze, I decided there were a few weeks until the event and I could stretch them. When they arrived, they were pinching tight and pretty much caused instantaneous pain. Not to be defeated, I wore them as much as I could at home \u2013 watching TV and doing the cleaning. I even tried using Vaseline to help get them on better, but there was no hope. They went back in the box and have remained unworn since. I call them my \"bar stool shoes\" \u2013 only good for sitting at a bar in and not moving, but they haven't even been used for that. I take my time buying shoes now \u2013 the frustration of something not fitting is too great.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.alicerawsthorn.com/\" title=\"\">Alice Rawsthorn</a>, design critic, International&#xa0;Herald&#xa0;Tribune</h2> <p>Marc Jacobs' \"grunge\" collection for Perry Ellis was the hottest collection of spring 1993. Conceptually, it was brilliant. Grunge music was&#xa0;huge at the time, and he distilled the grunge look of plaid shirts and vintage 1930s tea dresses into beautifully detailed pieces that fit perfectly. American Vogue shot the then-teenage Sofia Coppola wearing most of the collection. She looked fantastic in it but, sadly, when I bought one of the long silk chiffon tea dresses, I didn't. My natural style is sporty mod, and I don't suit floaty, floral, frilly things. I seem to remember paying \u00a3900 for it. I wore it to a party in Tom Dixon's old design studio in Vauxhall, but felt so ridiculous that I never wore it again. A few years later, I had it shortened, hoping to give it a new lease of life. But it just looked slutty, another style I can't carry off, and left me with another regret, that I had vandalised a piece of fashion history \u2013 for nothing.</p> <h2>Claire Wilcox, curator of the <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/page/f/fashion/\" title=\"\">V&amp;A's refurbished fashion galleries</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395683355\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/5/1346843185464/Fashion-mistakes-Lanvin-s-008.jpg\" alt=\"Fashion mistakes: Lanvin shirt\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claire Wilcox wore this Lanvin shirt only once: 'It\u2019s too beautiful and should be in a museum.'

I loved what the present designer Alber Elbaz is doing at the label and I thought it would be brilliant to wear Lanvin to the opening. I went to Harvey Nichols and fell in love with the collection. All I could afford was a petrol blue satin sleeveless shirt. It was much more than I would ever normally pay, but I bought it without even trying it on. I wore it for that night, but never since. It's too beautiful and should be in a museum, and my idea of the kind of person who should wear it is not me.</p> <h2>Kate Bostock, executive director of general merchandise, Marks &amp; Spencer</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395683356\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/5/1346842944340/Fashion-mistakes-basque-008.jpg\" alt=\"Fashion mistakes: basque\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sometimes, it\u2019s not the size or the fit that brings trouble: Kate Bostock just doesn\u2019t have\u00a0the bottle to wear this \u00a3300 Vollers basque corset.

It's not so much a regret as something I wish I had the confidence to wear, but I never have. I bought it three years ago to wear to my youngest son's 18th birthday party. I had planned to wear it with hareem trousers, which were fashionable at the time, but I bottled it at the last moment. At home I have mannequins that I dress to look at for pleasure and it lives there, where it's had lots of compliments. Normally I would have returned it. I've learned that, if you love something, you usually find a way of wearing it within a two-week window. I'm pretty disciplined about that.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/lindagrant\" title=\"\">Linda Grant</a>, writer</h2> <p>When I was shortlisted for the Booker prize, I&#xa0;bought a pair of black silk shoes from LK Bennett. My dress was being made for me by Avsh Alom Gur, then creative director at Ossie Clark. I took them in to show him and the expression on his face was so withering that I&#xa0;put them away quickly. I think they cost \u00a3199. He gave me a pair of Nicholas Kirkwood shoes. I&#xa0;hobbled a few steps in them and said, \"I can't walk in these.\" He pinned me with his eyes. \"These shoes cost \u00a3600. Now can you walk in them?\" I took the LK Bennett shoes back to the shop and got another pair. They were purple patent with a gold buckle. They were too tight. I&#xa0;never wore them and eventually gave them to a charity shop. When I got dressed the night of the Booker, I thought, \"I cannot stand in these Kirkwood shoes for more than two minutes\", so I took them off and wore a pair of Louboutin wedges I'd bought in a Vogue sample sale for Turkish earthquake relief. I gave the Kirkwoods to a friend's daughter who has no trouble striding about in them. I can't quite work out how much all of this cost me, but it doesn't seem to involve me having any new shoes.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jesscartnermorley\" title=\"\">Jess Cartner-Morley</a>, fashion editor, the Guardian</h2> <p>I don't really believe in fashion mistakes. Yes,&#xa0;there are expensive shoes I can't walk in and a yellow silk blouse that makes me look green around the gills \u2013 but the shoes are a work&#xa0;of art&#xa0;and the thought that I might one day&#xa0;achieve&#xa0;the tan to pull off the blouse gives me something to aim for on holiday. So, like Edith Piaf, je ne regrette rien.</p> <p>Except the Milan Jacket.</p> <p>Multicoloured, maximalist and horrendously expensive, the Milan Jacket was boho-luxe as sold on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Monte_Napoleone\" title=\"\">via Montenapoleone</a>. It was one of my first seasons as a fashion editor, and tagging along with the cool girls and trying to fit in, I&#xa0;found myself shopping. Everyone was spending like it was going out of fashion. I tried on the jacket. \"Fabulous!\" everyone cried, to be polite and inclusive. \"I love it!\" I agreed, because that seemed to be the expected answer. I bought it. I&#xa0;never, ever wore it, although it took me five years to face facts and send it to the charity shop.</p> <p>It was a useful mistake. My shopping has been contentedly Lutheran ever since. No one else comes in that changing room but me and my conscience; and that way, for me, shopping happiness lies.</p> <h2>Lorraine Candy, editor-in-chief, Elle</h2> <p>I once had a Laura Ashley tea dress that my friends threw away in a fashion version of being&#xa0;cruel to be kind. It was navy blue with a&#xa0;flower print and puffed sleeves. I took it on holiday to Spain with some girlfriends who were&#xa0;so horrified that, after one day's wear, they threw it away the moment I took it off. It&#xa0;just&#xa0;wasn't me and it offended their sense of&#xa0;me. I love the nostalgia of a tea dress and the&#xa0;delicate prints, but they don't suit me. My&#xa0;shape is very straight, up and down, and you&#xa0;need curves for a tea dress. I keep buying them, though \u2013 especially expensive ones from small boutiques \u2013 hoping one will simply fit and&#xa0;make me look pretty.

I was so excited, walking up and&#xa0;down, foaming at the mouth. I saw this one&#xa0;pair of classic black patent-leather medium-heel Louboutins \u2013 the perfect thing to&#xa0;buy in the&#xa0;sale because they never date.

  "<p>In 1995, the philosophy professor John Perry wrote&#xa0;an&#xa0;essay entitled <a href=\"http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/\" title=\"\">Structured Procrastination</a>, about&#xa0;harnessing the power of procrastination to get things done. Finally, he's got around to expanding it into a book. (Insert joke here.) Published in the UK next&#xa0;month, it's called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Procrastination-The-Lollygagging-Postponing/dp/0761171673/\" title=\"\">The Art Of Procrastination: A Guide To Effective Dawdling, Dallying, Lollygagging And Postponing</a>, and&#xa0;the name of the publisher is... <a href=\"http://www.workman.com/\" title=\"\">Workman</a>. (Insert joke here.) A word of caution: readers of the online version of this column may be tempted to leave a comment saying \"I was going to read this, but I decided to put it off till later.\" Should you do so, I will personally come round and set fire to your house.</p> <p>I mean, when I can be bothered.</p> <p>The gist of Perry's approach was encapsulated by the humorist <a href=\"http://www.quotationspage.com/quotes/Robert_Benchley/\" title=\"\">Robert Benchley</a>: \"Anyone can do any amount of work, provided it isn't the work he's supposed to be doing at that moment.\" As long as your alleged top priority is sufficiently intimidating (\"learn Chinese\"), it'll feel comparatively fun to do something that's actually more important (\"finish philosophy paper\"). Perry recalls his time as a \"resident fellow\" at Stanford, when he'd put off grading essays to chat and play ping-pong with students \u2013 which made him a good resident fellow. Structured procrastination, he concedes, relies on self-deception. But then so do most productivity tricks; at least this one doesn't also rely on trying to stamp out an ingrained personality trait, but on channelling it wisely instead.</p> <p>The book takes this harnessing-your-flaws approach further. If you crave a sense of accomplishment, Perry notes, try adding to your to-do list things you already do, so as to get the fillip of crossing them off. (He recommends a morning list: \"1.&#xa0;Turn off the alarm. 2. Don't hit the snooze button. 3. Get out of bed. 4. Go to the bathroom. 5. Don't get back into bed\" \u2013 five achievements before you've made coffee!) And he celebrates the wondrous phenomenon of Tasks That Just Go Away: delay on certain things and circumstances will render them irrelevant. Sure, you should avoid being \"manipulative and annoying\" by forcing others to fulfil your duties out of desperation. But in any sizeable organisation, there are often several people who could complete a given task. Why should you always be penalised for being helpful?</p> <p>So far, so jovial. But Perry's approach touches on something that's missed by most psychologists: the rebellious urge underlying procrastination isn't always a bad thing. To delay doing what we want to get done seems flatly irrational. Yet such perversity can be an assertion of human autonomy: something a person does, as Dostoevsky writes in <a href=\"http://www.pagebypagebooks.com/Fyodor_Dostoevsky/Notes_from_the_Underground/Part_I_Chapter_VIII_p2.html\" title=\"\">Notes From The Underground</a>, \"to prove to himself... that men are still men and not the keys of a piano, which the laws of nature threaten to control so completely\". Perry himself disdains such grand explanations. But seen this way, today's cacophony of anti-procrastination advice seems rather sinister: a subtle way of inducing conformity, to get you to do what you \"should\" be doing. Structured procrastination turns your rebellion into productivity, so you could argue it's equally conformist. But at least it respects the existence of the urge. And it doesn't let you forget a truth that most productivity gurus ignore: that just because something found its way on to your to-do list, it doesn't necessarily follow that it needs to be done.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com</a> Follow Oliver on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/oliverburkeman\" title=\"\">Twitter</a>.</p>",
  "<p>I'm not sure it's socially acceptable to admit to enjoying driving these days. It's a bit like saying you're into hare coursing. I'm afraid I&#xa0;do, though \u2013 like driving, that is (coursing I don't know \u2013 I've never tried it. I can't imagine I would. I like hares). And cars don't get much more enjoyable to drive than this one.</p> <p>It's not the quickest, the cleverest or the flashiest. That's part of its brilliance. Too many sports cars these days have so much power, and massive fat tyres to keep them on the road, and all sorts of sophisticated electronics to help you keep control, that you may as well not be (in control). It's like driving by proxy.</p> <p>Not so this one. A modest two-litre flat four boxer engine, a little under 200bhp, 151lb ft... sorry, I'm turning into a boy. Basically, it's not very, very powerful. But it's light, with a low centre of gravity, rear-wheel drive, beautifully balanced, precise, accurate. Oh, and those tyres \u2013 they're the same ones they put on a bloody Prius. Meaning you&#xa0;can drift a bit on the corners, if&#xa0;you so wished.</p> <p>And there you have it, the old-fashioned pleasure of driving, Mr Toad style, machine connecting man to road. Poop poop. So maybe you won't get there quite as fast as the fat cats in their supercars. But you will arrive with just as big a smile on your face.</p> <p>Bigger, in fact \u2013 Cheshire to their fat. Not only because you're more in touch with the road, but because bystanders aren't making the internationally recognisable sign for small penis at you as you pass. (I'm assuming these are male drivers;&#xa0;a&#xa0;woman in a supercar is something quite different, and absolutely acceptable).</p> <p>Plus, you've spent a fraction of what they have. Grin per pound, this&#xa0;is about as high as it gets. Apart&#xa0;from a <a href=\"http://www.subaru.com/vehicles/brz/index.html\" title=\"\">Subaru BRZ</a>, perhaps, which is exactly the same car as this one, only ever so slightly more desirable because Subaru is a cooler brand than Toyota.</p> <p>To return \u2013 neatly \u2013 to hare coursing.

Yeah, except that analogy doesn't really work because a Porsche or a&#xa0;Ferrari actually corners quicker, too, even if it may not feel like it, so the hare's going to be caught every time. That's no good.</p> <p>OK, then, how about this: it's not just the steering on the GT86 that's brilliant, the brakes are, too.

  "<p><strong>Marilyn</strong>, by Norman Mailer, read by Jeff Harding (10\u00bdhrs unabridged, Whole Story Audio, \u00a320.41)</p> <p>Mailer on Monroe \u2013 two American icons for the price of one (three if you include Jeff Harding, which audio connoisseurs definitely will) \u2013 this has to be the bargain biography of the year. That's 1973, of course, when it came out, not 2012, but talking book readers are used to waiting and don't complain if it's for something as good as this. Norman Mailer, double Pulitzer prizewinner and author of <em>The Naked and The Dead</em>, was the hard man of American literature. He drank, took drugs, got into fights, married six times, had nine children and loathed women's lib.</p> <p>Marilyn Monroe was, well, Marilyn Monroe, with whom Mailer is clearly bewitched, bothered, bewildered and obsessed. Forget about good biographers having to remain detached. This is the nearest you'll get to literary necrophilia. You can practically hear him panting when he launches into yet another long, voluptuous description of his subject. \"On screen she looked like a sweet peach bursting before one's eyes, a new love ready and waiting between the sheets \u2026 So curvaceous, and yet without menace as to turn one's fingertips into 10 happy prowlers. Sex was, yes, ice-cream to her. 'Take me,' said her smile, 'I'm easy, I'm happy, I'm an angel of sex, you bet.'\"</p> <p>This isn't a standard biography, and Mailer is the first to admit it. Are the facts of someone's life, always supposing you can get them, he wonders, the best way to understand what they were really like, especially with actors who live with lies as if they were truths? In other words, ignore what Marilyn said about herself, since most of the time she was making it up. What is fact is what other people said about her \u2013 Tony Curtis for instance: \"kissing Marilyn was like kissing Hitler\", or director Billy Wilder: \"after working all day with her I feel like going home and beating my wife\", or Laurence Olivier, her co-star in <em>The Prince and The Showgirl</em>: \"the experience aged me 10 years\".</p> <p>It is also a fact that she was always late, if she turned up at all. \"We're ready for you, Miss Monroe,\" came the call during the shooting of <em>Some Like it Hot</em>. \"Go fuck yourself,\" said Marilyn, deep in Thomas Paine's <em>Rights of Man</em>. She always wanted to be taken seriously. As for the much hinted at conspiracy theory about her death \u2013 suicide or murder \u2013 Mailer pulls no punches.

By pulling off&#xa0;the seemingly impossible trick of making her cold, ruthless protagonist, currently bent on avenging the downfall of his former master, Cardinal Wolsey, an even more sympathetic character than he was in part one. Cromwell, son&#xa0;of a Putney butcher, plays the Tudors' favourite political conspiracy game better than any courtier, but he is also a warm, humorous, loving father. \"Sir,\" says Gregory, his son, \"they say that if the abbot of&#xa0;Glastonbury went to bed with the abbess of Shaftesbury, their offspring would be the richest landowners in England.\" \"Very likely,\" he says, \"though have you seen the abbess of Shaftesbury?\" Gregory looks worried. \"Should I have?\" Roll on part three.</p> <p><strong>Fall of Giants</strong>, by Ken Follett, read by John Lee (25hrs unabridged, Audible download, \u00a37.99)</p> <p>You read Follett for the story not the style, none better than this unlikely epic about five families \u2013 English aristos, Welsh miners, German diplomats, Russian peasants and American politicians \u2013 during the first world war.

  "<p>A couple of years ago, <a href=\"http://naomiwolf.org/\" title=\"\">Naomi Wolf </a>signed up to write a book about the vagina. \"I was euphoric, in creative terms \u2026 At the same time I was anxious about grappling with such a strong social taboo.\" A friend of a friend \u2013 \"an impresario whom I will call Alan\" \u2013 throws a party for her in his loft, \"a pasta party at which guests could make vagina-shaped pasta\", an idea Wolf says she finds \"funny and sort of charming\" though \"not a thematic twist I would have chosen for&#xa0;myself\".</p> <p>At the party, \"there was a slightly ominous, mischievous stir\" from the kitchen, where guests have been hard at work: \"Flowery or feathery, fluted or fanned, each small sculpture was detailed and different: lovely little white objects against a hand-painted blue Italian ceramic tray.\" \"I call those 'cuntini', says Alan, laughing.\" \"My heart contracted,\" Naomi responds. Next, she hears a sizzle. \"I got it: ha, sausages \u2026 The room had become tense.\" Then comes the salmon. \"I flushed, with a kind of despair,\" she writes, adding that the evening as a whole left her so upset, she was unable to write a word of her vagina book for the next six months. \"I felt \u2013 on both a creative and a physical level \u2013 that I had been punished for 'going somewhere' that women are not supposed to go\", she&#xa0;writes.</p> <p>\"A Rorschach with legs\" is what Natalie Angier calls the vagina in her superb <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/1999/04/05/angier/\" title=\"\"><em>Woman: An Intimate Geography</em> (1999)</a>. \"You can make of it practically anything you want, need or dread.\" And the same is true, surely, of this sorry tale. Different readers will have different cringe-points, different places in the story at which they start shouting \"Whoah!\" You may be appalled at the thought of a book called <em>Vagina</em> in the first place. How backward-looking, how attention-seeking, can a 21st-century feminist get? You may be fine with vaginas in a book title, less so as a shape of pasta \u2013 most people avoid close-up genital chit-chat in mixed culinary situations, and there are obvious reasons for the taboo. You may find the pasta in theory, as Wolf did, \"sweet\" \u2013 a quick google brings up vagina cupcakes, pink&#xa0;felt vagina knickers, a commercial&#xa0;range of tricolore pasta from Naples cut in genital shapes \u2013 but it's the c-word that upsets you, or the sausages, or the fish. Personally, I particularly disliked the \"impresario whom I will call Alan\", and the \"hand-painted blue Italian ceramic tray\": ugh boasting, ugh sentimental, ugh ugh. I'm not keen on the post-party six-month trauma either. If you're a big enough show-off to have a vagina-pasta party in the first place, I kind of feel you've abjured your right to victimmy tender-plantdom. No doubt that says as much about me and my hangups as it does about anything else.</p> <p>\"I was aware,\" Wolf reports, that when she told people about her topic, \"many people had immediate, probably measurable physical reactions.\" Some \"smiled immediately, beautiful heartfelt smiles\". Others \"looked frightened or disgusted, as if I had suddenly produced from my handbag a trout\". Neither covers my own reaction, though it was closer to <em>Monty Python</em> fish-slapping than the heartfelt-smiling thing. I admire, of course, the force-of-nature whorls in the paintings of <a href=\"http://www.georgiaokeeffe.net/\" title=\"\">Georgia O'Keeffe</a>, the magnificent <a href=\"http://www.sadiecoles.com/current-exhibitions-september.html\" title=\"\"><em>White Hole</em> by Rohan Weallaens </a>in his show with Sarah Lucas, currently showing at Sadie Coles HQ Off-Site.

Catherine Blackledge's much-overlooked <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n22/jenny-diski/its-so-beautiful\" title=\"\"><em>The Story of V</em> (2003)</a> is lucid and thorough, and has some amazing illustrations. On the vagina as symbolic object, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/oct/20/society1\" title=\"\"><em>The Female Thing </em>by Laura Kipnis </a>(2006) is a sharp, funny, leftwing, Freudian essay about the many ways in which \"having one of these things instead of one of the other things \u2026 invariably structures the female experience here on earth\". Most recently, Florence Williams writes in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/13/breasts-florence-williams-review\" title=\"\"><em>Breasts: A Natural and Unnatural History</em></a> (Norton, 2012) about how the life of organs commonly thought of as private is always socially and environmentally conditioned, by the fantasies in the ether around them, by the chemicals they absorb.</p> <p>Wolf's book, however, is something else again. Yes, it does a bit of science, and a bit of cultural history too. But mostly, it doesn't need to, because Wolf has found a magic key. \"The vagina and the brain,\" Wolf has discovered, are \"essentially one network, or 'one whole system'\", though at the moment, not a lot of people know this, apart from \"scientists at the most advanced laboratories and clinics around the world\". Taken together, this \"profound brain-vagina connection\" forms \"a gateway to, and medium of, female self-knowledge and consciousness\", mediating \"creativity and transcendence\". You thought Angier was laying it on a bit when she poeticised the vagina as \"a pause between the declarative sentence of the outside world and the mutterings of the viscera\"? Well, for Wolf it channels \"a sensibility that feels very much like freedom\". Or if that's too much to deal with, just look on it as \"essentially part of the female soul\".</p> <p>This discovery, Wolf writes, \"started as a historical and cultural journey, but quickly became 'personal and necessary'\". In 2009, she says, when she was 46, her life was outwardly great (aren't they always in this sort of story) \u2013 \"emotionally and sexually happy, intellectually excited, and newly in love\". And yet \u2013 as is the convention \u2013 \"something was becoming terribly wrong\". In her 40s, she explains, Wolf had felt her experience of orgasm deepen and become enriched, leading her to \"see colours as if they were brighter\" and \"the connections between things\" more distinctly. In 2009, though, \"this was changing. I was \u2026 losing sensation <em>inside</em> my body.\" Worse, her sense of the \"poetic dimension\" was disappearing too. \"Things seemed discrete and unrelated to me \u2026 and colours were just colours.\" She gets depressed and then despairing: \"It was like a horror movie, as the light and sparkle of the world dialled downward and downward.\"</p> <p>It turns out that Wolf has trapped a nerve in her lower back, between the lumbar region and the sacrum. Normally, this \"pelvic nerve\" carries messages between the brain and the clitoris, cervix and vagina, but in Wolf's case, because of the neural damage, the messages from the vagina were cut off. And yet, she still orgasms from her clitoris, no problem. \"Every woman is wired differently,\" her specialist explains. \"Some women's nerves branch more in the vagina; other women's nerves branch more in the clitoris \u2026 That accounts for some of the differences in female sexual response.\" \"I almost fell off the exam table in astonishment,\" writes the author. \"<em>That's</em> what explained vaginal versus clitoral orgasms? \u2026 Not culture, not upbringing, not patriarchy, not feminism, not&#xa0;Freud?\"</p> <p>Once she has picked herself up again, Wolf organises her argument round two main strands. Science, she discovers, has been making lots of progress in understanding the physiology of female sexuality, but nobody tells us about it. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/02/naomi-wolf-women-orgasm-neural-wiring?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">\"Why didn't they tell us in eighth grade? \u2026 It's changed my whole sense of how we're put together,\" as she said to Emma Brockes in the Guardian this week</a>. But also, this vagina-brain connection has an emotional, even spiritual dimension \u2013 \"a 'hole'\" that is \"Goddess-shaped\", no less. She gets surgery to put her back right, and finds her full-spectrum orgasms restored, and with them, the mystical intimations. \"The moving grasses, the sweeping tree branches, the birds calling from invisible locations in the dappled shadows \u2026 I thought: it is back.\"</p> <p>The first part of the book is called \"Does the Vagina Have a Consciousness?\" Wolf's evidence includes neuroanatomy \u2013 \"your dreamy autonomic nervous system, or what scientists call the ANS\" and neurochemistry \u2013 \"the dopamine, oxytocin and opioids released by (the) orgasm, which in turn affect (the) brain\". The take-home is basically that just as sensation runs from pelvis to brain, so it runs the other way as well, meaning that \"<em>gestures, touches, kisses and words aren't extras</em>. They are integral parts of the activation of the female ANS.\" In other words, Wolf thinks that the sort of sexual pleasure the modern woman is encouraged to seek is far too wham-bam to release women from what she sees as a widespread \"existential depression\", an \"An Epidemic of Female Sexual Unhappiness\".</p> <p>Much of this \"sexual suffering\" Wolf thinks has been systemically imposed on women, across the world and down the centuries: rape and genital mutilation, military, judicial and ritual. \"If you are to subdue and suppress women, and in such a way that they come to do it to themselves \u2026. <em>you must target the vagina</em>.\" There's also an interesting bit on the threat posed to the \"happy heterosexual vagina\" by internet pornography. The evidence isn't entirely there yet, but Wolf's argument that heavy porn use seems to follow an addictive pattern, desensitising users to images of violence and causing them to lose interest in affectionate sex with a partner whose name they know, seems increasingly plausible. Though I'm not sure about the impresario-I-will-call-Alan foodie spin: \"The mass-produced, fast-forward, pornographic vagina is to the real vagina what highly processed or GMO food is to slow or organic food.\"</p> <p>More surprisingly, she also blames \"second-wave feminism\", ie, the work of the early-1970s Women's Liberation Movement. In <a href=\"http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/vaginalmyth.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm</em> (1970)</a>, she says, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Koedt\" title=\"\">Anne Koedt</a> argued that \"Freud's elevation of the vagina over the clitoris\" was a \"patriarchal plot\" in order that women be \"brainwashed into dependency on men\". An understandable move, Wolf thinks, but overstated, and with unfortunate consequences: \"From the 1970s on, the vagina was recast as rather retro, housewifey and pass\u00e9\", whereas the clitoris was \"a glamorous, mini-skirt-wearing Gloria&#xa0;Steinem\".</p> <p>But mainly her target seems to be ordinarily lazy boyfs and hubbies, who, she thinks, have to try much harder when appeasing the \"entirely different model of female sexuality\" she dubs \"the Goddess Array\". The quest takes her deep into the erotic texts of the Tantric, Tao and Islamic traditions. It takes her to a shabby hotel in Midtown Manhattan for a weekend workshop in \"sacred-spot massage\" run by \"the surreally juicy\" <a href=\"http://carolinemuir.com/\" title=\"\">Caroline Muir </a>(\"While all of the women were conventionally attractive, many of the men were not at all\"). It takes her to Chalk Farm in north London to visit <a href=\"http://www.mikelousada.com/\" title=\"\">Mike Lousada</a>, \"the world's nicest former investment banker turned male sexual healer\", famous for having once stared at \"the yoni\" for so long, he saw an image of the Virgin Mary in it. If you want your own \"sacred spot\" expertly rubbed by Muir, Wolf tells us, the hourly rate is $250. Lousada, by contrast, charges only \u00a3100.</p> <p>\u2766</p> <p>I read this book in utter bafflement. What is this big news that Wolf has to impart? Vaginas feel stuff, so yes, of course they must be packed with nerves; and nerves, we know, join up with each other at the spine to link into the brain. That's why they call it the central nervous system; that's what being human<strong> </strong>is all about. Feet, too, join up with the CNS \u2013 thus reflexologists, and why bunions are so painful. And so do the intestines, giving rise to the extremely interesting <a href=\"http://www.emory.edu/EMORY_REPORT/stories/2011/02/people_profile_elizabeth_wilson_scientist_feminist.html\" title=\"\">\"Gut Feminism\" of Elizabeth A Wilson</a> at Emory University in Atlanta \u2013 digestive organs as \"psychically alive\", \"the enteric character\" of mood, \"how biology can be an ally for those of us building models of mind-body that tax the limits of Cartesian dualism\". In other words, the closer you look at attempts to argue that mind and body are <em>not</em> completely wrapped up in each other, the more you will see all sorts of connections, biological and symbolic and liminally teetering in between. \"Having a body punctured by so many openings and canals,\" Kipnis writes, \"blurs the distinction between inside and outside, self and world. The apertures invariably take on emotional resonance \u2026 She's so 'open'. He's a real 'tightass'.\" And of course the c-word, in all its abject force.</p> <p>At the beginning of her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/02/vagina-a-new-biography-naomi-wolf?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\"><em>Vagina</em> book, Wolf</a> says that her theory of \"biological consciousness\" comes in part from William James's mighty <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Varieties_of_Religious_Experience\" title=\"\"><em>The Variety of Religious Experience</em></a> (1902) \u2013 \"the issue of neurology as a substratum for these common mystical experiences\", ie, that particular brain-states may give people a feeling that they are, for a moment, in touch with God. After that, though, she doesn't mention James again. Which is a pity, because one great thing about the James book is the way he doesn't pooh-pooh these passing feelings, while also recognising that any individual attempt to \"locate\" them can only end in idiotic hubris: \"We must frankly recognise the fact that we live in partial systems and that parts are not interchangeable in the spiritual life.\" Those selfish genes with their shoulder-pads, grabbing evolutionary advantages for the alpha males; dopamine and oxytocin, gambolling like SpongeBob SquarePants round the reptile brain; the stories told by the popular-science writers can only ever just be stories, partial facts filled out with cartoonishly consoling fictions.</p> <p>So yes, body and mind are completely part and parcel. But no, this doesn't mean the connections are easy to conceptualise: neither goddesses nor Numskulls nor ghosts in the machine. Remember Wolf's \"astonishment\" when her doctor told her that every woman's pelvic wiring is slightly different? She should be more than astonished, I feel. She should be daunted and delighted at the great polymorphous cloud ahead of her, every individual equal and yet completely different \u2013 vagina and/or clitoris and/or all of these or none; fingers and/or penises and/or hair dryers and/or veg. But Wolf does not want to think about such glories. \"One of my primary themes is the exploration of heterosexual women's physical and emotional interactions with men \u2026 Not because I think that lesbian and bisexual arousal, orgasm, relationships or mind-body connections are any less fascinating,\" but because women are \"so complex and so worthy of careful, individualistic attention that I do not believe that the politically correct approach of lumping all female experience together \u2026 can do justice to the variations of female sexualities and their emotional counterparts.\" Lesbians, anuses and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Dodson\" title=\"\">Betty Dodson </a>do at least get passing mentions. Asexuality, blowjobs, sexual fantasy, do not figure at all.</p> <p>The pulsing cloud becomes particularly shrunken in the neurochemistry chapter. \"People differ from one another at every juncture of the dopamine matrix,\" Angier wrote of \"today's It-neurotransmitter\" a few years ago in the New York Times. \"In the tonal background pace at which their dopamine neurons rhythmically fire, the avidity with which the cells spike in response to need or news \u2026\" For Wolf, on the other hand, dopamine is simply \"the ultimate feminist chemical in the female brain\". Whereas serotonin emerges as a baddie, particularly in its most famous role as the brain-chemical boosted by popular SSRI anti-depressants such as Prozac. \"Women far outnumber men in being prescribed SSRIs. Are these same millions \u2026 warned that SSRIs may well send their libido and ability to experience orgasm plummeting?\" (\"Low sex drive\", I read at second place on the \"Common Side Effects\" page on the NHS Choices website. Wolf may be appalled that many women seem resigned to sexual self-bludgeoning in exchange for the basic ability to keep going, but a lot of evidence suggests they do.) Oxytocin, best known for its part in stimulating childbirth and lactation, she dubs \"the cuddle hormone\" and \"women's emotional superpower\". Top advice for women who \"want to have hot anonymous sex with some guy \u2026 but don't want to fall in love with him \u2026 discourage him from interacting with their nipples.\" Because if he does get his hands on your boobies, you'll have to marry him, obvs!</p> <p>The stuff about rape and sexual violence is just strange. Wolf's main argument \u2013 that rape is at least half-consciously a subordinating tactic deployed by men \u2013 has been feminist orthodoxy since 1975, when Susan Brownmiller published her canonical<a href=\"http://www.susanbrownmiller.com/susanbrownmiller/html/against_our_will.html\" title=\"\"> <em>Against Our Will: Men and Women and Rape</em></a>: \"From prehistoric times to the present, I believe, rape has played a critical function. It is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which <em>all</em> men keep <em>all</em> women in a state of fear.\" And yet, Wolf says that Brownmiller, like others of her generation, writes about rape while following an \"individualised reading of sexuality posited by Freud\", which is surely just not so. Wolf's take on classic women's liberation in general is perverse. Koedt, it's true, did mistakenly write that \"the vagina is not a highly sensitive area\" in her legendary paper. But her main thrust was to open, not close, sexual possibility for women; besides which, other feminists just went as fancy took them. Germaine Greer in 1971, for example: \"To develop the muscles of the pubococcygeal region, think of something nice and contract the buttocks rhythmically \u2026 You might even succeed in making the whole pelvis awake to love and beauty.\"</p> <p>As for this \"gendered sense of self that is shining, without damage, without anxiety or fear\", this \"radiant part of the universal feminine\" that is activated by obeisance to the \"Goddess Array\" \u2026 What if you're a woman who practises forms of sex that bypass the vaginal? What if you were born without a vagina, or with two vaginas, or have a female-looking vulva, but are intersex inside? What if you are biologically and culturally female, but want to smirk or vomit at the very thought of a \"Goddess\" anywhere near you? What happens to \"the universal feminine\" then?</p> <p>Naomi Wolf, presumably, is like many of us, a middle-aged woman who has been thinking a lot about spiritual matters, as middle-aged women often do. Her body has been changing \u2013 which also happens \u2013 and in her case, she's also had that miserable injury, which yes, I can see would make you look at your sexuality anew. But it takes a particular way of looking at things to extrapolate from that to the shining Goddess. Wolf, this book tells us, has also been looking at images of sexual awakening in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/25/poem-week-goblin-market-rossetti\" title=\"\">Christina Rossetti </a>and <a href=\"http://www.katechopin.org/\" title=\"\">Kate Chopin</a>, because she has recently gone \"back to graduate school\". And discussing orgasmic rats with \"a group of brilliant young women\" at \"a cottage on an old farm\". Chatting with Mike Lousada for \"a London newspaper\". And visiting, in 2004, a refugee centre for women raped during the civil war in Sierra Leone. All evidence, one way or another, for this spiritual-emotional-neurological network. All of it really just connected by the life, the interests and the ego of Naomi Wolf herself.</p> <p>\u2766</p> <p>Back in 1990, I remember watching the young Wolf on television, with a panel of older feminist writers, discussing her first book, the bestselling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/sep/01/society2\" title=\"\"><em>The Beauty Myth</em> (1990)</a>. These older feminists \u2013 I can't remember who any of them were \u2013 were being just horrible. Their gist was that Wolf, being 28 and good-looking and well groomed, had no right to speak out about any \"beauty myth\", or to call herself a feminist at all. Awful, I remember thinking, but also interesting \u2013 the way older women so often hate letting the younger ones have their turn. I wrote an article about it for a long-dead magazine called City Limits, which was where I was working, in my first London job.</p> <p>And I guess that must be why I have a fuzzy memory of an evening shortly after, when Wolf came for tea to my Brixton house-share, together with my friend and then City Limits colleague, now Guardian columnist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/deborah-orr\" title=\"\">Deborah Orr</a>. It was a nice evening, I remember; I made a huge spanakopita and Wolf was lovely. Only then, Deborah or I said something mildly critical of some point or another, and Wolf fought back. The forcefulness, the mental agility, the lack of embarrassment! The sense of entitlement and mission, the self-belief! It was quite an insight into what it takes to be a celebrity feminist. I immediately saw that I would never cut it. And so, more than 20 years later, I'm still bodging my spanakopitas in south-east London while Wolf has long been a figure of world renown.</p> <p>After <em>The Beauty Myth</em>, Wolf wrote a sort of sequel to it, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/assessment/1999/11/naomi_wolf.html\" title=\"\"><em>Fire With Fire</em></a> \u2013 her own attempt to work out why feminists so often seem to hate each other and what to do about it. The decade subsequent, she published three memoir-based personal-is-political numbers, <em>Promiscuities</em> \u2013 herself and her friends as teenagers; <em>Misconceptions</em> \u2013 as young mothers; <em>The Tree House </em>\u2013 as burnt-out middle-agers, a condition Wolf remedied by doing up her country house with the help of her old dad. Throughout, I watched her from a distance, observing how tough the job of celebrity feminist can be: you have to keep publishing and opining, no matter whether you have much you really want to say. You have to present your ideas to public scrutiny even if they're still half-baked. A single wobble, and the media will leap \u2013 do a google, for example, on Naomi Wolf-Katy Perry. Naomi Wolf-abortion-New Republic. Naomi Woolf-Al Gore-consultant. Naomi Wolf-New York magazine-Harold Bloom. Naomi Wolf-rape-Julian Assange. Then after <em>The Tree House</em>, Wolf suddenly moved sideways, with two plain, useful books on civil liberties and the right to protest in the age of George W Bush. Neither <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2007/11/28/the_end_of_america_feminist_social\" title=\"\"><em>The End of America</em> (2007) </a>nor <a href=\"http://naomiwolf.org/2008/09/give-me-liberty-a-handbook-for-american-revolutionaries/\" title=\"\"><em>Give Me Freedom</em> (2008)</a> was published in this country, but readers will have heard about them when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/nov/25/shocking-truth-about-crackdown-occupy\" title=\"\">Wolf was arrested \u2013 in her evening clothes \u2013 at an Occupy! demonstration in New York City last year</a>. (Good-oh, I remember thinking when I saw it. Now, though, I catch myself checking dates and wondering about the state of her pelvic nerve.)</p> <p>Between jobs, I guess Wolf has never stopped trying to think big thoughts about women and politics and feminism. How some things change and others don't. How the same things need to be said afresh for every generation, and how hard it is to bear this, as you yourself get older and feel you've heard it all before. How much you'd like to warn the youngsters, except that all they hear when you try it is their utter conviction that they themselves will never end up like you. Exhaustion, irritation, frustration at all these goldfish-brain debatelets, repeating themselves, round and round. In a world with Jessie J and Jamie Clayton in it, Caster Semenya and the work of Judith Butler, why are we still letting one of the Anglophone world's most famous feminists waste everyone's time with all this burble about the \"universal feminine\" with its \"Goddess-shaped\" hole?</p> <p>Funnily enough, it was on this very topic that Laura Kipnis's vagina book began. \"Female progress \u2013 how's that going? Let's see. Gender barriers have largely crumbled (some exceptions remain), the dominant paradigms of patriarchy have mainly eroded (some exceptions remain), women have increasing economic dependence from men if they choose to (though many don't). But then you keep stumbling across the tracks of a certain \u2026 <em>ambivalence</em>. No, not the backlash against feminism \u2013 I mean the ambivalence among women themselves.\" For Kipnis, the big problem with feminism \u2013 an open, bold, modern movement, aimed at getting power for women, fair and square \u2013 is that it gets confused with femininity, an ancient, occult body of lore women use to trick men into looking after them; and few of even the most famous feminists have entirely clarified the difference. Or as Kipnis puts it: \"Feminism ('don't call me honey, dickhead') and femininity ('I just found the world's best push-up bra!') are in a big catfight, nowhere more than within each individual female psyche.\"</p> <p>Kipnis would probably see in Wolf's book just another iteration of the basic problem. The main reason for the current \"epidemic of sexual sorrow\" is not so much that \"the vagina is being disrespected\", but that women who should know better underestimate the complexity of Kipnis's \"female thing\" \u2013 \"the female psyche of course\", as Kipnis puts it, the experience of living with \"this small furry thing\" in a world that doles out privilege according to anatomy at birth. So yes, nobody disagrees that women are, on the whole, sad and rancorous, and that the problem amounts to what Wolf calls an \"existential depression\". If not the yoni, under the Tantric management of Mike Lousada, what other wisdoms are there to save us now?</p> <p>\"I had to say The Force,\" Wolf told the Sunday Times, when they asked for her favourite word for the vagina. And maybe it was that, or maybe it was the bit in Kipnis about the \"small furry thing\", but the vision that came to me at this point was the <em>Star Wars</em> poster on the wall of my son's bedroom, a picture of Yoda with a book tucked under his arm. \"Read and The Force is with you,\" it says; it's an ad from the American Library Association. And also a reminder \u2013 not for the first time \u2013 that in the struggle for good sex over all the evils of the universe, the most potent and far-reaching weapons are not vaginas or any other bodily organs, but research, ideas, thinking \u2013 not yonis or even \"the Goddess\", but carefully weighed and thought-through words.</p>",
  "<p>When Pat Barker came to talk about her novel <em>Regeneration</em> at the Guardian book club at the Edinburgh International Book festival, the discussion was a good deal more historical than literary. This might have had something to do with the fact that the novel's main setting, Craiglockhart War Hospital, was within walking distance of the Festival site. Some of the novel's historical characters even had a local existence: one reader pointed out that Captain Brock, who treated Wilfred Owen for shell shock at the hospital, has a street named after him in Queensferry. There seemed some shared feeling that the novel was itself a work of history and not just an ingenious example of historical fiction.</p> <p>The very first member of the audience to describe his response to the novel declared: \"I don't actually read fiction; I only read factual books.\" It was clear that Barker's use of \"real\" historical characters in her novel has imbued it with a certain factuality. Historians have ruefully acknowledged that her trilogy has become a hugely influential \"source\" of historical understanding. Another member of the audience spoke of the novel convincingly \"getting inside a period of total social change\". How much of the author's purpose had it been to do justice to a historical period, not just the experience of war? \"Was I trying to represent a society in complete upheaval? Yes,\" she answered emphatically. She was especially interested in the ways in which sexual roles were re-evaluated, and had partly written her trilogy to explore this.</p> <p>Barker prefaced more than one of her responses to questions with \"In fact \u2026\" \u2013 it was one small sign that, at every stage, the shape of her fiction had to be made consistent with what her research had unearthed. Her readers realised this clearly enough. \"I was especially impressed by the extent and depth of your research,\" remarked one. He was interested to know whether Barker had spoken to any of the descendants of Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen, the poets she brings to fictional life in <em>Regeneration</em>. (She had met one of Owen's uncles.) But the stuff of her fiction came from archives. She had sat in Oxford studying the manuscript of Owen's \"Anthem for Doomed Youth\" and turned Sassoon's scrawled suggestions \u2013 many of which were accepted by Owen \u2013 into dialogue. Another reader wanted to know about the material on Melanesia, where William Rivers did anthropological research before the war. Did this also come from specific research?</p> <p>Yes. Establishing depth of character meant \"digging\" out the intellectual background, reading more books.</p> <p>Quite a few questions tested the novelist's own responses to the attitudes of soldiers. One reader asked Barker whether men at the front despised men at home for not being at the front, or for not ever being able to know what conditions were like.</p> <p>The novelist answered with the confidence of a historian who knew her&#xa0;primary sources. She mentioned letters written home from the front that were designed to reassure families at home. What about grief \u2013 and the many families that were changed for ever by the deaths of their young men? Barker thought that this sense of loss \u2013 of \"spaces at the family table\" \u2013 become stronger as the years went by after the end of the war. She thought that this growing sense of absences explained the \"rash of books\" about the first world war (including her own) that appeared towards the end of the 20th century.</p> <p>One questioner spoke of having met Harry Patch, \"the final Tommy\", the first world war veteran who died in 2009. This reader worried aloud about whether forgetfulness of the war would succeed commemoration. The author decidedly thought not. The dead were always young, and remained so in our imaginations in the writings that came out of that war. She was asked what had first aroused her interest in the first world war, and she talked of how both her grandfather and her step-father had fought in it. Did she have any sympathy with Sassoon's view that by 1917 the war was being conducted \"in the personal interests of a small minority of influential people\"? (<em>Regeneration</em> begins with the consequences of anti-war Sassoon's \"Declaration\".) To the surprise of some of her readers, Barker declined to take any side on this. As a novelist, she had to see the merits of Rivers's view that the war needed to be fought, and needed to be fought to a victorious end. Within the novel's narrative logic, Sassoon cannot simply be \"right\", for then she would lose the conflict on which the novel depends.</p> <p>\u2022 John Mullan is professor of English at University College London.

  "<p><sup>\"</sup>Even if you're a really good swimmer,\" says Lawrence Norfolk, \"you're not going to be able to swim the Pacific. You're going to fail. And I found myself in the middle of the Pacific.\" The 48-year-old novelist is explaining why, five years ago, he abandoned the most complex novel that he, or perhaps anyone else, has ever attempted to write. \"I took on more than I could cope with. With hindsight it was a work of insanity, but it seemed like a good idea at the time.\"</p> <p>Provisionally entitled <em>The Levels</em>, the&#xa0;novel had three settings \u2013 Britain at the end of its Roman era, the second world war and 1981. \"It was so complex that it became exponentially more difficult with every sentence.\" The cast&#xa0;list for each time-frame had four or five major characters and 40 or 60 minor characters. \"Everything that happens resonates. As soon as a character does something in Roman times that has three or four effects in the war section and another 10 or 12 effects in the 1981 section. It was impossible to control and the more I wrote, the more the ending got further&#xa0;away.\"</p> <p>Even then, though, Norfolk, who is superbly confident in his own abilities, refused to give up. \"With every book that I've written there's been a moment where I've thought I've gone wrong and I don't see how I can fix it. Not that I <em>can't</em> fix it.\" Norfolk made his name as a 27-year-old tyro with <em>Lempri\u00e8re's Dictionary</em> in 1991. He was compared by Malcolm Bradbury to Pynchon and Eco. Louis de Berni\u00e8res called him a genius. Granta listed him as one of 20 Best of Young British Novelists. He followed it up with two other similarly vast and architectonically impressive novels, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/popesrhinoceros.htm\" title=\"\"><em>The Pope's Rhinoceros</em> (1996)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/sep/16/fiction.reviews5\" title=\"\"><em>In the Shape of a Boar </em>(2000)</a>, often virtuosically using different interfusing narrative time-frames; with each book, he believed he could write himself out of the mess he'd written himself into. \"Every time I've just continued in the belief that if you just keep working at something it'll come right. <em>Lempri\u00e8re's Dictionary</em> seemed to go really wrong about a third of the way in, but there's no trace of that in the finished book. This time I was right to feel hopeless.\"</p> <p>We're sitting in the kitchen of his west London home, where Norfolk lives with his wife, biochemist Vineeta Rayan and their two sons. The painful remembrance of what he calls \"the novel that died\" was prompted by me asking what he's been up to for the past&#xa0;12 years since the publication of his last book. He's just given me the long answer. \"There's a short answer, which is I had a novel which imploded, a film that didn't get funded and two kids.\" His sons Lucas and Joseph (to whom he dedicates his new novel) notwithstanding, it's been a period of setbacks. That film, for instance, was based on Norfolk's screenplay of the <em>Iliad</em> written at the behest of his friend,&#xa0;director Philip Haas. \"We didn't&#xa0;have enough money for Troy or for a single chariot,\" he says. Billy Connolly and then Mandy Patinkin were to play Zeus, while Jessica Lange and then Helen Hunt were slated to play Hera. The project collapsed, leaving Norfolk with arguably the most promising adaptation of a literary classic to go unfilmed since Pinter scripted Proust.</p> <p>Norfolk insists that literary setbacks are part of the territory. \"Unless there's a possibility of failure, what you're doing isn't actually art.\"</p> <p>After he realised <em>The Levels</em> had definitively failed, he had a bracing meeting with his agent Carole Blake. She asked him if he had any other ideas. \"I said: 'There's this boy and he's an orphan and he becomes a chef in the 17th century. He falls in love with the wrong girl. The civil war happens so he loses everything but they can be together. Then when the Restoration happens, he gets everything back: he can be the greatest chef of the age and she can be lady of the manor and they have to decide what to do.' Carole&#xa0;said:&#xa0;'Well&#xa0;what do they do?' I didn't know at that point but I knew I&#xa0;had to write the book to find out.\"</p> <p>He's spent the past five years doing that. The result, a typically Norfolkian tome of a historical novel dense in research and intellectual ambition, is called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=john+saturnall%27s+feast&amp;tag=googhydr-21&amp;index=stripbooks&amp;hvadid=13048914008&amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;hvexid=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=6735171731606404351&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;ref=pd_sl_9kwq51vsi_e\" title=\"\"><em>John Saturnall's Feast</em></a>. It's the story of the eponymous chef during the religious and ideological ferment of Charles I's reign, the civil war, the protectorate and the restoration. Norfolk's first English-set novel has an <em>Upstairs Downstairs</em> storyline. The wrong girl is Lady Lucretia Fremantle, headstrong daughter of the lord of the manor in whose cavernous subterranean kitchens Saturnall works.</p> <p>One catalyst for the book was his friend <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/oct/07/booksonhealth.features\" title=\"\">Kate Colquhoun's <em>Taste: The Story of Britain Through Its Cooking</em></a>. Norfolk was impressed by her disinterring of pre-Cromwellian cuisine. \"It was incredibly sophisticated. When Kate got to the civil war her narrative basically stops because it's war \u2013 there's nothing to be said about the cuisine. It's actually a pretty boring chapter but I read it avidly and imagined a chef whose professional life is stopped by war. What would you do if you were John Saturnall? Suddenly the bottom has fallen out of your world. The book goes backwards and forwards from that crisis moment.\" He also sought tips from restaurateur David Moore of Pied-\u00e0-Terre on how big kitchens work.</p> <p>Norfolk's novels have always expanded their readers' vocabularies, and <em>John Saturnall's Feast</em> is no exception, but with this twist: the new words you'll learn are overwhelmingly obsolete ones commonplace in the gentry's kitchens of early 17th-century England. Here there are varieties of apples called Quodling and (my favourite) Genet. There's maslin bread, manchet bread and horse bread. There are sallets, dariole-cases, kickshaws and maunds.</p> <p>Each chapter is prefaced with a recipe ostensibly from the John Saturnall cookbook. It isn't quite Nigella. \"Next take the cold Cream, warm Honey and a Ladder,\" counsels the recipe for Baked Quodling Apples served with a sweet Cream. \"Climb the Ladder Pour the Honey and Cream into a Pot of Gascon wine and let it froth, the higher the better.\" During war's lean years, Saturnall is forced to forage for chestnuts for bread. In one scene, he seduces Lucretia from her fast (which she began in protest about being betrothed to a twit from a neighbouring manor) with dishes devised to titillate her palate; in another, which takes place during food shortages, he describes the dishes she can no longer taste. The seducer is in both cases an artist \u2013 wooing the lady with the fruits of his imagination.</p> <p>Norfolk's novel is unexpectedly voguish. Foraging has been the last word in cuisine since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/apr/26/rene-redzepi-noma-best-restaurant\" title=\"\">2010 when Danish restaurant Noma beat Ferran Adri\u00e0's elBulli and Heston Blumenthal's the Fat Duck to become supposedly the world's best restaurant</a>. Lab-based, molecular cuisine was over, supplanted by a cuisine based on foraging. \"You've got to be kidding,\" says Norfolk when I put this to him. \"The foraging in my book is about starvation rations.\"</p> <p>Norfolk was more interested in trying the seemingly impossible, to get into the psychology of 17th-century England by means of the politics of its food. \"Making bread is hard \u2013 I know this because I occasionally bake. It's hard to make a loaf let alone six loaves a day. There's some equation between labour cost and snob value.\" It is always part of his aim to enter into the psychology of a historical period through research and imagination. \"It's usually about two-thirds of the way through a book I think: 'I'm there! I'm right in the&#xa0;17th century! The End.' So it's frustrating.\"</p> <p>Is that true of all your books? \"They're all imperfect. You never finish a book, you just abandon it. Donna Tartt said: 'I'm the sort of person who's quite happy to push a semi-colon around a sentence for an afternoon.' I'm not quite like that, but there are a couple of sentences in <em>Lempri\u00e8re</em> I still go back to and rearrange in my head. I'm not unhappy with the big things.\"</p> <p>One of the big things Norfolk attempts in <em>John Saturnall's Feast</em> is to explore how religions try to codify humanity's most basic drives. What may come across as a novel indicting Protestantism's suppression of fun, sex and good food (it's Protestant groups who smash up the manor and lay waste to its subterranean kitchens where Saturnall finesses his culinary skills; it's civil war that destroys his supply lines and thwarts his surreptitious affair with Lucretia), is really a broader exploration of control. His argument borrows from Freud: \"There are two primary impulses \u2013 to eat and to reproduce and all human psychology has to start with that. We ate before we prayed. The church knew that and so do moralists of all flavours. They always sought to regulate those two primary impulses because they couldn't ban them.\"</p> <p>Against religious control, Norfolk pits the myth of a pre-lapsarian feast, a saturnalia at whose table everybody \u2013 regardless of class, race, creed or tastes in facial hair \u2013 could take their place. \"At the root of all these pagan rituals is a feast. That legacy has been bizarrely twisted through Christianity. I mean the idea that you cannibalise Christ is a deeply odd idea.\"</p> <p>In <em>The Levels</em>, Norfolk had imagined that pagan ritual feast under threat as the Romans leave Britain. A woman called Bellicca strives to hold on to all the civilising plants and culinary techniques the Romans brought here. \"She escapes the barbarians who rose to power after the Romans. She brings all these plants that the Romans introduced, a sort of Ark of the Mediterranean civilisation, to the head of the valley in Somerset.\"</p> <p>In <em>John Saturnall's Feast</em> this Bellicca provides the deep mythic backdrop to the 17th-century storyline. At the start of the novel, we find English villagers still arguing over the meaning of that myth of a pagan tradition that once thrived in Somerset. Protestant sects take Bellicca to have been a witch banished from Somerset by a Christian hero. Young Saturnall's mother, widely suspected of being a witch thanks to her herbalist skills and mastery of culinary arcana, is the last guardian of this feast and its recipes, and so an outlaw figure. Her bequest to John is to&#xa0;remember the recipes and nurture the feast. Which is why he has to become a cook \u2013 to try to bring a saturnalia to repressed England. The clue is in his surname.</p> <p>Neither of two great 17th-century English thinkers, Milton and Hobbes, is named in this novel but they stalk its pages. The feast Norfolk imagines is a rebuff to <em>Paradise Lost</em>, in which Milton imagines the original place of plenitude and bliss, Eden, as eternally tainted by our desire to eat what we shouldn't. As for Hobbes, who fled civil war into exile and who imagined that in a state of nature human life was nasty, brutish and short, Norfolk argues \"he generalised from his own historical position, which was situated in war. We have a view of the past which is historiographically bent towards the unpleasant. Hobbes's idea is people were killing each other all the time. That's what was reported. Neighbour says hello to neighbour wasn't reported. My idea is to get to the past that was unreported.\"</p> <p>This is what he's always done, Norfolk says, in his historical fictions, to imagine the hitherto unnarrated past. \"I think about the people who didn't win \u2013 the deep background to this book is these people and where they lived.\"</p> <p>Norfolk was born in London in 1963 but moved soon after with his parents to Iraq, where his father was employed as a civil engineer. Most of his father's works, Norfolk said later, were destroyed by allied cruise missiles. They were evacuated to England following the 1967 six-day war. He spent his formative years in the West Country, where <em>John Saturnall's Feast</em> is set. After reading English at Kings College London he did a PhD on John Ashbery's poetry. In 1989, his then girlfriend told him to get an agent. So he accosted one at the London book fair and presented her with a synopsis of <em>Lempri\u00e8re's Dictionary</em>. He might have remained unpublished but for the agent shouting after him \u2013 Norfolk had omitted to write down his name, address and telephone number. <em>Lempri\u00e8re's Dictionary</em> was a hit. \"Literary success is mysterious. A 500-page novel about a dead dictionary writer with no sex? My book sold more than anybody would think. In Germany it was on the bestseller lists for nine months.\"</p> <p>Suddenly, aged 27, he was rich. \"I got this huge wodge of cash and thought I could buy all the things I'd ever wanted. So I sat down to write a list. Number one: posh stereo. Number two: I just stared. I couldn't think of anything else. I didn't want a car or a house so I put it in a bank and went to America.\"</p> <p>So he left London for Chicago, where there was a lab at which his girlfriend, now wife, wanted to work. There he wrote <em>The Pope's Rhinoceros</em>. They returned after three years and started a family. <em>In The Shape of a Boar</em>&#xa0;followed.</p> <p>Can Norfolk imagine writing fiction that involved no research and had no historical setting? \"I can't. I'm interested in the first instance in things that are remote from me.\" What an odd impulse, and yet it's one that, Norfolk discovers again and again, undoes itself as he writes: \"I've begun all my books with the intention of writing about something that has nothing to do with me. As I begin writing, the shadow creeps up behind me and finally engulfs me and I realise that everything I'm writing in the book is autobiographical \u2013 it's all about me! Lempri\u00e8re lived 200 years ago, on Jersey. I somehow managed not to see that he's the same age as me, he moves to London from a rural environment, he writes dictionary entries \u2013 as I was doing at that point.\"</p> <p>The same is true of <em>John Saturnall's Feast</em>, which starts with the young John being bullied by boys from a Protestant sect in his village because they believe his mother to be a witch. Not, you understand, that Norfolk's late mother was a witch. \"I realised that some of these things actually happened to me. I was bullied, ignored and ostracised \u2013 all things that happened to John Saturnall and for similar reasons. I was the smart kid and probably deserved it \u2013 I certainly got it.\"</p> <p>Even writing meticulously about Saturnall's work in the kitchens has an autobiographical dimension. \"When you bake a loaf of bread why put a cross on the top? Well, partly it's to relieve the tension, but also it's art. There's a dimension beyond just function and that's art. I realised I was having this argument with myself about what is this thing called art. It was only apparent to me when I'd more or less finished writing the book.\"</p> <p>Most tellingly of all, Norfolk found he was writing about his relationship with his mother, Shirley Blake, through the storyline of supposed witch and errant son. \"There are many parallels.\" She taught you to cook? \"Yeah, and I put that in the acknowledgments, which is the last thing I wrote. Gruesomely, she was taken ill a month after I wrote that and died soon afterwards.\" The novel's acknowledgments, in fact, pay tribute to many of the women in his life for getting him through the last 12 years \u2013 his agent, his mother, his friend Kate and, no doubt most importantly, his wife \"who scooped me off the kitchen floor and whose faith restored my own\". After I read this to Norfolk, he says: \"There are all these women who sorted me out. Otherwise I'd still be on a kitchen floor \u2013 it's just a matter of which kitchen.\"</p>",

  "<p>I'm at Duke House, a rare boutique B&amp;B in the heart of Cambridge, and the owners, the irrepressible Liz and Rob Cameron, are about to take me on a bat safari. They've only been running the B&amp;B since Easter. Liz used to be a teacher: \"But I didn't feel committed and was crap at it,\" so they decided to open their home to strangers instead. They're clearly doing a good job as they're already listed in the top three B&amp;Bs in Cambridge. \"We're on the podium,\" says Rob, with a grin.</p> <p>They're great company and I'm looking forward to our evening out. We're going up the river Cam on Behemoth punts, grander than average, and shall be striking away from the city towards the village of Grantchester. Our punter is Saad Tahir: he's a second year economics student and his slight frame has me wondering whether he's going to manage to shove the Behemoth anywhere, let alone to Grantchester. \"I fell in on my test day,\" he tells me, hands clasped politely behind his back. \"But it was very windy, and raining.\"</p> <p>I stare at him.</p> <p>\"I didn't fall in on the re-test though,\" he adds, quickly.</p> <p>As dusk is drawing in, Saad shoves us off. It's a fine evening but blankets and umbrellas are provided in case it turns chilly or wet, and we're each handed a bat detector. It's a bit like an old-fashioned handheld transistor radio that converts sonar signals into audible frequencies.</p> <p>Different species of bat operate at varying frequencies and a trained ear is able to distinguish each bat's call. There's no hope of me being able to do this but, thankfully, we have a member of the <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/\" title=\"\">Wildlife Trusts</a> on board who is able to do all the explaining.</p> <p>\"Bats,\" Deborah Marchant, our expert guide, tell us, \"are vital to the ecosystem. They control crop pests, they pollinate flowers and they drop fruit seeds. If you've ever used balsa wood or chewed gum or drunk tequila,\" she adds, \"then you can thank bats. If you've got drunk on tequila, that's your own fault.\"</p> <p>Turns out it's the <a href=\"http://www.yearofthebat.org/\" title=\"\">International Year of the Bat</a> and this safari is part of a drive to raise awareness of a much maligned, misunderstood and often persecuted small mammal. It's news to nobody that bats have a terrible reputation. We have Bram Stoker to thank for that, along with their endless association with witches and other murky things of the night but the truth of the matter is, all bats in the UK are interested in is eating vast quantities of insects.</p> <p>\"They need to consume 3,000 insects a night just to stay alive,\" Deborah tells us. \"This summer has been terrible for them. It's not been warm enough to generate enough insects. We've had a lot of dehydrated, exhausted bats. You often find them on the floor. They're disorientated. If you find one, you can call the <a href=\"http://www.bats.org.uk/pages/batcare.html\" title=\"\">Bat Conservation Trust</a>. They'll come and save them.\"</p> <p>Suddenly, there's a loud chatter on Rob's bat sensor. It's a rapid clicking noise and we all crane round to see a fast-darting black smudge sweep across our field of vision. \"That's a Daubenton,\" Deborah tells us. \"They can live for 22 years.\"</p> <p>As it gets darker and the water below us turns the colour of treacle, our bat sensors come alive. Deborah leans forward and shines a torch out across the water and as she does so, the river surface becomes animated with thousands of flying insects. It's wonderfully gothic: gnarled branches of low hanging trees dripping over the shore line, bats diving all around and the single&#xa0;beam of light stretching off into the darkness.</p> <p>\"This is how horror films start,\" I&#xa0;mumble to Rob as we silently glide past dense undergrowth. \"I keep expecting a face to suddenly appear. And then disappear. And then reappear but with an idiosyncratic killing tool.\"</p> <p>\"First rule of horror films \u2013 don't split up. We'll be fine,\" says Rob, reassuringly.</p> <p>\"Watch out, Saad,\" says the punter to our left. \"Dead Man's Corner coming up.\"</p> <p>\"Don't worry,\" says Rob, turning to me, \"it's only called that because of all the dead men.\"</p> <p>\"Oh look,\" says Liz, pointing, as we round the corner. \"That's something you don't see every day.\" There's a cow standing on the towpath and he's eating out of a bin. It's like a secret insight into what cows get up to at night.</p> <p>\"Vampire cows,\" I whisper and then make a mental note to turn that into a film idea immediately.</p> <p>The bat safari lasts around 90&#xa0;minutes and despite being eaten alive by insects (top tip: take insect repellent) it's a gloriously peaceful and relaxing way to spend an evening. Children will love it too, especially the bat sensors, so all in all, a top-notch family outing.</p> <p>Now then. Vampire Cows. I'm thinking George Clooney?

  "<p>We've flown into Kuala Lumpur with the intention of going <em>jalan-jalan</em>, or on the road to the Malays. I lived in KL, as everyone calls this crazy metropolis, for five years, and it is still like a second home. But this time there is no hanging around, as my wife and I are setting out towards the northern border with Thailand, through the heartland of the Malay peninsula.</p> <p>This part of the country is often overlooked by tourists, who prefer the golden beaches of the east coast or paradise islands such as Tioman or Langkawi. Our final destination will be Penang, an island my Malaysian friends tell me has suddenly become one of south-east Asia's hottest destinations.</p> <p>KL is the modern face of Malaysia, a skyscraper city of the future, where Blade Runner meets Bollywood. There are few reminders of the complex history of a country that declared independence from Britain only 55 years ago. Driving out of the centre we soon find ourselves lost in a sprawling urban mass as intimidating as Los Angeles, and it is only with a little luck that we reach the busy north-south highway.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395818423\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/5/1346846141519/Kuala-Lumpur-station-001.jpg\" alt=\"Kuala Lumpur station\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kuala Lumpur station</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The road is surrounded on both sides by rolling hills, marked by geometric lines of palm oil and rubber plantations. The scene resembles an Escher drawing, and there is little trace of the dense rainforest that once covered most of Malaysia. After we've been going an hour, the landscape changes suddenly and dramatically, with massive limestone outcrops leaping hundreds of craggy feet out of the flat plains. Up on a hill, a giant but rather tatty billboard announces that we have arrived at Ipoh \u2013 City of Millionaires, and our first stop-off.</p> <p>Soon we are sitting in the legendary Sinhalese Bar, the sole Sri Lankan bar in Malaysia, whose decor is unchanged since it opened in 1931. I'm sipping a Tiger beer in an iced glass so cold it almost takes the skin off my fingers, and talking to our guide for the next few days, Hong Law Siak, who runs the local heritage association.</p> <p>\"People tend to forget that the modern, developed Malaysia owes its existence to the riches generated by tin and rubber,\" Hong says. \"And in those days Ipoh was as important as Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.\"</p> <p>But when the bottom dropped out of the tin market in the 1980s, Ipoh missed out on all the development that so radically altered the face of KL.</p> <p>\"So instead of glitzy, high-rise office blocks and space-age shopping malls, Ipoh has remained pretty much unchanged from the pioneer era. The traditional Chinese shop-houses have been left intact, as have grand colonial landmarks like the Anglo-Moorish railway station, known here as the Taj Mahal of Ipoh.\"</p> <p>We leave the bar and wander along the street. Hong points out ornate Chinese clan houses, an abandoned photographer's studio with 1960s black and white prints in the window and a Madras textile shop, where the aged assistants still wear dhotis, scribble sales into a dusty, giant ledger, and an ancient poster on the wall proclaims that their checked sarongs were once Made in British India.</p> <p>We disappear down the narrow Panglima Lane \u2013 known as Concubine Lane when it was lined with gambling and opium dens, brothels and the discreet residences of the many concubines kept by rich Chinese tin tycoons. I'm not surprised when Hong tells me that Ipoh was used as a backdrop for the French film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104507/\" title=\"\">Indochine</a>, starring Catherine Deneuve, about the final days of French colonial rule.</p> <p>Discovering the eclectic cuisine of Malaysia is always one of the most exciting parts of travelling here, and Ipoh is no exception. Hawker stalls around Pasar Besar, the teeming wet market, specialise in <em>kway teow</em> \u2013 wok-fried rice noodles with egg, prawns and juicy cockles \u2013 pork satay, paper-thin <em>poh piah</em> spring rolls stuffed with bean sprouts, and claypot chicken. Indian restaurants offer a dozen different curries around a mountain of rice on a banana leaf. But the best meal we eat here is Malay <em>nasi kandar</em>, a self-service feast of at least 40 dishes, where a plate heaped with delicious okra and bitter gourd, spicy beef <em>rendang</em>, squid and fish curry costs less than two pounds.</p> <p>The next day, Hong turns up in his car to drive us around the surrounding Kinta valley, where there used to be 1,000 tin mines. These are now deep, manmade lakes. Today, virtually none of the mines is still functioning: there is still tin beneath the ground, but extracting it is too expensive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395818424\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/5/1346846227212/Noodle-soup-001.jpg\" alt=\"Noodle soup\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Assam lakha, hot and sour soup, Penang</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The century-old mining town of Papan is certainly no Klondike boom town: most of the shop-houses that line the main street are abandoned or dilapidated. People pass the time playing mah jong or talking tin prices in the Lee Seow Yoon coffee shop. Papan is Hong's special project: he has lovingly recreated the <a href=\"http://www.lestariheritage.net/perak/webpages/papan01.html\" title=\"\">dispensary where Sybil Kathigasu, known as the Malaysian Florence Nightingale</a>, secretly treated guerrilla partisans during the Japanese occupation in the second world war.</p> <p>The war theme continues down the road at Batu Gajah, whose eerie Anglican cemetery is named God's Little Acre. Here stand the graves of three British planters whose violent deaths in 1948 sparked the Malayan Emergency \u2013 12 years of fierce fighting between Chinese communists, British forces and, later, the newly independent Malaysian government. The inscriptions are chilling: \"died at the hands of terrorists\", \"murdered by terrorists\".</p> <p>The mood lightens when Hong unveils his next surprise, a quite amazing ruined castle, straight out of a Somerset Maugham story. I had heard about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kellie%27s_Castle\" title=\"\">Kellie's Castle</a> many years before, but it used to be inaccessible, hidden in the jungle. Now this grandiose folly has become something of a tourist attraction, sitting majestically atop a grassy hillock.</p> <p>William Kellie Smith arrived in Malaya in 1890, aged 20, and after rapidly making a fortune as a planter he decided to build a romantic castle for his wife \u2013 his childhood sweetheart, Agnes. Kellie designed it in ornate Moorish revival style, and planned a rooftop terrace for parties, a basement wine cellar, even a lift to get to the top of the tower. But he died before it was completed. The castle was never inhabited, and after years of abandon it is now overgrown with vegetation and the gnarled roots of towering banyan trees, occupied by monkeys. This being Malaysia, it is apparently also home to numerous ghosts.</p> <p>We finish the day 10 miles south in the town of Tanjung Tualang, whose enterprising inhabitants had the original idea of transforming their mining lakes into farms for freshwater prawns. Every single shophouse here houses a noisy seafood restaurant, drawing busloads of gourmets each weekend. The succulent prawns are enormous, and steamed to perfection in Chinese rice wine, egg white and ginger. This is pricy for Malaysia, though \u2013 a kilo will set diners back \u00a315.</p> <p>Next day we head north from Ipoh, following winding backroads through shady rubber plantations to Kuala Kangsar, which looks at first like a quiet provincial town in a bend on the Perak river. In fact, this is a royal capital, home to the Sultan of Perak, some of the grandest palaces and mosques in Malaysia, and the prestigious Malay College, the nation's answer to Eton.</p> <p>The Sultan, whose predecessors have ruled Perak since the 1500s, lives in a grand pastel art deco palace, the Istana Iskandariah, but visitors can only get a peek from afar. The far more beguiling Istana Kenangan is a magnificent example of Malay architecture \u2013 all wood, but without a single nail. This is open to the public, because it houses the Royal Museum.</p> <p>But nothing compares to the first view of the Ubudiah mosque, a swirling vision of marble turrets and golden cupolas. It was designed in 1917 by Arthur Benison Hubback, an unsung British government architect whose idiosyncratic Indo-Saracen buildings still stand out in most of Malaysia's major towns. Walking round its cool arcades I spot a young Malay couple, resplendent in pale blue wedding robes, posing shyly for photos. Malay hospitality is so generous (and foreign visitors to Kuala Kangsar so rare) that they even invite us to the reception.</p> <p>Before reaching Penang, we plan a break in Malaysia's oldest hill station, one of the cool mountain resorts where you can escape the 30C temperatures and 95% humidity that is the daily climate throughout the year. The road signs may say Bukit Larut, but everyone still uses the colonial name of Maxwell Hill.</p> <p>Most of the hill stations have been modernised, but not Maxwell Hill. The one road up to the 1,250m summit is a rough path with 72 hairpin bends, which only the official government jeep is allowed to tackle. Every hotel development here has ended up closed or abandoned, and although there are a couple of ramshackle bungalows and nature hostels, I have been warned to prepare for minimal facilities.</p> <p>The reward, though, is a solitary paradise for birdwatchers, butterfly enthusiasts and jungle trekkers, with amazing views as far as the Andaman Sea. We are not to be rewarded today, though: usually in Malaysia, everyone's favourite catchword is <em>boleh</em> \u2013 can do \u2013 but at the jeep office, where a \"ticket sold out today\" sign foils our plans, and no amount of persuasion, or bribery, can get us a seat. So we head back to the road, and after a couple of hours are sailing over the eight-mile-long Penang bridge, which links the mainland to the island known as the pearl of the orient.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395818425\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/6/1346950652523/Cheong-Fatt-Tze-Mansion-P-008.jpg\" alt=\"Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion, Penang\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion, Penang</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I must admit I did not really believe all the buzz about Penang, but the moment we arrive at our designer B&amp;B it is obvious that the island's capital, George Town, is no longer the rundown place I remember. Unesco world heritage status (granted in 2008) has saved historic buildings from the wrecking ball and bulldozer. Instead of making way for high-rise office blocks and shopping centres, the sumptuous Chinese mansions and maze-like shop-houses are being elegantly transformed into boutique hotels, art galleries and boutiques, funky restaurants and bars. And down in the street, there are still the teeming markets, artisan workshops, strange medicinal shops and delicious 24-hour hawker stalls that make George Town one of the last surviving authentic Chinatowns.</p> <p>We're staying in Cheong Fatt Tze mansion \u2013 known as the Blue Mansion because of its distinctive painted walls \u2013 which was built in the 1880s by a Chinese entrepreneur dubbed the \"Rockefeller of the East\". I actually wandered in here years ago when the house was falling apart and inhabited by squatters. Now it is a symbol of George Town's transformation, restored to its former glory, guestrooms furnished with antiques from mainland China alongside art nouveau treasures over from Europe. Our room, in the old kitchen, has the original hearth and cooker.</p> <p>For an even better glimpse of Penang's opulent past, there is the nearby Peranakan Museum (<a href=\"http://pinangperanakanmansion.com.my/\" title=\"\">pinangperanakanmansion.com.my</a>), a perfectly preserved private mansion filled with treasures.</p> <p>Wandering through Penang's melting pot of mosques, Hindu temples and incense-filled Chinese shrines, we stumble on Chinahouse (<a href=\"http://chinahouse.com.my/\" title=\"\">chinahouse.com.my</a>), an eclectic cultural centre that exhibits art-house installations, promotes reggae and soul concerts and showcases gourmet Pacific Rim cuisine \u2013 unheard of in the old Penang. Studio Howard (<a href=\"http://studiohoward.com/site/\" title=\"\">studiohoward.com</a>) is a cutting-edge photo gallery, while Campbell House (<a href=\"http://www.campbellhousepenang.com/\" title=\"\">campbellhousepenang.com</a>) is a hip guesthouse with a genuine Venetian restaurant \u2013 it's run by a chef from La Serenissima who has come to Penang to make his name.</p> <p>This is just the tip of the iceberg of the metamorphosis of the pearl of the orient. Responsible heritage tourism could well have the same effect on the rest of Malaysia's heartland.</p>",
  "<p>Insects are biting back. NHS Direct has reported a 20% rise in the number of bites and stings it deals with since 2010, leading to speculation about invasive new species and mutant super-fleas.</p> <p>However, the real reason for the increase probably has more to do with the weather. Fleas, both adults and larvae, thrive in mild, damp conditions. They need a humidity of more than 30% and are killed off by cold snaps, so the wet spring was ideal for them. No wonder that sales of flea control products are up by a quarter this year.</p> <p>It has also been a good year for ticks. A summer day with temperature above 32C can kill ticks; when it's dry, they will dehydrate at lower temperatures and can die in a few days. Without either of these checks, the tick population has soared. The weather has also produced plenty of long grass, where unwitting hosts pick up ticks as they pass.</p> <p>Mosquitoes are doing similarly well. Their eggs and larvae require standing water, and the high rainfall has provided plenty of breeding grounds and a population boom.</p> <p>It's no surprise that Lyme disease, carried by ticks, is on the increase. Malaria used to be common in Britain when it was known as ague. The Chief Medical Officer has warned that warmer, wetter conditions may result in malaria being endemic again by 2050. If that happens those increasing insect bites could change from an annoyance into a real health hazard. </p>",
  "<p>Canada has closed its embassy in Tehran and ordered the expulsion of Iranian diplomats from Ottawa, partly because of the country's backing of the Syrian regime.</p> <p>Canada's foreign affairs minister, John Baird, cited Iran's support for Bashar al-Assad, its disputed nuclear programme and continued human rights violations as reasons behind his country's decision to sever diplomatic ties with Tehran. He said the Canadian government perceived Iran to be \"the most significant threat to global peace and security in the world today\". \"Canada has closed its embassy in Iran, effective immediately, and declared personae non gratae all remaining Iranian diplomats in Canada,\" Baird said.</p> <p>All Canadian diplomatic staff had left Iran and Iranian diplomats in Ottawa had five days to leave the country. Canada joins its main allies, the US and the UK, as countries without diplomatic presence in Tehran.</p> <p>\"The Iranian regime is providing increasing military assistance to the Assad regime; it refuses to comply with UN resolutions pertaining to its nuclear programme; it routinely threatens the existence of Israel and engages in racist anti-Semitic rhetoric and incitement to genocide,\" Baird said in the statement published on Canada's government website for foreign affairs and international trade.</p> <p>Ottawa's move comes only a week after Iran attempted to seize upon an international conference in Tehran to claim a diplomatic triumph in defiance of western-led efforts to isolate the regime. To the dismay of Iran, two of its main guests for Tehran's summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, and Egypt's president, Mohamed Morsi, embarrassed the host by making speeches unwelcome by the regime. Morsi, in particular, stunned Iran, a staunch supporter of Assad, with a plea to the world to back Syrian rebels.</p> <p>Canada is an outspoken critic of Iran's human rights record and has actively pursued the effort to hold Tehran leaders accountable for their right's violations on international platforms in recent years, including through sanctions.</p> <p>Baird said: \"[Iran] is among the world's worst violators of human rights; and it shelters and materially supports terrorist groups, requiring the government of Canada to formally list Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism under the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act. Moreover, the Iranian regime has shown blatant disregard for the Vienna convention and its guarantee of protection for diplomatic personnel. Under the circumstances, Canada can no longer maintain a diplomatic presence in Iran.Our diplomats serve Canada as civilians, and their safety is our number one priority.\"</p> <p>Baird appeared to be referring to an incident last November when protesters in the Iranian capital stormed the British embassy in Tehran, ransacking offices and diplomatic residence.</p> <p>Payam Akhavan, a professor of international law at McGill University in Montreal, said the recent row was the worst crisis in bilateral relations between Tehran and Ottawa for many years.</p> <p>\"I think the closure of Iranian embassy in Ottawa should be seen in the context of concerns by the Canadian government about the Islamic republic's recent activities in its Ottawa mission, including using it to establish wider presence in Canada through a series of ostensibly cultural activities, at universities and other institutes and infiltrating the Iranian diaspora and neutralising opposition to the regime,\" he said.</p> <p>According to latest official figures more than 400,000 Iranians live in Canada. \"There is an significant Iranian diaspora in Canada, we call Toronto, Tehranto, even many regime insiders live here but the majority consists of refugees or migrants,\" said Akhavan.</p> <p>The Canadian embassy in Ankara, Turkey, will provide services to Canadians living in Iran in the absence of Tehran's mission. The Canadian foreign ministry has also upgraded its Iran travel advice, urging all its citizens not to travel to Iran.</p> <p>\"Canadians who have Iranian nationality are warned in particular that the Iranian regime does not recognise the principle of dual nationality,\" it said. \"By doing so, Iran makes it virtually impossible for government of Canada officials to provide consular assistance to Iranian-Canadians in difficulty.\"</p> <p>The frosty relations between the two capitals became even more restrained in 2003 when an Iranian-Canadian photographer, Zahra Kazemi, died while in jail in Iran. Iran said she died of a stroke but Canada insisted she died under torture because of a skull fracture.</p> <p>A number of Iranian-Canadians are currently held behind bars in Iran, including Hamid Ghassemi-Shall who is facing execution after being convicted of espionage, a charge his family say is trumped-up.</p> <p>There was no immediate reaction from Iran in response to Canada's move but Iranian state news agencies reported Baird's statement.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/kim-kardashian\" title=\"\">Kim Kardashian</a> is in a makeup chair under giant&#xa0;rollers, looking down at her phone and intermittently up again, to meet her own eye in the mirror. We are at a studio in a Los Angeles suburb; various stylists and Kardashian hangers-on fill the room. \"One second,\" says the&#xa0;star's assistant, calling the group to order. Kardashian frowns at her phone. \"You guys,\" she says, \"what should I say? You guys?\" There is a moment's hush; Kardashian is passing a tweet.</p> <p>For those few who haven't yet had the pleasure, Kardashian is a 31-year-old US reality TV star, lately prominent in Britain, who has, since becoming famous in 2007, ascended to the level of a symptom in the culture. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086761/\" title=\"\">Keeping Up With The Kardashians</a>, currently in its seventh season, is contrived, sensationalist, repetitive and witless, but no more so than a lot of things one enjoys without accusing them of spiritual corruption. The difference in this case is reach. Twitter is an unreliable measure of influence, but Kardashian has nearly 16 million followers, putting her ninth in the world, three places behind President Obama. (Lady Gaga is number one; Taylor Swift number eight.) With her two sisters, Khlo\u00e9 and Kourtney, she runs a chain of clothing stores called Dash, has a Las Vegas-based outlet called Kardashian Khaos, promotes makeup and fashion lines under the label Kardashian Kollection, all of which act as window dressing for the business, merely, of being Kim Kardashian: a woman of above average looks, seemingly rather nice, who along with the rest of her family \u2013 emotionally speaking \u2013 strips on TV for tips. After the shoot, we sit in a courtyard at the back of the studio and Kardashian tries to explain what the fuss is about.</p> <p>There is an awful lot of fuss. For Kardashian haters, the tipping point came last year when she filed for divorce from Kris Humphries, a basketball player, after three months of marriage and a blizzard of wedding coverage said to have been worth many millions (she will dispute the numbers). The whole thing looked like a stunt to drum up trade for her TV show, although if it was, it backfired in that for a short while she was reviled as the most cynical woman in America. She seems to aggravate male actors in particular. Earlier this year, Jon Hamm unchivalrously referred to her as a \"fucking idiot\" in Elle magazine, as did Daniel Craig in GQ the year before. Kardashian takes all this with a certain laconic indifference, the standard LA response, heightened by what is probably an effort not to emote too much and generate wrinkles.</p> <p>\"When I hear people say [what are you famous for?], I want to say, what are you talking about?\" she says slowly, her eyes wide as a bushbaby's. \"I&#xa0;have a hit TV show. We've shot more episodes than <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043208/\" title=\"\">I Love Lucy</a>! We've been on the air longer than <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053479/\" title=\"\">The Andy Griffith Show</a>! I mean, these are iconic shows, so it blows my mind when people say that.\"</p> <p>But you're not performing; you're just being followed around by cameras\u2026</p> <p>\"But to be able to open up your life like that and to be so\u2026 if everyone could do it, everyone would. It doesn't make sense to me.\"</p> <p>The day before the interview, I go to Dash in Beverly Hills, the flagship store aimed at Kardashian's teen fan base. A bouncer stands outside letting teenagers in one by one, although the store is almost empty. \"There's a line!\" he calls out to baffled passers-by, and the teenagers snigger. Inside, the clothes are very nice; soft T-shirts, cute shorts and dresses, but that isn't why people are here. Kardashian says that since the show started airing, the store has become a \"tourist attraction\" and the stock is angled accordingly. After taking photos of themselves in front of a giant Kardashian family montage, the adolescents buy one of several items within their price-range; a $20 compact mirror; pencils for a few dollars; or a $10 bottle of water with the Kardashian sisters' photo on one side.</p> <p>\"Our water sells out all the time,\" Kardashian says. \"People collect them because each store has&#xa0;a different picture on the bottle.\"</p> <p>That's amazing.</p> <p>\"It's really crazy,\" she says. \"I mean, a water bottle? It's crazy.\" She blinks slowly at the wonder of effortless profiteering.</p> <p>Kardashian characterises her typical fan as \"a&#xa0;younger girl, like 15 or 16, who loves fashion, loves to be a girly girl, loves beauty, glam\", and whom she respects as a backwards projection of herself. If you can overlook the vacant materialism, she is in some ways not a bad role model. She points out that she is not \"your stick-skinny typical model\"; that she doesn't go out on benders; that she tries not to swear too much. \"I remember this one time when I used the F-word \u2013 and everyone was like, I can't believe you said that! You never say that! I am really cautious about what I say and do. If I look at the message I'm portraying, I think it definitely is be who you are, but be your best you.\"</p> <p>Whether or not you approve of the show, she has wrought a successful business out of thin air. It's also worth pointing out, given how snotty the fashion industry is towards Kim Kardashian, that to anyone's knowledge she has never thrown her phone at a personal assistant.</p> <p>And yet she makes people incredibly angry. \"Yeah. I have no idea why. I work really hard \u2013 I have seven appointments tomorrow before 10am. I'm constantly on the go. I have a successful clothing line. A fragrance. I mean, acting and singing aren't the only ways to be talented. It's a skill to get people to really like you for <em>you</em>, instead of a character written for you by somebody else.\"</p> <p>She is currently dating Kanye West, who might have had a hand in the following analogy. \"When rap music first started,\" Kardashian says, \"rappers were not respected and people thought it was just a fad. And people thought reality shows were going to come and go. They have taken over the soap operas. So it's a modern version of a soap opera.\"</p> <p>The difference, of course, is that the Kardashians are purporting to sell something real. For bald cheek, nothing matches a recent scene in the show in which Kardashian balked at attending a family therapy session because, she said, she didn't feel like sharing family secrets \"with a stranger\". Very occasionally, a genuine emotion is caught on camera and stands out in relief to the rest of the show \u2013 most recently during a staged discussion about Khlo\u00e9's paternity; while her mother and sisters mugged centre screen, Khlo\u00e9, to one side, looked fleetingly devastated.</p> <p>Despite all the phoniness, rehearsed dialogue and fake scenarios, however, there is some grain of authenticity to the Kardashians to which fans respond: when I asked teenagers at Dash why they liked the show, the most common reason was that, despite all the drama, \"they all really love each other and are such a close family\". Like&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306370/\" title=\"\">the Osbournes</a> before them, the Kardashian family unit is convincingly tight. There is something unexpectedly soothing about this.</p> <p>For the record then, what is Kardashian's talent?</p> <p>\"What is my talent?\" She cocks her head to one side. \"Well, a bear can juggle and stand on a ball and he's talented, but he's not famous. Do you know what I mean?\"</p> <p>The mastermind behind the Kardashian empire is assumed to be Kris Jenner, mother, manager and ringmaster of her children's careers, who comes across on the show as a gimlet-eyed monster, wringing every last dollar from the family conceit. Despite her 100% belief in the reality genre, Kim Kardashian has to admit she is very glad she went through adolescence off-camera, unlike her youngest sisters, who were nine and 10 when the&#xa0;show started. (Their father is Bruce Jenner, the former Olympic athlete and Kris's second husband, whose career as a motivational speaker she reignited after marrying him. Her first husband, Robert Kardashian, who died in 2003, was OJ Simpson's lawyer.)</p> <p>\"I feel a little bit sad for my little sisters,\" Kardashian says. \"If there's one thing I'm so thankful I have, it's that privacy of pretty much my whole life until seven years ago.\"</p> <p>It was a spoilt childhood, materially \u2013 her father was a wealthy entrepreneur as well as a lawyer \u2013 and it's a mark of the milieu they grew up in that the Kardashian girls and their brother, Rob, were considered deprived because their parents wouldn't give them their own credit cards.</p> <p>But her dad bought them each a car, right?</p> <p>\"He gave us a car, but I had to sign a contract with him before I got it.\"</p> <p>The contract said she had to have it washed once a week; had to make sure it always had gas. \"And my grades had to be at a certain average to keep the car. If I crashed it, I had to be responsible for paying for it.\" She did crash it, within the first six months, and got a job to pay for the repairs.</p> <p>This was the beginning of Kardashian's career. She found work in a clothing store and liked it so much that, after paying off the car, she kept the job. She started to design her own accessories. \"I&#xa0;would make these headbands that were really popular and I'd sell them to all the fun stores in LA. I would make them after school and go around selling them.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396091175\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/4/1346773298176/Kanye-West-and-Kim-Kardas-008.jpg\" alt=\"Kanye West and Kim Kardashian\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kanye West and Kim Kardashian Photograph: Billy Farrell Agency/Rex Features</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Billy Farrell Agency/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She and her sisters periodically lived with their father at this point, their parents' marriage having disintegrated after Kris Jenner had an affair with a&#xa0;22-year-old. Fault lines in the family were, bizarrely, crystallised by the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/simpson\" title=\"\">OJ Simpson</a> trial. Kardashian's mother had been one of Nicole Brown Simpson's best friends and was supposed to have seen her on the day she was murdered; she believed OJ was guilty. Robert Kardashian was one of OJ's best friends and defended him.</p> <p>\"We were kids \u2013 14 and 15 years old, me and Kourtney,\" Kim says. \"We took my dad's side. Just because my dad was not married and my mum kind of broke his heart. It was personal. And&#xa0;we thought that my dad was the smartest man in the whole world. And if he thought he was &#xa0;innocent, we were going to be on that side.\"</p> <p>One day, their father came to them and said, \"Girls, this is a huge trial and is going to be a part&#xa0;of history, and I think you guys are old enough to handle it.\" They went into court with him and sat in the OJ camp. \"And my mum had gone with Bruce and she was sitting on the Brown&#xa0;side \u2013 on Nicole's side. And she turned around and gave as a <em>stare</em> like, I don't even want&#xa0;to see you guys when you get home. We wouldn't even look her way. She was so mad.\"</p> <p>This was the beginning of the family's life in the spotlight, although Kardashian had always wanted to be on TV. She watched the first MTV reality show, <a href=\"http://www.mtv.co.uk/shows/the-real-world\" title=\"\">The Real World</a>, and thought that's what she wanted to do.</p> <p>What, be on a reality show? \"Yes. I wasn't thinking fame. I was just thinking how cool.\" Why? \"I don't know; I just thought my life seemed interesting. I thought, if only people knew the crazy things that go on in this household, it would be so funny. And everyone kept saying that. They'd come over and be like, 'Oh my God, you need your own reality show.' I was always on board. Kourtney was the one who wasn't.\"</p> <p>Kim inched farther towards her goal when she started knocking around with Paris Hilton, and then, in 2003, she made a sex tape with her then boyfriend, the singer Ray J. The tape was eventually leaked and a star was born. (In a rare moment of coyness, Kris Jenner, in her memoir, glosses over this momentous turning point in the family history: \"There was so much media coverage swirling around Kim then, both positive and negative.\") Anyway, to \"take advantage of the moment\", Jenner made a pilot of the family and took it to Ryan Seacrest at US TV network E! Word came back that there were too many characters, too many siblings and that it was confusing. But Seacrest ultimately backed the show, correctly intuiting that, as with band members, young fans would be able to choose which of the three sisters was their favourite: blank but beautiful Kim, sweet Kourtney or sarcastic Khlo\u00e9. Meanwhile, Jenner's conniving entertained adults and, for comic relief, there was&#xa0;Bruce, bobbing around in the background, looking more startled with each season and new wave of plastic surgery.</p> <p>It's no small thing to keep a reality show afloat, and even Kardashian admits that by season four the family was getting panicky about content. \"I&#xa0;was like, 'You guys, I don't know that I have much more to give. I can only be myself, like\u2026 we're so boring now, we've shown everything.'\"</p> <p>And? \"And then Khlo\u00e9 got married, Kourtney got pregnant and everything else just happened&#xa0;organically.\"</p> <p>OK. So here's the thing: surely, living under that kind of pressure to feed the beast, one is tempted to say yes to things one might otherwise say no to, for example marrying Kris Humphries and then divorcing Kris Humphries. It doesn't even have to be mercenary; just a matter of needing to Make Something \u2013 Anything \u2013 Happen.</p> <p>\"Not really. We had done filming our season at that point, so we decided to film for the wedding. And that was a decision that he and I made together. But I think that, with any decisions in life [brace yourselves], like, I spoke to a girl today who had cancer and we were talking about how this is such a hard thing for her, but it taught her a big lesson on who her friends are and so much about life. She's 18. And I was like, that's how I feel.\"</p> <p>There is no ethical dimension to Kardashian's defence of her marriage, merely the rationale that it would have made bad commercial sense to have faked it. \"Getting married and divorced quickly, if that was my goal the whole time \u2013 I'm not an idiot, I obviously know that that would be a bad business decision. If anything, I probably would have left sooner had I not been filming, because I didn't want to end the relationship on TV.\" The sums of money she was said to have made are \"completely outrageous and not true\", she says. \"No, I mean even with the money we&#xa0;made, we still had to pay for the wedding. We &#xa0;didn't even make enough for that.\"</p> <p>So if you married again, would you sell the rights? \"I would definitely do it differently. Just all the scrutiny that I got. You don't plan to go through all of that willingly. For money.\" Her voice rises out of its Californian drawl and sounds&#xa0;momentarily urgent. \"That's just not what a sane person would do. So. Would I get married on TV again? No.\"</p> <p>She thinks about it for a moment. \"Well, I guess you never say never. Because who knows? So many other people I know have gotten married on TV and it has worked out amazing for them.\"</p> <p>There is a pause. \"William and Kate got married on TV,\" Kardashian says thoughtfully.</p> <p>Not all the endorsement deals have been successful. There was a debit card (\"the Kardashian Kard\") that had high hidden fees and from which, after a&#xa0;firestorm in the press, the family distanced themselves; and a diet product that is currently the subject of a lawsuit. Of the card, Kardashian says, \"definitely not the right deal for us. It sounded like a good idea when we went into it, but there were all these hidden fees and costs that even we didn't know about. Although, if you looked at it, it was still a lower percentage than the bank gives you on a credit card.\"</p> <p>(It's true that $10 a month fees for prepaid debit cards are not unusual, although there were other fees attached \u2013 $1.50 to ring the service centre for&#xa0;example \u2013 which looked, given the age of the target market, a little ungenerous.) In Kardashian world, attracting bad PR is a moral failing. \"For us, we just didn't want that negative press, so we backed off.\" As for QuickTrim, the diet product, \"If you look at every diet product, there's tons of lawsuits. So that is a successful product, actually.\"</p> <p>Kardashian has probably attracted more criticism for her decision to pose topless in Playboy and W magazines, something she hesitated over, but her mother talked her into. Good old Kris. Her&#xa0;father would have been horrified, Kardashian says. \"He would have killed me.\"</p> <p>But her mum? \"Oh, she was all for it.\"</p> <p>Doesn't she think it undermines her credibility as a business person? \"No, sex is powerful and I&#xa0;think it's empowering, so I don't. I would have thought that before, but now I don't. I go back and forth about it.\"</p> <p>The point is that men in her position would not&#xa0;be asked to pose naked. \"Yeah!\" she says with&#xa0;wonder, as if we have hit upon yet another feminist advantage in the world. \"I think it's empowering and I'll do what I want!\"</p> <p>She has at least been consistent in this. In her early 20s, long before the show, Kardashian was&#xa0;married to a musician called Damon Thomas,&#xa0;a fact she shared with her family only after the event. When I ask why she didn't tell her&#xa0;mother she was getting married, she has what looks like a rare, unstudied reaction. With a shuttered look, Kardashian says, \"Just a bad choice on my part.\"</p> <p>For months after the second marriage debacle, Kardashian says she stopped Googling herself, as near to a breakdown a member of that family can get. She changed her email address. She lost friends. \"All these people who were so on my side completely turned on me, and they're now trying to come back and be friends.\"</p> <p>Her pairing with Kanye West is odd; he so outspoken and political, Kardashian so neutral on&#xa0;almost everything. The first time she voted in her life was for Obama. \"I loved being part of that decision-making process, but I never voted in prior years when I was legally eligible. I don't know why.\" She is, she says, a \"liberal Republican\", put off Mitt Romney because of his stance against gay marriage. This election, she says, \"I don't know which way I'm going to go.\" Her favourite politician of all time is Kennedy.</p> <p>Kanye will appear intermittently in the next season of the show. They are taking their relationship \"season by season\". \"It's what we're both comfortable with, and it's all about making a&#xa0;group decision. Him and I, as a team.\"</p> <p>I imagine Kris Jenner might be in that decision, too. Won't the day come, I ask, when Kardashian rises up and overthrows her mother? She actually breaks out an annoyed facial expression. \"We are totally equal. She listens to what I say. She follows my lead. She works for me. I mean, on the&#xa0;show maybe it doesn't come off that way\u2026\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, another generation of Kardashians is emerging to fill the endless hours of scheduling. Kourtney's child Mason, a toddler, now takes up a good part of many episodes. Khlo\u00e9 and her husband Lamar have their own show, Khlo\u00e9 &amp; Lamar. The other day, Lamar went to the dentist. If Kardashian had a baby, she says, she would probably put it on&#xa0;TV, with certain caveats. For example, with Mason, \"he can come in and say, hi/bye, and that's it\", but isn't allowed to drive story lines.</p> <p>The point is, she has more perspective these days. The marriage crisis changed her. \"I'm leaning more towards being a little more private.\"</p> <p>So she might potentially say no to another season? Kardashian blinks. \"I never said I wouldn't do the family show.\" But it's very possible, she says, that the universe has shifted enough for her&#xa0;to say words she couldn't have imagined herself saying a year ago, an extraordinary break with Kardashian family values: \"I'll never do a&#xa0;spin-off.\"</p>",
  "<p>As a result of a wave of challenges to the 1965 Voting Rights Act, that seminal American law faces a likely review by the supreme court, whose conservative Republican majority is the most rightward-leaning in modern history. If the Voting Rights Act is toppled, other civil rights laws \u2013 including the 1964 Civil Rights Act \u2013 are in danger as well.</p> <p>Faced with recalcitrant state officials who prohibited blacks from voting, and federal laws that proved inadequate in stopping them, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act. Its purpose was to outlaw the discriminatory voting schemes that disenfranchised African Americans in the south and elsewhere. For example, section 2 of the legislation banned the use of literacy tests as a voting requirement. Meanwhile, section 5 required certain jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination to obtain federal approval for changes to its voting laws. The section applies to nine states and sections of seven other states. The act also allows the attorney general to challenge the use of poll taxes.</p> <p>Passage of the legislation was expedited by acts of racial violence in the south, including the murder of three civil rights workers in Philadelphia, Mississippi in 1964, and the brutal 1965 police attack on peaceful protesters marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on their journey from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama.</p> <p>Although the Voting Rights Act was passed by a Democratic-controlled Congress and signed by a Democratic president, most opposition came from southern Democratic lawmakers who had an interest in maintaining Jim Crow segregation and suppressing the political aspirations of African Americans. A larger majority of Republican lawmakers supported the act, as their party had supported \"full implementation and faithful execution\" of all civil rights statutes in its 1964 platform. After all, the \"Grand Old Party\" was once the party of the Radical Republicans, who had ushered in the civil rights amendments abolishing slavery, granting citizenship to blacks and allowing for black suffrage. In the post-civil war reconstruction era, the Republicans boasted some 2,000 black elected officials nationwide.</p> <p>In the late 1960s, however, the Republicans began employing a \"southern strategy\" to capitalize on white resentment of civil rights. A color-coded politics, perfected by the late GOP operative Lee Atwater, allowed taxes, big government and welfare to become proxies for the N-word. This led to the realignment of Dixie, with the Republican party controlling the former confederate states, and blacks eventually shifting their allegiance nearly exclusively to the Democrats.</p> <p>Moderate whites fled the party, as well. The more recent Tea Party takeover of the GOP \u2013 with the attendant hatred of a black president, Latino immigrants, civil rights and multicultural diversity \u2013 represents a natural consequence of that strategy. And the exclusively rightwing Republican fixation with voter fraud and voter ID reflects this new reality.</p> <p>Across the nation, 33 states have proposed laws restricting voting, including a requirement that citizens present a government-issued photo ID in order to vote. Spurred by conservative Republican legislators and their American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), these laws are promoted under the pretext of combating voter fraud. Yet, voter fraud is exceedingly rare, with a 1 in 2.3m chance of occurring in a federal election, according to the NAACP. In a lawsuit challenging Pennsylvania's draconian voter ID law, lawyers representing the Republican-controlled commonwealth conceded there is no evidence voter fraud exists.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Mike Turzai, the Republican leader in the state House of Representatives, has proclaimed that voting restrictions will enable a Republican victory in the upcoming presidential election. \"Voter ID, which is gonna allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania, done,\" he said. The states that have enacted such laws account for 78% of the electoral votes needed to elect the president, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.</p> <p>In Texas, where the state's discriminatory voter ID law was recently overturned by a federal appeals court, the state Republican party platform calls for a repeal of the Voting Rights Act. Supporters of repeal claim section 5 of the Act places an undue burden on some states and not others. And yet, the scourge of racially-motivated voter disenfranchisement legislation throughout the country, a potent example of Republican hubris and overreach, provides ample proof that the act is needed now more than ever.</p> <p>America is on the path to becoming a nation whose majority consists of people of color. The ongoing attack on civil rights, funded by the Koch Brothers and others, reflects a refusal by white conservatives to accept this new reality. Latinos are the fastest growing demographic group in the south, and African Americans are participating in a reverse migration to that region of the country. </p> <p>Given these circumstances, it is inevitable that red southern states will turn to blue, as Obama won North Carolina and Virginia in 2008. But amidst this demographic shift, the GOP is a nearly exclusively white party, with whites accounting for over 90% of the delegates at this year's convention in Tampa. The recent assault on a black CNN camerawoman by GOP convention attendees, and a recent poll showing zero percent black support for Mitt Romney, highlight the party's problem.</p> <p>The Jim Crow segregation laws denied black people their voting rights, told them who they could not marry and where they could not eat, sit or use the bathroom. This legal regime criminalized and dehumanized an entire group of people by promulgating laws that only applied to them, with penalties including imprisonment and death. These were what Martin Luther King Jr called unjust laws \u2013 \"a code that a numerical or power majority group compels a minority group to obey, but does not make binding on itself. This is difference made legal.\" The civil rights movement was an effort to eradicate unjust laws. And now, the Republican party is blatant in its efforts to undue the work of that movement by enacting unjust laws with a different name, but an identical purpose.</p> <p>In its 2012 platform, the Republican party endorses the voter ID laws, stating: \"Voter fraud is political poison. It strikes at the heart of representative government.\" But the real poison is the politically-inspired, extremist assault on civil rights in the US. And the real poisoners are those Republican lawmakers leading the charge.</p>",
  "<p>Did you think that it was only in Victorian England that debtors were forced into the workhouse? Think again. This week a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/04/eurozone-six-day-week-greece\" title=\"\">leaked letter</a> revealed that Greece's eurozone creditors are demanding a six-day week as a condition of the latest bailout.</p> <p>Of all the far-out ideas for solving the Greek crisis, this one surely takes the biscuit. First, it is completely unenforceable. Second, those Greeks&#xa0;in full-time employment already work the longest hours in the European Union. Finally, how does the troika (the EU, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank) propose to provide work for the 25% of Greeks unemployed? And yet, as preposterous as the&#xa0;demand may sound, it needs to be taken seriously \u2013 not least as a symptom of a growing belief that Europeans have to work longer and harder to recover prosperity.</p> <p>The reduction of the working week was one of the great achievements of 20th-century social democracy. A labourer in mid-Victorian Britain could expect to work 60 hours a week \u2013 10 hours a day, six days a week \u2013 from adolescence till death. Sundays alone were left free for chapel or gin. The early trade union movement campaigned vigorously against this regime with the slogan \"Eight hours labour, eight hours recreation, eight hours rest\". Its efforts bore fruit. By 1930, weekly hours in Britain had sunk to 47; by 1980, they were down to 40. Sociologists talked of the coming \"end of work\" and wondered with vague apprehension how the vacant hours would be occupied.</p> <p>Then something strange happened. Some time around 1980, working hours in most western nations stopped falling. In Britain and the US, they actually started rising again, especially among the rich. This new trend coincided, not accidentally, with the deregulation of markets, the smashing of union power and the growth of income inequality. The world reverted to the earlier, more brutal form of capitalism characterised by John Stuart Mill as \"trampling, crushing, elbowing, and treading on each other's heels\".</p> <p>The free-market right looks favourably upon the revival of work. Indeed, some say it has not gone far enough. \"The British are among the worst idlers in the world,\" claims Britannia Unchained, a recent polemic by five young Tory radicals. \"We work among the lowest hours, we retire early and our productivity is poor.\" The authors conclude with a paean to \"the lost virtue of&#xa0;hard graft\", now exemplified by the Asian tigers.</p> <p>The pro-work brigade offer us two arguments. The first is economic: we need to work harder in order to keep pace with the industrious Asians and support our growing population of retirees. The second is psychological: work is enjoyable, or at any rate good for us. If we worked only 20 hours a week, American judge Richard Posner argued recently (<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/books/review/how-much-is-enough-by-robert-skidelsky-and-edward-skidelsky.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">in a review of our book</a>), we would \"brawl, steal, overeat, drink and sleep late.\" Slackers need the discipline of work to stay on the straight and narrow. &#xa0;</p> <p>Neither argument is convincing. The first ignores the fact that prosperity is connected to productivity, not hours of&#xa0;work. The Germans have the most successful economy in Europe&#xa0;despite working shorter hours than the hapless Greeks. Hardly any production was lost in the two months when Edward Heath put Britain on a three-day week in 1974. Many British office workers fill out their long hours with important-sounding but factitious activity: video-conferencing, PowerPoint presentations, \"brain-storming\" sessions. Remember Parkinson's law: work always expands to fill the time available. &#xa0;</p> <p>The second argument is a counsel of despair. It pictures us as so incapable of&#xa0;making creative use of our time that we need others to organise it for us. Insofar as this is true, it is an indictment of our civilisation. \"There was formerly a capacity for light-heartedness and play&#xa0;which has been to some extent inhibited by the cult of efficiency,\" wrote Bertrand Russell in his 1932 essay, In Praise of Idleness.</p> <p>We have lost the arts of leisure, and so&#xa0;face a stark choice of work or dissipation. Our predicament is that of the world-weary French poet Baudelaire, who wrote: \"One must work, if not from taste, then at least from despair. For to reduce everything to a single truth, work is less boring than pleasure.\"</p> <p>In 1929 the economist John Maynard Keynes looked forward to a world without work, in which \"we shall once more value ends above means and prefer the good to the useful\". Yet all we can offer our children is&#xa0;insecurity and hard graft. Keynes found his social ideal in the writings of poets and philosophers. How ironic that&#xa0;already wealthy western societies&#xa0;find theirs in the sweatshops of China and the workhouses of Victorian England.</p>",
  "<p>A man was charged on Friday in connection with an explosives scare that ended with a Texas-bound US Airways jet being recalled to Philadelphia.</p> <p>An unwitting passenger, Christopher Shell, was escorted off the plane at gunpoint when the plane landed, after a call from Kenneth W Smith allegedly reported Shell to be carrying carrying a liquid explosive. Shell had been involved in a feud involving his ex-girlfriend and Smith, her new boyfriend.</p> <p>Smith admitted making the call from a payphone to \"avenge\" his girlfriend because Shell had posted a compromising picture of her on Facebook, authorities said.</p> <p>But while Shell was cleared of involvement in the mid-air scare, he was later arrested in Texas on outstanding drugs charges.</p> <p>Officials recalled US Airways flight 1267, which was about 90 miles away from Philadelphia. When it landed, the plane was surrounded by law enforcement and Shell was taken off at gunpoint. Authorities later said he did nothing wrong.</p> <p>Shell gave officers the name of Smith's workplace, where he was questioned.</p> <p>During questioning, Shell told authorities of a feud involving him, his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend.

He continued his travel late Thursday to Texas, where he planned to celebrate his 29th birthday with friends and family, but authorities arrested him when he arrived at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.</p> <p>Texas authorities said Shell had outstanding warrants for two drug-possession charges \u2013 less than 2oz of marijuana and less than 28g of a controlled substance.</p> <p>He was jailed Friday morning on $3,000 bond in Collin County near Dallas.</p>",
  "<p>This sun-starved summer has left a harvest of shrunken fruit in the hedgerows of a country lane. Tight little green blackberries without even a blush of promise outnumber the purples on every bramble bush by 10&#xa0;to one. If last year's blackberry crop was bad, this year's is far worse. Wasps raise no buzz of protest, for there are none \u2013 I counted just three in August. This lush season has not wilted, but it is leaving a legacy of absence.</p> <p>No creature complains more loudly than a jay. I hear a gang in a screeching protest, their voices moving through the canopy of the oak wood beside the lane. Their calls have seemed more frequent and insistent over the last fortnight, but this year the jays do not shriek wolf. Naturalists all over the county have reported a complete failure of the oak crop and a search around my local trees bears this out. Some trees have produced no acorns at all, some have a handful of nuts that appear to have died in their cups, the domed shells sunk at the bottom.</p> <p>But many oaks have been usurped, pierced in the bud by the needle ovipositors of knopper gall wasps. The eggs that hatched triggered the oaks to produce gross distortions instead of acorns. These mutant growths are ripe now, looking like giant walnuts, painted smooth and sickly green. The larvae will drill their way out as winged adults soon and seek turkey oaks to raise next year's generation of wasps. Their abandoned brown nursery husks will lie untouched to rot on the woodland floor.</p> <p>I check tree after blighted tree until I come across a single twig on a single oak bearing two full and healthy acorns, swollen with nutty bounty. Textbooks describe a jay's capacity to pluck and bury 3,000 to 5,000 acorns each autumn. These birds will need all their omnivorous resourcefulness to last through the winter to come.</p>",
  "<p>The brother of an Iraqi-born Briton who was murdered along with three other people in the French Alps has denied that he was in dispute with the dead man over financial matters, investigators in France have said.</p> <p>French prosecutor Eric Maillaud said that police had been told earlier of a possible feud over money involving Saad al-Hilli, the victim, and his brother but that the sibling had gone to a police station in the UK to deny that this was the case.</p> <p>He said that the brother, Zaid al-Hilli, first spoke to police in Britain on Thursday after learning of the massacre from media reports.</p> <p>\"He turned up again this morning because he heard about the conflict, the dispute between himself and his brother and he said, 'no, I don't have a conflict with my brother',\" Maillaud added.</p> <p>Hilli, died from a bullet to the head along with his wife, his 77-year-old mother-in-law and a French cyclist, all gunned down on the edge of a secluded Alpine forest near Lake Annecy and the Swiss border.</p> <p>The murder bears the hallmarks of a professional assassination, according to French investigators, who have sent four officers to Britain to find out more about victim Hilli's life.</p> <p>The French team, which landed in London on Friday evening, will work with British investigators and plan to search Hilli's house in Claygate, south-west London.</p> <p>Maillaud also revealed that Hilli's four-year-old daughter Zeena, who survived by hiding under her mother, had spoken to police about the attack, describing what the prosecutor said was the \"fury\" and \"terror\" of a massacre during which 25 bullets were fired at the victims.</p> <p>\"She explained that from the beginning of the murder she was already between her mother and that other woman and she rushed under her mother's legs, her mother's skirt,\" he added.</p> <p>The little girl and her seven-year-old sister Zainab, who remains in a medically induced coma after being shot and beaten, are apparently the only witnesses to the shootings and are now under police protection.</p> <p>Maillaud also said the family had visited France a number of times before and it was not the first time they had been to Le Solitaire du Lac campsite in Saint-Jorioz, which was where they were staying when they died.</p> <p>Investigators, who say the murders bear the hallmarks of a professional assassination, had said earlier that one line of enquiry was based on suggestions that there had been a money dispute in the family.</p>",
  "<p>French police have said the brutal murder of three members of a British family holidaying in the French Alps, together with the shooting and near-fatal beating of their seven-year-old child, bears all the hallmarks of an organised assassination.</p> <p>The way in which Iraqi-born Saad al-Hilli, 50, his wife, Ikbal, and a 77-year-old woman as well as a passing cyclist were gunned down with a bullet to the head on an isolated hillside near Lake Annecy suggests a premeditated ambush. Investigators admit this scenario is a possibility but say it is only one of several theories being examined.</p> <p>\"All we know for sure is that whoever did this wanted to kill these people,\" the local public prosector, Eric Maillaud, said on Friday. \"It is clear from the fact they put a bullet in each head and shot and beat the girl, presumably leaving her for dead.\"</p> <p>The French investigating authorities have described the way in which the killing happened as a \"strange modus operandi\", which appears to mean that it is not obvious why the attack happened.</p> <p>While it is clear they know much more than they are letting on \u2013 and Lieutenant Colonel Beno\u00eet Vinnemann, the gendarme leading the inquiry, has admitted this, saying vital information should not be made public \u2013 it is also clear that much of what happened on Wednesday remains a mystery. Investigators may know where it happened and when, but the why, how and who have yet to be discovered.</p> <p>\"What can we say for sure? That there was a minimum of three bullets in each body, one to each head; that the gunman was outside the vehicle and the dead \u2014 apart from the cyclist \u2014 were inside. We cannot say if there was one or more killer or one or more arm,\" Maillaud said on Friday.</p> <p>\"We don't know in what order the people died and I fear we may never know.\"</p> <p>There are currently four theories with some credibility: that it was a racist killing, a robbery, the consequence of a family dispute, or that there was a national security connection.</p> <p><strong>Robbery </strong></p> <p>Earlier this year the Foreign Office warned tourists about an emerging \"pattern of incidents\" in this part of France, after gangs appeared to be targeting foreign-registered cars on highways.</p> <p>On Thursday the Evening Standard reported that there had been a series of hold-ups involving masked attackers 50 miles away. The gang tried to steal a Ford Fiesta and a Peugeot and police were investigating whether there was a link between the incidents.</p> <p>Edmund King, president of the AA, said: \"There have been incidents in the south of France and around Lyon. They look for UK-registered cars, then they flash their lights and perhaps point at the car's wheels. The tourists stop their car and while one gang member distracts them, another steals from their car. French police have been cracking down on these gangs but there have been isolated and organised incidents from particular gangs in particular areas.\"</p> <p><strong>National security </strong></p> <p>This theory was triggered in part by a Daily Mail report claiming Hilli had been placed under Special Branch surveillance in 2003 during the Iraq war. Philip Murphy, a neighbour of Hilli in Claygate, Surrey, was quoted by the paper as saying he thought Special Branch used his driveway during the war to monitor Hilli's house.</p> <p>\"I watched them [the officers] from the window and they were watching Mr al-Hilli and his brother,\" Murphy told the Mail. \"I thought they were from special branch. They would sit there all day in their parked car just looking at the house. When Mr al-Hilli came out and drove off, they would follow him. It was all very odd. I never told the family they were being watched.\"</p> <p>However, Whitehall sources told the Guardian there was no sign of a UK intelligence service interest in Hilli: \"He wasn't on their radar.\" There have also been a number of theories based around Hilli's Iraqi ethnicity and his work, which have led some to speculate whether the killing was the work of an intelligence agency, or linked with one.</p> <p>It has been established that Hilli worked in computer-assisted design for the firm Surrey Satellites, which is owned by the large defence and engineering contractor EADS. On Thursday a family friend and fellow engineer, James Matthews, said Hilli was a freelancer and that the last major project he had worked on was designing the galley kitchen of the new Airbus.</p> <p>The picture painted of Hilli so far by friends and neighbours is of a hard-working family man with a love of caravanning who was a respected member of the suburban Surrey community he made his home \u2013 less James Bond, more Terry Scott.</p> <p><strong>Family feud </strong></p> <p>French police confirmed that they were working with their British counterparts on the theory of a family feud. It seems extraordinary that a family dispute could erupt in such a fashion \u2013 with the deaths of so many family members and witnesses in a foreign country.</p> <p>There might have been a paid assassin involved. However, few currently available details back up this theory.</p> <p>A neighbour of the Hillis, Jack Saltman, said he had reported a family-related problem to the police but gave few details as to what it might be. The Mirror carried the story and reported Saltman as saying Hilli mentioned \"two or three times\" over the past two months something which gave him \"cause for concern\".</p> <p>He told the Mirror: \"He had family in Iraq and I know he was worried about their safety and spoke to them on the phone. He told me something about a problem he had and before he left he came round and saw me and asked if I would keep an eye on his house.\"</p> <p>The Mirror's story also reported the existence of a family dispute over an inheritance \"worth more than \u20ac1.2m\". Zaid Alabdi, described as a family friend, said: \"He [Saad al-Hilli] told me he had employed lawyers and was involved in a dispute over a lot of money.\"</p> <p>The Daily Mail spoke to Hilli's accountant, Julian Stedman, who described his accounts as \"straight up\".</p> <p><strong>Racist killing </strong></p> <p>The theory of a lone killer driven by psychopathic, religious or racial hatred is, perhaps, one of France's worst fears.</p> <p>If true, it would take the country back to the dark days earlier this year when Mohamed Merah, who claimed links to Islamist extremism, went on three separate killing sprees in and around the south-western city of Toulouse. Merah, 23, gunned down seven people, including two young children, a rabbi and two French paratroopers, at point-blank range before police eventually shot him dead at his Toulouse flat on 22 March after a 32-hour siege.</p> <p>Although France's intelligence service had French-Algerian Merah on its radar, he was believed to have acted alone. Before he was shot dead he told police he had killed the servicemen in retaliation for the French army's involvement in Afghanistan, and killed the Jewish victims to support Palestinian Muslims.</p>",
  "<p>It is the BBC's most expensive development: the \u00a31bn double-atrium newsroom, tucked away behind All Souls church at the north end of Regent Street in London, which by next March will house 6,000 staff over 11 floors.</p> <p>The 93,000 square metre development may be just over four years late, and \u00a355m over budget after a falling out with its original architect \u2013 but the replacement for the familiar Television Centre is finally coming on air.</p> <p>Last Sunday, the New Broadcasting House, behind the famous art deco headquarters used by Lord Reith, broadcast its first network programme \u2013 The Andrew Marr Show \u2013 with a string of national TV and radio shows due to move between now and Christmas.</p> <p>Newsnight will follow Marr into the basement in October, with Jeremy Paxman already visiting for rehearsals. The programmes will share one of five studios below ground level, carefully constructed with internal and external brickwork separated by a layer of air to reduce noise and movement from outside.</p> <p>Today and other Radio 4 news programmes are due to arrive by the end of the year, on the third floor, a level below the office reserved for incoming director general George Entwistle, whose predecessor but one had to resign after a row about the contents of the early morning radio programme.</p> <p>Meanwhile Huw Edwards and the One, Six, and Ten O'Clock news bulletins are due to arrive in the first three months of next year, although a camera is already perched on a miniature railway which will sweep from the news studio to the weather centre yards away.</p> <p>One of the studios is a so-called \"virtual reality\" set, in effect little more than a green background, chairs and a table, on to which logos, graphics and images can be superimposed. It is the first time BBC News has used such a set, which it hopes will create the illusion of greater visual variety for viewers.</p> <p>Andy Griffee, the BBC's project leader for the past three and a half years, says that the goal was to bring as much of the BBC as possible \"under one roof\" in the building, eventually finished by architects Sheppard Robson. Such is the bureaucracy of the BBC that Griffee says it is possible to save \u00a35m a year in technical support just by bringing so many employees together.</p> <p>But while it has proved possible to squeeze Radio 1 into the best location, the uppermost eighth floor, some London parts of the corporation are left out.</p> <p>Radio 2 will remain in its current building just up the road, and the television commissioners behind the likes of Strictly Come Dancing are stuck in White City \u2013 but most of the rest has been crammed in, including World Service staff, who moved over from the warren of Bush House in the summer.</p> <p>Some of the building has been designed to maximise collaboration and casual encounters between staff, including \"helical staircases\" \u2013 without a central pole \u2013 which run into the newsroom and are intended to be an alternative to the isolation of the 15 lifts that collectively run for half a mile.</p> <p>But a third set of architects, HOK, was brought in to complete the fit-out of the building \u2013 and found it necessary to ensure there were private areas where people could take \"contentious phone calls\" and hold team meetings, according to an associate at that firm, Dan Herriott.</p> <p>Once the site is up and running, the public will be allowed to use the BBC cafe on Portland Place, which has a view of the main open-plan newsroom one level below ground. Although the building's designers remain coy about details, they insist that it will not be possible for protesters or even terrorists to break through the glass that separates the newsroom from the cafe above.</p> <p>Architects said that one of the most complex features of the New Broadcasting House project was contending with the rattle of the underground lines below \u2013 Lucy Homer from Sheppard Robson said the building sat on \"blocks of stainless steel industrial springs\" to dampen the vibration from the Bakerloo and Victoria lines.</p> <p>Even so, to fit everything in, Homer said that part of the building encroached slightly on the 6 metre \"exclusion zone\" above any London Underground line. Tests had to be conducted with London Underground to ensure that the foundations, which came no more than 1 metre into the exclusion zone, had no impact on the Victoria Line northbound.</p> <p>Sheppard Robson was brought in halfway through the project to replace Sir Richard MacCormac \u2013 forced off the project in 2005 after a row over design and cost \u2013 amid complaints that he had been treated with \"insufferable contempt\" by outgoing director general Mark Thompson. The curved glass \"cyclorama\" on the outside of the building, which wraps around John Nash's Grade 1 listed All Souls church, is from the original design, which includes glass shaded to match the grey Portland stone of the original 1930s building.</p> <p>However, plans for a complex fluted columns rising up from the newsroom were dropped in favour of a more functional design aimed at fitting more staff in. Homer said that the old design was somewhat darker and that by having two atriums between the office floors above, \"daylight was much improved\" in a way that would ensure the BBC has a happy experience of the site.</p> <p>Nevertheless, while it will be easier to bring high profile guests to central London as compared to White City, other benefits of the \u00a31bn spend are more subtle. Barney Jones, the editor of Andrew Marr's programme, says that one advantage of the new studio is that the gesticulating journalist can now always introduce his Sunday morning programme whilst walking in, whereas previously smaller quarters in West London meant there was a risk of him tripping over parts of the set prepared for the musicians who round off his programme.</p>",
  "<p>When you move through those wide-open spaces, the American Dream becomes an awe-inspiring reality. Driving with my family for three weeks this summer through the deserts of California, Nevada, Arizona and Utah, through canyons floored with sage-brush, joshua trees, sometimes only rocks and dust, I finally got it. I fell hopelessly in love with the US.</p> <p>It's the implacable power of the landscape to resist the imprecations of humanity that does it. The emptiness of&#xa0;the west, hundreds of miles after hundreds of miles, looms in testament to the sheer futility of attempting to make your tiny personal mark. Occasionally, there's a collapsed, sun-bleached cabin or an abandoned tangle of rusted agricultural machinery to drive&#xa0;that point home.</p> <p>Mostly, this land has been divided up into national parks, places to visit but not to live in, places for people to walk upon lightly, leaving little trace. Just as the Native Americans lived, you can't help thinking \u2026 All that fighting, over land that remains too huge, too unyielding, for colonisation by mere people.</p> <p>Except that you see people all the time, everywhere. You can travel huge distances without seeing another car. But with each new vista comes another half-remembered vision \u2013 a&#xa0;barn-raising, a shootout, a cattle stampede. Visiting <a href=\"http://www.bodie.com/\" title=\"\">Bodie, a goldrush ghost town in the Mojave desert</a>, the eerie thing is not that the place feels abandoned. It's that it feels so densely populated. For all sorts of cultural reasons, you feel you know such places inside out.</p> <p>It's possible that prior to those three weeks I might have listened to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/04/michelle-obama-democratic-convention-live?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Michelle Obama's crowd-pleasing speech</a> to the Democratic convention with a measure of irritation. A beautiful woman in a&#xa0;beautiful dress, so accomplished a political wife that she's even been gifted with an effortless grasp of oratory, tells a&#xa0;huge nation to vote for her husband because she can personally vouch for his lovability, a lovability that inspired because he embodies the American Dream. It's not what you'd call policy-led, this approach. But in a nation so teeming with narrative, you're nothing without your own upbeat and positive story to tell. Both Obamas know that very well.</p> <p>However, the oddest thing about the&#xa0;way the American epic narrative seduces is that, even when you know that it's really a dream, a highly subjective and self-serving projection, its power is not diminished. On the contrary, it's heightened. Even&#xa0;as Michelle sought to argue that her husband was special, she sought at the same time to portray him as living proof that \"anyone\" can be&#xa0;president.</p> <p>It's so American, that duality, the way&#xa0;that a story can be simultaneously perfect truth and utter bullshit.</p> <p>Thus, for example, Europeans were great heroes for defeating the Native Americans, while at the same time Native Americans were so contemptibly lacking in go-get technological ambition that really they could barely be considered humans with rights at all. The Native American woman serving at the final gas station on the loneliest stretch of \"the loneliest road in America\" vouchsafed that her daughter had been&#xa0;suspended from school because she'd punched a girl who called her \"a&#xa0;wagon-burner\". How can any American, even a child, still feel the need to taunt someone because her ancestors defended themselves and their way of life from foreign invaders, in the way that any American would insist that she had the right to do?</p> <p>Because, perhaps, far from renouncing the violent imperialism on which their claim to that land was based, many of the descendents of the Europeans who&#xa0;went to the Americas still see themselves as deserving of primacy, of&#xa0;gratitude from those they subjugate, however brutally. I swear, though, until you have passed through that actual landscape, and watched as your own mind's eye populates it with endless scenes from John Wayne movies, it's hard to see how fully realised, how indestructibly accomplished, how psychologically real that shimmering dream of the US is.</p> <p>The Obama narrative offers a twist, in&#xa0;which the dream becomes open to all, as it is now supposed to be, and not just the paean to the founding fathers \u2013 the white men \u2013 that's carved into the rock as plainly as the portraits on Mount Rushmore. It's easy to see why so many Americans prefer not to admit that a twist is necessary or desirable, when the original narrative is so compelling. But they are wrong, all the same.</p> <p>I don't want to see the Obama presidency becorming a token single term, one that rose on the recently experienced calamities of those centuries of old, brutal imperialism, military and economic, and fell for want of the ability to solve them in fewer than&#xa0;four years. But I fear that many Americans want to see exactly that.</p> <p>On the road, as I took another tooth&#xa0;mug in another hired cabin from another airtight hygienic wrapping, or&#xa0;noted once again that a roadside lavatory in the middle of nowhere was&#xa0;remarkably well-stocked with disposable toilet covers, I found myself wondering if the US obsession with hygiene was linked to the history of US apartheid, an expression of a visceral racism that can no longer be otherwise expressed. The thought was so ugly that I pushed it to the back of my mind.</p> <p>Back in Britain, I went to see John Hillcoat's new film, Lawless.</p> <p>It's a prohibition-era western, and there's a brief scene in it in which a young man is seen drinking from a public water fountain marked \"whites\". Apart from that one short scene, there's no reference to racism in the film. All the characters are \"Caucasian\", as they say in the US. Lawless is based on a true story, of three hillbilly brothers who believe they are immortal. This liberating belief leads them to commit terrible violence (portrayed too realistically to look at), matched only by&#xa0;the violence of those who are meant&#xa0;to represent the law. The film may not be \"about\" racism. But it's a meditation on how nothing can be seen literally in black and white, good and bad, right and wrong, not even in the movies, not even in westerns. Yet Lawless adores the myth of America, even as it renounces it.</p> <p>The brilliance of Michelle Obama's speech was that it did the same thing. It addressed a problem that the US shares with Britain \u2013 how to insist that things must be improved, that terrible mistakes have been made, without appearing self-lacerating or dismissive of achievements that should be cherished. She resisted both elite-knocking and victim blame (which is something Britain could learn). And she's right. The&#xa0;epic story that America tells itself is&#xa0;indestructibly seductive. No matter how many times it's retold, it's not diminished. But it can be made even more powerful, truthful and universal.</p>",
  "<p>It was a lovely moment at Brands Hatch, laced not just with a sliver of alluring amateurism, but also with a sense of the strictures of competition shrinking just for a moment into the background of what is at bottom a celebration of sporting heart. A bronze medal for Great Britain's Rachel Morris in the women's individual H1-3 road race was a wonderful story of triumph against extreme adversity \u2013 or in fact additional extreme adversity \u2013 in its own right.</p> <p>Not only does Morris live with reflex sympathetic dystrophy, a hugely painful nerve condition that has led in turn to both her legs being amputated, she also suffered a dislocated shoulder in a collision with a car just weeks before these Games, destroying her bike and derailing her training regime at a single stroke. In the event Morris, who had ruled herself out of podium contention, was party to one of the moments of these Games, slowing as she approached the line in third place to link hands with her team-mate Karen Darke in a deliberate attempt to cross the line in a dead heat and thereby share the bronze. There was an additional gloss: this was the medal that would take Great Britain's total past 21, thereby surpassing the achievements of Beijing.</p> <p>For a moment there was even a suggestion it might come off. Morris and Darke were recorded as finishing in the same time, 1h 43min 08sec, and suggested initially they would refuse to accept the bronze unless it was shared between the two. This, though, was never going to wash with the race officials, who decided in a photo-finish that Morris had crossed the line marginally in front and awarded her the medal. Albeit not before several paddock wags had suggested both athletes might stand to be disqualified for refusing to race, just as the Brownlee bothers had been warned before the Olympics against staging a dead heat in the triathlon. Which, on a sweltering Kent day that saw this grand, slightly rickety old track thronged with a bank holiday-ish crowd, and buoyed a by large and celebratory Irish contingent, might just have sparked a minor venue revolt.</p> <p>\"We wanted it together. We crossed the line with our hands together. So hopefully we'll get a medal each \u2013 that's the plan,\" Morris said. \"We worked so hard together, so we'll both get on the podium together.\" It wasn't to be though. Darke, who is paralysed from the chest down after falling off a cliff aged 21, watched as Morris mounted the steps before returning to briefly drape the medal around her team-mate's neck in a lovely display of competitive generosity before all four fastest finishers \u2013 as opposed to the standard three \u2013 posed for the photographers. \"They both rode out of their skins and we're just as proud of them,\" the team's director Chris Furber said, confirming that none of the coaching staff had any idea what the two athletes had in mind as they approached the finish having failed to catch the American pair of Marianna Davis and Monica Basico.</p> <p>\"We were expecting a sprint finish between the two of them for the bronze and even discussing which one we each thought was going to get it,\" Furber said. \"Then with 150m to go it became apparent what was going to happen. It was just a really nice moment of friendship. They've been through a lot together in life and in training. As a coach you're entirely focused on medals and achievement but sometimes it's nice to see that at times friendship can take precedence over anything else in the sport.\"</p> <p>Darke, who had already won silver in the H1-2 time trial, is unlikely to spend too long dwelling on what was, in the end, an entirely sensible decision to deny her a share of the bronze. After returning home to Inverness she will resume preparations for an expedition to the South Pole, having previously crossed Greenland's ice cap on skis, climbed Mont Blanc, the Matterhorn and California's El Capitan, and hand-cycled all the way across Japan.</p> <p>This is a Paralympic sport of relatively recent vintage, having been introduced at the Athens Games of 2004. It is a discipline imported from the hand-bikes first introduced in the 1980s for non-disabled riders, and rapidly adopted as a brilliant boon to cycling for those with impairments to their legs. Riders pedal and steer with their hands, reaching extreme three-wheeled speeds and providing at Brands Hatch not just the spectacle of the Morris-Darke hand-clasp finish, but a day of elite racing that delighted a substantial crowd ranged around the steeply banked spectating ravines of this rather ramshackle venue.</p> <p>There is something deeply 1970s about Brands Hatch, a venerable track lodged in the green interior of Kent that hosted its last grand prix race a quarter of a century ago and still seems synonymous with an era of powerful aftershave, the James Hunt-esque medallion and the weekend machismo of the pre-modern racing circuit. Patched up, decorated with purple hoardings and fish and chip shacks and infused with a noticeably thirsty Irish contingent here to cheer on Mark Rohan in the H1 road race, the grounds had the air more of a well-stocked country fete than a high end Paralympic event.</p> <p>On the track though it was an exhilarating afternoon, marked first of all by Rohan's boisterously received gold medal. Rohan was an inter-county Gaelic footballer before suffering serious injuries in a motorbike accident in 2001. A poster boy in Ireland for both the summer Games, he has delivered gloriously here, having previously won gold in the time trial.</p> <p>After which the day's racing was rounded off by the spectacle of hand-cycling's reigning glamour boy, the extraordinary Alex Zanardi, who appeared to large, rolling cheers to compete in the men's H4 road race. Zanardi, of course, knows Brands Hatch rather well. A former Formula One driver, he lost both his legs in 2001 in a horrendous 220mph crash in a Champ Car race. Zanardi was resuscitated seven times on his way to hospital and lost vast amounts of blood but was up walking on prosthetic legs just months after the accident, even returning to motor racing in a specially adapted car.</p> <p>Now 45, and having taken up hand-cycling initially to keep fit, he won gold in the time trial on Wednesday, returning to a track that as a racing driver he negotiated in F3000 and then in the World Touring Car Championship, finishing second and third but never previously first. But Zanardi won a second gold in 2hr 32sec.</p> <p>His presence here leant a rather starry gloss as the shadows lengthened. Not to mention a reminder of the pure racing qualities of a sport that bears some similarities to motor racing with its emphasis on engineering refinements, attritional tactical elements and \u2013 for one day at least \u2013 a moment of Formula One-style collusion at the finish line that brought bronze for Great Britain and a gloriously memorable moment of camaraderie for those present in the&#xa0;stands.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Paul will be here from 4.30pm. Ish.</strong> In the meantime, take a look at Paul's pre-match thoughts on the blog:</p> <p>For too long the Republic of Ireland have behaved like Stoke City's idiot twin. During his four-year reign Giovanni Trapattoni has ordered Ireland to play like Tony Pulis's team despite having more creativity at his disposal and less power. There have been a few moments when that description didn't fit \u2013 a couple of good friendly wins and, most famously, the draw in Paris in the 2010 World Cup play-off, when Ireland played slickly only for the luck that had enabled them to make it that far to suddenly defect to the French\u2013 but overall Trapattoni's tenure has been characterised by double-barrelled perverseness: the manager persisting with tactics that make Ireland look worse than they actually are, and results contriving to make the manager's tactics appear better than they actually are. Until Euro 2012, that is. There the unsustainable pattern collapsed and Ireland copped three overdue thrashings, leaving Trapattoni's instructions looking as inspired as Clint Eastwood's chat with a chair.</p> <p>Stoke, of course, have given notice that they intend to add more nuance to their playing style, with Pulis recently buying some scheming central midfielders. Trapattoni, aware of the rising despair at his dogmatism, has hinted at a fresh approach too. He even gave a belated first start to James McCarthy during the August friendly in Serbia and the artful Wigan player will make his competitive debut when Ireland kick off their World Cup campaign in Kazakhstan on Friday.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/sep/06/giovanni-trapattoni-republic-ireland-change\">Article continues here</a></p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong><br>Welcome, shock-seekers. For I assume that you are tuning in because you are hoping to hear tell of either (a) Kazakhstan notching a famous victory that puts them on the football map and shunts Giovanni Trapattoni out the green door or (b) the Republic of Ireland showing hints of unpredictability and variety for the first time under the arch-dogmatist and igniting hope that real change is afoot. The Italian claims he has seen the light after years in the darkness resulted in him guiding the country witlessly into Euro 2012 humiliation, but he has yet to seriously back it up with actions. As mentioned in the blog thing below, the inclusion of James McCarthy is a step forward \u2013 even if it was pretty much forced on the manager by the suspension of Keith Andrews \u2013 and it will be interesting to see to with extent the Wigan youngster is allowed to receive the ball from full-backs, play it to team-mates and even run forward with it from a central position, all of which are enterprises that Trap has generally banned central midfielders from attempting. But several others inclusions, most glaringly those of Robbie Keane and Stephen Ward, plus the usual 4-4-2 formation, suggest the Italian is not truly for turning. The forecast, alas, must be for tepid fare and a 0-0 draw or possibly 0-1 away win.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Teams: </strong><br><strong>Kazakhstan: </strong> Sidelnikov; Kirov, Kislitsyn, Mukhtarov, Nurdauletov, Konysbayev, Bogdanov, Ostapenko, Shmidtgal, Nusserbayev, Rozkhov. <br><strong>Ireland:</strong> Westwood; O'Shea, O'Dea, St Ledger, Ward; Cox, Whelan, McCarthy, McGeady; Keane, Walters</p> <p>Ref: Avram Ionut (Romania)</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>4.53pm: The teams totter out on to the plastic pitch, to polite applause from a small crowd and ... combined German and English commentary on the feed I'm following it on: throw in a bit of Italian and we'd have authentic Trapattoni gobbedygook .</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>4.58pm: That Kazakh anthem is magnificent! A booming masterpiece that sounds like it is being propelled to the heavens from the very bowels of the earth, or perhaps a fanatical Laibach fan.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>5.02pm: The German in the gantry appears to have been made walk the plank ... and replaced by a plank, who so far has shared such insights as \"the Republic if Ireland have good fans\" and \"both sides will want to win here\".</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> Off we go. From kick-off Ireland work the ball immediately back to Ward, who smashes it 70 yards forward. Behold the brave new dawn!</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> After a bout of kick and rush from IReland, the ball breaks to McCarthy, whose low curling shot from the edge of the area is tipped behind for a corner. There follows another corner as O'Dea header is pushed behind. Walters meets the next one, but his header is deflected behind for yet another corner. This time McGeady's delivery eludes everyone. But the early evidence suggests the home side are hopeless in the air; and Ireland are certainly going to continue trying to exploit that.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> McGeady turns past a dazzled defender on the edge of the area before firing wide.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Kazakhstan have settled at last and, to the excitement of the suddenly very noisy fans, they piece together the first flowing move of the game, comprising up to five passes. There was a shot at the end of it but the camera lens isn't big enough to reveal exactly where it ended up. \"Be fair to the plank,\" blurts Casey Murphy of the 5.02pm comment. \"Reasonable observers might often wonder whether Trappatoni does want to win.\"</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Change? The Irish full-backs are hoofing the ball towards Walters at every opportunity. It's as if McCarthy isn't on the pitch. The Kazakhs are tidier and more imaginative in possession but have so far shown no sign of a cutting edge.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> In all fairness, this is abysmal from Ireland. \"It amazes me that the FAI lets Trappatoni pick the team without being obliged to attend any of his players' club games,\" fumes Justin Kavanagh. \"So it's hardly surprising that he picks the same players over and over. Televised games hide a multitude of weaknesses and failings. Consider a player like Keane, who may miss several games in the MLS, then play against a recently formed club and score handily. How could any coach draw any conclusion from the striker's form or fitness from watching by DVD? This is management by remote control. It strikes me that after the Staunton debacle, the FAI decided that a semi-retired coach doing half the job is their best bet, especially as someone else is paying his wages.\" It's low farce, is what it is.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>17 min: </strong> Kirov raids forward down the left in a way the Irish fullbacks would never be allowed to do. He then combines well with Nusserbayev and the reasonably impressive Ostapenko before Ireland eventually scramble to smother the attack.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> A mistake at the back by Kazakhstan gifts Ireland possession in a dangerous area but McGeady botches two good shooting opportunities.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Keane takes control of the ball in the opposing box, swivels, then shoots into the sidenetting. I didn't see how the chance came about and the TV people have apparently scrapped replays: it's as if they just want to get this match over and done with it as quickly as possible ... \"Am I the only Irish fan who hopes Kazakhstan win?\" Hugh Collins dares to ask. \"In the long run, it may be the best thing for the ireland team. Colemand, McCarthy et al could easily end up just refusing to play for Ireland if this continues.\"</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Westwood hurtles off his line to dive at the feet of Konysbayev as Kazakhstan continue to apply a helter-skelter sort of pressure.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Ireland produce their most intricate piece of play so far and, lo and behold, they create a decent chance. McGeady coolly picked out Cox, who swapped quick passes Keane before firing into the sidenetting.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Trapattoni's strategy for coping with the plastic pitch appears to be to keep the ball in the air as much as possible ...</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> This is brainless stuff from Ireland. Kazakhstan are clearly a weak team but Trapattoni's men are playing to such a frill-free game plan that the hosts are almost comfortable. It would not take much passing and movement to carve this team up, but Ireland's preference is for punts and bluster.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> The keeper comes to try to catch a McGeady freekick from the left and gets just enough of a touch to take it off the head of O'Dea. The ensuing corner comes to nothing.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Kazakhstan make it into Ireland's half for the first time in about five minutes and, after, a couple of dinky passes, Bogdanov's attempted shot is charge down by St Ledger and Whelan.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> O'Shea provides an overlap for the first time in the game and duly receives the ball from McGeady. But his subsequent cross is dross. Elsewhere, Kerzakhov has just hit the post for Russia, who are still 1-0 up against Northern Ireland with 13 minutes to go.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Kazakhstan 1-0 Rep of Ireland (Nuradauletov 37')</strong> <br>Despite the palpable inferiority of the opposition, Ireland have not aspired to do anything more than the most rudimentary tasks of football so far, and now they have failed to meet even that low standard: Nuradauletov was allowed to jump and meet a Shmidtgal frrekick from eight yards and he sent his header into the net.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> Cripes! The Kazakhs almost make it two! Ireland are a shambles and after Westwood parried a long shot, a home player rushed on to the rebound and clattered it against the post!</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> The hosts seem buoyed by their goal and playing with extra dynamism: they don't look like giving up their lead as easily as they got it ... and so far Ireland don't look producing anything intelligent enough to get back into the game. If this approach doesn't change, and if McClean and Long don't come on at half-time, it will be an outrage.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> Trapattoni has got 10 minutes to abandon decades-old principles. Optimistic?</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Green mist</strong> \"I'm with Hugh Collins,\" announces Justin Kavanagh. \"The best thing that could happen is if this pretence at running an international team is exposed tonight by Kazakhstan on the plastic pitch. Workers in the former Soviet Union had a saying 'they pretend to pay us, and we pretend to work'. The Irish players' take on that tonight would be 'he pretends to coach us, and we pretend to play.'\"</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Unacceptable</strong>, that's what this has been, especially after all the clapTrap about change. It's the stupidity of the approach that is so infuriating: Ireland simply could not have deployed a game plan less likely to expose Kazakhstan's limitations and more likely to hide Ireland's modest but superior skills. In a sense this half has been more dispiriting that then 5-2 defeat to Cyprus that did for Stan Staunton, because rather than disjointed farce, this is organised incompetence.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> NO CHANGES AT HALF-TIME! Change the manager now, I'm saying.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Hooof! O'Shea eschews a pass into midfield to kindly give the ball back to Kazakhstan.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> The first shot of the second half comes in from Nussebayev, who took the ball down on his thigh and then blasted over from 20 yards. Goal kick to Ireland ... and ten seconds later Kazakhstan have the ball back, courtesy of more Trap-pleasing hoofery. This cannot go on!</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> It's the willful dumbness of this performance by Ireland that makes it so outrageous. And it's encouraging the Kazakhs, who are pinging the ball around in a way that Ireland refuse to do and looking marginally the more dangerous of two mostly blunt sides.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> The commentator seems to think Kevin Doyle could be the answer off the bench. And while it's probable that he'd do better than Keane, who has barely touched the ball (and, in fairness, barely been given a pass that he could be reasonably expected to do anything with), Doyle's omission was one Trap decision I agreed with : the Wolves striker has been below par for a while now. Long and McClean would be a much better bet, and Coleman on the right. I only mention this because there has been nothing else to mention in the last few minutes. This is pap.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Ireland substitution:</strong> OK, here comes Doyle. Off goes Cox.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> There is a pause in the game because a Kazakh player is injured. And possibly also because the Irish players have a mutiny to plot? \"I'm sensing you're a bit down on Trap,\" notes canny Simon McMahon. \"But at least you were at Euro 2012. I'm one of I suspect many Scotland fans who would give their right arm for three thrashings at a major finals.\" I said at the time that Ireland were lucky to get to the Euros and such success was unsustainable with Trap's methods.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> OK, the Kazakh has recovered and \"play\" has resumed. I think.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> McGeady, who has probably touched the ball more than any other Irish player, receives an actual pass wide on the left, behind the defender. He could so some damage here ... but he treads on the ball and knocks it out of play, then re-enacts Edvard Munch's scream. A nation does likewise.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>67 min:</strong> The Kazakh keeper comes to claim another aimless cross. \"You got a bum assignment there, Paul&lt;\" scoffs Victor Bear. \"While you tear off your goatee, watching the Trap kill Irish football one hoofed ball at a time, I'm watching Liechtenstein play Boznia-Herz in a stadium that makes the old Plough Lane look like the Nou Camp. Liechtenstein are very much the Irish of this contest, sitting behind the ball, waiting for the apocalypse. The BH fans are doing the reverse Poznan in the stand, which consists of jumping up and down while actually watching the game (somebody should point this practical adjustment out to the Poznan fans). I think it's still 0-0 after 20 min, but I get distracted every time they show a shot with those magnificent snow-capped Alps in the background.\" Ireland are not sitting behind the ball, they are scurrying underneath it.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Hopeful squeals from the crowd as Nusserbayev tries his luck from 25 yards ... his shot is well-struck, but it fizzes inches wide. And on that note, Nusserbayev is replaced by Jolcheyv. Trapattoni, meanwhile, apparently sees no reason to make any more substitutions yet.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> At last! Another substitution from Ireland and on comes Long. Off goes Walters. But where is McClean?</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Sidelnikov clasps a 30-yard Whelan shot to his chest and, perhaps, stifles a laugh.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>75 min: </strong> Kazakhstan deal easily with a 40-yard freekick sent into their box by Whelan. \"This is horrific,\" screams Paul Rock. \"I'm sitting in Dublin watching this and when I look out the window I see kids playing hurling and rugby in the street. They have no interest in this game. By sticking with Trap, the FAI have set back soccer in Ireland by years. We were never a great nation, but always had a few players in each generation that would encourage kids to play. Trap has killed all love or enjoyment in Irish football. This is a sad day. Also a milestone\u2026.a nadir in our football history.\" But at least we seem to have some wise kids.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> The best chance of the second half so far is created by the only team that has tried to be creative: Jolchev peels of St Ledger and receives a pass into his path, but his Westwood diverts his 16-yard shot behind for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Lots of bluster around the Kazakh box now, but still no sign of Ireland summoning the wit to penetrate. \"I made the wise decision to not watch the game so am just following your MBM,\" sighs Darragh Thomas. \"I'm not even sure I want us to qualify for Brazil. I love the World Cup anyway, I don't need us to compete in it to enjoy it. I definitely would have enjoyed the Euros more had we not have taken part. There was about 20 of us having a great day in a beer garden, having a great day half watching Spain v Italy. We all pile back to a friends house to watch the Ireland game properly. By half time the mood was absolutely miserable.\"</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> As Sidelnikov comes to claim another long ball, the commentator reckons \"it's just a case of pumping the ball into the box for Ireland at this stage\". Erm, that's all they've been trying to do all game.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> All too easy for Kazakhstan. Simply by keeping their shape and jumping above Ireland's small forwards, they are protecting their lead comfortably.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Penalty to Ireland! Rozkhov pushed Keane over to stop him latching on to an error by Mukhtarov.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Kazakhstan 1-1 Ireland (Keane pen 88')</strong> Keane sends the keeper the wrong way, which, regardless of how this match ends, is the direction that Ireland are still heading under Trap.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Kazakhstan 1-2 Ireland (Doyle 89')</strong> A totally undeserved but very well taken winner, courtesy of Doyle, who raced on to a Ward header and thundered a volley into the net from 16 yards. Jamnation once again for Trap.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>90 mins:</strong> Kazakhstan are trying to snatch a late equaliser but they are broken. \"This is the worst thing that could have happened,\" sobs Nilly Murphy, who does not need to elaborate.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>Full-time: </strong> Three points is unjustly lavish reward for the one simple-minded idea that guided Ireland through this match. Hats off, at least, to the spirit of the Irish players who at least showed spirit amid the witless assignment given to them by lucky Trap. \"Despite what Trappatoni will say about results, no one Irish will remember this result with any pride, and noone will be able to forget such an abject performance,\" sums up Justin Kavanagh. Right, I'm off to MBM Wales v Belgium, which should prove to be an entirely different sport to what we've just witnessed.</p>",
  "<p>It might not be long until Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's presidential term comes to an end but he doesn't seem to believe it will finally happen. During a <a href=\"http://www.lenziran.com/2012/09/ahmadinejad-live-on-tv-how-do-you-know-that-the-life-of-governement-is-over-in-one-year/\">recent interview</a> on state television in which a journalist mentioned that his presidency would finish within a year, the president interjected, laughing: \"How do you know?\"</p> <p>Under Iranian law Ahmadinejad cannot run for a third term, and on Friday officials announced the next election would be held on 14 June 2013. The last was in 2009 when Ahmadinejad took office for a second term amid allegations of fraud and unrest. </p> <p>The president's joking response prompted speculation that he planned to preserve his dwindling power by grooming someone in his inner circle as his possible successor. Ahmadinejad's opponents pointed the finger at his close confidant and chief of staff, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/21/ahmadinejad-iran-successor-wikileaks\">Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei</a>, as a likely candidate. </p> <p>Mohammad Dehghan, who sits on the parliament's executive board, criticised Ahmadinejad and accused him of pursuing a Putin/Medvedev-style reshuffle. </p> <p>\"Ahmadinejad should know that Iran is not Russia and he is not Putin. Ahmadinejad's Medvedev [a reference to Mashaei] has no position among the public opinion and he will not have any position in future,\" he said, according to the semi-official Mehr news agency. The president's office <a href=\"http://www.mehrnews.com/en/newsdetail.aspx?NewsID=1690208\">denied</a> suggestions that Mashaei would put his name forward for the presidency. </p> <p>Mashaei fell foul of conservatives after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/19/ahmadinejad-iran-power-struggle\">a power struggle last year</a> between supporters of Ahmadinejad and those close to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Khamenei's supporters believe that the confrontation stemmed from the increasing influence of Mashaei, an opponent of greater involvement of clerics in politics, whom they described as the head of a \"deviant current\" within the president's inner circle.</p> <p>Speculation is rife about who will be Ahmadinejad's successor. Tehran's mayor, Mohammad-Bagher Ghalibaf, is one name often mentioned. Another is Saeed Jalili, the chief nuclear negotiator and a close ally of Khamenei. Many also tip Ali Larijani, the parliamentary speaker. </p> <p>One thing is clear: whoever takes the mandate, it will not be Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.</p>",
  "<p>Air Jordans or Blazers is the question. I'm getting dressed for a very important meeting, so I'd better get it right. Which means I'd better go with the bright pink Blazers. (By the way, what I'm referring to here is not a type of jacket, but rather a pair of Nike trainers.) Definitely jeans, that's always a safe bet. No doubt most of my colleagues will be in formal attire for this meeting, so I also prepare myself for the inevitable teasing that's coming my way.</p> <p>When I began my career at a college, management and some colleagues took umbrage to a teacher in trainers, jeans and, sometimes, a baseball cap. At 24, I wasn't in a mid-life crisis, it was just the way I chose to present myself to the world. But to them, an academic was expected to dress differently and comments such as: \"You don't dress like a teacher\", \"Ever considered wearing a tie?\", \"Do you feel trainers are appropriate for a staff meeting (pink ones at that)?\" and \u2013 my personal favourite \u2013 \"Well if you dressed more like a staff member you wouldn't get mistaken for a student\", soon formed the soundtrack to my early teaching career.</p> <p>The reactions from my peers, then as now, have often made me question my attitude to formal dress. Am I just trying to be rebellious? Would a shirt and tie really give me more authority in a classroom?</p> <p>My old headmistress would have thought so. Mrs Bannister had three deputy heads under her (all men incidentally) and, trust me, the students \u2013 and probably most of the members of staff \u2013 thought twice before messing with her. Her vast collection of grey suits were designed for one thing and one thing only: keeping 800 adolescents in check. And it worked, at least for the most part. But I've taken a different approach. Though I sometimes wished my college students would smarten up, I had a great rapport with them and it was built while trading comments on trainers and jeans. My dress sense helped me connect with what was described as a 'hard to reach' class.</p> <p>Do I have to dress like Mrs Bannister to establish my power? Working in a university, I see my role more as that of a facilitator of learning \u2013 so do I still need to have the whole shirt, tie and tweed going on? If not, do the comments I keep getting have more to do then with some concept of tradition? I wonder what it is I am expected to show reverence for: academic tradition or the institution? I value what I do and try and do it to the best of my ability, but I don't have to be formally dressed to be a good academic. What's more, my clothes reflect my working life. As a dual professional (with one foot in academia and the other in the creative industries) jeans and trainers are comfortable and manageable.</p> <p>As I gear up for a new term, I know that building rapport with my students, while being able to establish a sense of authority, will be crucial. Wearing Nikes won't guarantee me instant credibility or respect, nor will it incentivise my students to always come prepared to engage. But the way I dress is a statement about my personality that feeds into my teaching style. Our clothes communicate on our behalf and mine allow me to connect with my class in ways, and at speeds, I could scarcely achieve in my assigned contact hours.</p> <p>Colleagues who teach more traditional subjects, will no doubt gently rib me about my choice of clothing at some point in this academic year. Yet, I know we're on the same page about what we want to achieve in the lecture theatre, and the kind of environment we want to create for all our students. So as I prepare my lectures for the start of term, I will also prepare my wardrobe. No tweed, no corduroys, no elbow patches - just yet. Mortarboards are strictly reserved for graduation. Instead you'll find me in Jordans, Dunks and Air Max \u2013 and forever in jeans.</p> <p><em>Lawrence Lartey is an associate lecturer at <a href=\"http://www.arts.ac.uk/\">The University of the Arts London</a>, at LCC, in the faculty of media.

  "<p>The young mechanic had lost the sight in his right eye during the battle of Daraya. Still, he searched for his missing father for three days, combing destroyed buildings and piles of rubble. He finally found the old man dead on the outskirts of town, at a farm with three other bodies, boys aged 16-20. \"Why kill an old man?\" he asks.</p> <p>He is not the only one to ask the question. An estimated 500 people were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/28/syria-worst-massacre-daraya-death-toll-400\" title=\"\">slaughtered in Daraya</a> over two and a half days at the end of last month. Rebels and the government accuse each other. Left behind is a town destroyed beyond recognition.</p> <p>According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), which has interviewed Daraya residents and analysed satellite images of the battle, evidence points towards government responsibility for the killings, although it is not clear whether uniformed men or the shabiha militia carried out the killings after the town was bombed by helicopters and shelled.</p> <p>\"What we don't know yet is who did the dirty work, the executions \u2013 whether it was men in uniform or <em>shabiha</em>,\" says HRW's Ole Solvang. \"We're still investigating.\"</p> <p>Witnesses speak of intense shelling from helicopters with mounted machine guns, mortars from a government military airport near the Mezzah neighbourhood, and snipers in buildings in the north of the city. They speak of bodies lying in the street, and groups of civilians hiding underground only to be found and summarily killed.</p> <p>Shortly after the events, in an extraordinary act of indecency, the pro-regime television journalist Micheline Azar, entered the town to interview the dying, sticking her microphone in front of their bloody and wounded faces. She said the killings were \"in the name of freedom\". Not even children were spared her intrusions.</p> <p>\"It was horrific,\" says Reem, a Daraya resident. \"She was a vulture. She went through the crowds talking to the wounded as though she was floating on water, as though there was not this scene of hell in front of her.\"</p> <h2>Ghost town</h2> <p>Two weeks on, Daraya still stinks of death. A poor Sunni suburb south of Damascus, it had been well known for furniture-making, and for its peaceful resistance before the conflict. Now it is a ghost town of shattered glass and broken graveyard walls, bombed vegetable shops and decapitated blocks of flats. Rank rubbish is piled on corners, uncollected. There is the unmistakable smell of rotting corpses that have not yet been removed from houses. A lone bicyclist makes his way awkwardly through the rubble and debris.</p> <p>The town is still and lifeless. There is no way to confirm the death tally. It ranges from opposition reports of more than 1,000 to government figures of several hundred. The local gravedigger says he has already buried 1,000, and more bodies are found every day. The mounds of freshly dug, moist earth in the cemetery in the middle of town look like they harbour at least several hundred dead.</p> <p>A woman who comes to the graveyard each day to check a list for news of her sons says: \"We are still searching houses and abandoned ruins trying to find them.\" She says everyone waits for the hour when the gravedigger arrives and there are new bodies to identify.</p> <p>In the ashen aftermath of war, it is impossible to imagine what this place looked like before, or what really happened here. It was first bombed, the centre flattened, before house-to-house operations were conducted. Some witnesses say men and boys were killed at close range with guns; others say knives were used.</p> <p>\"The problem is there is no food, no water, no electricity,\" says one family. Outside, two children play amid the rubble. \"There's nothing to do, no one to play with,\" says six-year-old Rauda. \"My friends left when the bombing started. I stayed close to my mother and held her. But she said we were not leaving.\"</p> <p>Many fear becoming refugees as much as they fear the violence. \"Would you leave your home?\" asks Rashid, who owned a shop, now destroyed. \"Would you take your life apart? We leave with our heads high, or we don't leave at all.\"</p> <p>The attack on Daraya started on 20 August and intensified two days later. The Free Syrian Army withdrew from the town on 23 August and the army entered the next day. \"The shelling started at 7.30am. There is no sound more frightening than rockets,\" says Rashid.</p> <p>People hid in basements, and when the army arrived some were pulled out and killed outside; others were sprayed with machine-gun fire, Rashid says. \"We had some informers who pointed out where opposition people were. They let the women run away but they shot the men one by one. In some cases, they went into the basement and killed old men and children \u2013 just because they were boys.\" His wife's four brothers and three nephews were among the victims.</p> <h2>Secret graves</h2> <p>A woman called Umm Hussein says she was rushing to escape the bombardment with her young daughter and 20-year-old son when a truck went by with soldiers shouting: \"With our life, with our blood we will fight for Bashar.\" Umm Hussein and her children did not make it in time: they were stopped and, while she and her daughter were spared, her son was shot and his body taken out of town. There are rumours that some victims are being moved to secret graves, in an eerie reprise of Srebrenica.</p> <p>But other people say the regime soldiers fed them and provided medical attention to the wounded. \"They gave us bread,\" one man says. \"Not all of them were monsters.\"</p> <p>Will Daraya be a turning point in the conflict? Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN's special envoy, sent to the region after Kofi Annan's resignation, has said he is under no illusions about the difficulty he will face. Three months earlier the Houla massacre was also called a turning point.</p> <p>\"We are waiting for God, waiting for victory,\" says Rashid, looking around his wasted street. \"But victory doesn't seem very soon now.\"</p>",
  "<p>French investigators say the murder of a British man and three others on the edge of a secluded Alpine forest bears the hallmarks of a professional assassination as they revealed they were investigating allegations there had been a money dispute in the family.</p> <p>The increasing belief among investigators that Saad al-Hilli was targeted means attention will focus on his private and professional life as they search for clues to any motive for the massacre.</p> <p>French investigators said one line of inquiry was an alleged family dispute, said to have involved a wrangle over property. French officials stressed this was one line of inquiry among others.</p> <p>A French gendarme was due to fly to London on Friday afternoon to coordinate the inquiry with the British authorities.</p> <p>The dead man's brother Zaid al-Hilli was reported by AFP to have gone to a police station.</p> <p>French media reported that the brother had contacted British police and denied any involvement. French investigators have stressed that even if there was a family dispute, it is a considerable leap to link it to the cold-blooded killings of three adults and the violent beating of a young girl at a mountain beauty spot.</p> <p>\"We received information from the British authorities about a money dispute between two brothers of this family,\" state prosecutor Eric Maillaud told Reuters. \"It's an interesting line of investigation, but one among many.\"</p> <p>Saad al-Hilli, died from a bullet to the head along with his wife, his 77-year-old mother-in-law and a French cyclist, all gunned down near Lake Annecy close to the Swiss border.</p> <p>Eric Maillaud, the French public prosecutor, told the Guardian detectives from France and the UK were cooperating \"100%\". He added that the relationship between Saad al-Hilli, a 50-year-old aerospace engineer, and his brother and rumours of a dispute over money and a family inheritance were a line of inquiry \"for the moment\".</p> <p>Maillaud said the brother had not been interviewed formally by the British police.</p> <p>Maillaud said police had found a further 10 bullet casings following the removal of the al-Hilli family's BMW estate car from the isolated car park at the end of the narrow and winding Route de la Combe d'Ire, bringing the total number of casings to 25 and suggesting there may have been more than one weapon or gunman.</p> <p>\"This bears of the hallmarks of a professional assassination and there was an absolute determination to kill shown by the bullets in the head of the victims, and the savagery of the attack on the elder girl. It does seem like an ambush, but we cannot be sure at this stage that it was a professional assassination.</p> <p>\"Was the family targeted? Honestly we don't know. The hypothesis (of a family row) has come out strong because there appears to have been some legal action between the brothers. It has risen to the top, but it's still just one line of inquiry because there is also the profession of the victim and even the fact that he was born in Iraq, that might be important.\"</p> <p>He added: \"All we know for now is that a human drama has happened and we have to find out why as quickly as possible.\"</p> <p>The bodies of Saad al-Hilli, his wife Iqbal, 47, and a 77-year-old woman believed to be Mrs al-Hilli's mother, as well as the French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, a local father-of-three, were removed from the scene on Thursday afternoon. The al-Hillis' two daughters, Zainab, seven, who was shot in the shoulder and suffered devastating head injuries, and four-year-old Zeena who hid terrified in the rear footwell under the bodies of her dead mother and grandmother for eight hours before being found, were still both in hospital.</p> <p>The public prosecutor said investigators were anxious to speak to the elder girl who was \"a key witness\" but had to be bound by doctors' advice. He said her condition was improving but she was still unable to speak.</p> <p>Zeena has been interviewed by detectives in the presence of an English-speaking representative from the British Embassy and will be questioned \"gently\" again on Friday.</p> <p>\"Physically she is very well; she is being protected by a gendarme and has a nurse with her. She has been told her family is dead. I don't know how you tell a four-year-old that she will never see her family again, but she knows,\" Maillout said.</p> <p>\"She is only four so what she has been able to tell us is more about the ambiance. She has spoken of hearing noises and cries and told us she was afraid so she hid. Our priority now is to get this poor little girl reunited with one of her relatives and back with family members. I understand there are members of the family ready to come to France to get her.</p> <p>\"The elder girl is not in a state to speak and we will have to wait for a go-ahead from the doctors before talking to her. She is a key witness for us.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 September 2012 because the original said Lake Annecy is on the Swiss border.

  "<p>There is a famous Monty Python sketch called \"Four Yorkshiremen\". It portrays tuxedo-wearing men sipping fine red wine, chomping on cigars and eagerly reminiscing about their impoverished childhoods. The conversation quickly turns into a bizarre arm's race of boasting about humble origins when even living in a hole is seen as the height of luxury. Soon, one man is claiming to have grown up \"in a lake\", prompting one companion to exclaim:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"You were lucky to have a lake!

According to their own stories, speaker after speaker detailed their family's rise from poverty to success in the space of a generation or two. In order to praise the powerful myth of the American Dream, both Republicans and Democrats battled to outdo each other with origin stories of deprived woe.</p> <p>Here, for example, is <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80348.html\">Rick Santorum, praising the memory of his Italian immigrant coal-mining grandfather</a>. \"My grandfather mined coal until he was 72 years old \u2026 working the mines may not have been the dream he dreamed \u2013 I never dared to ask him \u2013 but I think his answer would have been that America gave him more than he had ever hoped,\" Santorum opined, though surely anyone would hope for more than working in a coal pit until well past 70.</p> <p>But that was just for starters. <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80413.html\">Former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty could top that</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"My dad was a truck driver.

Even \u2013 staggeringly \u2013 super-rich Mitt Romney <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/08/30/transcript-mitt-romney-speech-at-rnc/\">joined in</a>. \"My dad had been born in Mexico and his family had to leave during the Mexican revolution,\" Mitt said. \"I grew up with stories of his family being fed by the US government as war refugees.\"</p> <p>Make no mistake, though, this posturing was a thoroughly bipartisan affair. <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/04/160574895/transcript-julian-castros-dnc-keynote-address\">Here is new Democratic Hispanic leader Julian Castro, the mayor of San Antonio</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"My grandmother was an orphan \u2026 She never made it past the fourth grade. She had to drop out and start working to help her family. My grandmother spent her whole life working as a maid, a cook and a babysitter, barely scraping by.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Or <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/80673.html\">listen to Illinois congressional candidate Tammy Duckworth</a>. \"Mom took in sewing. My 55-year-old dad tried to find work. But at 15, I was the only one with a job \u2013 after school, for minimum wage. Thank God for the food stamps,\" she told the Charlotte gathering. </p> <p>From the famous to the unknown, everyone got in on the act. <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/videos/2012/09/06/scarlett-johansson-addresses-dnc.html\">Hollywood star Scarlett Johansson was not to be denied</a>. \"My father barely made enough to get by. We moved every year, and we finally settled in a housing development for lower middle-income families,\" she said, though that hardly sounds too Dickensian. But <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/04/160578836/transcript-michelle-obamas-convention-speech\">Michelle Obama could make up for that</a>. \"My father was a pump operator at the city water plant, and he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when my brother and I were young,\" she reminisced. </p> <p>It is important to say there is no doubt these stories are true. They are also moving, showing the brave struggles and sacrifices that one generation can make for another, or the sheer obstacles that some individuals have overcome to achieve high office. But in the context of the propaganda jamborees that are modern conventions, they are being used to make a political point: the American Dream came true for me and it can for you, too. Increasingly, however, evidence for the truth of that sentiment is seriously wanting. </p> <p>Despite the heartwarming tales emerging from both sides of the political aisle, social mobility in America is under serious threat. In many ways, if you are to be born poor, you would be better-off being born somewhere else in the developed world than in the United States of America. Your chances of improving your social lot are likely to be better. As <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/howard-steven-friedman/class-mobility_b_1676931.html\">Columbia University Professor Howard Steven Friedman writes, about the work of the Economic Mobility Project</a>, the prospects of bettering oneself in the US can be worse than in many other developed countries, even class-ridden Britain. Friedman points out that an American male's income is nearly twice as reliant on his father's background as a Canadian's. Another study showed some 42% of American sons of fathers born in the poorest fifth of society ended up in that fifth themselves. That compares to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/howard-steven-friedman/class-mobility_b_1676931.html\">30% in the UK, and a range of 25-28% in Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/05/us/harder-for-americans-to-rise-from-lower-rungs.html?pagewanted=all\">A separate report</a>, by University of Ottawa Professor Miles Corak in 2006, reviewed 50 mobility studies of nine countries. He, too, ranked the Scandinavian nations and Canada as the most likely to be socially mobile, with the US and the UK bringing up the rear. But just in case you had any doubts, the Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has also got in on the argument. In his recent book, The Price of Inequality, <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/american-dream-myth-joseph-stiglitz-price-inequality-124338674.html\">he writes that America's growing gap between the rich and the rest of us has decreased social mobility</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"America has the least equality of opportunity of any of the advanced industrial economies.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Many believe the nub of America's problem is with the very poor, skewing the figures for the country as a whole. As <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/the-american-dream-is-now-a-myth-2012-6\">the first graph in this Business Insider story shows</a> the real difference between a socially mobile country, like Denmark, and a less mobile one like the US <em>is</em> with the bottom fifth of society. Elsewhere on the spectrum, countries are much more comparable. Which makes the \"poverty arm's race\" on display in Tampa and Charlotte all the more misleading: if you are really born on the \"wrong side of the tracks\" in today's America, you are much more likely to stay there than end up testifying to a national convention about your remarkable rise out of deprivation.</p> <p>As America's politicians outdid each other to try and show how far they had come, the reality on the ground now is making those journeys longer and far more difficult. Unlike the Monty Python sketch, that is not funny.</p>",
  "<p>The British producer of a play that highlights the difficulties of being gay in Uganda has been charged with a criminal offence after the production was staged despite a ban by regulators. The offence carries a sentence of two years in jail.</p> <p>The Ugandan Media Council sent a letter to David Cecil, producer of The River and the Mountain, on 16 August saying it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/29/play-homosexuality-cancelled-uganda-regulators\" title=\"\">considering whether to grant the play clearance to be performed</a>.</p> <p>\"In the meantime,\" read the letter, \"this play is not to be staged in any theatre or public place in Uganda.\" The play's run at the National Theatre was cancelled but it was performed at two small venues in the capital Kampala.</p> <p>\"I was called in by the police and spoken to by several officers from the media offences department of the CID [Criminal Investigation Directorate],\" said Cecil. \"They said that by staging the play I have disobeyed the Media Council, which is a public authority. I've been charged with that offence and they are now considering whether to press on with the case. But I had only taken their letter to be advisory, not the law.\"</p> <p>\"The offence of disobedience of lawful orders carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison,\" said Cecil's lawyer John Francis Onyango. \"There is no option for a fine, so if convicted it would be a jail term. However I am confident we can win the case. They must conclusively establish that this was disobedience, rather than the chance that the letter was misunderstood.\"</p> <p>Ugandan ethics minister Simon Lokodo said the play was not granted clearance because \"this play is justifying the promotion of homosexuality in Uganda, and Uganda does not accommodate homosexual causes. We will put pressure on anyone saying that this abomination [homosexuality] is acceptable.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Democratic party's euphoria at the close of its party convention in Charlotte evaporated within hours when the US government published a dismal set of unemployment figures that threatened Barack Obama's re-election chances.</p> <p>Obama had fired up the party faithful with a speech that pleaded for a second term but recognised that economic recovery would be slow. \"I won't pretend the path I'm offering is quick or easy,\" he said.</p> <p>But on Friday morning, the department of labor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/07/us-adds-only-96k-jobs-august\">revealed that the US economy had added only 96,000 jobs in August</a>, well below expectations. The figures undermined the president's oft-repeated argument that his policies, while slow to bring results, are on the right track.</p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney declared the figures to be an indictment of Obama's economic policies. \"If last night was the party, this morning is the hangover. For every net new job created, nearly four Americans gave up looking for work entirely,\" Romney said.</p> <p>The White House response to the unemployment figures was muted, saying the economy is continuing to recover but more work remained to be done.</p> <p>Republicans are banking on the sluggish economy to take them to the White House. There are two more sets of unemployment figures still to be published, the last just four days before the election on 6 November. No US president since the Great Depression has won re-election with unemployment so high.</p> <p>Democrats had been buoyed by their three-day convention, dominated by an inspired speech from Bill Clinton on Wednesday night and Obama's more pragmatic address late on Thursday night.</p> <p>But the jobs figures cast a pall over the celebrations. Although the headline figures showed a drop from 8.3% to 8.1% the fall was mainly attributed to people giving up the search for work. Only 96,000 new jobs were created in August compared with 141,000 in July \u2013 well below the rate of population growth. Pressure is building on the Federal Reserve, when it meets on 12 September, to intervene to stimulate the economy.</p> <p>With the conventions over, the election campaign now begins in earnest and voters beginning to pay attention. Obama, within hours of his convention speech in which he formally accepted the party's nomination to fight the election, headed off early Friday morning on a punishing campaign schedule that took in Iowa and New Hampshire and a two-day bus trip across Florida beginning Saturday.</p> <p>The Obama campaign teams admits the election is going to be close. Polls have shown Obama and Romney almost neck-and-neck for months. A Reuters/Ipsos poll on Thursday put Romney on 45% to Obama's 44%.</p> <p>Over the next two weeks, with voters more fully engaged in the campaigns, the coming polls will provide the first genuine indication of who is likely to win the White House.</p> <p>The Obama campaign team and supporting groups splurged on ads over the summer, spending an estimated $120m mainly negative campaigns portraying Romney as rich, uncaring and out-of-touch.</p> <p>But now it is the turn of the Romney campaign to spend big, releasing on Friday 15 new television ads in eight battleground states. Over the next two months, the Romney campaign, backed by Super Pacs \u2013 political action committees formed by small groups of mainly wealthy supporters \u2013 is expected to outspend Obama by two to one.</p> <p>The Democrats nevertheless had the better of the conventions. The Republican event in Tampa, Florida, was disrupted by hurricane Isaac and there was a palpable lack of enthusiasm for Romney as the GOP's presidential candidate. The delegates were overwhelmingly white and generally older.</p> <p>The Democratic convention was also disrupted by weather. Obama's speech had to be moved from a 73,000-seater football stadium to a 23,000-seater smaller arena, leaving disappointed ticket-holders, mainly party volunteers, to line up for seats at a screening in the nearby convention centre. The thunderstorms that party officials had cited as the reason for the venue change failed to materialise. Republicans claimed it was moved because Obama would not be able to fill the stadium and feared television images of empty seats.</p> <p>But the Democratic convention had more energy, with a party atmosphere in Charlotte. The delegates were more representative of America, much more diverse than the Republicans in terms of ethnic background, with more young people and a 50-50 split between men and women.</p> <p>After Clinton's barnstormer on Wednesday, Obama struck a more low-key approach on Thursday, his tone more subdued compared with the sense of euphoria he created at the Denver convention four years ago.</p> <p>The more sober approach was deliberate, a recognition of the mood of disenchantment among some voters, tired of fine oratory and more interested in his plans for a second term.</p> <p>Obama hinted that he would, if re-elected, embark on a bold and ambitious Franklin Roosevelt-style New Deal programme, but offered few details.</p> <p>Instead, he called for patience.\"You didn't elect me to tell you what you wanted to hear. You elected me to tell you the truth. And the truth is it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades,\" he said.</p> <p>Obama was careful to recognise his own shortcomings, at one point telling the crowd that one of the differences from 2008 was that he was \"far more mindful of my own failings, knowing exactly what Lincoln meant when he said: 'I have been driven to my knees many times by the overwhelming conviction that I had no place else to go.'\"</p> <p>Among Obama supporters leaving the arena after the speech, Sandy Blakney, 54, a psychiatrist from the Raleigh area of North Carolina, said she understood why Obama had adopted a low-key approach.</p> <p>\"He did a little bit of the soaring rhetoric but in general his tone was a little more subdued, a little bit more serious,\" she said. This reflected the gravity of the economic crisis he faced on taking office.</p> <p>She added another reason. \"He does not want people to think he has become over-confident.\"</p>",

A good time, then, for the emergence of Oddience. They're a trio from LA making a poppy kind of rap and hip-hoppy R&amp;B that's jazzy, light, heady, psychedelic, playful, intoxicating and intoxicated. Drugs? \"We step to the beat of our own drums,\" they sing. It's all very <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/outkast\" title=\"\">Outkast</a>, with nods also to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/gnarlsbarkley\" title=\"\">Gnarls Barkley</a>. The raps are stoned, the male-female vocals are mellifluous, and the beats are chilled, with a woozy sunshine ambience that suits the trippy songs. Those songs are moved languidly along by looped samples of 70s and 80s soul, funk and jazz-funk. It's become something of a cliche to say it of new bands and their music, but these tunes sound not only accessible enough to be hits but also familiar enough to have already been hits.</p> <p>The three met at a dive arcade in Koreatown, LA, during which Eddington \"the California cowboy\" Howard held forth on his specialist subject, houseflies (they have titled a track Goldblum, after the bug-eyed thespian who played <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MDFan__QXg\" title=\"\">a movie insect</a>). Howard may be in the same bearded ballpark, looks-wise, as the demented rapper from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Orlbo9WkZ2E\" title=\"\">Death Grips</a>, but his sun-dazed meditations are at the opposite indolent extreme to Stefan Burnett's. His sister Miche \"the 100 Watt\" Maya is the one with the cool, jazzy voice that's a bit <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ9VBMBS3qE\" title=\"\">Neneh Cherry</a> and a bit <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/06/macy-gray-us-singer-and-actor?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Macy Gray</a>, but capable of high coos over lyrical haikus that are cutely infectious. That leaves Tulip \"Barth Grooks\" Pezely to handle the crisp, clear production, with its samples of rap staple <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SFt7JHwJeg\" title=\"\">Summer Madness</a> to show how in love they are with the old school.</p> <p>Interestingly, they describe themselves as a collective, with one Jimbo Stewart their \"muse\" (whatever that means) and Pablo Balderas in charge of videos. Howard also operates as one half of <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/theprjcts\" title=\"\">PRJCTS</a>, who are no slouches themselves when it comes to pop-hop or hip-pop: their track <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJJzxKLXadQ\" title=\"\">Standing in the Mirror</a> is luscious rap laced with vintage-style R&amp;B, reminiscent of Outkast. It fits superbly with Oddience's own songs. They have the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHtIifSBGEs\" title=\"\">Lit Lava Lamp</a> EP, including a track entitled Goldblum, which you'd swear had DangerMouse's impish grin on it while alluding atmos-wise to De La Soul's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3VT1ml6lxw\" title=\"\">D.A.I.S.Y.

Elsewhere, Yes Sir and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvbqBoHaT2g\" title=\"\">Smile</a> belie the fact that they are part of something called the Simple Bitch EP. They even have a 44-minute Summer Mix on their SoundCloud which features everyone from the brilliantly bonkers <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/apr/02/new-band-danny-brown\" title=\"\">Danny Brown</a> to what sounds like the none-more-celestial warble of Liz Fraser of Cocteau Twins, making her third appearance in this column this week.

  "<p>Ferraris and Swiss watches may be catnip to a certain class of wealthy Chinese consumer. But to the Communist party they are proving a headache, an uncomfortably blatant sign of the wealth some have amassed.</p> <p>There is no shortage of cases. In recent days one official, Yang Dacai, faced scrutiny online for obtaining watches worth tens of thousands of pounds on a salary estimated at about \u00a31,000 a month. That was followed by reports this week that the victim of a fatal Ferrari crash in March had been the son of one of President Hu Jintao's key allies.</p> <p>\"Cases like the Ferrari and Yang cases hurts the regime's legitimacy terribly,\" said Xiaobo Lu, an expert on corruption at Columbia University. \"The government has a huge challenge with the 'trust deficit'.\"</p> <p>At best, such images highlight the growing gulf between China's rich and poor, and the extent to which officials and their families appear to be aligned with the winners. This year sharp-eyed observers drew attention to the designer brands on parade at the annual session of the National People's Congress, the largely rubber-stamp parliament that includes numerous business tycoons, with some dubbing the event Beijing fashion week.</p> <p>At worst, they raise embarrassing questions about corruption and nepotism. \"I can't imagine that an official who is a fanatic when it comes to procuring luxury watches is serving the people wholeheartedly,\" Wang Wenyu, who sparked the Yang storm by posting pictures on Weibo, told the Global Times.</p> <p>Dali Yang, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, said consumption that could not be supported on official salaries, combined with behaviour that \"flaunts one's wealth or violates norms \u2026 chip at the credibility of the party, which tends to call for a more austere lifestyle, and undermine popular trust. And when such incidents are aired on the web, they can serve to galvanise public opinion.\"</p> <p>The party's provincial discipline inspection commission was investigating Yang Dacai's assets, an officer told the Global Times. Pictures posted online showed Yang wearing at least five different luxury watches, including, it was claimed, a Vacheron Constantin model worth between 200,000 and 400,000 yuan (\u00a320-40,000).</p> <p>Yang later said the most expensive was a Montblanc worth 35,000 yuan, and said he had bought the watches over the course of a decade using his legitimate income. Shortly after that interview, photos emerged of the Shanxi official wearing six more watches.</p> <p>A blogger using the name Huazong who has pioneered the tracking of expensive timepieces \u2013 evaluating the watches of more than 300 officials last year \u2013 said his work was \"not necessarily a good anti-corruption tool. It can't take the place of the government's anti-corruption organs.</p> <p>\"The key is to make officials' incomes public. Because all officials' incomes are kept in the dark, ordinary people can only guess. They will search about officials with luxury goods as a way to vent their pent-up emotions.\"</p> <p>He said the donning of luxury watches did not prove corruption, but did tell observers something else: \"Chinese officials are not elected, therefore they will not care about their public images.\"</p> <p>In a sign of the subject's sensitivity, Huazong's website was shut down and police summoned him to \"drink tea\", a euphemism for an intimidatory conversation.</p> <p>The government has sought to rein in spending by officials, with orders to eschew luxury cars and expensive banquets. An HSBC report on the luxury sector in China says: \"With challenging economic conditions, high-profile graft cases and rising social tension driven by China's growing wealth divide, there is a risk that corporate gifting may suffer as the government clamps down on conspicuous consumption and gets tough on corruption.\"</p> <p>Lu said the premier, Wen Jiabao, had promised to look into implementing a \"sunshine law\" requiring officials to declare their assets. \"One can only assume there is strong resistance to such tough transparency rules. But without it, people will remain cynical,\" he said.</p>",

  "<p>After disappointing results in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/copenhagen\" title=\"\">Copenhagen</a> (2010) and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/durban-climate-change-conference-2011\" title=\"\">Durban</a> (2011), the world awaited <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/rio-20-earth-summit\" title=\"\">Rio+20</a> with far less anticipation than we had for the Euro 2012 semi-finals, the successful crossing of Niagara Falls by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/16/nik-wallenda-niagara-tightrope-succeeds\" title=\"\">Nik Wallenda</a>, or the return of <a href=\"http://neverseconds.blogspot.com.es/\" title=\"\">lunch blogger Martha Payne</a>. Sustainable business, like all other business, has been riveted by the electoral politics of Greece and France and the more or less fictional pronouncements of G20 finance ministers. It was never likely that Rio+20 would change anything.</p> <p>We know that the international discourse about sustainability will not reverse decades of inaction, that governments will not likely guide us from economic and environmental disaster into a new world order of hope and quality of life. Our deep cynicism is well founded; we have seen too many pronouncements fail.</p> <p>Yet there is no human who does not prefer to live in hope. No business wants to discount its calculations of the net present value of future income streams by the absence of a future. No political leader wants to see the local impact of economic and environmental decline.</p> <p>How is it that time and again we are unable to achieve what so many of us want? Why can we not achieve an agenda which is likely the only way forward into prosperity?</p> <p>At the recent conference of the <a href=\"http://www.isnie.org/\" title=\"\">International Society of New Institutional Economists</a>, Shi-Ling Hsu presented a paper looking at why we cannot get the answer right. In <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCgQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fpapers.isnie.org%2Fpaper%2F877.html&amp;ei=C9pJUNPVJYTs0gWmiIDoDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFuFEb7wn2Ac3bX3khLnV27HaMVbg&amp;sig2=J04PsI31Qqmf2Q68oNHULg\" title=\"\">Physical, Human, and Social Capital as Barriers to Environmental Policy Change</a>, he theorises that \"environmentally harmful products and practices persist because firms and people have so much invested in their persistence\". We lock in unsustainable technologies and ways of life because capital is too expensive to write off without threatening the viability of a firm or a consumer. Oil companies and coal mine operators cannot afford to lose the value of their investments. State-owned enterprises are no less dependent on the value of carbon deposits than are for-profit companies.</p> <p>Fishing villages and logging towns around the world want to maintain their livelihoods which depend on the extraction of decreasingly available stocks. Families who are making large mortgage and loan payments on suburban homes and cars are not easily convinced to leave their commitments and reinvest in housing and transport with a smaller carbon footprint.</p> <p>Hsu suggests that we are locked into our carbon-hungry lives and our extractive livelihoods by specific and pervasive public policies which favour the creation and stability of capital. Grandfathering the use of old technology allows firms and their customers to get by with processes and equipment which are far worse than their replacements. Tax credits for extractive industries slow the movement of our economies into more sustainable industries. Capital gains taxes provide incentives to retain capital long past its \"best before date\" to avoid triggering tax penalties.</p> <p>Too often firms must retain their holdings in assets that unnecessarily deplete natural resources or burn carbon in order to maintain healthy balance sheets. They cannot easily invest in new capital when governments allow them generous tax concessions on outdated technology.</p> <p>We can better align incentives so that business will move out of the status quo and into more sustainable methods. Governments need not continue to support and subsidise outdated industries and processes. Instead, they might identify \"environmentally-stranded capital\" and let it be written down to zero over a relatively short period of time \u2013 if it is taken out of operation forever. If we really want companies to change, we must demand accelerated write-off schedules for investments in coal mines and trawlers.</p> <p>One way forward is through better accounting standards. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/jun/22/rio-20-summit-final-day-live-blog\" title=\"\">GDP+</a>, the UK environment minister's proposal to enter natural resources into a national chart of accounts, had the potential to resolve some of the tension between the desire of business to innovate and capital policies which lock us into old technology. When a nation assigns a value to its natural resources, it may be more likely to drop incentives which encourage resource depletion. Nick Clegg took the proposal to Rio. After appeals by Clegg and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/josephstiglitz\" title=\"\">Joseph Stiglitz</a>, the final text of the conference recognised the need for \"broader measures of progress to complement GDP\". It referred the problem to the <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/commission.htm\" title=\"\">UN Statistical Commission</a>.</p> <p>Until our various legislators and regulators reconsider their capital-related policies, we will have fewer financial incentives than we need. Until we stop being rewarded for maintaining old equipment, investments and industries, we have little reason to reinvest or to favour the substantive change which Rio+20 might have brought. Without fixing financial regulations and accounting schemes, we cannot easily fix the earth.</p> <p><em>Alison Kemper teaches management at York University and has worked with the Michael Lee-Chin Institute for Corporate Citizenship at the Rotman School since 2005.

  "<p>You couldn't pick a nicer day for the Greens' conference: stunningly sunny but somewhat unseasonably so, as if to simultaneously spur you to action and remind you to get a move on.</p> <p>Nor could you get a more advantageous spot than the Council House in Bristol, a grand building before a broad carpet of grass, in a city whose council was definitely the first and possibly still the only to provide residents with a nest of multi-coloured recycling bins so comprehensive that there's even a tiny one for batteries.</p> <p>But is this the right time? Has the Greens' time finally come, and what would that look like, if it had?</p> <p>By common agreement Caroline Lucas stepped down as leader this week and Natalie Bennett, late of the Guardian, has taken her place. Lucas made a convoluted remark about how she'd passed on the baton, which \"could not be in safer or more effective hands than those of Natalie Bennett\", but I put this slightly watery description (\"safe and effective\" \u2013 it's not what you'd want on your tombstone, is it?) down to a reluctance to gush.</p> <p>Elise Benjamin, who went to her first Green conference in 1988 and has just finished her term as Oxford's first Green lord mayor, describes Bennett more fully: \"Capable, knowledgeable, brilliant, encouraging, passionate.\"</p> <p>Outside the party, there are two main criticisms of Bennett. One is that she is too emollient, doesn't focus enough on attacking the coalition, concentrates instead on talking about her own policies.</p> <p>The other, coming from the Labour party, is that she's too aggressive; Bennett is \"sectarian and doctrinaire\", says Theo Blackwell, a Labour councillor, echoing voices across that party who find the Greens insufficiently supportive.</p> <p>It's the kind of criticism you'd level against a younger sibling \u2013 \"sectarian and doctrinaire\" is really just another way of saying \"they don't agree with us\". If the Labour party saw the Greens as a separate party, as I think they'll eventually have to, the fact that they sometimes disagree won't come as such a painful surprise.</p> <p>But of course, they're also right. Bennett is in no hurry to build a relationship with Labour. She spent a good part of her conference speech attacking Miliband, both for his form and for being a member of the government who, in her view, softened up the country for this poshocracy \u2013 politics that are \"failing to feed us\".</p> <p>Her ambitions are significant: \"In London, in May, we became the third largest party. I want to see us become the third largest party in the East Midlands, in Yorkshire and Humber, in Cornwall, all around the country.\"</p> <p>Later on, she described the Greens as the main opposition. \"It's a huge ask, but I believe we're already doing it.\"</p> <p>You'll find no naysayers at the conference, of course, because you never do. The faithful will only talk frankly to one another, which is fair enough, but that in itself is enough to make members of any party seem a bit cultish, set apart, an aneurysm in the bloodstream of life.</p> <p>\"Politics is such a minority interest, anybody involved in any party is seen as &#xa0;a bit of a loony,\" said 19-year-old Josiah Mortimer.</p> <p>With that caveat the Greens have never looked more credible, nor more confident in their own credibility.</p> <p>If I said that I didn't see any gluten-free food, or anyone eating salad out of a carrier bag, then I'd be lying. But the mainstream has moved greenwards over the years, even if its politics emphatically haven't.</p> <p>Mortimer tells me that young Greens are now more numerous than young Lib Dems, and Zain Sardar, 24, talks gleefully about what the political landscape will look like when the Liberal Democrats have been annihilated.</p> <p>I first saw Bennett speak publicly in a meeting about abortion. Beforehand I was thinking, that's funny, what's the Green party got to say about abortion?</p> <p>By the time they've got the deciding vote on a choice issue, the species will be reproducing, virtually, by email. It was clear from her speech that they were anticipating building their influence somewhat sooner than that, and the more I hear her speak, the more realistic I think that that might be so.</p> <p>Bennett, and probably the party as a whole, are still green in the other sense; they desperately need some sort of events training, so that, for instance, someone knows how to turn the microphone down, so that they don't all wear a green jacket against a green background (a producer from Channel 4 had to send someone out to Oxfam to find a lavender jacket). But it will take more than a dearth of colour sense to block this noticeable momentum.</p>",
  "<p>For the first 30 or so minutes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/07/barack-obama-pleads-voters-finish\">President Obama's convention closer</a>, there was an unwelcome guest in the room: the memory of other speeches. Since his election, Obama has necessarily leavened his speeches with policy specifics and gestures at compromise. His most universally-applauded remarks have been those given when everyone wants to be uplifted. His speech at the Democratic convention on Thursday was one of the first chances in a long while to get the positive attention of a national audience that would not come in the wake of a tragedy \u2013 though Republicans might argue differently.</p> <p>Given that context, the specificity and pragmatism of his speech's first two-thirds was disappointingly reminiscent of his state of the union addresses, not the fiery performances of the previous campaign. Long on numbers, short on heart, missing poetry and settling for facts. At the very end, however, Obama stirred. He raised his voice and his vision. The invisible Obama who had haunted both parties' halls finally showed up. Mostly, he did not have to remind us there was an election going on \u2013 until he announced, \"We face a choice.\" (Generous, that \"we\".)</p> <p>Obama clearly wants to appear like the bigger man when it comes to campaign tactics \u2013 he talks a lot about how politics has gotten \"small\" \u2013 but his jabs at Romney over a mischaracterization of Russia's importance and Romney's foreign gaffe-a-looza were as close to an adolescent eyeroll as a president can get without being on Twitter. (Hashtag: #facepalm.) That short, snarky interlude was the only part to bear a recognizable resemblance to the campaign the parties will spring onto mostly unsuspecting Americans in a matter of days. Or sooner: within hours of Obama's speech ending, the Romney campaign announced a $4.5m ad buy, consisting of 15 separate ads, to run in eight swing states.</p> <p>And I'll give the Republicans this: their convention, while not representative in terms of national demographics, or even verifiable reality, very much reflected the direction of the campaign we'll see in the fall. Romney will not be so much running for the presidency as gunning for it, taking it on as a position to be attacked and occupied. Pundits talked about his convention speech being his introduction to American voters, but it was really a list of grievances. He mentioned Obama by name 15 times \u2013 as many times as he mentioned \"jobs\". And you know how much he likes eliminating jobs.</p> <p>Obama never mentioned Romney by name \u2013 he was merely the nameless and, by implication, unworthy \"opponent\". The entire convention, from the speeches inside to the vendors outside, treated Romney as an amusing afterthought. He was represented by a Cheshire Cat smirk.</p> <p>But a presidential race can't be run by <em>two</em> invisible men. In each case, convention-goers celebrated their candidate more than they denigrated the other guy, but then again, they have already made up their minds \u2013 though one might argue that Republican convention-goers still had to be convinced. Beyond Tampa and Charlotte and in the public arena, however, the Democratic argument will be almost indistinguishable from the one Republicans made more explicitly: <em>not the other guy!</em></p> <p>Forget this week's Charlotte love-in and look at the rhetorical record of campaign ads. Obama and his Super Pac have hammered Romney on his taxes, his relationship to the far right, his business background and his singing. They aren't just defining Romney, they're demolishing him. That many of the attacks have, at least, some more direct relationship to facts than a typical Paul Ryan speech is important, but does not elevate their tone. </p> <p>On Fox News shortly after Obama wrapped up, Karl Rove summed up the Obama campaign's approach:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You create a false image of who you're running against and then smash it down.</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, he would know. Going after your opponent's purported greatest strength \u2013 in Romney's case, his business experience \u2013 is Rovian Strategy 101. This year's Obama campaign looks a lot more like one Rove would run than it does like \"hope\".</p> <p>With both parties shouting \"<em>not him</em>\" in the ears of voters, it's no wonder that many are worried turnout will dip not just below the last cycle's record high, but down to a record low. A contest between two effective arguments against the other guy can only end up with voters agreeing all around.</p> <p>If either candidate has a chance at raising the tone of this election, it's Obama. He's the only one who has done it in the past. I don't question that he wants to. But I think he wants even more just to win.</p>",
  "<p>The Hollywood film-maker <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/09/10/120910fa_fact_hemon#ixzz25WxpxIOt\" title=\"\">Lana Wachowski has described how she publicly came out as transgender</a> while shooting the Matrix sequels with her brother Andy. \"My biggest fears were all about losing my family,\" Lana (formerly Larry) told the New Yorker magazine. \"Once they accepted me, everything else was a piece of cake.\"</p> <p>Having previously shunned interview requests, Wachowski opened up about her history of gender confusion as the siblings prepared to premiere their latest film \u2013 an adaptation of David Mitchell's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780340822784/cloud-atlas\" title=\"\">Cloud Atlas </a> \u2013 at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/toronto-film-festival-2012\" title=\"\">Toronto film festival</a>. She recalled that, while at school, she was often unsure whether to join the boys' line or the girls' and wound up standing between the two. \"Some part of me figured I was exactly where I belonged,\" Wachowski, 47, told the interviewer, Bosnian-American novelist Aleksandar Hemon. \"Betwixt.\"</p> <p>The Wachowskis made their feature debut with the 1996 thriller Bound before scoring a global success with the 1999 science-fiction blockbuster <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/77528/matrix\" title=\"\">The Matrix</a>. But it was during production on the Matrix sequels, on set in Australia during 2002, that Lana began to struggle. \"For years I couldn't even say the words 'transgender' or 'transexual',\" she said. \"When I began to admit it to myself, I knew I would eventually have to tell my parents and my brother and my sisters. This fact would inject such terror into me that I would not sleep for days.\"</p> <p>Wachowski says that he finally told his mother, \"I'm transgender. I'm a girl\" and has lived as Lana ever since. For his part, brother Andy has said that Lana is \"easier to work with\" than Larry was.</p>",
  "<p>The announcement by Nato and US forces that they would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/02/us-suspends-training-afghan-police?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">suspend the training of new recruits</a> and re-vet all 16,300 members of the Afghan Local Police (ALP) force was long overdue. Sadly, the decision was only made after an alarming escalation of so-called \"green on blue\" attacks, in which Nato forces were killed by their ostensible Afghan allies. This year alone, 45 foreign soldiers have died in more than 30 \"green-on-blue\" attacks, at least 15 in August alone.</p> <p>While it is understandable that Nato and the US have taken urgent steps to protect their own soldiers, it is shocking that ALP members and recruits have not been thoroughly vetted before. As Human Rights Watch and others <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/node/101507\" title=\"\">have reported</a> over the past two years \u2013 long before the recent spate of green on blue attacks \u2013 the ALP has repeatedly been involved in serious abuses against Afghan civilians. But the killings, rape, and extortion of Afghan civilians evidently was not reason enough for a rethink.</p> <p>The ALP was <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/19/world/la-fg-village-police-20101020\" title=\"\">created in 2010 at the request of Gen David Petraeus</a>, the former commander of international forces in Afghanistan and now the director of the CIA. The ALP is a loose network of local defence forces designed to mobilise and arm local civilians to defend their communities from the Taliban in areas where the national police and army have a limited presence. ALP recruits are mentored by foreign troops, most frequently US special forces, but in some parts of the country by troops from other nations, including Britain. They are nominally under the supervision of the Afghanistan National Police, but in practice they are sometimes no more than deputised gunmen loyal to a local warlord or members of violent local militias who are given a new uniform.</p> <p>While ALP units have been credited with improving security in some locations, there were warning signs about the programme from the beginning. Afghanistan has a long history of local control by armed groups. Not only have these groups frequently preyed on the local population and contributed to ethnic violence, they have too often spun beyond the control of those who established and supported them. The ALP from the beginning risked being yet another militia in which armed men were essentially set loose under the colour of law on local communities.</p> <p>Human rights organisations identified structural problems with the ALP early on, including a system of vetting easily defeated by local warlords, a command and control structure undermined by the limited capacity of the Afghanistan National Police, and virtually no effective means for accountability when abuses are committed by ALP members.</p> <p>As the programme was implemented, reports of abuses against Afghan civilians began to pile up. In a <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/reports/2011/09/12/just-don-t-call-it-militia\" title=\"\">September 2011 report</a>, Human Rights Watch documented extortion, illegal raids and detention, theft, assault, rape, and murder by the ALP. Since then, the abuses have continued, including the May 2012 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/02/world/asia/afghan-rape-case-is-a-challenge-for-the-government.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">alleged rape</a> of a teenage girl in northern Kunduz province by ALP members.</p> <p>For the US and Nato, with plans to expand the force to 30,000 by the end of 2014, the ALP is a cornerstone of the handover of Afghanistan's security to Afghan forces. It has become an integral part of the international withdrawal strategy, which is one reason why the US and Nato have mostly dismissed concerns raised by human rights groups about the ALP, claiming that abuses were committed by other armed groups or were aberrations that were dealt with.</p> <p>One exception was a US military investigation triggered by the Human Rights Watch report. The investigation, concluded in December 2011, largely confirmed the contents of the Human Rights Watch report, including a need for better understanding of local context and ethnic dynamics, deficits in training, and a lack of procedures to fire or discipline abusive ALP members. Unofficially, many US and UK officers have expressed serious concern about the way the ALP was set up and how it may become an uncontrolled monster unless it is quickly brought under proper command and control.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the new measures announced by Nato to reform the ALP \u2013 including increased counter-intelligence, new systems for detecting \"insider threats\", establishment of anonymous reporting, and enhanced cultural training \u2013 are focused solely on containing the threat that the ALP and other Afghan security forces present to foreign troops working alongside them, not improving the way that ALP members treat Afghans.</p> <p>Earlier attention by Nato and the US to the ALP abuse of civilians might have not only better protected civilians but also prevented some \"green on blue\" attacks. The same measures human rights activists have been recommending \u2013 better vetting, more comprehensive training, a fully functional command structure, and real accountability mechanisms to discipline, dismiss and prosecute those responsible for abuse \u2013 might have screened out or expelled ALP members at risk of turning on their international partners.</p> <p>Now that Nato and the US have taken on the difficult but essential task it is time to go further and engage in wholesale reform of an institution that poses a serious threat, not just to foreign troops but also to Afghan civilians. Any overhaul of the programme should value protection of civilians just as highly as protection of Nato soldiers.</p>",
  "<p>It was with the publication of her feminist polemic Patriarchal Attitudes in 1970 \u2013 the same year Germaine Greer's The Female Eunuch and Kate Millett's Sexual Politics came out \u2013 that Eva Figes's name sprang to prominence. Emphasising various aspects of women's oppression, Eva insisted that it is nurture rather than nature that has shaped secondary sex characteristics. Since women have had little to say in defining norms, the discussion centres on influential male thinkers, ranging from the writers of the Bible to Sigmund Freud. Most controversially, perhaps, she saw marriage as an anachronistic institution, perpetuating anachronistic attitudes. She herself was by then divorced, though she kept her husband's name throughout her life.</p> <p>Patriarchal Attitudes remains her best known work and has had a huge influence on succeeding generations of women trying to find themselves. However, it was with her groundbreaking experimental novels, in which inner and outer aspects of life are woven into a luminous tapestry, that Eva, who has died aged 80, made her most significant contribution to 20th-century writing.</p> <p>A year after she won the Guardian fiction prize for her second novel, Winter Journey (1967), in which she describes the last days of an old man, Janus, for whom \"eternity splits into a second\", she wrote in the Guardian: \"People talk about writing for 'posterity' when work is not read or understood by more than a few. But posterity must and will take care of itself ... when I am at work I feel really aware of the present, of being alive here and now, of trying to apprehend existence, in however inadequate a fashion.\" Her own favourite was Light (1983), a short novel about a day in the life of Claude Monet. She felt if she were remembered for nothing else, that would do.</p> <p>Eva was born in Berlin to prosperous secular Jewish parents, Peter and Irma Unger. During Kristallnacht in November 1938, her father was arrested and sent to Dachau concentration camp. After his release, he managed to escape to Britain in March 1939 with his wife and two children, Eva and her younger brother, Ernst. Seven-year-old Eva was bewildered by the change from a life of affluence to one of poverty in London. At her primary school, she felt conspicuously foreign, left out, labelled a \"Jerry\" after the outbreak of war. But by the time she got to Kingsbury grammar school, an avid reader with fluent English, she found approval and appreciation of her linguistic gifts.</p> <p>Life at home was difficult: her father was in the army; her mother working, with little time for her daughter. \"One afternoon just before the war ended,\" Eva wrote in the Observer in 1979, \"my mother gave me nine pence and sent me off to the local cinema ... I sat alone in the dark and watched the newsreel of Belsen \u2026\" It was a deeply shocking experience which haunted her in nightmares for years. The seeds were sown for her third novel, Konek Landing (1969), about a Holocaust survivor who cannot come to terms with the present.</p> <p>In 1953 she graduated from Queen Mary College, University of London, with a BA honours degree in English. She left determined to become a writer. In 1988 her old college, by then Queen Mary and Westfield, made her a fellow.</p> <p>In 1955 she married John Figes. They had two children, Kate and Orlando, both now distinguished writers. The marriage was dissolved in 1962 and Eva brought up the children on her own, as well as writing and working for various publishers. She met G\u00fcnter Grass when he was visiting London. Their short affair turned into a lasting friendship \u2013 one of his drawings, which hung in her sitting room, was a treasured possession. In May this year, she went to Germany with Orlando to visit Grass in L\u00fcbeck. Their affection for each other was undimmed.</p> <p>Eva and I first met in London in the 1960s, taking part in a reading at Better Books organised by the publisher John Calder. Our friendship had its ups and downs over the decades. Eva was a driven person, impatient, whether waiting at a bus stop or for a call from her agent \u2013 or indeed for anything that was not happening quickly enough. In public and private, she inveighed against the stupidities of national and international politicians in general and the shortcomings of NHS hospitals in particular, of which she had an uncomfortable number of experiences.</p> <p>\"Hello, this is the other one\" is how we would greet each other on the telephone, in tacit acknowledgment of our common background in Berlin, where countless parents during the 1920s and 1930s had called their daughters Eva. Altogether, over the years, her ambivalent attitude towards Germany had eased into a sense of feeling at home when she visited Berlin, by herself or with her family.</p> <p>Her anger had become focused on Israel, where she had been only once, briefly. Her last published book, Journey to Nowhere (2008), begins with an account of the Unger family servant Edith, who had stayed in Berlin but eventually made her way to Israel, where she was miserable. Though one woman's failure to find happiness is scarcely an indictment of a whole country, the remainder of the book turns into a fierce anti-Israeli polemic. \"I have always thought the creation of Israel was a catastrophic mistake, perhaps the worst of the 20th century. I have also, always, had doubts about Israel's right to exist.\"</p> <p>In an acme of fury, she called German Jews who went to Palestine in the 1930s \"Hitler Zionists\". The strident, unbalanced tone of voice of Journey to Nowhere does not do Eva justice.</p> <p>She was at her best in the previous book, Tales of Innocence and Experience (2003), exploring the bond between grandmother and granddaughter. Intertwined are the narrator's recollection of the fairytales she tells which take her back to her own childhood. Eva always spoke of her four granddaughters with enormous pride and deep affection, and her often strained features would become suffused with a glow. That is how I shall remember her.</p> <p>She is survived by Kate, Orlando and her granddaughters.</p> <p>\u2022 Eva Figes, writer, born 15 April 1932; died 28 August 2012</p>",
  "<p>It's time for this week's roundup of the best new iPhone and iPad apps, based on a mixture of App Store trawling, press releases and developer submissions.</p> <p>Games aren't included \u2013&#xa0;you can find the latest multi-platform mobile games roundup <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2012/sep/06/best-mobile-games-avengers-horn\">here</a> \u2013&#xa0;and PLEASE before posting an angry comment about The Guardian's dreadful Apple bias, check out the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/sep/07/best-android-apps-pizzaexpress-viame\">20 Best Android apps</a> piece that was posted earlier.</p> <p>Here's this week's iOS selection:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/slideshark-view-share-presentations/id471369684?mt=8\">SlideShark</a></h2> <p>Already available on iPad, useful presentation-viewing app SlideShark is now available for the iPhone too. The service includes cloud storage for PowerPoint presentations, which can then be downloaded and viewed with the app, and shared with others.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/housemate/id514410118?mt=8\">HouseMate</a></h2> <p>This app is the work of Shelter Scotland, aiming to help tenants avoid arguments with their landlords over deposit repayments. The idea: the app creates a digital inventory of your rented house's contents, which can be shared between tenant and landlord, complete with photos.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/appnet-rhino/id554821337?mt=8\">AppNet Rhino</a></h2> <p>These are still early days for Twitter-alternative App.net, but the first mobile apps from third-party developers are beginning to appear. First to the App Store is AppNet Rhino, which makes a start on putting the real-time social feed on a smartphone with streams, posting and profiles.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/app/barbie-princess-popstar/id553201364\">Barbie: Princess and Popstar</a></h2> <p>At the time of writing, this is only available in the US. It's a book-app by Random House Digital based on the latest Barbie DVD. Expect a 20-page story, karaoke songs, digital stickers and slide puzzles.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/flicklist/id555437109?mt=8\">Flicklist</a></h2> <p>There are apps to watch films on an iPhone or iPad, but Flicklist is an app to help discover them. Invite-only for now \u2013&#xa0;although invites are <a href=\"http://flicklist.com\">requestable</a> on the developer's website \u2013&#xa0;it's based around curated lists of films and social networking to get the recommendations of friends and strangers alike.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/swarmly/id534570775?mt=8\">Swarmly</a></h2> <p>The logical next step on from social location apps like Foursquare, Swarmly aggregates social activity from real-world venues and displays them on a map, to show where's hot right now among social apps users. And if the idea of people nose-deep in their smartphones when out for the night enrages you, think of it this way: Swarmly will show you which venues to <em>avoid</em>...<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/yogiplay-parent-center-best/id521035807?mt=8\">YogiPlay Parent Center</a></h2> <p>US startup YogiPlay is one of the companies trying to help parents discover good educational and/or entertainment apps for their children. Like a Game Center for kids, a bit, except with the connectivity going between parents and children, rather than children and children. Anyway, this is its central app, showing parents how their kids have been using any YogiPlay-enabled apps, as well as recommending others.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gtar/id438739702?mt=8\">gTar</a></h2> <p>Startup Incident Technologies raised $350k on Kickstarter earlier this year for its educational guitar named gTar. It's a guitar with a dock for an iPhone running the gTar app, which was released this week. The app helps players learn songs, and also functions as the sound-generator for the guitar itself. US-only for now, as that's where early shipments of the gTar itself are going.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/magic-belles-magic-music/id542244069?mt=8\">Magic Belles: Magic Music</a></h2> <p>This is another new app aimed at girls, featuring characters created by British firm Luma Creative that already exist on the Magic Belles website. The app itself stars six of the fairies with musical mini-games, with flowers and rainbows high in the mix. <br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/instatable-timetable-homework/id552753600?mt=8\">InstaTable</a></h2> <p>This may be a good back-to-school app for children with their own iPod touch devices (or iPhones, obviously). It's a timetable and homework-planning app with lots of customisation options, to help students quickly input all their classes and tasks, reviewing them as they are completed.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/feedflow/id540957003?mt=8\">Feedflow</a></h2> <p>This weekly post would be stranded without NewsRack, the excellent RSS reader that I use to scan new App Store apps via Google Reader. Feedflow is a stylish-looking alternative, though: logging in to a Google Reader account, downloading articles for offline reading. It also supports sharing on Twitter, Pocket and Readability.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/indie-shuffle/id553538222?mt=8\">Indie Shuffle</a></h2> <p>Another week, another crop of apps trying to solve the music discoverability problem \u2013&#xa0;finding good new songs amid millions of digitally-available tracks. Based on the Indie Shuffle website, this provides playlists in multiple genres, with songs able to be favourited to create your own.<br><strong>iPhone</strong> </p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/john-cage-piano/id553864918?mt=8\">John Cage Piano</a></h2> <p>Released to celebrate what would have been composer John Cage's 100th birthday, this iPad app is a digital version of Cage's \"prepared piano\", which (as the App Store description notes \u2013&#xa0;I'm not a Cage buff) involved placing objects \"beneath and between the strings of a grand piano to create an entirely new instrument\". The sounds have been \"meticulously sampled\" \u2013&#xa0;great for playing your own avant-garde masterpiece. Or just making a racket.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/gojee-food-drinks-recipes/id508115822?mt=8\">Gojee</a></h2> <p>Also featured in our Android roundup this week, Gojee aggregates recipes for food and drinks from a range of foody blogs \u2013 more than 200, it claims \u2013 presenting them in a neat design with lots of photographs to help you choose something appetising to make.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bluebadgestyle/id551553781?mt=8\">Blue Badge Style</a></h2> <p>And another dual iOS/Android release for this app, which recommends bars, restaurants and clubs nearby, with reviews. Which may sound like an app genre that's been done to death on iOS \u2013&#xa0;because it has \u2013&#xa0;but the twist here is that Blue Badge Style is also focused on accessibility, showing which venues are friendliest for disabled visitors.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/starmatic/id550167107?mt=8\">Starmatic</a></h2> <p>How much room is there for new photo-sharing apps? Instagram may have gathered 50m users and finally sealed its Facebook deal, but there are plenty of startups jostling to bring something new to the SoPho* genre. Starmatic is the latest: a well-designed app based on the Brownie Starmatic camera, with filters, social sharing and some very nice work on its user interface.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/dms-ft-aggy/id551989363?mt=8\">DM's ft. Aggy</a></h2> <p>There has been a spate of fashion-related apps on iOS in the last month, although not all of them have been as impressive as the clothing they feature. Shoe-brand Dr. Martens has made more of an effort with its new iPhone app though, roping in model Agyness Deyn to show off her own collection. It accompanies the firm's latest line of footwear.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/how-my-body-works/id531654658?mt=8\">How My Body Works</a></h2> <p>Publisher De Agostini has put together this anatomical book-app, providing two 3D models of the human body \u2013&#xa0;male and female \u2013&#xa0;and splitting its explanations, illustrations and mini-games into eight \"packs\" which can be bought individually or en masse using in-app purchases. It's aimed at younger iOS users.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/weathercube-revolutionary/id555306679?mt=8\">Weathercube</a></h2> <p>At first glance, this is the latest app to take inspiration from the no-buttons interface of to-do-lists app Clear, although Weathercube has a different focus \u2013&#xa0;weather forecasts \u2013&#xa0;and does some different things through its cube-like structure. \"It's the weather \u2013 in a cube \u2013&#xa0;awesome!\" reckon the developers.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/mixer/id552385834?mt=8\">Mixer</a></h2> <p>One more social location app to talk about this week: \"a social mixer for your location\". Nothing to do with cocktails. It's about finding interesting people nearby, which a lot of apps have been trying to do, without much hard evidence of a demand for this. Even so, Mixer has some interesting touches with its focus on neighbourhoods that could help it catch on.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <p><em>*You will never see the SoPho abbreviation used on the Apps Blog again. That's a promise.</em></p>",

Click here to view</a></p> <p>The popular mashup movie style is just a continuation of the trend towards fan-fuelled, B-moviesque, exploitation-inspired material epitomised by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/samuel-l-jackson\" title=\"\">Samuel L Jackson</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/113997/snakes.on.a.plane\" title=\"\">Snakes on a Plane</a> bellyflop a few years back. The same tendency was also partly responsible for the likes of the rather fun <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141005/hobo-with-a-shotgun\" title=\"\">Hobo with a Shotgun</a>, starring Rutger Hauer, and the misfiring Nazis-in-space film <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146523/iron-sky\" title=\"\">Iron Sky</a>. I suppose we also have <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/quentintarantino\" title=\"\">Quentin Tarantino</a> and Robert Rodriguez to blame for reviving a genre that, almost entirely dependent on a preposterous premise for its creative energy, often tends to run out of gas half an hour in.</p> <p>Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, the first trailer for which has hit the web, arrives in the wake of the rather underwhelming Seth Grahame-Smith-scripted <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147852/abraham-lincoln\" title=\"\">Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter</a> earlier this year. The title tells you everything you need to know about the storyline: after escaping the evil crone who wanted to munch on their tender bones in the Brothers Grimm fairytale, the siblings have matured into badass exterminators of evil hags everywhere. Portrayed by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/gemma-arterton\" title=\"\">Gemma Arterton</a> and Jeremy Renner, they seem to have walked into the middle of a particularly bad episode of the A-Team set in medieval central Europe.</p> <p>Gretel may once have been an innocent little cutie with a dangerous penchant for sweet-tasting fancies, but now she's an awesome, bodacious warrior babe with a big gun. Her habits include headbutting annoying people who try to do non-awesome stuff such as talking and saying things like: \"You gotta be kidding me\" at opportune moments when all hell is about to break loose.</p> <p>Hansel speaks only in action movie lingo: \"Well that's new\", he mutters as someone pulls out a giant piece of artillery \u2013 and you'd have to say he's not wrong, given that the Gatling gun wasn't invented until 1861 and the Grimms probably based their tale on a story with origins in the 14th century.</p> <p>Norwegian director Tommy Wirkola, who made the generic but entertaining <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2009/feb/02/nazi-dead-snow-sundance\" title=\"\">2009 Nazi zombie horror Dead Snow</a>, is in charge here, freewheeling furiously from a screenplay by DW Harper. The production design looks pretty nifty, though the witches appear to have been swiped directly from Henry Selick's rather more interesting <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/128447/coraline\" title=\"\">Coraline</a>.</p> <p>What's a little surprising, a few years after people began to talk about mashup movies, is that the proposed film adaptation that got everyone excited about the genre in the first place \u2013 the one based on Grahame-Smith's bestselling Pride and Prejudice and Zombies novel \u2013 still doesn't seem to be any closer to entering production after going through three directors in as many years. Whether that's because Abraham Lincoln performed only reasonably well at the box office ($90m from a $60m budget is not disastrous) is anyone's guess, but if one of these movies isn't a sizeable hit in the near future don't be surprised if the entire genre finds itself consigned to history as a weird early 21st-century blip on the cinematic landscape.</p> <p>I'm not sure that would be such a terrible thing. While the mashup movie has in many ways reinvigorated the sort of pleasingly throwaway grindhousey tropes last popular in the mid-1980s, it is essentially based on the same corporate-fuelled mantra that gave us <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/118377/transformers\" title=\"\">Transformers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146760/battleship\" title=\"\">Battleship</a>. Take an established \"brand\" \u2013 here an iconic historical figure or a well-known fairytale \u2013 and try to revive it in a style that is popular with cinema audiences (in this case balls-to-the-wall, brainless action with a side order of supernatural intrigue). Give me genuinely original fantasy horror, such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/sam-raimi\" title=\"\">Sam Raimi</a>'s criminally underrated, brutally silly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/129753/drag-me-to-hell\" title=\"\">Drag Me to Hell</a>, or (for the braver among us) <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/ben-wheatley\" title=\"\">Ben Wheatley</a>'s bewildering, ultra-sadistic <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/140926/kill-list\" title=\"\">Kill List</a> any day.</p> <p>In the meantime, gird your loins for more celluloid fantasy silliness: perhaps a prequel to Joe Carnahan's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145512/grey\" title=\"\">The Grey</a> titled The Three Little Pigs: Wolf Killers, or the epic action adventure: Thumbelina: Tiny but Deadly. Anyone else got any bright ideas for Hollywood to swipe?</p>",
  "<p>A pile of dead dogs appears on a poster, prominently displayed behind the desk of Gavin Grant, chief executive of the RSPCA. A famous example of his work 20 years ago, when he was the charity's campaigns director, it appeared in adverts protesting against the end of the dog licence and was so shocking, he claims, as to earn him a life ban from Crufts.</p> <p>When Grant's indignation is aroused, he can make his point in a most effective manner, rousing similar anger in others, which is not terribly good news for the British Horseracing Authority, since much of Grant's attention is now focused on racing and the Grand National in particular. The BHA will shortly reveal how it intends to respond to the deaths of two horses in this year's race and that response will determine whether the BHA has Grant's support or his enmity, which could result in disastrous publicity for the sport.</p> <p>\"The Grand National cannot afford another day like this year,\" he said this week in his office at the RSPCA's Horsham headquarters. \"It cannot afford to see animals dying and destroyed as a result of refusal to accept changes that make sense. The reputation of the Grand National is on the line.\"</p> <p>Reputation was Grant's major concern in the years before he rejoined the RSPCA in January, when he was the UK chairman of the public relations firm Burson-Marsteller. \"If the BHA was my client, what would I be saying to them? What I know is, when organisations come under pressure too often, they close themselves off and they close their ears. They talk amongst themselves and persuade themselves that they are right and the world is wrong. Whatever the truth of that, it's a very dangerous place to be.\"</p> <p>The BHA has not yet closed itself off to Grant. Instead, he will meet with Paul Bittar, its chief executive, and other officials at Sandown on 19 September, when he will be briefed as to the action they will take over the National. It is expected there will be some change to the starting procedure but little in the way of dramatic action beyond that.</p> <p>Grant is most unlikely to be granted the seven wishes he made shortly after this year's race, including the removal of Becher's Brook, which he described as \"a killer fence\", the levelling of all drop landings and a reduction in the number of runners. The strength of his views and his language shocked many within the sport, which has long relied on the RSPCA's tepid support as a buffer against attacks by animal rights groups such as Animal Aid.</p> <p>\"I make no apology for the stance I took,\" Grant says now in his first racing-related interview. \"I very much hope I don't have to take it again. My language would be different to that of my predecessors, perhaps, because I tell it the way it is. Perhaps other people might have pulled their punches in the past, but I don't.\"</p> <p>Under his leadership, he promises, the RSPCA will be much more involved at \"iconic\" events where animal welfare is an issue and he describes a step-change in \"our level of engagement at Aintree\" this year, when he had an inspector at every other fence around the National course.</p> <p>That \"made a very material difference to our knowledge and our insight as to what occurred and \u2026 gave us a greater capacity to speak out at that time.\" It may concern the sport's faithful to learn that Grant has met, once, with representatives of Animal Aid to discuss the National. \"I understand where Animal Aid are coming from. We are different.</p> <p>\"The RSPCA as an organisation takes the same view I do, of principled pragmatism. We deal with the world as it is and we seek to make change to the benefit of the animals. Sometimes, there is a need for other organisations who make a lot of noise and sometimes that persuades people to pay greater attention to those who make less noise.\"</p> <p>In contrast to the language he used in April, Grant's conversation is measured, reflective and respectful of other views. His manner is of the reasonable, experienced businessman approaching a difficult issue with a measure of patience. Yet the threat represented by those dead dogs hangs in the background.</p> <p>\"I don't want to see the end of the Grand National. I am that little boy who put his sixpence on Team Spirit [the 1964 winner]. I do watch this race.</p> <p>\"But, like many other people, long before I took this job, I'd become more and more disturbed by it and by the death of the horses in it. The magic of the Grand National had become tainted for me and the events of earlier this year certainly did that. I don't want to see that again.\"</p>",
  "<p>Russia faces a tense battle for the gold medals while England tries to recover from late defeats when the final round of the 150-nation chess Olympiad is played in Istanbul on Sunday. All the games are viewable, live and free on the internet, starting 11am BST (chessolympiadistanbul.com).</p> <p>The No1 seeds have not won the biennial Olympiad since 2002, so the team's grandmasters had to attend a pre-Olympiad training camp with \"bruising\" fitness sessions, while the legendary Yuri Dokhoian, who helped Garry Kasparov, was hired as coach.</p> <p>After eight of the 11 rounds Russia led with 15/16, two points clear, after the ex-world champion Vlad Kramnik scored a key win over Armenia's world No2, Levon Aronian.</p> <p>Kramnik opened as White with the Exchange Slav, seemingly too quiet for a must-win game but an old favourite of the Soviet chess patriarch Mikhail Botvinnik, who taught the young Kramnik at his school 20 years ago. Aronian thought he could draw easily by exchanging queens and rooks on the only open file, but he missed Kramnik's knight sacrifice which created a passed pawn which powered through to queen.</p> <p>But in Thursday's ninth round Russia crashed 1.5-2.5 to the United States, and with two rounds left both teams shared the lead with Armenia and China. China had the best tie-break and also had favourable positions after three hours of their key tenth round match with the US.</p> <p>England's Olympiad plan was for UK No1 Michael Adams and British champion Gawain Jones to hold down the top boards while Nigel Short scored against weaker opponents on board three. But rounds eight and nine brought disaster, 1-3 defeats to much lower rated opponents from Philippines and Vietnam, so that England now have little chance of a top 10 place.</p> <p><strong>3270</strong> 1...Bxg5 2 Qxg5 Rh2+! 3 Kf1 (if 3 Kxh2 Nf3+ wins the queen) Qh7! and White resigned.

  "<p>Phumelele Gura survived a barrage of police bullets and more than two weeks in prison, where he lay awake listening to the sound of workmates allegedly being tortured. His grandfather and his father backed the ANC. He no longer will.</p> <p>\"I won't vote for the ANC next time because they failed the people,\" he said. \"My family always voted ANC but we don't trust it any more.\"</p> <p>Gura, 49, is not alone in thinking the events of 16 August 2012 marked a tectonic shift in South Africa. That was the day when police, enforcing the will of the country's black-majority government, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/17/south-african-police-shot-miners?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">opened fire on striking miners, killing 34 and injuring 78</a>.</p> <p>The massacre represented \"probably the lowest moment in the short history of a democratic South Africa\", wrote Cyril Ramaphosa, a senior figure in the African National Congress and a former mining union leader.</p> <p>Comparisons were made with the bloodiest days of apartheid: Sharpeville, Soweto, now Marikana.</p> <p>Three weeks on, the strike persists and the dust has not settled. But it is increasingly apparent that this tragedy has <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2012-08-31-00-difficult-and-dangerous-times-ahead-for-the-anc\" title=\"\">shaken faith in the ANC and its union allies as never before</a>; that it has focused scrutiny on the exploitative 140-year relationship between foreign capital and black labour and led some to speculate that the tinderbox of South African inequality is just a spark away from conflagration.</p> <p>Mining has powered the South African economy, and warped its society, since the arrival of the empire builder Cecil Rhodes. Like many of the millions who burrowed underground to extract diamonds, gold and other minerals, Gura came a long way from home in search of a working wage. He found it as a rock driller at the Marikana platinum mine, owned by the British-based company Lonmin.</p> <p>\"It's hard work and sometimes you drill the rock and a rock falls down on you,\" he reflected. \"That's what we're afraid of.</p> <p>\"We spend eight hours underground. It's very hot and you can't see daylight. There is no air sometimes and you have to get air from the pipes down there.\"</p> <p>Gura said he lived in a tin shack with a pit toilet and intermittent electricity and water. He earned about 5,000 rand (\u00a3380) a month and, like many workers here, sent a portion home to his family in Eastern Cape province. He ran for his life when the shooting began on 16 August, but was arrested and jailed. \"From my cell I could hear the police beating my brothers, telling them to speak what they want.\"</p> <h2><strong>Betrayed</strong></h2> <p>His partner, Primrose Magwangqana, 45, was afraid she would never see him again. \"I thought he was dead,\" she recalled. \"They said to some people, 'your husband is in prison', but later they found out he was in the mortuary.\"</p> <p>She too feels betrayed by the party she supported all her life. \"I am an ANC member but I won't vote for them next time because they failed us. Only [the expelled youth leader] Julius Malema helped us.\"</p> <p>Striking mineworkers interviewed by the Guardian in Marikana this week echoed the sentiment. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/08/south-africa-anc-centenary\" title=\"\">ANC, the party of Nelson Mandela, which liberated black South Africans and is celebrating its centenary year</a>, can no longer take their support for granted.</p> <p>Samkele Mpampani, 36, a ringleader who marched on another Lonmin mineshaft this week, said: \"I won't vote ANC. They have killed our workers. I don't recognise the ANC any more. Jacob Zuma must step down. It's over now. It's over.\"</p> <p>The ANC was already bleeding electoral support before Marikana and sinking into factionalism. The party is accused of enriching a tiny black elite while failing to bring decent education, healthcare and jobs to the poor.</p> <p>Once a courageous anti-apartheid warrior, Ramaphosa now sits on the board of Lonmin and, it was recently reported, <a href=\"http://www.citypress.co.za/SouthAfrica/News/Buffalo-soldier-Cyril-loses-out-20120414\" title=\"\">can afford to bid up to R19.5m (\u00a31,480,000) for a prize buffalo</a>.</p> <p>Protests over poor service delivery have been swelling for years, sometimes fatally, but the scale of Marikana looks like a watershed.</p> <p>Allister Sparks, a veteran journalist and analyst, said: \"It is a cataclysm. Black people saw the police of the black ANC government shooting their own workers. It's shattered the deep-seated trust of the ANC as 'our party', the party you're born into, the party your fathers belonged to.</p> <p>\"The ANC was in the black mind, the black soul, it took on an almost mystical quality. But now they've lost faith in it. The bond is shattered and it happened on television.\"</p> <p>The unwritten, almost Faustian, pact made by the ANC at the end of apartheid is creaking under the weight of curdled promises. It set up the ANC's union allies to deliver modestly higher wages for workers while also ensuring labour stability for big business. It saw Thabo Mbeki, the former president, assuring business owners that they should donate to the ANC because \"people trust us, we fought for them \u2026 they will be patient\".</p> <p>The patience now appears exhausted. Critics say white capital was essentially left untouched and that the purportedly socialist ANC was co-opted by the establishment.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/18/south-african-miners-julius-malema\" title=\"\">Malema has been calling for a revolution that will make the mines ungovernable until they are nationalised</a>. He has lashed out at British firms such as Lonmin for scooping mineral resources from under the soil upon which workers live in squalid conditions.</p> <p>Lonmin is easily portrayed as a ruthless capitalist vulture presiding over Orwellian conditions, but the details are bitterly disputed. Mineworkers continue to insist they are paid R4,000 a month and want R12,500. Lonmin asserts that most workers get about 10,500, if bonuses are included.</p> <p>Economists claim this amount would put them <a href=\"http://www.bdlive.co.za/opinion/2012/09/03/lonmins-poor-workers-are-not-as-poor-as-they-think\" title=\"\">in the top 25% of formal-sector earners in South Africa</a>. \"There are a hell of a lot of people in the country worse off than those miners,\" said one.</p> <p>Yet it is hard to gloss over the bleak landscape in Marikana, where mine headgear spins, chimneys belch smoke, &#xa0;and giant corrugated steel and concrete silos loom over scrubland dotted with shacks, rubbish and dung.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2012-08-30-yawning-gap-between-lonmin-and-communities\" title=\"\">Bench Marks Foundation, an organisation monitoring corporate social responsibility, has described a \"yawning gap\" between Lonmin's promises and the experience of local communities</a>. \"They don't engage, they don't communicate properly with the community,\" it said.</p> <p>Defenders of Lonmin argue that housing is also a local government responsibility and that many mine workers use part of their wage to maintain homes in distant provinces.</p> <p>Lonmin claimed: \"There are factual inaccuracies within the Bench Marks report and the company doesn't agree with all the findings. However, it does acknowledge that there are certain areas in which it could be doing better. This is a challenge faced by the entire mining community and requires the co-operation and involvement of many parties.\"</p> <p>Writing in South Africa's Sunday Times, Ramaphosa admitted: \"There are few innocents in this tragic saga \u2026 For wherever we find ourselves, we cannot escape the sense that, through our action or inaction, we bear some responsibility for the circumstances that made such a tragedy possible.</p> <p>\"As we mourn, so too must we introspect \u2026 What we do now as a people will determine what we become as a nation.\"</p> <p>The government has expressed frustration at the mining sector's slow pace of transformation. The sector failed to meet last year's target of 15% black ownership, transferring only 9% of wealth into black hands. It looks unlikely to achieve the required 26% by 2014.</p> <p>The horror of Marikana and the daily grinding poverty of mines like it can be traced to boardrooms in London and elsewhere.</p> <h2><strong>Robust </strong></h2> <p>Moeletsi Mbeki, an economist and brother of the former president, said: \"It's a 140-year-old problem. The mining industry in South Africa effectively started in 1870. Marikana is telling us that the change in 1994 was to incorporate the black elite into the socioeconomic system that the white elite had been running for 140 years. It is a formula loaded with conflict in which violence keeps repeating itself.\"</p> <p>Mbeki does not expect a national \"catastrophe\" to follow but warned: \"There is a lot of popular discontent; you can't say popular discontent is not endemic. The reason why the government reacted the way it did is that they have got to show the poor they can react like the previous regime and crack down on discontent.</p> <p>\"We have seen it before with service delivery protests around the country. The difference this time is a lot of people died in one place on the property of a foreign company.\"</p> <p>Just how far could the rage spill in this, one of the world's most unequal and violent industrial societies?</p> <p>Zwelinzima Vavi, general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, has cast Marikana as a warning, \"a bomb waiting to explode\".</p> <p>Justice Malala, a political analyst, wrote of the disenfranchised: \"It might make many of us quiver with fear, but here is the cold, hard, truth: they will opt out of the current social, economic and political arrangements and they will choose anarchy.\"</p> <p>Paul Verryn, a Methodist minister visiting Marikana this week where he helped broker talks between striking workers and mine management, said the prospect of more violence \"nestles in the consciousness of all of us\".</p> <p>He said: \"We've got to look very carefully at history. It teaches us that this kind of disparity between rich and poor doesn't go to bed at night. If we don't shift we are preparing ourselves for a revolution.\"</p> <p>But while the scars of apartheid unquestionably run deep, other voices warn against nihilism. They argue that racial disparities are narrowing due to the growth of a black middle-class and a gradual but discernible increase in black ownership of companies, homes and land.</p> <p>Unlike regimes toppled by the Arab spring, South Africa is a country with robust democratic institutions, courts and civil society.</p> <p>Asked if South Africa was hurtling towards disaster, Sparks said: \"I've read that in foreign newspapers for the last 18 years. This is a substantial country, not just a pile of bricks. This is not a country in imminent crisis but it is a country being badly governed, and the constituency that always supported it is losing faith in it.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, amid allegations that police in Marikana shot some miners in cold blood or ran over them in armoured vehicles, the strike continues to boil.</p> <p>On Wednesday more than 3,000 workers took to the streets. At the head of the march one man carried a handwritten cardboard sign that read: \"Lonmin, who gave you power to kill us on our own land? Protect us Juju [Malema].</p> <p>One demonstrator said: \"We work very hard to earn peanuts. Whenever you enter the [lift] cage you risk your life. If they don't give us 12,500, we'll go back to where we're from and break the bank. We will do whatever we have to do to get money. Even if we have to kill to get money, we'll do it.\"</p> <p>Asked if he believed whether violence could ever be the answer, the miner replied: \"Sometimes violence is the answer.\"</p>",
  "<p>So this is how it's done. Students in Quebec, in rebellion against their government over tuition fees, have scored an amazing victory in the province's general elections.</p> <p>The Liberal government led by Jean Charest, which ran on a law-and-order platform against the students, has been defeated. Its plans to implement an 82% tuition fee increase <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/06/quebec-elections-minority-government-shootings\" title=\"\">are shredded</a> for now, and the <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/story/2012/05/18/quebec-student-protest-law-bill-78.html\" title=\"\">harsh emergency legislation</a> it passed to quell the upsurge <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/quebecvotes2012/story/2012/09/05/quebec-election-political-transition-charest-marois.html\" title=\"\">is history</a>. Charest is resigning from politics. Two members of the leftist group, <a href=\"http://www.quebecsolidaire.net/\" title=\"\">Qu\u00e9bec Solidaire</a>, have been elected, and the party gained more than 6% of the popular vote.</p> <p>For those used to student movements that erupt suddenly only to deflate within a few weeks or months, this defies belief. How, then, was such an effective action actually sustained, in defiance of police crackdowns and emergency legislation?</p> <p>Students in Quebec inhabit <a href=\"http://youtu.be/eBxuNoAgt_Y\" title=\"\">militant traditions</a> inherited from the \"quiet revolution\" of the 1960s, when the province's francophone majority pushed for full access to higher education as part of a series of sweeping reforms. This inaugurated a student movement, whose signature was the mass student strike. Each time a government attempted to drive up tuition fees, the students walked out \u2013 and most of the time, they won. As a result, there is a thriving democratic culture among Quebec's students. While the NUS is converting itself into a tame lobbying organisation, Quebec students have a tradition of grassroots organising, and four relatively democratic federal organisations that rank-and-file student bodies can affiliate with.</p> <p>The radical spearhead of the movement is the Coalition Large de l'Association pour une Solidarit\u00e9 Syndicale \u00c9tudiante, or Classe. Emerging from a decade of leftwing student unionism, Classe was explicitly formed in December 2011 to build a students' strike to stop the fees rise. Going further than most student bodies, it demanded the cancellation of all tuition fees, to be paid for by a tax on banks. This stance was very popular, and the group eventually incorporated 65 local affiliates and 100,000 members comprising the most politicised and activist core of the province's 400,000 strong student body.</p> <p>General assemblies of students were held across Quebec, to discuss and implement a strike. This meant boycotting and picketing classes, and at their height the strikes achieved the support of 300,000 students. The structures of direct democracy built on campuses sustained the momentum behind the strikes, enabling students to meet, discuss and make decisions on a regular basis. Each month, the movement called a mass mobilisation, with tens of thousands of students gathering in the Place du Canada in Montreal. But there was also a heated debate over the strategy and goals of the movement. It wasn't enough to keep the momentum going. In addition to the strikes, radical students sought to disrupt the smooth functioning of the economy and the government, carrying out blockades and occupations of banks and government buildings.</p> <p>But students also reached out to the labour movement. Theirs was a <a href=\"http://youtu.be/74JQQf4zfg4\" title=\"\">class issue</a>, they insisted, and Classe called for a \"social strike\" of both students and workers. They consciously sought alliances with Rio Tinto workers locked out of their jobs, public sector workers facing cuts, campaigns against increased fees for healthcare, and local resistance to the government's attempts to turn over northern resources to the mining industry. Neighbourhood protests became a regular occurrence. A number of union federations passed motions for strike action, though as yet the resistance from union leaders is too strong, and the labour militants too weak, to make it happen.</p> <p>Importantly, the student leadership refused to be divided. When the government excluded Classe from negotiations, in the hope of engaging the more moderate student federations in a compromise, the latter walked out.</p> <p>The government's biggest mistake was passing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_78\" title=\"\">Bill 78</a>, imposing severe restrictions on the right of students to protest. Though supported by the Quebec Council of Employers, the bill was otherwise reviled. Rather than breaking the students, the repression produced a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/01/quebec-protests-student-activists\" title=\"\">much wider movement</a>. Up to half a million people marched in clear defiance of the law. Those returning home from law-breaking protests were greeted by families <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/42848523\" title=\"\">banging pots and pans</a> in their support, from their windows and in the streets. Some of the country's largest trade unions joined in the protest. To get a sense of how improbable this is, compare it with our student protests beginning in November 2010, where the NUS and UCU leaderships organised timid demonstrations separate from the main protests.</p> <p>The Liberals' defeat can be traced to that defiance. But the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which has just won, is not an ally of the movement. The new government will probably seek to negotiate a smaller fees increase with the agreement of the less militant student bodies. At any rate, the movement has long been about more than fees. Classe intends to keep the pressure on, with new assemblies and protests, aiming to build the widest possible movement to challenge neoliberalism. British students should take the hint.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 September 2012. It originally referred to Qu\u00e9bec Solidaire as a student group. This has now been corrected.</p>",
  "<h2>THE CONTINUING ADVENTURES OF ADVENTUROUS MR ROY</h2> <p>As Mr Roy has spent no end of time telling everyone again and again over the years, his methods have translated from Halmstads to Malmo to Orebro to Neuch\u00e2tel Xamax to Switzerland. They certainly have! He's pressed all the right flesh at Halmstads, secured the keys to the executive washroom at Malmo, ensured he's got a bigger office than anyone else at Orebro, complimented the chairman and his wife on their wonderful taste in home furnishings at Neuch\u00e2tel Xamax and made sure he left all the rooms he went into exactly as he found them in Switzerland. Well done, Mr Roy!</p> <p>The other thing he's been really good at, fastidiously good, as Liverpool fans can attest, is going well out of his way not to offend Lord Ferg. Before the Euros, England's main talent Wayne Rooney prepared for the upcoming major international tournament by visiting the fitness centres of Las Vegas, where Elvis famously got back into shape before his successful 1978 world tour. \"I'd dispute the fact that Wayne wasn't fit in the Euros,\" insisted Mr Roy yesterday, before adding that he considered the player bowling up to work at the start of the season seven pounds overweight to be \"a matter for Sir Alex Ferguson and the club\".</p> <p>Mr Roy then detailed the intricate plans he's put in place to ensure Rooney, currently laid up after Fulham's garlic-wielding Hugo Rodallega sliced his leg open with a view to roasting the succulent joint for supper, is back up and running in time for England's crucial World Cup qualifiers against San Marino and Poland next month. \"I'm hoping the next time I meet him he'll be fit,\" he absent-mindedly muttered, preoccupied with peering out of the window to check nobody's parked in his designated space. \"I have no reason to believe he won't come back.\"</p> <p>And with those fail-safes put in place, Mr Roy turned his attention to this evening's Moldova match, Frank and $tevie Mbe's names the first on the teamsheet. They're \"good enough\", says Mr Roy of the selection that offends no big names, a pairing which will probably guide England through qualifying and all the way to the second round in Brazil in 2014. And good enough is good enough for the England manager!

The Jerusalem Children and Community Development Organisation (JeCCDO) he ran had homes across Ethiopia for orphaned and vulnerable children. There were over a thousand children in Mulugeta's care. But by 1996, he had decided that the children would thrive better back within communities.</p> <p>This idea wasn't immediately popular. But Mulugeta persevered and found that placing a child back into the care of a community could raise the standard of life for everyone. He transformed the orphanages into resource centres. Part of his model was practical; helping adopting families to set up small businesses or low-cost food production schemes. But Mulugeta's greatest legacy has been the community groups he has fostered, which have triggered fundamental shifts in attitudes and customs around health, rights and child protection.</p> <p>During these peer-led conversations, difficult issues that would normally be taboo are up for discussion. The breakthroughs have been phenomenal. One group recently took the decision to end early marriage. Another agreed to end female genital mutilation and arranged an amnesty of the knives used in the practice. In the south, a young rape victim was able to put her attacker behind bars thanks to the unprecedented support of her local women's group. Mulugeta's confidence in the capacity of communities and the power of consensus has proved to be well founded. By closing the door on one idea he has thrown open countless others for the future of Ethiopia's communities.</p> <h2>Fatima Jibrell</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397349892\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/commercial/2012/9/5/1346838180011/Fatima-Jibrell-001.jpg\" alt=\"Fatima Jibrell\" width=\"220\" height=\"250\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fatima Jibrell</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fatima Jibrell is a woman who moves against the tide. While most people were fleeing Somalia during the 1991 civil war, she was returning. Having grown up in a Somali herder community, Fatima had left as a teenager and built a new life in the United States. But she realised things would only change if Somalis converged to bring ideas, solutions and energy back to Somalia. In response, Fatima founded Horn Relief, now known as Adeso, African Development Solutions.\" Though the organisation was indeed originally called the Horn of Africa Relief and Development Organisation, it was commonly known as Horn Relief.&#xa0;</p> <p>Fatima saw the connection between peace, empowerment and resource protection. The war had destroyed natural resource management systems, jeopardising traditional ways of life. She co-founded the Resource Management Somali Network (RMSN), one of the few cross-clan networks, and was instrumental in the Puntland government's ban on the export of charcoal. But she hasn't just changed minds; she's changed the landscape. Through her \"rock dam\" initiative, communities have learnt to manage rainfall using stone piles, which halt water wastage and create spaces for plants to germinate.</p> <p>One of her greatest achievements has been empowering women and girls to take the lead in peace and conservation. She has helped to secure a constitutional minimum of 30% of government seats for women and fostered a Women's Coalition for Peace in northern Somalia. Under her guidance, youth and elder pastoralists have shared ideas around the use of fragile resources, healthcare and peace. By encouraging change from the bottom up, Fatima has ensured that the capacity for action will outlast her work.</p> <h2>Keith Waddell</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397349893\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/commercial/2012/9/5/1346838222051/Keith-Waddell-001.jpg\" alt=\"Keith Waddell\" width=\"220\" height=\"250\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keith Waddell Photograph: Picasa</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Picasa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Keith's pride peaks when he is not needed. For three decades he has travelled through Uganda training eye care workers, setting up clinics and performing thousands of operations a year to cure or prevent blindness. His Land Rover contains everything needed for a rural surgical theatre. From the front seat, he has pioneered a countrywide eye care service without pausing for civil war. Now in his seventies, he knows he has succeeded when those he has trained can save a child's sight in a tiny rural clinic without his help.</p> <p>Arriving in Uganda as a young doctor in 1964, he recognised the huge shortfall in quality care, particularly in the rural areas. He began training paramedical staff to conduct routine work. Hundreds are now running their own centres. Keith was capacity building decades before it became popular.</p> <p>Over the years, Keith kept abreast of cutting-edge techniques and introduced them to Africa. When these fail, he devises his own, relieving thousands from the pain and disability caused by eye disease. His prolific research and seminal papers have helped guide treatment across Africa bringing fresh insight on childhood blindness and complications associated with leprosy, cataracts, antimalarial drugs and HIV.</p> <p>Nothing illustrates this better than his pioneering treatment programme for retinoblastoma - a fatal childhood eye cancer. Such a complex programme would stretch a top UK hospital. Keith has done it single-handedly. After a lifetime of work, Keith has been involved in the treatment of almost every blind child in Uganda. And he is still on the road.</p> <h2>Dr Kshama Metre</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397349894\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/commercial/2012/9/5/1346838131269/Kshama-Metre-001.jpg\" alt=\"Kshama Metre\" width=\"220\" height=\"250\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Kshama Metre</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sometimes you need to step back to see a solution, but sometimes you need to move closer. Paediatrician Kshama Metre left a flourishing medical practice in Delhi to provide healthcare to isolated Himalayan villagers. Moving between communities, she was faced with an inextricable web of social and economic issues: illiteracy, unemployment, an exodus of skilled labour, poverty, alcoholism, gender violence. For Kshama, it was clear that any practical solution would need to be holistic and look beyond the symptoms to tackle the causes.</p> <p>She founded Chinmaya Organisation for Rural Development (Cord), establishing a multi-faceted programme as a direct response to the multi-layer rural poverty that affects 70% of India's population. 25 years later and Cord has worked with almost 700 remote communities. To combat widespread unemployment, it has sparked income generation schemes. Responding to urban-centric government investment, Cord pioneered the first micro-financing programme in India. Bridging the uneasy relationship between villagers and the police, they trained lawyers to ensure disputes and complaints could be aired without intimidation.</p> <p>Drawing on her background as a doctor, Kshama has used maternal and child health as a gateway into communities, drawing over 10,000 women and girls into peer support groups. One particular women's group, The Mahila Mandals, has grown into a force for change, challenging the government, unruly citizens and corruption, all while managing their own households. Their success is a prime example of how one woman's insight has triggered a wave of development through empowerment as opposed to welfare dependence.</p> <h2>Qamar Naseem</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397349895\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/commercial/2012/9/5/1346838358215/Qamar-Naseem-001.jpg\" alt=\"Qamar Naseem\" width=\"220\" height=\"250\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Qamar Naseem.

But Qamar Naseem never paid much attention to the rules. From a conservative family, his mother was beaten as a child because she wanted to go to school. Qamar would also put himself at risk to stand up for women's rights. Along with 11 others, he formed Blue Veins, a campaign about breast cancer awareness. Speaking openly about the importance of breast self-examination and sexual health, Qamar found himself a target of the ultra-conservative and militant Muslim groups. He was undeterred by the intimidation.</p> <p>He saw a critical gap in the way women's health education programmes failed to include men. He found ways to reach out to imams and village leaders and has since established over 300 community committees for women and men to discuss issues such as child marriage or domestic violence. He has supported and sparked a myriad of community and infrastructural projects that foster gender equality.</p> <p>During the 2010 floods, Qamar openly criticised the lack of reproductive and sexual health facilities in the emergency camps, triggering the establishment of a national disaster response desk for women. He has since lobbied for women's rights legislation in tribal areas where such laws rarely apply. He has highlighted the correlation between keeping young girls out of marriage and in school and their economic potential as wage earners.</p> <p>By using gender as a lens, Qamar has introduced a broader perspective on national development to the benefit of the whole society.</p>",
  "<p><em>[Updated below - Update II]</em></p> <p>One of the formative events shaping my views of the last decade's American political landscape was watching the 2004 Republican national convention. An expertly staged, supremely manipulative ritual of jingoism and leader-worship, I regarded it with an equal measure of awe and horror. </p> <p>America's militarism was continuously exploited by speaker after speaker to glorify the commander-in-chief, George W Bush, as a brave and noble warrior for American Greatness. Each mention of war and killing prompted his delirious followers to erupt in the same boisterous crowd-chant: \"USA, USA.\" Bush's opponent (and his supporters), by contrast, were vilified as soft-on-the-terrorists, troop-hating, America-despising weaklings who lacked the stomach to Keep Us Safe.</p> <p>Typifying all of this was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54299-2004Sep1.html\">Dick Cheney's vice-presidential acceptance speech</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"As in other times, we are in a war we did not start, and have no choice but to win. </p> <p>(APPLAUSE)</p> <p>\"Firm in our resolve, focused on our mission, and led by a superb commander-in-chief, we will prevail.</p> <p>(APPLAUSE)</p> <p>\"The fanatics who killed some 3,000 of our fellow Americans may have thought they could attack us with impunity, because terrorists had done so previously.</p> <p>\"But if the killers of September 11 thought we had lost the will to defend our freedom, they did not know America, and they did not know George W Bush.</p> <p>(APPLAUSE)</p> <p>\"From the beginning, the president made clear that the terrorists would be dealt with and that anyone who supports, protects or harbors them would be held to account. </p> <p>(APPLAUSE)</p> <p>\"President Bush does not deal in empty threats and half measures. And his determination has sent a clear message \u2026</p> <p>\"Even in this post 9/11 period, Senator Kerry doesn't appear to understand how the world has changed. He talks about leading a 'more sensitive war on terror' \u2026</p> <p>(LAUGHTER)</p> <p>\" \u2026 as though al-Qaida will be impressed with our softer side.</p> <p>(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)</p> <p>\"He declared at the Democratic convention that he will forcefully defend America after we have been attacked. My fellow Americans, we have already been attacked \u2026\"</p> <p>(APPLAUSE)</p> <p>[AUDIENCE:] \"USA. USA. USA.\"</p> <p>[CHENEY:] \"But as the President has made very clear, there is a difference between leading a coalition of many nations and submitting to the objections of a few. </p> <p>(APPLAUSE)</p> <p>\"George W Bush will never seek a permission slip to defend the American people.\"</p> <p>(APPLAUSE)</p> <p>[AUDIENCE:] \"USA. USA. USA.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It went on and on like that, speaker after speaker. The same chant erupted when Bush, in <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57466-2004Sep2.html\">his acceptance speech</a>, declared that ever since 9/11, \"I wake up every morning thinking about how to better protect our country. I will never relent in defending America \u2013 whatever it takes.\" It erupted again when he added:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"In Saddam Hussein, we saw a threat. Members of both political parties, including my opponent and his running-mate, saw the threat, and voted to authorize the use of force.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I thought, or at least hoped, that such vulgar crowd celebrations of leader-reverence, jingoism and militarism would not soon be replicated. But on Thursday night, the final night of the Democratic party convention, it was.</p> <p>It is hard to count how many times a Democratic party speaker stood up proudly to proclaim:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Osama. Bin. Laden. Is. Dead!</p> </blockquote> <p>Almost every time Bin Laden's scalp was paraded around on its pike \u2013 all thanks to the warrior spirit and unflinching courage of our commander-in-chief \u2013 the crowd of progressives, liberals and party faithful erupted into a prolonged \"USA. USA\" chant.</p> <p>Leading this orgy of chest-beating, we're-more-bellicose-than-you, nationalistic strutting was, ironically, the 2004 GOP's prime victim of it: Democratic Senator John Kerry. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/dnc-2012-john-kerrys-speech-to-the-democratic-national-convention-full-text/2012/09/06/bb73367e-f87c-11e1-a073-78d05495927c_story_2.html\">Kerry's speech</a> exploited virtually every theme of patriotism and militarism that was used against him eight years ago, and he did so with great efficacy.</p> <p>Like <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/report/obama-foreign-policy-successes/\">Obama advocates so often do</a>, Kerry first trumpeted how faithful and loyal Obama is to the Israeli government, and held up the Israeli prime minister as the arbiter of truth and sufficient loyalty:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"'Barack Obama promised always to stand with Israel to tighten sanctions on Iran \u2013 and take nothing off the table.</p> <p>\"'Again and again, the other side has lied about where this president stands and what this president has done. But Prime Minister Netanyahu set the record straight \u2013 he said, our two countries have 'exactly the same policy' \u2013 'our security cooperation is unprecedented.' When it comes to Israel, I'll take the word of Israel's prime minister over Mitt Romney any day.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Kerry, to the delight of the crowd, strongly insinuated that Romney harbors disrespect for the sacred American troops (that is: our brave men and women in uniform): </p> <blockquote> <p>\"And let me say \u2013 let me say something else \u2013 let me say something else, no nominee for president should ever fail in the midst of a war to pay tribute to our troops overseas in his acceptance speech.</p> <p>(APPLAUSE)</p> <p>\"Mitt Romney \u2013 Mitt Romney was talking about America. They are on the front lines every day defending America and they deserve our thanks.\"</p> <p>(APPLAUSE)</p> <p>[AUDIENCE:] \"USA! USA! USA!\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And, most pointedly of all, he milked the Bin Laden killing for everything it was worth, and then some:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"And after more than \u2013 after more than 10 years without justice for thousands of Americans murdered on 9/11, after Mitt Romney said it would be naive to go into Pakistan to pursue the terrorists, it took President Obama, against the advice of many, to give that order and finally rid this earth of Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>(APPLAUSE)</p> <p>\"Ask Osama bin Laden is he is better-off now than he was four years ago.\"</p> <p>(APPLAUSE)</p> </blockquote> <p>Yeah: ask Osama bin Laden if he's better off \u2013 if you can find his corpse where our commander-in-chief dumped it: at the bottom of the ocean. USA! USA!</p> <p>For the moment, leave aside one's views on the justness and legality of the Bin Laden killing. (For reasons <a href=\"http://opiniojuris.org/2012/08/29/author-of-no-easy-day-admits-to-committing-a-war-crime\">adeptly set forth here</a> by international law professor Kevin Jon Heller, I really don't understand how one can have a favorable opinion on that without actually knowing what happened, which may be the reason John Kerry is <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/politicolive/0511/Kerry_Shut_up_and_move_on_.html\">so insistent</a> that nobody try to find out.) Whether or not one is still stimulated when thinking about that exciting raid, there is obvious meaning in how central it has become to the political identity of America and, especially, the self-esteem of the Democratic party.</p> <p>It is a truly potent indicator that this grand achievement has become the greatest source of nationalistic pride. Americans once found national purpose \u2013 justification for their belief in their own exceptionalism \u2013 from inventing new life-improving technologies, or putting a man on the moon, or advancing the cause of equality, or vanquishing the mighty Nazi military machine, or enshrining unparalleled protections for core liberties in the constitution. </p> <p>Now, many Americans find it in the heroic ability to hunt someone down who is in hiding, pummel his skull full of bullets even as he lay dying on the ground, and then dump his corpse into the ocean. That such actions are the new source of American pride, vindication of national greatness, was the claim made by President Obama when he <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/05/02/135908803/video-and-text-of-the-presidents-statement-on-death-of-bin-laden\">first announced the killing</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"But tonight, we are once again reminded that America can do whatever we set our mind to. That is the story of our history.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>If one wants to mount a political defense of all of this \u2013 that it is about time the Democrats gave the GOP a taste of its own medicine, that Kerry, in particular, has the right to exact vengeance, that anything is justified to win the election, etc \u2013 that's fine. I have no real quarrel with, or interest in, that perspective. In so many ways \u2013 political adeptness, party solidarity, effective exploitation of national security for political gain, media favorability, message discipline \u2013 the two parties have experienced a radical role reversal in the matter of a few short years, and it's understandable why one is happy about that if one's overarching political concern is Obama's re-election.</p> <p>But the collective bloodlust on display over the last week, especially Thursday night, was nothing short of creepy. Even in those instances in which state killing is justified and necessary, it ought to be a sombre and regrettable affair (as many Democrats <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/gop-debate-crowd-applauds-gov-rick-perrys-record-of-executions-in-texas/\">righteously argued</a> when some attendees at a GOP debate cheered Texas Governor Rick Perry's touting of his execution record). Boastful, raucous, nationalistic crowd-chanting at every single mention of someone's corpse, even when that someone is Osama bin Laden, is warped.</p> <p>But, more importantly, it's a depressing symbol of America's political culture. The premise seems to be that \u2013 aside from this specific corpse and the others the president has piled up \u2013 there is little else for ordinary Americans to celebrate now when it comes to the search for nationalistic achievement, purpose and greatness among their political leadership. That this dark premise appears valid is what is most disturbing of all.</p> <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> As Gawker's pseudonymous writer Mobutu Sese Seko <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5941276/running-on-empty-obama-omitted-details-drones-and-his-best-chance-at-dynamism\">notes in an excellent review of the night's festivities</a>, Joe Biden \"laid it on especially thickly when it came to talking about whacking Osama bin Laden\". Among other things, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/06/160713378/transcript-vice-president-bidens-convention-speech\">the vice president crowed</a> that \"Obama is our president because he always has the courage to make the tough decisions.\" Of the kill order: \"He said, do it \u2013 and justice was done!\" And then:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"And he also knew \u2013 he also knew the message we had to send around the world: if you attack innocent Americans, we will follow you to the end of the earth.</p> <p>(CHEERS, APPLAUSE.)</p> <p>\"Look \u2026\"</p> <p>[AUDIENCE:] \"USA! USA! USA! USA!\"</p> </blockquote> <p>He further suggests that it may not be \"justice\" that is achieved by \"a double-tap to the brain of a sclerotic masturbating whitehair and his family, in the dead of night, by trained killers.\" Rather, he argues, \"justice\" likely entails \u2013 following the Allied and Israeli example of how Nazi war criminals were treated \u2013 a trial, with evidence of guilt shown to the world, and a deliberative punishment then meted out.</p> <p>Again, though, regardless of one's views on that question, there is a world of difference between approving of the Bin Laden hit, on the one hand, and gathering together to chant nationalistic slogans and feel pulsating crowd-based power from it, on the other.</p> <p><strong>UPDATE II</strong>: I believe I just saw one of the best videos ever: Gawker's John Cook spent several days asking numerous Democratic luminaries at the convention about Obama's kill list and whether they would trust Mitt Romney to decide which Americans should be extra-judicially assassinated. Other than Bill Press, none reacted well, and <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5941326/ask-the-dnc-is-romney-ready-for-the-kill-list\">it is really worth watching</a>.</p>",

  "<p>The revolution is being branded. A young Turkish graphic designer from the small border town of Kilis in Turkey has been commissioned by the Free Syrian Army (FSA) to design their logo.</p> <p>More accustomed to creating posters declaring \"girls need to go to school\" for the local municipality's education programmes, 28-year-old Sedat Akpinar looked up from his computer to find the FSA's northern border commander, Abu Hayder, standing in his shop.</p> <p>With designers and materials in short supply in Syria, the commander had crossed the border last week, hoping to find someone in Turkey who could help him create \"an identifiable symbol\" to be placed on cars, trucks, tanks, T-shirts, baseball caps and bandannas.</p> <p>With him, Hayder had brought his \"quality controller\": an FSA soldier with a background in design, now occupied as a full-time sniper. The recruit had a bullet wound in his arm over which he had tattooed a sword. \"Designed by me!\" he declared proudly.</p> <p>Sedat didn't feel like arguing, so he set about mocking up a design employing the green, white and black and three red stars of the Syrian flag superimposed with an eagle and an assault rifle \"representing war\".</p> <p>Speaking only Turkish, the designer then had to draft in one of his neighbours, a local smuggler who spoke Arabic. Together, they were able to build the Arabic characters for \"Northern Storm Brigade\", a branch of the FSA, across the top of the insignia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395747831\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/9/6/1346932823595/The-Free-Syrian-Armys-new-001.jpg\" alt=\"The Free Syrian Army's new branding.\" width=\"200\" height=\"152\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Free Syrian Army's new branding.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seamus Mirodan/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once he had approved the final mock-up, the FSA commander instructed Sedat to print 300 stickers with the logo, each with a different number, as number plates for his army's vehicles. The printing had to be done on the spot: Hayder was returning to Syria that day. But he assured Sedat that he would return shortly to order black T-shirts and baseball caps embossed with the logo. \"If we take Aleppo we want all the fighters in our brigade to look the same when we enter the town,\" he explained.</p> <p>Even as the bullets fly, this very 21st century rebel group appears to understand the power of branding and the media. By building a unified image, the commander told Sedat, the FSA is seeking to present itself as a force with the trappings of statehood, capable of not only looking to the future with confidence, but also taking a central role in driving change at the heart of the Syrian government.</p> <p>The man who controls the FSA's operations around the border with Turkey then handed the designer $300 (\u00a3187) and a flash drive full of footage and photographs of the conflict.

Former prime minister Tony Blair has been advising the Qataris.</p> <p>Glencore raised its offer for mining giant Xstrata and pledged to put its own chief executive in charge of the enlarged company instead of his longstanding friend and rival Mick Davis, the Xstrata chief who could now be forced out, having stood <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/31/xstrata-chief-windfall\" title=\"\">to gain \u00a350m in retention packages</a> if the original deal had gone ahead as planned.</p> <p>The last-minute intervention of Blair helped persuade Glencore's chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, to raise the terms of his offer for Xstrata, minutes before the shareholder meetings in Switzerland to vote on the original terms.</p> <p>The combined group would be the world's largest producer of zinc, control just under a third of the coal used for power stations and trade wheat, sugar and oil in more than 40 countries around the world, putting it at the centre of the global trade in vital commodities.</p> <p>Friday's drama unfolded after Blair brought together Glasenberg and Qatari prime minister Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, who has taken personal control of negotiations after the gulf state's sovereign wealth fund Qatar Holdings amassed a 12% stake in Xstrata. As the second largest shareholder, Qatar's support is crucial for any deal.</p> <p>Such was the brinkmanship that the boards of both companies, which are listed on the London stock market, were already gathered in Zug even though the deal was expected to be voted down after the Qataris had made clear their opposition to the original terms.</p> <p>Forcing Xstrata to delay the start of its meeting by 10 minutes, Glasenberg proposed higher terms which caused confusion by lacking detail and not being a formal offer under takeover panel rules.</p> <p>But it was far from clear last night that Glasenberg had succeeded in winning the support of the Qataris, particularly if he pressed on with the attempt to put himself in charge of the enlarged company instead of Davis. Glasenberg, arguably the highest profile commodities trader in the world, and Davis, synonymous with the Xstrata mining company, have known each other since their days at Witwatersrand University in South Africa. Glasenberg was originally to have been deputy to Davis, who could now be forced out even though it had previously been argued that lucrative retention packages were needed to ensure that he remained at the helm for the next three years.</p> <p>Under the new proposal Glencore has offered 3.05 of its shares for every Xstrata share \u2013 up from 2.8 \u2013 but still below the 3.25 shares that Qatar had previously insisted was the price at which it would be prepared to back the deal. Glencore was a secretive trading house until it floated on the stock market last year, when it was widely expected to use its 34% stake of Xstrata as the basis for an attempt to take full control of the mining company in a deal <a href=\"ttp://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/07/glencore-xstrata-confirm-90-billion-merger\" title=\"\">eventually announced in February</a>.</p> <p>Xstrata said the new terms, a premium of 17.6% over Xstrata's share price before the merger was announced, were \"significantly lower than would be expected in a takeover\". Its shares rose 3.5% to 1014p while Glencore fell 3% to 378p.</p> <p>While the City awaited the verdict of Qatar Holdings, other investors made their views known.</p> <p>David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life Investments \u2013 which holds 1.4% of Xstrata and 0.8% of Glencore \u2013 reversed his opposition to the terms. Cumming said: \"We are supportive of the improved terms and the changes to the executive governance arrangements.\"</p> <p>But Richard Buxton, head of UK equities at Schroders, remained opposed.</p> <p>\"The Qataris are the kingmakers and it partly depends on what they do \u2026 but it will clearly affect how long we wish to remain an investor in the combined entity if it occurs on these terms,\" he told Reuters.</p> <p>\"My gut tells me that Ivan has played this very cleverly \u2026 he's met them halfway, declared this as a takeover and there's no clarity on whether Mick or any of his team are going to be involved,\" he added.</p> <h2>What was Blair's role?</h2> <p>He may not be quite so effective if you're after an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/02/tony-blair-iraq-war-desmond-tutu\" title=\"\">introduction to Desmond Tutu</a>, but if you want a quick chat with Qatari royalty then Tony Blair's your man. The former prime minister-cum-consultant to the world's billionaires <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/07/glencore-delay-xstrata-merger-vote\" title=\"\">was the operator who connected Glencore boss Ivan Glasenberg with Qatar's PM, Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani</a>, and that little introduction seems to have eradicated an intractable issue that the emirate's sovereign wealth fund had with the commodity trader's bid for Xstrata.</p> <p>This type of financial sorcery does not come cheap but Blair has pulled off the magic before, having acted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/11/court-tony-blair-hotels-bid\" title=\"\">as an intermediary between Irish property investor Patrick McKillen and Sheikh Hamad</a> over a potential \u00a370m hotel investment. His relationship with the Qataris also played a starring role in a Channel 4 Dispatches investigation, where it emerged he persuaded the <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/blair-role-in-palestine-contracts-gives-rise-to-conflicts-of-interest\" title=\"\">Israelis to open up radio frequencies allowing Wataniya Mobile</a> (majority owner, Qatari telecoms giant QTEL) to operate in the West Bank.</p> <p>QTEL is also a major client of JP Morgan, which pays Blair around $2m a year. JP Morgan is also Xstrata's lead adviser and allowed its client to accept a lowball bid, until Blair's intervention. It is a novel approach to being an adviser. A third way, some might call it. <strong>Simon Goodley</strong></p>",

He didn't just deliver a great address, he reminded us what political rhetoric can be \u2013 elevating, challenging, informative, respectful to those of us listening, rather than the patronising spew of TV soundbites that passes as oratory these days (we've heard plenty of that this week as well).</p> <p>The spirit of the delegates. They schlepped to Charlotte from all over the country, endured appalling weather, then most of them were told at the last minute they couldn't get into the arena after the larger stadium event was cancelled. And still, after all that, they were singing and chanting and laughing as they filed in to the spill-over room. Now that's dedication.</p> <p>And finally Gabby Giffords. We expect courage in our leaders, and are so often disappointed. Giffords' slightly shuffling walk across the stage, in front of 20,000 delegates and millions more watching on TV, and her delivery of an almost perfect Pledge of Allegiance, was a display of bravery in its purest form. How Americans can watch that, then not rise up as one nation to demand gun control, is beyond me.</p> <h2>Ana Marie Cox</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395819912\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/28/1317225418768/Annmarie_Cox.jpg\" alt=\"Ana Marie Cox\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The nosebleed-level press seats strategically placed behind the backdrop to the convention podium would be easy to complain about: the lines of sight gave a great view of the black curtains on either side of the stage but you could see neither the speaker nor the giant television projection of the speaker. But Bill Clinton is so good, it hardly mattered. I could see the teleprompter. </p> <p>As the Big Dog waltzed through a thicket of policy points, dropping drawl-inflected catchphrases, the teleprompter stuttered. He gracefully ad-libbed, and the prompter showed in real time the exact degree to which his rhetoric soared without a net. It was a small insight in some ways \u2013 everyone knows Clinton can't stick to a script \u2013 but a big lesson if you compare it to the Eastwood debacle of the week before: there is no amount of acting experience, and extemporizing what to say, that can compensate for knowing what people want to hear.</p> <h2>Gary Younge</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395819913\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/artsblog/authorpics/gary_younge.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Younge\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My favourite moment was the spunky, rousing and quite eccentric contribution by the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Emanuel Cleaver. Part sermon, part polemic, off-script but on message, he fired up the audience more than any other speaker I saw this week. Theatrical to a fault he called on the audience to persevere against Republican intransigence and support the president in doing the same. Marching on the spot he said: \"Mr President when all hope is gone, hope on!\" he said \"Hope on! It is our hope and faith that moves us to action! It is our hope that instructs us to hope on!\"</p> <h2>Richard Adams</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395819914\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/artsblog/authorpics/richard_adams.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Adams\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The highlight for me was the difference in tone in Charlotte compared with the Republicans in Tampa \u2013 something that was made clear on the opening day of the DNC.</p> <p>Tuesday's session was packed full of compelling testimony and a realization that the Democrats weren't going to run away from policies on healthcare, equal pay and abortion as they have in the past.</p> <p>While the rescheduled first day in Tampa was a snoozefest, Tuesday in Charlotte had the sight of Cory Booker banging the podium with fervor, Tammy Duckworth walking on stage with two artificial limbs, mute testimony to her service in Iraq, and former Ohio governor Ted Strickland launching into a barnburner, accusing Mitt Romney of \"lying and hiding\" his policies and tax returns. There was the redoubtable Lilly Ledbetter on the fight for equal pay and Maryland governor Martin O'Malley calling Romney unpatriotic, saying \"Swiss bank accounts never built an American bridge.\"</p> <p>And all that was before the night's keynotes from Julian Castro and Michelle Obama.</p> <p>Tuesday's electricity set the stage for Bill Clinton's triumphant speech the following night and gave the DNC an attitude that it never lost.</p> <h2>Adam Gabbatt </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395819915\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/4/19/1334856266547/Adam-Gabbatt-byline-pic-003.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Gabbatt byline pic\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Gabbatt byline pic. Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Former Arizona congresswoman Gabby Giffords leading the convention in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance on Thursday was incredibly moving. Giffords, who is still struggling with injuries from when she was shot during a constituency meeting in Tucson last year, was accompanied by close friend and DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz but made her way unaided across the stage, beaming every step of the way. Giffords resigned from Congress in January to focus on her recovery, and was clearly delighted to return to the political arena to deliver the pledge. The pride and passion as she spoke was clear to see, and translated to the crowd, who variously cheered, applauded, and wept.</p> <h2>Ewen MacAskill</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395819916\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/01/21/ewen_macaskill_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Ewen Macaskill\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Bill Clinton provided the most memorable moments of either convention. Brilliant, old-fashioned speech, from the days before teleprompters became all-dominant. I have seen him speak lots of times since first hearing him on a rainy night in Belfast in the 1990s, trying to keep the tentative peace talks alive and he did. </p> <p>That night in Belfast was special, but so was his speech in Charlotte. The Obama campaign has been struggling to provide a coherent, consistent message for why voters should re-elect the president: Clinton provided them with one. Ad-libbing for much of the speech, he was able to make detailed policy issues accessible. Towards the end, there was a danger he was starting to lose the crowd, going on a little too long, and just at that point he summed it all up.</p>",

And it's still possible to detect the thumbprints of ham-fists in this finished product, for all its more palatable title. There's that pre-credits Hiroshima footage, cautioning us not to underestimate the effects of atomic annihilation. There's some marital barneys noisily underscored with political subtext. And there's a very on-the-nose poem penned by our youthful heroine.</p> <p>But, by and large, Ginger &amp; Rosa is a miracle of wing-clipping, which launches Potter back into the mainstream for the first time since <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107756/\" title=\"\">Orlando</a> (1992). After the niche charms of 2004's Yes (iambic pentameter mixed-race romance with Greek chorus) and fashionista mystery Rage (which enjoyed the UK's first mobile phone premiere in 2009), you'd be forgiven for suspecting she was no longer interested in courting wider consumption. You'd be wrong.</p> <p>The skill Potter has honed most in the last three years is assembly. On board this time around are two new collaborators: editor Anders Refn (father of Nicolas Winding, colleague of Lars von Trier) and Andrea Arnold's cinematographer, Robbie Ryan. So, a film that could have fallen prey to longeurs motors along; what might have stifled (there's a lot of scenes in kitchens) breathes and gleams.</p> <p>But Potter's chief strength remains the same: snagging stars, then steering them. Elle Fanning, 13 at the time of shooting, is almost alarmingly good as Londoner Ginger, the naive, idealistic, imperious nascent boho, forever fretting over the nuclear threat (justifiably, suggests the film). Potter shoots the early scenes of her and bosom buddy Rosa (Alice Englert, Jane Campion's daughter), skipping over bomb sites, shrinking their jeans in the bath and copping off with boys at bus-stops, as dreamy nostalgia pieces \u2013 all giggles and hair.</p> <p>Both girls are full of repulsion for their mothers; in Rosa's case a worn-out housewife whose husband jumped ship years back; in Ginger's, Christina Hendricks, not wholly convicing as a downtrodden artist baking hopeful pies and failing to keep hold of glamorous pacificist husband Roland (Alessandro Nivolli, excellent). \"No wonder they can't keep hold of their men,\" says Rosa, with an eye on Roland, who succumbs during a nightmarish mini break on his batchelor sailboat with the two girls. There's something genuinely shocking about the scene, just as the warm up, in which Roland compares the happy confines of the boat to his spell behind bars for conscientious objection (\"A prison is the ugliest expression of minimalism\") is shot with real sly humour.</p> <p>Potter proves as good on the wonky logic of parents as she does on the self-righteousness of youth. Roland is sympathetic behind his bluster, and Potter allows for the possibility that he really does see seducing his daughter's underage best friend as a protest against the mindless ideologue. But the same over-egging suggested by \"Bomb\" endures, too, in decisions such as the one to give Ginger not just one sympathetic adult ear but three: godfather Timothy Spall and his boyfriend Oliver Platt, plus Annette Bening as their lefty feminist pal. With friends like these, who needs objectivity?</p>",
  "<p>The 23-year-old composer and clarinettist <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/marksimpsoncomposer\" title=\"\">Mark Simpson</a> is used to doing things in a hurry. He was a prodigiously fast learner on his instrument, mastering the clarinet soon after he first picked it up aged nine. A handful of years later, he was the first person ever to win both the BBC Young Musician of the Year and the BBC Proms/Guardian Young Composer award, he has written a <a href=\"http://www.boosey.com/pages/cr/composer/composer_main.asp?composerid=18581&amp;ttype=BIOGRAPHY&amp;ttitle=Biography\" title=\"\">string of orchestral pieces</a>, and he has a first from Oxford and a master's from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.</p> <p>But even this Liverpudlian prodigy, whose talents were nurtured at King David's high school, a state secondary rather than a hot-housing specialist music school, and whose family have no background in music, had to pick up the pace for the highest-profile commission of his life: he was asked in March to write the opening piece for the world's single most famous classical music gig, the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/whats-on/2012/september-08\" title=\"\">Last Night of the Proms</a>. The brief? To compose an effervescent concert opener to be watched and heard by millions around the world. And he had to do it in just three months. \"I don't know who pulled out so they had to ask me,\" he jokes, but he completed his piece by the end of June. The result is \"an orchestral firecracker\" called sparks \u2013 uncapitalised, because as Simpson says, \"I'm really bad at titles, and a friend gave me this one and said it looked better all lower case\".</p> <p>It's the kind of commission that makes composers quake in their boots: so little time, so much pressure. But that's not how Simpson felt when he was writing it. \"To be honest, I just had to forget about this whole idea of the Last Night, the biggest concert in classical music. I just wanted to write the best piece I could as an exuberant, celebratory piece to open a concert.\" Simpson hasn't held back in making sparks as jam-packed a four minutes as he could. \"The piece is incredibly difficult to play. There are a lot of notes and a lot of detail.\" So how are the BBC Symphony Orchestra and their conductor Jiri Belohlavek coping? \"We've only had one rehearsal, and they picked it up really quickly. There's an unrelenting energy throughout the music that borders on the edge of collapsing. There's always a nervousness, and instability, in its energy. And I explode the orchestra at the very end. It really goes off.\"</p> <p>That sounds like vintage Simpson. Vintage, when he's only 23? Well, yes. Simpson has already proved himself capable of bold, brilliant imagination in his orchestral music, works like <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/marksimpsoncomposer/music/songs/threads-for-orchestra-53891435\" title=\"\">Threads</a> or <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/marksimpsoncomposer/music/songs/a-mirror-fragment-53891675\" title=\"\">A mirror-fragment \u2026 </a> both of which he wrote in 2008. Simpson is honest enough to reveal his models as a composer; for sparks, he mentions <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw_o0s1eubw\" title=\"\">Thomas Ad\u00e8s</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi4A9bPDvTc\" title=\"\">John Adams</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZmSe2aPBTY\" title=\"\">Oliver Knussen</a>. And while you can hear those obvious influences in his music, Simpson filters them through his own language, achieving his main aim as a composer: as he says, to combine \"surface beauty with inner logic\".</p> <p>But the Proms commission is the fulfilment of more than just a musical ambition. It's a proper dream come true. A couple of years ago, Simpson and his friend and fellow composer Gavin Higgins gazed longingly down from their seats in the rafters of the Royal Albert Hall to the Prom happening beneath them. \"We were flipping through the programme, and I nudged him and said: I wonder how long we'll have to wait till we're featured composers at the Proms.\" Just two years later, both have new pieces in the season (Higgins's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/whats-on/2012/august-12/14195\" title=\"\">Der Aufstand</a> was heard last month).</p> <p>Simpson's sparks will catalyse his family as much as the watching millions on Saturday. \"Growing up, I used to watch the Last Night with my mum. My family are coming to the Royal Albert Hall, and I know they'll get swept up in the whole Last Night fever at the end of the concert. To be honest, I think they'll enjoy that side of it more than the first half\" \u2013 with the exception of sparks, of course \u2013 \"and all that partying\". Land of Hope and Glory will thrill the flag-wavers as usual, but if you want the real innovation of the concert, prepare to have your ears and imagination exploded by Simpson's sparks.</p>",

  "<p>It's time for our weekly roundup of the best new Android apps for smartphones and tablets, drawn from a mixture of Google Play digging, press releases and submissions from developers.</p> <p>Games aren't included \u2013 they get a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2012/sep/06/best-mobile-games-avengers-horn\">separate roundup</a> which has plenty of Android games this week. The weekly iOS apps roundup will be published later in the day.</p> <p>Here's this week's Android selection:</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twoergo.appshell.pe\">PizzaExpress</a></h2> <p>Fancy a pizza? UK chain Pizza Express' innovative app has been ported from iOS to Android, enabling customers to book tables, and then pay for their bill using PayPal at the end of their meals. The app will also provide regular offer codes, and it ties in with the chain's Click &amp; Collect takeaway-ordering service too.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.radiumone.viame_android\">Via.me</a></h2> <p>Pitching itself as a \"social storyboard\", Via.me is an app for sharing photos, videos, audio and text on a standalone social network, as well as through Facebook and Twitter. That means photo filters, feeds of friends' activity \u2013&#xa0;assuming they're on it, of course \u2013&#xa0;and notifications aplenty.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.whitehouse\">White House</a></h2> <p>The official White House app has been out for a little while, but what's new this week is a version for Android tablets, just as the US presidential election gets into swing. Expect news, photos and videos from the White House, including live video streams of events featuring the president himself, and his officials.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quora.android\">Quora</a></h2> <p>Lots of people in Silicon Valley have been getting excited about Q&amp;A service Quora for a while now, thanks to plenty of tech executives giving candid views on their industry. Can it become more mainstream through mobile apps? The new Android version is a step in that direction, providing a usable window into Quora, and lots of Android-specific widgetry and features.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aurasma.skinned.richard_and_judy_book_club\">Richard and Judy Book Club</a></h2> <p>Out on iOS a couple of weeks ago, WHSmith's official app for this year's Richard and Judy Book Club initiative is the latest example of branded augmented reality. Using HP subsidiary Aurasma's AR technology, it encourages readers to scan covers of participating books to watch reviews and other videos.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.utorrent.client\">\u00b5Torrent Beta</a></h2> <p>Possibly controversial, this, but on the basis that it's a significant new release \u2013&#xa0;and that there are a number of non-copyright-infringing uses for it \u2013&#xa0;\u00b5Torrent makes our selection this week. It's a beta Android client for one of BitTorrent's two clients (the other, BitTorrent itself, already has an Android beta). For now it's free, and aims to make it easy to find and download torrents, including RSS feed subscriptions.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.telly\">Telly</a></h2> <p>This sounds like it should be some kind of social TV / second-screen app, but actually it's more of a social videos play, taking on Socialcam and Viddy. The idea: shoot videos, add music, and then share on Facebook and Twitter, as well as through Telly's own standalone social network. It's the work of Twitvid, which was one of the first social video startups.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kinderphone.kinder\">KinderPhone</a></h2> <p>This app is the latest attempt to make Android smartphones safe for children (see also: Famigo Sandbox). The idea is that parents install the app on their child's phone, and can then monitor what they're doing in terms of apps, social networking and calls. It also has \"check-ins messages\" to make it quicker for children to let their parents know their current location. A bit Big Brother? That's a debate worth having. If a child is old enough to be given an Android smartphone, are they also old enough to not have their usage of it monitored this closely?</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stuxbot.android.bbs\">Blue Badge Style</a></h2> <p>Stuxbot Technology's new Android app wants to be \"a guide for a less able lifestyle\". That means a location-based guide to restaurants, bars, cafes and so on, but with an emphasis on how accessible they are (for example: wheelchairs). The app can also be used to call venues for bookings, or browse their websites, and it recommends nearby places with reviews.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gojee.android\">Gojee - Food &amp; Drink Recipes</a></h2> <p>\"Prepare yourself for a happy mouth explosion,\" shouts Gojee's Android app description, by way of introduction (in capitals). It's an app aggregating food and drink recipes from more than 200 foody blogs, and presenting them with lip-smacking photography in a slinky user interface.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.samsungapps.com/topApps/topAppsDetail.as?productId=G00008893310\">Zara</a></h2> <p>Samsung has bagged an initial exclusive on the official Android app from fashion house Zara. On offer is the company's catalogue, refreshed every week, with options to buy clothes, and scan barcodes when in a store for more information and alternative colours.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tripayo.tripayomobile\">Meet Travellers by Tripayo</a></h2> <p>There's a mini-blitz of social travel apps in 2012, as startups scramble to help travellers connect to friends and strangers alike for better information on destinations. Tripayo's new app is, as its name makes clear, about hooking up with fellow travellers while on your jaunts \u2013&#xa0;presumably for friendship or more, depending on the situation. Hotel and flight-bookings features are also included. </p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.interchain.radiowalla\">Radiowalla</a></h2> <p>Indian online radio service Radiowalla has launched its official Android app, offering its hand-picked selection of streaming stations in music, sports and talk genres. Some shows can be listened to on-demand, too.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.prometheusgm.thr.android\">Hollywood Reporter</a></h2> <p>Hollywood industry magazine The Hollywood Reporter has taken its app to Android, offering a feed of news, views and videos from the film, TV and music industries. Social features are also built in.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.techsmith.apps.coachseye\">Coach's Eye</a></h2> <p>TechSmith's Coach's Eye app is a very clever tool for athletes (pro or otherwise) and coaches. The idea: \"video capture with slow-motion review, drawing tools, and simple sharing\" to analyse your performance and learn to do things better, whether that's running, throwing or swinging a golf club.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ensight.android.radioalarm\">Internet Radio (Beta)</a></h2> <p>Another app that does what it says on the title. EnsightMedia's app offers 50,000 streaming radio stations drawn from Shoutcast's radio directory, with search features, a sleep timer and some skeuomorphic design touches to make it look like a vintage radio.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qz.Foneclay\">Foneclay</a></h2> <p>Android is already one of the more customisable smartphone operating systems, through its own widgets and third-party apps. Foneclay is the latest example of the latter, promising \"immersive, art-interfaces as dynamic as you are\". Including, as you'll see from its Google Play screenshots, big yellow monsters. It's a more fun take on the phone-customisation apps genre.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azumio.android.sleeptime\">Sleep Time Alarm Clock</a></h2> <p>If I had a pound for every alarm-clock app I've seen go live on Google Play, I'd be too busy browsing speedboat catalogues to write this roundup. Sadly, most of them are rubbish. Sleep Time \u2013&#xa0;Alarm Clock is one of the better ones though: a \"sleep cycle alarm clock\" that aims to detect your movements in bed using your device's accelerometer, then wake you up at the right moment to avoid grogginess.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.fingerfunk.chestburster\">Chestburster</a></h2> <p>Some fun here, of the augmented-reality-t-shirt-to-make-an-alien-burst-out-of-your-chest variety. Scan one of Fingerfunk's t-shirts and, yes, an alien will burst out of the person's chest. A novelty, yes, but a useful showcase for what's possible with technology like the Unity 3D game engine and Qualcomm's Vuforia AR platform (both used here).</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vibease.app\">Vibease - Chat and Vibrator</a></h2> <p>And a bit more fun to finish off, although \"finish off\" is perhaps not the best phrase to use in this context. Vibease promises \"soothing ambient sound and customizable vibration rhythm\", as well as a private social network for couples to... Well, make one another's smartphones buzz. The app will also work with a separate Vibease vibrator for true Android-fuelled sexytime. Not a phrase you'll be reading in this column for a while, thankfully.</p> <p>That's our selection, but what have you been using this week on your Android smartphone or tablet? Make your recommendations with a comment.</p>",
  "<p>The Guardian datablog has joined forces with <a href=\"http://civic.mit.edu/users/natematias\">J. Nathan Matias</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.media.mit.edu/\">MIT media lab</a> and data scientist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/lynn-cherny\">Lynn Cherny</a> to collect what is to our knowledge, the most comprehensive, high resolution dataset available on news content by gender and audience interest.</p> <p><strong>Why gather this data?</strong> <br>There is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/dec/06/women-representation-media\">evidence</a> that women's byline counts are consistently lower than mens throughout the UK national press. With a similar <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/05/31/men-rule-media-coverage-of-women-s-news.html\">situation</a> being observed in the US. </p> <p>It's not clear if this situation is related to audience demand or behavior in the newsroom. To give some idea of how newsrooms function the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/janemartinson\">Jane Martinson</a> makes the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2012/may/31/female-newspaper-editors\">important observation</a> that : Dawn Neesom is now the only female editor of a national newspaper in the UK. Exploring the subtle relationships between supply and demand is a good position to start to talk about how this inequality could change. </p> <p>Over the coming weeks we will be exploring a unique database of every article published by the Guardian, Telegraph, and Daily Mail in the year from July 2011 to June 2012. This was an active and varied time for news including the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london-riots\">UK riots</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/phone-hacking\">phone hacking</a> coverage. </p> <p>To give us a deeper understanding we have automatically tagged the articles with the date of publication, section, gender of author, and social popularity data from Twitter, Facebook and Google+.</p> <p><strong>How have we gathered this data?</strong><br>In the past, to measure gender in the news, researchers have counted articles by hand. In <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/dec/06/women-representation-media#\">this study</a> Kira Cochrane and a group of researchers went through seven daily newspapers, for almost a month, counting and recording the number of male and female writers. </p> <p>To take the pain out of this process and to gather larger samples with richer background information, we have turned our attention to online news. </p> <p>We used the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform\">Guardian OpenPlatform</a> to download a complete copy of the Guardian online, and Matias scraped the archives of the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/sitemaparchive/index.html\">Daily Mail</a> and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/archive/\">Telegraph</a>. </p> <p>To identify the gender we used the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/apr/25/baby-names-data\">database of baby names</a> collated by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/anna-powell-smith\">Anna Powell Smith</a> from the Office for National Statistics <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/all-releases.html?definition=tcm%3A77-28486\">data</a>. </p> <p>Using this database Matias' software classifies articles by byline as: male, female, mixed, or unknown. Most articles with unknown gender come from the newswires with a byline of \"the associated press\" or \"press association.\" A much smaller number include ambiguous names or names which aren't in the UK birth statistics. \"Unknown\" also includes a very small number of articles with empty bylines.</p> <p>A universally available measure of the popularity of the articles is the number of \"shares\" on Facebook, Twitter and Google+. This is just one measure of the impact and influence of news - by no means to only one. To get the shares we used the open source <a href=\"https://github.com/openNews/amo\">Amo software</a> by Knight-Mozilla Fellow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theCole\">Cole Gillespie</a>. Amo can fetch all of the Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ sharing information for any web address. Using this data, we can draw conclusions about the reach of women's voices and the nature of audience demand associated with each news organisations.</p> <p><strong>An introduction to our data</strong><br>In this, our first post, here is an overview of the number of articles published by each newspaper from July 2011 to June 2012: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js\"> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js\"> {\"dataSourceUrl\":\"//docs.google.com/spreadsheet/tq?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdDFqXzZFTEUzUms1ZTVVaUVDQWNIR0E&transpose=0&headers=1&range=B1%3AF4&gid=8&pub=1\",\"options\":{\"vAxes\":[{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"title\":\"Number of articles\",\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"viewWindow\":{}},{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"viewWindow\":{}}],\"title\":\"Gender in 3 Major UK Newspapers: July 2011 - June 2012\",\"booleanRole\":\"certainty\",\"animation\":{\"duration\":0},\"hAxis\":{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"viewWindow\":{}},\"isStacked\":true,\"width\":460,\"height\":276},\"state\":{},\"chartType\":\"ColumnChart\",\"chartName\":\"Chart3\"} </script> </figure>  <p>You can see the Guardian is publishing more and the gender is more regularly defined. The Daily Mail journalists frequently use \"DAILY MAIL REPORTER\" for a byline which means we are being careful when comparing data. </p> <p>Looking closer at just the opinion articles we can see the following:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395816045\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347016532183/Gender-media-008.jpg\" alt=\"Gender-media\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">gender in the media Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Opinion sections can shape a society's opinions and therefore are an important measure of women's voices in society. In his <a href=\"http://civic.mit.edu/blog/natematias/data-science-for-gender-equality-monitoring-womens-voices-in-the-news\">preliminary analysis </a>Matias notes:</p> <blockquote> <p>We have found women are more prominent in UK opinion pages than they are in American newspapers. According to Taryn Yaeger of the Op Ed Project, <a href=\"http://theopedproject.wordpress.com/2012/05/28/the-byline-survey-2011/\">women write 20% of op eds in America's newspapers</a>. Across the UK papers we studied, the rate is 26%.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here's our data showing for each newspaper the gender balance of the writers and a first look at the social networks sharing data.

  "<p>Maggie Kelly's son is the same age as the little girl at the heart of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/07/rench-alps-shooting-live-updates\" title=\"\">shooting tragedy in the French Alps</a> that has dominated the headlines and the national consciousness for the last two days.</p> <p>Just four years old, Kelly's son is usually blissfully unaware of what is going on in the world around him. But on Friday morning, when presenters on BBC Radio 4 began discussing the orphaned girl found curled under the legs of her dead mother, Kelly felt a line had been crossed.</p> <p>\"Although he wouldn't necessarily absorb what's being said in general, he is into Star Wars and superheroes, so his ears will prick up at any mention of 'shooting' and 'killing',\" said Kelly. \"He will then ask me about it. That's why, today, I talked loudly over the radio and jumped up to turn it off.\"</p> <p>Kelly is uncertain whether her response was the right one. \"I think I would always try to avoid him hearing about incidents like this one, which might make him feel frightened that something horrific might happen to him and his family. But at some point he will become of aware of all sorts of horrors,\" she said.</p> <p>\"I guess I just want to put off the inevitable loss of innocence for as long as possible, but it's hard to know whether I'm being over-protective.\"</p> <p>When faced with an unresolved tragedy as extreme as the one unfolding near Annecy, even psychologists struggle to give advice about how to explain it to children.</p> <p>Sue Minto, the head of Childline, said a parent's decision on how to react \"rests on a very fine balance\".</p> <p>\"We need to help children grow up with the confidence to take chances and be independent, but we do them a disservice if we let them believe the world is a rosy place where bad things don't happen,\" she said. \"We have a responsibility to make sure they have enough information to assess risks in the real world.\"</p> <p>Key factors to consider when deciding how, or whether, to talk to a child about such a horrific event include their ages, intellectual and cognitive abilities, emotional maturity and their general level of anxiety. These should not be underestimated, Minto said.</p> <p>The reassurance that parents give should be targeted at what their child could do in a situation of danger.</p> <p>\"Children under the age of seven are highly vulnerable. The best they could do if they're in trouble is to tell someone or try to escape,\" she said. \"These children should be told in a gentle way that this tragedy happened a long way away, that it won't happen to them, and that you are there to keep them safe.</p> <p>\"But they should also be told that&#xa0;\u2026 adults aren't always kind and can't always be trusted,\" she added. \"Children this young also need to understand that they should always listen to their instincts and seek help if they feel scared.\"</p> <p>Handling this particular event was more delicate with children between the ages of seven and nine, who would remember having been in a car and might, like the murdered family, have parked in an isolated picnic spot.</p> <p>\"You can't pretend it's not real with children of this age,\" Minto said. \"But they are old enough to understand relative risk. Give them lots of reassurance but put it in context: take the opportunity to tell them it's more likely they will be hurt if they don't take care when crossing the road.\"</p> <p>Dr Dinah Jayson, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist and the author of Understanding Children's Behaviour, said children aged around 11 were old enough for adults to proactively raise the issue. Even, she said, to use it as an opportunity for philosophical discussions.</p> <p>\"Listen to your children's fears about this specific case then widen the discussion out,\" she suggested. \"Talk to them about whether someone can commit a crime but not be a bad person. Discuss how society labels people and whether someone who is otherwise 'good' can be provoked beyond reason, or by past traumas, to do something bad. Ask them whether you can break the law for 'good' reasons, such as political beliefs.\"</p> <p>In cases such as these, when an extreme tragedy dominates the headlines for days at a time, every parent's main concern should be to prevent their child becoming morbid or stressed, Jayson said.</p> <p>\"If children are living in an atmosphere where people are talking about it in an overwrought or disturbed way, then that is what they will be influenced by,\" she said. \"The key for parents to protect their children in this, as in all situations, is for them to contain their own anxiety.\"</p>",
  "<p>A lawyer representing a Pakistani Christian girl accused of desecrating the Qur'an who was granted bail on Friday said he will not push for her to be released from jail until her security can be guaranteed.</p> <p>He claimed that Rimsha Masih, the 14-year-old accused by a neighbour of committing an act of blasphemy last month, will require an armoured vehicle and a substantial number of bodyguards to protect her.</p> <p>\"The prime concern of the defence team is her safety and her life,\" said Raja Ikram, one of the lead defence lawyers in a case that has put Pakistan's controversial blasphemy laws under intense scrutiny.</p> <p>He added: \"She is at grave risk in the sense that the people who managed this whole drama and fabricated the evidence against her most certainly wish her harm.\"</p> <p>In addition to security concerns more time is needed to arrange a surety bond of more than \u00a36,000, he said.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/07/pakistani-christian-girl-blasphemy-freed-jail\" title=\"\">Rimsha became the first person ever accused of blasphemy to win bail</a> after a morning of heated legal arguments in a hot, overcrowded courtroom in Islamabad, in large part due to the extraordinary turn of events in the case.</p> <p>Earlier this week, more than two weeks after Rimsha was first arrested, new witnesses came forward alleging she had been framed by the head of the local mosque in the impoverished neighbourhood where a Christian minority live.</p> <p>The mullah was accused by his own deputies of adding pages torn from the Qur'an to a plastic bag of burned refuse that Rimsha had been seen carrying near her home on 16 August.</p> <p>Locals said the bag contained charred sacred texts from the Qur'an. It is alleged that the mullah, Hafiz Mohammed Khalid Chishti, then added additional pages from the Qur'an in order to strengthen the evidence against her.</p> <p>People living in the neighbourhood of Mehrabadi said Chishti helped to whip up anti-Christian sentiment in the town and then publicly welcomed the mass departure of hundreds of Christians who fled for other parts of Islamabad.</p> <p>Individuals accused of blasphemy have been killed by vigilante groups in the past, including one case last year when a mob swarmed on a police station in Punjab, pulled out a suspect in a case and burned him in the street.</p> <p>Ikram said Rimsha was at risk even though he acknowledged the girl had received unprecedented support from senior Muslim clerics who spoke out in her favour and even pledged to protect her.</p> <p>Weeks after the arrest, relations between the Christian and Muslim communities in Mehrabadi are still strained.</p> <p>Earlier in the week, Muslims living near Chishti's mosque spoke of their fury at the arrest of their imam, who they insisted had been framed.</p> <p>\"The truth is Rimsha did burn our prayers,\" said Mohammad Zaman Malik, an owner of a construction business. \"She confessed and apologised in front of everyone.\"</p> <p>He said the Muslim community had been unfairly portrayed by the media and that Rimsha was fully aware of her actions: \"They say she is mentally retarded, but why would she be going house to house working if she had such a condition?\"</p> <p>Although many of the Christian families that initially fled the area have since returned, many others have come back simply to pack up and leave. They complain that they have been forced to close their tiny concrete churches \u2013 Chishti and others had long complained about the \"noise\" of their services \u2013 as well as being subject to derogatory name-calling and the refusal of some shopkeepers to sell them food.</p> <p>On Wednesday one young Christian man was stacking up the contents of three of the single-room houses made of crumbling concrete that entire families rent from Muslim landlords for about \u00a315 a month onto a small flatbed truck. It represented all of the belongings of three families, all of whom were departing for other areas of the capital.</p> <p>\"Many people are leaving,\" said Naeem Masih, a 20 year-old painter. \"Rimsha was just the tip of acrimony that has been developing for a long time. The situation may be normal for the time being but it will reoccur.\"</p> <p>The landmark decision to grant Rimsha bail came after hours of legal wrangling.</p> <p>Lawyers acting for the complainant, a man called Malik Hammad who first claimed to have spotted the girl carrying the bag of material, tried to frustrate proceedings by arguing the bail application paperwork was not in order.</p> <p>They also challenged the age of Rimsha and claimed that she did not have any mental disabilities \u2013 a long-standing claim of her defenders, many of whom also say she has Down's syndrome.</p> <p>But with the investigating officer in the case adamant that she had been deliberately framed the judge eventually decided to grant bail.</p> <p>A decision on whether she will have to stand trial will be made after officials have finished their investigation into an affair that has once again sparked intense criticism of the country's blasphemy laws.</p> <p>Critics have long said the laws, which carry the death penalty and long jail terms, are routinely abused with accusations levelled against innocent people in order to settle disputes.</p> <p>This week the chairman of the All Pakistan Ulema Council alleged Rimsha was targeted as part of a land-stealing scam intended to scare away the Christian community.</p> <p>Ali Dayan Hasan, the Pakistan director of Human Rights Watch, said the organisation welcomed the court decision and urged the government to guarantee her security.</p> <p>\"The fact is that this child should not have been behind bars at all,\" he said. \"All charges against her should be dropped and Pakistan's criminal justice system should instead concentrate on holding her accuser accountable for inciting violence against the child and members of the local Christian community.\"</p> <p>He added that the organisation hoped the case would \"lead to a considered re-examination of the law\".</p> <p>However, most analysts say reform, let alone repeal, of the decades old law is highly unlikely as the country gears up for national elections.</p>",
  "<p>The brutality of the murder of three members of a British family holidaying in the French Alps, a near fatal beating and shooting of the family's seven-year-old child and the killing of a fourth witness who happened to be cycling past has put intense pressure on the French police to find a perpetrator.</p> <p>The local prosecutor, Eric Maillaud, has described the killing of Iraqi-born Saad al-Hilli, 50, his wife, Iqbal, and her mother as an \"act of gross savagery\". However for the moment there appear to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/06/french-alps-shooting-two-girls\" title=\"\">no definitive leads</a>.</p> <p>French investigating authorities are not yet saying outright whether they believe it was a targeted or a professional killing, instead describing the way in which the killing happened as \"strange modus operandi\", which appears to mean that it is not obvious why the attack happened.</p> <p>They also say they have no real leads but plenty of theories. \"It's not that we have no idea; we have many ideas, many hypotheses, all of which are being looked at, but there are no real leads at the moment. My worry is that we may never find the killer,\" Maillaud said.</p> <p>However, there are currently four theories with some credibility, variously saying that it was a racist killing, a robbery, the consequence of a family dispute or that there was a national security connection.</p> <h2><strong>Robbery</strong></h2> <p>Earlier this year the Foreign Office warned tourists about an emerging \"pattern of incidents\" in this part of France after gangs appeared to be targeting foreign-registered cars on highways.</p> <p>On Thursday the <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/french-alps-shooting-the-mountain-bandits-who-target-brits-abroad-8112967.html\" title=\"\">Evening Standard reported</a> that there had been a series of hold-ups involving masked attackers 50 miles away. The gang tried to steal a Ford Fiesta and a Peugeot and police were investigating whether there was a link between the incidents.</p> <p>Edmund King, president of the motoring organisation the AA, said: \"There have been incidents in the south of France and around Lyon. They look for UK-registered cars then they flash their lights and perhaps point at the car's wheels. The tourists stop their car and while one gang member distracts them, another steals from their car.</p> <p>\"French police have been cracking down on these gangs but there have been isolated and organised incidents from particular gangs in particular areas.\"</p> <p>The Telegraph noted that France was much more relaxed than the UK <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/9524060/France-shooting-organised-gangs-prey-on-drivers-travelling-abroad.html\" title=\"\">about civilian gun ownership</a>.</p> <h2><strong>National security</strong><br></h2> <p>The nature of the killing has given rise to speculation about who might be able to dispatch an assassin to the French Alps. Three of the four people killed were shot through the middle of the head, and initial details seemed to suggest a degree of control to the massacre. It was not someone spraying bullets around.</p> <p>The theory was kept alive when the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2199513/French-shooting-Extraordinary-life-engineer-victim-centre-Alps-shooting.html\" title=\"\">Daily Mail claimed Saad al-Hilli had been placed under special branch surveillance in 2003</a> during the Iraq war. Philip Murphy, a neighbour of Hilli in Claygate, Surrey, was quoted by the paper as saying he thought special branch used his driveway during the war to monitor Hilli's house.</p> <p>\"I watched them [the officers] from the window and they were watching Mr al-Hilli and his brother,\" Murphy told the Mail. \"I thought they were from special branch. They would sit there all day in their parked car just looking at the house.</p> <p>\"When Mr al-Hilli came out and drove off, they would follow him. It was all very odd. I never told the family they were being watched.\"</p> <p>Scotland Yard said they would not comment, because Hilli had not been formally identified as the victim, and Surrey police had nothing to add. One Whitehall source suggested caution. In essence, these responses are neither denials nor confirmations. There is huge sensitivity in the UK, more so than in other countries, in talking about anything to do with national security.</p> <p>In 2003, members of the Iraqi community would have been of interest to security officials for a number of reasons. First, as the prospect of war with Iraq loomed, they would have been searching for anyone who may take retaliatory action. Secondly, British counter-terrorism officials were trying to get anyone with any knowledge of Islamic communities in the UK to inform. Their approach was somewhat haphazard.</p> <p>Even if security officials did monitor the Hilli family during the war, this may not mean the family was necessarily seen as a threat.</p> <p>There have also been a number of theories based around Saad al-Hilli's Iraqi ethnicity and his work \u2013 he does computer-assisted design engineering \u2013 that have led some to speculate over whether the killing was the work of an intelligence agency, or linked with one. It has been established that Hilli worked as a computer-assisted designer for the firm <a href=\"http://www2.surrey.ac.uk/mediacentre/press/2012/81472_surrey_engineers_use_games_console_technology_to_make_space_building_blocks.htm\" title=\"\">Surrey Satellites</a>, which is owned by the large defence and engineering contractor <a href=\"http://www.eads.com/eads/int/en/our-company.html\" title=\"\">EADS</a>.. On Thursday a family friend and fellow engineer, James Matthews. said Hilli was a freelancer and that the last major project he worked on was designing the galley kitchen of the new Airbus.</p> <p>The picture painted of Hilli so far by friends and neighbours is of a hard-working family man with a love of caravanning who was a respected member of the suburban Surrey community he made his home \u2013 less James Bond, more Terry Scott.</p> <h2><strong>Family feud</strong></h2> <p>French police confirmed on Friday morning that this was one of the theories they were investigating and that they were working with their British counterparts on this. It seems extraordinary that a family dispute could erupt in such a fashion \u2013 with the deaths of so many family members and witnesses in a foreign country.</p> <p>The idea could be that there may have been a paid assassin involved. However, few currently available details back up this theory.</p> <p>A neighbour of the Hillis, Jack Saltman, said he had reported a family-related problem to the police but gave few details as to what it might be. <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/french-alps-shootings-saad-al-hilli-1309482\" title=\"\">The Mirror carried the story</a> and reported Saltman as saying Saad al-Hilli mentioned \"two or three times\" over the last two months something which gave him \"cause for concern\".</p> <p>The 67-year-old told the Mirror: \"He had family in Iraq and I know he was worried about their safety and spoke to them on the phone. He told me something about a problem he had and before he left he came round and saw me and asked if I would keep an eye on his house.\"</p> <p>The Mirror's story also reported the existence of a family dispute over an inheritance \"worth more than \u20ac1.2m\". Zaid Alabdi, described as a family friend, said: \"He [Saad al-Hilli] told me he had employed lawyers and was involved in a dispute over a lot of money.\"</p> <p>The Daily Mail<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2199513/French-shooting-Extraordinary-life-engineer-victim-centre-Alps-shooting.html#ixzz25lYfMp2T\" title=\"\"> spoke to Hilli's accountant, Julian Stedman</a>, who described his accounts as \"straight up\".</p> <h2><strong>Racist killing</strong></h2> <p>The theory of a lone killer driven by psychopathic, religious or racial hatred is, perhaps, one of France's worst fears in the aftermath of the Annecy shootings.</p> <p>It would take the country back to the dark days earlier this year when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/toulouse-shootings\" title=\"\">Mohamed Merah</a>, who claimed links to Islamic extremism, went on three separate killing sprees in and around the south-western city of Toulouse.</p> <p>Merah, 23, gunned down seven people, including two young children, a rabbi and two French paratroopers, at point-blank range before police eventually shot him dead at his Toulouse flat on 22 March after a 32-hour siege.</p> <p>Although France's intelligence service had French-Algerian Merah on its radar, he was believed to have acted alone. Before he was shot dead he told police he had killed the servicemen in retaliation for the French army's involvement in Afghanistan and killed the Jewish victims in support of Palestinian Muslims.</p>",
  "<p>Perhaps a question mark should be added to the legend that greets teams clattering down the steps to take the field at Liverpool. This is Anfield? Certainly, the repercussions of Sunday's lame 2-0 home defeat by Arsenal appear to have left Brendan Rodgers's team in limbo while their manager seems to be at odds with the club's American owners.</p> <p>Rodgers stressed that Fenway Sports Group \"have been very up front and honest with me\" but he did concede: \"There are obviously one or two things we need to iron out.\" Rodgers's main beef is that having let Andy Carroll join West Ham on loan he was unable to sign another striker, Fulham's Clint Dempsey, because Fenway would not offer more than \u00a34m for the 29-year-old American.</p> <p>This has left Rodgers with only two recognised strikers, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Fabio Borini, below, their \u00a310m summer signing from Roma. Su\u00e1rez is a gifted creative influence but has yet to reproduce the regular scoring form which brought him 81 goals in 110 Dutch league appearances for Ajax. Playing up front on his own against Arsenal his expression looked even more pained than usual.</p> <p>When Liverpool are making more news off the field than on it then clearly something is going wrong and John&#xa0;W Henry as good as admitted as much in this week's open letter to the fans. \"We are still in the process of reversing the errors of previous regimes,\" he declared. \"It will not happen overnight. It has been compounded by our own mistakes in a difficult first two years of ownership.\"</p> <p>Henry continued: \"It has been a harsh education, but make no mistake, the club is healthier today than it was when we took over.\"</p> <p>Financially that may be true but supporters judge a club's health by what is happening on the pitch and at the moment, in Liverpool's case, that is not very much. Having made their worst start after three games since 1962, when they returned to the old First Division under Bill Shankly, Liverpool are in danger of becoming long-term also-rans, a prospect made even less palatable for their fans by the way Everton, perennially slow starters, have burst out of the blocks this time.</p> <p>Rodgers's skill in producing outstanding performances from his team at Swansea on modest resources may turn out to be more valuable at Liverpool than he may have anticipated. Certainly Henry does not envisage Liverpool rejoining the big spenders. \"Spending is not merely about buying talent,\" he told the supporters. \"Our ambitions do not lie in cementing a mid-table place with expensive, short-term quick fixes that will only contribute for a couple of years. Our emphasis will be on developing our own players \u2026\"</p> <p>That was the way Liverpool ran things during the era of Shankly and Bob Paisley. While they were always prepared to spend big to get the right man, and no man was better suited to that Liverpool setup than Kenny Dalglish, the foundations of the squad were nurtured from youth. Then again, Liverpool's greatest teams belonged to the time before the Bosman ruling under which the freedom of contract won by the players became a licence to ply their trade worldwide.</p> <p>Whether Henry likes it or not, this is the age of the short-term fix. Long-term planning is at the mercy of players, their agents and which clubs have the deepest pockets. Ask Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who has seen the heart of an outstanding side leave for richer pastures because Arsenal will not wreck their finances to give players bigger contracts. But at least Arsenal have retained much of the quality in the football Wenger's teams have produced, season after season, during his 16 years as manager. That much was evident in the way Liverpool were outpassed, outmanoeuvred and outthought at Anfield last weekend.</p> <p>Some of the names that have been mentioned as possible answers to Rodgers's shortage of strikers, now that the transfer window has closed, say a lot about the present poverty of Liverpool's outlook. Presumably re-signing Emile Heskey is not part of Henry's plans.</p> <p>Anfield, of course, is still picking up the pieces from Dalglish's second stint there as manager which last season saw the team suffer such a slump in home form \u2013 six league matches won, nine drawn and four lost \u2013 that their record at Anfield was comparable to 1953-54 (7-8-6) when Liverpool were relegated.</p> <p>No chance of that this time.</p> <p>Is there?</p>",
  "<p>The test question used at Xstrata's shareholders' meeting to check the electronic system was working was: do you prefer cheese fondue or chocolate fondue? A better question for chairman Sir John Bond to ask would have been: whose board has most egg on its face \u2013 Xstrata's or Glencore's?</p> <p>It's an open question since Mick Davis, Xstrata's chief executive, had claimed that a merger ratio of 2.8 times was the best that could be negotiated in \"the universe of the possible\". <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/07/glencore-delay-xstrata-merger-vote\" title=\"\">Now Ivan Glasenberg is prepared to offer 3.05 Glencore shares for every Xstrata share</a>.</p> <p>On the other hand, Glasenberg had tried to claim that the collapse of the transaction would be \"no big deal\".

The thought was that it would sanction a transaction in three or four years' time when, it hoped, Xstrata's heavy investment programme of recent years was bearing fruit. It would be a big climbdown to meet Glasenberg halfway on price. We must assume Glasenberg thinks he has the support of Qatar at 3.05 \u2013 but, as yet, there is no formal statement.</p> <p>2. <strong>Is Glasenberg prepared to go hostile if Qatar doesn't bite?</strong> There's little doubt that Glencore (which already owns 35% of Xstrata) could get to 50.1% and take control. But to force minority shareholders to sell up it would need 90% of the shares, under takeover rules. That gives the Qataris, with 12%, power to force Xstrata to remain as a listed company, with implications for Glencore's ability to consolidate cashflows (which, presumably, is the appeal of the deal). Being a minority partner in a Glencore-controlled company is not everybody's cup of tea \u2013 but Qatar Holdings moves in mysterious ways.</p> <p>3. <strong>Can Xstrata's board sanction an all-share deal that makes Glasenberg chief executive?</strong> Bond has argued until he was blue in the face that retaining Mick Davis, his chief executive, would be crucial for the future success of Glenstrata. That's the basis on which he sanctioned a bumper retention package for Davis and Xstrata's top 80 managers. But Glasenberg now wants to be chief executive. Does that mean even more cash would have to be thrown at Davis to encourage him to stay in a subordinate role? Or would Davis now be deemed surplus to requirements? The latter position would be hard for Bond and his board to adopt since the previous message to shareholders was that it was safe to take Glencore shares because Xstrata managers would still be managing Xstrata's old assets. Bond would now have to say, in effect: you'll get a few more Glencore shares, but they'll be more risky. That's a tricky sell.</p> <p>4. <strong>How on earth did Tony Blair get involved?</strong> The former prime minister, it is said, brokered the talks between Glencore and Qatar's prime minister. If that's the case, what's the point of Glencore employing a small \u2013 but expensive \u2013 army of investment bank advisers? And what fee did Blair command, as a one-man merger &amp; acquisition adviser?</p> <p>That's the lunchtime position. We'll see what the afternoon brings. Xstrata's shares have risen 8% this morning. But they still trade below the \"see-through\" price of Glencore's revised terms. They stand at about 2.8 times, suggesting the market still has serious doubts over whether the deal will happen.</p>",

Sending officials to look for violations is a common way of pressurising small businesses in Russia.</p> <p>Police initially said the concert could not take place as it was only 1km away from a monastery.</p> <p>Although the police eventually relented about the concert going ahead, organisers still fear the event could be sabotaged. A local company refused to put up posters.</p> <p>There are only a couple of big Russian groups set to play with most major stars in Russia refusing to appear or come out in support of Pussy Riot. One of the groups that will play is Televizor, who were banned in the 1980s in the Soviet Union for protest songs such as Your Daddy is a Fascist.</p> <p>In the new Pussy Riot video, three group members in balaclavas are seen abseiling down an abandoned tower block in Moscow draped in a huge banner in support of the group together with photos of Putin and the Belarussian president, Alexander Lukashenko.</p> <p>The members thank Madonna, Bjork, Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Green Day for their support for the group and vow to continue.</p> <p>\"We go on with our musical fight in Russia. Our country is dominated by evil men,\" they say, ending the video by setting fire to the huge portrait of Putin. \"These men think it is illegal to call yourself a feminist and to sing punk music.\"</p>",
  "<p>When human tragedies happen, one of the most unsettling aspects of their aftermath often concerns survivors and their future. In the case of the four-year-old girl miraculously found alive after eight hours underneath the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/07/french-alps-murder-bullet-casings?CMP=NECNETTXT8187\" title=\"\">murdered bodies of her family</a> in Annecy, France, many will wonder whether she can hope to have anything like a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/06/young-alps-shooting-victims\" title=\"\">\"normal life\"</a>.</p> <p>Psychologists are already rushing to give their prognoses and to offer suggestions for treatment. Some say she mustn't be forced to relive the horror; others recommend she be helped to confront the reality of her parents' and grandmother's deaths by being allowed to see their bodies. Having had the extraordinary misfortune to be caught up in such a horrific event and then the equally incredible luck to have survived it, she can hardly be expected to grow up unaffected. But what can the people around her do best to help her live with what's happened? Would it be better for her to remember, or to forget? What kind of remembering would be most helpful? And is forgetting even a real option? If she isn't helped, at some point, to understand and articulate her thoughts about those appalling events, surely they will be liable to erupt in some unprocessed form further down the line; things like that don't just go away.</p> <p>It's hard to imagine how someone so young might experience something so extreme and unusual. Most teenagers and adults in the modern world will have watched countless representations of violence in films and on TV and might at least have some kind of framework in place for conceptualising and describing even the most harrowing events. The British cyclist who found the bodies described the scene as being like something from a movie, presumably because this gave him a reference point from which to understand what he was seeing. But a small child, one hopes, is unlikely to have sat through the endless stories about assaults and murders that constitute mainstream entertainment. Cruelty and bloodshed won't have been \"normalised\" for them. Still, most young children show a perfect awareness of the grizzlier side of life through nightmares and waking fears of animals, strangers and monsters. More often than not the adults around them will have to work to convince them that they are safe \u2013 that bogeymen don't exist and that strange noises aren't the sign of imminent disaster (and then, when they are grown up, they can both relive and demonstrate mastery over their childish fears of immolation by watching Saw III or Wallander).</p> <p>To be so young and to have witnessed at first hand such brutality is to be robbed of all the comforting ideas that we build around ourselves and our children \u2013 that if you're good then no harm will come to you and that your family will be there to protect you. To try to re-instil such soothing fictions in a human being who's had them ripped away so forcibly may be to try to lock the stable door after the horse has bolted. Why believe in them when they've been proven so untrue? But then how to live a normal life without such placatory illusions? Should a person be persuaded that everything really can go back to normal? Or could it be more helpful to give up on any standard notion of normality?</p> <p>What exactly is a \"normal life\"? One where the person feels able to love and be loved, while also making a living? If so, there are enough abnormal lives being lived to make a mockery of the distinction. Perhaps, rather than betting everything on a return to normality, it can be far more helpful to think about ways in which people might somehow be able to give a place to experiences that can't be integrated into everyday life. Rather than trying to sew everything up \u2013 either by forgetting it or by attempting to rationalise it \u2013 it may be more true to the experience to acknowledge that certain aspects of it might never be synthesised or accepted, and to try to find ways to live with that.</p> <p>\u2022 For legal reasons, this article will not be open to further comments</p>",
  "<p>If you go down to the woods today, you'd better look out for loud youths dressed as superheroes, and a punk band, and strange, yeti-like creatures humping the trees. The Berlin-based director and choreographer <a href=\"http://www.dorkypark.org/\" title=\"\">Constanza Macras</a> is, by her own admission, \"not an outdoor person\". But this bizarre promenade experience, presented by the <a href=\"http://nationaltheatrewales.org/\" title=\"\">National Theatre of Wales</a>, brings her usually urban physical theatre company, DorkyPark, to <a href=\"http://www.flintshire.gov.uk/wps/wcm/connect/8e192d8049bc6b8ebf59bf85099857e3/Wepre_Park_Booklet.pdf?MOD=AJPERES\" title=\"\">Wepre Park</a>, one of north Wales's most evocative ancient forests. Macras's piece is inspired by the two elements of Welsh culture that struck her most forcefully: the <a href=\"http://www.mabinogion.info/\" title=\"\">Mabinogion</a>, an epic, medieval collection of Celtic mythology; and the hen parties that pour out on to the streets of Cardiff every weekend.</p> <p>You could make a case for combining the two, as both contain grisly episodes concerning the fate of a stag. But Macras rather confusingly adds to the mix a series of lectures concerning the career of the 18th-century economist <a href=\"http://www.mapforum.com/05/law.htm\" title=\"\">John Law</a>, the progenitor of the Mississippi bubble that almost bankrupted France. It climaxes in the lofty ruins of <a href=\"http://www.greatcastlesofwales.co.uk/ewloe.htm\" title=\"\">Ewloe Castle</a>, where the ensemble sing a madrigal and have a punch-up.</p> <p>As a comment on the global economic situation, alas, it feels risibly simplistic, and the experience can be trying on your patience \u2013 not to mention your feet. There's far too much time allocated to peering at interpretative dancing through the undergrowth, and when someone pronounces the dread words: \"We're going to have a bit of a workshop, so I need some volunteers,\" \u2013 all part of the finished show, it seems \u2013 you search in vain for a shortcut.</p> <p>It does have its moments, particularly as the light fades when you're obliged to pick your way around with a torch, and Macras's ensemble presents some surreal encounters.

  "<p>News International is expected to face at least 230 new compensation claims from alleged victims of News of the World phone-hacking, including former England footballer Sol Campbell.</p> <p>Other new claimants include former Atomic Kitten singer Kerry Katona, her ex husband Brian McFadden, formerly of boyband Westlife, and The Apprentice contestant Ruth Badger.</p> <p>The names were revealed at a high court case-management conference overseen by Mr Justice Vos on Friday, during which it emerged that 68 new civil claims for phone-hacking damages have now been lodged.</p> <p>Hugh Tomlinson, QC, representing phone-hacking victims, also told the high court that 395 people had now applied for disclosure of phone-hacking evidence from the Metropolitan police and up to 40 more claims were expected to be lodged by the deadline set by Vos of next Friday, 14 September.</p> <p>Tomlinson added that in addition, 124 phone-hacking claims have been accepted into the News International compensation fund.</p> <p>He said he believed the total number of new claims will be \"somewhere under 300\". The numbers for expected civil claims and people applying separately to the compensation scheme revealed at the high court on Friday suggests the final figure will be at least 230.</p> <p>These claims are in addition to more than 50 civil cases settled by News International earlier this year with victims including actors, Jude Law and Steve Coogan, singer, Charlotte Church, former deputy prime minister John Prescott and Sara Payne, the mother of murdered schoolgirl Sarah.</p> <p>It was also alleged at the high court on Friday that the News of the World hacked into the phone of a prominent criminal barrister, Kirsty Brimelow, who has acted in rape and murder trials, and Robin Winskell, a sports lawyer who has acted for premiership footballers in disciplinary trials, Fifa arbitrations and libel cases.</p> <p>Also taking action against News International is Tony Iles Blackmore, the uncle of Nadine Milroy Sloan, the woman who falsely accused former Tory MP Neil Hamilton and his wife Christine of sexual assault. His wife Gillian's phone was also allegedly hacked.</p> <p>Robbie Williams's ex-girlfriend Lisa Brash and Observer journalist Daniel Boffey are also listed as claimants, along with three other individuals \u2013 the model James Burke, and Susan Kirkham and Zoe Williams. John Blake, the former People editor who now publishes celebrity books, has also put in a claim.</p> <p>Friday's case-management hearing was the eighth organised by Vos to manage the final round of civil litigation over News of the World phone hacking.</p> <p>The judge had originally pencilled in February as the date for these cases to go to trial, but this has now been put back to some time after May because of a potential clash with criminal proceedings involving former News International executives, including Rebekah Brooks, who was chief executive and Andy Coulson, who was the editor of the News of the World.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>Over the last few months, it has been hard not to pay attention to the continuing debates, worries and speculations of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/cookies-and-web-tracking\" title=\"\">European cookie directive</a>. No matter what side of the issue you're on, one thing is for certain: it is now in effect.</p> <p>Internet advertising companies must disclose whenever they use cookies to deliver targeted advertising. European publishers are making changes quickly, <a href=\"http://econsultancy.com/us/blog/9990-the-bbc-unveils-its-eu-cookie-law-solution\" title=\"\">as evidenced by Econsultancy's roundup</a> of how sites such as the BBC and The Guardian are alerting visitors about the use of cookies. My clients talk about this issue daily, as they refocus their efforts on finding alternatives.</p> <p>I can't help but notice these conversations are missing something. There are more ways to find and target audiences than just using cookies, and many data types have existed for years. We've spent a lot of time and energy concerned about not being able to drive the Mercedes, when there's a BMW parked in the driveway next to it. Namely, I'm speaking of page-level targeting. If one of the aspects we love about user-targeting is the deep connection to the audience, you can satisfy this need without the use of cookies.</p> <p>In fact, the majority of targeted audience data providers gather information about the user based on the content of a site or page they are viewing. By targeting the page content itself, you actually have a more direct path to the user. To illustrate the point, let's say you're looking to reach consumers interested in technology and gadgets. You can use audience targeting to serve one-to-one messaging to a consumer who read an article related to technology 10 days previously, however, your reach will be limited to your ability to find that audience.</p> <p>Using page-level data, you can target 350 million people reading about technology and gadgets in a brand-safe environment, at that very moment, by buying only those relevant impressions in a real-time bidding exchange platform.</p> <p>That brings us to another strong aspect of page-level data. It has unparalleled scale, because it's consistently available on each and every impression. Every page is about something. This consistent variable also offers true apples-to-apples comparison of pages that lets buyers evaluate impressions more accurately and appropriately than ever before.</p> <p>Marrying ads contextually to relevant page-level environments is really the goal of any display campaign \u2013 it's why an advertiser would consider making a direct buy in the first place. It may be too soon to predict the direction of cookie targeting globally, but we can all agree that consumer awareness is at an all-time high.</p> <p>Industry self-regulation efforts and browser plug-ins such as <a href=\"http://www.ghostery.com/\" title=\"\">Ghostery</a> make it easier for consumers to identify that they are being targeted. I doubt the US will ever follow the EU entirely, but it's important to remember that the internet audience is a global one, and advertisers need to consider strategies to reach consumers in all markets. Audience targeting is a great tool, but it shouldn't be the only tool in an advertiser's strategy. Page-level targeting offers a scaleable and cost effective way to reach your desired audience in a world where cookies are limited.</p> <p><em>Stephen Graziano is director, </em><a href=\"http://www.peer39.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Peer39</em></a><em> business development at </em><a href=\"http://www.mediamind.com/\" title=\"\"><em>MediaMind</em></a><em>.

  "<p>Earlier this week Lyn Gardner celebrated outdoor performances that <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatreblog/2012/sep/03/piccadilly-circus-circus\">reclaim public space as a place to play</a>. As the director of <a href=\"http://hideandseek.net\">Hide&amp;Seek</a> I've been getting people to play games in public for the last five years, and in so doing, have become evangelical about the value of playing together. So I find it odd that the opportunities to do so are so restricted.</p> <p>Compare the choice we have of ways to eat together: in pretty much every high street in the country you'll find everything from the greasy spoon to the fancy restaurant. New innovations and trends as to what to eat, and how, and where, are pored over in magazines and blogs. Eating a burger has become a cultural pursuit. </p> <p>Following the closure of many of the <a href=\"http://www.gamerevolution.com/news/game-uk-stores-closing-down-11931\">Game Group stores</a> earlier this year, betting shops are now one of the few remaining places where you can play a video game on the high street. It's fun for some, sure, but it's harmful for others and a turn-off for many.</p> <p>We haven't yet paid much attention to what play can do for our minds, bodies, creativity and relationships. My belief is, when we do, we'll end up as enthusiastic and literate about the things that we play as we are about the things we eat. But we have a long way to go to become really literate about play. Games are generally regarded as both too trivial to take seriously and too complex to really understand. It's still a badge of honour with many of the culture professionals I meet to state they have never played a video game.</p> <p>This year's <a href=\"http://weekender.hideandseek.net \">Hide&amp;Seek Weekender</a> at London's Southbank Centre brings games into public spaces with the aim of encouraging everyone to start that journey \u2013 to see that as well as being great fun, they can engage your mind, get you playing with others, inspire you to see your environment in a different way. There are 36 games in the festival, involving choreographers, musicians, visual artists and writers as well as game designers, theatre-makers and technologists. There are games from Canada, Germany, the US, Denmark and the Netherlands. They're all experiments in how we can play together \u2013 this year curated with special attention to games that are as fun to watch as they are to play, bringing in audiences as part of the overall experience.</p> <p>Following the Weekender, the <a href=\"http://weekender.hideandseek.net/conference/\">Playing in Public conference</a> provides a chance for professionals from different disciplines to get together, hear from many of the games-makers at the Weekender, and listen to panels and presentations from leading thinkers. I hope that through events like these we can build a connection between ideas, cultural experimentation and what happens on our high street \u2013 that we can imagine better uses for those public spaces, supplanting betting shops not through legislation but by providing better sourced, more enjoyable and healthier alternatives.</p>",

We received personal accounts from those who had been assessed by the scheme, and had had experience of the work-related activity group (WRAG):</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/sep/03/disabled-benefits-claimants-fines-work?commentpage=4#comment-18059158\"><strong>anniebanani</strong></a> writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is disgusting.

I've been placed in WRAG, am hugely ill, no hope of going into paid work. For now, I have a tame job centre adviser who is holding things at bay. If someone else is moved onto my case and I'm required to do work-related activities, it will set my health back years. Amidst all this, I need to be able to look after my child; how am I to do this if I have to spend all of my time in bed (rather than most of it)?<br>Next year, it's DLA being swapped for PIP. If I lose the mobility component, I'll lose my wheelchair accessible van. If I lose the personal care component, which looks almost certain, then that's the end. I'll lose the personal assistance that I've had for the past 15 years, won't be able to keep my home functioning, won't be able to care for my child any longer. Truly, there's hardly anything left now. No security, no health, no place in this society. In 30 years disability rights work, I have never felt so on the margins, despised or threatened, and still it gets worse.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18058644\"><strong>fivemack</strong></a> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I would be entirely happy with this if benefits were raised for everyone else by the amount of the fine - that is, pay everyone \u00a399 a week and an explicitly-labelled extra \u00a371 to those compliant with WRAG, so the fine would be a removal of discretionary spending money. It's not as if the present benefits level is picked to be generous - I don't think anyone would argue that it's anything more than the least possible to avoid total destitution - so taking fines out of it breaks the Magna Carta requirement of 'no fine shall be levied on him to his utter ruin'.</p> <p>You can't ethically apply financial sanctions to people whose only income brings them to a bare level of sustenance; this is a recipe for making criminals of the strong and corpses of the weak. If you wish to punish benefit claimants, I think you have to explicitly reinstate the workhouse: provide secure accommodation and provide the work there. Doing this in a way that doesn't violate every human rights code in the book is a lot more expensive than paying them benefit, so there'd be no temptation to do it for financial reasons.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18058564\"><strong>bendyleopard</strong></a> writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Obviously due to being on ESA in the first place, many people have fluctuating illnesses or conditions.</p> <p>Who will be deciding what constitutes a \"good enough\" reason?

  "<p>In one of the world's most combustible parliaments, MPs had better watch out. A putative new member is coming who can do more than look after himself. They call him Dr Ironfist and for good reason: Vitali Klitschko is a heavyweight boxing champion, the first ever to hold a PhD \u2013 and not a man to pick a fight with.</p> <p>After two decades in the ring, the 41-year-old is on his way to perhaps the most bruising challenge of his life \u2013 taking on President Viktor Yanukovych and the dominant elite of Ukraine's corrupt political system.</p> <p>With elections next month and some expecting Klitschko to hang up his gloves after a fight against Manuel Charr this weekend, the boxer appears poised for that most enigmatic of transformations: sports star to politician.</p> <p>\"We are trying to make politics more open,\" Klitschko said in an interview with the Guardian. \"It became a Ukrainian tradition to make decisions behind closed doors [but] \u2026 we are trying to apply European standards in politics.\"</p> <p>Having dabbled in local politics for several years, Klitschko has jumped into the ring of national politics and his aptly named party Udar (meaning \"punch''). The party is emerging as a third force in Ukrainian politics, with about 11% support \u2013 sufficient to secure parliamentary seats and shake up the established parties of Yanukovych and the jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.</p> <p>His supporters are known in Ukraine as the \"disappointed\" \u2013 people who don't believe in the authorities or the opposition and feel bitterly let down by the failure of the 2004 Orange revolution to bring lasting change.</p> <p>Klitschko, who spent years living and training in Germany, says he takes its political system as an example.</p> <p>\"I'm very happy to cooperate with the [German chancellor Angela Merkel's] Christian Democratic Union (CDU),\" he said. \"And we are trying to build the same structure for our party.\"</p> <p>When speaking to journalists, Klitschko can deftly switch from Ukrainian to Russian, English or German, a rare quality for a Ukrainian politician. To prove openness he personally announced the list of his party's candidates during the recent party congress. \"Now we have pretty good support from the people. We are the number three party in Ukraine and we are number one in growth of the rating,\" he said.</p> <p>Political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko said Klitschko's political rise was because he was someone people can be proud of and a Ukrainian who succeeded abroad. \"People expect that he could do something like this here, that he would bring part of Germany into this country,\" Fesenko said. Klitschko has also managed to maintain his reputation without falling into any significant scandal during six years in politics.</p> <p>Some observers, however, say Klitschko may be backed by the Ukrainian tycoons, pointing out that several names on his party list have links to the authorities. Klitschko denies these allegations, saying he personally covers a large part of his party's expenses. Klitschko started his political career in 2006 in the Kiev local elections, becoming a member of the city council and head of a bloc in his name. He stood in the elections for Kiev mayor in 2006 and 2008, but lost both times to Leonid Chernovetsky.</p> <p>In 2010 he announced the creation of Udar (the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform). Klitschko negotiated with various parties for a coalition in the parliamentary elections but then decided to go his own way, sparking criticism from the opposition camp. Klitschko has said he would be ready to co-operate with the Tymoshenko-led opposition in a future parliament and could even withdraw his candidates from competition in the local districts if other opposition candidates had more chance to win.</p> <p>Big-hitting opposition figures found places in Klitschko's list, including a former chief of the SBU secret service, Valentyn Nalyvaichenko, who came to Udar after leaving the party of former president Viktor Yushchenko.</p> <p>Also on Klitschko's list is the Ukrainian novelist Maria Matios, an important figure in the country and a heroine for the more nationalist-inclined. He said he was an admirer of her books.</p> <p>Russian is Klitschko's first language but he surprisingly stepped in to the controversy over the protection of Ukrainian after a language law strengthening the role of Russian was passed in July. The boxer suffered from teargas in clashes between opponents of the law and the police.</p> <p>But what of the temptations for a professional boxer sitting in the Ukrainian parliament, a combustible chamber given to occasional bouts of fisticuffs? Here, Dr Ironfist is clear enough, though fellow MPs might not want to take any chances. \"I never use my skills outside the ring and hope I will never do that,\" he said.</p> <p>Klitschko said politics and sport require the same skills, such as willpower, responsibility and teamwork. \"I'm a big expert in boxing, but in politics I'm a beginner, so I try to use other people's experience,\" he said. \"I read books, I'm not afraid to ask for advice.\"</p> <p>Fesenko said Klitschko's simultaneous sporting and political careers have delayed his development as a political leader. \"He hasn't fully become a politician,\" the analyst said, adding Klitschko still lacked the skills of political debate, which he would develop faster if he stopped boxing.</p> <p>Klitschko refused to say if he was planning to leave professional boxing after the parliamentary elections, although in May he wrote on his Facebook page that he was intending to hang up his gloves.</p> <p>After leaving sport, Klitschko may aim at another political target \u2013 the presidency. \"Many people want to be the president, many people. But it's not enough. If some candidate doesn't have support of people it's no more than a wish,\" he said.</p> <p>But Klitschko is cautious about the chances of him standing in 2015 when the next Ukrainian presidential elections are to be held. \"If we come a little bit closer to 2015, I'll be ready talk about this more,\" he said. \"Now we are concentrating our work on the parliamentary elections.\"</p> <h2>The Shevchenko connection</h2> <p>Sportsmen turned politicians do not generally have a good record (Manny Pacquiao, Imran Khan, George Weah to name a few). But it's still a popular retirement choice for athletes nearing the end of their competitive careers.</p> <p>Klitschko is not even the only Ukrainian making the switch. The country's best-known footballer, Andriy Shevchenko, has recently announced his intention to go into politics.</p> <p>Shevchenko is friends with Klitschko \u2013 but is not joining his party because having \"two great sportsmen in one party would be too many\".</p> <p>Klitschko appeared baffled by Shevchenko's move. \"I know Andriy very well. I spoke to him about politics and he never showed interest to it.\" \"I'm very scared if somebody tries to use him [Shevchenko],\" he said. \"It would be a disaster for his name, for his reputation.\"</p>",
  "<h2>1) Scotland 0-1 England (British Home Championship/World Cup qualifier, April 1950)</h2> <p>The qualification process for the 1950 World Cup was an across-the-board farce, requiring only the addition of a frustrated housewife, a pair of loose-fitting trousers and a wardrobe to elevate the process into a viable stage venture. Syria travelled to Turkey, lost 7-0, and dispatched the toys from the pram in a parabolic frenzy, exiting stage right before a return leg could be played. Turkey automatically advanced to a second stage against Austria, who also withdrew, handing the Turks a free pass to the finals. At which point Turkey bailed out themselves, leaving Fifa to offer the spot to Portugal, who had already been knocked out by Spain. But the Portuguese decided they couldn't be bothered any more, and politely declined. Fifa's planned 16-team jamboree would be one participant short.</p> <p>The plot was scarcely less ludicrous in south America, where Argentina showed no interest in reaching a finals in Brazil: relations between the two countries had soured after a couple of matches in 1946 and 1947 during which Argentinian legs were snapped like breadsticks while Brazilian jowls were vigorously biffed into red-raw ribbons by way of response. With Peru and Ecuador also throwing it in before a ball had been kicked, no matches whatsoever were required to ascertain the Conmebol contingent. Meanwhile in Asia, Burma, Indonesia and the Philippines all sacked it off early doors, leaving India with a free run. But the prohibitive expense of getting to Brazil \u2013 coupled with a Fifa diktat insisting their barefooted team play in boots \u2013 meant the Indians too eventually opted out. Fifa were now down to 14 teams for their grand shebang.</p> <p>But back in Europe, the best was yet to come. Fifa, very generously, had offered places to the top two finishers in the 1950 Home Championship. Given the state of Wales and Ireland at the time, this was effectively a formal invitation to England and Scotland. But the Scottish FA \u2013 confidence bolstered by a wholly unexpected victory at Wembley in 1949 in which Morton goalkeeper Jimmy Cowan single-handedly saw off Stan Mortensen, Jackie Milburn, Tom Finney and Stanley Matthews \u2013 haughtily announced that they would only accept the invite if they won the championship.</p> <p>There was only ever one way this was going to pan out. Scotland trounced the Irish 8-2 in Belfast, then beat Wales at Hampden Park. The results meant the Scots had earned a berth in the 1950 World Cup, sure as they were of at least second place even if defeated by England in the last match at Hampden. Furthermore, a draw against England would be enough to ensure they had at least one hand on the championship trophy, because although England had scored more goals in seeing off Wales and Ireland themselves, nobody bothered with that sort of thing in those days.</p> <p>Scotland were considered narrow favourites, even though they'd not beaten England at Hampden since 1937. The English were genuinely fearful of Rangers right-winger Willie Waddell, and unsure of getting any change from the Scottish defence, marshalled brilliantly by Willie Woodburn (later to be banned indefinitely for his occasional habit of sticking the nut on opposing players who offended his sensibilities). \"If Bentley loses his colleagues in trying to elude the Scottish half-backs,\" previewed the Manchester Guardian, \"Scotland should win narrowly.\"</p> <p>Sure enough, it was Bentley who got clear of Woodburn to score the only goal on 63 minutes, although Willie Bauld of Hearts did manage to hit the bar. As, it would appear, did some of Scotland's supporters after the game. \"Glasgow took the blow with fortitude,\" reported Donny Davies of this paper. \"Long before the midnight excursion trains were due to leave, the assembly hall of the Central Station was in an uproar. Informal bottle parties reeled and staggered across the hall, bandying chaff, blending choruses, and generally fighting the battle all over again. The English trippers, secure in the knowledge that no amount of Celtic eloquence could scrub out the result \u2026 took refuge in compassion. What the Scottish selectors will do remains to be seen. Rumour had it that they had gone into hiding.\"</p> <p>Scotland's captain, George Young of Rangers, begged the SFA to change their mind, and allow the team to travel to Rio. Despite \u2013 or perhaps as a result of \u2013 having England captain Billy Wright at his side also pleading Scotland's case, George Graham refused to budge. England travelled to Brazil alone, although look what happened there.</p> <p>All of which left Fifa with a lop-sided tournament of 13 teams. Having already drawn the groups, they didn't bother restructuring the finals, and so two groups of four, one group of three, and a group of two fought for a place in a final pool of four which made little sense \u2013 yet produced the greatest denouement in the history of All Football. So a complete casserole of codswallop from beginning to end, and yet the 1950 World Cup remains, by some distance, the greatest World Cup of all time. For Brazil's next trick in two years' time? Fifa should just pick 13 names out of a hat and go with the flow. Whoops, there goes that tournament!</p> <h2>2) Scotland 4-2 Spain (World Cup Uefa Group Nine, May 1957)</h2> <p>Still, perhaps Graham had done Scotland some sort of queer favour. The SFA wised up \u2013 well, OK, but it's all relative \u2013 and four years after that particular debacle they accepted an offer to compete in the 1954 tournament as a result of coming second in that year's home championship. They travelled to Switzerland, and had their arses skelped 7-0 by the world champions Uruguay, their manager, Andy Beattie, having packed his suitcase and fled after losing the first match against Austria.</p> <p>However another tournament on, and here came proof that Scotland could compete with the big boys. This was their first proper qualification game, in a group outside a home championship, and it looked like a mismatch rather than a match. The Scots had never played Spain before, and you could have forgiven their players for Doing A Beattie before the game. The home side consisted of players from modest clubs such as Clyde, Charlton Athletic, Blackpool and Second Division Liverpool. Spain were packed to the gunnels with stars from Barcelona and Real Madrid, the latter recently having brought themselves to British attention with a televised win over Manchester United in the new European Cup. Their forward line featured Ladislao Kubala, Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Francisco Gento. Time to dip into the DC Thomson book of old-school exclamations: jings, crivvens, help ma boab.</p> <p>But a confident Scotland \u2013 who had to do without Alex Parker of Falkirk, the full-back having taken ill as a result of jabs given to him by the army \u2013 started strongly. Jackie Mudie opened the scoring after 22 minutes, Scotland giving the Spanish woodwork a thorough examination. Sammy Baird of Rangers hit the post, forcing keeper Antoni Ramallets to clear for a corner. From the set piece, Mudie hit the crossbar, but then headed home the rebound. Kubala bundled home a scrappy equaliser four minutes later, but Scotland regained the lead just before half-time when Tommy Ring of Clyde was bullied by the not-so-wee Ferran Olivella of Barcelona; John Hewie smacked home the resulting penalty.</p> <p>Spain upped their game, turning the screw with some \"unceremonious tackling\", according to the Guardian, but no little skill as well: Di Stefano released Su\u00e1rez with a backheel for a second equaliser just after the restart. The Spanish attempted to assert their authority \u2013 Younger's hands were warmed by a stinger from Gento, Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez put the ball in the net from an offside position, and \"the visitors again resorted to rough tackling\" \u2013 but Mudie scored again on 70 minutes after Bobby Collins had ripped the Spanish back line apart, and the Blackpool striker completed his hat-trick with 10 minutes remaining, tiki-taka-ing in pretty triangles with Gordon Smith before securing the victory.</p> <p>Spain would get their own back on Scotland a fortnight later, belting them 4-1 in Madrid, but their campaign had already been compromised by a draw with Switzerland. Scotland made no such mistake, beating the Swiss home and away, albeit in what would become their trademark nervous style, requiring a late offside goal at Hampden to make it to the finals at Spain's expense.</p> <h2>3) West Germany 3-2 Scotland (World Cup Uefa Group Seven, October 1969)</h2> <p>This was last chance saloon time for the Scots, although they hadn't done too much wrong in their attempts to qualify for Mexico 70. Drawn in a group with Austria, Cyprus and the 1966 runners-up West Germany, Bobby Brown's side had beaten the Austrians at home thanks to goals from Denis Law and Billy Bremner, put 13 goals past Cyprus home and away, and salvaged a late draw against the Germans at Hampden through Bobby Murdoch. By the time Scotland travelled to Hamburg for the return fixture, West Germany had recorded wins in all their other games, beating both Austria and Cyprus twice. But this impressive record had been gained with a modicum of fortune: Gerd M\u00fcller had scored an 88th-minute winner at home against Austria, and a 90th-minute winner away in Cyprus. What it all meant was, Scotland \u2013 who were still required to play (and win) in Austria \u2013 had to avoid defeat against Germany in order to keep at least hope of a play-off alive.</p> <p>\"Scotland defied all the conventions of modern international football,\" reported the legendary David Lacey after a tumultuous defeat that is remembered now principally for Tommy Gemmell toe-punting Helmut Haller up the jacksie in the cartoon style, arguably the greatest foul in the history of association football. But the match was a classic in its own right, Scotland giving it a proper go against much-fancied opposition. They took the lead through Jimmy Johnstone after three minutes and, though Klaus Fichtel equalised just before half time, did not lose heart. They hit the bar twice before M\u00fcller did what he did on the hour, and then drew level themselves through Alan Gilzean. Bremner, Eddie Gray and Peter Cormack were all mentioned in Lacey's dispatch as \"excelling in attack \u2026 switching the ball around effectively \u2026 Scottish chances came and went, and for every opening created by the Germans, the Scots would make three and waste two of them \u2026 these misses proved too costly.\"</p> <p>Haller was to do for the Scots. It was his through ball that released Reinhard Libuda to convert the winner on 79 minutes, and his clip on Gemmell's heels in the dying minutes that caused the big man to lose the place completely and execute a divine swish of retribution. Gemmell was sent off, the Scots destined to sit out the World Cup yet again. As things panned out, a demoralised team lost their final match against Austria anyway, but it's often forgotten now just how close they came to knocking out one of the greatest international sides of all time. Mexico 70 would have been a poorer tournament without the goals of M\u00fcller, the bravery of Franz Beckenbauer, Germany's matches against England and Italy and all that. But what would you have given to see Gemmell get stuck in against Pel\u00e9, Tost\u00e3o, G\u00e9rson et al?</p> <h2>4) Scotland 3-1 Czechoslovakia (World Cup Uefa Group Seven, September 1977)<br>5) Wales 0-2 Scotland (World Cup Uefa Group Seven, October 1977)</h2> <p>Scotland's most notorious appearance in a World Cup final was their ill-fated trip to Argentina in 1978, so it's appropriate that the qualifying campaign that got them there was one to match. Scotland had made it to the 1974 finals with a win at Hampden over Czechoslovakia in 1973, and really needed to repeat the trick four years later if they were to pip the Czechs and Wales to the 1978 event. Scotland had started the group slowly, losing 2-0 to the Czechs in Prague, Antonin Panenka scoring his first international goal since <em>that</em> penalty secured the European Nations Cup for his country four months earlier. The Scots then scraped past Wales, an own goal from Crystal Palace's Ian Evans deciding a poor match. With Wales having dispatched the Czechs 3-0 in Wrexham, Scotland really needed a similar result at Hampden, with an away fixture against Wales still to come.</p> <p>The Czechs may have been reigning European champions, and had that two-goal win in Prague to remember, but they were at something of a disadvantage when their Hampden visit came around. Mainly because they had to travel to the match by rail, as a result of an air strike. The last leg of the journey, across Britain, was of course the most hellish, the team having to take an overnight train from London to Glasgow. Needless to say, there were no sleeping facilities. They arrived, not to put too fine a point on it, knackered.</p> <p>Scotland took full advantage. \"Playing aggressive, well coordinated football before an ecstatic Hampden Park crowd,\" reported our man Lacey, \"Scotland shrugged off some early threatening gestures from Czechoslovakia and conquered them from the air in the loftiest fashion.\" Joe Jordan was the hero, nutting in a corner on 19 minutes, then clattering goalkeeper Pavol Michalik in a 50-50 aerial challenge to set up Asa Hartford for a tap-in. Events in the skies were truly conspiring to jigger the Czechs, and a spot of head tennis between Gordon McQueen and Sandy Jardine set up Kenny Dalglish for a third. Miroslav Gajdusek skelped in a late swerving drive, but the Scots held on without too much drama. \"Bring on Wales,\" the crowd chanted, before going home to wonder exactly how far Scotland could go in Argentina.</p> <p>They had to beat Wales first to guarantee their place, of course. Scotland were the hot favourites. They were the form horses, having won the 1977 Home Championship in some style \u2013 infamously busting up Wembley in the process \u2013 then played well on a summer tour to South America. And then the 3-1 win over the European champions. Wales, by comparison, had drawn 0-0 twice with Kuwait. Also, the Welsh FA had decided to stage the match at Anfield, eschewing home advantage in search of extra coin. The game effectively became another home match for the Scots, so many supporters travelled south to fill Liverpool's ground. \"This was supposed to be Wales's home game,\" reported Lacey, \"but the rueful look on the face of Terry Yorath, the Welsh captain, as he led his side out to noise that beat like fists on the eardrums said much.\"</p> <p>Wales started slowly, with Scotland winning a series of early corners. The Scots were denied a penalty kick when Joey Jones handled \u2013 Lacey called it a \"legitimate\" claim \u2013 and could easily have had another as Kenny Dalglish claimed to have been felled in the area by David Jones. But their luck was not in. Yet. Wales came back into the match, and on the hour should have gone ahead as John Toshack went clear with only Alan Rough to beat. But the Partick Thistle keeper turned the Welsh striker's shot on to the bar, and the tide turned once again. With 12 minutes to go, Willie Johnston sent a ball into the Welsh area. David Jones went up to challenge a header with Jordan, who punched the ball away. The referee, however, was convinced it was Jones who had handled, and pointed to the spot. After a full and frank exchange of views between the official and several Welsh players, Don Masson coolly slotted the penalty away, and Scotland had one foot in the finals.</p> <p>With five minutes to go, an unquestionably legal goal settled the argument, Dalglish heading a Martin Buchan centre home. Scotland were there, and Wales were out. \"None of my players handled it,\" sighed Wales boss Mike Smith after the game. \"There was a lot of different opinions in the dressing room about what happened.\" Jordan's take was that \"as far as I know, the ball did not touch me, I did not feel it, and was surprised when the penalty was given\". Ally MacLeod added: \" I think we should have had a penalty earlier. You lose some, you win some.\" Sensible words from the Scotland manager. They would be in short supply over the following months, as he whipped the country up into an unfortunate lather.</p> <h2>6) Scotland 2-0 France (World Cup Uefa Group Five, March 1989)</h2> <p>\"Scotland always qualify,\" joked Billy Connolly during his critical high-water mark An Audience With Billy Connolly, as he tried to recall the year he had performed for the Scottish squad as they relaxed ahead of a World Cup. It was a quip that raised a laugh in the mid 1980s, when Scotland did exactly that, but it would get a different kind of giggle now. Scotland haven't troubled a major finals since reaching the 1998 World Cup, their sixth appearance in seven attempts, during which they'd also finally made the European Championship finals, not once but twice. Salad days, even if they never did too much when they eventually got there.</p> <p>Unquestionably the side's greatest qualification victories in recent years came during the race for Euro 2008. They registered a surprise Hampden win over World Cup runners-up France, Gary Caldwell scrambling home, then won in Paris, James McFadden's long-range stunner silencing Thierry 'Tinytears' Henry, who had ungraciously issued some back-at-ours threats immediately after the final whistle at Hampden. Needless to say, France made it to the finals at Scotland's expense anyway, so Henry had the last laugh, but you've got to enjoy the good times when you can.</p> <p>It wasn't the first time Scotland had bothered the French in qualifying, though. Back in 1989, Michel Platini's team were favourites to escape from a group also containing the Scots, Yugoslavia, Norway and Cyprus. Scotland weren't supposed to be a threat at all, struggling for form under Andy Roxburgh, the SFA window-cleaner (Connolly again). But while Roxburgh's side weren't a totally convincing proposition, they were grinding out results \u2013 a 2-1 win in Norway had been followed by a 1-1 draw at Hampden against much-fancied Yugoslavia \u2013 and were expected to win their third game in Cyprus.</p> <p>They did that, but only just, going 2-1 down before Richard Gough scored twice, the second seven minutes into injury time. The close scrape seemed to galvanise Scotland as France came to town. \"They could be skinned for skill,\" worried our man Patrick Glenn ahead of the game, noting an opposing teamsheet teeming with star names: Jean-Pierre Papin, Laurent Blanc, Patrick Battiston, Manuel Amoros, Franck Sauz\u00e9e. But Scotland were up for the battle. After 29 bruising minutes, Maurice Johnson intercepted an Ally McCoist drive and guided the ball past Jo\u00ebl Bats. He added a second on 52 minutes, heading straight at \u2013 and through \u2013 the hapless Bats.</p> <p>It was the decisive blow in the campaign. Scotland stumbled over the line, following up with a 2-1 struggle over Cyprus, defeats in Yugoslavia and France (who had by now called Didier Deschamps and Eric Cantona into the team) and a nervy 1-1 draw at home to Norway which saw them seal their place in Italy. Scotland had broken a world record \u2013 they had become the first country to successfully negotiate five successive qualification processes. Not bad for the window cleaner. But then, Scotland always qualify. Don't they?</p>",

The army has 67 of the aircraft in total, but the number being used in Afghanistan is a closely guarded secret.</p> <p>Prince Harry has wanted to return to the country ever since his first tour in 2008 ended in farce when an agreed \u2013 but controversial \u2013 media blackout was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/mar/10/pressandpublishing.television\" title=\"\">inadvertently broken by an Australian magazine</a> and he was rushed back to Britain for his own safety.</p> <p>Once he successfully completed his 16-month training in February this year, the Ministry of Defence made it clear there was every likelihood the prince would return to Afghanistan as part of normal duties, and probably before the end of the year.</p> <p>Though critics have raised concerns that his presence in Afghanistan could encourage insurgents to target both him and his colleagues, and have accused the MoD of putting good PR before common sense, commanders believe Harry's new role, and the base from where he will fly, will offer him and those around him adequate security.</p> <p>The UK has not lost any Apache helicopters during the campaign against the insurgents, and Camp Bastion is generally regarded as safe.</p> <p>On this deployment the MoD decided again to work with the UK's major media organisations, including the Guardian, but this time to publicise it rather than keep it secret.</p> <p>An agreement involving 800 news outlets allows the media to report on the prince's activities, as long as the stories do not compromise \"operational security\". Editors have agreed to act responsibly and to inform the MoD when any potential issues arise.</p> <p>At the end of his tour, the MoD is expected to release pooled footage of the prince on duty and an interview. It will be given to those organisations that have stuck to the deal.</p> <p>Given the prince's proclivity for buffoonish behaviour, the military knows that publicising his deployment is a potentially risky strategy.</p> <p>It is only three weeks since the most recent embarrassment, when Harry was photographed naked at a private party in Las Vegas on what appears now to have been a last drunken \"hurrah\" with friends before his deployment.</p> <p>On Thursday, the Press Complaints Commission <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/sep/06/harry-naked-pictures-pcc\" title=\"\">concluded that an investigation into the Sun's decision to publish nude photos of Prince Harry would be inappropriate</a> at this time.</p> <p>However, the prince, who will celebrate his 28th birthday in less than two weeks, is a popular figure in the armed forces, and personnel serving in Afghanistan leaped to his defence during the most recent furore, posting naked photos of themselves on Facebook.</p> <p>The army's top brass also believe it inconceivable that Capt Wales, who is now considered to be responsible enough to take on royal duties on his own, would repeat \"in theatre\" the kind of high jinks and misjudgments that have drawn criticism in the past.</p> <p>The prince has been training for the tour at the army's Wattisham airfield in Suffolk, home to the 3 Regiment, Army Air Corps. His co-pilot, who has not been named, has been with him since the spring and will accompany him throughout the tour.</p> <p>When he qualified on the Apache, the prince was awarded the prize for being \"best front-seat pilot\" \u2013 an accolade to \"mark out the student whose overall performance during the course is assessed as the best amongst his peer group\".</p> <p>Lieutenant Colonel Tim de la Rue, deputy commander of the Joint Aviation Group (JAG), which provides helicopter support to Nato forces, said: \"Captain Wales is a serving soldier and a qualified Apache pilot having completed the Apache conversion to role course earlier this year.</p> <p>\"As such, and after further flying experience, he has deployed along with the rest of the squadron as part of a long-planned and scheduled deployment to provide support to Isaf and Afghan forces operating in Helmand.\"</p> <p>Captain Jock Gordon, commander of the JAG, said: \"Working alongside his colleagues in the squadron, he will be in a difficult and demanding job and I ask that he be left alone to get on with his duties and allowed to focus on delivering support to coalition forces on the ground.\"</p> <p>David Cameron's official spokesman declined to say whether the prime minister had been consulted on Harry's deployment, saying only: \"It is an operational decision. We wouldn't comment on an operational matter.\"</p> <h2>What will Harry do in Afghanistan?</h2> <p>After more than 18 months learning to fly one of the world's deadliest helicopters, Prince Harry will soon put his training into practice.</p> <p>The Apache is used in a number of roles in Afghanistan but all revolve around its devastating firepower, including laser-guided Hellfire missiles and wing-mounted aerial rockets.</p> <p>Harry, who has described the aircraft as \"awesome\", will act as the co-pilot gunner operating its weapons from the front seat, while his co-pilot will sit behind him.</p> <p>Missions will involve supporting ground troops who have come under attack from Taliban insurgents. The weapons can target buildings being used for cover by the Taliban, reducing them to rubble. And for combat in the open, the aircraft's 30mm chain gun can be controlled from the gunner's helmet-mounted display.</p> <p>Other missions include providing escort cover for aircraft, usually RAF Chinooks, that may be carrying troops or equipment around Afghanistan.</p> <p>The Apache can operate in most weather and at night, so can be used to gather intelligence in many conditions, including the harsh Afghan winters.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 September 2012.

  "<p>Stephen Ferris is one of those dynamic types who regularly makes fans and coaches sit up in surprise. Usually though, it's something explosive on the field with Ireland or Ulster that commands attention, not his thoughts. However, the most recent of many Ferris memories came when the flanker was asked for his best moment in rugby. The obvious answer would have been doing the grand slam with Ireland or possibly a great Heineken Cup moment; perhaps last season's all-Irish semi-final when Ulster went to Limerick and beat Munster.</p> <p>It was one of those great European days, but obviously not at the front of the queue in the Ferris's memory bank. Instead he went for his time with the 2009 Lions \u2013 and the impact of the answer made all the more powerful as Ferris's tour lasted just a couple of warm-up games. From memory, he was injured in training and was back home by the time we flew into Durban for the first Test.</p> <p>However, being a Lion for a fortnight \u2013 training and living cheek by jowl with guys who normally knock 10 bells out of each other \u2013 was enough. And I can understand why. Also, without making this sound like a job application, I can understand why some of the game's great names such as Gerald Davies and Andy Irvine are so wedded to the cause.</p> <p>Quite simply, being on tour with the Lions is a one-off. In Olympic terms imagine Team GB, but with the whole of Ireland included. For close on a century and a half there has been nothing like it, save possibly the Ryder Cup, and look what emotions that sparks.</p> <p>All of which brings me to this week's confirmation that Warren Gatland will lead next summer's Lions in Australia and any lingering doubts about whether a New Zealander is the right man to be in charge of an English, Irish, Welsh and Scots collective. My answer would be to ask any doubter to name a better northern hemisphere coach.</p> <p>OK, Warren was a New Zealand player and still loves reliving Waikato's victory over the 1993 Lions. But since retiring in 1995 he's coached Galwegians, worked with Leinster and Connacht before coaching Ireland, spent four seasons with Wasps and been in charge of Wales since 2007. Save for a brief and successful spell with Waikato, he's been here, and has two grand slams, a Heineken Cup, three Premierships and other assorted European and Anglo-Welsh silverware for his labours. But probably just at important as his pedigree is that his selection ensures the continuity needed if the Lions are to get anywhere near being a success.</p> <p>In 2009 Warren worked under Ian McGeechan (now Sir Ian) and knows how difficult it was to pull all the four strands together in such a short time. Then, though, we had a week together before flying out. This time it will be worse. Forty-eight hours after the Premiership and Pro12 grand finals, the two showpieces of the domestic game, Gatland's Lions check in at Heathrow. It could be that the first time the squad gets together is for the farewell dinner, and those potential Lions playing in France are going to be faced with difficult questions.</p> <p>Last time, Nathan Hines decided to put the Lions before Perpignan and Warren is in France this weekend talking to guys such as Gethin Jenkins, now with Toulon and not Cardiff Blues as he was in 2009, to remind them that the French final clashes with the opening Lions fixture, against the Barbarians in Hong Kong. Warren has already made it crystal clear that he's prepared to take the hard decisions.</p> <p>He also suggested that the selectors are likely to pay more attention to performances by England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland against the southern hemisphere sides in the upcoming autumn Tests than those in the Six Nations, after which the squad, probably of around 35, is named.</p> <p>There are a pile of issues to be thought through. For example, Warren will also have to compensate for the reduction in training time caused by the time difference and television's consequential demands that the Tests are played at night.</p> <p>Considering how much everyone concerned loves the Lions, and how much the bank balances of countries such as Australia are swollen by their tours, it's remarkable that life is made so difficult for an idea that comes alive once every four years. Maybe that's why it's so much fun.</p>",
  "<p>Based on a true story, <strong>Untouchable </strong>is the feel-good comedy that has taken the world by storm. </p> <p>This award-winning comedy charts the story of the unlikely friendship between wealthy millionaire Phillip (Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet) who was left a quadriplegic after a paragliding accident, and his street smart ex-con carer Driss (Omar Sy). Inspiring, heart-breaking and at times outrageously funny, Untouchable follows their journey of self-discovery as they confront their fears together. The pair who, on the surface seem to be worlds apart, find a camaraderie rooted in honesty and humour in what is being billed as one of the must-see films of 2012.

  "<p>Recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/02/scandal-mubarak-regime-millions-assets-uk\" title=\"\">media reports</a> revealed that the UK has done considerably less than it should and could have done to locate, freeze and facilitate repatriation of assets stolen by former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak and his entourage.</p> <p>This is not for lack of opportunity. Indeed, it seems that with little effort journalists were able to identify and locate valuable real estate and other assets belonging to members of the former regime.</p> <p>They even found that one of Mubarak's inner circle was allowed to register a new business despite being on the <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/public_notice_egypt_220311.pdf\" title=\"\">UK Treasury sanctions list</a>. Assuming that the specialist public institutions in the UK have similar if not better tools at hand for investigating such dealings, this tells us something about the true level of political will in the UK in this matter.</p> <p>Some countries have acted much faster and more vigorously, in particular Switzerland, which froze Mubarak assets within just half an hour of his resignation, has publicly communicated this and is actively engaged with the Egyptian authorities to line up necessary mutual legal assistance.</p> <p>On the other hand, the situation in other likely hiding places of stolen assets from Egypt and other Arab spring countries remains murky. For example, the EU and Canada have adopted comprehensive sanctions lists on the freezing of assets associated with former Tunisian president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, but little is known about what was done to implement these lists.</p> <p>The US, to our knowledge, has not yet frozen any assets associated with Mubarak, or at least has not publicly communicated this. Middle-Eastern countries, where the bulk of assets stolen from Arab pring countries is suspected, are faring far from better.</p> <p>What is to blame for this obviously wilful negligence? Accusations have been voiced that the UK is protecting its banking industry by applying its regulations loosely and turning a blind eye \u2013 a criticism that Switzerland has also known for many years. The same must be suspected of other countries that are likely to have hosted illegally acquired fortunes from Arab spring countries and are now dragging their feet when it comes to co-operating with the new governments in repatriating those funds.</p> <p>Another question in this context is why banks only ever find those monies, or realise that they may be of suspicious origin, after foreign leaders have fallen from grace. Certainly, complex corporate structures often make detecting these assets difficult and it is therefore unlikely that all the assets stolen by Mubarak, Ben Ali, etc, will ever be found. But those bank accounts with multi-digit balances that have been found with relative ease after these leaders were toppled should have triggered more than a few raised eyebrows much earlier.</p> <p>How much longer will we let banks get away with this sloppy behaviour? Remember that Mubarak, Ben Ali and the likes have been groomed as strategic allies by the leaders of all the above-mentioned countries for years, and they only became <em>personae non gratae</em> when it was clear that the people in the streets of north Africa were going to win the battle and that domestically, it would be politically unwise to continue siding with these allies.</p> <p>When we see this and we see how ultimately justice and the law continue to be governed by domestic and international politics. I suspect that banks will not be feeling more heat anytime soon, or only when it is politically opportune.</p> <p>Why should we care? Because corruption kills. Misappropriation of public funds steals money that is so badly needed to establish and maintain vital public services such as emergency health clinics or clean sanitary infrastructure. Corruption steals money where it is needed to build schools and provide the next generation with choices. And, finally, corruption destroys business competition which in turn hampers economic development.</p> <p>To overcome these developmental hurdles, our countries give more or less generously in the form of development assistance. But unless we achieve true and sincere policy coherence of key dossiers, namely coherence of foreign affairs, development aid and business and foreign trade policies, unless those same countries that provide aid stop acting as safe havens for political leaders and their stolen funds, the stories of Mubarak and Ben Ali will repeat themselves over and over and over again.</p>",
  "<p><strong>William Hill</strong> is moving higher after a buy note and speculation it could be close to a deal to take full control of its online business.</p> <p>Joint venture partner Playtech, which develops software platforms for gaming businesses, owns 29% of William Hill Online, and the two sides have had a fractious relationship over the years. William Hill has until November to exercise an option to buy back the Playtech stake, and in its last results statement in July, it said:</p> <blockquote> In the fourth quarter the group will have the opportunity to commence a process [to buy the Playtech stake] through the first of two contractual call options. <br> Our chairman and chief executive continue to meet regularly with their counterparts [at] Playtech ahead of this. Discussions have been amicable and continue. </blockquote> <p>Analyst Simon French at Panmure Gordon pointed to suggestions that William Hill was considering a retail bond offering, which could be used to fund a buyout of the 29% shareholding. He said this would heighten speculation a deal was near.</p> <p>William Hill would need to pay \u00a3369m on his calculations, but Playtech also has the option to take a 10% stake in William Hill itself as part of any deal.</p> <p>In a buy note with a 350p price target - based on an upgrade to his forecasts following better than expected half year figures - he said:</p> <blockquote> We estimate [buying the stake] would increase pretax profits by around 3% on a pro-forma basis in an all cash deal although Playtech has the option to take up to 10% of William Hill shares as part of the consideration. <br> Given Playtech's difficulty in spending the funds it raised in November 2011, that could yet prove to be an appealing option. </blockquote> <p>William Hill is 1.8p higher at 306.8p while Playtech is down 0.5p at 395.5p. There have also been suggestions in the market that Playtech could be interested in buying <strong>888</strong>, up 5.75p at 92.75p, which is roughly the same size as the amount Playtech could get from selling the William Hill online stake.</p>",

Although that doesn't make them any less fair game for criticism, obviously.</p> <p>We've seen a union flag sponge of terrifying complexity (although really, who wants to eat blue cake?), a roquefort and pear tarte tatin, which I'm counting on to see me through the winter, and fresh bagels (saffron and golden raisin, and blueberry and white chocolate!) which may have spoilt forever the supermarket version.</p> <p>So, who is still in contention? Law-student John and Medical-student James, as they're officially named, are the obvious front runners \u2013 John excelled in the bread episode with his fig, walnut and gruyere bagels, while James is the young maverick of the group, attempting Italian meringue while most others go for French; making miniature macaroons for a tart topping, just for the hell of it. He comes equipped with a secret weapon too: an eight-year-old sourdough starter, all the way from his home in Shetland.</p> <p>There's something for everyone here \u2013 John has a Bieber-esque fringe and is fond of low-cut T-shirts, exhibiting a touching faith in their ability to distract Mary from his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/flour_and_eggs/status/243065582080114688\" title=\"\">drunken disasters</a>, while James, with his thick glasses, patterned knitwear and Graduate haircut, is the knowing epitome of geek chic. <a href=\"http://www.nowmagazine.co.uk/blogs/tv-addict/538750/say-hello-to-the-hunk-in-the-tank-top-why-i-ve-got-a-huge-crush-on-great-british-bake-off-s-james-morton/1#\" title=\"\">\"Say hello to the hunk in the tank top!\"</a> screams Now magazine.).</p> <p>But the pair could have rivals. Nervous Cathryn, who always seems to be biting her nails and hoping for the best, is clearly <a href=\"http://josblueaga.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">this season's Joanne</a> \u2013 like the 2011 Bake Off winner, she had kids early, and now feels she has something to prove to her family. Or, at least, that's what the voiceover claims.</p> <p>Then there's semi-retired Brendan, who, according to his official bio, is currently 90 loaves into a two-year project to bake all the breads in the world. As this hobby suggests, Brendan can be quite intense \u2013 his reaction, on finally clawing the Star Baker title in the last episode, was a slightly menacing: \"Now we can get down to really serious baking.\" Gawds.</p> <p>Danny could be the outside chance \u2013 like the cheerfully scatty nursery nurse Manisha, she appears touchingly surprised, and delighted whenever anything goes right, but, if previous series are anything to go by, the quiet ones are always the ones to watch.</p> <p>There's plenty more soggy-bottomed innuendo to look forward to with next week's pies episode: will earnest Ryan take Paul's advice and \"up his game\"? Will there be more tears from lazy latticer Sarah-Jane? But first share your favourite bakes of the series so far \u2013 and your tips for the series winner.</p>",
  "<p>If only condoms weren't such a bore. Whether you want childless sex with a partner, or free-for-all romps in rooms covered in bin liners and baby oil, sexual liberation comes at a price. The most recent scandal focused on the contraceptive implant Implanon, which, it <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2198721/Contraceptive-implants-Women-fear-fertility-hundreds-Implanon-gone-missing-body.html\" title=\"\">was exposed this week</a>, can sometimes just disappear. Inside women's bodies. Never to be found again.</p> <p>This is no small matter. Older women were originally prescribed the implant because, post-removal, fertility returns more quickly than with the contraceptive pill. Now those whose implants have gone walkabout could now have lost their chance ever to have children. Implanon is undetectable by x-ray; by the time the implant's hormones run out (they last for three years) these women may no longer be fertile.</p> <p>But it is no picnic to have a contraceptive implant lost somewhere in the body at any age. Though the NHS has now upgraded to an x-rayable version of the implant, this provides no assurance that it won't still travel, requiring surgery for removal. The contraceptive implant is powerful stuff. In the clinical trials, <a href=\"http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/archives/fdaDrugInfo.cfm?archiveid=55814%23section-6.2\" title=\"\">almost 20%</a> of women experienced prolonged bleeding. More than 10% experienced headaches, vaginitis, weight increase, acne, breast pain or abdominal pain.</p> <p>Where the global market in contraception is concerned, cost-effectiveness comes first, women's health second. <a href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/CG030\" title=\"\">NHS guidelines</a> repeatedly note cost effectiveness as a reason for recommending hormonal implants, injections, and intrauterine systems to women. Meanwhile, the contraceptive pill comes with a whole host of similar assorted miseries. Though for many women these can be liberating choices that unshackle pleasurable sex from reproduction, for others, dramatic side-effects make life a trial.</p> <p>Trial is the operative term here. Women have many \"choices\", each as woeful as the last. Implants get lost, barriers might break, or give you cystitis; injections make you fat. Faced with this, women are playing hormone roulette, holding out for the one perfect method that often doesn't exist. At the same time, nobody is asking what it means for <a href=\"http://www.fpa.org.uk/professionals/factsheets/contraceptionpatternsofuse%23VmCn\" title=\"\">up to 44%</a> of British fertile women to be constantly on a cocktail of synthetic hormones.</p> <p>As arguments about capitalist markets in women's bodies go, this is clear cut. The development of male contraceptives has been lagging for years, hobbled by the profit-driven politics of the global pharmaceutical industry. An apparently 100% effective, side-effect free, non-hormonal male contraceptive named <a href=\"http://malecontraceptives.org/methods/risug.php\" title=\"\">RISUG</a> is currently stalled in advanced clinical trials in India. Developed by independent scientists at low cost, international interest in it is tellingly scarce. While stops and starts in developing RISUG might also represent a worthwhile care over its safety, no such qualms are extended to contraceptives for women.</p> <p>The lack of male contraceptives places the onus of contraception squarely on women's shoulders. With condoms sometimes an unsatisfactory solution in long-term relationships, women are made into gatekeepers of sex, responsible for all precautions, reprehensible where precautions fail. Men are imagined to be overgrown children, their interest in family and fertility denied. Hung up on these archaic attitudes, heterosexual sex becomes heterosexual stress. Despite 16% of British men under 70 opting for vasectomy, the likely permanence of the procedure makes it an impractical option for most men. Revealingly, <a href=\"http://www.parsemusfoundation.org/Parsemus/New_male_contraceptives.html\" title=\"\">studies</a> are still being conducted to determine if \"men [would] accept the mechanism of action, a semen-free orgasm?\" Women have no such privilege.</p> <p>In all this, the sometimes grim reality of contraception is skated over by medical industries that do their best to present birth control as a set of easy alternatives. When \u2013 in 2012 \u2013 women are subject to such abject ethical failures as unfindable implants, it may be time to re-evaluate both the options and the way they are talked about. Reproduction should not be just a women's issue, and hormonal contraception is no stroll in the park. <a href=\"http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/am_i_being_unreasonable/1165847-AIBU-to-want-to-get-my-implant-removed-already/AllOnOnePage\" title=\"\">As Mumsnet user \"DaisyFields\" wrote</a>: \"I was I was made to think that it was the best thing since sliced bread; no pills to take, no periods and no pregnancy worries \u2013 the reality was very different.\"</p>",
  "<p>The US has decided to blacklist as a terrorist group the Haqqani network, perhaps the most ruthless and feared branch of the Afghan insurgency, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/07/world/asia/white-house-backs-blacklisting-militant-organization.html?hp\" title=\"\">the New York Times has reported</a>.</p> <p>For many, the surprise was not the decision itself, but how long it has taken. The group is believed to have been behind most of the spectacular attacks in Kabul in recent years, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/13/kabul-explosions-afghan-capital-blasts?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">including a rocket assault on the US embassy</a>, as well as deadly suicide bombings of US troops.</p> <p>But there have been concerns that targeting the group will worsen already difficult relations with Pakistan, long suspected of supporting the group through its feared ISI intelligence agency. Some officials also thought it might dim hopes for peace talks, although the Haqqanis have always been considered the faction least open to reconciliation.</p> <p>The group was founded as part of the anti-Soviet jihad by Jalaluddin Haqqani, the network's patriarch, who has now delegated most day-to-day operations to the next generation. He was once funded by the CIA and lionised by some in the US, including the congressman Charlie Wilson, who reportedly described him as \"goodness personified\".</p> <p>Haqqani joined the Taliban government as minister for tribal affairs after they captured Kabul in 1996, fleeing after they were ousted in late 2001 and taking up arms again.</p> <p>His stronghold is in the eastern province of Khost, a lawless area where the Afghan government over which has little control, although the group's leaders are widely believed to live across the border in Pakistan.</p> <p>There they are out of reach of the US forces that regularly capture senior insurgent leaders inside Afghanistan, but are still targeted by drones that last month killed Jalaluddin's son and operational commander, Badruddin Haqqani.</p> <p>They are considered the most sophisticated, ruthless and well-organised of the groups that make up the Afghan insurgency, and claim nominal allegiance to the Afghan Taliban.</p> <p>In addition to the embassy attack they are believed to have co-ordinated or supported a string of other deadly attacks including assaults on Kabul's high-end Serena and Intercontinental hotels, a bombing of the Indian embassy, and several kidnappings.</p> <p>Since the 1980s, however, the group has expanded beyond insurgency to become a mafia-like operation, as focused on \"the pursuit of wealth and power\" as it is on \"the Islamist and nationalist ideals for which [they] claim to fight,\" according to a recent paper by Gretchen Peters, at the Combating Terrorism Centre in West Point.</p> <p>\"Over the past three decades they have penetrated key business sectors, including import-export, transport, real estate and construction in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Arab Gulf and beyond,\" Peters wrote in <a href=\"http://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/haqqani-network-financing\" title=\"\">the paper, Haqqani Network Financing</a>.</p> <p>\"The Haqqanis employ violence and intimidation to extort legal firms and prominent community members and engaged in kidnap-for-ransom schemes&#xa0;\u2026 they protect and engage in the trafficking of narcotics and the precursor chemicals used to process heroin.\"</p>",
  "<p>Each week we look at two shops competing in the same sector, and review what they are offering customers: from how helpful the staff are to the best bargains on offer.</p> <p>Our review will be based on a visit to stores on the same high street, or online, so it will be just a snapshot of how the retailer is performing.</p> <p>To get a better idea of which retailers are delivering and which are falling short, we would like you to tell us about your experiences of the same shops.</p> <p>Some weeks, both stores we visit may do a good job; other weeks there will be one that stands out as being much better or worse. Your reviews will help us discover if this is a trend.</p> <p>This week, we compare photography shops Snappy Snaps and Jessops.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.snappysnaps.co.uk/\" title=\"Snappy Snaps website\">Snappy Snaps</a></h2> <p><strong>Background</strong> Snappy Snaps was founded in 1983 by Don Kennedy and Tim MacAndrews and has about 120 franchised outlets in the UK. Originally, branches specialised in straightforward photo processing but now the focus is more on gift items.</p> <p><strong>The visit</strong> 10am, 30 August 2012, Reading.</p> <p><strong>What it sells</strong> Photo print outs on paper or on gift items.</p> <p><strong>First impressions</strong> From the outside the shop sign was prominent, with the familiar green and yellow branding, though the interior looks like it could do with a spruce up. This is a small store with processing equipment behind the counter, and in the centre of the shop are three kiosks for self-service digital printing.</p> <p><strong>What were the staff like?</strong> As I walked up to the kiosks a salesman talked me through the process. Despite an offer of help I just asked for a quick explanation, allowing me to go about my mission in the store. The machines were relatively simple to use: inserting your memory card; viewing and editing your pictures (including red eye and cropping) via the touch screen; choosing the ones you want processed and selecting the size and finish (matt or gloss) before taking a receipt to the till.</p> <p><strong>Best bargain</strong> \u00a318 for 100 6\"x4\" photos.</p> <p><strong>What does it charge?</strong> 30 6\"x4\" photos, \u00a39.60; 30 7\"x5\" photos, \u00a313.80 \u2013 both processed in about an hour. A CD with your pictures on it was \u00a34.99 and passport photos were \u00a37.99.</p> <p><strong>Where can I pay?</strong> There was a counter at the front of the store and I didn't have to wait to pay as there was only other customer.</p> <p><strong>Lasting impressions</strong> The shop had plenty to offer the individual who likes to use their photos in imaginative ways, including clocks, jigsaws and mugs. The service was fast and efficient with no attempt made to sell me products I didn't want. When I returned to collect my photos the salesperson was helpful when I couldn't find my proof of purchase slip which I had managed to lose, though the opening photo of me with a cheesy grin did provide perfect ID.</p> <p><strong>Overall rating</strong> 7.5/10.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.jessops.com/\" title=\"\">Jessops</a></h2> <p><strong>Background</strong> Frank Jessop opened his first store in Leicester in 1935. There are now more than 200 branches and an online shop. Frank's son Alan sold the firm in 1996 in a management buyout, and the company is now a subsidiary of Snap Equity Limited.</p> <p><strong>The visit</strong> 10.30am, 30 August 2012, Reading.</p> <p><strong>What it sells</strong> Photo prints, cameras and accessories.</p> <p><strong>First impressions</strong> This branch is on the same parade as Snappy Snaps, though in a less prominent position. It's a relatively small store with a good display of cameras in the centre, both in and on a glass cabinet, and down the right-hand side of the store. Most of the accessories were towards the back.</p> <p><strong>What were the staff like?</strong> Very helpful at first, explaining how to use the processing and printing machines. But when I needed help later on the shop had suddenly got busy with six people waiting to be served and only two assistants, one in the back room presumably processing pictures. After almost 10 minutes of trying to make eye contact the person who had previosuly helped me looked at me with a manic but polite expression, gesturing that he would be with me in a minute. When he did come he apologised for the wait and answered my queries.</p> <p><strong>Best bargain</strong> \u00a39.99 for some passport photos with 50 free 6\"x4\" prints.</p> <p><strong>What does it charge?</strong> 30 7\"x5\" photos within 25 minutes (or your money back), \u00a315; within 1 hour, \u00a310.80; within 24-hours, \u00a39.30. A CD of the photos was \u00a33. Jessops claims it will match its rivals' prices on cameras, accessories and digital photographs.</p> <p><strong>Where can I pay?</strong> A till in the centre of the store.</p> <p><strong>Is loyalty rewarded?</strong> I received a voucher as I paid for my photos for 20% off canvas prints, though I spotted a poster outside promoting 25% off.</p> <p><strong>Lasting impressions</strong> A good, modern store that was cheaper than Snappy Snaps. The reason for me asking for assistance in Jessops was a message on the editing machine warning that the photos I had chosen for processing were not suitable for 7\"x5\" prints as the resolution was not good enough. I chose to override this and the photos were indeed a little bit grainy, so they were right to warn me. However, with Snappy Snaps the exact same pictures seemed better quality.</p> <p><strong>Overall rating</strong> 7/10.</p> <h2>Last week</h2> <p>When <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/aug/31/store-wars-asda-morrisons\" title=\"Store Wars: Asda and Morrisons\">Asda took on Morrisons in the battle of the supermarkets</a> there was a clear winner: the latter netted 59% of your votes. Asda was a favourite with 16% of those who voted while 25% preferred another retailer.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18002023\" title=\"Store Wars comment\">Belshazzar</a> made us all want to move to Cheadle Heath with a description of the local Morrisons:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[It] is now, after refurbishment, the best supermarket around. You mentioned the veg with the misty sprays but not the sheer range of fresh produce they serve. Its the only place around you seem to be able to get samphire unpacked (and a hell of a lot cheaper) and fresh tumeric, as well as any type of onion, lettuce and the most obscure mushrooms and other veg \u2013 even 3 or 4 types of asparagus! The fish counter has an excellent range and unlike Waitrose the butchers counter actually butcher the meat in store so the range of cuts is much better \u2013 pigs cheeks and trotters being the best addition to the standards.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18002922\" title=\"Store Wars comment\">KetLegs</a> said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I find Morissons and pretty much every other supermarket to be far better than Asda. Asda's own brands are pretty poor and their bakery the worst of any supermarkets. Morissons's bakery I would say is one of the best \u2013 my local even does a wholemeal sour dough loaf which I have never seen before and is really tasty.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>One alternative with a few mentions was Booths. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18001362\" title=\"Store Wars comment\">gooismeid</a> was one who sang its praises:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"May not be as cheap on the basics and branded goods as Asda or Morrisons, but I find that I'm actually enthusiastic about cooking when I shop at Booths because of the range of lovely looking food and the knowledgeable staff, whereas I never feel interested in the food at Asda. Since Booths opened near me I've eaten better and I don't end up throwing much food away any more as I don't get seduced by BOGOFs or 3 for 2s.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Since we launched Store Wars a year ago we have visited 97 shops around the country, prompting 3,015 reader comments, and this is your last opportunity to add to that total.

  "<p><em>Adrian Fennell is a partner at </em><a href=\"http://www.rochesurveyors.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Roche Chartered Surveyors </em></a></p> <p><strong>The availability of parking is an important consideration:</strong> Parking is essential for local parades, particularly on arterial routes where ease and convenience for the shopper is essential, as it is in out-of-town retail parks. In market towns, ease of parking \u2013 and in particular free parking \u2013 is an important consideration for retailers, and also for the success and vibrancy of the town centre. City centres will have various key anchors \u2013 these could be car parks, transport hubs, department stores, major tourist attractions, markets and so on.</p> <p><strong>The layout of the location is important:</strong> Dwell time is essential for a shopping centre, hence they lay on food courts, entertainment and so on. The physical properties of the street are important. If the street is narrow then it will act as a funnel and people tend not to stop; trees, benches and mall kiosks can all deflect pedestrian flow as well. Pedestrianised streets tend to offer a more relaxed shopping environment, encouraging spend and dwell time.</p> <p><strong>Size matters:</strong> For small businesses, due to the cost of fitting out retail space, smaller shops often look better and more inviting. It is difficult to make a large shop look appealing on a tight budget. Many fashion retailers are spending \u00a3100 per sq ft on their fit out.</p> <p><strong>Generally speaking competition is a good thing for consumers and retailers:</strong> If you look at the high street, phone shops will often be in close proximity, as will shoe shops, jewellers and fashion retailers. Shoppers can identify with a location for a certain product, do their research in this location and then buy. Where it acts against a retailer is where two neighbours are selling the same branded product. This is why, for example, some luxury watch brands only have one retailer per town.</p> <p><em>Paul Bagust is associate director of the </em><a href=\"http://www.rics.org/site/\" title=\"\"><em>Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors</em></a></p> <p><strong>Do your research:</strong> Altering services such as electricity and gas can be extremely expensive, so always ensure that the property has adequate mains services and that they are in good order. Ensure that the premises comply with health and safety requirements, including fire regulations and access requirements under disability legislation.</p> <p><em>Rosie Cann is founder and director of </em><a href=\"http://www.popupspace.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Popupspace Ltd</em></a></p> <p><strong>Consider the benefits of a pop-up shop:</strong> We've seen a big change in landlord attitudes to short-term leasing over the past couple of years. This is driven by the glut of empty shops but also by the use of the pop-up concept by big retail brands. It's sometimes possible to secure bargain deals \u2013 in quieter locations we can sometimes negotiate rent-free terms, where the occupier pays business rates only. Pop-up is not a cheap option if you want a prime location, but the benefits of trading without the commitment (or repairing liabilities) of a long lease are obvious. For our clients, the advantages of pop-up leasing are as much about PR as they are about retail.</p> <p><strong>Talk to other retailers in the area:</strong> Your potential neighbours will have information you can't buy anywhere.</p> <p><em>Bill Grimsey is a customer services expert in the retail sector. He has worked for Tesco, Wickes, The Big Food group and Focus DIY</em></p> <p><strong>E-commerce will become increasingly important:</strong> I anticipate that within five years, 50% of non-food shopping will be online. As online shopping accelerates at an ever-increasing pace, small retailers need to be smarter than ever before. Getting your product to market online is a must for retailers, big or small.</p> <p><strong>Consider negotiating:</strong> Everyone should recognise that retail landlords are experiencing the worst conditions that they have ever encountered in the past 30 years. Like any supply-and-demand situation, the time is ripe for retailers to negotiate more realistic terms with landlords who don't want empty units. Look for partnership with landlords, as retailers and landlords are in this together.</p> <p><em>Richard Jenkings is a lead consultant at </em><a href=\"http://www.experian.co.uk/hp/index-a.html\" title=\"\"><em>Experian</em></a></p> <p><strong>Make sure you've got a good credit history:</strong> A potential tenant will make their life easier if they make sure their personal credit history is good. When a business is starting up, it is obviously harder to persuade a landlord that they are a good bet. If they do not have a past track record for the business, they will look at what information they can get about the individual.</p> <p>Our data has shown many times that retailers get higher sales in places with more competitors. But competition rises as shopping centres and high streets get bigger and better. For most small retailers, they are not the destination for the customer. The destination is the place itself. If you are located in a better place which has more competition and where rents and leases are higher, then you will take more money.</p> <p><em>Des Mulholland is a</em><a href=\"http://www.theretailconsultant.net/\" title=\"\"><em> retail management consultant</em></a></p> <p><strong>Think long and hard before relocating:</strong> If you want to relocate your business, ask yourself if it is really the location that has been your downfall rather than poor business management. Have you made the right decision in deciding on your current location? Are your current trading figures poor because of the location or mis-management of the business? Although location is important, all the other facets of a non-successful business need to be analysed before you consider relocation. Relocation is such an expensive undertaking for a successful business, never mind for one that is underperforming. There are instances where relocation is very much the incorrect decision; the costs associated with the move are usually prohibitive.</p> <p><em>Jaana Jatyri is CEO of the global trend forecaster </em><a href=\"http://www.trendstop.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Trendstop.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>How can you demonstrate your strengths to a landlord?</strong> Apart from being able to show strong commercial credentials in terms of financing of the operations, one option could be to show that the venture has broader appeal, or an interesting concept. Such as teaming up with another retailer to offer food and some kind of complementary product retail under the same roof. There could be opportunities for pooling finances that way too. Getting the support of other local businesses could help get the landlords to listen as well.</p> <p><em>Shrimp Balfour and Ben Sheinwald own the pop-up food stall </em><a href=\"http://www.rainbofood.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Rainbo</em></a></p> <p><strong>It's great being mobile:</strong> You can switch things up week to week and mix regular pitches with one-off events. But if you stick to solely regular markets you miss out on one-offs, and vice versa. At the moment it is pretty tough to find places to trade for new street food traders because there are not enough pitches in London to meet the needs of us all, and councils are not often willing to let us trade in the street.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>British editors often say they would like to have the freedom exercised by the media in the United States, which is underpinned by rights granted in the first amendment.</p> <p>When people are arrested in Britain newspapers are restrained from publishing material that might prejudice a possible trial. The suspect's reputation is also protected by the law of libel. </p> <p>Some editors dislike the constraints and have dared, on occasion, to ignore the law. When Joanna Yeates was murdered, for example, her landlord, Christopher Jefferies, was ill-treated. The result: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Joanna_Yeates\">two papers were fined for contempt of court and eight papers paid him libel damages.</a></p> <p>But why should anyone laud the American system? A current case in South Carolina, as detailed by media academic Doug Fisher, illustrates the gross injustice of letting the press do as it likes, <a href=\"http://commonsensej.blogspot.ie/2012/09/how-newspaper-is-convicting-man-before.html\">How a newspaper is a convicting a man before trial.</a> </p> <p>Let's start off with <a href=\"http://www.thestate.com/2012/08/29/2416650/monster-charged-with-kidnapping.html\">this headline on 29 August</a> in South Carolina's largest daily newspaper, The State...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395788086\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347003086874/swainson-monsterhed.jpg\" alt=\"mon\" width=\"320\" height=\"117\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It concerns Freddie Grant, a man arrested following the disappearance of a 15-year-old girl, Gabrielle Swainson. The story below it is based on an interview with the local sheriff, Leon Lott.</p> <p>As Fisher remarks, the sheriff \"no slouch when it comes to media savvy, continues to spin the story like a twister coming out of the plains.\"</p> <p>Here are the opening paragraphs to the story:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"A man described as a monster and a career criminal forced 15-year-old Gabrielle Swainson from her home in the wee hours of the night on Aug. 18 and took her to his burned-out house on a dirt lane in Elgin.</p> <p>What happened in that house is unknown, but there is clear evidence of foul play, Sheriff Leon Lott said Tuesday.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Fisher seems unduly upset about the opening par because it is unattributed, which strikes me as completely beside the point. Whether attributed or not, the fact is that readers will have an image of Grant as \"a monster\" and know he has a criminal record.</p> <p>I'm slightly more in accord with him over his analysis of a follow-up story, headlined <a href=\"http://www.thestate.com/2012/09/06/2427104/lott-kidnapping-suspect-had-key.html\">Lott: Kidnapping suspect had key to Columbia teen's home.</a> It began:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The mystery of how an accused kidnapper entered the home of missing teen Gabrielle Swainson has been solved after investigators found a key inside the suspect's house, Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott said Wednesday.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Fisher points to the Associated Press stylebook:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"To avoid any suggestion that an individual is being judged before a trial, do not use a phrase such as accused slayer John Jones; use John Jones, accused of the slaying.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But that's just a wrinkle. The real sin here, surely, is the revealing of key evidence before trial in a pejorative manner. The crime is all but \"solved\" in this story. </p> <p>In the latest development yesterday - though you may well feel the horse bolted long ago - <a href=\"http://www.thestate.com/2012/09/06/2428880/lawyers-for-teens-suspected-kidnapper.html\">Grant's lawyers have asked the court to silence the sheriff.</a> In seeking a gag order, their writ says: \"Mr Lott has not arrested a monster; he is trying to build one.\" Exactly.</p> <p>And the newspaper - standing four square behind its \"right\" to report fearlessly - is certainly aiding the sheriff in his character assassination. Freedom is all very well but it must be used responsibly.</p> <p>I really don't think we want that kind of press freedom in Britain, do we? </p> <p><em>Sources:</em> <a href=\"http://commonsensej.blogspot.ie/2012/09/how-newspaper-is-convicting-man-before.html\">Commonsense journalism</a>/<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Joanna_Yeates\">Wikipedia</a>/The State: <a href=\"http://www.thestate.com/2012/08/29/2416650/monster-charged-with-kidnapping.html\">(1)</a> <a href=\"http://www.thestate.com/2012/09/06/2427104/lott-kidnapping-suspect-had-key.html\">(2)</a> <a href=\"http://www.thestate.com/2012/09/06/2428880/lawyers-for-teens-suspected-kidnapper.html\">(3)</a></p>",

She lives in an impoverished near-slum on the outskirts of Islamabad where a minority community of Christians live.</p> <p>Lawyers representing the man who originally claimed to have caught Rimsha carrying what he thought were burned verses from Islam's most holy book tried to block the bail.</p> <p>Rimsha's legal team responded by saying they were using \"hyper technical arguments\" to try to challenge the paperwork of the bail hearing.</p> <p>The prosecution also attempted to undermine a medical board's assessment that Rimsha was legally a minor and that she was \"mentally slow\". Rimsha's supporters have long claimed she has Down's syndrome.</p> <p>A decision on whether she will have to stand trial will be made after officials have finished their investigation into an affair that has cast unprecedented light on Pakistan's notorious blasphemy laws, which have been widely abused over the years and can carry the death penalty or long jail terms.</p> <p>Ali Dayan Hasan, the Pakistan director of Human Rights Watch, said the organisation welcomed the court decision and urged the government to guarantee her security.</p> <p>\"The fact is that this child should not have been behind bars at all,\" he said. \"All charges against her should be dropped and Pakistan's criminal justice system should instead concentrate on holding her accuser accountable for inciting violence against the child and members of the local Christian community.\"</p> <p>He said the organisation hoped the case would \"lead to a considered re-examination of the law\".</p> <p>However, most analysts say reform, let alone repeal, of the decades-old law is highly unlikely as the country gears up for national elections.</p>",

All of which will minimise your interaction with actual real-life waiting staff.</p> <p>This is just the start. Among hospitality-focused <a href=\"http://www.zonal.co.uk/\">tech companies</a> there <a href=\"http://www.fourthhospitality.com/fourth/pdf/on-screen-heroes.pdf\">is much excitement (pdf)</a> about such <a href=\"http://www2.qsrmagazine.com/articles/features/117/ordering-1.phtml\">DIY \"solutions\"</a>. A future where you are issued with an iPad on arrival, or are asked to use your phone or a <a href=\"http://www.qsrweb.com/article/181494/McDonald-s-Europe-expects-kiosks-to-increase-jobs\">kiosk</a> to order and pay is not far away; the waiters will simply deliver the food to your table. The software is here already. For instance, <a href=\"http://www.micros-fidelio.co.uk/en-GB/Company/Press/Press-Releases/en-GB/2010/3/10.aspx\">Wagamama's mobile app</a> enables you to order and pay for <a href=\"http://www.wagamama.com/latest/news/from/wagamama/114\">takeaway food</a> for collection later. Such self-ordering and self-payment technology can easily be tweaked to work in a restaurant context.</p> <p>Why is this happening? Because the restaurant industry loves anything that helps it turn tables quicker, reduce staff costs and minimise training. Who needs product knowledge or training in the dark arts of <a href=\"http://theblackboard.net/blogs/should-you-use-upselling-as-a-restaurant-marketing-tactic/\">upselling</a> when an <a href=\"http://www.emenu-international.com/solutions/table-side-emenu\">electronic menu screen</a> at the table can display endless information about each dish and step-by-step customer sales prompts?</p> <p>Indeed, there is anecdotal evidence that, if diners are left alone, they actually spend more. For many people, there is something almost adversarial about eating out - a sense that restaurants are out to rip us off, that you must remain constantly alert. Put people in control of the ordering process and, conversely, they let their guard down. Suddenly, it's their decision to have that extra drink or dessert. They don't feel that they are being hustled into it.</p> <p>So far, the change has been most profound in <a href=\"http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/a20110625.html\">wine</a>. Sommeliers must nervously finger their silver lapel grapes (no, that isn't a euphemism) every time another restaurant puts its wine list <a href=\"http://www.decanter.com/news/wine-news/529704/fine-dining-goes-hi-tech-as-restaurants-embrace-ipad-wine-lists\">on an iPad</a>. At Manchester's <a href=\"http://www.australasia.uk.com/\">Australasia</a>, you browse an online wine catalogue which is hosted, updated and managed - such is the modern world - by a firm in <a href=\"http://www.incentient.com/\">New York</a>. That web access is restricted, of course. Restaurants don't want you surfing porn or streaming movies at your table, much less going online to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/feb/28/restaurant-wine-markups-fair\">compare their wine prices</a> with a retail vintner's. Maze, Bread Street Kitchen and the Vineyard at Stockcross are just some of the venues which have <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2010/09/wine_and_technology\">followed suit</a>. </p> <p>Personally, I'm torn. I won't use self-service supermarket tills because they put people out of work and, for many customers, nattering to the checkout staff is precious social interaction. I should hate such automation. In the realm of wine specifically, though, the iPad has a kind of irresistible cultural momentum. An electronic wine list is perfect for a country which, on the whole, has <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/168127/Britons-lack-basic-wine-knowledge-Britons-lack-basic-wine-knowledge-Britons-lack-basic-wine-knowledge-Britons-lack-basic-wine-knowledge\">limited wine knowledge</a> and where people are useless at asserting themselves in restaurants. </p> <p>In theory, putting yourself in a sommelier's hands, outlining what you want and paying a reasonable premium for that expertise should add to the pleasure of your meal. In reality, many sommeliers lack the people skills to negotiate this exchange and too many restaurants are still happy to land guests with unexpectedly expensive wines. <a href=\"http://www.wine-pages.com/features/wavface.htm\">Few Britons</a> - me included - feel able to confidently state: \"I like grape X and country Y and I'll pay \u00a3Z.\" Dealing with a sommelier is fraught with anxiety. Who wouldn't prefer to browse tasting notes, food-matching suggestions and a price list on an iPad?</p> <p>More broadly, however, this dehumanising of the restaurant experience is, surely, a bad thing. Not disastrous, no: the food, and what it costs, will always be more important. But in the fast-casual sector where these robot restaurants will flourish (pad, pen and personalised service will endure at fine dining level), will the customer really benefit? I don't want to \"work\" when I'm eating out, pressing buttons and clicking through screens. Nor do I want to spend ages poring over the background info contained in an <a href=\"http://www.x2computing.com/products-services/electronic-dining-solutions.aspx\">electronic menu</a> (too much of a good thing), when I could be talking to the people I'm with.</p> <p>Finally, self-ordering also removes even the possibility of great service. In Britain, where it has never been treated as a serious profession, you may think that boat has sailed. But on those rare occasions that you come across a good waiter - a natural who can correctly calibrate chat, wise recommendations, speed and efficiency - it can transform your night. In the restaurant of 2015, where we sit down and log in to buy our dinner as we might a DVD or train ticket online, will something have been lost?</p>",
  "<p>Standing in line under the blazing sun with dozens of other young women at a makeshift prenatal clinic in a Manila slum, 14-year-old Jasmin Balute says she is too young to have a child. \"It's too late now,\" she reflects, \"but I realise girls my age should be in school, playing around \u2013 not taking care of a baby. I have never used birth control; I don't know about it.\"</p> <p>Marycris Fajardo says she had sex \"without knowing what could happen\". Fajardo, 16, comes from a large family without enough money for everyone to finish primary school; she equates pregnancy with giving up her hopes of escaping poverty. \"I wish I hadn't got pregnant so I could go back to school,\" she says. \"I would have liked to wait a while before having a child. If I had known about contraceptives, I would have used them.\"</p> <p>Such sentiments are common in the Philippines, a country of 96 million people and with the second highest teenage pregnancy rate in south-east Asia. Government statistics show that, in the past five years, the number of babies born to teenage mothers has risen from 39 to 54 for every 1,000 births.</p> <p>A controversial <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_Health_Bill#Bill_content\" title=\"\">reproductive health bill</a>, now before the Philippine Congress, takes aim at these figures. Under the bill, free contraceptives and information on family planning will be available through government health centres, and comprehensive reproductive health classes will be held in schools.</p> <p>The majority of the population either doesn't have access to or can't afford artificial birth control. This landmark legislation would offer Filipino women a choice they have not previously had.</p> <p>However, the bill has faced fierce opposition. More than 80% of Filipinos are devout Catholics and the Roman Catholic church, which has significant political influence, has accused the bill's supporters of condoning abortion, which is illegal.</p> <p>Father Melvin Castro, executive secretary of the Catholic bishops' conference of the Philippines episcopal commission on family and life, says educating young people about reproductive health and \"distributing contraceptives to anyone who wants them\" will hurt rather than help society.</p> <p>But proponents of the bill say it is about giving women the basic right to choose how many children they want to have, and when they want to have them.</p> <p>Ugochi Florence Daniels, Philippine representative to the <a href=\"http://www.unfpa.org/public/\" title=\"\">UN Population Fund</a>, says young people are being failed by the lack of services and information. \"There's no sexuality education in school, and there's no policy. So for a poor young person in the Philippines, what are your options? None. They get pregnant.\"</p> <p>When this happens, a young woman's priority is then providing for her child, not finishing school, says Elizabeth Angsioco, national chairperson of the <a href=\"http://dswp.org.ph/\" title=\"\">Democratic Socialist Women of the Philippines</a>. \"The direction of her life immediately changes and opportunities for her to escape poverty become limited because she lacks education. She may eventually learn about birth control but be too poor to use it, and have more children.\"</p> <p>The bill's authors say it's concerned with preventing not just unwanted pregnancies but maternal deaths. At the June launch of the national statistics office's 2011 family health survey, the Philippine health secretary, Enrique Ona, said <a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.ph/content/speech-health-secretary-enrique-t-ona-md-message-be-delivered-during-launch-national\" title=\"\">the number of women dying from complications arising from childbirth increased</a> from 162 to 221 for every 100,000 live births between 2006 and 2010. \"This translates to 11 women dying a day [rising] to 14 or 15,\" says Daniels.</p> <p>Amina Evangelista Swanepoel, executive director of <a href=\"http://rootsofhealth.org/\" title=\"\">Roots of Health</a>, a maternal health organisation working with impoverished communities, says many poor women are dying because of a lack of emergency and special care. Young women have multiple births in rapid succession. \"If you are 23 and on your seventh pregnancy, it [creates a] risk of complications during pregnancy or birth.\"</p> <p>According to Dr Alberto Romualdez, former health secretary and now vice-president of the Forum for Family Planning and Development, the inequity in the reproductive health system is one of the biggest problems facing the country.</p> <p>\"Rich women will say they want two children and they have two,\" says Romualdez. \"In a poor area, you will see the average desired fertility is three children, yet women are having six \u2026 because they don't have access to family planning supplies and information.\"</p> <p>Although it has been a 14-year battle to get the bill on to the legislative floor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/08/philippines-birth-control-legislation-church\" title=\"\">national surveys</a> show 65% to 70% of Filipinos support it. The country's president, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benigno_Aquino_III\" title=\"\">Benigno Aquino</a>, is also behind it, and urged lawmakers to take it forward in his annual state address in July.</p> <p>But it will not be an easy ride. Church officials have been visiting politicians to convince them to strengthen their positions, and priests have spoken out against the bill from the pulpit. At a recent senate meeting, one politician railing against the bill declared that his son had died soon after birth because his wife had taken contraceptive pills.</p> <p>However, there are signs that lawmakers might be willing to negotiate a compromise on the bill's most salient points. The bill's co-author, <a href=\"http://www.edcellagman.com.ph/\" title=\"\">Edcel Lagman</a>, recently said that amendments to emphasise that reproductive health services would be geared to the \"poorest and most marginalised households\" were being discussed.</p> <p>Debates on the bill are expected to resume within the next few weeks. Supporters will want to see it passed before campaigning for the next congressional elections starts in October. Meanwhile, teenage girls such as Jasmin Balute will continue to have children before they are ready.</p>",
  "<p><em>Today's extract from the updated edition of <strong>The phone-hacking scandal: journalism on trial,*</strong> is devoted to a chapter written by <strong>Ray Snoddy</strong>, one of the most experienced of media commentators. </em></p> <p><em>He condemns the practice of phone hacking by the News of the World but asks: why did we have a judicial inquiry under Lord Justice Leveson? Then he provides an answer...</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395785880\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1346997028618/HackBookFront.jpg\" alt=\"hac\" width=\"165\" height=\"250\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The setting up of the Leveson inquiry was an outrageous piece of political expediency by prime minister David Cameron \u2013 a manoeuvre straight out of the PR crisis management handbook. When everything appears to be hitting the fan, do something dramatic such as setting up as wide-ranging an inquiry as possible, which happily will not report for ages. </p> <p>You might think, however, that accusing a politician of political expediency is a bit like observing that the tide comes in twice a day. Cameron compounded his sins by also apparently prejudging the outcome of the inquiry by describing the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) as a \"failed\" organisation.</p> <p>Save in one respect \u2013 dealing with illegal phone hacking \u2013 the PCC is not a failed organisation. It is one that has worked tirelessly to get fast free redress for those who have been subject to inaccurate or intrusive reporting without reasonable cause and a strong case can be made that, on the whole, press behaviour has improved over the past 20 years. </p> <p>There have been disgraceful exceptions, such as the contempt of court and libels committed in the Jo Yeates murder case as with Madeleine McCann.</p> <p>It is true that the PCC was not set up to investigate criminal behaviour, and citizens always have the right to go to the courts to seek redress. </p> <p>It is also true that it might have been less unquestioning in believing the \"one rogue reporter\" story put about by News International. But then again the PCC was certainly misled by News International and the police. </p> <p>The danger is not that Lord Justice Leveson is a lackey who will produce a preordained outcome. Quite the reverse. The problem is that the inquiry was so widely framed that there is no way of predicting what the result will be \u2013 how far it will reach. In a year or two's time we could be contemplating once again the law of unintended consequences \u2013 considerable harm, innocently done.</p> <p>The problems that all such commissions and inquiries have faced over the<br>past 70 years are very easy to identify. There is no agreed definition of what the public interest actually is \u2013 nor do I suspect can there be. </p> <p>Was it in the public interest for the Daily Telegraph to publish details of MPs' expenses even though the information material was undoubtedly stolen and sold for money? Most people would probably say yes. </p> <p>But the same newspaper sent young female reporters to Vince Cable's constituency office and discovered the not uninteresting information that Cable was completely biased against Rupert Murdoch.</p> <p>Were the journalists justified on public interest grounds? The PCC ruled no because it was a fishing expedition. The two examples illustrate very well how finely balanced some of these judgements actually are.</p> <p>And then we have to come to terms with privacy and the almost terminal gulf between the two conflicting articles of human rights legislation \u2013 promising at the same time the right to privacy and a family life and the public's right to know. </p> <p>Call me biased if you like but it is my firm belief that the right to know should, on the whole \u2013 and weasel words yet again suggest the difficulty \u2013 take precedence over the right to privacy. </p> <p>Yes, you might say, but where does sleazy tabloid kiss-and-tell stories fit into this high-minded scenario? I am increasingly convinced they do, and in a quite important way. I have two grounds for arguing this: one practical and the other \u2013 for want of a better word \u2013 moral. </p> <p>In the internet age protecting most forms of privacy is simply impossible and courts will find enforcement increasingly difficult. This former Financial Times journalist is therefore going to take a difficult course by suggesting that those who earn vast sums of money in the public domain, trade off a pure image and can be seen as role models for the young, should be exposed \u2013 by currently legal means \u2013 when there is a vast gulf between that image and their actual behaviour.</p> <p>When such people go to court citing privacy what they are actually trying to do is prevent behaviour which they clearly are not in the slightest proud of becoming public knowledge, often with clear economic implications for them. </p> <p>In the internet age such information will become available somewhere. In the end such fine decisions on where the balance between what should be reported and what not is best decided by a body of independent people with an agreed code of practice that looks very much like the PCC, though a number of obvious improvements can be made.</p> <p>There is a further issue that Lord Justice Leveson must manage to get his mind around - the economics of the national newspaper industry.</p> <p>The \"digital pennies\" generated by newspapers do not even begin to pay for original hard news. Meanwhile, paper sales continue their apparently inevitable decline, putting pressure on finances at the more traditional end of the business.</p> <p>The logic should be clear: Leveson should avoid doing anything that will further damage the economics of newspaper publishing \u2013 damage that would inevitably follow a new round of sanitisation which some believe has already begun. </p> <p>It is increasingly clear that Lord Justice Leveson's main task has already been achieved. The misdeeds of the press, politicians and the police have been remorselessly exposed. </p> <p>We can now assume that phone hacking, seriously bribing of the police and a far too cosy relationship between newspaper proprietors and politicians are things of the past.</p> <p>When you clear away all the undergrowth there remains only one relatively modest thing for Lord Justice Leveson to do. He has to recommend the creation of a new regulatory body for the press. Not a tiny task but surely one that is far from insurmountable. </p> <p><em>On Monday:</em> <strong>Ivor Gaber</strong> dissects what he calls \"a campaign of vilification\" against a university professor by the Daily Mail and its Sunday sister</p> <p>*<em>The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial</em>, second and updated edition, edited by Richard Lance Keeble and John Mair, will be published by Abramis on 17 September.

  "<p><strong>What did you think when you heard that Kate Winslet wanted to record Mr Gum?</strong></p> <p>I was genuinely astounded, I couldn't believe it was really going to happen. I kept expecting her to come to her senses and call the whole thing off. But no - a few months later, there I was in a London recording studio, watching Kate Winslet recording my books in this unbelievably brilliant, crystal clear, Kate Winslet-y voice. Very surreal. I only hope it doesn't ruin her career, I'd feel bad about that.</p> <p><strong>Why do you think she wanted to do it?</strong></p> <p>She probably needed the money. Either that or she lost a bet.</p> <p><strong>If Kate were a Mr Gum character, who would she be?</strong></p> <p>I think that Kate has a lot in common with my heroine, Polly. They both have an unshakeable optimism and sense of fair play, and they're both incredibly determined characters who get things done whatever it takes. (Incidentally, Polly was James Cameron's first choice for Titanic but he changed his mind when he found out she was only nine years old and didn't really exist in certain crucial ways.)</p> <p><strong>Describe Kate in five words?</strong></p> <p>Exists in certain crucial ways.</p> <p><strong>What was the last book that you read?</strong></p> <p>A Clash of Kings by George RR Martin. It's the second in the epic Game of Thrones series. I'm not a big fantasy fan, I'm just reading it to see what all the fuss is about and slowly getting drawn in\u2026</p> <p><strong>Which fictional character would you most like to be?</strong></p> <p>Police Chief Martin Brody. I read Jaws by Peter Benchley when I was eight (it was the first 'grown-up' book I ever read) and I thought it was the coolest thing ever. I really liked the sense of this self-contained island community, and how Chief Brody was in this uniquely difficult position and how he was the one who had to step up to the plate and do something about it. I didn't consciously think of it in those terms, of course - I was only eight. But it seemed a very cosy and clear-cut world. And I mean, he faces off with a 25-foot great white shark. He's the coolest.</p> <p><strong>Which fictional character could you fall in love with?</strong></p> <p>Ellen Brody. If I'm going to be her fictional husband, it seems only polite to fall in love with her. Plus she's pretty hot in the film.<br><strong><br>Which book do you think everybody should read?</strong></p> <p>That's a really hard question, because some of my favourite books are not for everybody. So, after much thought: Of Mice and Men or The Great Gatsby. Just because they're such perfect, elegant, measured, universally truthful pieces. Everyone can get something out of them.</p> <p><strong>Where do you most like to read?</strong></p> <p>Bed's the best place to read. The runner up is while dining alone in cheap restaurants, preferably when it's raining outside. (If it's raining inside, it must be a really cheap restaurant.)</p> <p><strong>Where do you most like to write?</strong></p> <p>At home at my desk. Occasionally, when I'm really stuck, I'll try going to a caf\u00e9, but you just spend most of the time rearranging the coffee mug and getting cake crumbs all over your t-shirt and then there'll be some noisy conversation at the next table or the music's annoying or the chair's too uncomfortable. Writing at home's best because you have control over the environment. </p> <p><strong>If you were a superhero what would your superpower be?</strong></p> <p>All the good ones are already taken, aren't they? I bet I'd end up with a rubbish one, like the power to teleport figs over short distances. Or the power to almost guess people's birthdays correctly.</p> <p><strong>What one piece of advice would you give to aspiring writers?</strong></p> <p>Get to the end of the first draft. That's the hardest part. Don't polish it and edit it and worry it as you go along, or you'll never get there. Just get there and get there ugly and get there whatever it takes.</p> <p><strong>What is the weirdest thing a fan has ever said and/or given to you? </strong></p> <p>I've been given a cake made with eggs laid by chickens named after my characters, that was pretty strange but I'm not complaining, it was delicious. Another family named their cats Mr Gum and Billy William the Third, and proudly presented me with a photocopy of their last vet's bill to prove it. Kids ask amazingly strange questions at book events, so I've got plenty to choose from. Here are some of my favourites: \"What was the first mug you remember?\"; \"Can you mend my keyring, it's broken?\" and, from Edinburgh last year, the truly memorable \"Why is your nose so big?\"</p> <p><strong>Can you tell us a joke please?</strong></p> <p>Why did the monkey fall out of the tree? Because it was dead. That's an old Rik Mayall joke, I like it because it's so deliberately wrong in every way.</p>",

  "<p>Heritage minister John Penrose met with planning and heritage groups last month to discuss his department's proposed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2012/sep/03/apply-attend-local-government-quarterly-september\" title=\"\">shake-up of conservation</a>. His plans, which include outsourcing the work of conservation officers to the private sector, have drawn fierce criticism since they were published in July. After a lightning-fast consultation, discussions have now commenced in an attempt to reach some kind of compromise with critics, who believe the proposal is tantamount to privatising the role of the local authority conservation officer.</p> <p>Government ministers believe developers of listed buildings should appoint accredited agents to produce conservation reports for each restoration or development they carry out. These agents \u2013 who would most likely be architects, but could also be planning consultants or surveyors \u2013 would submit reports to local authorities, certifying applications as acceptable. Councils \"would normally be expected to follow this recommendation\".</p> <p>Planning and heritage experts are concerned about the lack of impartiality this model provides, with the developer appointing the agent to write the conservation report for its own application. Andrew Matheson, network manager of the <a href=\"http://www.rtpi.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal Town Planning Institute's</a> historic environment group, says: \"We're unenthusiastic about the idea that the democratic process might be circumvented. The notion that a report might not require the input of the local authority planning or conservation officer is not something we would support.\"</p> <p>The plan is intended to help tackle the lack of conservation officers in local government; the number of staff in the role has fallen by 21.8% since 2008. But Vincent Haines, a spokesman for the <a href=\"http://www.planningofficers.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Planning Officers Society</a>, says the need for experts in local government who can check the independence of conservation reports would negate any potential benefit. \"This proposal doesn't have the potential to tackle the problem [of reduced numbers of conservation officers],\" he says. \"The local planning authority will still have to assess and consult on the application.\"</p> <p><strong>Diminishing numbers</strong></p> <p>Some fear that the plan could even exacerbate the lack of conservation officers in local government. Faced with a diminished role in the listed-building consent process, there are fears that planning departments will choose to divert funds away from conservation completely. Kate Pugh, chief executive at the <a href=\"http://www.theheritagealliance.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Heritage Alliance</a>, says she believes the proposals could be seen as a green light to shed conservation officers. \"We do understand local authorities are under huge pressures,\" she says. \"Certainly we want to look at ways of streamlining the listed building procedures so that conservation officers can get on with other aspects of their work, but not as an excuse to get rid of them.\"</p> <p>Jane Kennedy, architect and partner at historic building consultancy <a href=\"http://www.purcelluk.com/\" title=\"\">Purcell</a>, says there may be cases when the private sector can support local government in relation to conservation. But she stresses that work must be commissioned by the public sector if it is to be objective. \"The way planning has moved over the last few years, more and more work is done by the applicant,\" she says. \"But you still need the public authority to assess applications. If an agent is paid by the building owner, they can't ever really be independent. As a practice we have taken on work on behalf of a local authority which didn't have a conservation officer. But we were paid by the local authority to review applications on their behalf. That is quite different.\"</p> <p><strong>Consultation queries</strong></p> <p>Given the level of concern about the proposals, the government consultation process was deemed to be lacking. A short window of just four weeks was given for responses, a period which coincided with both the 2012 Olympic Games and parliamentary recess. At least 10 national organisations wrote to criticise the government's approach to the consultation.</p> <p>Last week's meeting suggests the government is now seeking more detailed feedback on its proposals. The <a href=\"http://www.architecture.com/\" title=\"\">Royal Institute of British Architects</a>, which was among those who objected to the outsourcing plan, said discussions were \"productive and positive\". But for many, the only positive result from discussions will be if the idea of outsourcing is dropped.</p> <p>Hugh Ellis, chief planner at the Town and Country Planning Association, says: \"We're losing massive amounts of expertise from planning. This new regime has the potential to hollow out the planning system. That's what happens when you financially impoverish it and undermine the status and expertise of those within it.</p> <p>\"It's not that I don't think consultants could do the job. But what is the government trying to achieve with this move? If this is about cost saving, heritage assets will be put at risk.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis, best practice and </strong><a href=\"http://localgovernmentjobs.theguardian.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>the latest jobs</strong></a><strong> direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>So long, then, Grant Shapps. For all the criticism faced, you held on for a long time, showing grit and determination in forcing a culturally conservative sector to change where other housing ministers simply gave up and moved on. Promotion was inevitable, but what now for the new incumbent?</p> <p>Mark Prisk, as so many have already pointed out, could not take up his new ministerial brief at a more critical time. It must be a daunting task, with major announcements (and re-announcements) flying out of the Department for Communities and Local Government as the cabinet searches frantically for new ways to stimulate economic growth.</p> <p>The first big job in Prisk's brief is to promote a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/06/cameron-clegg-unveil-planning-reforms\" title=\"\">controversial planning holiday</a> which will allow developers to avoid their commitment to build affordable housing where they are developing new homes for private rent. Some of the debate around this latest effort at boosting construction misses its value: we urgently need more homes for rent, whatever the tenure.</p> <p>Critics fear that relaxing the requirement to develop social housing will let the construction industry poke a toe in the door only to kick it down entirely later on. This is unlikely, and ignores the need for a concerted effort to design a private rented sector (PRS) that meets social as well as economic needs. By inviting developers into this space through planning policy, ministers actually retain greater control over the evolution of the PRS.</p> <p>It's welcome to see action rather than throwaway rhetoric on better opportunities for what has become <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jun/19/housing-associations-landlord-choice-generation-rent\" title=\"\">known as \"generation rent\"</a>.</p> <p>We're arguably still three years away from a general election, but as David Cameron has used his cabinet reshuffle to mark his party out against coalition colleagues, the gloves are off.

With a new face, the coalition government has another chance to make its mark on the issue of private rent. Housing professionals want to see policy based on evidence \u2013 the essential data they gather in the business of their daily work \u2013 not on an outdated ideology that places home ownership at the top of a tenure hierarchy, despite inching further out of reach of the many.</p> <p>If this week's announcement marks a new attitude to growing and managing private rent then it should be supported by the social housing sector which, ultimately, has to admit it can no longer do everything.

  "<p>I am a social worker by profession and have been for 17 years. I had to give myself the rather grand title of \"consultant\" because of the range of work that I do.</p> <p>On a typical day I am woken by the telephone at 6.30am. It is the BBC asking if I can do an interview on a breaking story. (I have worked in media since I became independent four years ago).</p> <p>The interview goes well; I manage to get across what I want to say. I am one of those rare social workers who actually enjoys being cross-examined in court. People always ask how I can do the media work \u2013 isn't it frightening? But even Newsnight pales compares to being cross-examined.</p> <p>On from the studio to deliver a three-hour workshop to frontline social workers on the impact of neglect. Part of my job is as a child-protection trainer and I work closely with my local safeguarding children board, developing and delivering training.</p> <p>The workshop brings up stimulating discussions and I hope that delegates leave understanding that research and evidence is clear that the impact of neglect is just as damagingas other forms of maltreatment.</p> <p>From there I return to my office. A quick check of my emails tells me I have a query through <a href=\"http://www.joannanicolas.co.uk/\" title=\"\">my website</a> asking whether I can speak at a conference in London.</p> <p>Another query from a mother, asking me for help, who says she has seen me on the telly and has had her children taken away by social services. I also have a query about a vulnerable adult who is pregnant, from an organisation I act as safeguarding advisor for.</p> <p>I respond to all of those and then force myself to turn my emails off. I have a deadline on a book I am writing and I have to write 1,000 words today.</p> <p>The book is called \"Communicating with children\" and will be published in 2013. It is part of a series of pocket books for social workers and others working in child protection and follows on from my first book \"Conducting the home visit in child protection\".</p> <p>One of the challenges of working for yourself is having the discipline to sit down and do the work, particularly when you work from home and there are so many temptations \u2013 in my case, cooking, cleaning, washing and walking the dog.</p> <p>I manage 850 words before the telephone rings and the call has to take priority. I have just become one of the first accredited lead reviewers for the new model of serious case reviews and I am involved in one at the moment. I need to contact the family about meeting with them to hear their views. The book is set aside for now.</p> <p>At 10pm I am back in my office. Children sorted, home not too chaotic. I draw the curtains, my lovely husband brings me tea and the lure of the book is too strong.</p> <p>The telephone won't ring now, I will have peace but I tell myself I must go to bed by 11.30pm. I don't quite keep to that but only because I love what I do and consider myself so lucky that I have such variety in my work. I go to bed wondering what tomorrow will bring.</p> <p><em>If you know a role or someone who you would like to see featured in our A day in the life of ... series then get in touch by </em><a href=\"mailto:jessica.fuhl@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><em>emailing us</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/social-care/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian social care network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",

Eric Maillaud, the public prosecutor, said: \"At the moment we cannot say what happened, except four people were killed, or why. It's not that we have no idea; we have many ideas, many hypotheses, all of which are being looked at, but there are no real leads at the moment. My worry is that we may never find the killer.\"</p> <p>The body of French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, a local man and father of three children, who was on paternity leave, was found nearby.</p> <p>The car engine was still running when a former Royal Air Force officer came across the vehicle whose windows had been shattered by bullets shortly before 4pm on Wednesday. He first spotted the body of the elder girl, who had been violently beaten to the head and left for dead near the car and, seeing she was still breathing, called the emergency services.</p> <p>He then broke the driver's window of the car to cut the ignition and saw the three bodies in the car. Nearby, the man recognised the body of a cyclist who had overtaken him on the hill leading to the beauty spot only minutes before.</p> <p>Maillaud said the man, who he would not name, was \"as you can imagine, profoundly shocked\".</p> <p>It was not until almost eight hours later that police found the second little girl cowering in the footwell in the back of the car under the legs of the dead women, where she had not moved or made a sound.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395786881\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347000121382/Annecy-shootings-French-m-008.jpg\" alt=\"Annecy shootings: French murder of British family\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">French police remove the BMW from the scene of the murders.

She was invisible and completely silent,\" said Maillaud. \"She was clearly happy to be taken into the arms of the gendarme who brought her out. She smiled and started to speak in English. Almost straight away she asked where her family was.\"</p> <p>Lt Col Bertrand Fran\u00e7ois added: \"We did not search for survivors because there was never any indication there was a living person in that car. The girl was small and hiding under the legs of one of the women. She was too small to show up on a heat detector.\"</p> <p>The elder girl, who as well as being \"violently beaten\" was also shot in the shoulder, was said to be in a stable condition and out of danger in hospital where doctors said they had put her into an artificial coma to aid her recovery.</p> <p>The bodies of the victims will undergo detailed forensic examinations on Friday. Investigators say they will try to gently question the traumatised girl, but are unsure whether she will be able to help their inquiry. \"She's only four years old. Can you imagine? This child stayed still and silent next to a dead body for eight hours,\" Maillaud said. \"She will need to be helped and protected,\" he added.</p> <p>The French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said authorities will do their \"utmost to find the perpetrators\".</p> <p>In Britain, Surrey police said they were assisting the French inquiry. If robbery is ruled out as a motive, then inquiries may focus on Hilli's background to see if there was any clue in his life and work as to why he may have been targeted.</p> <p>Hilli came to Britain over 20 years ago from Iraq, settling in Claygate where he was a popular and respected member of the community.</p> <p>Neighbour Jack Saltman said: \"They are quite beautiful kids and so well behaved. He was an extraordinarily nice man and helpful. He was a very tactile loving father. He loved to gather the girls up and cuddle them \u2026 they would go running at him and he'd catch them in his arms and kiss them. He adored them. His wife was a delightful person and I can't think why anybody would want to harm them.</p> <p>\"My wife is in floods of tears, she's heartbroken. When I stop to think about it I'll cry for those little kiddies. What sort of life are they going to have now?\"</p> <p>The foreign office said: \"Our consular officials are on the ground and providing full consular assistance. Very experienced consular staff have spent time with the youngest survivor to reassure her.\"</p> <p>Hilli is listed as being involved with two companies. Filings at Companies House say he is director of a company called SHTECH.</p> <p>The company dealt with computer aided mechanical design work, mainly in the civil aviation industry, said Hilli's accountant Julian Stedman.</p> <p>Hilli set up the company in 2001 and got most of his work through industry contacts. The company was \"doing well\", Stedman said. \"I knew he worked on [designing] the kitchen of the European Airbus.\"</p> <p>Saad and Ikbal got married in August 2003 and had Zainab two years later.</p>",

  "<p>If you can muscle your way to the head of the queue to see <em>Bronze</em>, the Royal Academy's big autumn exhibition, you will make a little piece of history by becoming the first gallery-goer ever to see all the pieces on display. The objects have been gathered from Europe and the Middle East, from Africa and Asia, and from North America to India. The earliest pieces in the show date from around 3,700BC and the latest from 2012. \"No one in the world has seen all these things displayed before,\" says one of the exhibition's two curators, the art historian David Ekserdjian. Not even him: before the packing cases were opened and the exhibits put in their cases there were \"as many as 50 out of the 150 items that I had only ever seen in photographs\".</p> <p>\"There is no such thing as a specialist for the entire span represented here,\" he says. \"It is really an anti-specialist show. What I hope for is that even experts will be knocked out by things they didn't expect. I want them to say: 'Blimey, what is <em>that</em>?'\" Ekserdjian believes that both the unfamiliarity and the quality of the exhibits will win over a public not instinctively drawn to sculpture. The RA's Anish Kapoor show of 2009 was an exception: \"When most people say 'Art',\" he says, \"they mean paintings and drawings.\"</p> <p>That such a survey hasn't been attempted before is, on reflection, remarkable. Bronze is a universal artistic medium, with only the Americas and Australasia not adopting it in deep history. A truer if less punchy name for the exhibition would be <em>Copper Alloy</em> since bronze is composed mainly of copper with varying degrees of tin, zinc or lead: these compounds have also been known as \"metallo\", brass and \"latten\". Whatever its exact composition, the metal's great advantage over stone is that it can adopt more radical poses, such as statues with outstretched arms and raised legs, without snapping under its own weight, and is nigh on indestructible.</p> <p>Bronze is also a material that has been used by almost every sculptor of note. Notable exceptions include the German Renaissance wood carver <a href=\"http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/tilmanintro.htm\" title=\"\">Tilman Riemenschneider</a> and the great Neoclassicist <a href=\"http://gallery.sjsu.edu/paris/the_academy/canova.htm\" title=\"\">Antonio Canova</a>. Although his only two known works are either lost or destroyed, Michelangelo sculpted in bronze while Leonardo spent years working on a gigantic equestrian statue of Francesco Sforza which was never completed because the bronze was appropriated to make cannon. The names of the artists who made the Benin heads from West Africa or the Buddhas from 8th-century Japan and 6th-century India may not be known, but they too were masters of the highest calibre. The list scrolls forward to include Henry Moore, Jasper Johns and Louise Bourgeois.</p> <p>One of the many appeals of bronze to artists is that it can take exceptionally fine detail. The most prevalent form of casting from antiquity onwards is the \"lost wax\" method in which a full-scale model, usually of clay, is coated in a layer of wax \u2013 on to which can be scraped the most delicate of effects \u2013 and then covered with a plaster mould. When the mould is heated the wax melts away and molten bronze can be poured into the gap. After cooling the metal is malleable enough to be further chased, chiselled, polished or treated with acid to give a variety of patinas. The Greeks would then add further details such as bone eyes with onyx pupils, silver teeth and copper lips and nipples.</p> <p>Casting large sculptures was nevertheless a highly skilled business: the 16th-century sculptor <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/101559/Benvenuto-Cellini\" title=\"\">Benvenuto Cellini</a> left an account of the difficulties he encountered in making his statue of Perseus holding the head of Medusa (now in the Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence). In firing his furnace to the necessary temperature, he set his studio roof alight and work continued in driving rain and wind, the strain and the heat caused him to catch a fever, the base of his mould flew off in an explosion and the copper congealed and would flow only once he threw all his household tin plates and cups into the melt. The statue that finally emerged was, however, perfect except for three missing toes. A reminder of Cellini's travails is included in the exhibition by the presence of a high-quality copy of the sculpture, made in 1844 for the Duke of Sutherland, which usually stands little visited in Trentham Gardens at Stoke-on-Trent.</p> <p>Despite the difficulties of casting, by the 5th century BC bronze was already the preferred material for free-standing sculptures across the Greek world. They were made in huge numbers. According to Pliny the Elder, the 4th-century sculptor Lysippos made 1,500 statues during his career and by 179BC there were so many bronzes on the Capitoline Hill in Rome that they obscured the view of the Temple of Jupiter and had to be taken down. When Rhodes fell to Muslim troops in AD653 the conquerors carried off 980 camel-loads of bronze from the destroyed Colossus. This highlights why there is so little evidence left of the profusion of bronze from the ancient world: unlike marble statues, bronze ones were simply melted down and reused. The destruction was so wholesale that, ironically, the best surviving bronzes are those that were lost at sea while being imported from Greece to Rome, such as the Riace bronzes, two warriors made in about 450BC that were discovered by a snorkeller 200 metres off the Calabrian coast in 1972.</p> <p>One of the most striking pieces in the exhibition is a piece that escaped destruction not by being buried at sea but in a tomb. It shows the head of King Seuthes III, who ruled Thrace as a subject king under Alexander the Great from 330 to 301BC. The bust shows a Hemingway-like man of power with a fierce gaze shooting out from beneath eyebrows of a tousled luxuriance that matches his beard and hair. This extraordinarily lifelike example of Hellenistic sculpture was unearthed in Bulgaria only in 2004, and has never previously been exhibited outside Sofia. It is not just a work of art of the highest order but a poignant symbol of just what marvels have been lost down the centuries.</p> <p>The exhibition is organised by theme rather than geography or chronology, so Seuthes will be displayed alongside other heads such as the late 14th-century <em>Head with Crown</em> from the lost city of Ife in Nigeria, showing a face of great serenity furrowed with delicate striations representing tribal markings; and Brancusi's <em>Dana\u00efde</em> of 1918, a smooth reduction of a female face with no eyes or mouth but elegant arches forming eyebrows and nose.</p> <p>The other sections \u2013 the human figure, animals, gods, groups, objects and reliefs \u2013 also reinforce the common motifs of artists regardless of time and place. The similarities emerge not just in expected areas such as idealising the nude or inspiring reverence in front of a saint or deity, but in quirkier ways too. For example, Giambologna's sculpture of a turkey, a riot of feathers and wattle, was made in 1567 and reflected something of his wonder at this strange bird introduced from the Americas only in 1511; but in its joyous spirit it belongs with Picasso's 1951 <em>Baboon and Young</em>, fashioned from an assemblage of everyday objects \u2013 cup handles, a jug and his son's toy car.</p> <p>One of the most intriguing pieces in the show is also one of the most modest. In 1896, at the end of the Anglo-Ashanti wars that had flared up periodically in West Africa during the 19th century, British troops came across a lidded bronze ewer. The remarkable thing about it, however, is that it was medieval English and dated circa 1390-1400. It is decorated with lions and lying stags, the emblems of Richard II, and around the belly of the jug read the words \"Suppose the best in every fear / Until the truth is known.\" How and when this item from the English royal household ended up in a royal palace in what is now Ghana is unknown. For Ekserdjian it is both a bronze equivalent of the Wilton Diptych and an example of the complicated trading links of the Middle Ages by which something like rock crystal from Madagascar ended up in Europe, even though Madagascar was not even known to exist. \"I think the Asante ewer may have made such a journey in reverse \u2013 or at least I like to think so.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395753494\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/9/6/1346936643845/Chimera-of-Arezzo-008.jpg\" alt=\"Chimera of Arezzo\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The <em>Chimera of Arezzo</em>, Etruscan, c400BC.

The aesthetic thrill is paramount.\" The RA has managed to gather pieces of astounding quality. \"Almost everything is an absolutely top piece.\" What helped is that even the oldest bronzes are relatively sturdy \u2013 at least in comparison with, say, panel paintings \u2013 and so can travel.</p> <p>When foreign galleries understood the scope of the exhibition they were happy to lend their star turns. So the <em>Chimera of Arezzo</em>, from about 400BC, is present. This fabulous beast composed of a lion, a goat and a serpent, is the most famous example of Etruscan art and was once owned by Cosimo de' Medici and restored by Cellini. Present too is Denmark's greatest national treasure, the haunting <a href=\"http://www.archeurope.com/index.php?page=trundholm-sun-chariot\" title=\"\">late bronze age <em>Chariot of the Sun</em> that was found in a peat bog at Trundholm</a>. It represents a wheeled horse pulling an incised disk, one side gilded to symbolise the sun, the other plain denoting night. It is a work of totemic power that can take the viewer across centuries into a different world and different belief system, when the daily passage of the sun across the heavens was a matter of both mystery and life and death.</p> <p>There is more to this exhibition, though, than just seeing some of the world's great artworks for the first time. The head of Seuthes III was found only eight years ago; the spectacular Roman <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2010/sep/13/roman-helmet-metal-detector-cumbria\" title=\"\">Crosby Garrett parade helmet</a> was unearthed in Cumbria in 2010; and only weeks ago, 40 years to the day after the Riace bronzes were discovered, further statues have been found at a shipwreck site 50 kilometres down the coast. \"Astounding bronzes are still emerging,\" says Ekserdjian: \"many more than Rembrandts are being found in attics.\" This show, with&#xa0;all its beauties, may eventually prove to be just scratching the surface of bronze.</p>",
  "<p>The power and expertise of the UK building industry was there for all to see as spectators gathered first for the Olympic Games and now for the Paralympics at the Olympic Park in Stratford.</p> <p>The efficiency of the whole construction effort for London 2012 has been rightly praised, and the Olympic stadium and other major venues stand as beacons for what UK industry can achieve.&#xa0;</p> <p>However, these are particularly challenging economic times. To improve value for money for taxpayers and enable the building industry to look at better ways of doing things, the government is reforming public sector construction procurement.</p> <p>After a period of price inflation in building costs running at almost twice the level of inflation, last year the coalition launched a new strategy to make public sector projects 15 to 20% cheaper by 2015 in real terms.&#xa0;</p> <p>A fundamental part of this transformation is the intelligent and open use of data. Believe it or not, until last year the government had no central cost data for all public building projects \u2013 there was no readily accessible data store to show how much we were paying to build roads, hospitals and schools.</p> <p>That's changed and, for the first time in history, the government publishes data revealing a pricing benchmark for large capital projects. For example, the data shows that, on average, it costs:&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2022 \u00a32,350 per square metre to build a new secondary school.</p> <p>\u2022 \u00a39.6m per kilometre to build each additional lane for major A road improvements.</p> <p>\u2022 \u00a32,120 per square metre to build a new primary care/community hospital.</p> <p>This is of much more than academic interest \u2013 the release of this data will have a transformational effect on the relationship between government and the building industry. It is being used to set budgets and make sure that value for money is a clear driver in launching projects. It also allows the government to articulate its needs more intelligently and pushes the industry to provide correspondingly intelligent solutions.</p> <p>Now that we know what projects should cost \u2013 and the industry knows how much we expect them to cost \u2013 we are challenging firms to \"beat the benchmark\" and innovate in ways that offer both lower cost and better value for money.</p> <p>By the same token, open benchmarking provides a check against costs falling too low. We need to know that firms are taking on projects that still allow them to make a healthy profit, to prosper, create more jobs and keep the economy moving. Making this data open to scrutiny ensures that we are not, inadvertently, supporting the practice of \"suicide bidding\" (bidding too low). We don't want to make savings at the expense of this vital industry, nor do we want projects to fail because of unrealistic pricing \u2013 we're interested in genuine efficiency and mutual advantage.</p> <p>Open data doesn't make a difference only to costs. Evidence gathered through the <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2010/Nov/government-launches-growth-review\" title=\"\">Growth Review in 2010</a> revealed how a lack of certainty and information about future government buying decisions weakened the ability of businesses to invest and prepare to win government contracts.&#xa0;</p> <p>We now <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/infrastructure_pipeline_data_update.htm\" title=\"\">publish data</a> on all planned construction and infrastructure projects, so that the industry knows where to invest, and government can spot any potential skills gaps.</p> <p>For example, the government's own analysis of the data showed that seven of the 40 priority infrastructure projects for growth require significant tunnelling expertise: the High Speed 2, Crossrail, Thames Tideway Tunnel, Northern Line extension, London Underground capital programme, National Grid cable tunnels and the new nuclear programme.</p> <p>We calculated that by 2015-16 there will be around 4,000 jobs in direct tunnelling and underground construction, and that the latest estimates from the British Tunnelling Society show that demand for these skills could outstrip supply by 2015. Armed with this information, the government was able to explore new training and apprenticeship measures, as well as additional skills training for 500 existing underground construction workers and how to support sponsorship of higher level degree courses that will attract UK students.</p> <p>Publishing data on what we plan to buy \u2013 whether it's tunnels, schools or computers \u2013 is far from a cosmetic exercise. It allows us to get a better deal, to support stronger industries, to spot skills gaps sooner and put UK businesses in a better position to compete. Long may the data revolution continue.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

Perhaps you are a bit of an amateur movie maker yourself? Don't knock a Nokia camera until you have tried it \u2013 or watched the promotional video.</p> <p>We've got two examples from Nokia this week and you will soon see why. The company was so proud of the Pureview branding on its Lumia 920 with optical image stabilisation (OIS) that it produced <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=cimDfEIEiu0#\">a long promotional video</a> extolling its benefits. The only problem was that some of the footage wasn't shot on the Lumia 920 \u2013 but by another camera positioned inside a white van. Cue video number two \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pytmZV0Qs7s&amp;feature=player_detailpage\">a much truncated version of the promo</a>. Someone at Nokia has probably been shot for that.</p> <p>There will be plenty of shots on Sky Movies, which is rolling out a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=m2FAWb5Lch8\">007 HD series and launches it with a clip </a>featuring all six Bonds in one exhilarating car chase sequence using footage from Dr No, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, The Spy Who Loved Me, The Living Daylights, GoldenEye, The World Is Not Enough and Quantum of Solace.</p> <p>We've got some Paralympic action for you this week too \u2013 from the sublime to the ridiculous. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riR_SyhvB6s&amp;feature=player_embedded\">A stunning shot from table tennis player David Wetherill </a> contrasts with the chancellor, George Osborne, looking suitably sheepish as he is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM0Ube0oLs\">booed by the crowd </a>during a medal ceremony.</p> <p>Finally no compilation would be complete without some animal antics. This week it's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xD2AhMBNog&amp;feature=player_detailpage\">a caterpillar with a definite death wish</a> and a couple of very <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VuMdLm0ccU&amp;feature=player_detailpage\">cute hamsters spinning out of control</a>. Happy viewing!</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Kvw7J26V68U?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Kvw7J26V68U\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>Guardian Viral Video Chart.
