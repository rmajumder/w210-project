  "<p>Premier League clubs have signed eight players for fees of \u00a310m or more. Here those who know them well give the lowdown on them and whether they will be successful in England</p> <h2>Eden Hazard, Chelsea, \u00a332m</h2> <p><strong>Marouane Fellaini, Belgium team-mate</strong></p> <p>Eden is a talent and he knows it. That is quality. He needs to get confidence but he is also very self-assured and never feels any pressure. He played two exceptional seasons in France and it means something if you are chosen as the player of the year there. He does not have to fear the competition at Chelsea because he is ready. He is the biggest talent in Belgium. Maybe he does not defend a lot but sometimes you need people to work for him. He is fast, creative, moves well and can make the difference. He has everything to succeed in England.</p> <h2>Oscar, Chelsea, \u00a320m</h2> <p><strong>Fernando Duarte, O Globo</strong></p> <p>With the hit-and-miss history of Brazilian imports at the Premier League, it is natural for some to wonder how well Oscar dos Santos J\u00fanior will do for Chelsea. After all, apart from being only 20, the midfielder will arrive at Stamford Bridge under a lot of scrutiny to find some tough competition for places, since the London club have brought similar young talent for the team rebuilding job.</p> <p>But the main challenge for Oscar will be the physicality of the Premiership. He is far from a beefed-up player and it has been noticed the Brazilian can sometimes drift off games when the aggression levels rise. However, the mere fact people in his country seem to have forgotten about the former midfielder wunderkind Paulo Henrique Ganso shows how well rated he is.</p> <h2>Shinji Kagawa, Manchester United, \u00a317m</h2> <p><strong>Thorsten Schabelon, Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung</strong></p> <p>Shinji Kagawa has speed: he can move fast and change direction fast. He is technically very good and, if you put that together, as a defender, it is hard to think what he will do next. He is always doing something that you do not anticipate: Kagawa is unpredictable.</p> <p>He will have no problem with the big games. Borussia Dortmund's biggest match is at Schalke 04. In September 2010, Kagawa's first season there, he scored twice and created the third in a 3-1 win. When the coach returned to Dortmund there were hundreds of fans waiting, they carried him out of the bus and put him on their shoulders. He said it was his craziest moment at the club. So if he plays at, say, Liverpool, Kagawa will be very calm.</p> <h2>Olivier Giroud, Arsenal, \u00a313m</h2> <p><strong>Bruno Constant, L'Equipe</strong></p> <p>Two years ago nobody knew Olivier Giroud but, in a single season, he enjoyed a meteoric rise: becoming a league champion with Montpellier, the top scorer of the league (21), earning a call-up to the French national team and signing for Arsenal. Like his club-mate Laurent Koscielny he has arrived at a high level very late and was playing in Ligue 2 two years ago. But he is hungry, is physically imposing at 6ft 4in, but also mobile and clever with his movement, with his game adapting all the time.</p> <p>He scored on his first start for France in Germany (2-1, 29 February 2012) and many would have liked to have seen him starting more often at Euro 2012. For his first game with Arsenal in Cologne (4-0) he appeared very comfortable and in 45 minutes created four chances for Cazorla and his new team-mates.</p> <p>You can never be sure a striker will settle in England but I'm convinced Giroud will. He's got everything: height, physical impact, power, he is clever and has a great ability in front of goal. He will bring power and presence in the last third in a team that has lacked a focal point from crosses. With Giroud they can be sure they have a target man. Arsenal will be able to vary more their game and play a more direct football when they struggle. English clubs do not know him and he could be very dangerous.</p> <h2>Santi Cazorla, Arsenal, \u00a312m</h2> <p><strong>Cayetano Ros, El Pa\u00eds</strong></p> <p>Senna, the club captain, said it was like Villarreal had had a finger cut off. But it was worse than that. The departure of Cazorla took Villarreal's soul and sent them to the Second Division. That was when people appreciated his true importance to Villarreal. And it was underlined again a year later when he took M\u00e1laga to Champions League qualification for the first time. Small and crafty, Cazorla learnt to take on the leadership of his clubs, founded on two principles: dressing room harmony and the ambition to play aesthetic football. Technically, he is supremely talented. His control of the ball is complete with both feet, he strikes it equally well with his left and his right. He loves to play a short, tight game because he is quick over small distances and skilful with the ball. Yet he can play a longer game, too, an expert in switching the direction of the play with cross-field passes, and he is an expert from set plays.</p> <p>He has all the qualities necessary to become the new idol of the Gunners and a real favourite for his coach, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who has always embraced players of his style. Cazorla can play as the second central midfielder or in either if the interior positions (inside-right, inside-left). With time, he has learnt to sacrifice himself in the recovery of possession. He will mix well with [Jack] Wilshere. There is just one potential problem: he may not find it easy to learn another language and English will sound like Chinese to him to start with. But the smile is permanent and always ready to break down barriers.</p> <h2>Lukas Podolski, Arsenal, \u00a310.9m</h2> <p><strong>Raphael Honigstein, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung</strong></p> <p>He is not overtly technical, he is very direct and he prefers to shoot from distance rather than to look for the umpteenth lay-off: Lukas Podolski is perhaps not your stereotypical Arsenal player. And that is perhaps not a bad thing either.</p> <p>The Polish-born German international can play in an array of forward positions and score from all of them. Usually used wide out left by Joachim L\u00f6w. FC K\u00f6ln saw him lead the line on his own in devastating fashion. Eighteen league goals for one of the Bundesliga's most negative outfits spoke of his new-found maturity and consistency.</p> <h2>Fabio Borini, Liverpool, \u00a310m</h2> <p><strong>Alessandro Catapano, La Gazzetta dello Sport</strong></p> <p>Borini is a modern striker who can cover defensively. Technically he is no [Lionel] Messi but he is good at everything, extremely flexible and can play deep and on the flanks. Moreover, he does not complain when asked to change roles. I would argue the Premier League, which demands a mix of athleticism and technique, is perfect for him, and he has the experience already from playing at Swansea. He is also, from my experience, an extremely nice, and serious, player. He avoided too much partying with the other Roma players last season, claiming he wanted to concentrate on getting results, and this saw him marginalised in the dressing room.</p> <h2>Jan Vertonghen, Tottenham, \u00a310m</h2> <p><strong>Bart Vlietstra, NUsport magazine</strong></p> <p>I already miss Jan and I told him so after the Belgium-Holland game on Wednesday. Why? Because he made it fun to watch Ajax. He towered above strikers, helped his full-backs with tackles, provided his wingers with cross-field passes, struck for goal with his left foot and, most excitingly, stepped out with the ball to rush at opposing defences. He said he hoped to continue doing this at Tottenham. I also miss Jan because he is intelligent, humorous and ready to speak his mind in interviews. He is cultured and London clubs have always been high on his list. He often talked about Arsenal but knew that his friend Thomas Vermaelen would be in the way. He senses opportunity at Tottenham.</p>",
  "<p>In his recent verse on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCfoj2VDqZ4\">Rick Ross's 3 Kings</a>, Jay-Z (worth $460m) took boasting about his opulent life to a whole new level. \"Millions on the walls in all my rooms/Niggas couldn't fuck with my daughter's room/Niggas couldn't walk in my daughter's socks/Banksy, bitches/Basquiats,\" he informs us. Yes, Blue Ivy is so rich she probably didn't even have to go on Wikipedia to find out who Basquiat was. On the same track, Dr Dre also name-checks a few of the ways he can pop to the post office: \"G5s to '64s/Dre got em\u2026 Bentley coupe/New yacht/My helicopter\". Well, he couldn't have taken the <em>old</em> yacht.</p> <p>But they're American. Us Brits would never be so crude. Talk about money? Please. That's like queue-jumping, or accepting a compliment: just so classless. So step forward Tinie Tempah, pop's most budget rapper.</p> <p>Tinie's latest verse, on Ellie Goulding's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap-A0RKhi2s\">Hanging On</a>, features a name-check for everyone's favourite over-the-counter antacid brand Gaviscon. Or, as Tinie puts it, \"She broke my heart/I took some g-g-g-g-Gaviscon\". Maybe it's an attempt to get a crate sent to him for free (after all, he can't just pop to Boots \u2013 the cashier might @ him on Twitter, telling the world that the man behind Pass Out has had a rich dinner and as a result is experiencing a spot of heartburn). Also, Tinie needs to read the back of the packet: it's good for excess stomach acid, but useless for a broken heart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394836736\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/15/1345049513227/Henry-vac-004.jpg\" alt=\"Henry vac\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Henry vac - just the thing to suck up all those Pringles crumbs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Right now, Tinie is probably sitting at home, on a crate of Kestrel (which he mentions on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-FWDsXUCes\">Wonderman</a>), with his feet up on a box of Vaseline (his guest spot on Chase &amp; Status's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jh-xcKazSk\">Hitz</a>), reading a Nigella Lawson book from Borders (Hitz and Rita Ora's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1l9WST5lXM\">RIP</a>), watching QVC (Swedish House Mafia's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCH1AsUydSc\">Miami 2 Ibiza</a>), and eating Pringles (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNyYomM2VQY\">Simply Unstoppable</a>). If Tinie accidentally drops a crisp, he'd be spoilt for choice on how to clear it up \u2014 both Dyson and Henry Hoover get a mention on his album Disc-Overy.</p> <p>But following that high-profile Olympics closing ceremony slot, with his second album due later this year, will Tinie stay budget? After all, it's harder to break the States if you're constantly explaining to audiences what Findus Crispy Pancakes and M&amp;S pants are. Imagine how his rumoured duet with Rihanna could turn out: while she's singing about how much we all want to have sex with her, Tinie's got a few lines on how pleased he is to be there, and does anyone fancy a nice cheese and pickle sandwich he bought in the Boots' meal deal?</p> <p>I hope Tinie sticks to his thrifty principles, because if he changes his references, he changes who he is. After all, this is a man who once boasted that he had so many clothes he \"keeps them at [his] aunt's house\", the most rubbish attempt at showing off in the history of rap. So stay budget, Tinie, and remember it's BOGOF loo roll in Morrisons this week.</p>",
  "<p>The influence that Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King had in forcing out Bob Diamond as chief executive of Barclays illustrates the need for tougher oversight of the central bank, a powerful committee of MPs concludes in a report on the Libor-rigging scandal.</p> <p>The 122 page report by the Treasury select committeedescribes the culture of Barclays as having \"gone badly awry\" but said the governor's involvement was \"difficult to justify\" given that he does not yet have responsibility for regulating banks.</p> <p>King, who appeared before MPs last month, made clear that he did not demand Diamond's resignation<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/27/barclays-chief-bob-diamond-bonus-fine\" title=\"\"> following the \u00a3290m fine on Barclays</a> for attempting to manipulate interest rates. However, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/10/barclays-warned-fsa-agius-diamond-bonus\" title=\"\">he summoned the bank's chairman, Marcus Agius,</a> and his deputy Sir Michael Rake to tell them that regulators had lost confidence in Diamond in the wake of Libor-fixing fine.</p> <p>King spoke to the two Barclays boardroom directors on the day that Agius had announced his resignation. Agius had resigned after a conversation with Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, who had left their talks believing that it was Diamond who would quit, not Agius. Turner's inability to get his message across is also criticised.</p> <p>\"Whatever the merits of the action taken by the governor of the Bank of England and chairman of the FSA - and this committee has sympathy with the conclusion that they had drawn about the leadership of Barclays - the action they took has exposed implicit, and potentially arbitrary power, to force out senior figures in the financial services industry,\" the report said.</p> <p>\"The return of the 'governor's eyebrows' - which many will welcome on this occasion - comes with the need for corporate governance safeguards,\" the report said.</p> <p>Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, said the report \"has called for action in a number of areas, including higher fines for firms that fail to co-operate with regulators, the need to examine gaps in the criminal law, and a much stronger governance framework at the Bank of England\". The Bank of England pointed out that the Financial Services bill was setting out new governance structures for the central bank.</p> <p>The report criticised the Barclays board for presiding over \"a deeply flawed culture\" that allowed attempts to manipulate Libor to begin in 2005. The bank stressed that it had now announced a review of business practices. \"While we don't expect to agree with every finding in [the report], we recognise that change is required, not least to restore stakeholder trust,\" a Barclays spokesman said.</p> <p>The report is also critical of the FSA's slow approach to investigating Libor, which was two years behind the US. Andrew Bailey, the top regulator at the FSA, attended the Barclays board meeting in February to outline concerns and Turner had followed this up with a letter in April to the bank's chairman.</p> <p>\"It will be a great step forward if the regulators get away from box-ticking and endless data collection and instead devote more careful thought to where risk really lies. This could reduce the regulatory burden and, at the same time, provide more effective oversight. It will involve a change in culture on the part of the regulators and is a major challenge for the future,\" Tyrie said.</p> <p>This was welcomed by the FSA, which is being disbanded next year when banking regulation will be handed to the Bank of England. \"We welcome the committee's report and their view that the new judgement led approach to regulation being delivered by the FSA is the right one,\" an FSA spokesman said.</p> <p>The report indicated that a new area for consideration by the new cross-party parliamentary commission on banking standards, which is being chaired by Tyrie, is the leadership style of chief executives.</p> <p>\"The parliamentary commission on banking standards' examination of the corporate governance of systemically important financial institutions should consider how to mitigate the risk that the leadership style of a chief executive may permit a lack of effective challenge or to the firm committing strategic mistakes,\" the report said.</p> <p>For the first time, the report produced evidence by John Varley, the chief executive of Barclays during the Libor rigging scandal. Varley left in January 2011 when Diamond, who had been head of investment banking, replaced him. One focus of the inquiry was a file note that Diamond wrote to Varley, copied to Jerry del Missier, a close colleague. The note outlined a conversation with Paul Tucker of the Bank of England during the October 2008 crisis, which Del Missier interpreted as an instruction to cut the bank's Libor submissions. Del Missier quit the bank on the same day as Diamond.</p> <p>Varley told the MPs in written evidence that he rang Lord Myners, the former City minister, Sir John Gieve, then a deputy governor of the Bank of England, and Hector Sants, then chief executive of the FSA, after reading Diamond's note. He had emailed Diamond to say \"we should discuss\" this, but did not recall any further correspondence.</p> <p>The MPs concluded that Barclays \"did not need a nod, a wink or any signal from the Bank of England to lower artificially their Libor submissions\" as it was already doing so, even before the October 2008 crisis.</p>",
  "<p>The news this week that the Dandy's 75th anniversary issue in December would be its last in print must have been a blow to its readers, but at least they had the consolation of knowing it would continue online. For some of us, this summer has only reminded us how much we have lost.</p> <p>Piked back-dive. Somersault in tuck position. As Tom Daley won his bronze, a host of women in their 30s and 40s \u2013 like me \u2013 were able to show off our surprisingly exhaustive knowledge of diving terms. Many of us had never been near a diving board in our lives \u2013 but back in 1981 we were glued to the adventures of Diving Belle in the comic Jinty and Penny. That's the one where school champion Belle McBane vows never to dive again after her father is lost at sea, but a mystic Gypsy persuades her to train in secret, leading to Belle diving off an oil rig and finding her father, who's trapped in a bathyscope with only an hour's worth of oxygen left. Phew!</p> <p>Then there was gymnastics, whose bar, floor and beam were no mystery to the thousands of us who grew up with Tammy's Bella Barlow, the orphan gymnast who still managed a big smile despite her many, many troubles (selfish aunt and uncle, loss of memory, homelessness, arrests, cheating rivals, blackmail, injuries and unwittingly causing an anti-gymnastics uprising in the Kingdom of Ramaski, to name but a few).</p> <p>Diving and gymnastics weren't the only Olympic events enhanced by a grounding in girls' comics. Name almost any sport (well, maybe not wrestling or modern pentathlon) and there was once a comic-strip heroine who excelled at it. It didn't matter if, in real life, you were last to be picked for hockey or, like June's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessie_Bunter\" title=\"\">Bessie Bunter</a>, preferred biscuits to beach volleyball and cake to canoeing. In the 1970s and 80s, comics \u2013 or \"picture-story papers\", as they called themselves \u2013 drew their readers effortlessly into other worlds, whether competitive sport, Victorian slums or alien planets.</p> <p>There were usually medals all round in the final episode of a sporting story \u2013 but that didn't mean our heroines had an easy ride getting there. We're used to the sob stories of the wannabe-famous on The X Factor. Ha! Reality-show contestants haven't got anything on girls' comic characters, who had to overcome unbelievable obstacles to achieve their goals. It didn't take the comics' (usually male) editors long to work out that girls just loved wallowing in misery. The story titles flaunt their heroine's sufferings: Tears of a Clown; The Girl the World Forgot; Bridey Below the Breadline; No One Cares for Cora; Lisa \u2013 the Lonely Ballerina; The Sadness of Happy Jones; Merry at Misery House. There were Slaves of, variously, the Mirror (orphan girl is hypnotised into destroying her sister's boarding house), the Candle (Victorian candlemaker enslaves girls and tries to steal the Crown Jewels), Form 3B (meek&#xa0;girl is hypnotised by scheming classmate), the Clock (reluctant ballerina is forced to dance whenever she hears a clock ticking), the Dolls (girl is turned into servant for the inhabitants of a Victorian dolls' house) and the Swan (amnesiac girl is forced to work for injured ballerina).</p> <p>Beloved animals were threatened with death. Miscarriages of justice saw girls ostracised by their schoolmates and innocent fathers put in prison. Girls were forbidden to do the one thing \u2013 music, swimming, horse-riding \u2013 that meant everything to them. Dystopian futures were rife (and occasionally prescient \u2013 Jinty's Fran of the Floods saw civilisation \"almost brought to an end by gigantic floods and freak weather\", while Land of No Tears showed a world where the disabled were treated as second-class citizens). Homeless orphans (often with sick little brothers in tow) dealt stoically with obstacles that would horrify even Tess of the d'Urbervilles.</p> <p>And, like Hardy's heroine, these girls didn't always get a happy ending. Consider Karen Chalmers, Tammy and Misty's The Loneliest Girl in the World, who after many traumatic episodes finally discovers that she is the only survivor of a holocaust \u2013 and, knowing this, goes to her certain death in order to&#xa0;see her parents one last time. We'd waited weeks for that revelation, only to&#xa0;be given shrieking nightmares.</p> <p>That wait! We had to wait a week for each episode! It was torture, but oh, the anticipation \u2026 The skill involved in creating these comics shouldn't be underestimated. The creators weren't just breaking a story into little bits and illustrating it; these tales were impeccably crafted \u2013 told episodically, every three- or four-page section gripping the readers and moving the story on, ending on a cliffhanger to bring them back next week (and to make sure they never cancelled their subscription \u2013 not that you would ever fill in the \"Please, Mr Newsagent, I want to place a regular order\" coupon because it would mean cutting up your comic). Not all the stories were works of art, and not all were to everyone's taste. But there was such variety that every reader could find a diamond among what she \u2013 or he \u2013 might consider dross.</p> <p>Yes, there were male readers, too. Although these comics were aimed primarily at girls (<a href=\"http://girlscomicsofyesterday.com/\" title=\"\">Bunty</a>, Tracy, Mandy, Judy, Nikki, Sandie, Debbie, Diana, Sally, June, Tammy, Jinty, Lindy, Penny: the clue was in the names), that didn't mean they weren't appreciated by boys, even if it couldn't be admitted to in the playground. Steve Cole, author of the Astrosaurs series of kids' science fiction books, used to sneak a look at his elder sister's comics. \"They seemed to me like little windows into girls' lives and loves and interests,\" he recalls. \"Bunty, Jinty and, best of all, Misty. Misty was hardcore and scared the hell out of me: not just for all the ghosts, zombies and eerie beings that haunted its pages, but because its stories eschewed happy endings with a bitter relish. The heroines, or usually antiheroines, who populated its strips and text stories had only to betray the tiniest fault or foible and that was it \u2013 they would die horribly, or be disfigured, or be transported to an unholy realm of evil. Redemption came rarely to these unfortunate schoolgirls. 'Come, gather the sweets of the other side of midnight with your friend of the mists,' the floaty-white-dress-wearing vixen would suggest on her splash page at the front. 'I seek always the spine-tingling shudders of true nightmare.' Well, you couldn't deny she laid her weirdo cards on the table and, beguiled by her spooky glamour, I went with her gladly.\"</p> <p>Ah, Misty. Although every reader thinks her own comic era is the best, there really was something special about the late-70s/early-80s IPC/Fleetway triumvirate of Tammy, Jinty and <a href=\"http://www.26pigs.com/misty/\" title=\"\">Misty</a>. Between them they created a love of narrative, a passion for justice and possibly a need for therapy (at least according to my husband) that persists for life, and that last is mainly down to \"your friend from the mists\". Although only lasting two years before it was swallowed up by its cannibalistic sister Tammy (who would later consume Jinty, as well), Misty made its mark like few others. It wasn't the first girls' comic to focus on the supernatural \u2013 Misty launched only a few weeks after <a href=\"http://www.dcthomson.co.uk/\" title=\"\">DC Thomson</a>'s similarly themed Spellbound was merged with Debbie \u2013 but it was the first to embrace it so intensely, so darkly. No ballet here; instead there were pacts with the devil, schoolgirl sacrifice, the ghosts of hanged girls, sinister cults, evil scientists experimenting on the innocent and terrifying parallel worlds where the Nazis won the second world war.</p> <p>Within Misty's pages, the slightest moral flaw led to suffering and/or death \u2013 and readers lapped it up. When a letter called for the comic to be banned after it printed a story in which two girls who were cruel to a mouse ended up as pets in a pet shop, other girls wrote in droves to disagree. The offending correspondent was told to stick to \"soppy comics\" with \"goody-goody stories about girls doing well at school\", while others pointed out the moral message and argued that if there were more comics like Misty, there might be less crime in&#xa0;the world.</p> <p>It's a good point. The cult Australian soap Prisoner: Cell Block H once featured a \"Scare them straight\" scheme where girls who had committed crimes were taught the error of their ways by the prison inmates. It would have been a lot cheaper just to buy them all a copy of Misty and let them be scared straight by its tales of the horrific fates that were in store for all girls who broke the law.</p> <p>Comics weren't all doom and gloom. There were school hijinks aplenty with Jinty's The Jinx from St Jonah's and Pam of Pond Hill, Judy's Bobby Dazzler and, of course, Bunty's eternal schoolgirls The Four Marys, among others. There were sitcoms such as Gaye's Gloomy Ghost, The No-Good Gnome, Jeanie and her Uncle Meanie and Sue's Fantastic Fun-Bag (no laughing at the back, there), and often the escapades of some cartoon character \u2013 Penny's Blunder Girl, Princess's Sadie-in-waiting, Sandie's Brenda's Brownies \u2013 who wouldn't have been out of place in Whizzer and Chips or the Beano. But the laughs didn't last. The story of comics has an ending as unhappy as many of their own stories.</p> <p>IPC's Tammy was cancelled in 1984, nominally merged with Girl, but making little impression on its new parent (Girl, a stepping stone between the traditional \"picture-story papers\" and the teen mags, such as Jackie and Blue Jeans, had photo-stories, boyfriends, pop stars and problem pages, alongside its occasional illustrated story). Girl only just saw out the decade before being scrapped. DC Thomson clung on for longer with Bunty and M&amp;J still going in the 90s, but even Bunty, godmother of all girls' comics, published its last issue in 2001.</p> <p>Boys' comics fared no better, and out of the \"fun\" comics only the Beano and Dandy remain. The DFC, an attempt to revive story papers, folded in 2009 after less than a year \u2013 although it was resurrected in January 2012 as The Phoenix, and is still burning brightly.</p> <p>Tastes change, the world moves on. No one expects otherwise. Were these comics old-fashioned? Middle-class? Maybe. But, as with E Nesbit, Noel Streatfeild or Enid Blyton, that doesn't dilute the pull of their stories. The trouble is, Nesbit, Streatfeild and Blyton wrote books. Even if out of print, their tales can be found via libraries, secondhand book shops or the internet. But comics were seen as disposable. If it's a crime that there are practically no comics like these left, it's perhaps even more of a crime that their wonderful stories are inaccessible, bar a few in \"best of\" compilations, to all but collectors.</p> <p>They're ignored as a resource, too. The film The Three Faces of Eve won an Oscar, so why not try a film of <a href=\"http://mistycomic.co.uk/The_Best_Of_2.html\" title=\"\">Misty's The Four Faces of Eve</a>, in which Eve discovers she's been constructed from the broken corpses of three dead girls? Who wouldn't want to see what sort of TV series Joss Whedon or Steven Moffat could make out of Jinty and Penny's Worlds Apart (the best comic story ever), in which six girls find themselves in a series of nightmarish worlds created out of their deepest desires or fears, and can only escape with the death of each world's protagonist? Fans of The Hunger Games would surely lap up a film or novelisation of Jinty's The Human Zoo, the story of twins Shona and Jenny who are taken to an alien world where humans are treated like animals \u2013 kept as pets, hunted and experimented on.</p> <p>My five-year-old children adore the weekly ritual of getting a comic. The comics they pick up may be mainly devoted to TV characters or superheroes or collectible monster franchises, and have a plastic free gift taped to the cover&#xa0;as a draw, but they're still loved. I&#xa0;promised myself that when they were older, I'd take out a subscription to a weekly fun comic or story paper that was full of original characters and brilliant tales. But with the loss of the Dandy, that genre moves ever closer to&#xa0;extinction.</p>",

  "<p>The conversation starts with someone's wife; she's reading Fifty Shades of Grey. First there's the critique of the prose style, then there's the bit where they say it's outsold Harry Potter and then \u2026 and then there's the smile. The smile that draws the women together into a huddle, the twinkly smile that says we're going there. The men adopt different faces. Our faces say we don't really want to go there, if that's OK? Can we return to talking about how glad we are that we did/didn't pay for private education, or how odd The Archers has become \u2026 anything that doesn't involve weird sex. Then someone's wife says they know a woman who bought the balls \u2026</p> <p>The Fifty Shades of Grey phenomenon is seeping into family life. It's like Jamie's Kitchen and The Contented Little Baby Book all over again. It's not only making the school gates and dinner parties a minefield of awkwardness, it's affecting our, you know, inter-personal intimacy of the most private nature.</p> <p>Pre-Shades, having any sex at all in a household with young children in it, made you wildly proud and smug. Family life is terrific for board games on Sunday afternoons, trips to Pizza Express and alphabet-based car games, but sex? Not&#xa0;so much.</p> <p>Typically sex takes place on a Saturday morning. My wife and I find ourselves alone in the kitchen; a series of nods and muttered arrangements pass between us. We check that the children are still bingeing on Simpsons cartoons and \u2013 being careful not to become engrossed ourselves \u2013 slope upstairs. We don't exactly creep but neither would we say anything like, \"Hey, we're just going upstairs!\"</p> <p>We are then, obviously, lost in the sensual feast. But we're also listening out for the scampering footsteps. These mean either that Simpsons episode is one of the boring film pastiche ones or else so brilliant that the kids are coming to tell us how brilliant it is. Essentially, our Saturday morning encounters depend on TV being absorbing but not outstanding.</p> <p>Now a troubling new element has been introduced into our fragile sexual eco-system. Our incredible between one-and-three-times-a-week average is no longer an astonishing tribute to our raging libidos, it is \"vanilla\".</p> <p>It doesn't matter if your partner hasn't read it \u2013 mine hasn't \u2013 it's everywhere. It's like a weird reversal of all that is British and normal: sex with props and pain and special rooms has clanked and limped out of its subterranean club scene and into the book bit at the supermarket.</p> <p>For years men have been portrayed as constantly sexually unsatisfied, barely restraining our roving, rampant needs. We like to perpetuate&#xa0;this mythology, never imagining that our partners would want to test the theory. And now there is the odd phenomenon of millions of women enjoying a book filled with detailed fantasies of acts outside the scope of their husbands' experience.</p> <p>So the Fifty Shades husband is asking himself, \"How can I compete with that?\" He laughs along with her hints and winks but he is afraid \u2013 and tired. The woman who shares the pesto-pasta, cups-of-decaf-tea reality of his daily life suddenly wants \u2026 more.</p> <p>Partly the problem is men. We love domination, cross-dressing, gimp masks and acts of non-consensual sodomy \u2013 as mainstays of our humour. The pose is that we know about the darker side of life and, as men of the world with insatiable appetites of our own, we naturally make lazy adolescent jokes about it.</p> <p>In a way the book \u2013 I've read it for research purposes \u2013 paints an arid picture of a life far from domesticity, and for that reason I can see where it's reputation as \"mummy porn\" comes from. Christian Grey and Ana live in a world without intimacy, homework and the need to put out the recycling because it's a Thursday.</p> <p>The spirit of experimentation introduced by the book brings another impossible complication to the lives of men. What was a natural, uncomplicated process suddenly requires kit and planning. And the British male, on the whole, sees planning as a useful tool for weddings, large IT projects and international conflict \u2013 but not for sex.</p> <p>My advice, though, is not to retreat back into the safe world of marital routine entirely. My cautious, usually drunken, conversations with my fellow fathers suggest that for many couples sex has drifted as a priority. The real \u2013 and I think tremendously positive \u2013 effect of Fifty Shades is to remind everyone what a warm, funny, loving and enjoyable part of married life sex can be. What the mummies really want is not a millionaire with a pain room but for their partners to linger more attentively over intimate moments and a willingness to experiment a bit rather than stick to years-old habits. Generally, I thank EL James for reminding us all to encourage the children to watch a lot more of the Simpsons.</p> <p><em>Tim Peel is a pseudonym</em><br></p>",
  "<p>As I walk on to the set of Vic and Bob's new show Lucky Sexy Winners, a runner is practising lunges across the stage while sporting a cutout of Simon Cowell's repugnantly muscular torso. In the background, an illustration of Miranda Hart's face glows on a big screen above a desk where four bronze legs dangle from a cluster of cogs. The show's producer is explaining to a cameraman that \"he slays Xena with a sword, then she crawls away,\" next to another woman who's furiously unwrapping table tennis bats. A stubbled hunk focuses his attentions on one of the show's sexy dancers, who turns out to be Dan Skinner, the man behind gurnsome plastic bag-carrier Angelos Epithemiou (he later comes to life as a middle-class Viking called John Meringue). A man tugs on a rope that strings together a whole family of tiny mechanical swans, and fake eyelashes are adjusted on a boombox.</p> <p>Before rehearsals for the show begin, however, Vic Reeves (real name Jim Moir) and Bob Mortimer sit in the courtyard of the BBC. This location could be considered strange for the pair, since, after 18 years of thigh-rubbing, dove-cooing and celeb molestation, the corporation axed Shooting Stars, explaining, \"In the future there will be less space on BBC2 for comedy/entertainment panel shows.\" The media statement equivalent of the \"It's not you, it's me\" card, basically.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394857476\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/15/1345045315121/Lucky-Sexy-Winners-002.jpg\" alt=\"Lucky Sexy Winners\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lucky Sexy Winners.

It couldn't be better timed. As much as Vic and Bob possess a cult-like legacy, they're in need of a contemporary spruce. When they first arrived at Channel 4 in the 90s, televised comedy was a more anarchic place to be, but in 2012 the cocked-legged, pint-swilling frivolities of their unhinged performances are a stark contrast to the clean-cut comics that currently soak up the BBC's allotted hours.</p> <p>\"We're old news now,\" Bob begins, sipping his hot chocolate. \"It's hard to get a channel behind you. We're not the new kids on the block any more.\" He smiles, matter-of-factly. \"It's not a great commission for them, personally, to put bloody Vic and Bob on.\"</p> <p>Bob is wrong. Although the pair's return may not bring sky-rocket ratings, they're an excellent commission. British television is currently bereft of awe-inspiring, surrealist humour, and we need more of it. As the antithesis of Russell Howard or Michael McIntyre \u2013 the men who catapulted observational comedy into rock-star arenas \u2013 Vic and Bob now represent abstract underdogs.</p> <p>Throughout the interview, Jim keeps a pair of aviator-style sunglasses on, which, alongside his patterned shirt and slicked-back hair, makes him look like Hunter S Thompson, if Hunter S Thompson had grown up in Leeds and drunk Guinness instead of absinthe. He's more intimidating than you'd expect, Bob being the softer, more obliging of the two, emphasised by his winter-dad top half (grey jumper and shirt) and summer-dad bottom bit (shorts). The look is punctuated by a pair of brown Chelsea boots, which display his astonishingly muscular calves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394857477\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/15/1345045488855/Dan-Skinner-as-John-Merin-004.jpg\" alt=\"Dan Skinner as John Meringue\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dan Skinner as John Meringue.

I'm pretty good in that respect, it just comes out of the back end,\" Jim grins. \"You can hide that a bit more. Well, there are pads.\"</p> <p>\"I wear my wife's pads.\" Bob adds, his mouth full of ginger nut, before trying to remember what they're called. \"Care Frees? Have A Good Time? Keep On Trucking Pads?\"</p> <p>They decide on Get Comfortable. Bob cackles, flashing a mouth full of gold infrastructure, perhaps attributable to the seven sugars he has in his tea.</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>\"I like questions about waste disposal. But talking about ourselves? It's a menace\"</strong></h2> <p><br>At times, interviewing Vic and Bob can be tricky. Questions are obsolete when they'd rather take you off on a 10-minute tangent about pickled onions.</p> <p>As well as that, Jim will turn his body, a bit like a cat, so he's looking at the wall next to us, his humming brain going about its business until a snippet of conversation takes his fancy.</p> <p>Do they have much interest in self-promotion?</p> <p>\"I don't mind. I like talking to people,\" Jim quickly responds.</p> <p>\"We don't, Jim, let's be honest. Who was the chap? Nice bloke, used to be a journalist. You know. Nice fella.\"</p> <p>Jim suggests a man named Robert Wilkie.</p> <p>\"It could be Robert Wilkie but it isn't. I remember him interviewing us and he just had questions about waste disposal.

They've enjoyed both cult and mainstream success with their skewed slapstick applied to sketch shows (The Smell Of Reeves And Mortimer, Bang Bang, It's Reeves And Mortimer, Monkey Trousers), quiz shows (Shooting Stars, Families At War) and dramas (Catterick, Randall And Hopkirk). But dominating all of these was an irrepressible glee for mucking around with one another, a feature that's at the heart of Lucky Sexy Winners.</p> <p>\"What we wanted to do was a sketch show or studio show,\" says Jim, \"but everything has to have a competition element to it [these days]. So we've made that as small as possible. Really, it's Bob and me doing what we do.\"</p> <p>\"But for a moment you could believe you're watching a quiz. This show is very weird,\" adds Bob.</p> <p>The weirdest yet?</p> <p>\"No, but there's always references for people's comfort. So you've got your Worrall Thompsons, Miranda Harts, Michael Bubl\u00e9. It makes [people] feel comfortable if they're hearing questions about celebrities. And the sketches in this are not quality. You're not seeing a Mitchell And Webb sketch.\"</p> <p>A bit of biscuit flies out of Bob's gob. He wafts it out of the way.</p> <p>\"Sorry.\"</p> <p>\"What, did you fart?\" Jim turns from his wall-gaze, abruptly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394857479\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/17/1345198145199/Vic-Bob-and-friends-in-Lu-004.jpg\" alt=\"Vic, Bob and friends in Lucky Sexy Winners.\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vic, Bob and friends in Lucky Sexy Winners.

For example, instead of questioning whether a Jaffa Cake is a biscuit or a cake, they will ask, \"Macaulay Culkin is a child, but can you name an adult?\" with the correct answer \u2013 obviously \u2013 being Tom Petty. Undoubtedly, British culture would be a much drearier place had they never met.</p> <p>\"I don't think I'm capable of doing a proper job,\" Jim shrugs.</p> <p>\"I always wanted to be a hairdresser. Think I'd be pretty good at it,\" says Bob confidently.</p> <p>\"I think you'd have some pretty unique styles. I used to do that in the 80s. People would come round my house. Did you used to dig in?\"</p> <p>\"How do you mean, 'dig in'?\"</p> <p>\"You know, if you wanted to do a Rod Stewart you'd dig in.\" Pause. \"We could've had a hair salon.\"</p> <p>\"What would you have called it?

Just imagine the Christmas party with all of the trimmings!\" Jim beams, before they enjoy a moment of wheezy laughter, made sweeter by the bits of chocolate around Bob's mouth.</p> <p>With their prolific careers soaring from mainstream to cult and back again, there must have been points where being funny or creative has just not been on the agenda?</p> <p>\"No, never,\" says Jim. \"We have some days where we write less but I create all the time, and sometimes you just get bored. When you get bored, it's going to show, so you always have to keep moving on.\"</p> <p>How do they sustain these levels of silliness, then, when the world endeavours to bring you down?</p> <p>\"Just move sideways,\" Jim says, smiling.</p> <p><em>Vic &amp; Bob's Lucky Sexy Winners is on Thursday, 9pm, Channel 4 </em></p>",
  "<h2>Reading/Leeds Festival</h2> <p>It's more than 20 years now since the Reading/Leeds festival entered its modern era, but the event's image remains the same: a goth eating a baked potato sitting by a fire made of plastic cups. A hard rock festival with occasional indie interloping, in recent years rock has steadily returned to the fore. This year that means goth-rock (the Cure), dance-rock (Kasabian and good old no-frills rock (Foo Fighters).

But Krantz is also an unflinching adventurer who dislikes repeating himself, and his trio shows (with bassist Tim Lefebvre and drummer Nate Wood) turn into bone-crunching three-way conversations. These match the impact of a heavy rock power trio to the melodic slipperiness of a contemporary jazz group.

She rose to prominence by adding thick, sultry vocals to clubby dubstep tracks, and claims to prefer the camaraderie of the nightclub crowd to the lonely exposure of the stage. Yet now she's here, she says she wants to be a \"private pop star, like Sade or Annie Lennox\". She's a compelling performer, with the ability to switch between post-Adele belters, atmospheric neo-soul and classy, electronic pop with consummate ease.</p> <p>In person, she's warm, garrulous and funny, constantly undercutting her every achievement with wicked, self-deprecating humour. Jessie attended a liberal-artsy private school, but on meeting her there's no hint of entitlement. Her feeling that she's somehow \"snuck through\" into the music world, like a fan who's managed to blag their way into the VIP compound, comes across as sincere.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394857995\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/15/1345041598716/Jessie-Ware-PR-004.jpg\" alt=\"Jessie Ware PR\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jessie Ware</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Becoming a pop star certainly wasn't on the agenda when Jessie graduated in English Literature from Sussex University five years ago. The daughter of former Panorama reporter John Ware, she once harboured dreams of following in her father's footsteps and taking a postgrad journalism training course \u2013 incorporating work experience on the Mirror's sports desk \u2013 before ending up at the Jewish Chronicle. \"I had to find Jewishy things to do for the listings pages, like if Matisyahu was in town,\" she recounts with a grin. \"I thought it might be a good way in, although to be honest, journalism felt more intimidating and competitive than singing does. I'm very nosy, but I wasn't very good at writing.\"</p> <p>Everyone knows that music journalists are failed musicians, so it's some consolation to encounter a pop singer who's a failed journalist. However, Jessie's life took a sharp left turn when her old schoolfriend Jack Pe\u00f1ate phoned her out of the blue to ask if she'd do backing vocals for him on a BBC session. After a couple of tours with Pe\u00f1ate and indie-rap duo Man Like Me, Jessie was introduced to Jack's XL labelmate Aaron Jerome, aka SBTRKT, who asked her to collaborate on a track called Nervous, the title accurately reflecting Jessie's trepidation about the whole affair. \"It was my first session and I was terrified. The track was so apt.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, her ability to ride SBTRKT's skittering beats earned Jessie a solo deal. And that's when the real panic set in. She describes a series of awkward encounters with label-endorsed songwriters that ended up \"like therapy sessions\".</p> <p>\"I didn't think anyone would give a shit about what I had to say because everyone had probably said it before, and more eloquently. I'd been getting on OK with this one guy, bonding over our love for Sade and Soul II Soul, and finally he was like, 'Right, well shall we just go the piano and jam?' And I went into the other room and burst into tears.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394857996\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/15/1345041351116/Dave-Okumu-of-The-Invisib-004.jpg\" alt=\"Dave Okumu of The Invisible\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dave Okumu of The Invisible.

He just gave me a big hug and told me, 'Songwriting's like shitting \u2013 you've just got to let it all out'.\"</p> <p>Dave's liquid guitars provide a shimmering backdrop for Jessie's vocals throughout the record, creating a very modern, British, anxious take on soul music. For the clubbier numbers, Jessie approached Bristol house prodigy Matt Walker AKA Julio Bashmore \u2013 although once again, the first session was awkward.</p> <p>\"Writing a pop song was a new thing for both of us, and I started to feel really self-conscious and out of my depth.\" To break the tension, the pair started flicking through a hip-hop magazine, alighting on a striking image of heavyweight rapper Big Pun in a yellow PVC suit, sitting on a throne. \"I decided, 'Right, I'm going to write a song about a girl trying to get him off his throne and dance'.\" Her gorgeously restrained summer smash 110% was the result, and Jessie was thrilled when Big Pun's estate gave them permission to use a sample of the late rapper reciting the line \"carving my initials on your forehead\" throughout the track.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eblGD5yuid8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eblGD5yuid8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eblGD5yuid8&amp;feature=plcp\">Reading this on mobile?

He wanted to bring out the Alicia Keys in me.\"</p> <p>Jessie reckons that the proudest moment of her career was hearing current single Wildest Moments \u2013 one of those Alicia Keys efforts \u2013 accompanying a montage of highlights from Andy Murray's dramatic third-round win at Wimbledon. She's not afraid to admit that that the country's need for a stirring anthem during Britain's Summer Of Sport\u2122 has been on her mind. \"Why do you think I wrote a song called <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvlFWmvgeVI\">Running</a> in Olympic year?\" she cackles.</p> <p>Yet anyone delving for turmoil and trauma behind the lyrics may be disappointed. \"I'm not a complicated person,\" shrugs Jessie. \"I feel what I sing, and I hope that's enough. I'm not going to become an alcoholic just for the cause of the music.\" She scans nervously around the room for any lurking record company spies. \"I don't know if I should say this, but I feel more like a singer than an artist.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394857997\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/15/1345041200908/Jessie-Ware-at-The-Nave-L-004.jpg\" alt=\"Jessie Ware at The Nave, London\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jessie Ware live at The Nave, London.

In any case, her performances in the videos to Running and 110% prove that there's a haughty diva in there somewhere.</p> <p>\"Yeah, I don't know what happens! I even shocked myself in the Running video when I started vogueing. It's meant to look fierce. I've had people basically say to me, 'Oh, you're not like you are in your videos \u2013 I thought you'd be more of a bitch!'\"</p> <p>Even if Jessie is ambivalent about the trappings of pop stardom, she figures that she may as well give it the full Cleopatra when the opportunity arises. \"The way I think about those videos is that I may not get a chance to do another one, so I want to look really good. That way, when I'm fat and gross and working at my local school, I can look back and say, 'Scrubbed up well, Jess'.\"</p> <p><em>Devotion is out on Monday on PMR Records</em></p> <h2><strong>Jessie's production pals</strong></h2> <p><strong>Dave Okumu, The Invisible</strong></p> <p>Okumu produced the bulk of Devotion for Ware, bringing his Grace Jones and Bob Marley records to adorn the studio and provide inspiration while they worked.

  "<p>During her tenure as warden of San Quentin prison, Jeanne Woodford presided over the executions of four prisoners. Now, as <a href=\"http://www.deathpenalty.org/section.php?id=10\">executive director of Death Penalty Focus, Woodford</a> is leading the charge to pass a <a href=\"http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/new-voices-former-california-justice-now-says-death-penalty-broken-beyond-repair\">resolution known as Proposition 34</a>, which would eliminate the ultimate punishment in the state of California. Woodford was never a death penalty enthusiast, but after witnessing her fourth execution, in 2002, she decided enough was enough. After each condemned man finally drew his last breath, she said, someone in the room who had witnessed the grim proceedings would inevitably ask the same question.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Is the world safer because of what we did tonight? We all knew the answer was no.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Voters in California will get to have their say on Proposition 34 this coming November and if it is passed into law, it would make <a href=\"http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/FactSheet.pdf\">California the 18th state to turn its back on the death penalty (pdf)</a>. It would also be a significant victory for all those opposed to the concept of \"an eye for an eye\" justice. California has more prisoners on death row than any other state in the nation (over 714) and spends more on the trials and appeals that keep them there ($184m per year) than is comfortable for a state struggling to pay for essential services.</p> <p>Yet, the proposal is being met with vehement opposition from death penalty advocates, <a href=\"http://www.sacda.org/assets/pdf/pr/advisories/Death%20Penalty.pdf\">including the office of the district attorney in Sacramento (pdf)</a>, on the grounds that some criminals have simply forfeited their right to live and that the families of their victims deserve closure. They believe that reforming the system by expediting the trial process and limiting the number of appeals is the better way forward.</p> <p>Speeding up the trial process would, indeed, save money, but there is a pretty solid reason why trials take more time and effort when a death penalty is sought rather than life without parole. No one wants to see an innocent person put to death for a crime they did not commit. <a href=\"http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/innocence-and-death-penalty\">Several people have been executed despite serious misgivings about their culpability</a>, and 140 people have been released from death row on evidence of their innocence. In California alone, six people on death row have been exonerated since 1976. If we truly believe that our court system should actually be about dispensing justice, then speeding up the process just to save money is not the way to go.</p> <p>As to the other arguments, Woodford points out that life without the possibility of parole is a pretty stiff sentence by any measure. If the proposition passes, former death row inmates would be required to work in prison and some of their earnings would go toward victim restitution, a far better way of saving money than creating the opportunity for 20 years' worth of appeals. As regards families of victims, they do, of course, deserve closure and some may want that restitution in the form of an execution. But more often than not, by the time a death sentence is actually carried out, the circus of appeals, counter appeals, stays of execution and the inevitable drama that surrounds the event itself, do little to provide closure and much to make the perpetrator look like the victim.</p> <p>This is pretty much how things played out with the fourth and final execution Woodford oversaw in 2002. The condemned man, Stephen Wayne Anderson, had been on death row for over 20 years before he had exhausted all his appeals. By then, he had reportedly become a reformed character in prison and was an award-winning poet. His appeals rested on the fact that the details of horrific abuse in his childhood, which would have impacted his sentencing, did not come to light during his trial. Surviving family members of his 81-year-old victim, Elizabeth Lyman, whom he shot dead in her home, reportedly said they did not want or need his execution. But the execution went ahead anyway, and <a href=\"http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/anderson754.htm/\">it was no subdued affair</a>.</p> <p>Over 200 death penalty opponents braved the freezing temperatures to hold a candlelit vigil outside the prison as the lethal three-drug cocktail that would take 12 minutes to kill Anderson was injected into his veins. He waived the opportunity to give a final statement but mouthed the words \"thank you\" to his public defender, who said \"I love you\" three times before he slipped into unconsciousness and finally died. You can see why, after such an ordeal that benefited nobody, Woodford and other witnesses would come to the conclusion that the world was not safer because millions of dollars of public money and thousands of hours of attorneys' time were expended to ensure that one prisoner was put to death.</p> <p>Heart-wrenching as Anderson's final hours were, they are fairly typical of what we've come to expect when a death row prisoner is finally executed. It is rare, in recent times, that a prisoner is put to death without some degree of public opposition. That often renders the prisoner a type of martyr, which must do little to console murder victims' families.</p> <p>Still, the death penalty as an option is not going to be eliminated quietly in California, despite the fact that the extremely costly and controversial punishment currently exists in name only. (Since 2006, there has been a moratorium on executions because of challenges to the legality of the three-drug method.) In the past, Californians have overwhelmingly supported the death penalty. <a href=\"http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/public-opinion-new-poll-shows-california-voters-support-life-without-parole-over-death-penalty\">Recent polls suggest</a>, however, that its popularity is waning and the public is starting to favor a sentence of life without parole \u2013 for moral reasons as much as economic ones.</p>",
  "<p>\"Miracle\" was Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's choice of word to define what Arsenal experienced last season. In order to end up with automatic qualification for the Champions League, when in the campaign's shocking opening phase they looked likelier candidates for relegation, Wenger deeply appreciates the qualities his team summoned. He does not mind admitting the fundamental part played by the captain Robin van Persie who is now a former player, even though that begs the question about whether they can work enough wonders in his absence.</p> <p>\"It is a miracle we finished third,\" Wenger said. \"A big part of the miracle is down to him and you have to give him credit for that. You have to respect what he did last year. Robin was captain of the team and until the last minute of the whole season he fought like mad. What he has done when he was here, every night you could call him and he was at home, prepared properly for the game. When he played he was 100% committed. Then he comes in after and wants to go. At the end he chose to go somewhere else. I don't like it. But this is the completely brutal reality of professional sport.\"</p> <p>Wenger is a forgiving type. No matter how often he must let go of a diamond that he has patiently polished, no matter how painful it might be on a personal level to see someone in whom he has invested countless hours strutting off with a rival, he never betrays the slightest hint of bitterness. Even a cursory glance around the internet demonstrates how easily the thin line between love and hate is crossed. But on the day that Van Persie sat beaming next to Sir Alex Ferguson pen at the ready, Wenger could not bring himself to be negative.</p> <p>That \"completely brutal reality\" of the modern game is not exactly something he is confronting for the first time. In 1998, when Wenger won the Premier League and FA Cup double in his first full season at Arsenal, nobody forced an unwelcome exit. Ian Wright, by then a bit-part player, said a teary farewell and moved towards semi-retirement at West Ham United for \u00a3750,000. Back then, the idea that a call from his old foe from Old Trafford might swing the transfer of Arsenal's most valuable asset would have been unthinkable. But Ferguson's chat was decisive here. \"In the end we did it, yes,\" Wenger admitted, a little bashfully.</p> <p>By the summer of 1999 the Nicolas Anelka saga changed everything. A bitterly contested \u00a323m transfer to Real Madrid was engineered, to Wenger's frustration, by the striker's brothers. Since then, the Arsenal summer transfer wrangle has become so ubiquitous you almost get the feeling Wenger just accepts it as a messy part of his job that has to be done.</p> <p>Nobody will ever convince him that criticising the club, when he feels they are just dealing with the real world of football in 2012, is anything other than deluded. \"We live in the economic reality which other clubs do not,\" he said. \"There are some things we cannot afford to do, it is as simple as that.\" Such as paying a salary of \u00a3200,000 per week? \"How much do you want to pay? \u00a3250,000? \u00a3300,000? Honestly, I think it is a short-term problem, that the world cannot go on like that.\"</p> <p>He would not say it but you could imagine Wenger thinking to himself: a hundred questions on a player who has left and the ramifications, and just one on Santi Cazorla, and none at all on Lukas Podolski or Olivier Giroud?</p> <p>Like most managers, looking out for tomorrow's challenges is far more meaningful than wallowing in yesterday's. Wenger is waking up to a new season and even though Van Persie has been gone only a couple of days, his focus is entirely on what he can coax out of his squad.</p> <p>A compressed and slightly chaotic pre-season has not been ideal, with many of the players enjoying extended breaks after the Euros, and their late arrival coincided with a whirlwind tour of Asia and a hastily cancelled trip to Nigeria. It means the big signings have had little match practice with their new team-mates outside of the training ground. \"Nice and relaxing,\" he quips. \"China, Malaysia \u2026\"</p> <p>Naturally Wenger is hopeful the newcomers are ready collectively to offset the departure of Van Persie and blend in nicely with the likes of Thomas Vermaelen and Mikel Arteta to give Arsenal a more experienced feel.</p> <p>But he cannot bring himself to let go of the ideal of developing young starlets and it was telling that the No10 shirt has been given to the precocious Jack Wilshere. \"We lose great players but I want to show that we have great players at the club. When everyone is fit we will see that. By giving Jack the No10 I want to show I am confident he will be the one who will lead the team one day.</p> <p>\"At his age, one year out is not easy to take and every day he comes in at 8 o'clock in the morning and works out but he didn't get anywhere. I want to show him that I believe in him and that he will come back quickly.\" He is due to return to squad training next month.</p> <p>The king may have abdicated but Wenger is already looking forward to the next coronation.</p>",
  "<p>Welcome to the \u00a39,000 tuition fee refugees. The number of British students applying to Dublin's <a href=\"http://www.tcd.ie/\" title=\"\">Trinity College</a> has jumped by 20% to nearly 2,000 this year. At <a href=\"http://www.ucd.ie/\" title=\"\">University College Dublin</a> (UCD), applications from students with British A-levels have surged 37% from 800 to around 1,100. The University of Groningen in the Netherlands, where many courses are taught entirely in English, has seen the number of applicants from Britain quadruple in the last two years alone.</p> <p>British 18-year-olds are fleeing the prospect of a \u00a350,000 bill for studying at home \u2013 and finding they can save as much as \u00a325,000 over three years by studying abroad as well as enjoying a life-changing experience.</p> <p>In Denmark, tuition fees for students from within the EU are zero. In the Netherlands, they are around \u20ac1,700 a year (\u00a31,330), and it's even possible to access Dutch state grants worth around \u20ac500 (\u00a3390) a month (see page 5). Irish institutions such as Trinity and UCD, ranked among the top universities in Europe, charge just \u20ac2,250 a year (\u00a31,760) to EU citizens.</p> <p>It has also emerged that a significant number of UK students have applied to universities in the EU as an \"insurance\" against failing to achieve the grades they want and having to go through clearing. Many British \"Russell group\" universities now demand A-level scores of AAB and above, while similarly-ranked Dutch universities accept lower grades \u2013 though they are much tougher (almost brutal, say some) about weeding out underperforming students in their first term.</p> <p>\"It's not exactly a flood of students fleeing the new tuition fees in Britain, but we are seeing much more interest,\" says Mark Huntington, who runs <a href=\"http://astarfuture.co.uk/\" title=\"\">astarfuture.co.uk</a>, which has since 2006 offered a free advisory service to British students and parents considering higher education opportunities abroad. There are now more than 1,200 degree courses in Europe (not including Ireland) taught entirely in English, while in the Netherlands alone 20 universities are teaching in English.</p> <p>\"The overall cost of a three-year course in Holland, taking in tuition fees, accommodation and living costs, will be around \u00a324,000 compared with the \u00a350,000 or so it now costs in the UK,\" says Huntington. But, as he warns on his website, \"we don't believe you should go abroad just to save money and there are lots of other reasons why studying abroad is a good idea.</p> <p>\"It is also worth bearing in mind that even though a degree abroad may be significantly cheaper than an equivalent qualification in the UK, you will possibly have to pay out more up front than if you were to study at home.\"</p> <p>Not being able to speak a word of Dutch, Danish or Flemish does not seem to be a problem. \"You could survive the whole way through a course in Holland without learning a word of Dutch,\" says Huntington. \"I wouldn't recommend it, but it is possible.\"</p> <p>Hania Thurlow, 18, from Norwich, left for <a href=\"http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/\" title=\"\">Maastricht University</a> yesterday a day after learning she had got A*AB in her A-levels. She initially planned to go to the University of Exeter, anticipating three A grades, but was deterred by the costs.</p> <p>\"The fees really put me off,\" she said. \"I know you can take out loans and don't have to repay them straight away, but it's still a huge debt. Accommodation costs are lower too. In Maastricht I will pay \u20ac375 (\u00a3293) rent a month for a room, but Exeter wanted \u00a3125 a week (\u00a3540/month). Even travel is cheaper \u2013 I can fly home from Eindhoven for around \u00a330 on Ryanair, less than the cost of going to Manchester.\"</p> <p>She is aware of the tougher first year students face in the Netherlands compared to Britain, but is unfazed: \"The first year is supposed to be quite difficult. But I'm going to university to study hard anyway.\" She has also already lined up part-time employment (arranged through the university) as a babysitter for Dutch families, and will be starting lessons in Dutch when she arrives. She says one other student from her school in Norwich is already at Maastricht, and another has applied.</p> <p>Christian Garrard from Canterbury, who is about to start his fourth year studying law at the <a href=\"http://www.rug.nl/corporate/index?lang=en/\" title=\"\">University of Groningen</a> says: \"It's the best decision I have ever made. I had a Dutch girlfriend and if it wasn't for her I would probably have thought, no way. It was only really daunting until I got here. As an international student you live in an international house, mostly with other foreign students who all speak English, while Groningen is almost becoming a bilingual university. I've thrived on it, though maybe if you're more of a home-bird it's not for you.\"</p> <p>Garrard worked part-time, which also enabled him to access Dutch grants, meaning that after two years he had no debts at all: \"I was even saving money at one point.\"</p> <p>But it is the Republic of Ireland which is seeing the biggest surge in British students beating the tuition fee hikes. For many 18-year-olds it is far less daunting than going to a non-English speaking country and many arrive with family connections in the country. The major barrier is academic entry requirements. \"The grade requirements can be almost ridiculously high,\" warns Huntington. The Irish equivalent of A-levels is the Leaving Cert, which covers six subjects. Unless a British student has studied four A-levels and gained good grades, they may find it difficult to obtain enough points to qualify for an Irish university.</p> <p>Prices in Dublin, once one of Europe's most expensive cities, is another issue, though the cost of living has fallen in recent years. UCD says rent for on-campus rooms are \u20ac486 a month (\u00a3380), while living off campus nearby in Rathmines would be about \u20ac450 (\u00a3352). The universities of Cork, Limerick and Galway all charge similar tuition fees but with lower living costs.</p> <p>Most of the \"bargain\" tuition fees are in EU countries, but some students are heading further afield. The University of Nottingham has set up campuses in<a href=\"http://www.nottingham.edu.my/index.aspx\" title=\"\"> Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/index.aspx\" title=\"\">Ningbo, China</a> (south of Shanghai), where students graduate with a UK degree. At \u00a37,100, fees at the Kuala Lumpur campus are not far short of the cost of studying at Nottingham, and most students are from Malaysia, but a number are now coming from Britain, many having gained scholarships. Without scholarships (and no access to student grants) the financial equation is much less attractive, though living costs are a fraction of the UK. In Ningbo, student accommodation is \u00a3100 <em>a year</em>. Nottingham was first to pioneer campuses abroad, and others are following: <a href=\"http://www.reading.ac.uk/malaysia/about/uorm-about.aspx\" title=\"\">Reading University</a> is opening a Malaysian campus in 2015 while <a href=\"http://www.liv.ac.uk/xjtlu/\" title=\"\">Liverpool</a> is partnering with a university in Shanghai.</p> <p>Emerging universities in Asia, keen to recruit European students, are also offering highly attractive scholarship programmes to students with decent A-level grades. Ben Poulter, 18, from Brentwood County High, a state school in Essex, will be packing his bags in a few weeks' time to head to Singapore, where he will begin a four-year course in business at <a href=\"http://www.spjain.org/\" title=\"\">SP Jain Global School of Management</a>. His second year will be in Dubai, followed by two years in Sydney, Australia. And the $18,000 annual tuition fees will be sliced to zero as it's entirely paid for by the scholarship.</p> <p>\"SP Jain came to our school and gave a presentation to year 12 and year 13 [lower and upper sixth],\" he says. \"I applied and they offered me a scholarship almost immediately after the interview so long as I got AAB at A-level. I'm really excited. It's a little bit daunting, but an incredible opportunity.\"</p> <p>Poulter was lucky; his school encouraged students to consider opportunities abroad. But Gerard Spencer, founder of <a href=\"http://www.europeducation.org.uk\" title=\"\">europeducation.org.uk</a>, which provides information on studying in Europe for students and parents, says: \"Unfortunately, most British schools don't talk about options outside the UK for higher education. Admissions to European universities for September 2012 are now closed. But postponing the decision for a year and starting in a European university in 2013 would be a unique and life-changing decision.\"</p> <h2>Reality restricts the overseas options</h2> <p>British students have a huge range of options for studying abroad, but the reality \u2013 if you want to keep costs low and can only speak English \u2013 is that Ireland and the Netherlands are head and shoulders above the rest. We've highlighted a few other choices \u2013 Denmark and Norway in particular, as they do not charge tuition fees. We excluded France and Germany because they have few courses taught in English (apart from a few specialist private universities). The US and Australia, with pricey tuition fees, only come into the picture because they offer numerous scholarships.</p> <h2><strong>Republic of Ireland</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395590193\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2012/8/17/1345205110023/Republic-of-Ireland-flag-001.jpg\" alt=\"Republic of Ireland flag\" width=\"220\" height=\"152\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Republic of Ireland flag Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Tuition fee</strong> \u20ac2,250 (\u00a31,760) student contribution for 2012/2013, expected to rise to \u20ac2,500 (\u00a31,955) next year. Students also pay \"capitation\" fees at institutions such as University College Dublin (\u20ac183/\u00a3143) to cover facilities such as its 50m pool. Private universities charge around \u20ac5,000 (\u00a33,900) a year.</p> <p><strong>What's available</strong> Seven universities, 14 institutes of technology and a number of private universities. Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin are ranked in the world's top 200 universities.</p> <p><strong>Entry requirements</strong> Tough. Based on points score in the Irish Leaving Certificate (six subjects, maximum 600 points for six As). A British A grade is worth 135 points, so students will need four good A-levels to obtain a place a leading university. Irish universities do not make conditional offers. No one receives an offer from an Irish university until they have received their grades.</p> <p><strong>Grants/Scholarships</strong> No Irish state grants for UK students. Individual universities have limited scholarships/exhibitions for top students.</p> <p><strong>Accommodation</strong> Not cheap. As an example, University College Dublin this year charges \u20ac486 (\u00a3380) per month.</p> <p><strong>Living costs </strong>High, especially in Dublin, where the price level is similar to London or higher. Part-time earning opportunities more limited than in the past; the Irish unemployment rate is 14.8% compared with 8.1% in the UK.</p> <h2><strong>Netherlands</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395590194\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2012/8/17/1345205132268/Netherlands-flag-001.jpg\" alt=\"Netherlands flag\" width=\"220\" height=\"151\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Netherlands flag Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Tuition fee</strong> \u20ac1,771 (\u00a31,385) for most courses. Expected to rise in line with inflation.</p> <p><strong>What's available</strong> Twenty universities offer degrees taught entirely in English, although at some (such as Amsterdam) there may be just one or two courses in English. Groningen and Maastricht are the most popular among British applicants. Groningen, founded in 1614 and one of the Netherlands' oldest universities, currently offers nine undergraduate programmes in English but will raise that to 19 in 2013.</p> <p><strong>Entry requirements</strong> A general rule is that a GCSE in three subjects with marks ranging from A*-C, plus a GCE (A-level) with three subjects at advanced level (six different subjects in total) is comparable to a Dutch VWO diploma and thus admissible for a programme in a Dutch university.</p> <p><strong>Grants/Scholarships</strong> British students can access Dutch student finance on exactly the same basis as local students. So long as you find part-time work of at least 32 hours a month and pay Dutch national insurance, you qualify for a grant of \u20ac266 (\u00a3208) a month, plus you can apply for a means-tested additional grant of up to \u20ac242 (\u00a3189) a month. Students can also borrow up to \u20ac285 (\u00a3223) a month if they have been awarded the full means-tested grant.</p> <p><strong>Accommodation</strong> Expensive in Amsterdam. Don't expect en-suite bathrooms. Rents outside the capital are typically \u20ac200-\u20ac400 (\u00a3150-\u00a3300) a month.</p> <p><strong>Living costs </strong>Approximately the same as London and the south-east of England, but higher than the north of England.

  "<p>It was jolly reassuring to learn from Ana Bot\u00edn, the UK chief executive of Santander, in her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/jul/06/santander-ana-botin-boost-uk-customers\" title=\"\">interview with the Guardian</a> recently, that her bank has turned the corner in customer service standards and is no longer the worst in Britain: because from where I sat \u2013 fuming \u2013 as an ordinary customer, you could have fooled me. No wonder the bank not only has a customer complaints department but, as I gradually learned, a separate escalated complaints department. And, if you reach that far and are persistent enough, an executive complaints team.</p> <p>They certainly need it. As one of them explained: \"We're all terribly busy here.\" I think I could hum the bank's jaunty holding jingle backwards because I heard it so often and if one more customer services person had said cheerily: \"No problem\", when I'd just outlined precisely what the problem was, I'd have screamed. Every time I rang, I got a different adviser. Every day they were going to call me back, but somehow they never did: so thank you Sharzia, Mohammad, Graham, Asher, Adam and several others: lots of no problems, no solutions.</p> <p>My wife and I became customers of the bank by default rather than choice when it took over Abbey National where we had our mortgage, but it wasn't really until this year that we fell into the toils of its bureaucracy. When I took voluntary redundancy after 22 years at the Guardian in March and received a large, but unfortunately one-off, payment into our current account we asked our branch if we could move it to a interest-bearing deposit account while withdrawing a sum each month for regular standing order payments.</p> <p>It seemed a simple enough request, as Santander regularly bombards customers with a bewildering array of special offers. So we blithely dropped into our branch to see a misnamed customer service adviser who sucked his young teeth and said ooh no, they didn't offer anything like that. He had the good grace to look apologetic but added no bank would do such a thing. There was no alternative: the money could either sit in our current account earning the bank interest and us none, or we could set up a savings account and dip into it once a year.</p> <p>We were somewhat peeved by this and walked out into the rain. Seeking shelter, we decided to try the next bank along the street, just to see whether they might offer us what we wanted. That bank was HSBC \u2013 yes, I know about the money laundering now, but we didn't then. Their adviser said of course they could. They were rather baffled that Santander wouldn't.</p> <p>So we took the plunge and decided to move banks. It's supposed to be straightforward, right? You sign the forms, they're forwarded to the other bank and the deed is done. Not if the bank is Santander, it's not. The forms were signed and sent by HSBC on 8 June but it took nine weeks, 62 days, to close the account. The forms were sent to Santander's closure department not once, not twice, not three times, but four \u2013 five if you count the top copy hand-delivered by our HSBC manager to our old branch down the road.</p> <p>I started by speaking twice to the local branch (\"Nothing to do with us. We can't help you. That's all done centrally\u2026\") then, as days turned to weeks, then months, to a succession of customer complaints people who all clucked and expressed sympathy before saying things like: \"moving forward\u2026\" and telling me that they hadn't a clue when the bank would get down to dealing with my request. \"Could take a week,\" one of them mused brightly, a month in.</p> <p>They took out a formal complaint on my behalf and wrote to me about it, twice \u2013 the second time to tell me that they had not quite got to the bottom of the matter but would let me know when they did. \"High-quality customer service is of great importance to us and we will do everything we can to resolve your complaint in a timely and satisfactory manner,\" wrote the business manager: complaints department, in a duplicated letter. One adviser told me that, if I really wanted to get my money, I could go into the branch, withdraw it all and then take it round to HSBC myself, for which privilege Santander would only charge me \u00a325. How long have you been dealing with this, she asked. I totted it up in my head: how long listening to the automatic options, the bland background music, the advisers telling me they hadn't a clue, the sorreees, the no problems, the we'll-get-someone-to-get-back-to-yous: three hours? Four?</p> <p>We actually had three Santander accounts: a current account, to receive my salary and for day-to-day spending, a second account into which we transferred a lump sum each month to pay our standing orders and a new account for my freelance business. HSBC sent all three transfer forms at the same time and one \u2013 for the standing orders account \u2013 was activated immediately: so the error must have been at Santander's end. They just didn't bother to do the rest.</p> <p>Several weeks in, the manageress of the local branch rang. She gathered I had a complaint and said she wanted to address it herself. \"I bet you didn't expect the branch manager to ring you,\" she added chirpily. \"It's all part of our commitment to customer service.\" Then she said she don't know why we were told Santander didn't offer a deposit account allowing regular withdrawals, because they do. I don't suppose I can tempt you back? she enquired hopefully.</p> <p>Seven weeks in and two letters arrived, written 10 and 11 days previously, from a business manager in Bradford and a manager of business banking in Bootle. They said we had to supply identification to close our accounts. If they didn't get it within 30 days they'd keep our accounts. By then, it had only taken 49 days to let us know this. No one had bothered to mention it before. No one in customer services seemed to have known, nor anyone in our branch. Nor had anyone written from the closures department before to advise us it was necessary. Nor did they require ID in order to terminate the account they had managed to close. If photocopies of our driving licences were all that was needed, you'd have thought that someone might just have mentioned it. It would have saved us all hours of wasted time.</p> <p>At last, after asking Santander's press office to respond to my problems with a comment for this article, the bank's executive complaints department promised the accounts would be closed and the money transferred. Two days later, they called again. My business account was closed and the money transferred. Only one small problem: they'd sent it twice, so could they have their money back please?</p> <p>Then, brrring, brrring: it's Jyoti from the executive complaints team again. Could we send a copy of our latest HSBC bank statement please? Why? What is my new account to do with them? Oh well, they will accept yet another copy of the HSBC transfer request as proof the account exists \u2013 as if I'd have wasted all this time for a joke.</p> <p>Half an hour later, another call. \"Hello. It's Jyoti again. Did HSBC offer you an inducement to change accounts?\" No, I said, they did not need to. No inducement was ever necessary to get us out of Santander.</p> <p>In the end, Santander gave me \u00a3204 for lost interest and \u00a3200 compensation to cover the aggravation \u2013 though I had to ask for it.</p> <h2>Santander says \u2026</h2>",

  "<p>For as long as I can recall, I've been unreasonably fascinated by other people's daily schedules. It thrills me to learn, for instance, that <a href=\"http://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/fashion-articles/24-hours-with-karl-lagerfeld-0412#slide-1\" title=\"\">Karl Lagerfeld</a> always sleeps for exactly seven hours, no matter when he goes to bed; that he drinks only Diet Coke, and rarely exercises \"because my doctor said it's not necessary\". My bursting mental library of similar trivia includes, naturally, <a href=\"http://dailyroutines.typepad.com/daily_routines/2009/02/winston-churchill.html\" title=\"\">Churchill's daily 90-minute siesta</a>, but also the fact that <a href=\"http://www.letsrun.com/forum/flat_read.php?thread=1120374\" title=\"\">Paula Radcliffe</a> is usually in bed by 10ish and that <a href=\"http://dailyroutines.typepad.com/daily_routines/2009/01/will-self.html\" title=\"\">Will Self</a> keeps a stove on his desk to brew \"strange infusions\" of tea while he writes. These days, I&#xa0;encounter such nuggets most frequently in media profiles of web entrepreneurs, presumably because they're our era's most envied role models. Thus I've discovered that Twitter co-founder <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2011/11/13/technology/dorsey_techonomy/index.htm\" title=\"\">Jack Dorsey</a> divides his week thematically: Tuesdays for product development, Wednesdays for marketing, etc. <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/media/2011/12/maria-popova-interview\" title=\"\">Maria Popova</a>, who runs the popular Brainpicker account on Twitter, gets so much reading done by taking her Kindle to the gym. And Facebook's chief operating officer, <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/facebook-sheryl-sandberg-can-leave-early-why-arent-you.html\" title=\"\">Sheryl Sandberg</a>, leaves the office at 5.30pm daily, for dinner with her children at 6pm. At any hour of the day, I can tell you what four or five famous people are probably doing, should you wish to know. Which, I&#xa0;appreciate, you maybe don't.</p> <p>I could claim high-flown motivations for this, and they'd be partly true: to grasp the finer textures of another person's life is surely the best way really to understand others. Mainly, though, I just want tips. I&#xa0;want to steal the bits of Dorsey's routines that lead to Dorseyesque success. So I was never going to be able to resist reading Laura Vanderkam's new short ebook, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Successful-People-Breakfast-Mornings%E2%80%93-ebook/dp/B007K3E2YK\" title=\"\">What The Most Successful People Do Before Breakfast</a>. How you use the early morning, she argues, defines the rest of your day; you can seize control before momentum sweeps you away. The Rev Al Sharpton, we discover, hits the gym at 6am; others have replaced family dinners with family breakfasts. \"If it has to happen,\" she writes, \"it has to happen first.\"</p> <p>Yet lurking behind my fixation, as you've probably realised, is a bright red sore thumb of a logical fallacy. There's simply no good reason to assume that adopting a morning ritual like the former CEO of Pepsi \u2013 a four-mile run at 5am \u2013 will make your own corporate titanhood more likely. Though we can't know, it makes far more sense to conclude that the kind of person destined, whether by genes or upbringing, to become a corporate titan will also be the sort prone to leaping into their trainers before sunrise. And that's before even considering whether&#xa0;corporate titans are happy.</p> <p>But this doesn't cure my fascination, I'm afraid. The best defence I can offer is that poring over others' schedules makes me, in a fruitful way, more conscious of my own; experimenting with the tricks I learn is fun, and making daily tasks a little more entertaining surely isn't a crime. One trick I've borrowed is that of ringfencing time. Dorsey's themed days and Sandberg's leaving times both rely on a kind of reverse <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law\" title=\"\">Parkinson's law</a>: rather than trying to fit everything in, decide on the hours in which certain work will be completed and, surprisingly often, you'll find that it is. (We don't all have their limitless freedom to set our work schedules, of course \u2013 but many of us have some.) Next, I'm going to start drinking 10 Diet Cokes a day, to see if I become an eccentric fashion designer.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"mailto:\" title=\"\">oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com</a></p> <p>Follow Oliver on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oliverburkeman\" title=\"\">Twitter</a></p>",
  "<p>Many of us walk through our front garden every day, in all seasons, and yet, apart from perhaps jazzing up the front door with some marguerites in pots (replaced by cyclamens in winter), we often don't make the most of this precious bit of green space. It's surprisingly easy to let it become a place where bins and car or bikes stand in full view, where junk lies around waiting to be taken to the dump, and where you haven't yet got round to doing something about the dusty shrubs inherited when you bought the house.</p> <p>Here are three good reasons to give the front some tlc. First, by the addition of some thoughtful planting and screening, you \u2013 and your visitors \u2013 will have the pleasure of a verdant journey, with a background of buzzing insects or calling birds, to the front door. Second, <a href=\"http://www.the-hta.org.uk/firstimpressions\" title=\"\">a well-tended front can add value to your property and maybe even clinch a sale</a> and encourage your neighbours to green up theirs, too. And, third, you can make a&#xa0;significant improvement to the local environment and especially the issue of flooding by rethinking the amount and type of paving you have, and by introducing a generous covering of plants.</p> <p>A recent survey for the <a href=\"http://www.rhs.org.uk/Gardening/Sustainable-gardening/Urban-greening\" title=\"\">RHS</a> showed that although those surveyed were generally environmentally aware (more than half had compost bins, wildlife areas and water butts), only one in 10 realised that planted gardens can help prevent flooding, and one in five had 75% or more of their front garden paved over. A&#xa0;survey on parking, published last month by the <a href=\"http://www.racfoundation.org/media-centre/spaced-out-press-release\" title=\"\">RAC</a>, found that 7m front gardens are concreted over (car ownership has risen from 2m to 28.5m since 1950). Paving can increase the amount of rainwater that runs off by as much as 50%, overloading storm drains and causing floods; soil and plants, on the other hand, slow down the runoff, eventually returning the water to the water table. Plants, especially trees, help to cool the atmosphere and filter polluted air. They also provide places for wildlife to feed and live.</p> <p>Since 2009, any front garden bigger than 5 sq m has to have planning permission to be paved. But even if your garden's smaller, it's important to think minimal hard landscaping \u2013 a path to the front door, somewhere to park the car \u2013 and to make sure it's permeable. The simplest and cheapest surface is gravel but there's a whole range of products, from brick pavers with in-built spacers to matrix pavers that contain an aggregate such as resin-bonded gravel (for advice and options see <a href=\"http://pavingexpert.com/\" title=\"\">pavingexpert.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/wps/portal/portalhome/unauthenticatedhome/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gjtxBnJydDRwMLbzdLA09nSw_zsKBAIwN3U_1wkA6zeHMXS4gKd29TRwNPI0s3b2e_AGMDAwOIvAEO4Gig7-eRn5uqX5CdneboqKgIAGUwqho!/dl3/d3/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/\" title=\"\">planningportal.gov.uk</a>). To avoid the car park look, designer Charlotte Rowe suggests breaking up surfaces such as resin-bonded gravel with lines of setts interplanted with low plants such as thyme. \"I use a pale shade, which gives a softer look, rather than the orangey shade you often see.\" Kent-based designer and lecturer Peter Bonney has used sleepers for the wheel tracks, with planted shingle, Derek Jarman-style, in between.</p> <p>Fronts throw up some particular challenges. Here are some tips:</p> <p><strong>Soil</strong> Often compacted, dry and dusty. Add plenty of organic matter before you start (50-litre bags of <a href=\"http://www.diy.com/nav/garden/garden-care-watering/growing/composts___fertilisers/-specificproducttype-fertilisers/Verve-Soil-Conditioner-50L-11907568\" title=\"\">B&amp;Q organic soil improver</a>, \u00a35.98; 900-litre load, from \u00a355, from <a href=\"http://www.compostdirect.com/\" title=\"\">compostdirect.com</a>).</p> <p><strong>Shade</strong> If the front is shady, stick to plants that thrive in shade and offer an interesting mix of foliage shapes and shades, such as camellias, box, hart's tongue ferns, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/plants/plant_finder/plant_pages/11268.shtml\" title=\"\"><em>Brunnera</em> 'Jack Frost'</a>, epimediums and sarcococca (for more suggestions, see the <a href=\"http://rhs.org.uk\" title=\"\">RHS plant selector</a>), and don't bother with grass.</p> <p><strong>Clutter</strong> Screen the bins and bikes, either with off-the-peg willow or wooden screens or boxes, or slimline sheds (<a href=\"http://frontyardcompany.co.uk/\" title=\"\">frontyardcompany.co.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.totalgardens.co.uk/\" title=\"\">totalgardens.co.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://greenfingers.com/\" title=\"\">greenfingers.com</a>). Alternatively make your own wooden shelter and top it with a living roof (for living roof ideas see <a href=\"http://livingroofs.org/\" title=\"\">livingroofs.org</a>). Paint the wood a neutral colour or a shade that matches the front door.</p> <p><strong>No soil</strong> In tiny urban fronts that are concreted over, it's still possible to plant up the space by using pots. Use the biggest ones you can afford \u2013 the heavier they are, the more difficult they are to steal \u2013 which will provide better growing conditions and allow you to include one or two showy plants in your display. Plant some climbers too, including edibles such as beans and climbing nasturtiums. If you have room for window boxes, choose the largest ones you can fit.</p> <p><strong>Focal point</strong> In a small front garden, it's more peaceful to have one focal point, which could be water, a&#xa0;piece of furniture or simply a large, shapely terracotta pot (unplanted). Framing the front door with a&#xa0;pair of&#xa0;pots containing a clipped evergreen (such as bay, box or the underused honeysuckle <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/plants/plant_finder/plant_pages/501.shtml\" title=\"\">Lonicera nitida</a>) sharpens up the entrance to the house. Feed in summer, and keep free of weeds.</p> <p><strong>Trees </strong>These<strong> </strong>will give scale, screening and a habitat for a variety of wildlife. In a small garden you may have room for only one. Choose&#xa0;a variety that will give interest during at least two seasons \u2013 crab apples and <a href=\"http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=116\" title=\"\"><em>Amelanchier lamarckii</em></a> both work well \u2013 and for fronts of every size check out a&#xa0;tree's eventual height and width before planting. Don't site trees where they might block light from ground-floor rooms.</p> <p><strong>All-year interest</strong> Include evergreens and clipped plants for structure through the winter months. Put in scented plants such as winter-flowering sarcococca and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/plants/plant_finder/plant_pages/257.shtml\" title=\"\"><em>Daphne odora</em></a> close to the path, which you will appreciate every time you pass.

  "<p>I adore recipes that make use&#xa0;of one cut of meat or a whole animal to create a&#xa0;complex dish, loaded with flavour. In many cases,&#xa0;that's achieved by cleverly using the braising stock to cook a&#xa0;grain and then serving everything \u2013 meat, starch and a few quick and easy to make (or buy) condiments \u2013 in perfect harmony. I recently came across some traditional Palestinian dishes, such as mansaf or kidreh, that do just that with lamb, rice and&#xa0;saffron.</p> <p>Hainanese chicken rice is a Malaysian/Singaporean classic that I have been admiring for years, not only for its thrift and crafty cooking technique, but also for the way in which just a few subtle and simple flavours \u2013 namely ginger and spring onion \u2013 create so immense and compelling an impact. And that is even before you douse everything with those intensely delicious chilli and soy condiments. Make it once and it is likely to turn into a habit.</p> <h2>Hainanese chicken rice</h2> <p>For the chilli sauce, try to find relatively mild chillies, or just use fewer of them. Failing that, you can&#xa0;also use a ready-made sauce \u2013 I&#xa0;like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sriracha_sauce_(Huy_Fong_Foods)\" title=\"\">the Sriracha brand</a>; just make&#xa0;sure it's a savoury variety, not a sweet one. The acar recipe that follows is another condiment that you can quite happily serve alongside the chicken. Serves four.</p> <p><strong>100g ginger, peeled and thinly sliced (net weight), plus an extra 15g,&#xa0;finely chopped, for the rice</strong><br><strong>100g spring onion, sliced into 2cm pieces, plus 1 more whole spring onion for garnish</strong><br><strong>1 free-range chicken weighing about&#xa0;1.5kg</strong><br><strong>1 large cucumber, peeled</strong><br><strong>75ml dark soy sauce</strong><br><strong>25ml light soy sauce</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp toasted sesame oil</strong><br><strong>35g unsalted butter</strong><br><strong>3 cloves garlic, peeled and finely&#xa0;chopped</strong><br><strong>420g jasmine rice</strong><br><strong>Salt</strong><br><strong>3 tbsp shop-bought fried shallots (optional)</strong><br><strong>10g picked coriander leaves</strong></p> <p>For the chilli sauce<br><strong>About 10 mild to medium-heat red chillies, deseeded and roughly chopped (80g net weight)</strong><br><strong>20g ginger, peeled and roughly chopped</strong><br><strong>4 cloves garlic, peeled and roughly&#xa0;chopped</strong><br><strong>2 tsp caster sugar</strong><br><strong>2 tbsp groundnut oil</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp lime juice</strong><br><strong>\u00bd tsp fish sauce</strong></p> <p><em>For the chicken and the broth</em><br>Fill a large pot with cold water and add the sliced ginger and spring onion. Bring to a boil and put in the chicken (for extra flavour, stuff the chicken with more crushed fresh ginger and whole spring onions, if you like). Make sure the chicken is completely submerged in the water. Put a lid on the pot and bring back to a rapid boil. Simmer for 10 minutes, then remove the pot from the heat and leave to one side, covered, for 50-60 minutes.</p> <p>Once the time's up, check the bird is cooked by inserting a small, sharp knife into the thickest part of the thigh by the bone \u2013 the juices should run clear. Lift the chicken from the stock and slice off each breast, skin included, in one piece. Put the breasts in a bowl with a little stock to keep them moist. Return the remaining chicken to the stock pot, bring back to a boil and simmer, uncovered, for five minutes more. Remove the pot from the heat and set aside to cool down a little.</p> <p><em>For the condiments</em><br>Make the condiments while the chicken is cooking. For the chilli sauce, put all the ingredients in a&#xa0;small food processor bowl, adding half a teaspoon of salt, and work for a couple of minutes until you have a uniform sauce. Top and tail the cucumber, cut it in two lengthways, then slice each half on an angle into 0.5cm-thick slices. Slice the whole spring onion on a sharp angle into long, thin slices and put these in a bowl in the fridge with some ice water. Whisk together the two soy sauces and the sesame oil.</p> <p><em>For the rice</em><br>Start preparing the rice about 30 minutes before serving. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan. Add the 15g of chopped ginger and the garlic, and saut\u00e9 on medium heat for three minutes, until light golden. Add the rice and a teaspoon of salt, and saut\u00e9, stirring, for four minutes; add a bit of stock if it starts sticking to the bottom of the pot.</p> <p>Take 750ml of the chicken stock, including any fat that has collected on the surface, and add to the rice pot. Bring to a rapid boil, cover with a tight lid, reduce the heat to the absolute minimum, leave to cook for 20 minutes, then remove from the heat but keep covered.</p> <p><em>To serve </em><br>When you are ready to serve, return the chicken breast to the hot stock to heat it up a little; it needs to be just warm. Meanwhile, chop the rest of the chicken \u2013 thighs, drumsticks and wings \u2013 into pieces of whatever size you prefer. Place these pieces on a large platter and top with the breasts, each cut neatly into three pieces widthways with the skin left on; you want to see the breast meat, not the messy, bony pieces of chicken underneath.</p> <p>Arrange a few cucumber slices alongside the chicken and place the rest on a small plate to serve separately. Spoon some of the soy and sesame sauce over the chicken and put the rest in a small bowl. Put the chilli sauce in a similar bowl. Put&#xa0;some rice in a medium-size, deep bowl and press down to mould it. Turn over briskly on to the platter&#xa0;and sprinkle with fried shallots, if using. Heat up the stock (reduce it a bit for extra flavour, if you like), season with salt to taste, sprinkle with coriander and ladle into individual bowls \u2013 the stock is eaten as a soup served at the same time as the chicken. Finally, drain and dry the spring onion slices from&#xa0;the fridge, sprinkle over the chicken and serve.</p> <h2>Penang acar</h2> <p>This Malaysian vegetable relish is best at room temperature as a condiment for rice, seafood, chicken or tofu. It will keep in the fridge for up to two weeks, during which time it will develop and improve. Serves eight.</p> <p><strong>1 large cucumber (about 450g)</strong><br><strong>Salt</strong><br><strong>240ml white-wine vinegar</strong><br><strong>2 large carrots (200g gross weight), peeled and cut into 1cm x 4cm strips</strong><br><strong>200g french beans, stem end trimmed</strong><br><strong>400g white cabbage (ie, around half&#xa0;a cabbage), leaves separated and cut into 2cm x 4cm strips</strong><br><strong>180ml sunflower oil</strong><br><strong>60g caster sugar</strong><br><strong>2 medium-heat red chillies, halved lengthways, seeds removed and cut into thin strips</strong><br><strong>70g toasted peanuts, roughly crushed</strong><br><strong>25g toasted sesame seeds</strong></p> <p>For the spice paste<br><strong>5 dried chillies of around 8cm long, rehydrated in warm water, drained and finely chopped</strong><br><strong>2 fresh red chillies, finely chopped</strong><br><strong>200g shallots, peeled and roughly&#xa0;chopped</strong><br><strong>8 garlic cloves</strong><br><strong>\u00bd tsp shrimp paste</strong><br><strong>1 tsp ground turmeric</strong><br><strong>15g fresh galangal or ginger, peeled and roughly chopped</strong></p> <p>Cut the cucumber in half lengthways, remove and discard the&#xa0;seeds, then cut into sticks of roughly 1cm wide x 4cm long. Put the cucumber sticks in a colander, sprinkle with half a teaspoon of salt, stir and leave for 30&#xa0;minutes to drain. Rinse under cold water, drain and dry.</p> <p>Fill a medium pot with plenty of water and 140ml of the vinegar, bring to a boil and then blanch each vegetable separately \u2013 the cucumber for 30 seconds, the carrots and beans for two minutes each, and the cabbage for one minute. Drain well, pat dry and lay out to dry in the sun for 40 minutes or in an oven preheated to 130C/260F/gas mark \u00bd for 20 minutes.</p> <p>Put all the ingredients for the spice paste in a small food processor bowl and work to a uniform paste, adding three tablespoons or so of the sunflower oil to make everything come together.</p> <p>Heat the remaining sunflower oil in a large, heavy saut\u00e9 pan or wok. Add the spice paste and cook, stirring, on medium heat for about 10 minutes, until it's dark red and the oils starts to separate. Carefully (it may spit!), add the remaining vinegar and the sugar, and cook, still&#xa0;stirring, for a minute.</p> <p>Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the cooked vegetables. Transfer to a bowl and leave to cool.

  "<p>The age of Elizabeth I, so often celebrated as a period of glorious national achievement, was one of intense insecurity. Beset by enemies at home and abroad, the Queen knew that her hold on the crown was always precarious. The Catholic powers of Europe regarded her as a heretic and a bastard. Pope Pius V tried to depose her. Philip II of Spain attempted armed invasion. The loyalty of English Catholics, unreconciled to her Protestant church settlement, was always in doubt.</p> <p>Elizabeth created further anxiety by persistently refusing to nominate her successor. The stability of the regime thus depended entirely on her own personal survival. As one MP put it in 1567: \"If God should take her Majestie, the succession being not established, I know not what shall become of myself, my wife, my children, lands, goods, friends or country.\"</p> <p>Feelings of anxiety and distrust were intensified by an unending series of conspiracies and assassination plots. The Rising of the Northern Earls in 1569, the Ridolfi Plot of 1569-71, the Throckmorton Plot of 1583 and the Babington Plot of 1585-6 were only the best publicised of repeated attempts to dethrone the Queen by insurrection, foreign invasion or simple assassination. There were three such plots in 1596 alone. Many of these conspiracies sought to replace Elizabeth with the Catholic Mary Stuart, the ex-Queen of the Scots who had taken refuge in England after her forced abdication in 1568, and whose strong hereditary claim to the succession was terminated only by her execution in 1587.</p> <p>Prominent among the conspirators were the English Catholic exiles who had fled to the continent after Elizabeth's succession. Young men were trained for the priesthood at newly created English seminaries in Douai and Rome under the supervision of their spiritual leader, William Allen, formerly Principal of St Mary Hall, Oxford. They were then sent to England as missionaries to bring the country back to Rome. Most English Catholics refused to allow their religion to shake their political allegiance to the Queen, and many of the seminary priests regarded their mission as purely pastoral. But Allen himself believed in the Papal deposing power, and was committed to a policy of military invasion. One English priest assured Philip of Spain in 1596 that \"if the entire destruction of England was for the greater glory of God\", he would be glad to see it done.</p> <p>Confronted by these threats, the Elizabethan government embarked on a draconian policy of counter-terrorism. The laws of treason were extended to catch not just those who questioned Elizabeth's right to rule, but all missionary priests and those who sheltered them. Torture was not permitted by the common law, but special powers were invoked to justify its regular use to extract information from Catholic suspects. The procedure in treason trials gave the accused no chance of offering an adequate defence, and unsafe convictions were common. The standard penalty for traitors was to be hanged, cut down when still alive, castrated, disembowelled and dismembered. Over 100 Catholic priests suffered this fate. This was not enough for Elizabeth, who wanted her Privy Councillors to devise an even more terrible death for the Babington conspirators, who had planned to murder her.</p> <p>But before plotters and missionary priests could undergo the rigours of the law, they had to be caught. To help them do this, government ministers created a network of spies, informers and agents provocateurs. These forerunners of MI5 were the \"watchers\", whose activities form the subject of Stephen Alford's absorbing and closely documented book. Alford is a professional historian, with an excellent command of the manuscript sources, and he tells an exciting story. Although he adds many new details, its outlines have been familiar since at least 1925, when the American historian Conyers Read made espionage a prominent theme in his three-volume biography of Sir Francis Walsingham, the Queen's Secretary of State and chief spymaster, who was the \"C\" of the Elizabethan intelligence service. Appropriately, Read was recruited during the second world war to work for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), precursor of the CIA.</p> <p>Alford does not claim to offer a comprehensive study of Elizabethan intelligence operations; he skates quickly over some episodes and makes no mention of such obvious figures as the notorious torturer and interrogator, Richard Topcliffe. But his accounts of the unmasking of the Throckmorton and Babington plots are full and gripping, and he throws much light on the secret agents who exposed these and similar conspiracies, and, in some cases, fomented them.</p> <p>Elizabethan spies were employed on an ad hoc basis and paid by results, a method which inevitably produced wildly exaggerated scare stories. Some agents were highly accomplished figures, such as Thomas Phelippes, a skilled linguist, mathematician and expert cryptographer. Some were captured Catholic priests who were \"turned\" and sent back to their masters as double agents, a technique often said to have been invented during the second world war by the Oxford don, JC Masterman. Several spies crop up in other contexts: the writer Anthony Munday, author of an eyewitness account of life at the English College in Rome, later collaborated with Shakespeare; and Robert Poley, who went on 26 missions for the Queen's \"special affairs\", was one of those present at the&#xa0;killing of Christopher Marlowe. Many agents were bankrupts who began and ended their careers in prison; having offered Walsingham their services as stool pigeons, they were despatched abroad, where they were frequently caught and sent back to spy for the enemy, only to be arrested again and returned. As with some modern intelligence agents, it was often unclear, even to themselves, where the&#xa0;loyalties of these chronic side-changers really lay.</p> <p>Alford vividly evokes this murky world of codes, ciphers, invisible ink, intercepted letters, aliases, disguises, forgeries and instructions to burn after reading. The Catholic plotter Gilbert Gifford was \"the most notable double treble villain that ever lived\", thought one contemporary; 400 years before John Le Carr\u00e9, Walsingham had him publicly denounced as a traitor in order to provide cover for his activities as a double agent. The most spectacular sting involved obtaining the evidence necessary to convict Mary Queen of Scots by persuading her to employ a supposedly secret method of corresponding with the French ambassador; Walsingham's spies obligingly carried her letters for her, in cylinders concealed in beer barrels, making copies en route, and even adding a forged postscript to one of them, inviting the recipient to divulge the names of his fellow-conspirators.</p> <p>Entrapment was common, but the technique could backfire. William Parry was a spy for Elizabeth's Treasurer Lord Burghley with a tendency to be too clever by half. After inveigling a Catholic gentleman into a plot to kill the Queen, he was himself accused and executed for his involvement in it.</p> <p>Inevitably, the evidence for many of these transactions is incomplete and ambiguous. Alford, however, does not allow many scholarly doubts to impede his flowing narrative or inhibit his crisp judgments on individuals and their motives. On the other hand, he is too fastidious to draw the modern analogies that will certainly occur to his readers. It is tempting to regard William Allen as a 16th-century Osama Bin Laden, and the English College at Rome as the equivalent of a terrorist training-camp in Pakistan. Young Catholic priests, blessed by the Pope, and knowingly heading for a terrible death, were the suicide bombers of their time, even though their only weapons were spiritual ones. Walsingham's counter-terrorists resemble their modern counterparts in their eagerness to bypass normal legal process by using torture. Unlike some of their successors, they seem to have drawn the line at targeted assassination, but if the Elizabethans had had telephones they would undoubtedly have tapped them.</p> <p>Like Elizabeth I's agents, today's security services keep suspects under surveillance, intercept their communications, infiltrate their training camps, bribe informers and make pre-emptive arrests. Whether they also forge messages, employ agents provocateurs and engage in entrapment, we do not know, but it would be surprising if they didn't. For the methods of espionage have been remarkably constant over the centuries. Stephen Alford's engrossing book reminds us that most governments will stop at very little if national security is at stake. When political conflicts are exacerbated by fanatically held religious differences, the outcome is even more deadly.</p> <p>Keith Thomas is the author of <em>The Ends of Life: Roads to Fulfilment in Early Modern England</em> (OUP).</p>",
  "<p><strong>Tubes: Behind the Scenes at the Internet</strong> by&#xa0;Andrew Blum (Viking, \u00a312.99)<br>In 2006, an American senator was widely ridiculed for saying that the internet was basically \"a series of tubes\". But he was right. This author had the nice idea to \"visit the internet\", or examine the tubes, so off he trots to see exchanges crammed with routers in London and Amsterdam, data centres in Oregon, and a Portuguese beach where new undersea cable to Africa is being laid. Cheerful engineers show him round \"cyberrific\" facilities filled with \"blinky lights\", and he demonstrates well that the internet tracks established lines of political geography, and that the \"cloud\" is physical and secretive.<br>The ratio here of traveloguey musing to technical elucidation, however, is cirrostratusly high. I ended up little the wiser about how fibre-optic cable works, while Blum devotes excruciating amounts of local colour to each trip: confirmation emails, hire cars, stop-offs at tourist attractions. Still, he is heroic, in a way, in expending so many words describing near-identical buildings. \"I had learned what the internet looked like, generally speaking: a self-storage warehouse.\"<br><strong>Stars: A Very Short Introduction </strong>by Andrew King (Oxford, \u00a37.99)<br>Technical elucidation, this book shows, can in the right hands be a lot more exciting than What I Did on My Research Trip. The astrophysicist author delights in his continuing scientific detective story, from the discovery that the sun is a ball of hot gas to the realisation that every atom in our own bodies must have come from inside a star. Some of the physics is pleasantly counterintuitive (\"Stars heat up when they try to cool\"), and the reader also learns about x-rays, quantum tunnelling and stellar recycling (which doesn't mean doing the right thing with your empty beer cans).<br>It's hard not to anthropomorphise stars, if not quite as the ancient Greeks did: they \"evolve\" and strain mightily to avoid \"degeneracy\" throughout their \"lives\". Cleverly, King takes us through the biographies of various sorts of star, revealing only at the end&#xa0;that we have just witnessed the creation of a white dwarf or black hole.&#xa0;\"So&#xa0;<em>that's</em> what a supernova is,\" I&#xa0;realised with satisfaction, even though I still didn't know much about fibre-optics.<br><strong>Wait: The Useful Art of Procrastination</strong> by Frank Partnoy (Profile, \u00a312.99)<br>\"Excellent,\" I thought when I picked this off the pile and scanned the blurb, \"a book about the virtues of procrastination. Must be time for lunch.\" When,&#xa0;days later, I got round to reading it at the last possible minute, I realised I was supposed to take even more time to evaluate it, since its message is that&#xa0;we tend to \"react too quickly\" in&#xa0;making decisions. Waiting a&#xa0;bit, writes the amiable law-and-finance-prof author, is usually a good idea: he discusses useful delays in the expert actions of fighter pilots, sportspeople and doctors; how comedians place a \"beat\"; why a \"snap apology\" can be a bad idea; and how a high-frequency stock-trading system (exploiting the mysteries of fibre-optic cable) got better results when forced to&#xa0;slow down.<br>Putting things off, then, can be \"smart\", despite the exhausting rhetoric of what Partnoy calls \"the do-it-now anti-procrastination industry\". It's a&#xa0;smoothly sceptical essay: partly contra-Gladwellian, but with the&#xa0;same comfy furniture of sports anecdotes and chirpy scientists. I instinctively approved of the basic message \u2013 \"Think&#xa0;more!\" \u2013 but I had run out of time to decide reliably whether it was a&#xa0;good idea.</p>",
  "<p><strong>A Killing in the Hills </strong>by Julia Keller (Headline, \u00a314.99)</p> <p>The first crime novel from Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Keller is set in Acker's Gap, West Virginia, in a \"shabby afterthought of a town tucked in the notch between two peaks of the Appalachian mountains\". The scenery is stunning, but the community is trapped in a hopeless cycle of poverty and drug abuse. At the start of the novel, three elderly men are gunned down at the local diner, witnessed by Carla, daughter of prosecuting attorney Bell Elkins. This novel may have run-of-the-mill ingredients \u2013 Attorney Elkins, the protagonist with a troubled past; rebellious Carla, who attempts her own investigation; a mysterious \"Mr Big\", who gets a young hoodlum to do his dirty work, and so on \u2013 but they are brilliantly presented. The quality of the writing lifts it far above standard fare.</p> <p><strong>Vengeance</strong> by Benjamin Black (Mantle, \u00a316.99)</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/22/john-banville-benjamin-black-author\" title=\"\">Benjamin Black is the <em>nom de crime</em></a> of the Booker prize-winning Irish author John Banville, and <em>Vengeance</em> is his fifth book to feature the Dublin-based pathologist Quirke. Like its predecessors, it's set in the 50s; Black has succeeded in creating a definitive Irish form of period noir, permanently overcast by clouds without, cigarette smoke within, a ubiquitous air of melancholy, and a supporting cast of lonely, available and preternaturally forgiving women. The book begins with the suicide at sea of prominent company director Victor Delahaye, witnessed only by the son of his partner Jack Clancy. Despite a long and successful association, the two families are at loggerheads, fighting over control of the business. The plot is fairly straightforward, and neither Quirke nor his policeman colleague Hackett do much detecting, but the characters keep one's interest, and the writing, as always, is lovely.</p> <p><strong>The Thief</strong> by Fuminori Nakamura, translated by Satoko Izumo and Stephen Coates (Corsair, \u00a39.99)</p> <p>The first novel by the celebrated Japanese author Nakamura to be translated into English, <em>The Thief</em> is a minimalist sliver of Tokyo noir. Told in the first person by an anonymous pickpocket, expert in targeting rich marks in the crowded city, it's the story of a man with few emotional connections. His only real engagement is with a young boy who, forced into stealing by his mother, is a would-be shoplifter's apprentice. His past catches up with him when an old acquaintance offers him a lot of apparently easy money to join a gang burgling a rich man's house. There's plenty of reflection about the meaning of life on the margins, theft as metaphor and the like. This isn't for those who prefer the conventional crime novel. It is, however, an intelligent, compelling and surprisingly moving tale, and highly recommended.</p> <p><strong>Safe House</strong> by Chris Ewan (Faber, \u00a312.99)</p> <p>To an outsider, the things that spring to mind in connection with the Isle of Man \u2013 motorcycles, flogging, Norman Wisdom and tailless cats \u2013 add up to an odd, probably outdated picture, but not an obvious location for a high-octane thriller. In <em>Safe House</em>, Ewan's first standalone book after a series of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/crime/9781847393593/the-good-thiefs-guide-to-paris\" title=\"\">comic crime novels</a>, blokey TT racer Rob Hale&#xa0;comes round after a bike accident to be told that Lena, the woman who was riding pillion when he crashed, is a figment of his imagination.

  "<p>The words \"terrorism\" and \"terrorists\" were coined in the wake of the French revolution to describe the \"men of blood\" who established and exercised the mechanisms of fearsome repression \u2013 the Revolutionary Tribunal, its Law of Suspects and the guillotine \u2013 designed to conquer tyranny and secure liberty in the name of the sovereign people. \"Liberty or Death\", the Jacobins proudly proclaimed, before their club was closed. \"Did you want a revolution without a revolution?\" Robespierre sharply remarked.</p> <p>In her provocative essay, Sophie Wahnich has new things to say about the difference between today's terrorists and their nominal 18th-century predecessors. She also offers a bold reconstruction of the emotions that drove the French revolutionaries to terror, reminding her readers that this particular period of history remains a political laboratory where it is possible to ask extreme questions about the causes and consequences of revolutionary violence. Her premise is that dismissive disgust at blood spilt and life lost is an edifying but overly simplistic and apolitical response to revolution past and present.</p> <p>On the putative connection between the French revolution and the terrorists of 9/11 Wahnich is clear: \"Revolutionary terror is not terrorism. To make a moral equivalence between the Revolution's year II and September 2001 is historical and philosophical nonsense.\" In her conclusion she reiterates the disjunction: \"The violence exercised on 11 September 2001 aimed neither at equality nor liberty. Nor did the preventive war announced by the president of the United States.\"</p> <p>According to Wahnich, there is an analogy to be drawn between 1793 and 2001, in the way the French revolutionaries and the Americans responded to \"being in fear\" by seeking common resistance to the enemy through anger, courage and justice. But here the analogy ends because, \"the Americans, despite what they say, do not live in a time of foundation, and we have not finished observing the forms of dread that the American response has provoked \u2013 the dread of a violence that is not foundational but policing, and recently also preventative.\"</p> <p>The French revolutionaries, in contrast, did live at a time of foundation (of new political values), represented by the universal \"Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen\", which, Wahnich argues, could not be secured without heroism in the face of profanation. On her account, the price of the Terror was \"a sacred transaction in which the foundation of values required the death of men, in which body and soul had to be committed, and anyone could perish from fear or be overcome by disgust. This in my view is the forgotten price of the Revolution, the buried price of the Terror \u2013 a price that is indissociably moral and political at once, and that lies in discomfort, risk and a gamble.\"</p> <p>Wahnich is especially good at describing the fracturing of the revolutionary movement over the question of clemency. On the one hand, Danton \u2013 \"Since when is man infallible and exempt from error?\" \u2013 who could ask pardon on the scaffold for his role in establishing the institutions of the Terror. On the other hand, Saint Just, who asked for no forgiveness but pointed to the copy of the Declaration of Rights on the wall of the room in which he was held the night before his execution and said: \"After all, I did that!\" As for Robespierre, there is no way of knowing whether he had regrets about the price of the Terror, or thought the gamble had paid off. In the end he could not speak because half his jaw was shot off (by his own hand or another) and when he gestured for a pen, no one would give him one. But such had been his commitment of body and soul to the revolution, for good or ill, that regret seems unlikely.</p> <p>Wahnich's essay contributes to and is informed by a reassertion of the left's historiographical grip on the revolution. In this story, the historian Fran\u00e7ois Furet is the arch enemy, for stridently declaring on the eve of the bicentenary in 1989: \"the French Revolution is over!\" Furet's heirs are derided for focusing attention on the liberal constitutional aspirations of 1789, instead of the dark days of the Terror, which surely played a part in the founding of our western democracies.</p> <p>An introduction by Slavoj \u017di\u017eek ill-serves this book. Gushingly and flamboyantly welcoming \u2013 \"we were not waiting merely for a book like this; this is the book we were waiting for\" \u2013 he opens with Zhou Enlai's well-worn quip that \"it is still too early to tell\" what the French revolution has achieved. Then comes an anticapitalist rant that makes passing reference to a number of contemporary films. It is only in the last paragraph of his introduction that \u017di\u017eek reminds himself to get \"back to Wahnich's book\". Finally, he issues some orders: \"\u2026 the reader should approach its topic \u2013 terror and terrorism \u2013 without ideological fears and taboos, as a crucial contribution not only to the history of the emancipatory movements but also as a reflection on our own predicament. Do not be afraid of its topic: the fear that prevents you from confronting it is the fear of freedom, of the price one has to pay for freedom.\"</p> <p>Being frightened of terror and terrorism and refusing to think carefully and accurately about the topic are not the same thing. Nor is being frightened of terror and terrorism necessarily connected to the fear of freedom, or the price one might be made to pay for freedom in specific political circumstances. Many of the participants in the French revolution thought long and hard about such questions, and while it is sometimes difficult to understand their thoughts, and not always comfortable to do so, it is always interesting to go back into that perennial political laboratory and try. Wahnich's provocative book is testament to that.</p> <p>Ruth Scurr is the author of <em>Fatal Purity: Robespierre and the French Revolution</em> (Vintage).</p>",
  "<p>One of the most common words used to&#xa0;describe a response to a novel is also&#xa0;one of the most untrustworthy: sympathy. When readers speak of sympathising with a character, they seem to be testifying to the credibility of a novel. Where a reader cannot sympathise, the novelist seems to have failed. Yet <em>Regeneration</em> deliberately makes us uncertain of our sympathies.</p> <p>Pat Barker shifts the point of view of&#xa0;her third-person narration throughout the novel. We are allowed to know the thoughts of several characters. Some of them are historical \u2013 William Rivers, the doctor treating shell-shock victims during the first world war; Siegfried Sassoon, the poet, who was one of his patients \u2013 and some invented: Billy Prior, another traumatised soldier, and Sarah Lumb, the munitions worker whom he is courting. The shifts of viewpoint seem calculated as&#xa0;much to undermine our sympathies as to invite them.</p> <p>Sassoon is not shell-shocked: his friend Robert Graves has used his influence to save Sassoon from punishment for his exhibition of anti-war sentiments. He has written a public declaration against the war, and while on leave has thrown the Military Cross he had been awarded into the River Mersey. The novel includes several of Sassoon's poems, which recoil from the horror and futility of the war and savage those&#xa0;who prosecute it. Yet he is not a&#xa0;convenient focus for any reader's anti-war feelings. He is determined to&#xa0;return to the front, and to have Rivers tell him that he is \"pleased\" at this decision.</p> <p>Sassoon may seem to Rivers to wish&#xa0;to be killed, but we know that he&#xa0;will survive the war; Wilfred Owen, another patient at Craiglockhart hospital in Edinburgh who befriends Sassoon, may be safely confined to the hospital at the end of the novel, but we&#xa0;know that he will be killed a week before the end of the war. Prior's fate becomes a special concern of the novel because it is uncertain. He&#xa0;is an outsider, being an officer from a working-class background, but our knowledge of his thoughts is often alienating.</p> <p>When he encounters Rivers, he becomes a mocking antagonist. As he&#xa0;pursues the half-willing Sarah, he seems to have as much contempt as affection for any woman who is, like her, sexually available.</p> <p>Barker's technique fits her material. This novel about the first world war is set entirely in Britain. In the hospital, a \"living museum of tics and twitches\" as Sassoon thinks of it, we know about the horrors of the western front by the patients' symptoms.</p> <p>Shell-shock being, Rivers believes, a kind of withdrawal from a reality too terrible to contemplate, its victims are involved in a \"hopeless attempt to forget\". Short, horrible stories sometimes attach themselves to traumatised patients, but none of its victims is able to talk about what has unhinged them. We are given some of Prior's and Sassoon's fragmentary memories, but the novel largely imitates the appalled soldiers' habits of repression.</p> <p>When Rivers visits Burns, another victim, in Suffolk, he observes all the symptoms of trauma, but he is able to&#xa0;tell his friend almost nothing about his experiences. When the novel does take us inside Burns's mind, it is to register his suffering without pulling it&#xa0;into consciousness. The novel follows him as he leaves the hospital grounds and travels into the countryside. He ends up under a tree, from which some local farmer has hung the&#xa0;corpses of dead pests: moles and magpies and a fox. Burns strips naked and removes the animals, placing them&#xa0;in a circle around him. \"This was the right place. This was where he wanted to be.\" We are seeing events from his point of view, yet are left to explain as best we can his strange death-ritual and the satisfaction that it&#xa0;gives him.</p> <p>Owen agrees with Sassoon that it is&#xa0;mad not to write about war when it's&#xa0;\u2026&#xa0;\"such an experience\", says Sassoon completing the thought. \"They looked at each other and burst out laughing\" \u2013&#xa0;as if the one benefit of war were to give them <em>material poetica</em>. Rivers's sympathies are limited by his own lack&#xa0;of this experience.</p> <p>Sitting in on one of the \"boards\" at which supposed experts interview shell-shock victims and decide whether they are fit for a return to combat, Rivers is filled with \"the most enormous compassion\" for the soldier. \"Poor little blighter, he thought. Poor all of them.\" Yet this is made to sound like the ignorant reflex of a decent man.&#xa0;\"Poor all of them\": just the response that we, as readers, might now easily feel. Barker's achievement is to&#xa0;make&#xa0;us&#xa0;sense the inadequacy of this&#xa0;sympathy.</p> <p>\u2022 John Mullan is professor of English at University College London.</p>",
  "<p>In 1989, Liu Xiaobo joined the peaceful protest movement centred on Tiananmen Square, and his life changed for ever. On 4 June, the Chinese government violently put down the demonstrations, imposing martial law and massacring hundreds of citizens. Two days later, Liu was arrested and imprisoned for 20 months. He was already known to the communist authorities as a dissident cultural critic, but now his books were banned and he was forbidden to teach.</p> <p>Since then, Liu has become the most&#xa0;outspoken critic of the regime. He has been imprisoned on three further occasions, and is currently serving an 11-year sentence for helping to write <a href=\"http://www.charter08.eu/\" title=\"\">Charter 08</a>, a manifesto calling for democracy, free speech and basic human rights in China. His private response to the massacre has been to commemorate it every year with a poem. <em>June Fourth Elegies</em> makes public the first 20 poems in this sequence.</p> <p>In his afterword, the translator Jeffrey Yang warns the reader that Liu is not a \"wildly imaginative innovator\" and that we should not expect too much linguistic nuance or technical discipline. This seems a little unfair. Admittedly, Liu's poetry is always at the service of his activism, but his obsession with questions of responsibility feeds directly into his poetic concerns: faced with a brutal regime, how should we form and style our response? What should we say, and not say?</p> <p>The stakes are high, and Liu's introduction is highly critical of writers who pose as rebels but avoid direct engagement with politics: \"They've matured without experiencing innocence; they've given up without experiencing the pursuit.\" In one poem, Liu sarcastically asks whether he should \"pretend / to be Wang Wei or Tao Yuanming writing verse by a little stream ...\" In the aftermath of the massacre, the most pressing choice facing Chinese intellectuals was whether to flee China or stay. Liu's poems depict both options as intolerable compromises: those who fled did so \"to continue their grand meals of public opinion and fundraising\", while those who stayed \"had no time to clean the traces of blood from their turn-ups / but plunged head-first into the vast seas of trade\".</p> <p>Liu's decision to stay in China may have been an attempt to atone for a confession he wrote while in Qincheng prison. He is quick to condemn himself for this: \"I betrayed the blood of the departed souls.\" In staying, Liu became an unblinking observer of both the inherent absurdity of totalitarian politics (\"the Communist Youth League celebrates its 80th birthday\"), and its pettiness (\"At Tiananmen Square an armed policeman on / watch used his leather boot to kick and break / apart a child's snowman piled up high\").</p> <p>A powerful sense of history gives further depth to his observations. Liu refers repeatedly to the tomb of <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Qin%20Shi%20Huang\" title=\"\">Qin Shi Huang</a>, the first emperor of China. When Qin died, he had hundreds of soldiers in his Terracotta Army buried alive with him, so that he could rule another empire in the afterlife. This gives Liu a historical emblem of suicidal subservience before tyranny: \"Our endless history depends / on the tombs of the emperors to demonstrate glory\".</p> <p>Blending activism and poetry, Liu has made contravening government policy an aesthetic principle. China forbids its citizens to commemorate the massacre: Liu responds by memorialising the event with a new poem each year. China denies the existence of Aids, and later the Sars virus: Liu repeatedly uses virus imagery in his work. He likens the anniversary of the massacre to \"a fatal virus / no one's willing to approach\", compares the culture of political subservience in China to Aids, and writes of \"Sars politics / a nation is unable to breathe freely\".</p> <p>Yang refers to Liu's \"bold, in-your-face directness\", and this comes through in his surreal, visceral imagery: \"In order to escape the abortion / the baby inside mother's belly / learns how to commit suicide\". However, the tone of Yang's translation is often uncertain rather than bold. In order to translate the work into idiomatic English, Yang would have needed to take more liberties, but he was no doubt unwilling to do this, since he was unable to consult with the imprisoned Liu, or with Liu's wife Liu Xia, who is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/04/china-dissident-wife-liu-xia\" title=\"\">under strict house arrest</a>.</p> <p>Yang says that he found translating in isolation \"painful\" and \"unnerving\", but his understandable decision to convey Liu's meaning as literally as possible leads to some stilted phrasing. For example: \"our disease is so ancient, exceeds / Christ's birth by a great temporal distance\". It is not clear whether Liu wrote these lines in deliberately unidiomatic Chinese, or if something has been lost in translation. Yang also follows Liu's practice of using minimal punctuation: no full stops, and just a comma here or there when absolutely necessary. But in English, this has the effect of muting the anger in the voice.</p> <p>When Liu <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2010/dec/10/nobel-peace-prize-liu-xiaobo-live\" title=\"\">won the Nobel peace prize</a> in October 2010, he was not permitted to attend the ceremony. In his absence, the image of his empty chair became a powerful symbol of Chinese repression. There is something fitting in this, as Liu's poetry challenges itself to&#xa0;make an absent history present, and to give a voice to the politically silenced. As he says in the dedication to one poem: \"The living should really shut their mouths and listen to the graves speak.\"</p> <p>Paul Batchelor's <em>The Sinking Road</em> is published by Bloodaxe.</p>",
  "<p>Herman Koch's <em>The Dinner</em> is, like Christos Tsiolkas's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/08/the-slap-christos-tsiolkas-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Slap</em></a>, a novel whose premise can be neatly reduced. Two couples meet in a fancy restaurant&#xa0;in Amsterdam to discuss an outrage perpetrated by their sons. As the evening progresses, civilised behaviour breaks down, revealing that&#xa0;the parents are not so different from their children.</p> <p>Roman Polanski's 2011 film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1692486/\" title=\"\"><em>Carnage</em></a> covers similar territory; the urbane, liberal sheen is quickly rubbed off two sets of New York parents when they meet to discuss a fight between their sons. In <em>The Dinner</em>, although the boys may be products of their parents, they come from two very different families, and the grotesqueness revealed in the novel is of a different order.</p> <p>The boys' fathers, Paul and Serge Lohman, are brothers. The narrator, Paul, is a teacher \"placed on non-active\", while Serge is a charismatic politician in the running for Holland's premiership. The book is divided into&#xa0;courses, and during the aperitif and appetiser it's hard not to side with Paul's assessment that his richer, better looking, more popular brother is overly smooth, insincere and sexist. Many readers will be inclined to meet Paul halfway on this; after all, even when we're voting for them, who really&#xa0;trusts a politician?</p> <p>Paul's voice is initially beguiling. He describes Serge's rural retreat in France as having \"a whiff of Boursin \u2026 imitation cheese that had nothing to do with French cheese\". But as the novel progresses on to the main course, it becomes increasingly clear that Paul's jibes may not simply be attempts to puncture his brother's hypocrisy. What qualifies him to label Serge a hypocrite? For instance, there is nothing except Paul's insistence that Serge and his wife do not really love their adopted son Beau as much as they love their biological children.</p> <p>The differences between the brothers might suggest that nature and&#xa0;nurture are equally irrelevant, but&#xa0;family bonds are important to Paul. His&#xa0; intense love for his only son Michel is matched by the devotion he feels for his wife Claire. Three-legged structures are the strongest, and together the trio are solid. When Michel and his cousin commit their terrible act, Paul and Claire are forced to decide where their loyalties lie. Are they confined to their small family unit or do they extend to the human family, society? Will the couple sacrifice one for the good of the other?</p> <p>Paul recognises the liberal values professed by his country and his politician brother. He understands the&#xa0;unfairness of sexism and racism and has no problem with homosexuality. Paul is also empathetic, up to a point. He remembers how the face of a schoolchild to whom he said something unrepeatable \"broke down the middle. Like a vase. Or like a glass that shatters at a high pitched note\", but it gradually becomes clear that Paul's keen sense of observation and tendency to analyse others are symptoms of his own dislocation. For Paul is a violent man who needs medication to control his impulses.</p> <p>Koch paces his revelations expertly, and there are twists and turns enough to keep us reading, but his decision to ascribe the former teacher's violent outbreaks to a biological defect \u2013 to make Paul's condition something other than simply the human condition \u2013 diminishes the book. Paul is clearly not \"one of us\", whoever \"we\" may be. But <em>The Dinner</em> is more than its plot, and Paul's voice, combined with his knowledge of his own flawed personality, has the potential to sustain the novel without the drama of the two boys' transgressions and their parents' divided responses.</p> <p>Near the beginning of the novel, Paul quotes the opening sentence of <em>Anna Karenina</em>: \"All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\" By the end&#xa0;of the novel, he has disproved the theory. His own happy family is unique, but happiness isn't everything.</p> <p>\u2022 Louise Welsh's <em>The Girl on the Stairs</em> is published by John Murray.

The well-preserved keep is surrounded by massive earthworks, and I can recommend the child-friendly audio guide.

In 2015 the British Library will celebrate with a large exhibition, but it's also worth visiting the watermeadow by the Thames where King John made peace with rebellious barons in 1215.

Its castle dominates the town, and just outside are the remains of a great medieval priory (<a href=\"http://www.lewespriory.org.uk/\" title=\"\">lewespriory.org.uk</a>, free). Founded in the 11th century, it was one of the richest monastic houses in England, with a church the size of a cathedral. In 1537 the priory was granted to Thomas Cromwell, the architect of the dissolution. Always a man in a hurry, he brought in an Italian engineer to blow up the buildings he didn't want, and built a house called Lord's Place for his son Gregory. The Victorians almost completed the destruction by putting a railway line through, but the beautiful South Downs setting survives, and it's a lovely place for a walk.</p> <p>Just a moment from the priory ruins is <strong>Anne of Cleves House</strong> (<a href=\"http://sussexpast.co.uk/properties-to-discover/anne-of-cleves-house\" title=\"\">sussexpast.co.uk/properties-to-discover/anne-of-cleves-house</a>, \u00a34.70/ \u00a32.40) on Southover High Street. It's doubtful Henry VIII's unwanted fourth wife ever saw this pretty timbered manor, but it was part of her divorce settlement. Its furnished rooms include a splendid bedchamber and a kitchen. The museum displays melancholy stone carvings from the priory, and there is a gallery bristling with weaponry and ironmongery. A house on this scale, unpretentious and domestic, gives a better idea of Tudor life than many more celebrated sites, and there's a calm and pretty garden.</p> <p><strong>Michelham Priory</strong>, near Hailsham in<strong> East Sussex</strong> (<a href=\"http://sussexpast.co.uk/properties-to-discover/michelham-priory\" title=\"\">sussexpast.co.uk/properties-to-discover/michelham-priory</a>, \u00a37.30/\u00a33.90), was another Cromwell property. But this one was treated more gently, so the moated ruins are extensive and atmospheric. Set among orchards and vineyards, it was a small house, with just eight canons in residence in 1537. It's mellow and family-friendly, with a working watermill, a herb garden and a splendid Elizabethan barn.</p> <p><strong>Farleigh Hungerford Castle</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/farleigh-hungerford-castle/\" title=\"\">english-heritage.org.uk</a>, \u00a34/\u00a32.40) in a green valley on the <strong>Somerset-Wiltshire</strong> border, was built in the late 14th century and owned by the Hungerford family for 300 years. It's a ruin, though there is an intact chapel where knights and ladies lie on their tombs. The atmosphere is especially serene, though it's hard to imagine why, because the Hungerfords were a villainous crew. A 16th-century Hungerford had her husband strangled and his remains stuffed in the kitchen furnace. Another tried to starve his poor wife to death, but Henry VIII's headsman put an end to his activities. A 17th-century Hungerford gambled away the manor in a game of bowls. English Heritage has restored the site in an intelligent and sympathetic way.</p> <p>Just where you don't expect a Tudor house, on Homerton High Street in gritty Hackney, east <strong>London</strong> stands <strong>Sutton House </strong>(<a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/sutton-house/\" title=\"\">nationaltrust.org.uk/sutton-house</a>, \u00a33/\u00a31). It was called Bricke Place in 1535, when it was new and gleaming and built amid fields. The National Trust shows off dark panelled rooms that have survived many owners, but it's close to my heart because its builder was one of my favourite Tudors. Trained by Thomas Cromwell, Ralph Sadler attained high favour with Henry VIII, and built Bricke Place for his bride. Ralph was an ambitious young courtier and she was a widow, a servant; it was a love match; the curators will tell you about the bizarre turn that events took when Lady Sadler's first husband rose from the dead. Ralph Sadler was still working at the age of 85, in harness at the trial of Mary Queen of Scots. He outlived all his generation, and died the richest commoner in England. <br><em>\u2022 Hilary Mantel's novel about the life of Thomas Cromwell, Wolf Hall (Fourth Estate \u00a39.99), won the Man Booker Prize in 2009.

It's perched on a hilltop near Junction 29a south of Sheffield, and you can't help but stare as you pass. It looks like a fairytale castle, with dinky battlements and turrets. Although it appears older, it is a Gothic, chivalric, romantic recreation of a medieval castle begun in the 1610s. It incorporates up-to-the-minute details from Italy, such as naked classical gods and goddesses having an orgy, and \"lascivious beasts\" decorating the fountain of Venus in its garden.</p> <p>The<strong> Banqueting House </strong>in Whitehall, <strong>London</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.hrp.org.uk/banquetinghouse/\" title=\"\">hrp.org.uk</a>, \u00a35/free), designed by Inigo Jones, represents the future of British architecture. Built in the 1620s, and the only surviving bit of the great, lost palace of Whitehall, the Banqueting House prefigures all those later, classical, Georgian museums and terraces and government buildings. It's easy to miss it as you walk along Whitehall, because it looks so familiar, but it really was the first of its kind. Inside, Rubens painted ceilings immortalising the Stuart dynasty. This is why, in a moment of delicious irony, the Parliamentarians chose to execute King Charles I directly outside.</p> <p>Go to <strong>Ham House</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/ham-house/\" title=\"\">nationaltrust.org.uk/ham-house</a>, \u00a39.90/\u00a35.50)<strong> </strong>in <strong>Richmond</strong>, west London, for life after the Restoration, including tiny, richly decorated 17th-century closets used as repositories for jewels, secrets and silence. Charles II, his dissolute courtier buddies and his merry mistresses enjoyed themselves in interiors like these. Nearly a century from where we started, <strong>Hampton Court Palace </strong>(<a href=\"http://www.hrp.org.uk/hamptoncourtpalace/\" title=\"\">hrp.org.uk</a>, \u00a316.95/\u00a38.50) heralds the arrival of the baroque and the influence of France rather than Italy. Built from 1689 by William and Mary, after they deposed the despotic and Catholic James II, this is a palace for a pair of constitutional monarchs. It's the British version of Versailles: Louis XIV was an absolute monarch, and his grandiloquent palace reflects his absolute power. William and Mary had given some royal power away to Parliament, so their palace is a cut-price version: beautiful, yet also warm and friendly, with cheap red brick as well as expensive white stone. <br><em>\u2022 Dr Lucy Worsley is the chief curator of Historic Royal Palaces and a TV presenter</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395037377\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/17/1345199066224/Stourhead-House-Wiltshire-001.jpg\" alt=\"Stourhead House, Wiltshire\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stourhead House, Wiltshire.

A strange, rebuilt, room-sized Colossus machine is on display here.</p> <p>Imagine how badly Britain needed a fillip after the wartime battering and the austerity and rationing that followed. The Festival of Britain in 1951 was this \"tonic for the nation\", and its centerpiece was the <strong>Royal Festival Hall </strong>(<a href=\"http://ticketing.southbankcentre.co.uk/venues/royal-festival-hall\" title=\"\">southbankcentre.co.uk</a>) on <strong>London</strong>'s South Bank. A modernist shock in a shattered city, the site also included the futuristic Skylon rocket and the aluminium Dome of Discovery. A quarter of the population came to look, and though the Skylon and Dome are gone, the hall still gives a sense of Britain reinventing itself. <br><em>\u2022 Dave Musgrove is associate publisher of BBC History Magazine</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 22 August 2012 to clarify Professor Stephen Harding's affiliation.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/16/fiction.alangarner\" title=\"\">Alan Garner</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/8034300/The-Weirdstone-ofBrisingamen-review.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Weirdstone of Brisingamen</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.sfsite.com/11b/gom45.htm\" title=\"\"><em>The Moon of Gomrath</em></a> are classics of 20th-century children's literature. Tracing the adventures of the children Colin and Susan as they battle the forces of evil and fall into the world of legend, the books led <a href=\"http://www.philip-pullman.com/\" title=\"\">Philip Pullman</a> to describe Garner as \"the most important British writer of fantasy since Tolkien\". It's startling, then, to learn that the author, nearing the end of <em>The Moon of Gomrath</em> in 1962, was tempted to throw in the towel in disgust.</p> <p>\"I could not go on. The book was within a few pages of its end, but I'd had enough,\" says Garner. He had come to \"loath\" the characters, describing them as \"zeroes\", the novels as \"drivel\". He brought the story to a swift, unexpected conclusion. He pauses: \"Wait, I think I can do it\", and&#xa0;he recites from memory. \"'We wins!' said the Morrigan from the rhododendron bushes. And when the moon came out and the house reappeared, she went up to the room where Colin was and wrung the little bugger's neck.\"</p> <p>Garner twinkles ferociously as he recites the lines. But he forced himself to find a more suitable ending, finished <em>The Moon of Gomrath</em> by the age of 27, and vowed \u2013 despite entreaties from a publisher \u2013 not to cash in on his now-established name and turn the hugely popular novels into a series.</p> <p>Why, then, more than 50 years since <em>Weirdstone</em> was published, is he returning to Colin in <a href=\"http://www.harpercollins.co.uk/Titles/76491/boneland-alan-garner-9780007463244\" title=\"\"><em>Boneland</em></a>, the much-hoped-for, never-expected concluding volume in the <em>Weirdstone</em> trilogy? \"I'd no idea that I was going to write the book at first. But I was thinking for a long time about what Colin would have done,\" says Garner. By then he was \"too embroiled\" in his&#xa0;adult novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/18/fiction.alangarner\" title=\"\"><em>Thursbitch</em></a> to do anything with it, but in 2003 <em>Thursbitch</em> was done and he \"realised that there was, 40 years on, unfinished business\".</p> <p><em>Boneland</em> imagines Colin as an adult, a troubled, brilliant astrophysicist who can remember every single thing that has happened to him since the age of 13, but nothing before. From his job at Jodrell Bank, he searches endlessly, fruitlessly, for his sister in the stars: where is Susan, and what happened to her? Bringing together elements of his novels <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Strandloper-Harvill-Panther-Alan-Garner/dp/1860461611\" title=\"\"><em>Strandloper</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/book-of-a-lifetime-red-shift-by-alan-garner-2196201.html\" title=\"\"><em>Red Shift</em></a>, twisting and twining through Colin's story is that of a man from an ancient time, The Watcher, whose lonely quest plays out in language redolent of myth. Although <em>Weirdstone </em>contains one of the most disturbing images in all of children's literature \u2013 Colin and Susan crawling through a tunnel deep beneath the earth \u2013 Garner says <em>Boneland</em> is the first of his novels genuinely to scare him. \"I don't think I've ever frightened myself before when writing but there were areas where there was terror, as though I was looking into somewhere that I didn't know existed before, and it frightened me.\"</p> <p>He admits the novel isn't likely to appeal to children. \"Fourth Estate are trying to make it as clear as possible that this is not going to be full of elves and witches. I think inside the dust jacket it says it is an adult book. My attitude is that if anybody of any age wants to read a book, let them, but I do&#xa0;think that no child would want to read <em>Boneland</em>.\"</p> <p>We are talking in his home in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, the landscape of which is important in his books. Garner sits on a comfortable, battered old couch in the cool of the 16th-century timber-frame apothecary's house he moved, piece by piece, from its original setting where it was about to be demolished. <a href=\"http://www.neilgaiman.com/\" title=\"\">Neil Gaiman</a> says he is \"in awe of [Garner's] use of small, simple words, the way he shapes the rocky crags and high tors and deep caves of plot and story with words that feel like he hewed them, or whittled them, or flaked them from flint\". But despite his standing, the author is not usually recognised \u2013 even by the tourists who flock to Alderley Edge to tread in the footsteps of his characters. He recounts the story of the time he had his head down an intriguing hole (he is fascinated by archaeology) and heard a school party walking by, and a teacher spouting nonsense about his books. \"I don't believe there even is an Alan Garner,\" a child at the back muttered. He was tempted to withdraw his head and prove otherwise \u2013 but decided it wouldn't be worth it.</p> <p>Garner grew up in Alderley Edge and can trace his ancestors there back over four centuries. As a child he played on the hill under which local legend says an army of knights sleep, guarded by a wizard until they are needed \u2013 a myth that became the basis for <em>Weirdstone</em>. He was the first of his family to go to grammar school, and from there to Oxford. But it was a comment his grandfather Joseph made when he was a child that made him realise he was going to be a writer.</p> <p>\"My background is deep and set in deep time, and in a narrow space, oral traditions going back a long, long time, which I inherited by osmosis. But I would come home from school and start trying to explain my excitement over irregular verbs, and the family could not take that, and so the price of education was alienation. I was seen as someone who was just trying to make a fool of the rest of the family. I wasn't at all,\" he says. \"I didn't drift away from the family, the family emotionally just cut me off. Apart from my grandfather, who was a smith, who said, 'if the other feller can do it, let him'.\" He meant find your unique quality, and pursue it, and the notion resonated \u2013 continues to resonate \u2013 with Garner.</p> <p><sup>'</sup>I realised there was no point in trying to bridge the gap. I was intelligent, my family was intelligent, but I was the one who had gone the other way,\" he tries to explain. \"So I do remember thinking what on earth am I going to do, what have we in common? It was the landscape. Because my family knew the landscape and I knew it in the same way, but I also knew that landscape was Triassic sandstone, and it was 43m years old \u2026 It was the area where I could draw on all the richness that otherwise would be lost in me if separation was allowed to become destructive.\"</p> <p><em>Weirdstone</em> took him two years to write, one year to find a publisher, one year to publish: \"four years of dole queues and national assistance\", as he writes in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Voice-That-Thunders-Alan-Garner/dp/1860463320\" title=\"\"><em>The Voice that Thunders</em></a>, a collection of critical and autobiographical essays. Today, Garner says it is clear that in his first two books he couldn't handle character or dialogue, but \"I did know the landscape, and looking as objectively as I can at those first two books and trying not to cringe, that young man, me, had a keen eye for landscape, and the ability to convey it\".</p> <p>He went on to work as a freelance television reporter, which he credits with vastly improving the dialogue in his novels, and wrote <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0106x1h\" title=\"\"><em>Elidor</em></a>, the bleakly brilliant story of four Manchester children who win \"treasures\" in another world, and have to protect them in this one. His Carnegie-winning <a href=\"http://www.theowlservice.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>The Owl Service</em></a>, a terrifying tale of possession and myth set in a Welsh valley, and the perplexing <em>Red Shift</em> followed; they cemented his position as an author at \"the prickly edge of myth\", says Gaiman \u2013 \"someone whose children's books seemed peculiarly grown up, whose adult fiction seems timeless\".</p> <p>It took 12 years for his next novel, <em>Strandloper</em> \u2013 based on the true story of Cheshire man William Buckley, who was deported to Australia in 1801 \u2013 to be completed. Part of the reason the novels take so long is the sheer volume of research Garner does \u2013 learning Welsh for <em>The Owl Service</em>, becoming knowledgeable in, variously, the thieves' language of Cant and the Celtic cult of the human head for <em>Strandloper</em>. Garner doesn't believe he has original ideas \u2013 just that he puts them together in a unique way. So <em>The Owl Service</em> draws from the <a href=\"http://www.mabinogion.info/\" title=\"\"><em>Mabinogion</em></a> and from his wife Griselda's chance realisation that the flowers on a dinner plate could be re-combined to form owls, <em>Elidor</em> from the ballad Childe Rowland and Burd Ellen, <em>Red Shift</em> from the story of <a href=\"http://myths.e2bn.org/mythsandlegends/origins530-thomas-the-rhymer-and-the-queen-of-elfland.html\" title=\"\"><em>Tamlain and the Queen of Elfland</em></a>.</p> <p>Inspiration usually comes when he's \"listening to music or just looking out of the window. I use the metaphor of a foot slipping off the curb and jolting, that I often used to have in dreams. So the ideas start to come, and words start to flow.\" Early on, though, they don't flow at all. \"I've learned never to try and force words to come.\" At first he writes in short bursts, \"dollops\", moving from \"this sort of intermittent period, it gradually accelerates until I can't stop. The last few days or the last week is really very stressful physically. I just eat sleep write eat sleep write, and the clock is nowhere in it, doesn't matter what time of day or night it is.\"</p> <p>This frenzy of authorship is part of the manic depression Garner was diagnosed with in 1989 \u2013 \"the best news that I have ever heard\", as he writes in <em>The Voice that Thunders</em>, as it explained years of mania and inertia, including a two-year period when he lay either in the kitchen or in bed, \"12 months of 12 hours each day on the settle, my face to the wall, waiting only for the 12 hours in bed\". Elements of the psychotherapy he received after he \"went seemingly mad in less than three months\" following the adaptation of <em>The Owl Service</em> for television \u2013 \"Go to the pain,\" he was told by his therapist, \"go to where it hurts the most, and say whatever it tells you\" \u2013 weave themselves tightly into <em>Boneland</em>, as Colin attempts to unpick his own tangled mental state. That part, he says, was very hard for his wife to read.</p> <p>Coming to an end of a book can be a dark time for Garner, but he is upbeat today, even though he is almost sure that <em>Boneland</em> will be his last work. \"I can't imagine, being realistic, that at the age of 77, and taking about a decade to write a book even when I've got an idea \u2013 which I haven't got at the moment \u2013 that it wouldn't be foolish to engage in it,\" he says. \"I don't think I've got the time or the energy to undergo things like <em>Strandloper</em>, <em>Thursbitch</em> and <em>Boneland</em>.\"</p> <p>And yet, and yet \u2026 \"something's going on, and the shape it's taking is interesting in that it's complete at whatever stage I finish it. In other words, provided I get a few paragraphs down and then I just drop dead, it's still complete. It's intriguing me. It's making me think here we go again, perhaps, but in a quite different way,\" says Garner. \"I cannot conceive of not writing. Because everything is so interesting. I've got lots of other things I could pretend to retire into, such as doing more on the academic side, doing more archaeology, doing more historical research, but there are other people who can do that. And I am actually quite haunted by this idea of having to do what only the individual can do.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 August 2012 because the original said Alderley Edge is near Cheshire.

  "<p>Aerial spraying to combat the West Nile virus will continue Friday night across north Texas despite the concerns of residents worried about potential health risks posed by the insecticide.</p> <p>Dallas is the center of the worst West Nile outbreak in the US this year, which prompted local officials to declare a state of emergency on Wednesday and dispatch two airplanes to spray the city and surrounding areas last night.</p> <p>The planes left Dallas' Executive Airport as planned at 10pm last night but were only able to spray about 52,000 acres, just over half their target, because of rain.</p> <p>\"We'll look at our weather patterns tonight and see if we can add to the remaining block. We have two planes coming in today. If we have good weather, we can get 124,000 acres every three-and-a-half hours with two planes, so four planes would give us right at a quarter of a million acres. So, weather permitting, we'll try to get that,\" Dallas County judge Clay Jenkins told WFAA.com.</p> <p>The area could be sprayed again in the coming days once the effectiveness of this week's efforts to reduce the mosquito population have been assessed.<br>Confirmed West Nile virus deaths in Dallas and surrounding counties have now reached 14, with over 230 cases. The Texas Department of State Health Services has recorded 509 cases and 20 deaths across Texas, compared with two fatalities last year.</p> <p>Texas is by far the worst-hit state, with more than half of all US cases, though news media today suggested that the virus is gaining a foothold in the Chicago region. At least 26 people have died across the nation, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reporting that it was aware of 693 human infections through the second week in August. The CDC said that six people have died in Louisiana.</p> <p>West Nile was discovered in the US in 1999. Instances of infection typically peak from late August to early September each year. Scientists believe it is transmitted to humans when mosquitoes bite infected birds, then people.<br>About 80% of humans do not become ill after a bite, but around one in five may develop flu-like symptoms. Less than 1% of victims develop severe infections that can cause neurological diseases.</p> <p>Some counties adjacent to the city of Dallas have opted out of the aerial spraying, though many are using ground-based pesticides.</p> <p>Cities such as New York, Houston and Sacramento have previously used aerial spraying. Houston, Texas' largest city, has done so every year since 2002. However, Dallas has not employed the tactic since 1966, which has helped breed local anxiety about the safety of the method.</p> <p>Council members and residents have expressed doubts but the mayor, Mike Rawlings, insisted at a media briefing on Thursday that the Duet pesticide was safe. However, the mayor did concede this week that the pesticide can be harmful to useful insects, such as honey bees.</p> <p>It is a synthetic pyrethroid which imitates natural pesticides found in some chrysanthemums. \"There's a lot of sentiment that people don't want this, and there's a fear of the unknown,\" he said. You have the science, the CDC and EPA and all of these cities across the United States that say this is OK.\"</p> <p>Jenny Land, a Dallas resident who has previously made recommendations to the city on mosquito control, strongly disagrees. \"I think [aerial spraying] is a political, fear-based statement to say to people, 'Look, we're doing something,'\" she told the Guardian.</p> <p>Duet has been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency for mosquito control but the product label says it is toxic to fish and other aquatic organisms.</p> <p>\"They're egregiously saying it's safe but there are known health risks with every pesticide. When you spray anything off the back of an airplane you can't be sure where it lands,\" Land said. \"They have a moral obligation to let citizens know what the risks are.\"</p> <p>Dr David Lakey, the Texas health commissioner, told reporters this week that the risk posed by the chemicals was negligible compared with the threat of a West Nile epidemic and that the widespread use of aerial spraying in other large urban areas for many years indicated the method was not dangerous.</p> <p>Still, a Texas department of state health services statement recommends precautions \"for people concerned about exposure during aerial spraying\" that include staying indoors, keeping pets inside, washing exposed skin or clothes with soap and water, covering small fish ponds and rinsing home-grown fruits and vegetables with water.</p> <p>Land said that she has temporarily relocated to Austin because she has an immune system disorder and fears the spraying could worsen her condition. \"I have a close family friend scheduled to come into Dallas for medical treatment who's on 24-hour oxygen,\" she said. \"The pulmonologist said to her, 'Do not come to Dallas, do not take the risk.'\"</p> <p>The company conducting the Dallas aerial treatment, Clarke, was fined $1m by state and federal authorities in 2001 for using untrained and unsupervised workers while spraying New York.</p> <p>A pressure group, Dallas, Stop The Spray! has collected more than 1,800 signatures on a petition that calls for \"the city to stop the ineffective and dangerous mosquito spraying and instead, channel equivalent funds and efforts to implement safer and proven practices for mosquito prevention and eradication.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/unfairpark/2012/08/the_rest_of_dallas_county_will.php\">According to the Dallas Observer</a>, Jenkins said Friday afternoon that no hospitals in the region reported any admissions related to West Nile on Thursday night, nor was there evidence of any sudden increases in asthma attacks following the spraying. He said the pesticide was \"an incredible risk to West Nile-bearing mosquitoes... but not an unreasonable risk to you or your family.\"</p> <p>He added that any legal attempts to halt the spraying, such as the filing of a court injunction, would not succeed given the sweeping powers afforded to the mayor while the city is under a state of emergency.</p>",
  "<p>The book, not just as a source of knowledge or entertainment, but as an intrinsically pleasing object, is a familiar theme. Indeed, it came up yet again in this newspaper's letters pages earlier this week. The point of this latest diatribe against the rise of the ebook was that physical books leave a trace, can be passed on, enhance a room, rekindle (no pun intended) a memory. And yet for most of my life, voracious and indiscriminate book reader though I&#xa0;am, the printed book has been nothing but a tease: a will-o'-the-wisp holding out what might be possible, only to snatch it away as soon as I reach for it.</p> <p>The perversity comes in my reaching for it at all. I was born blind, and reading for me has always meant braille. I've had much fun and satisfaction from books, but they are the one case where I've not been able to adhere to my rule of not mourning what I couldn't have. With only a tiny proportion of books published available in braille \u2013 well under 1% \u2013 the world's literature was not so much offered up to you as dangled in front of you. To be fair, the classics were there \u2013 like the Desert Island Discs castaways, we had Shakespeare and the Bible, the latter stretching over more than a hundred volumes, thanks to the bulk of braille books \u2013 but not what kids want to read. To illustrate, my blind school's braille library had one Famous Five book, one Billy Bunter, one Just William and, as I grew older, one PG Wodehouse and one James Bond.</p> <p>It was a subtle form of torture: just enough to suck you in, no chance to do that reader's thing of devouring the whole canon, start to finish, in an orgy of excess. And this is where my love-hate relationship with the printed book, and the bookshop, starts. I remember going into them with my mum, running my fingers along the shelves, letting the edges of pages slip through my fingers. Was this, perhaps, Five Go Bungee-Jumping, or William and the Outlaws Learn to Rap? It's been no better since I've been an adult, although instead of Blyton, Crompton and Frank Richards, I've obsessed about the latest Sebastian Faulks, tacky bonkbuster or political biography. I have all the sensory hankerings of the book-lover \u2013 the smell of the paper; the satisfying crack of opening a new book; the pleasingly rounded feel of the spine \u2013 with none of&#xa0;the satisfaction of reading them.</p> <p>I suppose at this point I had better forestall the avalanche of suggestions from puzzled wellwishers, wondering that I have not heard of the talking book. I have, of course, and very good some of them are \u2013 but it's not reading, is it? Yet&#xa0;there's good news. This column is not to be a sustained whinge. There is a&#xa0;happy ending.</p> <p>I have just spent much of my holiday browsing in bookshops \u2013 and not as a form of self-flagellation, but looking for books I am actually going to be able to read. The much-maligned technological revolution has come up with the answer I thought I would never live to see: braille books, virtually on demand. It's now possible, with the right combination of hardware and software, to buy a book at 9am, scan it page by page, then use a screen-reader to render it either into synthetic speech, or into braille, and be reading it by lunchtime.</p> <p>If this were all, it would be a great advance; but you don't have to be tied to the computer to read your book. You can download it on to a flash card, which you can insert into a portable braille reader. Result: hundreds of books on each tiny card, at the touch of a button. Again, I know this is not new. It's been around for at least 15 years. But I am a natural luddite, and have had to go through the four stages of finding out about it, learning to believe that it had anything to do with me, figuring out physically how to do it, and finally allowing it to revolutionise my life.</p> <p>There are drawbacks, some of which I'll come to, but just let me glory for a little longer in the freedom to browse at all. I am now a familiar figure in the bookshops of Winchester, especially the secondhand ones, of which we're lucky enough to have quite a few. It has to be mainly secondhand ones, because like a kid in a sweetshop, particularly a kid who wasn't allowed sweets for a long time, I am in danger of gorging myself and making myself sick. Secondhand is the only way of keeping my spending under some sort of control.</p> <p>I suspect I'm not a universally popular browser. I need a companion to find the right section, to read titles and reviews and maybe even the beginning of the book \u2013 all the things typical browsers do, but not aloud. I don't find secondhand bookshops stuffy \u2013 there's a camaraderie among book hunters \u2013 but even so, I&#xa0;sometimes feel the growing disapproval of the quiet carriage on the train: \"We'll stand one phone call, but not three.\"</p> <p>I'm quite happy with my companion-in-chief, a book-loving son who over the years has patiently read and precised books for me, and is now trying to decide whether the role of browser- and scanner-in-chief is more or less arduous. Over the past couple of weeks, in the delightful disordered anarchy that is secondhand bookshops, I've managed to pick up everything from a cultural survey of the Weimar republic to a treatise on goalkeeping, via biographies as disconnected as Marie Antoinette and Kim Philby, Rudyard Kipling and Jimmy Hoffa; try out authors whose names have caught my fancy in reviews, such as Alison Lurie and Marian Keyes; and make random decisions about what I&#xa0;read, rather than have those decisions made for me by the equally random whim of the committee that decides what is put into braille. Suddenly, I can pursue impulses, such as my search for Cynthia Asquith's ghost stories, or a decent account of the South Africans in&#xa0;England in 1955, the first cricket test series I can dimly remember following.</p> <p>It's not perfect yet. Scanning books page by page is tedious; variations of type and print size can often produce equally variable results, which require skilful editing to make legible; and every time someone upgrades software or changes an operating system, you find yourself back at square one. With books being produced electronically as a matter of course, publishers, authors and agents could be much more helpful. Surely a way of making digital versions of books available to blind people prepared to pay for them, or borrow them under clearly defined conditions, could be devised without bringing down the publishing industry in an explosion of piracy?</p> <p>While we wait for the publishers and&#xa0;the blind organisations to get their&#xa0;fingers out, we blind readers take matters into our own hands, passing our scanned books quietly among ourselves like kids with drugs on street corners. But hey! For a few of us lucky enough to have the equipment, the money and the help, things are so much better today. Now it's me who is able to take as many books on holiday as I like, all packed on those little cards, while my wife has to limit herself to three or four paperbacks. The days of War and Peace in 21 braille volumes, slipping the postman's disc as he staggers up the path, are nearly over.</p>",

Judge Marina Syrova said she rejected their arguments that they had not intended to offend religious believers but were protesting against the Orthodox church's support&#xa0;for Putin.</p> <p>The case has galvanised Russia's anti-Putin protest movement and raised the international profile of their cause, with dozens of protests held worldwide.</p> <p>British and American officials were quick to condemn what they described as a \"disproportionate\" sentence. The Foreign Office minister, Alistair Burt, said: \"I am deeply concerned by the sentencing of three members of the band Pussy Riot, which can only be considered a disproportionate response to an expression of political belief.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the US state department said: \"We urge Russian authorities to review this case and ensure that the right to freedom of expression is upheld.\"</p> <p>Catherine Ashton, the EU's high representative, said she was disappointed by the verdict. \"It puts a serious question mark over Russia's respect for international obligations of fair, transparent, and independent legal process,\" she said.</p> <p>Putin has alleged that foreign powers are behind the protest movement against his rule, launched shortly after he announced last autumn that he was returning to the presidency.</p> <p>Pussy Riot's supporters and opposition activists accused Putin of personally orchestrating the case against them. \"They are in jail because it is Putin's personal revenge,\" said Alexey Navalny, the opposition's de facto leader. \"The verdict was written by Vladimir Putin.\"</p> <p>The three women were <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/mar/06/russian-punks-pussy-riot-putin-protest\" title=\"\">arrested in March after performing an anti-Putin \"punk prayer\" inside Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour</a>. The case against them is seen as serving two functions: a warning to other dissidents, and an appeal to Putin's conservative base. Russia's growing campaign against gay rights is seen as a part of that effort, and on Friday Moscow's main court upheld a 100-year ban on gay pride rallies.</p> <p>On Friday night, the Russian Orthodox church repeated its criticism of the band's \"blasphemous\" protest, which it said displayed \"crude hostility towards millions of people\" but called on state authorities \"to show mercy to the people convicted within the framework of the law, in the hope that they will refrain from repeating blasphemous actions\".</p> <p>Dozens of protesters were arrested outside court, including chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov and leftist opposition leader Sergei Udaltsov. Hundreds more remained long after the court session had ended, shouting: \"Russia without Putin!\"</p> <p>More than a dozen people have been arrested for taking part in a protest on 6 May against Putin, and could be jailed or fined under a new law against unauthorised demonstrations.</p> <p>Navalny faces up to 10 years in prison after he was charged in a fraud case widely seen as an excuse to crack down on his activism. The country's rubber-stamp parliament has recently passed a law forcing nongovernmental organisations that receive international grants to declare themselves \"foreign agents\", and another that could prompt widespread censorship of the internet.</p> <p>Protests in support of Pussy Riot were held around the world in New York, Vienna and dozens of other cities. The Royal Court theatre in London staged verbatim readings of the women's closing statement to the court to coincide with the verdict. Sir Paul McCartney, Madonna, and Bj\u00f6rk are among the dozens of stars who have issued messages of support. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch called the sentence a bitter blow to freedom of expression inside Russia.</p> <p>Activists said the case has only strengthened the growing movement against Putin's rule. \"Russia must stop being a laughing stock in the eyes of the world,\" said one woman protesting outside the court, who declined to give her name. \"We must join civilised society. I really want to hope that our government will find common sense and stop showing itself in such a monstrous way.\"</p> <p>Boris Akunin, one of Russia's most popular authors, said that the verdict had doomed Putin to \"another year and a half of international shame and humiliation.\"</p> <p>Other supporters were less optimistic. Tolokonnikova's husband Pyotr Verzilov said blame for the verdict rested with one man alone: \"Whatever Putin wants, Putin gets.\"</p> <p>In public statements made earlier this month, Putin had called for the women to be judged \"not too severely\". Prosecutors had asked for a three-year sentence.</p> <p>The women remained defiant throughout the trial, issuing powerful closing statements that quickly entered the canon of Russia's dissident speeches. \"We have won,\" Samutsevich said in her closing statement. \"The whole world now sees that the criminal case against us has been fabricated. The system cannot conceal the repressive nature of this trial. Once again, the world sees Russia differently than the way Putin tries to present it.\" The women intend to appeal against the sentence.</p>",

Angling is a pastime that is enjoyed by people of all shapes and sizes from age 3 to 103. It also generates \u00a33.5bn for the UK economy and is beneficial for health and wellbeing, including those recovering from breast cancer and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p> <p>Anglers have probably done more than anyone to restore wildlife in rivers by investing in projects to restore damaged habitats, reporting pollution and contributing \u00a325m each year in rod licences to the Environment Agency. It's true the Angling Trust is campaigning to reduce the red tape in getting a licence to control cormorants, which are damaging fish stocks on many rivers, but we do not want to rid our waterways of these birds. We are also campaigning and taking civil legal action to improve flows, water quality and habitat for the benefit of all aquatic wildlife.

  "<p>Nosisieko Jali's husband is missing. She has heard a rumour that a bullet hit him in the head, yet he survived. One witness said all his clothes were torn. \"I don't know where he is,\" said Jali, numb with anxiety. \"The hospital wouldn't let me come inside. I am hurting.\"</p> <p>Jali is among scores of wives at the Lonmin platinum mine in Marikana still waiting to discover if their husband is in a jail, hospital or mortuary after one of the bloodiest days in South Africa since apartheid.</p> <p>Thirty-four people were killed and 78 injured on Thursday when police with automatic rifles, pistols and shotguns opened fire on the strikers, many of whom were armed with spears, machetes and clubs as they demonstrated for higher wages. The shocking images, beamed to TV viewers around the world, provoked comparisons with massacres by the white minority regime of the country's past.</p> <p>On Friday, next to the killing field, wives took the place of their dead and wounded husbands to stage an angry, emotionally charged demonstration. The women raged against police brutality, mine exploitation and a lack of official information that has left them agonisingly in the dark.</p> <p>\"How can we know whether people are dead or missing?\" demanded Nowelcime Bosanathi, 35. \"My husband went to the protest with a stick. I worried he might be dead. Then he called last night to say he's in a police van and he doesn't know where he's going. Now his phone is on voicemail.\"</p> <p>Waving sticks, whistling and ululating, the women performed the apartheid-era <em>toyi-toyi</em> dance up and down a dirt road. They sang songs, some mournful, some defiant, warning: \"When you strike a woman, you strike a rock\" and invoking the memory of heroes of the anti-apartheid struggle such as Oliver Tambo. They joined hands in a circle for a soulful rendition of Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika, the national anthem and originally a hymn. They kneeled before police armed with shotguns and sang \"What have we done?\" in the Xhosa language.</p> <p>The group of about 100 women also brandished homemade cardboard placards with handwritten slogans condemning the police. \"Police stop shooting our husbands and sons,\" one said. Another, referring to the new national police commissioner, Riah Phiyega, read: \"Piega you celebrating your position by blood of our families.\"</p> <p>Primrose South, 51, was still waiting for news about Mishack Mzilikazi, 35, who lives on her property and is considered part of the family. \"I last saw him at 8am on Thursday. He was going to work with his phone but now it's off. He also had a stick and he was quiet.</p> <p>\"I don't know where he is now. He could be in prison or he could be dead. I don't know.\"</p> <p>She added: \"We are feeling bad because the children now are crying, are hungry, are afraid even to sleep at night. The wives have no husbands now. Their husbands are lying dead in the forest.\"</p> <p>Whatever did happen here there is no shortage of blame \u2013 and competing accounts. The women point at the police and the Lonmin mine management.</p> <p>South, who works as a mine store manager, said: \"The management sent the police to kill our husbands, brothers and sons. But we will fight for our rights like them.\"</p> <p>Many of these women followed their husbands from Eastern Cape province or neighbouring countries such as Lesotho, Swaziland or Zimbabwe. They live in the nearby Nkanini settlement in cramped shacks with pit toilets and an intermittent water supply. Above one of one of the world's richest platinum deposits, goats wander in adjacent scrubland strewn with discarded plastic bags and rubbish.</p> <p>They denied that the workers had opened fire first and said a turf war between rival unions was a sideshow to the dispute over pay.</p> <p>The unions are scrapping for members. The National Union of Mineworkers, a supporter of the ANC, had signed up to a pay deal with Lonmin. But the militant Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) rejected this and pushed for wages to be trebled. This comes amid a wider debate on whether the governing African National Congress (ANC) should curb mine owners' power.</p> <p>The youth league of the ANC argues that nationalisation of the country's mines and farms is the only way to redress the injustices of the past. The youth league said: \"South Africa's exploitative mining regime, capitalist greed and the poverty of our people is the cause.\"</p> <p>For its part, Lonmin announced that it would provide support to all the families that have suffered loss this week. Simon Scott, its chief financial officer, said: \"We have established a help desk at Lonmin's Andrew Saffy Hospital, which will help families with the identification of bodies, assist with all the burial arrangements and offer bereavement counselling.</p> <p>\"Lonmin commits to provide funding for the education of all the children of employees who lost their lives. This funding will cover education costs from primary school to university.\"</p> <p>The company's London-listed share price slumped 9% early yesterday, though it ended 1.3% down at 639.5p. It plunged to a nine-year low on the Johannesburg exchange, where it is also listed.</p> <p>The South African Institute of Race Relations called for the immediate suspension of all police officers involved in the shootings.</p> <p>It said: \"There is clear evidence that policemen randomly shot into the crowd with rifles and handguns. There is also evidence of their continuing to shoot after a number of bodies can be seen dropping and others turning to run.</p> <p>\"This is reminiscent of the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/21/newsid_2653000/2653405.stm\" title=\"\">Sharpeville massacre</a> in 1960,\" it said.</p> <p>The police, though, insisted they acted in self-defence, arguing that the mine workers even possessed a pistol taken from a police officer they are alleged to have beaten to death on Monday.</p> <p>At least 10 other people were killed during the week-old strike at the mine,80 miles north-west of Johannesburg, including two police officers said to have been battered to death by strikers and two mine security guards.</p> <p>It was into this highly charged atmosphere that President Jacob Zuma stepped, having cut short a visit to a regional summit. He announced that a commission of inquiry would be held into the tragedy. \"This inquiry will enable us to get to the real cause of the incident and derive the real lessons too,\" he said during a visit to Marikana.</p> <p>\"We've all been saddened and dismayed by the events of the past few days and hours around the Marikana mine. The loss of life among workers and members of the police service is tragic and regrettable.</p> <p>\"These events are not what we want to see or want to become accustomed to in a democracy that is bound by the rule of law and where we are creating a better life for all our people.</p> <p>\"Today our thoughts are primarily with the families of those who have lost their lives. As a government and as fellow citizens, we offer our sincere condolences to families who have lost their loved ones. Our thoughts are also with those who are recovering.\"</p> <p>He continued: \"The events of the past few days have unfortunately been visited upon a nation that is hard at work addressing the persistent challenges of poverty, unemployment and inequality.</p> <p>\"We undertake this work in conditions of peace and stability, working with all sectors in our country.</p> <p>\"We assure the South African people in particular that we remain fully committed to ensuring that this country remains a peaceful, stable, productive and thriving nation, that is focused on improving the quality of life of all, especially the poor and working class.</p> <p>\"It is against this background that we have to uncover the truth about what happened here.\"</p> <p>He went on: \"Today challenges us to restore calm and share the pain of the affected families and communities.</p> <p>\"This is not a day to apportion blame. It is a day for us to mourn together as a&#xa0;nation. It is also a day to start rebuilding and healing.\"</p>",
  "<p>No one who remembers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/17/moors-murders-timeline?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">the Moors murders</a>, which ended with Ian Brady and Myra Hindley being sentenced to life imprisonment for the child killings in 1966, will dispute that they were the most shocking criminal case of that era \u2013 not least because the trial followed soon after the abolition of the death penalty in Britain. Almost 50 years on, however, it is debatable whether the case really remains the uniquely virulent national obsession it once was.</p> <p>The more honest reality is that, with the passage of time and after the death of Hindley a decade ago, the Moors murders are finally passing inexorably below the collective horizon. The case would not receive so much attention any longer were it not for the efforts of a mutually dependent carousel linking the murderers, the media, the police, the victims' families and successive home secretaries to keep it in the spotlight \u2013 arguably to no public benefit.</p> <p>This week's claims that Brady, now 74 and permanently detained in a special hospital, may have identified <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/17/moors-murderer-ian-brady-grave\" title=\"\">the grave site of his last undiscovered victim</a>, Keith Bennett, follow a familiar pattern. A media organisation, in this case Channel 4's Cutting Edge documentary series, gets a sniff of <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/ian-brady-letter-to-winnie-johnson-revealed-in-channel-4-documentary\" title=\"\">a new Brady angle on the Moors story</a>, contacts the victims' families, gets the police involved, and starts the ball rolling again. As so often, the flurry of activity takes place shortly before another legal twist in the saga, in this case Brady's application to be transferred to a Scottish prison and be allowed to die, an event that may in turn tempt a new generation of headline-seeking ministers to blunder into the case.</p> <p>As often happens in Moors stories, the publicity means things have now got out of hand. Not for the first time, <a href=\"http://www.gmp.police.uk/mainsite/pages/B01E4F5B2D2AA96B80257A5D0029373A.htm\" title=\"\">Greater Manchester police have allowed the case's notoriety to go to their heads</a> and sway their judgment, by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/17/ian-brady-mental-health-advocate?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">arresting Brady's mental health advocate</a> under <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jul/18/rausing-charged-unusual-offence\" title=\"\">an inappropriate common law power</a>, interfering with her private communications with her client, and wrongly stating that they have a duty to investigate and implying they would dig for remains if useful information came to light. Inevitably, Keith's surviving relatives \u2013 his mother has died \u2013 have been disturbed by the whole affair.</p> <p>This is simply misguided and even cruel, especially so if the chain has been set in motion by Brady himself. There is no overriding public interest in continuing to pursue this long solved case, especially when one murderer is dead and the other is in prison for ever. The police simply have better things to do. The relatives need support in better ways.

  "<p>You are the president of a large country with a growing economy, intent on keeping your name up there in the lights. You pride yourself on your popularity, your sense of history, and the fact that you personify the destiny of your country (or so you keep telling yourself). A&#xa0;criminal court sentences three young women, two of them mothers, to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/17/pussy-riot-sentenced-two-years\" title=\"\">two years in prison</a> for staging a 40-second punk feminist stunt inside your country's official church and the world's social network sites go mad. Two years of gulag for Vladimir Putin's enemies, they scream. Demonstrations erupt on the streets outside your embassies. Ageing celebs queue patiently to condemn you. There is even someone offering knitting patterns for Pussy Riot's balaclavas. The punk feminist band becomes a global brand before it even releases its first album and you a pariah so sullen that not even botox conceals your scowls. Mr Putin did not so much shoot himself in the foot on Friday, as fire a Kalashnikov into his size 8s.</p> <p>Pussy Riot must have offended many Russian Orthodox believers by screaming lyrics such as \"Shit, shit, the Lord's shit\" behind the iconotasis of the Church of Christ the Saviour. An opinion poll released by the independent Levada research group found that only 6% of Russians polled sympathised with the women and 51% felt either indifference, irritation or hostility. Similar umbrage would have been taken inside St Paul's or the Vatican. And those who doubt that may well wonder what tension would have been caused by a flash-mob invading a mosque at Friday prayers.</p> <p>How many museums around the world would have looked the other way as a number of couples \u2013 including a heavily pregnant Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, one of the three convicted on Friday \u2013 were filmed having sex to illustrate how Muscovites were being screwed by their government? The British Museum? The&#xa0;Louvre? The Metropolitan? The wish to punish anarchists is not Russian alone.</p> <p>But the wish to crush political dissent, in this way and at this time, is Mr Putin's alone. Pussy Riot had two points to make, both of them valid: that the Orthodox Church provides intellectual and religious cover for Mr Putin's increasingly messianic political brand; and that this man is driving Russia straight up a cul de sac. The&#xa0;agent of stability is becoming the obstacle to change. The omens are not good. Mr Putin has no policies to offer a generation that has been politically awakened. He is not ready for dialogue with any part of country, and he is all about reinforcing central control. He has lost his grip on his popular image so he is forced back on an essentially conservative base. The&#xa0;result is that in his third term as president, Mr Putin has a real problem re-establishing himself as a leader for Russia as a whole.</p> <p>The Pussy Riot trial will not be the last. Criminal prosecutions will become the weapon of choice against political activists like the anti-corruption blogger Aleksei Navalny, journalists who face stiffer penalties for libel, websites, or foreign-funded NGOs. Of course the world reaction is selective and partial. Would that Sergei Magnitsky, the lawyer whose corruption investigation led to his death in prison, have produced the same reaction as the Pussy Riot verdict. That does not change the verdict that all Mr Putin has to offer the next demonstration, called for September, is a bigger stick.</p> <p>It need not be this way. Mr Putin still has time to climb out of the hole he has dug himself into. He could call early parliamentary elections, because it was the rigged Duma elections last year that triggered the current crisis. He could let a popularly elected prime minister run the country. He could retreat from the political frontline, and still fashion a role for himself as father of the nation. To continue as he is doing, as the only and increasingly unsteady hand on Russia's tiller, spells disaster.</p>",
  "<p>It was called Treasure Island in honour of Robert Louis Stevenson's pirate classic, but the artificial island off San Francisco bay has nothing but trouble buried in its soil: radioactive contamination left by the US navy.</p> <p>Internal documents and emails from the navy and public health officials reveal that the contamination, a legacy of ships exposed to atomic blasts and radiation training during the cold war, is more widespread than previously thought.</p> <p>The navy reportedly bungled a clean-up, leaving topsoil with 400 times the Environmental Protection Agency's human exposure limits.</p> <p>The revelations have alarmed some of the island's 2,800 residents and cast a shadow over plans to start building high-rise apartments for 20,000 more people next year.</p> <p>The documents were <a href=\"http://www.baycitizen.org/environment/story/radiation-history-treasure-island-more/\">disclosed by the Bay Citizen</a>, a nonprofit news organisation covering the bay area. \"The large volume of radiological contaminated material, high number of radioactive commodities [individual items or sources], and high levels of radioactive contamination \u2026 have raised concerns ... regarding the nature and extent of the radiological contamination present at Treasure Island,\" Stephen Woods, an environmental clean-up manager for the public health department, wrote in a 2011 email.</p> <p>A burgeoning file of radiation discoveries, Woods said, undermined the navy's continued use of a 2006 report as a basis for claims that some parcels were clear of radiation and ready for housing development.</p> <p>The navy and a separate state regulatory agency, the Department of Toxic Substances Control, said California's public health officials were wrong and that there was no health risk.</p> <p>Treasure Island, spanning 535 acres, was created by the federal government from landfill in 1937. It was named in honour of Louis Stevenson's book because he lived in San Francisco from 1879 to 1880. It hosted the 1939-40 Golden Gate International Exposition before being handed to the navy.</p> <p>The island used the base to repair and salvage vessels exposed to atomic blasts during the 1940s and 1950s. Cannon sights contained radioactive glow-in-the-dark material. A training ship, the USS Pandemonium, was intentionally doused in radiation so sailors could practise scrubbing it. The navy had a radiological \"counting room\" to test personnel and equipment for contamination.</p> <p>In 1993 the navy agreed to hand the island back to the city for $105m, a deal which required inspection and approval from state health officials.</p> <p>Naval operations ended there in 1997 and in a 2006 report the navy gave a clean bill of health to affected sites, saying 170 acres were suitable to transfer to San Francisco, paving the way for ambitious plans to create a new neighbourhood.</p> <p>The island found a new lease of life as a set for films including Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Flubber, Patch Adams, Bicentennial Man and The Caine Mutiny. Some visual effects from The Matrix were also filmed there.</p> <p>However in recent reports and emails state health officials faulted the navy's 2006 report. They noted that contractors removed 16,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil, some with radiation levels 400 times the EPA's human exposure limits. Residents on the island are required to grow plants in above-ground pots to avoid soil-borne chemicals.</p> <p>Emily Rapaport, president of Good Neighbors of Treasure Island and Yerba Buena Island, who has lived on the island for a decade, said residents were not fully informed about contamination. \"They should have been more open and upfront, because there would have been people who would have chosen not to live here,\" she told the Bay Citizen.</p> <p>In a May memo to the Department of Toxic Substances Control Woods, the state environmental cleanup manager, accused the navy of rushing its evaluation of Treasure Island's radioactive legacy.</p> <p>It had delayed releasing sample data to state health inspectors and failed to test for radioactive soil at sites where it had found toxic chemical waste, he wrote. As of May, he noted, contractors had transported 1,000 truckloads of radioactive waste off the island with more still in the ground.</p> <p>The Department of Toxic Substances Control, however, said there was no risk to health, a version echoed by the navy's environmental cleanup co-ordinator, James Sullivan, who said concerns were exaggerated and inconsistent with the navy's commitment to safety.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 August 2012.

  "<p>\"Who will buy this wonderful morning? Such a sky you never did see! Who will tie it up with a ribbon and put it in a box for me?\" The answer, <a href=\"http://artists.letssingit.com/oliver-lyrics-who-will-buy-rxlxq6l\" title=\"\">dear Oliver</a>, is no one. At least, I hope not. Wonderful mornings are not to be possessed. They&#xa0;are not to be had. To own a wonderful morning would be to destroy it. That is part of the quality that makes them wonderful.</p> <p>Recently <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/r4sf\" title=\"\">on BBC Radio 4's Stephanomics programme</a>, the economist Patrick Minford, argued we ought to extend markets to cover air. Shocking, I know. Take a deep breath. It's still free. But given the omnivorous desire of some economists to subsume absolutely everything within their purview, maybe we can't take that for granted. If&#xa0;people can sell you expensive bottled water that dropped freely from the sky, one day they'll be flogging you air like in Sesame Street: \"I got something you need and I can sell it to you real cheap, it's real important,\" says Bert to Ernie. He goes on to sell him a whole bottle of air for a nickel. And Ernie thinks he has a bargain.</p> <p>The argument for this madness is as follows: the trouble with markets as currently conceived is that they don't show up the full costs of industry upon the environment. So what is needed is to extend markets to cover the commons: trees, rivers, air, and so on. Anything scarce needs to be subject to a price mechanism so that limited resources can be managed by preference and choice. In other words, the trouble with capitalism is that we don't have enough of it. Sure, if big companies are using the environment as a free dustbin they ought to pay for it.</p> <p>The question is how. The right way is through taxation. But for others, following the Nobel prize-winning economist Ronald Coase, it is by privatising the commons, thus creating a market in so-called externalities.</p> <p>Fortunately, this argument isn't going anywhere politically. Most of us instinctively get that the commons cannot be owned by any one person or corporation. That why we call them commons. \"Property is theft,\" said Proudhon. Some things are simply and rightly unownable. But I want to extend this: property is also death. For some things are killed by ownership. Consider how love can too easily include an element of the desire to possess. Yet to posses another is to destroy their otherness, which in turn destroys the very thing being loved. You can't tie others up with a ribbon and put them in a box.</p> <p>And here I quickly come over all religious. The point is that God can never be collapsed into human desire or quantification \u2013 thus never bought, sold or intellectually had. Being a believer is not to be in possession of one big theory of everything but rather to accept an existential version of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem \u2013 that not everything can be gobbled up in one sort of explanation \u2013 scientific, economic or indeed religious. There is always a remainder. God is beyond commodification. Most important things are: the people we love, the beautiful morning.</p> <p>Which is why the Hebrew scriptures are constantly worried by idolatry and the Marxists by reification. Both are dangerous processes through which we turn the things we love into objects of ownership and control. Thus we kill&#xa0;them.</p> <p>All this is really a circuitous reflection on what is a stonkingly beautiful day. Some things are just there and are wonderful. Oliver is right to want to sing about them. But they cannot be owned. The market is big enough already.</p>",

This was described as \"an absolutely intimidating and unprecedented use of police\" designed to show the British government's desire to \"go in with a strong hand\".</p> <p>However, the source said that Quito had been encouraged by a phone call made by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to the Ecuadorean ambassador on Thursday. \"The FCO called the ambassador yesterday to confirm that it still had the will to talk and negotiate, so we'll keep talking,\" it added.</p> <p>\"The fact that they called the ambassador makes us think that the letter with the threat of using domestic legislation to make an incursion into the embassy and arrest somebody inside was a mistake \u2013 as was the intimidating increase in the number of police surrounding the embassy on the same day the letter was delivered.\"</p> <p>It stressed that Ecuador was willing to co-operate with the British and Swedish authorities over the matter of Assange's extradition to Sweden. \"In the negotiations with the FCO, Ecuador has been proposing that we would be prepared to accept an undertaking from the UK and Sweden that, once Julian Assange has faced the Swedish investigation, he will not be extradited to a third country: specifically the US. That might be a way out of it and Ecuador has always said it does not want to interfere with the Swedish judicial process; we could facilitate it.\"</p> <p>The source said the Ecuadorean government had been bolstered by the support it had received since deciding to grant asylum to Assange, adding: \"We are moved by the overwhelming level of solidarity that Ecuador now has in the [Latin American] region.\"</p> <p>Asked how Assange was coping with the pressure of life in the small embassy, where he has been living for 55 days, the source said: \"He's fine. He's not stressed out. Given the fact that he has been under pressure for so long and that his legal fight has gone through so many different levels, I think that for his safety he always had a last resort.\"</p> <p>Scotland Yard declined to comment on the policing operation at the embassy, while an FCO source said the letter sent to the Ecuadorean authorities on Wednesday was not menacing and that the rights of the country's officials would continue to be respected by the government.</p> <p>\"The letter was not a threat,\" said the source. \"There had already been many meetings with the Ecuador government. It was just that it was quite clear that they were close to making a decision and we wanted them to know the law. It was merely signposting the fact.\"</p> <p>The foreign secretary, William Hague, was informed about diplomatic developments on the Assange case, although a spokeswoman declined to divulge further details, saying: \"We are not providing a running commentary.\"</p> <p>At a press conference on Wednesday, Ecuador's foreign minister, Ricardo Pati\u00f1o, released details of the contentious letter, which he said was delivered through a British embassy official in Quito.</p> <p>The letter said: \"You need to be aware that there is a legal base in the UK, the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987, that would allow us to take actions in order to arrest Mr Assange in the current premises of the embassy.\" It added: \"We need to reiterate that we consider the continued use of the diplomatic premises in this way incompatible with the Vienna convention and unsustainable and we have made clear the serious implications that this has for our diplomatic relations.\"</p> <p>Pati\u00f1o said that Ecuador rejected the \"explicit threat\" made in the letter, adding: \"This is unbecoming of a democratic, civilised and law-abiding state. If this conduct persists, Ecuador will take appropriate responses in accordance with international law. If the measures announced in the British official communication materialise they will be interpreted by Ecuador as a hostile and intolerable act and also as an attack on our sovereignty, which would require us to respond with greater diplomatic force.\"</p> <p>Hague has denied suggestions that the FCO was threatening \"to storm an embassy\", saying: \"We are talking about an act of parliament in this country which stresses that it must be used in full conformity with international law.\"</p> <p>He has also said that Assange will not be allowed safe passage out of the UK despite the asylum decision, and that diplomatic immunity should not be used to harbour alleged criminals.</p> <p>It is unclear whether Assange will address his supporters at the embassy on Sunday, as has been reported. He has described the granting of political asylum by Ecuador as a \"significant and historic victory\".</p>",
  "<p>There's a reason it's called a punchline. At the <a href=\"http://www.edfringe.com/\">Edinburgh comedy festival</a> there are rape jokes and domestic violence jokes bouncing through the town. It is strange why comedy, theoretically so revolutionary, should embrace the bloodiest kind of social reaction, but it is so.</p> <p>I watched a young, gangly comic called Chris Turner position himself as a nerd, boast he went to Oxford University, and tell jokes about Roman numerals. Then it came: \"I was waiting for my girlfriend to come round. Because I'd hit her really hard.\" Afterwards I asked him \u2013 why tell jokes about domestic violence? \"Because it's funny,\" he said. \"It's funny enough.\" Then he said he has studied feminism. So this is a culture that mocks the degradation of women; it is, as they say, only material and sometimes promotion. There is a show called Sex Tourist by Chris Dangerfield, which has a flyer you can take to an escort agency for \u00a310 off.</p> <p>Misogyny is a constant in standup, and has been for 20 years, since the feminist revolution began to crawl away&#xa0;from mainstream culture, to be shagged by <a href=\"http://www.loaded.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Loaded</a>. A comic called Gerry K tells a joke about watching a pimp fighting with two prostitutes. \"I'm&#xa0;not having that,\" he says, \"So I joined in.\" Here comes the reveal \u2013 \"I&#xa0;punched her spark out.\" A comic called Paul Revill says: \"Some audiences say they don't like rape jokes. They say that, but I know what they mean.\"</p> <p>All this normalises and diminishes violence towards women: if it is easy to&#xa0;laugh about, it is hard to take seriously. There is an obvious connection between misogynist discourse and violence because, as <a href=\"http://www.maureenyounger.co.uk/Laughing_Cows.html\" title=\"\">Maureen Younger of Laughing Cows</a> says, \"Women are always the butt of these jokes. It's never the perpetrator\". In these gaudy rooms, the indifference amazes.</p> <p>It is most common on the open mic circuit where young comedians play for nothing and you can, if you wish, hear 20 comedians telling 20 rape jokes in one night. The comic Nick Page says: \"It is getting worse because of the volume of people trying to enter the comedy industry without the life experience to create good jokes and good stories.\" Page was due to appear at an Edinburgh showcase last week, but he left after watching \"three comics in a row doing rape or violence material. They were damaging comedy. But with the death of feminism in mainstream culture more and more people are prepared to put up with it.\"</p> <p>It's true; even comedians that don't do misogynist material are protective of those that do, because they are wary of censorship and contemptuous of hecklers. When <a href=\"http://danieltosh.com/\" title=\"\">Daniel Tosh</a> was told by a female punter that \"rape jokes are never funny\" he asked the audience, \"Wouldn't it be funny if that girl got raped by, like, five guys right now? Like&#xa0;right now? What if a bunch of guys just raped her \u2026\" Other comics defended him and the promoter said: \"You start dishing out something to a&#xa0;comic and try to be funny, you better&#xa0;be able to take it.\"</p> <p>The comedian Sarah Bennetto told a story earlier this year about a comic she heard in one of the \"horrible open mic hate filled rooms.\" The nameless man is the \"perennial open mic act \u2013 frustrated and angry at the world, he blames women, minorities, everything for his lack of success\". He was talking about how his female friend cried on his shoulder and so, he says, \"I fucked her in the arse. I thought I'd really give her something to cry on my shoulder about.\" Then he said he might \"slit her throat from behind, dig a hole in my back garden and bury her\". This is not comedy, of course, but rage disguised as comedy. When the comic heard about Bennetto's anger he threatened her online, which is quite odd. She could have reasonably used the \"irony\" defence. I sort of wish she had. It would have been ironic.</p> <p>But this is not a childish tic of the beginner. Famous comics do it and it makes them rich. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/jimmy-carr\" title=\"\">Jimmy Carr</a> has many rape jokes: \"What do nine out of 10 people enjoy? Gang rape.\" What is rape&#xa0;anyway, he asks, but \"surprise sex\"? Russell Brand has called the police&#xa0;from the stage to say he had spotted a sex attacker. This giggling over sexual assault leaks all over Brand; according to the Sun, a few weeks ago, he held up shooting on a film set for two hours until the wardrobe girl showed him her breasts, and he should have been fired. Unfortunately, the only disciplinary action was from his co-star Billy Connolly.</p> <p>Spiky Mike, who runs the comedy promoter Funhouse, says, \"the comedians at the lower end of the scale&#xa0;follow what is in vogue at the top end. They see Jimmy Carr and Frankie Boyle doing extremely offensive material, try to copy it and do it badly, which is even more offensive\".</p> <p>I am not sure that a lucrative career in rape gags is more helpful than a failed one, but the rape hum seems eternal. And why not? As the US comedian <a href=\"http://sarahsilvermanonline.com/\" title=\"\">Sarah Silverman</a> says: \"Who is going to complain about rape jokes? Rape victims? They barely even report rape.\"</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TanyaGold1\" title=\"\"><em>@TanyaGold1</em></a></p> <p>\u2022 This article was updated on 18 August to clarify that information about Brand holding up shooting was reported by the Sun newspaper.</p>",
  "<p>On Thursday afternoon, the atmosphere outside the Ecuadorean embassy was vibrant. Inside was Julian Assange, granted asylum by President Rafael Correa, presumably doing whatever it is he's been doing since he sought refuge there in June.</p> <p>An anonymous supporter said: \"He's got his computer, so he's bound to be all right.\" For the embassy staff, it must be like having a teenage stepson, the price of a much desired union but maybe a bit of a pain in the neck. But the critical question now is not how to live with him, but how to arrange it so they can go back to living without him.</p> <p>Assange cannot stay indefinitely in the embassy, and can't be bundled into a car, but he could, said Farhan, 42, \"be put into a crate, and taken to an airport. You can't open diplomatic luggage\". Farhan had come as a \"legal watcher\", so that, if the British government does intend to breach article 31 of the Vienna Convention (which states that a host country can't enter consular premises), at least people will be watching.</p> <p>Phil, 29, another legal watcher, said: \"What's the health and safety angle on that? You could give him airholes, I suppose.\" Alex Cole, a bystander, said: \"It's like Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, he only exists for as long as you're not allowed to check he's in there.\"</p> <p>Kris, a friend of Farhan's, was arguing with Sophie Harman, 31, a doctor of international politics, with a variety of fields of expertise, including feminist political economy; at one point, he left and returned with some Starbursts.</p> <p>On social media, the Assange case has become a cantankerous troll-fest, with one side vaunting that anybody with any anxiety at all about the possibility that Assange will be extradited from Sweden to the US must therefore be pro-rape, while the other side maintains the alleged rape victims must be lying, because the US is evil.</p> <p>People who can be bothered to turn up outside an embassy have a different approach, one in which they talk to each rather than try to shut each other down.</p> <p>Shaun, 47, believes Assange would be in \"very grave danger\" if he went willingly to Sweden, but Harman counters: \"I don't know why Sweden would unilaterally try to build this relationship with the US.\" She continued: \"The way that sexual violence is treated in international relations is despicable. In DRC [Democratic Republic of Congo], rape is an act of war. Here, it's a conspiracy against Assange.</p> <p>\"With Dominique Strauss-Kahn, he was just a bit iffy. It's always the case with rape charges that the women are dismissed.\"</p> <p>There were supporters of Assange who wouldn't talk to the Guardian, because of the paper's poor relationship with the WikiLeaks founder. \"It's written by toads\", one woman told me. \"Not you,\" she amended politely. \"I don't know what you write about.\"</p> <p>In general, it was discursive, heated, friendly, and alive. The police were 50-50, some cheerful, some issuing instructions with that insufferable jobsworthy passive sentence structure: \"I need you to be making it safe for others to use the pavement.\" It's possible they were playing good cop/bad cop.</p> <p>On Friday morning, the standoff continued but the crowds had dissipated: or rather, the crowds of media, who'd always made up the majority, were still there, all in their professional semi-circles round a neat, groomed presenter, occasionally scowled at by a shopper in difficult shoes trying to get to Harrods.</p> <p>Telesur and TeleAmazonas led the interest but the Beeb was there as well. Two drunks and someone (who wanted to be nameless) from Occupy were the only others, by mid-morning. He said: \"I think there's a massive protest outside the Russian embassy about Pussy Riot. So everyone's gone there.\"</p> <p>He smiled, as if to say: \"What are we waiting for?\" Certainly, anyone waiting for Assange's case to go one way or the other could be here for some time.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> Morning everyone. Yesterday, Geoffrey Boycott said on Test Match Special, was a lovely day's Test cricket, not a great one but a nice one. Nice one. It certainly ebbed and flowed, rumbled along for spells before sparking and England had their share of good fortune with the dismissals of Petersen and Kallis, and their share of Jimmy Anderson bowling jaffas which marginally beat the bat. That fiftysomething partnership between Philander and Duminy put South Africa almost equal in the spoils I would say and there have been a <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;opposition=1;orderby=fow_score;partnership_wicketmin1=5;partnership_wicketval1=partnership_wicket;qualmax1=400;qualmin1=50;qualval1=fow_score;spanmin1=15+Mar+2000;spanval1=span;team=3;template=results;type=fow;view=innings\">fair few 50+ ones from the Saffers' lower order</a> over the past 12 years. There has been quite a lot of analysis devoted to Stuart Broad's lack of ratpower throughout this series, though there were signs at Headingley that he was getting back towards one of his hot streaks, signs that were absent yesterday as he focused on swing. He did get some but it tended to come floaty and early, from the hand, rather than the late stuff that Anderson effects. Finn's ball to bag Amla was a peach and, though he has that wicket-taking knack, needs more vim in this session. <br><strong><br>A special guest will ring the bell for the start of play at Lord's today</strong>. It's still not Piers Morgan. It's not Russell Brand on top of a No13 bus \"singing\" Hey Bulldog. It's Olympic gold medallist shooter Peter Wilson, who took to the gun when his schoolboy cricket career was ended by injury.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Lord's jinx:</strong> Cricinfo's S Rajesh has been <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/577703.html\">looking at the failure of certain batsmen at Lord's</a>, inspired by Jacques Kallis's dismissal. It's an interesting list (third table on the page) \u2013 Javed Miandad averaged 12.50, Ricky Ponting 18.16, Brian Lara 21.00 and Sachin Tendulkar 21.67. They can't have been overawed so what is it, (odd umpiring decisions apart). The slope?</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>88th over: South Africa 262-7 (Philander 46, Steyn 21)</strong> Two balls left in Steve Finn's over. England have their huddle. There was a lot of conspicuous low-fiving and buttock-tapping among them yesterday, the body language analysts in their medicine show style with the obvious judgment that they are trying to emphasise how united they are as a team. Message to KP!. Finn's last two balls are short of a length and seen out by Steyn.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>89th over: South Africa 263-7 (Philander 47, Steyn 21)</strong> Duncan Bonnett asks for a weather report. Overcast and humid now, Duncan, spirit of 76 cloudless sky and sunshine this afternoon. Anderson takes this end, Philander deflecting it off his pads for a single. Jimmy greets his great mate Steyn with a bouncer, that flies over the top of his helmet badge then has him fending the next one off his shoulder that cracks into his left glove, trapping it on the handle. He shakes it and tells the physio who had already uncapped his spray to do one and stay off the field. Anderson calls up a short leg and slides two across, a la Finn, for the keeper's leg-side catch but Steyn misses them both.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>90th over: South Africa 268-7 (Philander 48, Steyn 25)</strong> \"Morning Bagchi, morning everybody,\" writes Josh Robinson in traditional style. \"I didn't see a great deal of yesterday's play, concentrating as I was on <strike> emailing Smy </strike> the demands of my job, but is it possible that the England players' conduct was not so much trying to emphasise how united they are as a team as reflecting a greater sense of unity? Or did they look as if they were trying too hard to make a point?\" It did look calculated to me, and Shaun Pollock was giggling away on TMS with his scenario of how they would have reacted had KP made the sort of stops that elicited ar$e taps for Jonny Bairstow. Broad takes over from Finn, Philander takes one after a short delay while Steyn had his ring finger sprayed. Big swing from Broad, hooping away to second slip. Steyn watches one go by then has a big drive at the next that flies between third slip and gully for four.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>91st over: South Africa 270-7 (Philander 49, Steyn 26)</strong> Anderson is trying to tempt Big Vern into an expansive drive to get to 50 with his first two balls then a shorter one, arrowing into him, which he knocks down to midwicket for a single. Steyn then tips and runs into the covers. \"You continue to mention Piers Morgan in your preamble. Can I remind you of I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue's redefinition of common words in The Uxbridge English Dictionary: Countryside (n) : Killing Piers Morgan.\" Stephen Fry, I believe. I also liked Jihad - the cry of a fundamentalist cowboy.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Wicket!! Steyn c Swann b Broad 26</strong> Broad pitches up outside off stump, a hint of away swing and Steyn can't resist a drive, nicking off to second slip where Swann pouches it thigh high.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>92nd over: South Africa 271-8 (Philander 49, Morkel 1)</strong> Broad's pace is between 78 and 82 mph, throttling back and laying the trap for the tailenders on the drive. It worked well for Steyn, who tried to be a good citizen then couldn't help himself. Morkel's single off the last ball puts him on strike for Anderson.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>93rd over: South Africa 275-8 (Philander 49, Morkel 5)</strong> Morkel cuts a ball angled across him and plays it like a bona fide batsman, smearing it into the ground and through third man for four. The sado-masochism of Duncan Haskell might be the other way round judging by his dispatch from the tub: \"It feels like this series has readdressed the pleasure/ pain balance that so many of us associate with English cricket. With four days still to play out it's impossible to know what feeling we'll be left with and that's what makes it so exciting. I'm glad it's like this, I first need to suffer to be able to enjoy the thrill - like when I have a bath and leave the hot tap dripping molten tears on to my big toe, that searing pain makes the comfort the rest of my body is experiencing all the more gratifying. Have I shared too much?\" Frankly, yes. Anderson bangs it into Morkel, getting him up on his toes but he rides the bounce and plays it competently down to drop in front of gully.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>94th over: South Africa 276-8 (Philander 50, Morkel 5)</strong> Philander brings up his 50 by hooking to long leg for a single. Broad now has Morkel to have a dart at for four balls, and with the batsman's lack of footwork aims to pin him lbw with inswingers. He clips the pads twice but both are headed down the leg side.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>95th over: South Africa 281-8 (Philander 55, Morkel 5)</strong> Philander, by contrast with Morkel, is positively Gene Kelly, stepping across and forward to a half volley and spanking Anderson through mid-off for four. Anderson nips the next one into him but he blocks it with bat and pad then has a blacksmith's heave, missing the overpitched delivery outside off, and almost hits himself on the top of his helmet with his bat. A real \"wahay\" shot, provoking laughter from Mike Atherton and some of the crowd.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>96th over: South Africa 281-8 (Philander 57, Morkel 9)</strong> More short stuff from Broad smacks into Morkel's glove in front of his chin. \"As we prepare for my son Noah's first days at our local primary,\" asks my friend Peter Lovell. \"I was wondering whether your readers have an opinion on how many state school England batsmen there might be between now and his own England debut in 2030?\" Let's get burrowing and extrapolating.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>97th over: South Africa 292-8 (Philander 58, Morkel 13)</strong> Morkel heaves, connects and takes four off Anderson through the gap between gully and third slip that leaves Jimmy gurning . It's obviously a deliberate strategy to target Morkel and Steyn with some sternum rattlers to then set them up for the edge when they pitch up. The last ball of the Anderson's over was a case in point, bowled from round the wicket and swinging in but Morkel stops his drive mid swing and digs it out.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>98th over: South Africa 295-8 (Philander 59, Morkel 15)</strong> Swann with his George Orwell haircut comes on and bowls a pair of beauties to Morkel, drifting in and spinning away that the left-hander tries to play on the back foot and almost becomes unstuck. \"As Claire Rayner no longer answers questions (Ouija enthusiasts excepted),\" writes Phil Withall. \"I was wondering if you could help. My natural default setting is to \"pray for rain\" obviously this is not going to maintain the number 1 spot for England. Should I now start praying for Fifa to take over cricket's ranking system thus elevating the England side back to the top?\" Lies, damn lies and Fifa's rankings. I once spent a day working out how it worked (for a piece), tried to apply the figures and came up with a different permutation entirely. Common sense was the least consideration.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>99th over: South Africa 298-8 (Philander 59, Morkel 18)</strong> Anderson has to be due some luck. He has bowled at least five unplayables this morning, all \"wasted on thee\", and has taken to sarcastically clapping when the batsman connects with the next. \"Has your bat got a hole in it grandad?\" Angus Fraser once asked Geoff Boycott during one such similar spell. \"If you're so good, bowl at stoomps\" was Geoff's cleaned up response.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>100th over: South Africa 301-8 (Philander 59, Morkel 21)</strong> Morkel brings up the 300 off Swann with a shovel drive. \"I hate it when England do this,\" writes Steven Pye. \"They draw us in by taking early wickets, and then comes the inevitable lower order resistance. You'd think I would be used to it by now. This match is already reminding me of yet another <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64041.html\">South Africa recovery at Headingley in 2003</a>.\" Zondeki and Kirsten. Aagh. Thanks for reminding me. That's when I went grey.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Morkel c Prior b Finn 25</strong> Excellent catch by Prior, his fifth of the innings, as the ball flew off the bottom of Morkel's bat when he was trying to boom a cut shot over the top of slips.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>101st over: South Africa 309-9 (Philander 61, Tahir 2)</strong> Morkel took four with a tickle down the legside when Finn came back into the attack but succumbed to a buffet long hop. He's got the knack. \"I have never got this use of 'oo' as a 'Northern Vernacular',\" writes Phil Tyrer. \"To me, if you write 'stoomps' as per the Boycott quote, that sounds wrong, like hoop or loom \u2026 Surely 'stumps' is correct, unless you're trying not to be a Landahner, and saying 'stamps'.\" I was copying Simon Hughes's transcription from A Lot of Hard Yakka. He's from Ealing, Geoffrey's from Fitzwilliam.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Philander st Prior b Swann 61</strong> Glorious flight from Swann, lured Philander down the track. He went down on one knee to drive but the ball dipped perfectly, beat the bat and Prior whipped off the stumps with Philander three feet short. <strong>South Africa all out for 309</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>Some inter-innings emails:</strong> \"All hands?\" writes Tony George. \"Glad you mentioned Zondeki. Always makes me smile as it can't be only me that think he had possibly the greatest nickname ever?\" Josh \"I hate you Henry Higgins\" Robinson points out: \"Phil Tyrer needs to realise that it's not stoomps as in hoop or loom, but stoomps as in look, as opposed to Luke, unless you're from Merseyside.\" Anyway. Here come Strauss and Cook.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>1st over: England 1-0 (Strauss 1, Cook 0) South Africa 309 </strong> Morkel takes the new ball from the Nursery End and Strauss tickles him round the corner to get off the mark first ball. Morkel follows up with beautiful ball jagging away from Cook. He's bowling from the wrong end to the left-handers, says Sir Beef. Tim \"Col Pickering\" Sanders has more on the north-south divide: \"Writing 'stoomps' for 'stumps' is a handy way for southerners to represent the pronounciation of \"u\" anywhere north of (roughly) Leamington Spa (I read in Stuart Maconie's book Pies and Prejudice that this is geographically where the change in vowel pronounciation happens). It sort of works because of the way that both southerners and Yorkshire folk pronounce words like 'book' and 'look'. Lancastrians confuse things by their consistency in pronouncing the 'oo' in 'book' and 'look' the same as in 'moon' and 'soon'. That makes 'stoomps' sound pretty silly.\" There you go.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>2nd over: England 14-0 (Strauss 8, Cook 6) South Africa 309 </strong> Strauss makes hay off the first ball of Philander's over, clipping him up the hill off his pads for four then driving him uppishly with a hint of slice through cover for three. Good, confident start from Strauss this. Several of you have pointed out that we haven't mentioned the follow-on target. We're not going to be so English today but perhaps I ought to as Philander gets Cook to edge, thankfully down through second slip's legs for four then takes two more with a genuine pushed drive. The sun's out.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>3rd over: England 16-0 (Strauss 10, Cook 6) South Africa 309 </strong> South Africa have a man in catching behind square at about two o'clock, six yards from the bat and Strauss duly plays one down to him. The heavy roller has done its job, Morkel pitching short and Strauss ducking and swaying out of the way but if he'd stood up it would have been nipple high. Morkel fell over in his follow-through, having trouble with the slope and afraid of a warning for running on the pitch.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>4th over: England 16-0 (Strauss 10, Cook 6) South Africa 309 </strong> Philander's line is all over the place, squirting a couple across Cook towards first slip that he went for but couldn't reach. \"At the start of this innings, I am watching the Saffer opening bowlers limber up, and it just feels like the series long personal battles that should develop are not going to mature,\" writes Hugh Maguire. \"It's like eating a young cheese, a nice texture, but no flavour to linger on and yearn for again. It's not as if we've not waited in anticipation for this series for long enough for a tasty match-up.\" I was sitting in the public library on Thurmon Street just now, skimming through Rogue Herries by Hugh Walpole, and I suddenly came over all peckish.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>5th over: England 21-0 (Strauss 15, Cook 6) South Africa 309 </strong> Strauss plays a fine shot off Morkel's second ball, leaning forward and clipping him through midwicket for four off the front foot but Morkel responds with another diamond, pitching on the ideal length and fizzing away from the left-hander's bat. That was Andersonesque. Speaking of which, Rupert in Cape Town writes: \"Any mention of Anderson bad luck needs to be tempered with Steyn's scant fortunes on the last day of the Newlands test between these sides. I was fortunate enough to be there seeing Dale eviscerate Collingwood for what seemed to be hours on end.\" Yes, what a spell to Collingwood and Onions, too, I think. This isn't of that standard, a pretty loose opening from Philander and Morkel.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>6th over: England 23-0 (Strauss 15, Cook 6) South Africa 309 </strong> Philander continues with his over-the wicket line across Strauss but after the roller his slips are perhaps two steps too deep. He bowls four in the perfect spot then drifts on to leg stump and Strauss takes a couple of leg-byes off his thigh pad.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>7th over: England 24-0 (Strauss 15, Cook 6) South Africa 309 </strong> Edward Matkin takes up the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3KBuQHHKx0\">cheese shop challenge</a>. Now Morkel has hit his straps, getting some inswing and movement away off the pitch, Cook edging on to his front pad, killing both the chance of lbw and the ball on its flight through to the slips. \"I've no light to shed on the whys and wherefores, \" writes Rachael Jack, \"But I was living out in Pakistan during the 2007 T20 World Cup when Bumble developed a mini fan club with the sisters in the place I was staying purely based on his pronunciation of loonch.\" Bumble needs no whys and wherefores.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>8th over: England 24-0 (Strauss 16, Cook 6) South Africa 309 </strong> Michael Holding suggests that Morne Morkel has Strauss fever. He goes wild at the sight of him and becomes too aggressive, losing control. He points out that Morkel has taken his wicket seven times but feels Steyn should take the new ball.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>9th over: England 28-0 (Strauss 19, Cook 6) South Africa 309 </strong> Graeme Smith ponders using DRS when Morkel clips Strauss's thigh pad on its way through to De Villiers but decides against it. \"Luck plays its part in cricket as it does in life, but bowlers who are described as unlucky usually haven't bowled enough balls at the stumps,\" opines Gary Naylor. \"Not the least of Swanny's advantages over Monty, is that Swanny is at the stumps most of the time \u2013 as is Steyn, but not Philander (wide) nor Morkel (high).\" Good over from Morkel until the last ball, which is overpitched and turned by Strauss off his toes. They started haphazardly Philander and Morkel but have found their control and targeted Strauss's ribs and his outside edge in the past four overs.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>10th over: England 29-0 (Strauss 20, Cook 6) South Africa 309 </strong> Steyn takes over from Philander, for one over before lunch. Strauss plays his second with soft hands, steering the ball off the face of the bat to bounce in front of slip. Steyn seems to be carrying a knee injury, doing a one-leg jig after jarring it in his followthrough when Strauss pulls him round the corner for a single to long leg.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Strauss b Morkel 20</strong> Another pearl to follow the early dross from Morkel, pitched on off or an inch outside and cut back in through the gate to knock over off and middle. Bon appetit, Andrew Strauss.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>Lunch: </strong> South Africa took a while to warm up but the last five overs contained several snorters and jaggers. Strauss looked increasingly uncomfortable. <strong>England lunch on 29-1</strong>, 280 behind. I'm off for some food but I'll leave you with this rant from Ben Sponviken:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Having just read your over 88 description of contrived English body language I'm going to allow myself a rant. The tyrannical rule of sports psychologists must be ended. This spurious discipline should be limited to two simple goals: encouraging mental disintegration in your opponent and preventing mental disintegration in your own team. Postive 'body language' results from good cricket. It does not produce good cricket. Anyone who thinks, for example, that Warne was the intended audience of all that behind the stumps encouragement from Healy et al is an idiot. It all happens to make the batsman believe he's facing spin bowling that is so good he can't even appreciate it. KP should be out there today and no amount of ar$e patting is going to produce an innings of the sort of quality he was capable of. Strauss should have stared down the team and the media with simple maxim that he may be a ba$tard, but he's our ba$tard. Sorry.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>Lunchtime correspondence</strong>: \"A key gift in life is knowing when to make one's exit, \" writes James Debens. \"I hope the three-year eulogising of Strauss has given him the perspicacity to realise that he's a drag on the team he obviously loves. Do right by England, chum, and do one.\" It's another nothing score, James, but the fundamental difference between him, Vaughan, Hussain and Atherton is that I don't think he feels he's come to an end, the pressures of captaincy have not ultimately overwhelmed him and I think the selectors, coach and players want him to stay, which is what he wants. I think they'll give him the tour to India, hoping for a renaissance like Hussain's v Sri Lanka in 2000-01. </p> <p>\"Time for some dreamy minded, lunchtime nostalgia,\" notes Elliott Carr-Barnlsey. \"Looking at that scorecard from 2003, its nice to see the names Trescothick and Vaughan at the top of the order. Such different approaches but always capable of running amok. The leaden footed square clump of Banger's, and the most smooth cover drive from Vaughan. The best exponent of his generation. Looked like it'd been crafted by Ang Lee and rubbed over with baby oil.\" Wet dreamy minded? </p> <p>David White addresses the issue of luck in more concise fashion than Ed Smith: \"Interesting points about bowlers' luck. Seems to me that over the longer term it's less about luck and more about how they bowl. Andrew Flintoff didn't get nearly as many wickets over his career as he might have had he pitched the ball a foot further up the track. For all his potential, I would say the same applies to Stuart Broad. All to often he's 'bowling beautifully' without getting wickets. I seem to recall Beefy bowled some absolute trash at times but at least he was always trying something and the variation brought about batsman errors \u2013 maybe Finn's coming into the same category.\" Botham made the point himself, saying when Finn bagged Morkel, \"sometimes there's nothing more dangerous than a wide long hop\".</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>11th over: England 29-1 (Trott 0, Cook 6) South Africa 309 </strong> Two balls left in Morkel's over after a lunch for the players of cauliflower soup, barbecue pork, beef stir fry or sweet and sour red snapper, according to the menu. Trott takes guard after Morkel took Strauss's wicket for the eighth time. Big knock this for Trott, who watches the two balls sail past off stump.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>12th over: England 34-1 (Trott 4, Cook 7) South Africa 309 </strong> Steyn resumes and immediately brings the first delivery back into Cook while the second holds its line towards the keeper. Cook lets both of them go past. Interesting comparison on Sky between the dismissals of Amla and Strauss, both pinned on the crease by lifters then groping with only a half-step forward and missing when it's pitched up. Trott's off the mark with his favourite shot, punched off his hip for four and would hsve had a second with his on-drive but for Morkel's chain-sawed Sequoia dive at mid-on.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>13th over: England 34-1 (Trott 4, Cook 7) South Africa 309 </strong> Philander replaces Morkel up the hill and shouts for leg-before. Looks way too high, they don't review and they wouldn't have overturned the umpire as it would have stayed umpire's call, just clipping the bails. Philander is trying for lbw, with Cook's tendency to reach around his front pad to push inswingers to midwicket. Twice he gets him reaching but his line is too wide so Cook lets it hit the pad instead. \"Dreamy minded, lunchtime nostalgia sounds to me like a better caption for your main picture,\" writes Dave Espley. O captain! Your fearful trip is done?</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>Review: Trott lbw Steyn - given not out. Smith reviews. </strong></p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Trott lbw Steyn 8</strong> It took them an age to decide to review it and, though Trott looks Kallis-like with incredulity to be given out, he looked plumb, the ball hitting middle and leg.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>14th over: England 39-2 (Bell 1, Cook 7) South Africa 309 </strong> Trott picks up another four with a perfectly sweet cover drive. Steyn gets the radge on and tries to bounce him but Trott sways inside the line and the ball balloons through to De Villiers. He pitches the next one up and traps Trott with a hint of inswing. Trott was convinced it was missing leg, bowling as he is from the Pavilion End and angling down the hill but it would have clipped leg stump. Trott's head was too far over to off-stump to be sure it was missing I think. In comes Bell at No4 for the first time in three years and gets off the mark with a single through the leg-side ring.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>15th over: England 39-2 (Bell 1, Cook 7) South Africa 309 </strong> Dread words though they are, South Africa will be trilling about \"plans\" and \"areas\" after play with their so far successful variations of lines for each batsman. \"So,\" writes Hannah Marsh. \"Not mentioning the follow on score \u2026 how do we feel about that now? I'm going tomorrow and am beginning to feel sick with nerves.\" Ask me after the fall of the next wicket, Hannah. Maiden from Philander.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Cook c Kallis b Steyn 7</strong> Right, that follow on score is 110. Jesus, this is bad. Cook chased a wide one, like Morkel did this morning and Smith yesterday and got a thick edge to the cordon, Kallis this time at second slip.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>16th over: England 39-3 (Bell 1, Taylor 0) South Africa 309 </strong> Taylor comes in with his cycling helmet. The replay shows what a fine catch that was by Kallis, moving across Petersen at third slip to take it hip-high to his left while not looking at the ball. \"I had a free \u00a35 bet this morning on Andrew Strauss top scoring in this innings,\" writes Steve Pye. \"Nice to see the English batsman keeping my hopes alive!\". Steyn gives Taylor three bouncers in a row to say \"How do, Tich?\" then snakes the last across him towards first slip that Taylor leaves. Wicket maiden.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>17th over: England 39-3 (Bell 1, Taylor 0) South Africa 309 </strong> Bell shows the full face to the first three of Philander's deliveries, tries again to the fourth as it arcs past his edge. This is agonising, watching them exceute their plans for each batsman like Sirens luring them to doom. \"So \u2026 I'm asking again,\" says Hannah Marsh. \"How do we feel about that follow on score? I'm not feeling too confident now!\" I don't know, Hannah, but South Africa recovered from 54-4. I can't see England getting much past 200 but I think they will avoid the follow on.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>18th over: England 49-3 (Bell 1, Taylor 8) South Africa 309 </strong> But then again \u2026 Taylor gets off the mark with a swipe outside off that flies over slips for four but that was a very anxious stroke to one targeting his body again. Steyn goes a bit bananas screaming for lbw for an inswinger that was missing leg by five feet and then Taylor plays an excellent forcing shot on the up and on his toes through the covers for four.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>19th over: England 50-3 (Bell 2, Taylor 8) South Africa 309 </strong>Bell brings the 50 up with a decent stopped drive. Ranil Dissanayake speaks for many of you, apart from the end, most of you prefer something that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_(Blackadder)\">sounds almost exactly like luck</a>: \"Never you fret! England might be three down for fifty-odd, facing the best bowler in the world with his tail up, but their team spirit <em>couldn't be better</em>... Thank God they dropped the chap who last week was spanking these bowlers like a naughty three year old, eh? Can you imagine how they'd be if KP was in the team? 22 all out? Dagummit.\"</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>20th over: England 50-3 (Bell 2, Taylor 8) South Africa 309 </strong> An answer from Peter Withey for Pete Lovell, over 96. </p> <blockquote> <p>Trying to take my mind off the imminent collapse/follow-on, I've been perusing a mixture of Cricinfo and Wikipedia to try and respond to Re Peter Lovell's email in over 96.

C'mon The Ronster.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>21st over: England 51-3 (Bell 2, Taylor 8) South Africa 309 </strong> Kallis takes over from Philander and starts with a slow whanger that is called wide, deservedly so. He looks much slower than Broad but is hitting similar levels of pace around 78mph. Taylor is untroubled.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>22nd over: England 52-3 (Bell 2, Taylor 8) South Africa 309 </strong> Steyn goes off the field after his spell and Morkel has his first dart from the Pavilion End. \"Is this the shortest England partnership ever?\" asks Richard Green. Anyone know? Snare roll and cymbal crash references to time notwithstanding? Single for Bell.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>23rd over: England 52-3 (Bell 2, Taylor 8) South Africa 309 </strong> Another maiden, this time from Kallis, neither unduly threatening Bell nor giving him any room to push it off the front foot.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Taylor c Smith b Morkel 10 </strong> Prodded outside off-stump, taken low by Smith at first slip. We had to wait to see if it was a no-ball or not. It wasn't. 54 for four. Sounds familiar.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>24th over: England 56-4 (Bell 3, Bairstow 0) South Africa 309 </strong> Morkel greets Bairstow with a waist-high full toss which he fends off into the legside and called no-ball on height, then having read the script on Bairstow Morkel turns to bouncing him. The Yorkshireman sways out of the way of one, ducks the other and almost periscopes the next but gets his hands out of the line and anyway it's a no-ball.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>25th over: England 56-4 (Bell 3, Bairstow 0) South Africa 309 </strong> Bell leaves one that cuts back and whacks him straight in the Babybel. Yikes. Sara \"Finns for Finn\" Torvalds says: \"I've no idea if Bell/Taylor are the shortest pair, but I've been wondering who the shortest world-class wicketkeeper is. You'd think Sachin didn't really have to think about keeping (even though he's obviously missing a stumping in his otherwise reasonable carreer), but perhaps I'm wrong in thinking long arms are a requirement?\" Parthiv Patel is about 5ft 2in but I don't know if he still keeps wicket. Kallis claims another maiden. He's doing the smothering role today, back of a length, heavy ball, arrowed into the body.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>26th over: England 56-4 (Bell 3, Bairstow 0) South Africa 309 </strong> Morkel's up into the 90s having got a sniff of Bairstow and heard the name Kemar Roach being bandies about by the infield. This is the duffing up phase for Bairstow, then they'll play nice with one outside off and expect him to succumb with the physical threat off. And he does have a swish at a wider one. Welcome to your doctoral viva, Mr Bairstow. Your examiner today is Mr Morkel, aiming things at your head.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>27th over: England 64-4 (Bell 10, Bairstow 1) South Africa 309 </strong> Runs for bell with three from a steer through midwicket. He's been in for an hour for his six. Bairstow then cashes in with a single. \"Cheer up Peter Withey,\" writes Peter Lovell. \"The lowered expectations will work in Jonny Bairstow's favour and you're about to witness the innings of the summer.<br>Thanks for the statistical advice to turn my son into a bowler but unfortunately there's another set of damning statistics that prevent that from happening - He's a midget. Maybe I'll just have to settle for him being another inarticulate state school England footballer. At least he won't go have to go round patting his team-mates on the bum.\" Oh he will, Pete. It'll be compulsory by then.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>28th over: England 72-4 (Bell 10, Bairstow 9) South Africa 309 </strong> Rahul Dravid is in the Sky box with a floppy hairstyle. What a man. Now then. Bairstow cracks a short one from Morkel at head height through slips for four then plays a far more stylish shot with a pick over square leg right off the dead centre of the bat for another.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>29th over: England 73-4 (Bell 11, Bairstow 9) South Africa 309 </strong> There's a lot of moaning about England's useless batsmen and calling for the heads of Strauss and Flower coming my way. Come on. This partnership is what makes Test cricket great. One batsman trying to demolish doubts about his character and technique, the other who's been down that track more times than you can remember, working like hell against brilliant bowlers to put this poor start right. They might not get there. In fact they probably won't. But it's special to watch.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>30th over: England 76-4 (Bell 14, Bairstow 9) South Africa 309 </strong> Philander returns and Bell smears two to deep point. Bell's feet are moving well now. \"Having just read Pete Lovell's response in over 26, claiming his son to be a midget, I am baffled,\" writes Peter Withey. \"Since his original message read \"As we prepare for my son Noah's first days at our local primary,\" I sort of assumed the child was aged around five. It is therefore understandable if he is still quite short. Despair not, namesake Lovell, children grow!

Simon Taufel gives him not out and his decision is upheld but Bell's difficulty in reading Tahir does not bode well. \"Rob, it is indeed special to watch,\" writes Oliver Smiddy. \"But which would you rather see \u2013 a rookie, clad head-to-toe in protection, scratching about for runs and being worked over by Morkel and co; or a man who's made runs than any other player in the England team, and who, as recently as the last Test, absolutely flayed the South African attack with one of the best centuries in recent memory?\" Oh, KP, all the way if it hadn't been for those text messages. Everything else could and should have been discounted but they were dumb and, I believe, merited him being dropped. Two leg-byes off the last ball.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>32nd over: England 78-4 (Bell 14, Bairstow 9) South Africa 309 </strong> Maiden from Philander, watched and left patiently by Bairstow. \"No idea if this email even gets sent, so poor is my internet connection here at Lake Skadar in Montenegro (f5? Ha! Press that and you might lose the whole feed!),\" writes Ben Heywood. \"But I'd give poor little Boucher-be-sledged Tatenda Taibu at least a podium place on your titchy wicketkeepers list.

News of Kevin Pietersen, he's going to play for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/17/kevin-pietersen-surrey-hampshire\">Surrey v Hampshire on Sunday</a>.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>34th over: England 88-4 (Bell 16, Bairstow 17) South Africa 309 </strong> South Africa don't half take their time getting through their overs. I reckon Smyth's going to have 38 or so after tea till ale o'clock. Philander gets mid-off shining the ball for an age. Bairstow moves ahead of his partner by playing it off his hip and scampering two to square leg. \"To answer Oliver Smiddy's completely objective and non-leading question,\" writes Johs Robinson. \"The person I would like to see is the person that the captain, selectors, and (particularly) Andy Flower consider most likely to contribute to the best possible overall team performance over the course of the match.\"</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>35th over: England 91-4 (Bell 19, Bairstow 17) South Africa 309 </strong> Tahir is exasperated and stifles a scream when Bell misreads his googly and gets away with a thick edge when he'd taken two steps down the track to drive.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>36th over: England 91-4 (Bell 20, Bairstow 17) South Africa 309 </strong> Dale Steyn returns for Philander. Michael Holding pinpoints Jonny Bairstow's chest guard and thinks it's given him the confidence to wear the ball when they target him. Botham notes that the real change for Bairstow is that he's watched every ball which he didn't do v West Indies. \"Is KP from Pudsey rather than Pietermaritzburg?\" posits Ian Burch. \"I only ask as this sort of back-stabbing and bickering was the norm every season at Yorkshire where there would be some kind of bitter dispute between the players (past and present), skipper, cricket committee and the members. Most of it usually centred around Sir Geoffrey and I expect that KP will follow his lead and appear on a chat show with a sympathetic host in a few weeks time to give his side of the story.\" On CNN, Ian? Bell faces five of the over, Bairstow the last, ducking beneath Steyn's rather telegraphed bouncer.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>37th over: England 92-4 (Bell 20, Bairstow 17) South Africa 309 </strong> If you can medal and podium, can you maiden?

Steyn digs it in again at Bairstow which he knocks on to his hip via the splice. Next ball is another short one that Bairstow ducks then clips the third off his pads for two to long leg. Graeme Smith is doing the equivalent of repeating everything someone says to you in a squeaky voice - think Windsor Davies in It Ain't Half Hot Mum \u2013 by mimicking Bairstow's stance and shots and chatting very loudly about his technique. But he sees out the over and the session.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>Tea</strong></p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>Tense, nervous headache?</strong> Well you'd better turn the bloody cricket off then, hadn't you? The next two-and-a-half hours are going to be seriously tense. England aren't a million miles from the brink, 94 for four in reply to South Africa's 309, but they are still in this game. This match is starting to vaguely resemble the final two matches of the series between these sides in 1998, a lowish-scoring dogfight in which every run is hard earned and the initiative is like a hot potato. By the end of a long evening session (36 overs) we should have a slightly better idea who is likely to win the match, the series and the world No1 rankings.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>39th over: England 94-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 20, Bairstow 19)</strong> The excellent Morne Morkel starts the evening session, immediately getting the ball up and around Ian Bell's fragrant armpits. A maiden. Bell played watchfully before tea, as he has all series: he has 20 from 83 balls now, and <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/9062.html?class=1;orderby=batting_strike_rate;orderbyad=reverse;template=results;type=batting;view=series\">his series strike rate of 24 is comfortably the lowest of his Test career.</a></p> <p> \"Although not an international, can I get in a tribute to my club wicketkeeper, B<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/uabhanu\">hanu Upadhyayula</a>?\" says Ben Mimmack. \"He stands barely higher than the stumps but is a demon when standing up to the medium pacers. He's also good for fielding discipline - any throw from the field that comes in more than a couple of feet over the stumps is pretty much guaranteed overthrows.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>40th over: England 97-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 21, Bairstow 21)</strong> Steyn comes around the wicket to Bairstow, with a short leg, a fine leg slip and a plan as old as the hills. Bairstow takes on the short ball, pulling round the corner for a single, and then pushes another later in the over off a relatively full delivery. It's vital that England see off this burst from Steyn.</p> <p>\"'Scuse gratuitous pedantry (yeah, ok, as if my emails ever contain anything else), but I think most of us already have a very good idea indeed of 'who is likely to win the match, the series and the world No1 rankings',\" says Josh Robinson. \"This being cricket, it's just possible that by the end of the session we'll have a different idea, but at this point South Africa are clear favourites.\" You say that, but the chaps on Sky reckon these are perfect batting conditions. Us innate optimists certainly aren't writing this game off.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>41st over: England 101-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 21, Bairstow 25)</strong> I didn't see the afternoon session but it seems Bairstow showed plenty of ticker in the face of the inevitable assault. He's getting it from both ends here, although Morkel's attack is less explicit than Steyn. He is over the wicket and bowling just back of a length rather than banging it in. Bairstow defends a few and then pulls thrillingly over square leg for four.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>42nd over: England 107-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 26, Bairstow 26)</strong> England get an overthrow in bizarre circumstances. Bell drove to extra cover, at which point AB de Villiers, thinking the ball was effectively dead, set off after a pigeon that was lurking on the off side. The fielder didn't realise and threw the ball to the keeper's end and England stole a run. That was wonderfully absurd. If England win this match by one wicket the pigeon will surely merit an MBE. Bell gets a lovely boundary later in the over with a crisp square drive off Steyn. That brings up a vital, cool-headed fifty partnership from 113 balls.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>43rd over: England 109-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 26, Bairstow 28)</strong> With the ball not doing much for the seamers, Imran Tahir comes into the attack. Bairstow shows good judgement to leave a delivery just outside off stump and then scampers back for two after a cut to deep point.</p> <p>\"Enough of all this modern cricket,\" says Brough Cooper. \"Tomorrow I face the considerable talents (and even more considerable girth) of Martin McCague on the cricket field. He no longer bothers with trundling in to bowl, content to open the batting and attempt to launch every ball into the surrounding countryside. Would you like an autograph?\" <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpBzMVduF8\">Will you ask him if he does adverts?</a></p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>44th over: England 113-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 30, Bairstow 28)</strong> Bell follows an outswinger from Steyn, steering it short of and then through the slips for four. England will probably feel Steyn has one more over after this and will be desperate to see him off. This is the sort of situation in which Steyn so often reminds us why he has no peer. Bell defends the remainder of the over. This is <em>terrific</em> stuff.</p> <p>\"Evening Rob, evening everybody,\" says Guy Hornsby. \"I feel your pain given the 34789583 overs still left to bowl today, but this has the makings of a session of <em>real cricket</em>. With so much slap and wallop around there's something beautiful and old-fashioned about a 2.5 run-an-over battle between willow and leather. It's so very 1993. I think we're doing the right thing here. There's still so much time left, and batting out today with none or possibly one down will mean we're still in this game tomorrow if we're close to 200 at the end. We've got a long tail, and this sort of gritty survival could be the making of Jonny Bairstow. The lad's got talent, and he'll have few sterner tests than this in his first few England games. Where's Atherton where you need him? He must be LOVING this in the commentary box.\"</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>45th over: England 113-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 30, Bairstow 28)</strong> Tahir. Bairstow. Maiden. Deal with it. \"I enjoyed a lot of those Olympic sports, even warming to the handball and I've been known to watch that game that starts its Premier League tomorrow, but there's nothing quite like hard-edged Test cricket is there?\" says Gary Naylor. \"How did they get this game so right, so long ago?\"</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>46th over: England 114-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 31, Bairstow 28)</strong> Bell starts to poke at an outswinger from Steyn and then pulls it back away at the last minute. Steyn is steaming in with his usual hard-faced intent, and almost every ball is demanding a stroke from Bell or Bairstow.</p> <p>\"This is a great match, TMS is almost unbearably tense,\" says Martin Sinclair. \"However, they've played well these two. The ball should be getting old now, so the short stuff should become less threatening, you would hope for BellStow's sake at least. Do you think reverse swing will come into play and at what point?\" It'll definitely be after 62.4 overs. Not a ball before, not a ball after. End of, fact, etcetera. Er, I have no idea. You'd think it might reverse in these conditions \u2013 it's very hot \u2013 although ultimately nobody knows anything.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>47th over: England 121-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 38, Bairstow 28)</strong> Bell plays an inventive stroke, lapping Tahir very fine for a couple. He charges the next ball, driving it in the air and wide of mid off for four. It was a bit closer to the man than he would have intended but not within catching range. </p> <p>\"Can Bell save the day, please?\" dearJims Eva Broer. \"After seeing him bat at the Oval on the fifth day of the first Test in this series I developed a little crush on him and crushes need feeding otherwise they just peter out.\"</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>48th over: England 121-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 38, Bairstow 28)</strong> The good news for England is that Dale Steyn has been taken out of the attack. The bad news is that <strike> we're all doomed </strike> Morne Morkel is going to replace him. He'll do so with a new ball, the umpires having changed it between overs. His first delivery is a preposterous snorter, a vicious lifter that Bell did superbly to glove short of the slips. A maiden.</p> <p>\"Completely off topic, but my favorite ever charity cricket match was a World XI vs Norfolk Select side,\" says Steven Blowers. \"The World side had the not inconsiderable talent of Ian Bishop opening the bowling against Wayne Larkins. To me as a 12 year old it looked like he was starting his run up from the boundary. I watched in awe as 6ft 5ins of West Indian fast bowler tormented the batsmen. Needless to say after a few 90mph deliveries he was asked to take it down a notch because the Norfolk openers were having difficulty seeing the ball. Perhaps Strauss and Cook could ask Steyn to dial it down a bit as well?\" '<a href=\"www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVZIUwtGP1U#t=0m20s\">Yeah alright Dale, turn it in</a>.'</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>49th over: England 133-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 38, Bairstow 41)</strong> Top stuff from Bairstow, who belts Tahir for three boundaries in four balls: a slightly ugly drag to midwicket, a crisp clip to the same area and then a beautiful flick wide of mid on. He has 41 from 74 balls and has played extremely well under intense pressure on both a personal and team level.</p> <p>\"Is it too early,\" begins Jamie Jermain, \"to start talking about Ronald's inevitable career defining, no-one else made a century this innings, look who's batting at 4 now, Smyth had my back all along hundred?\" Editor's note: Jamie Jermain's full address and phone number will be available upon request as soon as Ian Bell is dismissed for 41.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>50th over: England 137-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 40, Bairstow 42)</strong> Bairstow has an absent-minded, angled-batted waft at Morkel, meeting only with fresh air. A single brings Bell on strike and he receives another brutish lifter that he can only steer fortuitously over the slips for two. There was an element of control, in that he realised he was in trouble and so twisted the bat for an uppercut, but there was a bigger element of fortune.</p> <p>\"Steve Finn mentioned it was lush and green yesterday so that means there will be no reverse,\" says Peter Lovell. \"It needs to dry to create an abrasive pitch to scuff the ball to create reverse swing. It might have reversed back in March but not now.\"</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>51st over: England 140-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 42, Bairstow 43)</strong> Tahir lures Bairstow towards the flame and turns one past the outside edge. Bell paddles a couple later in the over. This is such a good contest; cricket for grown-ups. You'd say South Africa are probably still on top, but not by much at all. </p> <p>\"Please, please Rob, stop publishing things about Bell,\" writes Clare Davies. \"Let's all just keep very quiet and then perhaps Fate won't know what we're all hoping. You know what usually happens so stop it, stop it now!\"</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>52nd over: England 142-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 42, Bairstow 44)</strong> I'd give Kallis a short spell here. It'd be just like him to snare another sucker at a crucial time and then cackle contentedly while everyone celebrates around him. Bell tries to uppercut Morkel, but it's too short and bounces over his attempted stroke. Then Morkel bowls a no-ball. Every run is a precious thing. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_cricket_team_in_England_in_1998\">More and more this feels like Trent Bridge and Headingley 1998</a>. </p> <p>\"Splendid game, and I say that as a South African supporter,\" says Richard Mansell. \"It's a tough, hard-fought match, as it should be, and it could go either way. I don't agree with the writer who said that SA were going to win \u2013 it's anybody's. I do think there'll be a result, though, with some much more still to play. That said, I think on balance (or perhaps on paper) SA are the stronger team without the novice batsmen, but I could well be proved wrong.\"</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>53rd over: England 145-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 43, Bairstow 46)</strong> \"So much drama in the England team lately that I wonder if anyone has noticed Trott not making any runs,\" says Dan Minford. \"How long before he feels a bit of pressure?\" It'll be a while yet. As you say, England have much bigger problems than Jonathan Trott, even though <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/47623.html?class=1;template=results;type=batting;view=reverse_cumulative\">he does average only 32 from his last 15 Tests</a>.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>54th over: England 154-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 43, Bairstow 55)</strong> Bairstow snicks Morkel low through the slips for four to reach a thoroughly admirable half-century, his first in Tests. A number of the England balcony are on their feet and, as Peter Lovell points out, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/234648073014476803\">a gentleman called Piers may just have shut his mouth</a>. For a couple of seconds. When you consider the context of Bairstow's innings \u2013 his struggles against the West Indies, the man he's replacing, coming in at 56 for four against a magnificent attack in a decider for the world No1 ranking \u2013 this has been a wonderful performance. He's got ticker and talent, which is a decent starting point for a young batsman. Three more through midwicket brings up the hundred partnership.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>55th over: England 161-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 47, Bairstow 58)</strong> Kallis is on, an excellent move by Graeme Smith. If one of these two batsmen slice a filthy wide half-volley to slip I may well weep forever more. Bairstow times three more off the thigh through midwicket; on Sky, Nasser Hussain tells us he has made 30 from his last 23 balls. Bell has been more circumspect but he takes advantage of one of those wide Kallis specials, squirting it square for four.</p> <p>\"It's nice that Graeme Smith reads the OBO and all,\" says Alistair Halton, \"but if Kallis snags one we're coming for you.\" Let's do it. The OBO Fight Club.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>56th over: England 161-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 47, Bairstow 58)</strong> A double bowling change, with Philander replacing Morkel. He starts well wide of off stump to Bairstow, who leaves a few and then almost drags an attempted pull onto his stumps. There are 18 overs remaining in the day. <a href=\"http://www.skysports.com/video/inline/0,,12607_7999204,00.html\">In other news, here's that pigeon business from earlier</a>.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>57th over: England 165-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 51, Bairstow 58)</strong> Bell chases another wide one from Kallis and is beaten, but a delightful back cut for four next ball takes him to a mature and classy half-century from 133 balls. He's playing beautifully. </p> <p>\"God help me for continuing to entertain him,\" says Tom Hooper, \"but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/236495675754422273\">today's award for most sycophantic tweet goes to you-know-who</a>, especially in light of the one you linked to as Jonny got his 50.\"</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>58th over: England 166-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 51, Bairstow 59)</strong> Philander is generally bowling a fifth-stump line to Bairstow, attempting to bore him out. This next hour is buttock-clenchingly important; the difference between an overnight 220 for four and 200 for six is definitely 20 runs and two wickets. Honk! Honk with me now.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>59th over: England 168-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 52, Bairstow 60)</strong> Kallis keeps dangling the ball outside Bell's outside off stump. He's like a bloody femme fatale, albeit one with special hair, just waiting to snare another patsy.</p> <p>\"55th over,\" says Matt Dony. \"Hmmm. Smyth. Clearly a pampered public school lad, and soft southern middle-class journo to boot. If it comes to it, my money's on Alistair 'Knuckles' Halton.\" If you can survive the mean streets of, er, Sittingbourne, a fist-flaunting Guardian reader is nothing to worry about. Let's do this. Let's have a row.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>60th over: England 173-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 53, Bairstow 64)</strong> The game has gone quiet, the result of South Africa's off theory. They will happily do this for the next half hour or so, or until they get a wicket, at which point Steyn and Morkel will be summoned again to raise hell. That line is fine for Philander provided the length is good, but when he drops short Bairstow cuts confidently for four.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>61st over: England 178-4 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bell 58, Bairstow 64)</strong> Tahir replaces Kallis. His first ball is a touch too short and flicked brilliantly through midwicket for four by Bell. These are vital runs; England can't just bat time, because the new ball is due after 80 overs and it's far from inconceivable that they will be cleaned up with it, depending on how many wickets have fallen when it's taken. For England, this is the time to cash in. </p> <p>\"Isn't this the Test that England's much-vaunted lower order need to come to the party?\" says Chris Goater. \"Much was made of the superiority of our tail vs the Saffers, but there's not been much evidence so far. Broad in particular has been a disappointment. With SA's Nos7 and 8 making 61 each, Broad and Swann will need to work hard. Is Finn any good with a bat?\" He can clout a ball, but he's below Anderson, which tells a story. As does his first-class average: 6.86.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 178-5 (Bell c Petersen b Philander 58)</strong> Ian Bell has gone! Another twist in this marvellous Test match. The fifth-stump line has worked for Philander. Bell was beaten twice in the course of an excellent over, and then went for a drive at a fuller delivery that moved away just enough to take the edge. It flew low to a wide slip position, wher Alviro Petersen took a beautifully unobtrusive catch at ankle height. Bell swishes his bat and shakes his head in frustration. He had worked desperately hard for those 58 runs.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>62nd over: England 178-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 64, Prior 0)</strong> There are twelve overs are remaining in the day. There might be a temptation for England to play for the close now, but I suspect Prior in particular will attack.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>63rd over: England 181-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 65, Prior 2)</strong> Tahir continues for now \u2013 there is bound to be one last burst from Steyn pretty soon \u2013 and is worked for a single by Bairstow. Prior then gets off the mark with two to deep point. England's running has been very good in this session. There are 11 overs remaining today.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>64th over: England 183-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 67, Prior 2)</strong> \"The first rule of OBO Fight Club,\" says Simon McMahon. \"Never, ever, ever, EVER start to hope.\" As Brad Pitt said in the film, how much can you know about yourself if you've never endured an England batting collapse?</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>65th over: England 187-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 67, Prior 6)</strong> Morne Morkel replaces Imran Tahir. His first ball is short, wide and dismissed through extra cover for four. A fuller delivery beats the edge later in the over. Ebb and flow, the match in miniature. \"Noble of Bell to sacrifice his wicket to Philander to prevent a rumble,\" says Alistair Halton. \"I'd just got my handbag restrapped, too.\"</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>66th over: England 187-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 67, Prior 6)</strong> There are nine overs remaining in theory, although play can't go on beyond 6.30pm. Time, then, for one final burst from Dale Steyn. There are final bursts and final bursts. What kind is this to be? Bairstow almost induces a coronary by dragging a drive back onto his pads, and then does induce one by offering no stroke to an inswinger that <em>just</em> bounces over the stumps. A maiden.</p> <p>\"If witnessing an England batting collapse led to self-knowledge,\" says Peter McLeod, \"I'm pretty sure I would have achieved full enlightenment by now.\"</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>67th over: England 193-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 67, Prior 12)</strong> This is an excellent battle between Prior and Morkel. A play and miss is followed by a withering square drive for four and a work off the hip for two. </p> <p>\"If Finn really wants to keep his place, he'll learn how to bat properly,\" writes John Starbuck. \"Stuart Broad began as a batsman so it shows one can change, and Anderson learned enough to become something other than a total rabbit. He must have had plenty of experience by now so what might he do if properly coached? Get Sir Geoffrey to have a word or two.\"</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>68th over: England 198-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 68, Prior 16)</strong> I wonder how tired Bairstow is mentally. After that dodgy leave in the previous over he started dancing around at the crease, trying to sharpen his focus. The best way to play Dale Steyn, of course, is from the other end, and Bairstow takes a single off the third ball. Prior, who is continuing to attack, misses an extravagant flash at a wider delivery. A steer through the slips next ball brings him his third boundary. Prior has 16 from 22 balls. He doesn't really do backward steps, does he.</p> <p>\"Hmmm, Smith's got a shortish point and a very deep gully in now for Prior, says SB Tang. \"I suspect he's employing the same plan Stephen Fleming used to famous effect against Damien Martyn \u2014 pack his favourite scoring area in the gully/point region with fielders, bowl wide of off stump and dare him to cut and square drive.\"</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>69th over: England 198-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 68, Prior 16)</strong> Bairstow is playing for the close now. He has scored one from his last 19 deliveries and focuses exclusively on defence in that maiden from Morkel.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>70th over: England 201-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 70, Prior 17)</strong> Bairstow is almost completely becalmed now. That's understandable so near to the close after a mentally exhausting day, although such an approach is always a little scary for those of a partisan nature. The ball slips out of Steyn's hand during his bowling action. Bairstow considers belting it for four and decides he probably wouldn't like an angry Dale Steyn. He does clip the next ball for a couple to take England past 200.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>71st over: England 204-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 72, Prior 18)</strong> Kallis is going to bowl a solitary over before the close. He scares the hell out of me with the ball, and he so nearly draws an edge from Bairstow, beaten as he drives absent-mindedly outside off. Bairstow walks away to square leg to sharpen his focus, stopping just short of slapping himself about the coupon. He'll sleep well tonight.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>72nd over: England 208-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 72, Prior 22)</strong> Dale Steyn will bowl the last over of the day. He has a big shout for LBW when Prior whips around a full delivery. Kumar Dharmasena says not out and South Africa rightly decide not to review. It was going down leg. Prior is beaten next ball, fishing where a man should never fish. This is brilliant from Steyn, who must be absolutely shattered yet is storming in like it's 11.02am. He tries for the killer yorker next ball; it's too straight and Prior flicks it fine for four. The following delivery goes past the edge again. A stunning over to end an outstanding day's play. God bless Test cricket. England trail by 101 runs, and both sides will sleep pretty soundly: England because they have recovered from 58 for four, South Africa because the new ball is due in eight overs' time. The man of the day was Jonny Bairstow, who made a lovely 72 not out under all sorts of personal and team pressure. Thanks for your emails; see you tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p>It's not often that an American election sparks debate about a philosopher. But ever since Mitt Romney announced his selection of Paul Ryan as his vice presidential candidate, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/17/ayn-rand-institue-evolving-legacy\">talk has turned to the ideas of novelist-philosopher Ayn Rand</a>. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/16/what-paul-ryan-learned-from-ayn-rand.html\">Ryan is on record as being a fan of Rand's</a>, and although he has taken pains to distance himself from her entire philosophy, he continues to stress that her novel Atlas Shrugged \"is a great novel\". Ryan is far from the only one who thinks so. Since the financial meltdown of 2008, Rand's 1957 novel has sold more than 1.5 million copies.</p> <p>But here's something interesting: virtually all of those sales took place in the US. Why are so many Americans, from students to politicians, talking about Rand's novel \u2013 and why are her books comparatively unknown in Europe?</p> <p>The answer to both questions is the same: Atlas Shrugged is a hymn to the American spirit.</p> <p>The American spirit is characterized by independence, individualism, political and economic freedom, and productive ambition. It's the sense of life best summed up in the American Revolutionary motto \"Don't tread on Me.\" It was this spirit that led so many Americans to rebel against the post 2008 expansion of state power. They didn't just see big government as a threat to the economy: it was an affront to their whole conception of what America is about. After eight years of Bush and eight minutes of Obama, they were fed up with being tread upon.</p> <p>Atlas speaks to this spirit. Set in a world eerily similar to ours \u2013 a world where the economy is crumbling, where government intervention is growing, and where productive individuals are denounced and drained for the sake of the unproductive \u2013 it tells the story of men and women who decide to <em>stop</em> being tread upon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394869635\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/3/9/1236641849173/Ayn-Rand-005.jpg\" alt=\"Ayn Rand\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Author and philosopher Ayn Rand. Photograph: Hulton Archive/New York Times Co./Getty</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/New York Times Co./Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the dramatic story contains a powerful intellectual punch: Atlas gives the American spirit a philosophic defense it has never had. The American spirit often has been attacked as atomistic, cruel, and materialistic. Atlas blasts any such notion. It shows that capitalism is a win-win system where all individuals are free to pursue their happiness. It shows that it is <em>right</em> for individuals to be concerned with their own happiness. And it shows that those who seek to \"tread on you\" \u2013&#xa0;to control your life, redistribute your wealth, and mortgage your future \u2013 are <em>morally wrong</em>. <br>&#xa0;<br>It's no accident, then, that Ayn Rand's immense popularity in America has not crossed over to Europe. It's for the same reason that Europeans largely embraced the government's post-financial crisis interventionist policies \u2013 from bailouts to stimulus spending sprees to vast new regulatory powers \u2013 while Americans rebelled. Whatever motto best captures the European attitude toward life, \"Don't tread on me\" is not it.</p> <p>Ayn Rand wrote Atlas, in part, as a warning to Americans. She believed that, as early as 1890, America had veered from its free-market roots and was descending into statism. (She would have regarded as absurd the widely-held notion that America in the years before the financial crisis had anything resembling a free market.) To reverse that trend, Americans would have to translate their individualistic spirit into an explicit ideological program: one that upheld individualism and laissez-faire capitalism as moral and political ideals.</p> <p>To succeed in this task, Rand argued, Americans would need to question and reject the alien idea of altruism. Altruism is the Old World doctrine that it's your duty to live for others and renounce your own self-interest. In one form or another, this moral doctrine has been the justification for every welfare program. Other people need money for their retirement or healthcare, it's claimed, and therefore they're entitled to that money from you. The individual's pursuit of his own happiness versus altruism \u2013 this is the choice facing America.</p> <p>Although Rand was primarily speaking to Americans, she was not only speaking to Americans. The spirit of America, she held, is open to any individual willing to think. Today, as Europe is doubling down on the welfare state, that spirit, and the ideas of Atlas Shrugged, are needed more than ever.</p>",
  "<p>Although Phyllis Thaxter, who has died aged 92, had a successful career in films throughout the 1940s and 50s, many will remember her for her last movie role, in Superman (1978). It was the small but key part of Ma Kent, the childless farmer's wife who adopts a foundling baby and names him Clark. Together with her husband (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/sep/01/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Glenn Ford</a>) \u2013 both made intentionally to resemble the couple in Grant Wood's American Gothic painting \u2013 they bring up the abnormally physically gifted boy until he's ready to fly off \"to fight for truth, justice and the American way\".</p> <p>At one stage, she tells him: \"We Kents don't like show-offs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbours.\" A fragile beauty, Thaxter was never a show-off, but made an impact in a gentle way, frequently portraying wholesome, devoted wives and girlfriends. She shared that quality with the likes of Margaret Sullavan, June Allyson and Teresa Wright, though without having their star power.</p> <p>She was born in Portland, Maine, the daughter of a US supreme court judge. Her mother, who had been on the stage, encouraged her daughter to take up acting. Thaxter started to appear in summer stock, before making her Broadway debut, aged 19, in Robert E Sherwood's There Shall Be No Night (1940), which starred Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, and the 20-year-old Montgomery Clift.</p> <p>Thaxter's theatre work led to her being offered the role of the pregnant wife of the second world war pilot played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/dec/15/van-johnson-died-obituary-filmstar\" title=\"\">Van Johnson</a> in Mervyn LeRoy's excellent war drama Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo (1944). Although she had only a few scenes, Thaxter made enough impression to gain an MGM contract. According to the New York Times critic: \"Phyllis Thaxter is surpassingly affecting as the wife of Captain Lawson. Her comparative newness as an actress and a wistful voice give her a rare advantage.\"</p> <p>The role, more or less, set the pattern for her film career. However, she had a rare chance to play against her nice-girl persona in Bewitched (1945). Described on the posters as \"Darling of society, Cruel love killer, She lived two amazing lives\", Thaxter played a schizophrenic \u2013 both a femme fatale and a good girl, female archetypes of film noir. She is a sweet young thing, who literally hears an evil voice within her, urging her on to murder. But it was back to pure pure sweetness and light in the all-star Week-End at the Waldorf (1945), in which she wrongly believes her fiance to be in love with a film star (played by Ginger Rogers), until persuaded otherwise. In Living in a Big Way (1947), she is a pretty war widow with three children who offers comfort to unhappily married Gene Kelly, and in Tenth Avenue Angel (1948), she is the doting mother of Margaret O'Brien, the little girl who infects everyone, except the audience, with her faith and joy.</p> <p>Thaxter's last movie for MGM was Fred Zinnemann's Act of Violence (1948), in which she tries to be the voice of reason to stop an embittered ex-PoW played by Robert Ryan from wreaking revenge on his commanding officer (Van Heflin), who betrayed him to the Nazis.</p> <p>Before taking up a contract with Warner Bros, Thaxter appeared in Robert Wise's noir western Blood on the Moon (1948) for RKO, where she is a wealthy cattle baron's daughter, sorely used by baddie Robert Preston, who promises her marriage. Her first role for Warners, in The Breaking Point (1950), a remake of To Have and Have Not, based on the Ernest Hemingway short story, was one of her best. Made to look dowdy, she is remarkably effective as the practical wife of a charter boat captain, played by John Garfield. Trying in vain to convince him to sell his boat and make a steady living, she tells him, \"Pop says you can have a job anytime on his lettuce ranch in Salinas.\" Worried that he might be attracted to the blonde Patricia Neal, Thaxter desperately lightens her hair.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the studio didn't offer her anything better, with not much to do other than nobly stand by her man: Randolph Scott in Fort Worth (1951), Burt Lancaster in Man of Bronze (aka Jim Thorpe \u2013 All American, 1951), Gig Young in Come Fill the Cup (1951), Ronald Reagan as a put-upon professor in She's Working Her Way Through College (1952), and Gary Cooper as a Union officer facing a court martial for southern sympathies in Springfield Rifle (1952). It might have been much of the same, had she not contracted a form of polio. Although she recovered relatively quickly, Warners terminated her contract.</p> <p>With few further film roles offered to her, Thaxter took to television in the 50s and 60s. Her film comeback in Superman was brought about by Ilya Salkind, the executive producer on the film, who was Thaxter's son-in-law. He was married briefly to the actor Skye Aubrey, Thaxter's daughter by James T Aubrey, a president of CBS-TV and later MGM. Thaxter and Aubrey divorced in 1962, and she married the publisher Gilbert Lea, who died in 2008. She is survived by her daughter, and her son, James Aubrey.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Phyllis Thaxter, actor, born 20 November 1919; died 14 August 2012</p>",
  "<p>Having the means to buy clothes has historically been a symbol of status and it still remains one area of people's lives where income differences and social status area readily perceivable.</p> <p>An office worker in the Victorian era, whether in <a href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/economics/wages2.html\" title=\"\">London</a>, <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=u282hWa0d1QC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;dq=wages+cotton+mills+yorkshire&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rM8rgyPxpk&amp;sig=NYmE4LvRVJOOR8ld6_Td7zX_KHY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0tanT66dMMHb8QPSwa34BA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=wages%20cotton%20mills%20yorkshire&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">Yorkshire</a> or <a href=\"http://oldrecipebook.com/1800s-livingcost.shtml\" title=\"\">New York</a>, would spend equal amounts on clothing and rent each year, and households would be able to survive on a single income. In contrast, labourer families would struggle to have sufficient food on the table with a single salary. Only by combining the wife's and children's salaries would there be enough food and perhaps some clothes, if not shoes, for the family.</p> <p>These specifics of the past are very different to the present, where <a href=\"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/product_details/publication?p_product_code=KS-DY-09-001\" title=\"\">the average EU household</a> spends only 5.7% of income on clothing and footwear. In the US, where <a href=\"http://mjperry.blogspot.co.uk/2010/03/spending-on-clothing-and-footwear-falls.html\" title=\"\">in 2009 citizens bought</a> $326bn of clothing, people spend as little as 2.98% of their income on clothes. This is down from 4.78% in 1988 and 9% in 1950, confirming a trend that has been apparent since <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1177/1077727X8901700301/abstract\" title=\"\">before the second world war</a>.</p> <p>This goes hand in hand with a fall in price-per-item. In other words, we can buy the same, or even larger, amount of clothing, but spend substantially less. The <a href=\"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/product_details/publication?p_product_code=KS-DY-09-001\" title=\"\">EU-27 consumer statistical survey</a> shows that since 1996 overall clothing prices have, on average, declined \u2013 despite an inflation of around 2.2% \u2013 which would normally result in a price increase. In the UK, garment prices fell by an average of 10% between 2003 and 2007, and in 2006 people bought a third more clothes than in 2002. While the 2007 recession left the total sales volume in the UK clothing retail market largely unaffected, the retail price of clothing deteriorated drastically.</p> <p>Outsourcing to low-cost overseas locations, often lacking governmental enforcement of minimum health and safety standards, accounts for an important aspect of the retail price decreases in apparel. Since the 1974 Multi Fibre Agreement, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CFoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unido.org%2Ffileadmin%2Fuser_media%2FPublications%2FPub_free%2FGlobalization_changed_global_dynamics_of_clothing_and_textile_value_chains_and_impact_on_subSaharan_Africa.pdf&amp;ei=LbunT-qpJOqd0AX0upz4Aw&amp;usg=AFQjCNE2BlQ1a5ss4t-Xi-zOxzua7cf8XA\" title=\"\">an ever increasing percentage</a> of clothing is produced in low-cost countries and imported back into western consuming nations.</p> <p>But, possibly even of more importance, the fast fashion \"race to the bottom\" is also accompanied by lower product quality standards. In 2006, the average life span of a garment in London was three years. However, Primark in Oxford Street did not open until 2007, and it is safe to speculate that the life span may now be even shorter.</p> <p>In 2008, about 80% of all donated clothing was in good enough condition to either be reused as secondhand clothing, baled goods to developing countries, or sold to rag sorters. In 2011 this percentage had fallen to between 60 to 70%. In the same period, the total amount of clothing donated for recycling decreased by about 20%, while the total amount of clothing discarded remained stable or grew.</p> <p>Contemporary fashion consumption patterns, hence, have a direct correlation with lower garment quality. A well finished pair of jeans for example, requires a certain amount of labour, and therefore time, to sew. Making more items in a shorter period of time can only mean one thing: less time per item, and therefore more mistakes and imperfections with the result being that the product will fall apart quicker.</p> <p>In combination with the prospects of impending <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/blog/cotton-farming-fashion-fuel-food-shortages\" title=\"\">raw material</a>, <a href=\"http://environmentalgeographies.wordpress.com/2012/03/11/water-the-real-fashion-victim/\" title=\"\">water shortages</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/business/global/17textile.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">rising salaries</a> in principle manufacturing destinations such as China, it is plausible that changes in sourcing and manufacturing patterns are imminent, and will affect brands of all types and price levels.</p> <p>An indicator of this is <a href=\"http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/299207/chinese-garment-manufacturers-plan-relocate-here-due-labor-advantage\" title=\"\">Chinese</a> and <a href=\"http://www.just-style.com/news/garment-plants-relocating-to-bangladesh_id111608.aspx\" title=\"\">Pakistani</a> manufacturers relocating their whole production to destinations such as the Philippines and Bangladesh in order to maintain their price competitiveness which is primarily based on low cost man power.</p> <p>The rise in costs of upstream manufacturing will affect consumers in the west, and could trigger the first clothing price increase in nearly a century. The question is not if this will happen, but when.</p> <p>For many consumers price acts as an <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-31041343/cornells-heffetz-price-trumps-quality-perception-in-purchasing-decisions/\" title=\"\">indicator of quality</a> with a higher price suggesting better quality. As a consequence of rising manufacturing costs, the price of fast fashion will go up, leaving consumers with the expectation that quality will also improve accordingly.</p> <p>Beyond quality however, higher prices are prone to more scrutiny by the consumers overall. Low environmental and social standards may be just about acceptable for low quality and low price products, but not for something of a supposedly higher standard, as <a href=\"http://business.blogs.cnn.com/2011/10/12/gucci-faces-sweatshop-claims-in-china/\" title=\"\">luxury brands such as Gucci</a> have experienced.</p> <p>All costs accounted for, producing geographically closer to home suddenly becomes financially more attractive. This increases the ability to exercise tighter control over product manufacturing and at the high end of the apparel and foot wear market this is already happening.</p> <p>It goes without saying that this comes with challenges. First, textile manufacturing skills and qualified production units have largely disappeared over the past 30 years, and resuscitating or rebuilding such skill is a painstaking, slow, expensive and difficult process. Producing closer to home also means that long forgotten about legal and social issues related to textile manufacturing \u2013 such as waste, environmental impact, fair wages and labour conditions \u2013 will demand a local solutions.</p> <p>Fast fashion has democratised style over past decades, specifically in the west. This is a contribution that cannot be ignored. Historically, buying clothes was in essence and for the vast majority of people, equivalent to spending on something practical to cover up ones' nudity, and survive under given climatic conditions. Dressing up in order to look good was an exclusive privilege of the better off. Fast fashion changed the rules of this game fundamentally.</p> <p>The social gap these days is not any more between those that can, or cannot, afford to look stylish, but rather between those that can, or not, afford to look \"classily\" fashionable . For a fashion business and brand, this means that quality in production as well as design will increasingly be considered a basic prerequisite.</p> <p><em>Dr Pamela Ravasio is an independent researcher, journalist and consultant specialising in sustainable fashion businesses processes</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Thus far, much of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/17/julian-assange-ecuador-asylum-row\">coverage of Julian Assange's successful political asylum application to Ecuador</a> has focused on the international legal and diplomatic aspects and implications of the case. In fact, domestic Ecuadorian politics have played a vital role in the decision-making process for the administration of Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa.</p> <p>The backdrop to the Assange case has been the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador, slated to be held just six months from now in February 2013. President Correa, who was first elected in 2007, will be seeking a second term under Ecuador's 2008 constitution.</p> <p>Opinion polls published in the Ecuadorian media in 2012 have shown Correa with a commanding lead over his prospective opponents, largely because there is no consensus challenger. <a href=\"http://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/index.php?option=com_zoo&amp;task=item&amp;item_id=39858&amp;Itemid=2\">Polling from CMS in March showed</a> Correa with just under 49% of the vote, more than 40 points ahead of the five included challengers, who polled between 1% and 9% each. Thiry percent of voters, however, said that they had not chosen a candidate to support. <a href=\"http://www.larepublica.ec/blog/politica/2012/07/24/lasso-ya-encabeza-el-peloton-de-candidaturas-opuestas-a-correa/\">More recent polling has shown</a> the emergence of Guillermo Lasso as the closest prospective candidate with 17% of the vote, while undecided voters fell to 17%. Correa held fast with 50% of the vote.</p> <p>With a split field, Correa is practically guaranteed a win. Ecuadorian electoral law does not require the winning candidate to garner a majority of the popular vote; if a candidate receives at least 40% of the vote and is at least 10 points ahead of the next finisher, he or she wins in the first round.</p> <p>Election observers, including the Correa campaign, view Guillermo Lasso as the candidate most capable of forcing a runoff and, indeed, possibly winning the election. Despite being the former head of a major bank (the Bank of Guayaquil) and an economic adviser to former President Lucio Gutierrez, Lasso began the campaign unknown to most voters (he pulled just 4.6% in the March 2012 poll). However, Lasso and his team have launched aggressive efforts to <a href=\"http://www.telegrafo.com.ec/index.php?option=com_zoo&amp;task=item&amp;item_id=43322&amp;Itemid=2\">promote him in television and print media</a>. Thus far, with a focus on domestic issues and image cultivation, Lasso in particular has been able to start to close the gap with Correa, hoping to push out the other prospective opposition candidates and turn the contest into a two-horse race.</p> <p>This brings us back to the Julian Assange case, which has been used to great political effect by President Correa to redirect the nation's focus from the presidential campaign to a riveting legal and diplomatic affair of international significance. Each day that Assange and the asylum case dominates the airwaves is one fewer day for Lasso to introduce himself to voters and work to find a consensus platform for the opposition.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/world/americas/ecuador-to-let-assange-stay-in-its-embassy.html\">forceful anti-imperialist and anti-colonial rhetoric of Correa and Foreign Minister Pati\u00f1o</a> in the context of the UK's threat to remove diplomatic protections from the Ecuador Embassy in London have been couched in nationalistic terms for the Ecuadorian population. Essentially, Correa has wrapped himself in the flag \u2013 in a such a way that his conservative opponents are not able to criticize him effectively, lest they seem unpatriotic.</p> <p>This is a familiar approach for Correa. He used similar tactics back in 2010 when he declared that the police riot and strike represented an attempted coup d'etat. Stirring nationalist and populist furor, he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/01/ecuador-revolt-coup-rafael-correa\">shut down both a brewing internal rebellion among leftists within his party and efforts from the opposition on the right</a> to slow down his left-leaning reform agenda.</p> <p>Though the six months until February's vote is a long time in electoral politics, Ecuador's new elections law make the current period particularly important. According to the reforms passed in January, political speech in the media, such as campaign advertising, is <a href=\"http://cpj.org/2012/01/in-ecuador-reforms-restrict-election-coverage-for.php\">severely restricted for the final 90 days before election day</a>. In effect, it means that Guillermo Lasso and the opposition have only until November to make a serious dent in Correa's lead by way of campaign advertising.</p> <p>Therefore, the longer and more dramatic the Assange case is, and the longer Ecuador's diplomatic dispute with the UK and Sweden continues, the more the Ecuadorian election campaign will dwell on international affairs \u2013 a sphere the incumbent Correa dominates in relation to his opponents. With far fewer risks than the major electoral benefits it delivers, the diplomatic spat is clearly in Correa's political favor.</p>",
  "<p>The government is to pay compensation to the family of a 10-year-old Afghan boy who was bayoneted by a British soldier.</p> <p>Grenadier Guardsman Daniel Crook could not explain why he stabbed the boy in the kidneys in an unprovoked attack when he was hungover after a heavy session drinking vodka.</p> <p>Crook was jailed for 18 months and dismissed from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/british-army\" title=\"\">army</a>.</p> <p>The Ministry of Defence admitted the attack was \"appalling\" and has agreed to pay compensation. The amount has yet to be agreed.</p> <p>The boy's father has told the Guardian that his family has suffered financially as a result of the attack, while his son has missed months of school.</p> <p>Crook was convicted last year after he pleaded guilty to attacking in Helmand province, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\" title=\"\">Afghanistan</a>.</p> <p>The court martial heard that one evening in March 2010, he drunk a \"considerable quantity\" of vodka and became so \"drunk and incapable\" that he had to be treated by doctors overnight. Prosecutors told the court that the alcohol had been \"sent to him in a mineral water bottle contained in a welfare parcel\".</p> <p>At 9am the next day, his unit left him behind to go out on patrol. Crook followed his unit after arming himself with a pair of grenades and a bayonet. His rifle had been taken off him \"as a safety measure\".</p> <p>Not far from the checkpoint, Crook, still on his own, encountered Ghulam Nabi, then 10, who was on an errand for his father to collect yoghurt.</p> <p>His father, Shah Zada, said Crook&#xa0;ordered his son to stop. \"But he was just a little child and he didn't understand, otherwise he would have stopped his bicycle immediately,\" said the 72-year-old farmer.</p> <p>Crook \"took hold of the boy's shoulder and stabbed him in the region of his kidneys with his bayonet\", prosecutors from the Service Prosecuting Authority told the court martial. \"Crook felt the bayonet pierce the boy's skin, but did not see if he was bleeding,\" they added.</p> <p>Shortly afterwards, Crook found his unit and admitted he had stabbed a child. He later told military investigators on two occasions that he could not offer any explanation for what he did.</p> <p>The boy was taken to a hospital in Kandahar. His father said the British gave him a very small amount of money to pay for the medical treatment, adding that his son could not walk, or cycle to school for many months after the attack and found it difficult to lift weight.</p> <p>Zada said the attack had burdened the family financially as his son was unable to run errands or help to collect grass for their animals. Ghulam has a big scar on his back.</p> <p>He added that foreign troops were \"in Afghanistan to build the country and remove insurgents, not to stab a child\".</p> <p>The family's case was taken up by Birmingham-based law firm, <a href=\"http://www.publicinterestlawyers.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Public Interest Lawyers</a>, after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/dec/02/british-soldier-stabbed-afghan-boy\" title=\"\">the story was revealed in</a> the Guardian.</p> <p>Daniel Carey, from the firm, said: \"Our client is seeking compensation from the Ministry of Defence for the unprovoked attack on him. It is regrettable that medical assistance and adequate compensation were not provided earlier. In view of the ongoing proceedings we have no further comment at this stage.\"</p> <p>A MoD spokesman said: \"The MoD has accepted liability for this appalling incident and appropriate compensation will be paid on receipt of medical reports.</p> <p>\"Incidents of this kind are extremely rare but any allegations of ill treatment are investigated thoroughly. Protecting the Afghan civilian population is one of the UK's top priorities.

  "<p>While stock pickers fret about the social media \"bubble\" \u2013 witness the concern over the frailty of Groupon's daily deal business model and Facebook's share price \u2013 something more profound is taking place within business in the shape of a structural, cultural and philosophical realignment of the relationship between customer and companies. This has been highlighted in recent weeks by three separate but connected stories, all involving social media and airline customer service.</p> <p><a href=\"http://blog.seattlepi.com/airlinereporter/2012/08/09/updated-alaska-airlines-has-a-tough-week-%E2%80%93-were-they-treated-fairly/\" title=\"\">Alaska Airlines</a>, <a href=\"http://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2012/08/united-airlines-lost-my-friends-10-year-old-daughter-and-didnt-care.html\" title=\"\">United Airlines</a> and <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/markfidelman/2012/08/15/how-one-defective-social-media-campaign-spawned-millions-in-overcharges/2/\" title=\"\">Southwest Airlines</a> have recently all found themselves fighting a rearguard customer service battle, turbocharged by the real-time interaction of social media. In the case of each airline, social media served as the fast, cheap and out-of-control medium that escalated and amplified a specific customer service complaint.</p> <p>Southwest's woes stemmed from a computer glitch in processing payments for an online promotion. Some customers were charged multiple times and took to Facebook to let the world know. But in the case of both Alaska and United, the social media backlash came from people posting on blogs and Twitter about mistreatment of customers.</p> <p>Alaska Airlines was criticised for refusing to let a disabled man <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/alaska-airlines/update-on-our-redmond-passenger/10150961454476073\" title=\"\">board a flight</a> because airline staff thought he was drunk. United found itself again in the social media crosshairs over its treatment of <a href=\"http://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2012/08/united-airlines-lost-my-friends-10-year-old-daughter-and-didnt-care.html\" title=\"\">10-year old Phoebe Klebahn</a>, an unaccompanied minor who the airline lost at Chicago O'Hare airport while it was meant to be helping her reach a summer camp in Michigan.</p> <p>United took a battering a few years ago after musician Dave Carroll, memorably took to YouTube to complain about the airline failing to compensate him for a <a href=\"http://socialmediainfluence.com/2012/04/12/fail-no-19-united-airliness-social-media-mistake/\" title=\"\">broken guitar</a>. The mislaid child episode, compounded by the uncaring, clueless outsourced customer service experienced by Phoebe's parents as they tried to locate their missing daughter could have been far worse for the airline had the Klebahn's been communicating using social media in real time.</p> <p>Instead, in what must have been a great relief for United, the Klebahns chose to write a private letter of complaint to the airline's CEO but still, United managed to drop the ball. They failed to reply until the family went to a <a href=\"http://www.dianedwyer.net/\" title=\"\">local TV reporter</a> with the story of their ordeal and handed a copy of the letter to prominent business blogger, Bob Sutton. Well you can guess what happened next.</p> <p>With social media lighting up about the episode and NBC news airing the story, United had to respond. First, an executive called the family to placate them before seeking to squash highly critical comments online, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/united/response-to-unaccompanied-minor-issue/438098452894369\" title=\"\">posting a statement</a> on Facebook saying:</p> <p><em>We appreciate and understand everyone's concerns over this situation, please know we have reached out directly to the Klebahn family to apologise and are conducting an on-going investigation. The service they describe is not the service we aim to deliver. We are doing a thorough investigation into what happened and into our procedures to see how we may continually improve.</em></p> <p>Obviously airlines like United don't lose children every day. Indeed there are plenty of <a href=\"http://www.meandmine.org/2012/sitting-in-seat-7e-i-do-believe-was-meant-to-be/\" title=\"\">social media anecdotes</a>, shared on blogs and Twitter, describing the kind and gracious attitude of United employees. But episodes like that of Phoebe Klebahn and the Alaska Airlines passenger often have an eureka effect with companies, revealing weaknesses in process, communication and corporate culture.</p> <p>That's why social media is not just reinventing how companies provide customer service but also providing opportunities for sustainability executives to shape the future business. Anyone in charge of a corporate social media account will attest that customers' rantings on Facebook and Twitter et al can be unpleasant and tricky to manage. Cut through the vitriol though, and often there are some home truths that companies can learn from if they want to demonstrate true sustainability.</p> <p>Already, many companies are encouraging PR, marketing and even product development to learn from online customer feedback. Sustainability professionals should also be part of this greater business discussion. They may have longer term goals than the reactive world of customer service, but their philosophy should be the same \u2013 that creating stronger customer and community ties will help maintain and build a better company.</p> <p>Just listen to those social media commentators.

  "<p>The Fire Brigades Union has warned that public safety is being put at risk by the privatisation of public services after it emerged that the owner of London and Lincoln's fire engines had sold its UK fleet for \u00a32.</p> <p>AssetCo said it had sold its UK fire-engine leasing and maintenance business because the contracts were \"based on a flawed business and financial structure\". The business owns the leasing and maintenance contracts for the two fire authorities and has been sold to the private-equity firm AB&amp;A Investments. AssetCo said the business made a loss of \u00a316.5m in the 18 months to 30 September 2011 on a turnover of \u00a333.5m.</p> <p>\"The board and senior management are now able to focus on creating shareholder value through the company's restructured business model, positioning AssetCo as a provider of outsourced fire and rescue operations,\" the firm said, adding that it operates a, referring to its contract in the United Arab Emirates where it also provides training for staff, alongside fire engines and maintenance. It said it was \"pursuing further opportunities in the Middle East\".</p> <p>AssetCo was established in 2001 after winning a 20-year private finance initiative contract from the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority that included owning and managing vehicles.</p> <p>The assistant general secretary to the FBU, Andy Dark, warned, however, that \"national resilience and public safety\" were at risk. He added: \"These are public assets over which the London fire brigade and the elected politicians have no control. They must be brought back into public ownership under direct local authority control.\"</p> <p>Dark said the \"carving up\" of emergency services had to end. \"The fire service is made up of the firefighters and the fire engines which carry the kit. The London fire brigade doesn't own the fire engines or the kit and has no ability to stop the assets being sold on from firm to firm.\"</p> <p>The commissioner of the London Fire Brigade, Ron Dobson, said there would be no negative impact on public safety. \"The sale of AssetCo's UK interests has no effect whatsoever on the London fire brigade or its fire engines, which continue to be maintained and available as usual.</p> <p>I have met with the new owners of AssetCo London, AB&amp;A Investments Limited, and received every assurance that it is committed to maintaining and improving the service the London fire brigade receives.\"Unite's assistant general secretary, Gail Cartmail, said the deal evoked parallels with the G4S Olympic security contract and the dangers of privatising public services. Unite has members in the ambulance and police services. \"It should serve as a lesson on why the government should halt the privatisation of some of the country's key public assets.</p> <p>\"Fire engines, which should be in public hands, are now in the hands of private equity.</p> <p>Now even core parts of the police force, including crime investigation are up for grabs.

(In covering the trial live, CNN and the BBC have broadcast what essentially amount to long infomercials against investing in, visiting and generally dealing with Russia).</p> <p>Clueless western supporters have glommed on to the story at its most black and white, imposing easy narratives on it and making a balaclava look as cute as a hemp tote. (Melena Ryzik's piece in the New York Times on Friday marks the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/18/arts/music/in-new-york-a-show-of-solidarity-for-russian-punk-band.html\" title=\"\">beginning of a subtle backlash</a>: in her dry description of a Pussy Riot benefit at New York's hip Ace Hotel, the case is seen as a magnet for vapid celebs and people who unironically use the word \"shero\").</p> <p>Finally, the women's defence team, especially the lawyer Mark Feygin, proved extraordinarily capable of stooping to whatever level the other side had decided to drag the discussion. On Thursday morning, for instance, Feygin decided to \"address critics\" on his blog by posting his work ID (to prove his professionalism) and, more disturbingly, his mother's birth certificate (to prove that he is not a Jew, thus affirming that the opposite would have been a liability).</p> <p>The only professionals anywhere in sight are Pussy Riot themselves. From their name, perfectly pitched to both shock and attract the western media, to their instantly recognisable look; from their message (concise bursts of feminist agitprop with just enough of a tune to pass as a song), to their method of distributing this message via social networks; from their initial punk posturing in interviews, to their pointedly academic statements to the court, which no less than David Remnick called \"a kind of instant classic in the anthology of dissidence\"; these women, and they alone in this mess, know exactly what they are doing.</p> <p>Minutes after the verdict, the band released a new single, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2012/aug/17/pussy-riot-release-new-single-video?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Putin Lights Up the Fires</a>, exclusively through the Guardian. It is notably more melodic than their previous work.</p> <p>In fact, such PR precision may even open up a slightly icky discussion of whether, in the meta-artwork that is Pussy Riot's story, imprisonment is an integral part. (The collective were once temporarily excommunicated from their parent art group, Voina, for allegedly planning the arrest of a group's member as a way of amplifying the message).</p> <p>But now is not the time for that discussion. Nuance can come later. When you trim away everything else, three young women will spend two years in jail for dancing in a church.</p> <p>And the depths of vengeful backwardness that their case has teased out of the Russian soil have helped make a dubious art project into a great one: one capable of changing the society that tried to stifle it.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Michael Idov is editor-in-chief of GQ Russia</em></p>",

  "<p>Stoke are arguably the most successful promoted side of recent years. Since joining the Premier League in 2008 the Potters have never been in a relegation battle, and Tony Pulis is keen to ensure this season is no different. \"Gradually we're putting things into place that this football club could never have dreamed of and we mustn't get too greedy. Staying in the Premier League is our target,\" he said. Newly promoted Reading will be looking to emulate their opponents' top-flight staying power, but manager Brian McDermott may find himself with a tough task on his hands. New signing Pavel Pogrebnyak could be key \u2013 the Russian forward scored a goal every other game during his loan spell at Fulham last season and the Royals will hope he can replicate that form in 2012-13. <strong>Alex Finnis</strong></p> <p><strong>Venue</strong> Madejski Stadium, Saturday 3pm</p> <p><strong>Tickets </strong>\u00a332-34 (0844 249 1871)</p> <p><strong>Last season </strong>n/a</p> <p><strong>Referee </strong>Kevin Friend</p> <p><strong>Last season's matches</strong> 20 <strong>Y</strong>76, <strong>R</strong>1, 3.85 cards per game</p> <p><strong>Odds </strong>Reading 7-5 Stoke 2-1 Draw 12-5</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394861697\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/8/17/1345217610626/Reading-v-Stoke-City-001.jpg\" alt=\"Reading v Stoke City\" width=\"460\" height=\"650\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reading v Stoke City: Probable starters in bold, contenders in light.

  "<p>This week I was forced to face the truth that my much-loved and aged family dog was unnecessarily suffering as a result of a painful illness. I asked the vet to call at home \u2013 I&#xa0;thought it was right to end my dog's life, and wanted her to die in familiar surroundings. I reasoned that as a responsible pet owner, it could not be fair to let her go on as she was; moribund and miserable.</p> <p>It is often said, on seeing someone suffer a long and painful illness, that we would not let an animal suffer in this way. But as terrible as human suffering can be, there is of course no meaningful comparison to be drawn between the morality of ending the lives of animals and people except perhaps for this: how relatively easy it is for us to convince ourselves that we are doing the right thing. That matters in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/assisted-suicide\" title=\"\">the debate about assisted suicide</a> as well as euthanasia.</p> <p>In my time as a doctor, I cared for many people who were dying. It was not uncommon, during a degenerative illness or cancer, for someone to ask me to help them to end their lives. Depression and hopelessness are a normal part of coming to terms with dying or a debilitating illness. During that time most people would have been able to&#xa0;weigh up their choices and have the capacity to decide whether they wanted to end their lives. But I also witnessed most of those same people come through the depression to reach a kind of peace before they died. Had it been easy and painless to take their own lives, how many would have been denied the chance to come through a sometimes lengthy adjustment?</p> <p>It isn't just the religious lobby that is opposed to a change in the law to allow assisted suicide. I have no faith banner to raise, and as a former doctor I know there are conditions for which I might at some point wish to end my life. Despite this, I don't believe I should have a right to make a doctor complicit in that decision.</p> <p>People with capacity should have a right to make decisions for themselves \u2013 even if we don't agree with them, except where those decisions harm others. Assisted suicide <em>does</em> harm others: it harms the doctors who take on the responsibility for killing their patients. There is a vast difference between the moral responsibility in doctors withholding treatment that will end life and actively prescribing with the primary intent to ensure death. Failed attempts and the methods used may be distressing, but that does not justify the right to a clinically delivered death, which would fundamentally change the relationship between doctors and their patients and threaten to change the way society weighs the value of human life.</p> <p>If society normalises such decisions about life and death, how easy would it be to slide from believing it acceptable to allow doctors to prescribe lethal cocktails for their patients in exceptional circumstances to feeling it strange or even immoral that such patients be allowed to live? There is also an unacceptable risk that a right to die could lead to the seriously ill or severely disabled feeling that they had a \"duty\" to die rather than burden their family or carers.</p> <p>I know that even with the very best care in a hospice, the final weeks or months for some conditions can be distressing and painful. For that reason we should make it more straightforward for people and those they entrust to make decisions on their behalf, so that they are able to refuse active, life-prolonging interventions. We could also do much more to relieve distress by continuing to improve the network of palliative care teams delivering care and support closer to home. The current <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nwIWgXlZm0&amp;feature=related\" title=\"\">guidelines set out by Keir Starmer</a> regarding the prosecution of those who assist others to take their own lives are humane and sensible; we should keep them.</p> <p>And as for my faithful old friend; as I tearfully ushered the vet into the sitting room, my dog stirred, wagged her tail and trotted into the kitchen to take her first drink in days. She has now recovered. Please do not think I am suggesting any moral equivalence or trivialising but this is the final danger: doctors do not always get it right.</p>",
  "<p>Frankel will be the star of the show at York's Ebor meeting this week but he may not be the only beast capable of drawing gasps from the crowd. Pearl Secret, a flashy chestnut, is no household name yet and is based near unglamorous Northallerton with a 66-year-old trainer who most racegoers would struggle to recognise, but he is unbeaten and will finally get his chance on the big stage in Friday's Nunthorpe Stakes.</p> <p>\"He's quite an exciting horse,\" says David Barron, the trainer in question, with deliberate restraint. \"Here, in his work, he doesn't leave you in any doubt about his ability. It's hard to match one generation against another but I wouldn't think I've had too many better.\"</p> <p>So far, the three-year-old has been confined to just four starts, two of them over the same course and distance as Friday's race. His greatest test has been a Listed race at Sandown, when he was asked to do no more than was necessary by Richard Hughes and won by just a neck, showing obvious promise of much better to come.</p> <p>That's why, even after so little exposure, Pearl Secret is the 6-1 second-favourite for a Group One like the Nunthorpe. \"We're shooting at stars with him,\" Barron says. \"Horses need to learn to compete in this type of contest and it'll be very difficult for him. We may come through it and I hope we do but really this is another stepping stone in his career. It's one hell of an ask.</p> <p>\"He will almost certainly be beaten at some stage. I don't think we're going to do a Frankel and win every time.\"</p> <p>Barron knows about fast horses. Over the past five seasons, he has had more runners over five and six furlongs than at all other distances combined, by a significant margin. He wins sprint races at a 17% strike-rate and any punters following him blindly have made an 18% profit on turnover since 2008.</p> <p>His recent standard-bearers have included Waffle, second in the Wokingham, Hitchens, third in the July Cup, and Poet's Place, winner of the Portland. A bigger talent than any of those was Coastal Bluff, who won the Stewards' and the Ayr Gold Cups in 1996 before dead-heating for first in the Nunthorpe the following year.</p> <p>The grey is remembered as terribly unlucky not to have won outright that day, his bit having snapped just a few strides from the starting stalls, leaving Kevin Darley with next to no control over him. Barron, however, is not inclined to dwell on what might have been.</p> <p>\"Who will ever know? The bit was flapping against his chest. I suppose it might have frightened the life out of him. He might have run faster than he'd ever done in his life!\"</p> <p>The trainer will not take the bait when it is suggested that the Nunthorpe should, in all justice, provide him with a change of luck this week. \"Racing owes me nothing,\" he says with heavy emphasis, closing the door on any idea that he might be feeling sorry for himself at this distance in time.</p> <p>Until Pearl Secret came along, Barron's 40-year career had not attracted the attention of the sort of big-spending owner who can really raise a trainer's profile. But the bloodstock agent David Redvers, who paid \u00a390,000 for the colt on behalf of Sheikh Fahad at a Doncaster auction in April last year, immediately sought out the Yorkshireman to ask if he had room in his yard for one more.</p> <p>\"I think his results have been outstanding, particularly with speed horses,\" Redvers says. \"We like using the smaller trainers and spreading our horses around. It's about spreading the risk, we don't want all our eggs in one basket. But also there are a lot of good trainers around who don't get the opportunities they deserve. Sheikh Fahad and I would like to give some of those guys a chance.\"</p> <p>Redvers remembers Pearl Secret clocking \"a spectacularly fast time in very easy fashion\" when asked to show his worth to potential buyers last year. \"I felt he was the standout in that sale and it's rather nice to be proven right.\" He describes him as \"a bull of a horse\" who possibly has \"a bit too much weight about him\". \"David's been patient with him and he should make an outstanding four-year-old.\"</p> <p>For his part, Barron is clearly gratified to be trusted with such a useful prospect. \"We don't spend much at the sales and we've been lucky enough to always come up with one or two decent animals. Horses like this one cost a bit. That's no guarantee, of course.\"</p>",
  "<p>An Afghan soldier and police officer have turned their guns on foreign troops they work with, killing two and injuring several others, hours after the Taliban's leader boasted about his fighters' infiltration of government security forces and called for more attacks.</p> <p>Two US special forces soldiers were killed in western Farah province by a newly recruited member of the Afghan Local Police, shortly after they handed him a gun during an inauguration ceremony.</p> <p>\"As soon as they gave the weapon to Ismail to begin training, suddenly he took the gun and opened fire toward the US soldiers,\" Farah provincial police chief Agha Noor Kemtoz told the Associated Press.</p> <p>Hours later, in a volatile corner of southern Kandahar province, an Afghan soldier opened fire on a group of Nato troops, but was shot before he could kill anyone, said Nato spokesman Major Martin Crighton. The attacker later died of his wounds.</p> <p>It was the second Friday in a row that there have been \"insider attacks\" on foreign soldiers. Last Friday, six US troops were killed, and there were other non-fatal attacks this week. Last Saturday, an Afghan policeman also shot dead nine of his fellow officers.</p> <p>Afghan and Nato officials have been desperately searching for a way to staunch the growing tide of these shootings, which are badly damaging morale on the critical mission to train Afghan forces as foreigners head home.</p> <p>There are intelligence agents undercover in many Afghan army units to seek out insurgent sympathisers, and Nato has created a system of \"guardian angels\" \u2013 soldiers who watch over fellow troops when they are with armed Afghan forces.</p> <p>Even so, the attacks have been increasing, with 31 this year so far, compared with 21 in all of 2011. They have killed 39 people, while in all of last year 35 died.</p> <p>The attacks were welcomed by Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Omar in his annual message marking Eid al-Fitr, the end of the fasting month of Ramadan. He also called on more security forces to turn against their allies.</p> <p>\"Mujahideen have cleverly infiltrated in the ranks of the enemy according to the plan given to them last year ... they easily carry out decisive and co-ordinated attacks, inflicting heavy losses,\" the message, published online in English translation, said. \"We expect others to display the same boldness and spirit.\"</p> <p>The leader of Nato and US forces in Afghanistan, General John Allen, attacked the Taliban statement as \"insane language\", and described the police and soldiers who turn on their allies as \"the worst of humanity \u2026 Mullah Omar has issued an unmistakable message of death, hate and hopelessness for the Afghan people\".</p> <p>Nato commanders argue that the attackers account for the tiniest portion of security forces, now more than 300,000 strong, and say many are driven by personal grudges rather than ideology.</p> <p>But infiltration might be easier to tackle systematically than the chance collision of personal problems and anger at western troops. And the shooters' motivation has no bearing on how the attacks affect sentiment both in Afghanistan and the countries that lose soldiers.</p>",
  "<p>The other day when I tweeted my distaste for the latest Kylie Minogue single (a form of sacrilege in some circles) one of my followers replied with one of my least favorite phrases: \"We're going to revoke your gay card.\" Not only is this trite rejoinder (thanks to Ellen DeGeneres, we've been joking about earning toasters for nearly 15 years now) but it maintains the illusion that one must like certain things in order to be gay. </p> <p>There's no such thing as a gay monolith. There are as many ways to be gay as there are colors in the rainbow (now who is being easy and glib?). Dishing out gay cards is like telling people they aren't allowed to be gay because they haven't seen the requisite number of Glee episodes. </p> <p>But, then again, maybe they gay community needs some sort of shared experience \u2013&#xa0;outside of the experience of falling in love with a member of the same sex \u2013 to bring us together. Gay men and women don't share a place of origin, skin color, socio-economic class, religion, or anything else that would typify their experience. </p> <p>In his new book, How to Be Gay, professor David M Halperin says: \"Gayness is not a state or condition. It's a mode of perception, an attitude, an ethos: in short, it is a practice.\" As the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/08/books/how-to-be-gay-by-david-m-halperin.html\">review of his book points out</a>, the thing that really brings gay people together is their culture. </p> <p>So in this age of mainstreaming, where gay men come out of the closet not to attend dinner parties of catty queens like themselves and the cast of Boys in the Band but to a room of welcoming members of society both straight and gay, how can we form a culture of our own? If there are a million ways to be gay, can we settle on a few key experiences every gay man should experience to draw them together? </p> <p>Here are my suggestions:</p> <h2>1. Have a diva</h2> <p>Everyone needs a Kylie, even if you think Time Bomb is kind of a crappy song. Having a strong female icon is somehow central to the gay identity (for more on that, pick up Halperin's book) and harkens back to the darkest days of gay identity when these troubled broads were the closest thing you could find to a representation of gay life. The diva of choice doesn't need to be one of the familiar one-named ladies of song (Madonna, Cher, Judy, Liza, Barbra, Mariah, Gaga, and both Bettes), it can be anyone from Joni Mitchell to Courtney Love, Diana Vreeland to Patsy Stone, Hilary Clinton to Michelle Obama. Just pick one, and never ever ever ever leave her. </p> <h2>2. Dress in drag</h2> <p>Even if it's just once for Halloween, go out in the world wearing the clothing of the opposite gender. It will it unleash a personality you didn't even know you had in you and it will make you OK with femininity. So many gay men are afraid of even the slightest bit of swish being detected. \"No fems,\" has been branded into all of our mentality. But one night when the <em>femme</em> is in total control will never make you fear it again. And it will put you in touch with the brave bottle throwers who started the Stonewall Riots back in the day. </p> <h2>3. Cruise </h2> <p>Everyone used to know to glance over your shoulder after three steps if you were interested in that sexy stranger on the sidewalk. There was a complex network of looks and signals that men used to use to attract each other, something that made gay men much more attuned to body language and perceptive than our straight counterparts. Learn how to do that. Not only will it improve your gay experience, but the way you interact with everyone. Street cruising is mostly dead \u2013 no, it can't be done on Grindr \u2013 but a trip to a bath house will teach you all you ever need to know. </p> <h2>4. Know about poppers</h2> <p>If only so people will get your jokes about Rush and Jungle Juice, know what poppers are. You don't have to use them, but it's one secret we've kept from most of the gay community for decades so we have to keep it going. It's our version of Colonel Sanders' secret recipe. </p> <h2>5. Protest</h2> <p>Get out there with a picket sign and some anger and fight for your rights. Even before Stonewall we have a long history of fighting the man, and that should never die. You can collect signatures for marriage equality or you can join an Occupy protest and fight income inequality, but never stop fighting. And if PDA (public displays of agitation) aren't your thing, there are plenty of causes that need fundraising, which can easily be done over brunch (a gay art that somehow is not on this list). </p> <h2>6. Go to Pride</h2> <p>Standing out in the hot June sun can sure be a drag (all puns intended) but everyone should experience the depth and breadth of the community at this event at least once. See the people outside of your social circle, the tourists from a far, and those people who wouldn't mix with in a million gay years. And where else are you going to see Dykes on Bikes anyway? </p> <h2>7. Develop a gaydar</h2> <p>This sense of being able to find other homosexuals in the given area isn't inborn like a sense of direction or ESP. No, it must be acquired through years of hard work and figuring out just which clues are going to give guys away. (Even then it's still not infallible whenever European tourists are around.) But it's essential. Not only will it help you determine when you're in a safe space with others of your kind, it will also direct you to which clerk to flirt with for a discount and which flight attendant to wink at for a free tiny bottle of vodka. </p> <h2>8. Appreciate camp </h2> <p>It's everything from Showgirls and Mommie Dearest to John Waters and your aunt Nancy who loves to show up at family events with lipstick on her teeth and do her Charo impersonation. Yes, before \"hipsters\" ironically co-opted things that were awful, gay men invented camp and it has pervaded our aesthetic. In some respects it's about loving an outsider and wanting to embrace it even while disparaging the things that make it amazing. Much like the supreme court's definition of pornography, it's hard to define camp but we all know it when we see it. And if you don't know it, then you're just another sincere mark for all the camp connoisseurs out there. </p> <h2>9. Visit the Aids quilt</h2> <p>Aids nearly wiped out a generation of gay men. Many gay men coming of age now know this intellectually, but they have no clue about the emotional cost of losing all of their friends slowly but surely to a disease or being forced to live with the diagnosis as a death sentence. While the quilt is now a shrine to everyone who has died of the disease, and not just gay men, it is the closest thing we have to a museum and the best way to document all the lives that have past. We owe it to them not to be forgotten. </p> <h2>10. Come out</h2> <p>In our age of Gay Straight Alliances in schools and celebrities who live in a perpetual glass closet without ever making a final announcement, coming out seems it's going out of style. \"Why should gay people have to come when straight people don't?\" While in some distant gaytopia that might come to pass but until then it's probably the only unifying experience every gay person has. </p> <p>We all have a coming out story, whether it was when your mom says she knew already, your father stopped talking to you, or your boss just didn't care and told you to go back to your desk. No matter what else you may or may not have in common with another gay person, you can always fall back on this. It's like talking about the weather, but far more interesting, and often with more tears.</p>",
  "<p>It's been almost a year now since I returned from maternity leave to my <a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dis/people/melissaterras\" title=\"\">full time job as an academic at UCL</a>. At the time, I had three children aged three and under ('The Boy', and 'The Boys' - fraternal twins) and since then, hardly a week goes by without someone commenting on the fact that I am Superwoman.</p> <p>So I thought I would explain how I balance having a fairly large family of small people and academia; partly to show that it can be done and partly to show that I am not superwoman but incredibly lucky.</p> <p><strong>I'm not superwoman ... I have a supportive partner.</strong> The most important piece of advice I can give to anyone contemplating having a career and a family is choose the right person to do it with. It takes two to tango, and the raising of a family should not just be the responsibility of the mother. Neither should looking after the household be. Feminism begins at home, folks: share chores and childcare equally. To boot, my husband works from home which means he is on hand to do nursery drop off and pick up.</p> <p><strong>I'm not superwoman ... I have flexible working hours.</strong> Long academic working hours are legendary. But so are their flexibility. After The Boy, I looked after him at home one day during the working week, and no-one batted an eyelid as I made up the hours in evenings. I regularly work in the evenings so I can spend more time with all my boys through the week (though I think missing bedtime about once a week, to go to work events, is acceptable). I never work weekends, though, unless I am at a conference.</p> <p><strong>I'm not superwoman ... I don't work in a lab-based discipline.</strong> One or two days a week I work from home which means I keep on top of email and working documents, plus can power through the laundry backlog in lunch and coffee breaks. I'm not sure how I would cope with having to be in a lab from 9am to 5pm every day. All academic jobs are not created equal, but the ones which are flexible ... man, are they flexible.</p> <p><strong>I'm not superwoman ... I can afford help around the home.</strong> Despite our best efforts, we have a cleaner come in for two hours a week to deep clean the bathrooms, scrub all the floors, and hoover throughout the house. But this subject brings up an issue I also don't understand: guilt about paying for extra help. There shouldn't be any, as long as you pay decent rates, pay for holidays, and don't treat your cleaner like ... dirt.</p> <p><strong>I'm not superwoman ... I take as many shortcuts as possible.</strong> I haven't ironed anything since 2003. I'm not spending hours of my time making things flat just so that they can get crumpled again when worn. No-one has noticed yet (have you?). Make as many short cuts around housework and your home as you can. I think efficiency, rather than show-home.</p> <p><strong>I'm not superwoman ... I use all the technology I can to make this easy.</strong> The postman hates us with all the parcels off eBay; we use lots of shared calendars online to plan everything and keep track of the movements and needs of two adults, three small people, and a cat; I <a href=\"http://twitter.com/melissaterras\" title=\"\">tweet</a>, shop, and email when I'm waiting on trains. When I'm away with work I speak to the boys on video chat as often as I can. Make technology your friend.</p> <p><strong>I'm not superwoman ... I travel a lot with work.</strong> This may sound like an oxymoron, but not only do I get a couple of good nights sleep, I tend to work like a demon. Room service, and work till midnight. I get loads done in hotel rooms.</p> <p><strong>I'm not superwoman ... I live near family and friends.</strong> My mother-in-law moved to be closer to us shortly after the twins arrived. This is wonderful for the boys \u2013 getting to see their grandmother often \u2013 but also extremely helpful when illness strikes. The Boys got chicken pox the week I was giving a plenary in Paris. Mother-in-law stepped in to be the other pair of hands while I was away. It comes with some drawbacks but on balance, having family nearby makes caring for children, and dealing with the chaos that that often brings, much easier.</p> <p><strong>I'm not superwoman ... I work incredibly hard.</strong> I do work long hours, but I've found that, if anything, motherhood has made me much more focused, and I take my career much more seriously: if I'm going away from the family then every minute is generally filled up with tasks.</p> <p>So there you have it. You'll spot that I haven't mentioned 'work-life balance'. I don't believe in it. There are only 24 hours in a day, and it's all my life. My work is my life, my home is my life, my family is my life and my addiction to mid-century Belgian ceramics on eBay is also my life. A confluence of luck, good choices, hard work, and support have meant that \u2013 whisper it \u2013 it's not terribly stressful to be an academic working mother, for me at least.</p> <p>It would be much, much harder work to stay at home looking after three small boys day in, day out. Believe me, I've done it.</p> <p><em>Melissa Terras is the reader in electronic communication in the department of information studies at </em><a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>University College London</em></a><em>, and co-director of the recently founded </em><a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/\" title=\"\"><em>UCL Centre for Digital Humanities</em></a><em>.

  "<p>Resident Evil is back. No, I mean <em>really</em> back. While Resident Evil 4 changed the old recipe in a brutal yet considered way, the fifth title seemed to mangle the whole franchise into a sub-standard sun-burned shooter. Resident Evil 6, however, wants to have its slice of undead gore cake and eat it. </p> <p>The game's interesting structure follows three sets of characters on three very different quests through a zombie-infected world. There's Chris Redfield breaking out the blast-'em-up action in China, while Jake Muller, son of Resi antagonist Albert Wesker goes on the run in Eastern Europe in a sort of action adventure romp. And then there's Leon Kennedy, back in the US and facing his own infected outbreak in the traditional Resident Evil form. Having played a section of his story, it seems Capcom has truly rediscovered the essence of the survival horror genre. </p> <p>In this section Leon and his partner Helena must escape from a college campus where a zombifying gas has infected just about the entire student body. As soon as the demo begins it's clear this is classic Resident Evil fare. We're in a dingy cellar room, poorly lit and filled with rubbish. Leon's footsteps echo loudly and every once in a while a strange noise makes him flinch and look around. Was it a cry? A growl? We don't know, but our view of the room is restricted and the tension cranks up.</p> <p>So up the creaking steps Leon goes, out into a corridor, littered with more trash and smeared with blood. We're back, at least in terms of dense atmosphere and crushing inevitability, to the mansion in Resident Evil 1. And I might be over-reading it, but I'm sure the way that Leon slowly pushes each huge wooden door open is a reference to the old loading screens between locations in the first title. </p> <p>Leon makes his way gingerly into a tiered lecture theatre \u2013 bathed in shadow and seemingly deserted. Then, suddenly and subtly, a drink can rolls down the steps onto the central floor. Immediately from the gloom, a zombie rises, then another. It's game on. Leon has a handgun, as does Helena, but \u2013 guess what \u2013 ammo is in very short supply. The one concession to modern tastes is the melee element: while in the first Resi titles taking on a zombie in hand-to-hand combat was always a nightmarishly risky endeavour, Kennedy is a high-kicking hard guy, who can knock the undead down then quickly stamp on their fetid faces. There are also short QTE sequences, allowing more devestating and visually impressive attacks.</p> <p>As an AI character, Helena tends to hang back prefering to avoid and shoot, rather than wade in with blows. It's a good idea, meaning that she never puts herself into unncessarily risky situations.</p> <p>As monsters are disptached, Leon picks up skill points, which can be used throughout the game to upgrade characters and weapons. Rooms also contain herbs and bullets, as well as useful pieces of information. Leon and Helena don't talk much, but they trade theories as they move. In the background a discordant organ soundtrack plays, or there's silence punctuated only by breathing sounds. </p> <p>Cleverly, although it's a 3D environment with a dynamic camera, there's still an angular, expressionistic feel to each room, like the weird fixed camera angles in the first Resi titles. Often objects or shadows restrict your view, or you'll catch glimpses of movement through doorways \u2013 Capcom has remembered how to be subtle and artful; how to use the tricks of Hitchcock and Romero to hint at terror while restricting our ability to properly see or deal with it. At times when groups of zombies come in, I often get stuck trying to turn Leon between the undead aggressors, and far from being a flaw, it once again takes me back to the tension and vulnerabiity of Resident Evil 1 and 2.</p> <p>Outside, the campus is crawling with the undead \u2013 we need to open a security gate but the key is in a staff house and when we go in, zombies suddenly mount an attack on the building crawling in through the windows in a reference to the classic stand-off scene in Resident Evil 4. It's bloody, nerve-wracking stuff, and when we finally grab the key, it's all bout navigating through the darkened landscape to get to that gate and to freedom. </p> <p>From here, there's a great denoument. Leon and Helena dive into a police car and screech away, heading for a cathedral, until another zombie attack sends the car spinning off the road. This is how Resi has always worked \u2013 slowly but surely building the atmopshere to firestorms of destructive action. I can't wait to see the end-of-level monsters in this one. </p> <p>Best of all, I love the way this level plays with the memories and expectations of longtime Resi fans. It's not only those door-opening sequences; there are also sections that comment on how the first games made you run through the same sections time and time again; only here, new zombies awaken to make the return trip more dangerous. It also looks as though zombie dogs will be back, no doubt smashing through windows and giving us all heart failure once again. Everything is both familiar and new. It is marvelous fun. </p> <p>It will be fascinating to see how all this fits together. Apparently each of the three sections is its own adventure, though the stories interconnect. They're all around ten hours long, and finishing them unlocks an extra Ada Wong story, which itself is another ten hours. On top of this, there are multiplayer modes, as well as a new social layer, RE.Net, which compares player stats and achievements, and lets you unlock extra costumes and other goodies. </p> <p>I played Leon's quest in single-player, and it'll be fascinating to see if the old skool fear is retained with a co-op partner. It's the same thing people are worrying about with Dead Space 3, though here it feels like co-operating is subservient to the main motivation \u2013 trying to get out, trying not to be eaten, trying not to be scared. Resident Evil has always been about the terror of transmogrification and decay \u2013 it was at its best when it did this in a mannered, manipulative way. Leon's story is hitting those same old nerves, those same fear points. We are residents of evil once again.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Resident Evil 6 will be released on PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 in October</em></p>",
  "<p>Human rights groups have warned of a crackdown on relatives and friends of a veteran Chinese activists who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/08/china-police-detain-tiananmen-veteran-relatives\" title=\"\">questioned his strange death</a>, after one was arrested for inciting subversion of state power.</p> <p>They believe Zhu Chengzhi is being punished for flagging the suspicious circumstances of his friend Li Wangyang's death.</p> <p>Li was found dead in his hospital room in June, two days after the anniversary of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989. He had served more than two decades in jail for his role in campaigning for workers' rights before he was released last year.</p> <p>Officials in Shaoyang, Hunan province, initially said he had killed himself, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/15/china-inquiry-tiananmen-death\" title=\"\">but later described his death as an accident</a>.</p> <p>Police promised to investigate after thousands signed an online petition and tens of thousands demonstrated in Hong Kong, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/13/chinese-police-claims-dissident-suicide\" title=\"\">concluded again</a> that it was suicide.</p> <p>Relatives and friends said Li showed no signs he was suicidal, that his feet were on the floor when he was found and that they believed him physically incapable of hanging himself because of his poor health.</p> <p>\"In the early stages, when Hunan provincial authorities agreed to conduct an investigation and make public their findings, we were somewhat encouraged. [Now they have] resorted to the same old tactics of closing the case by trampling on the rights of the family and others,\" said Catherine Baber, director of Amnesty International's Asia-Pacific programme.</p> <p>\"This is a horrific case. After two decades in prison, Li Wangyang was left with his health devastated. He died in highly suspicious circumstances under state care. For his family to disappear and now for his friend to be prosecuted, it appears as a whistleblower, is truly shocking.\"</p> <p>Friends have been unable to contact <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/08/china-police-detain-tiananmen-veteran-relatives\" title=\"\">Li's sister and brother-in-law</a> since shortly after his death. Officials have said the couple have chosen not to speak to people. Other activists were detained.</p> <p>\"Zhu's arrest has ripped away any remaining pretence of official justice for Li. Instead of launching a 'transparent' inquiry as the government had originally promised, it has gone after Li's family and friends, silencing and punishing them,\" said Wang Songlian of the Chinese Human Rights Defenders Network (CHRD).</p> <p>Zhu was first held in June, but his wife has now been told he has been formally arrested. Inciting subversion of state power, a charge often used against activists and dissidents, carries a jail term of up to 15 years, although in practice sentences rarely exceed 10 years.</p> <p>CHRD said Zhu is held at the Shaoyang city detention centre, where phone calls rang unanswered. Police referred queries to a number that was out of service.</p> <p>One account suggested Zhu was arrested because he took pictures of the death scene and shared them online.</p> <p>The South China Morning Post, quoting another activist, said Zhu was initially detained because he refused to sign a statement disowning comments he made questioning the official account of Li's death.</p> <p>Immediately after his friend died, he told the Hong Kong newspaper: \"I simply don't think it was a suicide because Li was the kind of guy who would never commit suicide, even if a knife was held against his neck.\"</p>",
  "<p>If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, the members of UK Uncut must be feeling pretty bashful this week. In an apparent tribute to the social media savvy campaigning group, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is using photo-sharing website Flickr <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/16/uk-most-wanted-tax-dodgers-published\" title=\"\">to publish images of the UK's 20 most-wanted tax evaders</a>. Not so long ago, Flickr's photostreams were adorned with protesters getting dragged out of Topshop by unforgiving rozzers. Now they are home to the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmrcgovuk\" title=\"\">sinister mugshots of individuals</a> HMRC alleges have committed tax fraud worth millions.</p> <p>There is a certain irony to the fact that HMRC is capitalising on the wave of popular anger surrounding tax avoidance and evasion. It was, after all, HMRC's own ineptitude which managed to create that popular anger in the first place. Nevertheless, the department's latest effort should be commended, not least because it makes a nice change from its usual inefficient obsession with low-end benefit fraud. As Willard Foxton wrote in an <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/voices/2012/06/tax-avoidance-isnt-left-or-right-issue-its-cancer-eating-our-democracy)\" title=\"\">excellent article</a> on tax avoidance and evasion:</p> <blockquote> \"Over the last few years HMRC spent \u00a3633,000 on publicity around tackling high-end tax evasion, compared with \u00a317.5m on publicity around tackling benefit fraud. By that crude measure, HMRC considers tackling benefit fraud about 27 times more important than tackling high-end evasion.\" </blockquote> <p>But as heartening as it is to see HMRC getting its priorities straight, I can't help but feel it could have done so much better. A more efficient use of Flickr would have been to upload a photo of Guy Laurence, the UK CEO of Vodafone, a company that <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-1704527/Taxman-let-Vodafone-off-6bn-bill.html\" title=\"\">allegedly avoided \u00a36bn of tax in one transaction alone</a>. If you're going to go for the faces of tax avoidance and evasion, why not tackle the really big hitters?</p> <p>The answer, I suspect, lies in the difference between tax avoidance and evasion. Tax evasion is a morally straightforward affair: it is illegal. Those who do it are breaking the law and must be brought to justice accordingly. <a href=\"http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_taxavoidance.pdf\" title=\"\">Tax avoidance</a>, ie the practice of manipulating legal loopholes in order to circumvent the law without actually breaking it, is rather more complicated. Because it is technically legal, it allows its defenders to make all sorts of spurious excuses for it. We are told it is inevitable, like water escaping through the cracks in a dam. We are even told to discuss it is impolite. As David Cameron <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/21/jimmy-carr-regret-tax-scheme\" title=\"\">said recently</a>, \"I am not going to give a running commentary on different people's tax affairs. I don't think that would be right.\"</p> <p>But most significantly, the legality of tax avoidance means that those who are supposed to prevent it can practice it themselves. As this very paper <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/21/jimmy-carr-regret-tax-scheme\" title=\"\">uncovered in April</a>, David Cameron's own family fortune was made in offshore tax havens. And indeed, the government has benefited from contracts with gargantuan tax avoiders Vodafone, <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2012/04/02/osborne-backs-vodafone-on-india-tax/#axzz23o5BkIHk\" title=\"\">as well as the occasional business trip to India</a>.</p> <p>To that end, it's hard not to see HMRC's pursuit of 20 naughty tax cheats as all rather \"plus \u00e7a change, plus c'est la m\u00eame chose\". The department is willing to act tough when it comes to straightforwardly illegal behaviour by individuals, but refuses to change the structures that allow billions of pounds worth of tax to slip through our fingers legally. Perhaps if HMRC took its duties seriously, Vodafone would be treated as the socially irresponsible entity it is, rather than the legitimate business setting up shop on every local high street. But the law is unlikely to be changed as long as the law-makers benefit from the status quo.</p> <p>We will no doubt continue to be treated to these commendable, but ultimately meaningless endeavours from HMRC, as it tries to respond to popular anger in a way that does nothing to address the issues people are actually angry about. But I feel I should issue the department a warning: UK Uncut's question to tax avoiders \u2013 \"We pay our taxes, why don't you?\" \u2013 is a simple, reasonable one that the public has not forgotten. Tax avoidance is now a widely, deeply felt and persistent issue. Esteemed politico William O'Hagan (aka my dad) once told me that politicians are followers, not leaders. If that's the case, this government better swiftly catch up with the gathering momentum of tax avoidance backlash. I doubt any amount of Flickr sets from HMRC will make that go away.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was commissioned following a suggestion made by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/16/you-tell-us?commentpage=2#comment-17720463\" title=\"\">PaulJB</a>.

  "<p><br><em>Aggregates of the protein fragment (A \u03b2 1-40) associated with Alzheimer's disease, grown in a test-tube. Photograph: Danielle Cannon</em></p> <p>The Higgs boson and the probability that it's been found have been much in the news recently; so has the safe landing on Mars of Nasa's Curiosity. Good times for physicists in making mainstream newspapers, it would seem. But other physicists are quietly beavering away in less visible ways, doing what they've always done best: exploring the world around them with curiosity (that's with a small 'c'), cunning and creativity and at a wide range of different length- and time-scales. Physicists come in many different guises, and what excites one may leave another cold.</p> <p>So let me lay my credentials on the table. I am a soft matter-cum-biological physicist and what excites me is the world around me, the soft squidgy stuff that turns up ubiquitously scattered around our houses in food, cosmetics, paint and ointments, in bulk plastics and novel materials for renewable energy devices; but also, pervasively, in the tissues of our own bodies and the rest of the animal kingdom. Yes, physics and biology can sometimes collide and when they do, it can produce something entirely new.</p> <p>More than half a century ago, physics and biology came together in the work of Crick and Watson \u2013 working at my own place of work, the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge \u2013 with Franklin and Wilkins from Kings College, London. The structure of the DNA double helix was solved by bringing the then relatively new technique of X-ray diffraction to bear on the structure of carefully grown DNA crystals. Out of this and related work grew the whole field of molecular biology and, although physicists often migrated to work in this field, it became divorced from physics as a discipline. </p> <p>For many years after that mainstream physics concentrated on \"simple\" systems which could be fully understood and modelled. Biology tended to be seen as messy and complicated, not a fit subject for a physicist (as a senior departmental colleague once made very clear to me as I made my initial forays into the field), and few individuals in physics departments braved the untidy world of biological organisms. As a result, those whose tastes remained biological would more likely be found in some form of biology department calling themselves biophysicists, or perhaps working as medical physicists in a hospital.</p> <p>But times change and so do the attitudes of physicists towards messy systems. Complexity and emergent phenomena are most definitely now seen as proper domains for a physicist. Emergent phenomena cover processes where the outcome is more than the sum of the component parts, and something new emerges from collective behaviour that could not be predicted by looking at any contributing entity in isolation. This applies to superconductivity in certain complicated inorganic compounds, but also to the synchronised beating of heart cells. Studying biological systems with a physicist's mindset has, if I can put it this way, become respectable, and as a soft matter physicist I no longer feel that colleagues frown upon my research if I mention that I am studying starch, proteins or cellular biophysics.</p> <p>There was, in the past, one way that did seem acceptable for a physicist to enter the biological arena and that was by providing a service, typically imaging of some sort. Medical imaging has made great strides during the past decades \u2013 MRI, CAT scans and ultrasound being familiar to many from hospital visits, often transforming diagnostics and treatment \u2013 and much of their development work can be directly attributed to physicists and engineers. </p> <p>The many new microscopies which are transforming the way we see cells function also owe a lot to physicists' understanding of lenses, noise and image analysis algorithms, coupled with the power of lasers. But historically often this wasn't a true collaboration, more a sort of service agreement, which can end up being frustrating for both sides.</p> <p>My own interest in biological physics stems from my earlier research on synthetic polymers, the long-chain molecules very familiar from the polyethylene of polythene bags or in double glazing made from uPVC (short for unplasticised polyvinyl chloride). Long chain molecules behave in a particular way simply because they are long chains; they can get tangled up in a way small molecules cannot and this means their motion is severely restricted. </p> <p>It also means they can interact at different places along their length to form both specific and non-specific junctions. For instance, in the case of proteins this means tangles and aggregates can form when their native, typically globular, structure is lost and they unravel to reveal their macromolecular (literally 'large molecule' from the Greek) nature. Such protein tangles may arise when denaturation occurs as you cook proteins and then cool them down again to get jelly or yogurt to set; or, more disastrously, they may form in the brains of patients suffering from the various neurodegenerative diseases of old age such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. In these cases it seems the native structure is lost just because the control mechanisms in our brain can break down over the years. </p> <p>The physicist can apply the same basic principles and insights to these two very different situations, and maybe cast new light by looking for universalities rather than the specifics arising from the particular amino acid sequence each different protein possesses. That at least is the hope.</p> <p>There are two drawbacks of working at this interface with biology. Firstly, there is the challenge of finding space to teach it in the undergraduate curriculum. Curricula are always overfull, and no one wants their pet topic to be ousted to make way for something new. The absence of any exposure of many undergraduates to these exciting new topics has been noted, however, and various reports have highlighted that something needs to be done about it (for instance, the <a href=\"http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/SiteCollectionDocuments/Publications/reports/PhysicsInternationalReview.pdf\">2005 EPSRC International Review of Physics</a> remarked upon it, as did the <a href=\"http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/documents/reviews/physics/review.pdf\">2008 RCUK Wakeham Review of Physics</a>).</p> <p>In order to help departments who perhaps lack researchers confident to tackle it, the Institute of Physics is preparing <a href=\"http://biologicalphysics.iop.org/\">new material</a>, which can be slotted in as and when a department feels able to do so. Secondly, because this field is inherently interdisciplinary it can struggle for funding, and may fall down the cracks between research councils. Notably the EPSRC (Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council) may feel the physics isn't original enough, the BBSRC (Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council) may not see cutting edge biology being done, or the MRC (Medical Research Council) may think it is too far removed from disease. </p> <p>Yet the excitement is precisely in bringing the different fields together so that, just as with emergent phenomena, the sum is more than its parts and two apparently \"unoriginal\" components can add up to something truly innovative and exciting. It certainly comes in considerably cheaper than hunting the Higgs.</p> <p>So, with that brief overview of the field I work in, welcome to my own corner of the blogs at Occam's Corner, the outpost on the Guardian blogs of <a href=\"http://occamstypewriter.org/\">Occam's Typewriter</a>. I aim to write not only about my science, but about the world I inhabit as a professor in a research-intensive university and the issues that affect me, my colleagues and the students we teach: expect blogging on the human face of science and the challenges for the workforce, as well as the science itself; and about the things that go right and the things that go, just occasionally, rather disastrously wrong.</p>",
  "<h2>Introduction</h2> <p>Either one of humanity's greatest inventions or a blight on the face of creation (depending on your viewpoint), football's unparalleled popularity guarantees extreme opinions wherever you go. The upside to this stratospheric profile is that opportunities for a beginner to get involved are everywhere. You only really need two things, and both are in the name.</p> <h2>The basics</h2> <p>Two teams attempt to score in the opponent's goal using any part of the body apart from the arms. Eleven-a-side is the true form of the game, but in amateur football five- or seven-a-side is just as common, and all require subtly different skill-sets, with close control and passing valued over, say, heading ability in the smaller-format games. If there are only two of you, try \"three and in\" \u2013 in which players take turns to act as goalkeeper until three goals are scored. If on your own, try playing against a wall, or keepie uppie. The latter may seem impossible at first, but keep going.</p> <p>Diving, meanwhile, can be practised anywhere, at any time. Try crumpling without warning in a queue for the bus. If someone calls an ambulance, join a team.</p> <h2>Health benefits</h2> <p>Football provides an excellent all-round cardiovascular workout, requiring overall stamina and conditioning you for short bursts of movement. It encourages co-ordination, balance, upper and lower body strength, and \u2013 perhaps most crucially of all \u2013 the ability to function well in a team.</p> <h2>Equipment, costs and practicalities</h2> <p>Nothing more expensive is needed to give the game a go than an old ball borrowed from somewhere \u2013 even shoes are not a prerequisite for park football (though check the playing surface for sharp objects/dog poo beforehand). If using footwear, try solid-topped trainers (running shoes don't protect the foot well). For an all-weather surface, a decent pair of \"astros\" (AstroTurf trainers) will cost you anything from \u00a330 up, with studded boots coming in at around the same. Organised football \u2013 or a park game in which studs are involved \u2013 often requires players to wear shinpads, of which a decent pair can be had for a tenner. A good football costs anything from a fiver up.</p> <h2>Trendiness rating: 10/10</h2> <p>It was cool at school, it's cool now. The legions of beer-maddened fans are simply testament to the beautiful game's utter social centrality. Don't fight it \u2013 try it.</p> <h2>Inside line</h2> <p><strong>Kelly Simmons, FA:</strong> \"Football is the nation's game and the number of people taking part, from players and spectators to coaches, match officials and volunteers, continues to grow.

  "<p>Earlier this week we asked for your stories about the most unusual locations in which you've seen musicians perform. Here are some of our favourites. If you've attended any strangely located concerts, let us know in the thread below.</p> <h2>Bringing Woodstock to Warwick</h2> <p>It must have been in the late summer of 1969 when Warwick's own<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/c7b4135b-d12b-429b-b7ff-2584177536f6\"> Edgar Broughton Band</a> responded to the local council's obdurate refusal to let them organise a second Woodstock in <a href=\"http://www.stnicholaspark.co.uk/\">St Nicholas Park</a> \u2013 it seemed a perfectly reasonable idea at the time \u2013 by driving a mobile gig on the back of a Bedford lorry through Warwick on market day. </p> <p>The refreshing strains of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce-v2EyG52Y\">Out Demons Out</a> and a motley audience of hippies, greasers (the nearest Warwick could get to Hells Angels), students and the dispossessed surprised the Saturday crowds and the traders.</p> <p>Revolution was in the air \u2013 it was the nearest Warwick ever came to it \u2013 but, sadly, it was never quite delivered. It was fun though!</p> <p><em>Jim Sweetman</em></p> <h2>Freezing in the belly of a ship</h2> <p>Back in January I saw <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/258787d8-07e4-4ad8-9c5a-89b3908796b0\">Darren Hayman</a> perform his wonderfully melancholic and witty album <a href=\"http://darrenhayman.bandcamp.com/album/the-ships-piano\">The Ship's Piano</a>, on a genuine ship's piano, in the belly of an refurbished lightship docked at Gillingham Pier.</p> <p>The unexpectedly cold evening, and an unheated hold, forced Hayman to play the entire gig without removing his hat, scarf, overcoat and fingerless gloves.</p> <p>The huddled and transfixed audience, who had climbed down a near-vertical ladder to be there, provided an eerie smoke machine effect with our collective breath.</p> <p>The bar was a canteen table wedged between functioning engine control cabinets that tempted the queue with glowing buttons labelled \"start\" and \"abort\". It was almost impossible to hold the cold beer cans in the freezing chill down there.</p> <p>If you went up onto the top deck, you could put your ear to any hole and hear his amazing voice piped from below like it belong to a trapped ghost.</p> <p>It was one of the strangest, most beautiful and unforgettable gigs I've ever been to.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=547504233/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=547504233/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"http://darrenhayman.bandcamp.com/album/the-ships-piano\">The Ship's Piano by Darren Hayman</a></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://darrenhayman.bandcamp.com/album/the-ships-piano\">Reading on mobile? Listen to The Ship's Piano on Bandcamp</a></p> <p><em>John Sutherland</em></p> <h2>Car park noise cannons</h2> <p>The strangest place I've ever seen a gig has to be a car park in East London. This was sometime in the early 90s, when the Disobey club was making a name for itself with a string of interesting one-off events. </p> <p>The only way of finding out the location for this one was to call a recorded information line. That done, I made my way to the car park and waited what seemed like an age for the gig to start. It consisted of someone driving <a href=\"http://kulchermulcher.wordpress.com/2012/05/09/sonic-warfare/\">Jimmy Cauty's armoured vehicle</a> (it may even have been Cauty himself, we were never told) round and round in circles while the Finnish electronic trio <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Sonic\">Panasonic</a> (as they were then called, prior to a lawsuit from the electronics giant) issued wave after wave of pulverizing noise from speakers attached to the vehicle.</p> <p>Indeed, we never found out whether Panasonic themselves were in the armoured vehicle either. It hardly seemed to matter.</p> <p><em>Richard Rees Jones</em></p> <h2>An 'obscure centre of extreme unhappiness'</h2> <p>Leonard Cohen in 1970 and his band doing a warm-up gig for their Isle of Wight festival appearance.</p> <p>Not a small club, as one might have expected, but in the shabby hall of an old-school asylum outside London.</p> <p>I'd been a huge fan of Cohen since the first album and, while on a personal journey to investigate madness, worked as a student nurse in the asylum.</p> <p>The news that he was to play a concert in this obscure centre of extreme unhappiness, where I was working, was frankly unbelievable to me.<br>When I'd recovered from the shock, I did fear that the author of the undeniably bleak vision of those first two albums might not be a perfect fit for the environment he was to play in.</p> <p>I need not have worried.</p> <p>Cohen was not \"me big star, you listen and shut up\" \u2013 he took one look at the unpromising distracted audience, none of whom had a clue of his status and launched into an impromptu hoe-down style of set with himself as the caller.</p> <p>I can't say that he took all of the 200 or so attendees out of their mental prisons but a significant number got into in it in a big way. He brought some joy into a place of intense misery. I was profoundly moved by his willingness to subsume his ego and his courage in choosing to play such a difficult gig.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17696719\">Heliconius</a></em></p>",
  "<h2><strong>1. The Rodgers revolution</strong></h2> <p>Liverpool may need to be patient with Brendan Rodgers. Fully implementing the kind of possession football we saw from his Swansea City side could take a while, maybe even more than a season. Yet the signing of Joe Allen will help in that regard. If Rodgers's methods work, Liverpool will flourish.</p> <h2><strong>2. The arrival of Shinji Kagawa</strong></h2> <p>All the attention at Manchester United will be focused on Robin van Persie, but the Japanese midfielder could prove to be just as influential a signing as the Dutchman. Kagawa scored 17 goals and created 13 for Borussia Dortmund last season. This is one Asian footballer who has not been bought to spike shirt sales.</p> <h2><strong>3. Gylfi Sigurdsson</strong></h2> <p>Losing Luka Modric may not be as much of a blow for Tottenham Hotspur as some fear because in Sigurdsson they have signed a potential star. The Iceland midfielder will not exert as much control as Modric but he is more direct than the Croatian and his shooting ability from long range will delight Tottenham fans.</p> <h2><strong>4. Newcastle's progression</strong></h2> <p>After surprising so many people by challenging for a place in the top four last season, Newcastle United have not been pillaged by bigger clubs and have kept their side together. A young team should get better, although Alan Pardew needs to bolster his squad in order to cope with the demands of the Europa League.</p> <h2><strong>5. No Alex McLeish</strong></h2> <p>When Aston Villa went to Tottenham last season, their wingers were Emile Heskey and Alan Hutton. Heskey and Hutton, McLeish's Ryan Giggs and David Beckham. Paul Lambert should reintroduce old-fashioned values like entertainment and striving to win.</p> <h2><strong>6. The return of Southampton</strong></h2> <p>Life has rarely been simple for Southampton since their relegation from the Premier League under Harry Redknapp seven years ago. They endured administration and a spell in League One but are back now. The Saints might struggle defensively but under Nigel Adkins they will be fun to watch.</p> <h2><strong>7. Watching Sergio Ag\u00fcero</strong></h2> <p>Foreign players are supposed to take time to adapt to English football. Not Ag\u00fcero. From the moment he made his debut against Swansea to the moment he won the title for Manchester City with <em>that</em> goal, the Argentinian got it. And the best thing? He's only going to get better. Enjoy.</p> <h2><strong>8. Can Wigan do it again?</strong></h2> <p>Good old Wigan Athletic. Against all the odds, they're <em>still</em> around. Every year, they seem nailed-on to go down and every year, they stay up. There have been few more stylish escape acts than the one they mustered last season. Can Roberto Mart\u00ednez do it again? Well, he did get Franco Di Santo scoring. Anything's possible.</p> <h2><strong>9. Can Steve Clarke cut it?</strong></h2> <p>Former Chelsea No2s are in vogue \u2013 one of them won the Champions League last season. Unfortunately for West Bromwich Albion, Clarke is not about to emulate Roberto Di Matteo but it will be interesting to see whether the challenge of being the manager will be a step too far.</p> <h2><strong>10. A resurgent Fernando Torres</strong></h2> <p>Given that Spain played most of Euro 2012 without a striker, it was amusing that Torres ended up as the tournament's top scorer. Who knows what effect that could have on his form at Chelsea? His well-taken goal in the 3-2 defeat against Manchester City in the Community Shield suggested that he is regaining his old swagger.</p>",
  "<p>For those of us who have cancelled a social engagement in order to rewatch the entire series of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/may/10/your-next-box-set-comeback\" title=\"\">The Comeback</a>, or whose party trick is to do a move-for-move replay of the Ross-Monica \"routine\" in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/may/06/friends-your-next-box-set\" title=\"\">Friends</a>, there is hope. A new study finds that watching repeats of our favourite TV shows can actually help us feel more in control and happier.</p> <p><a href=\"http://spp.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/08/06/1948550612454889.abstract\" title=\"\">Research from the University of Buffalo</a> builds on the theory that, after periods of self-discipline, a person is more likely to give in to temptation later on. The thinking goes: \"I had a salad for lunch, therefore I'm going to have a pizza lightly sprinkled with a large bag of chips for dinner.\" In order to avoid this and to replenish our sense of self-control we need to boost our happiness levels, which is where rewatching much-loved TV shows comes in. Psychologist Dr Jaye Derrick calls this effect \"social surrogacy\", likening our old TV pals to a virtual friends and family. In experiments involving essay writing and word association, people found it easier to maintain their self-control and concentration if they had also been asked to describe a favourite television show. Others kept diaries to find out how entering \"familiar fictional worlds\" improved their mood. \"[TV] can have unexpected psychological benefits,\" writes Derrick, \"[and] fulfil needs that people are reluctant to fulfil through other means.\"</p> <p>Which is fine, unless you happen to be reacquainting yourself with the devastating final episodes of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/apr/01/next-box-set-six-feet-under\" title=\"\">Six Feet Under</a>, M*A*S*H or The Wonder Years. In that case, you may want to add \"large tub of ice cream\" and \"family size box of tissues\" to your pizza'n'chips shopping list.</p>",
  "<p>The mental health advocate of the Moors murderer Ian Brady has been arrested on suspicion of preventing the burial of Keith Bennett, one of Brady and Myra Hindley's five young victims.</p> <p>Bennett was 12 and on his way to visit his grandmother when he was taken and murdered by the pair on 16 June 1964.</p> <p>Like the other youngsters snatched by Brady and Hindley \u2013 Pauline Reade, John Kilbride, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans \u2013 he was killed and buried on Saddleworth moor above Manchester.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394827871\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2009/7/1/1246439951099/Keith-Bennett-who-was-kil-004.jpg\" alt=\"Keith Bennett, who was killed by Myra Hindley and Ian Brady\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keith Bennett</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Neither Brady nor Hindley, who died aged 60 in 2002, has revealed where Bennett's body was buried, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/jan/07/winnie-johnson-keith-bennett-moors-murders?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">despite repeated pleas from his mother, Winnie Johnson</a>.</p> <p>Police confirmed on Friday that Jackie Powell, who was appointed as Brady's advocate under the Mental Health Act in 1999, had been arrested in south Wales on suspicion of preventing the lawful and decent burial of a body without lawful excuse.</p> <p>Powell was apparently detained after telling a Channel 4 documentary that Brady gave her a sealed envelope to pass on to Johnson in the event of Brady's death.</p> <p>In a statement, Greater Manchester police said they had recently received information that led them to believe Brady had finally disclosed details of the location of the body to one of his \"long-term visitors\" at Ashworth high-security hospital where he is being detained.</p> <p>The force did not name the suspect but said a 49-year-old woman had been arrested in south Wales and remained in custody for questioning.</p> <p>A police spokesman added: \"Officers in the cold case unit made inquiries to verify the accuracy of this report and have since had extensive contact with Ashworth hospital and Keith's close family. As a result, warrants obtained under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act were executed at Ashworth hospital and a private address in south Wales.</p> <p>\"A 49-year-old woman has been arrested in south Wales on suspicion of preventing the burial of a body without lawful exercise and remains in police custody for questioning. Searches of both locations are ongoing.\"</p> <p>Martin Bottomley, head of investigative review of Greater Manchester police's major and cold case crime unit, said: \"The Moors murders cast a long and dark shadow over the history of our region but in 2009 we reluctantly concluded there was no longer any specific information to identify new search areas and the investigation to find Keith entered a dormant stage. However, we have always stressed this is a case we will never close.</p> <p>\"We have been, and always will be, open to pursuing any new lines of inquiry that arise from significant scientific advances or credible and actionable information.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I want to be explicitly clear about this: Ian Brady has not revealed to police the location of Keith's body. What we are looking at is the possibility \u2013 and at this stage it is only a possibility \u2013 that he has written a letter to Keith's mum, Winnie Johnson, which was not to be opened until after his death. We do not know if this is true or simply a ruse but we clearly have a duty to investigate such information on behalf of Keith's family.</p> <p>\"Since Keith was so cruelly taken away all those years ago, our thoughts have always been with his family as they try to come to terms with what happened. All they want is to finally be able to lay Keith to rest. What I would ask is that the media respect their privacy at this time. Winnie herself is very ill and continued speculation about this letter will only cause the family more upset.\"</p> <p>The force later said the woman had been bailed for three months.</p> <p>The Guardian understands that officers seized documents from Powell's house, but believe there is no clear evidence that Brady has revealed the location of Keith's grave.</p> <p>It is thought that Johnson is not yet aware of the recent developments. Her lawyer, John Ainley, told the Press Association: \"Winnie has always believed that Ian Brady knew where her son was buried. She never thought anything else. He had a dialogue with Winnie some years ago and she was certain that he could have provided information that would have given her closure in this harrowing case.\"</p> <p>Last December, Johnson said she wanted to hear face-to-face from Brady where her son was buried. She renewed her plea last month, saying in a letter to the 74-year-old killer that her dying wish was to know where Keith's body was.</p> <p>The makers of the documentary said they had not seen the envelope.</p> <p>The documentaries commissioning editor and editor for Cutting Edge, Emma Cooper, said: \"No one can verify the contents of the envelope and therefore what information it does or does not contain but given the enormity of the implications as suggested by Brady's letter, we felt we had a responsibility to inform the family via their family liaison officer.</p> <p>\"Winnie's poor health was foremost in our decision-making and this is why we have decided to bring forward the broadcast of the film and make the existence of the envelope public.\"</p> <p>The film, Ian Brady: Endgames of a Psychopath, will be broadcast on Monday at 9pm. In an interview she gave for the programme, Powell said she had received a letter of instruction and a sealed envelope from Brady via his solicitors. She explained that the letter of instruction stated the additional envelope contained three letters \u2013 one apparently addressed to Johnson.</p> <p>Powell, who has professional obligations in her capacity as executor and her role as Brady's mental health advocate, told the documentary she had not opened the sealed envelope so could not be certain of its contents. But she told the Daily Mirror Brady did not want \"to take his secrets to the grave\", adding that the document could afford Johnson \"the means of her possibly being able to rest\".</p> <p>Brady was jailed for life at Chester Assizes in 1966 for the murders of John, Lesley Ann and Edward. Hindley was convicted of killing Lesley Ann and Edward and shielding Brady after John's murder, and jailed for life. In 1987 the pair finally admitted killing Keith and Pauline.</p> <p>Both were taken to Saddleworth moor in 1987 to help police find the remains of the missing victims but only Pauline's body was found.</p> <p>Brady was due to go before a mental health tribunal in July, but it was delayed after he suffered a seizure. The tribunal was to consider his application to be transferred to a Scottish prison and be allowed to die. He has been tube-fed since refusing food 12 years ago.</p> <p>David Wilson, a professor of criminology at Birmingham City University and an expert on serial killers, expressed doubt about the existence of the letter.</p> <p>\"There is no new information here,\" he said. \"Ian Brady went back to the moors in 1987 and said to the police officer: 'Who moves that mountain?' They stopped the investigation then because it's quite clear he didn't have a clue where the body was. This is not about Keith Bennett, or Winnie Johnson, it's about Ian Brady.</p> <p>\"He is a master of trying to inject what is broadcast and printed about him, and making sure we interpret the story in the way he would like us to interpret it. He's unique in the sense that most serial killers don't want to talk and communicate. Ian Brady communicates all the time. When you assess what he writes it is usually self-serving nonsense, not remotely reliable.\"</p> <p>Wilson said he was on the moors four weeks ago and saw the tributes Johnson had left for son.</p> <p>\"I want there to be a positive ending, but I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him. He's legally insane, so why do we believe he's going to say anything at all that can be reliable?\"</p> <p>Documentary-maker Paddy Wivell told Radio 4's Today programme: \"I think we probably have to approach it with some sense of caution too. This seems to me like very much part of Brady's pathology, one of power and control.</p> <p>\"He is a sadistic psychopath and it would appear that this is some sort of victory dance, a kind of power game, in the fact that he constantly puts conditions on things. The condition that it can only be opened in the event of his death is consistent with this kind of behaviour over the years.\"</p> <p>Lord Pendry, who was the MP for Stalybridge and Hyde for 31 years, told the Guardian he was responsible for persuading Brady to visit the moors in 1987 and to \"match his words with deeds\".</p> <p>\"I got Brady up to the moors as my constituency was in Hattersley and he was a constituent. It's just now that people are talking as if he's never been up there,\" Pendry said.</p> <p>He wrote to Brady in September 1987 and then visited him in hospital. \"I spent five hours with him \u2013 longer than anybody else,\" he said. \"I convinced him to go up and look for the boy Bennett's body. Then I went to Manchester police and they took him up there. He couldn't find it.</p> <p>\"It was an almost impossible situation. Myra Hindley took them to Lesley Ann Downey's grave. He was anxious to upstage her.\"</p> <p>Pendry said: \"I don't know what's new about the situation. He has been up there previously and couldn't find it then.\"</p> <p>He questioned whether Brady was \"leading more people up the garden path\".</p>",
  "<p>In the neighbourhood over the fence from Italy's \u2013 and Europe's \u2013 biggest steelworks, Francesco Mastrocinque is poking his toe into the layer of black and red powder that covers every pavement and counting his friends who have died of cancer and respiratory illnesses.</p> <p>\"It's about one a month, but people round here try not to think about it,\" said the shopkeeper, as he looked up at the chimney towering over Taranto's Tamburi quarter \u2013 a dark, dusty corner of Puglia where residents are now forbidden by law from touching the soil.</p> <p>The Ilva steelworks, owned by Italy's Riva family, employs 12,000 and breathes life into the depressed local economy, but has long been accused of killing off local people by belching into the air a mix of minerals, metals and carcinogenic dioxins \u2013 8.8% of the total dioxins emitted in Europe, according to a 2005 study. More recent government figures put the cancer death rate in the area at 15% above the national average and lung cancer deaths at 30% higher. Prosecutors say emissions have killed 400 people in 13 years.</p> <p>So few were surprised when a magistrate this month ordered the shutdown of the most polluting furnaces, described Ilva as \"an environmental disaster\" and placed members of the Riva family under house arrest, claiming they were \"perfectly aware\" of what they were dumping on Taranto. A former employee was also put under investigation for allegedly paying off a government inspector to tone down a report.</p> <p>But what happened next was less expected. Unions went on strike to protest against the magistrate's decision, blocking roads with banners. \"Dioxin levels have been reduced and emissions can be cut further with new technology, without stopping production,\" said Rocco Palombella, secretary general of the UILM union. He has worked alongside the 1,300C furnaces at Ilva for 36 years without, he says, falling ill.</p> <p>The government then backed the unions, with the environment minister, Corrado Clini, saying it would take eight months for the furnaces to cool down, during which time Chinese competition would reap rewards. Bizarrely, Italy's health minister warned that losing your job was detrimental to your health.</p> <p>Clini, who met local leaders in Taranto on Friday, promised cash to clean up Ilva. He also said health studies do not reflect emission cuts already made. \"Clini is lying about this since the magistrate's report is based on studies concluded this year,\" said Angelo Bonelli, leader of the Green party in Italy. \"We know that mothers in Taranto today have three times the allowed level of dioxins in their milk.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394880419\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/8/17/1345221963775/Taranto-Italy-locator-001.png\" alt=\"Taranto, Italy locator\" width=\"220\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taranto, Italy locator Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a region known for baroque towns like Lecce and traditional Trullo cottages tucked into olive groves, Taranto is the exception. Its skyline is dominated by smoking chimneys and its old town is a half abandoned collection of bricked up and crumbling palazzi.</p> <p>Farmers were put out of business when grazing was banned within 20km (12.4 miles) of Ilva and almost 3,000 livestock with excessive dioxin levels were slaughtered. Mussel cultivation, for which Taranto is renowned, is struggling after beds were moved away from the steelworks.</p> <p>\"There isn't a family in Tamburi without a sick or dead member thanks to Ilva,\" said Rosella Balestra, a local activist. \"People ignored it for a long time but now, when I talk to them, tears often come. Slowly, a wall of self denial is coming down.\"</p> <p>Despite initial suspicion among mothers, Balestra began warning children playing in the piazzas not to touch flower beds after she discovered the council had done little to publicise its ban on contact with the polluted soil.</p> <p>Pollution is part of local life. Every day residents sweep their balconies clean of the red mineral dust blowing in from Ilva's mountainous deposits and the black soot from its chimneys, which regularly clog storm drains.</p> <p>\"The magistrates launched their inquiry here when politicians failed to do their duty, and now the politicians are attacking the magistrates for doing theirs,\" said Balestra.</p> <p>According to Patrizio Mazza, a doctor, the dust is killing young and old. \"I first noticed the increase when I treated a 10-year-old boy five years ago with throat cancer,\" he said. \"It is no good reducing emissions now because any new emissions at all simply top up the saturated earth and water. The furnaces must be shut down.\"</p> <p>A growing protest movement, which mounted a 2,000-strong march in Taranto on Friday, has found a champion in Cataldo Ranieri, a 42-year-old Ilva employee who initially backed management against the magistrates, blocking a road in protest in July. \"A man came up to me that day and said, 'My wife needs to get through to do her chemotherapy.' That changed my life.\"</p> <p>Mazza said rates of tumours among Ilva staff who were campaigning to keep the plant open was 10 times higher than the national average. \"Workers there just wanted to think about their work, not illness,\" said Vincenzo Pignatelli, 60, who worked near the furnaces for 29 years and survived leukaemia after retiring in 2002. \"Four colleagues in my group of about 100 died of leukaemia and I would see so many former colleagues during my trips to hospital it was like a works reunion.\"</p> <p>Bonelli shrugged off the government's view that the local \u2013 and national \u2013 economy would suffer if Ilva closed its most polluting furnaces, saying: \"Bilbao and Pittsburgh managed it thanks to investment, why not Taranto?\"</p> <p>In Tamburi, Francesco Mastrocinque watched as children kicked a football around on a dusty patch of earth, flouting the ban.</p> <p>\"The red mineral powder glitters in the gutters, but the black soot feels like fine sand when it gets into your mouth,\" he said. \"Ilva have paid for improvements in the neighbourhood, like putting fountains in the cemetery, but they didn't clean the tombstones, which are slowly turning black and red.\"</p>",

The loss to Sporting KC cost Seattle their second shot at a major trophy (Santos Laguna eliminated Seattle from the CONCACAF Champions League) and the loss to San Jose likely cost the Sounders a chance at the Supporters' Shield. Both matches were close. There is no reason for despair, but still any chance at a trophy lost is a large negative moment.</p> <p>Coming into the Sounders game against the Whitecaps the team needs to declare dominance. They will be challenged by one of the better defensive teams in the league, but they will have the support of more than 55,000 people. New addition Christian Tiffert will offer more ball control, while a healthy Michael Gspurning commands his backline with his international experience. Young Olympian Mario Martinez is only expected to be available as a sub at most, but Seattle's offense doesn't need help at this time. Both Montero and Johnson are on form at this point and should score a goal or goals. It's time for the Sounders to declare themselves. There is no space left for another poor run. Crunch time and Cascadia in front of crowd that will fit two MLS crowds, that's what everyone wants.</p> <p><strong>Benjamin Massey</strong>, Editor, <a href=\"http://www.eightysixforever.com\">Eighty Six Forever</a>, Vancouver:</p> <p>The good news for the Vancouver Whitecaps is that lately they've been looking great against good teams. Recent victories over Salt Lake and San Jose and credible draws are enough to wash out the stink of Wednesday's game, when the half-strength Whitecaps lost to a half-strength FC Dallas 2-0 in the ugliest match since they gave up the WM formation. What can you draw from a loss when half of Vancouver's starting lineup was injured, suspended, or on international duty? Not much.</p> <p>Not that it gets that much better against Seattle on Saturday. Jay DeMerit is concussed, Martin Bonjour is suspended, and given the way David Ferreira effortlessly handled Vancouver's central defense on Wednesday it's easy to picture Fredy Montero pulling the same tricks. Seattle is excellent, even compared to the best Whitecaps starters, and tough to play at the Clink. Yet, if we treat Wednesday as a one-off aberration, Vancouver's form suggests it should be a heck of a game.</p> <h2>Toronto FC vs Sporting KC, 4:30pm Sat</h2> <p><strong>Sonja Missio</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.90minutesofhopp.com\">90 Minutes of Hopp</a>, Toronto:</p> <p>Toronto FC's Wednesday night hosting of Portland was fairly indicative of its entire season: in front of an excited crowd full of optimism, the match (1) dragged into a slow start, (2) had an early away lead, (3) exploded after the half with hope, a drawing goal, and a chance for the win, and (4) ended with an away equalizer in the 83rd minute. Scripted perfectly like a predictable soap opera, you have to give them this: TFC will never let you down, as long as if you know what to look for. </p> <p>Despite missing quite a bit of the squad due to international call-ups (including newly signed Irishman Darren O'Dea), there were a few notable points fans could take home happy: recent signee Eric Hassli scored his first home goal for Toronto and Milo\u0161 Koci\u0107 was on top form for a couple of great saves. Yes, TFC gave up its three points due to the same problem they always had (namely, their Achilles' heel of a backline), especially in regard to Portland's first goal. And yes, TFC is now back to being in the league's last place. Still, the Hassli goal stands to remind fans good things are still to come. Eventually. Maybe even in this season. </p> <p>That said, from playing the last-placed team in the Western Conference to playing the first-placed in the Eastern on Saturday, Toronto looks ahead to reclaiming those three points at home against Sporting Kansas. With their new signing and the inevitable post game pep talk the team received from Paul Mariner, Saturday may become an example of those \"good things still to come.\" Just, hopefully, Mariner gets his voice back by then.</p> <p><strong>Mike Kuhn</strong>, Editor, <a href=\"http://www.downthebyline.com/\">Down the Byline</a>, Sporting Kansas City:</p> <p>There was no Open Cup hangover for Sporting KC last weekend against DC. After 120 minutes and penalty kicks against Seattle, KC came out and got a big league win against DC that was desperately needed after KC's poor run of form lately at home outside of the Open Cup (0 wins in 4 in league play before the game against DC). And it wasn't as close as the 2-1 score line showed as KC hit the bar a couple times and controlled the game. </p> <p>For the first time in 8 weeks, KC actually didn't have a midweek game ahead of their trip to BMO Field on Saturday. With league, Open Cup, and friendlies, KC played 17 games in 56 days since they last played Toronto on June 16th. Sporting finally get a few extra days of rest and training ahead of the trip, although 3 potential starters are away with their national team. The extra rest for Sporting will be a nice break for the team after the busy schedule and maybe give players a few extra days to heal some of those minor knocks. KC hasn't won at BMO since the very first game there in 2007, since then, KC has 2 loses and 3 draws and haven't scored a single goal. KC has a good chance of ending both of those streaks this coming weekend against a struggling TFC side.</p> <h2>Montreal Impact vs San Jose Earthquakes, 7:30pm Sat</h2> <p><strong>Sofiane Benzaza</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.mountroyalsoccer.com\">Mount Royal Soccer</a>, Montreal:</p> <p>3 wins in a row!!! 3 wins in a row !!!</p> <p>The Montreal Impact continued its winning streak as it defeated another patriotic-themed team. After the Philadelphia Union, the New England Revolution fell to the Impact 1-0. With its 2nd road win this season, Montreal is making a run for the playoffs even if the team has 2-5 more games played than its competition. You know what? Let those teams play and win those games in hand if they wish: the only thing is that these teams will face each other. Another Montreal Impact goal is up for MLS Goal of The Week with Sanna Nyassi's Maradonesque run and cannon shot to give the win.</p> <p>Back at home, Montreal will host the Creme de la Creme in the San Jose Earthquakes and Chris Wondolowski at Stade Saputo on the weekend. It's another must-win situation for the Impact as they face the best team in the league, who have a potent attack, clutch player and very active outside backs. Troy Perkins experience against the Western beast (from his time with the Timbers) will help a lot as the newly acquired goalkeeper registered a shut-out for his new team. Stade Saputo is a fortress and usually no adversaries are spared from taking the heat from the Impact: will Montreal be efficient in front of the net?</p> <p><strong>Lisa Erickson</strong>, <a href=\"\" http: www.centerlinesoccer.com \"\">Center Line Soccer</a>, San Jose:</p> <p>Seattle had a rough week and the Quakes decided to twist the knife a little bit more by winning the game in the 3rd minute of stoppage time. The match was a defensive battle much of the game, with Fredy Montero slotted home an equalizer in the 92nd. But the Quakes didn't worry - they looked at each other, sped down the pitch and got the winner. Shea Salinas floated the ball into the box with 10 seconds left in the match and found the curly blonde head of Steven Lenhart, who headed the ball past Gspurning and into the back of the net.</p> <p>Now allons-y \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al... &#xa0;this will be the first and only time this year that the first place Quakes (14 - 5 - 5) will face the Impact (10 - 13 - 3), who are currently sixth in the East. L'Impact are coming off of a 3 game winning streak and have not lost at home since July 4th. Montr\u00e9al has upgraded their goalkeeper, grabbed a few more Italian stars, and moved into their natural grassy home at Saputo. Their midfield pair of Bernier and Felipe have scored 10 goals and 14 assists between them and will keep the San Jose defense on their toes. The Quakes will have five players coming off of international duty (Wondolowski, Beitashour, Gordon, Bernardez, and Chavez) and will be missing Gordon and Salinas due to red card suspension and hamstring injury respectively. It will be a tough game but I still feel that the Quakes will pull out the win with a score of 3 - 1.</p> <h2>Chicago Fire vs New England Revolution, 8:30pm Sat</h2> <p><strong>Dan Martin</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.section8chicago.com/\">Section 8</a>, Chicago:</p> <p>The 4-goal performance from the Fire in the Union's house was great to see (yes, I'm counting the own goal). Points against teams lower down the standings are crucial right now, so when Philly lined up a less-than-first-choice defense everyone knew the new-look Fire offense could take advantage. Chris Rolfe fans were singing of his romantic prowess as he looked like his old self, scoring almost at will while also setting up chances for his team-mates, and Arne Friedrich's game-winning goal nicely accents his strong defensive form of late. Forward Sherjill MacDonald put himself in good spaces to score and assisted on Rolfe's first goal, but will need to hone his finishing touch. Meanwhile, Captain Logan Pause was injured in a collison but played for almost 20 more minutes with two broken ribs and a collapsed lung before being subbed off. Overall, it was a fantastic result for a Fire side that is starting to show a bit of swagger at both ends of the field and the depth to back it up.</p> <p>It's always a must-see game when New England comes to town. Matches against the Fire's playoff rivals of seasons past never fail to bring a chippy, combative style of play. Pause's absence in the midfield means that Frank Klopas will have adjustments to make, whether he brings in Daniel Paladini or Mike Vidiera to take the captain's spot or takes a chance by starting a lone defensive mid. There have also been rumblings that Fire homegrown player Victor Pineda could see the gameday lineup. I expect the Fire to come out attacking and play for the win, continuing their streak against Eastern Conference clubs and solidifying their spot in the playoff standings.</p> <p><strong>Christopher Camille</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.midnightriders.com/\">Midnight Riders</a>, author of NE tactics blog <a href=\"http://soccertheory.wordpress.com/\">Soccer Theory</a>:</p> <p>Last week the Revs turned in another dire performance in a match that they absolutely needed. After a fast start, Heaps is looking every bit the rookie coach this season. Tactically, the team has taken a midfield shape that is far too narrow when one considers the attacking limitations of their full backs. </p> <p>Heaps really needs to keep it simple as the team goes forward this season. His knack for tinkering has undone the squad on too many occasions. They need to go back to basics and hopefully a basic 4-4-2 is employed against Chicago this Saturday. It would be nice to see how Saer Sene gets on with Jerry Bengston up front. There likely isn't much to be salvaged from the 2012 season for the Revs, but a result in Chicago against a rival would be a great start.</p> <h2>Real Salt Lake vs FC Dallas, 9pm Sat</h2> <p><strong>Matt Montgomery</strong>, <a href=\"http://underthecrossbar.com/\">Under the Crossbar</a>, Real Salt Lake:</p> <p>A dour streak of matches, culminating in a 2-1 road loss to Vancouver, has plagued Real Salt Lake in recent weeks. An unlucky bounce and a brilliant strike condemned the club to fourth straight road loss, but top-to-down, things have just seemed a bit off. Injuries, of course, have taken a toll as well \u2014 particularly as Jamison Olave has been ruled out of contention for some weeks and Javier Morales's body continues to fight against his continued return. Factor in 90 minutes of international duty for Kyle Beckerman (USA), Alvaro Saborio (Costa Rica), and Will Johnson (Canada), and changes are likely on Saturday.</p> <p>It is in this context which this Saturday's home duel against FC Dallas will be looking to turn things around. Rotation, especially with a must-win CONCACAF Champions League match on Tuesday coming quickly, seems rather inevitable. Though fatigue and injuries will play into coach Jason Kreis's squad selection, a recognition that the Supporters Shield is still an attainable if distant goal should mean a strong selection. Youngsters and newcomers like Sebastian Velasquez, Justin Braun, and Kenny Mansally will be hunting for minutes, while some \u2014 Kwame Watson-Siriboe and Luis Gil, particularly \u2014 are practically assured starting spots on Saturday. Should a valuable win materialize on the weekend, Real Salt Lake could be in pole position to challenge San Jose as the season reaches its apex.</p> <p><strong>Parrish Glover</strong>, <a href=\"http://the-inferno.net\">The Inferno</a>, Dallas:</p> <p>Brek Shea is back. His darting run at the defense to set up the winning goal in Azteca shows that the 2011 form and daring are still there. Getting a call-up despite poor recent form and finding productive time almost felt like a subtle jab from Jurgen Klinsmann to Schellas Hyndman saying, \"Play him on the left. Let him run.\"<br> Meanwhile, FC Dallas now finds itself 8 points out of the final playoff spot with 8 games left to play. It's a hard uphill road, but we will be playing meaningful games for a few more weeks. We'll need to continue to put together the types of results that have put us in this position, though. This past weekend saw the team's second come-from-behind victory over Colorado in a month. Wednesday night featured a physical 2-0 win over Vancouver, with goals coming from Fabian Castillo and Jonathan Top. Fans are definitely loving the play from the youngsters, as Castillo (20) and Top (19) combined are about the same age as Kevin Hartman (38). This weekend brings yet another match against a conference foe ahead of us in the playoff race, and therefore another opportunity to claw our way up the ladder. Trips to Salt Lake have often ended poorly for FCD in recent years, but then again the United States had never won in Mexico until Brek Shea showed up.</p> <h2>Colorado Rapids vs Chivas USA, 9pm Sat</h2> <p><strong>Todd Haggerty</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.pidarmy.com\">Pid Army</a>:</p> <p>Last match was typical: the Rapids lost. At least when the Rapids play there is very little chance of a draw, they have only one on the season. Up next, Chivas USA. The hype machine is at full tilt whenever these teams play each other and this has all of the ingredients of a classic... At this point in the season and with the team in complete disarray one can only joke. The squad that will take the field Saturday is increasingly becoming more unrecognizable to the one that rode lady luck and won the title two years ago. Conor Casey is perpetually injured or disinterested, Omar Cummings is apparently the butt of jokes to OP and Tim Hinchey and a whole cast of extras show up to play fullback every week. Looming over all of these challenges is the loss of Pablo Mastroeni; it is hard to imagine the Rapids having their current run of form with him in the squad. Back to the clash of MLS giants, I expect the Rapids to earn their second draw of the season in front of a packed house in Commerce City. </p> <p><strong>Julio Ramos</strong>, \"Chivas Mayor\", <a href=\"http://unionultras.com/\">Union Ultras</a>, Chivas: </p> <p>Last week against the Galaxy was a game that most of the fans will want to forget. To lose was one thing, but they just showed such all round weakness - they allowed the Galaxy to make fun of our supporters and did nothing. It just showed weakness all through the team , and if it wasn't for Dan kennedy it could have been 7-0 not 4-0. No Passion, no guts, no heart.</p> <p>We want the team to be more aggressive. Fight for the ball, show they want it and that they want to be a winning team. To me though, the lack of consistency in the line up and formation is a real problem. The coach is cautious and changes his side round to try and match up to the opposition and their players and system - that's a mistake. We need our own style. Against Colorado we need a win. All the games are crucial now. We have 4 games in hand and we're 11 points out - there's no more room for mistakes and we need to go on a run in those games. </p> <h2>D.C. United vs Philadelphia, 5pm Sun (NBCSN, TSN 2, RDS2)</h2> <p><strong>Kim Kolb</strong>, <a href=\"http://screaming-eagles.com/\">Screaming Eagles</a>:</p> <p>United traveled to Kansas City for an important conference match up, but they did so short handed. Not making the trip due to injury were Dwayne DeRosario, Robbie Russell, Maicon Santos, and Daniel Woolard; four players who were in the starting XI when things were going well for United. Though United did get some backline reinforcement in a midweek trade bringing Mike Chabala. Kansas City is a potent foe as it is, and taking them on missing so much character and talent proved to be too much. United tried to absorb pressure and stay with KC, but fell 2-1.</p> <p>This week, Philadelphia makes the trek down to RFK. The teams swapped players on Thursday, with United sending fan favorite Danny Cruz in exchange for Lionard Pajoy. Cruz won a lot of fans with his work ethic and commitment on and off the field, but with tremendous depth in the wide midfield positions (Pontius, Najar, DeLeon, and Lewis) it was difficult to get playing time, and trading him to somewhere where he will play is a fair thing to do. It looks as though DeRosario will return to the lineup, can Pajoy gell with new teammates in 72 hours? United needs the points, and needs to build momentum heading into the Fall.</p> <p><strong>Corey Furlan</strong>, <a href=\"http://beta.sonsofben.com/\">Sons of Ben</a>, Philadelphia Union:</p> <p>Last week was worst performance of the year to be honest. Looked like we were really disheveled and disorganized. Best I can say is that it might be a tribute to how good Valdes is usually, bot as Hackworth said afterwards, it was unacceptable. Soumare showed a little promise but he's not where he needs to be physically coming off an injury. He's going to be a great addition for the team, but this time he played out of necessity and it showed.</p> <p>The game this weekend at DC? This is it, this is the season. If we don't win this weekend we can forget the season. The Union dug themselves a pretty big hole this year. Can we best DC? It depends on what team shows up - the team that beat Sporting KC 4-1 or the team that lost to the Fire 3-1. I'm interested to see Cruz play after the trade for Pajoy. I think DC got the better end of the deal maybe, but you can't finish 2 out of 10 chances and expect to keep leading the forward line.</p> <h2>New York Red Bulls vs Portland Timbers, 7pm Sun(Galavision)</h2> <p><strong>Dan Dickinson</strong>, <a href=\"http://gothamist.com\">Gothamist</a>, New York:</p> <p>What a difference a week can make. The Red Bulls looked hungry in their third and final match against Houston for 2012, and took away a well earned 3 points. Was it Dax McCarty returning from his suspension? Was it Tim Cahill starting to get into form? Was it perhaps just that Mac Kandji couldn't get one into the net? Any way you slice it, it's always difficult to figure out what the right equation is for what makes NY dominate one match and not show up another.</p> <p>Up next, the Timbers. Last year, both teams were battling to the very end for the final playoff spots. This year, no such drama: RBNY has almost double the points and goals scored. The difference in form could not be more stark: the Red Bulls remain undefeated at home and lead the East in scoring, while the Timbers have not won on the road yet in 2012 (although they did break their four month long road scoreless streak against Toronto on Wednesday). Some may want to scream \"trap game\", but that would require Portland having shown signs of a pulse sometime this year. This should be an easy and convincing win for the Red Bulls.</p> <p><strong>Roger Anthony</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.timbersarmy.org\">Timbers Army</a>, Portland:</p> <p>The Timbers stretched their unbeaten streak to two games \u2013 and their winless streak to seven \u2013 with a ragged-but-entertaining draw in Toronto. Once again, Interim Coach Gavin Wilkinson went with a lineup that had striker Kris Boyd soloing on top. Variously labeled as a 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3, it's been most successful when it morphs into a 4-1-4-1.</p> <p>That process may have been abetted by the absence of wings Kalif Alhassan (leg) and Franck Songo'o (yellow cards). Without them looking to beat people off the dribble, the ball moved quickly and unpredictably during the first half, giving Portland a rare possession advantage. The game-tying goal in the 82nd minute was produce by three quick touches that culminated with MF Eric Alexander sending LB Steven Smith in alone on Toronto keeper Milos Kocic. When Kocic came out, Smith chipped a perfectly weighted mini-cross to MF Darlington Nagbe, whose header gave the club a very stylish draw and their first road point since April.</p> <p>So now, off to New York and a few interesting questions: Will NY forward Kenny Cooper feast on his former team? Can Boyd rise to the challenge that Cooper presents? Can CB David Horst continue to wreak havoc on corner kicks? For this week at least, the Timbers will count themselves as one of the big winners in the Sebastian LeToux/Dane Richards deal between Vancouver and the Soda Pops. Richards ran wild against Portland last year, and after seeing Ashton Morgan completely befuddle RB Kosuke Kimura in the second half of the Toronto match, Portland is thrilled not to face Richards for another week.</p> <h2>Houston Dynamo vs Columbus Crew, 9pm Sun</h2> <p><strong>Zach Woosley</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.dynamotheory.com/\">Dynamo Theory</a>, Houston:</p> <p>Last game? What game? I know not of this \"game\" you speak of. Since I doubt that will work, I suppose I have to address the Dynamo's 2-0 defeat in New York. It pretty much stunk, but the scoreline was a bit unfair since the second goal was ridiculously offside. Either way, the Dynamo didn't play well and were beaten by an inspired Red Bulls side that needed to bounce back. It's not the end of the world and you can't win every game, especially in MLS, but considering Houston had there chances and couldn't finish them, it's disappointing.</p> <p>Back home to to friendly and oh so orange confines of BBVA Compass Stadium. This time, the Columbus Crew visit, fresh off a midweek game against the LA Galaxy. No offense to the Crew but if the Dynamo don't win this one, I might be tempted to hit the panic button. Even in a parity-ridden league like MLS where the best team can lose to the worst at any moment, this is a game the Dynamo need to win to get some momentum back. I expect to see the Dynamo win and do it in style with a clean sheet, anything less would be uncivilized...or unacceptable...or both.</p> <p><strong>Ian Fraser</strong>, <a href=\"http://crewunion.com\">Crew Union</a>, Columbus Crew:</p> <p>Thanks to Toronto FC and MLS HQ, the Crew were able to spend last Saturday saying goodbye to a teammate and friend instead of playing a trivial game. It didn't take long to get that first game out of the way as the Galaxy rolled into Columbus on Wednesday night. In an evening&#xa0;spent honoring the life of Kirk Urso, the team could've come out with a determined focus or a heavy hearted performance. As it was, Columbus survived a couple Robbie Keane forays early and started to take command but all the chances they created were just off the mark and instead of going into the break with a cozy lead, they were tied at 0. For all the good chances they failed to convert in the 1st half, Jairo Arrieta scored an unlikely goal right away in the second, but Columbus' attacking prowess waned and Robbie Keane was able to sneak in an equalizer to allow the Galaxy to steal a draw. Not the win the team desperately wanted, but they put in a great performance under the circumstances. This game was about something more than a result. RIP Kirk Urso - Forever Massive.<br>&#xa0;<br>This Sunday,&#xa0;Columbus travel to the most recent 'new stadium fortress' in MLS - Houston.&#xa0;This trip is always difficult with the extreme heat and humidity and the Dynamo have been even harder to beat in their new home. Columbus' lineup is really starting to come together and they have been playing well recently, but I wouldn't be shocked if all the events of the last 2 weeks catch up to them in this game. The emotional first game has passed and now they have to turn right around and get ready&#xa0;for this trip. I hate to say it, but I think Columbus will look like a team that has gone through an ordeal in this one&#xa0;and come home with a loss.</p>",

  "<p>In the early 2000s, something disheartening happened to action adventure game design. The emphasis on high-end visuals and cinematic storytelling led to the dominance of linear progression and spoon-fed plot. Artificial intelligence became about having baddies who could avoid gunfire rather than engage with the lead character in meaningful ways. In a sense, the mechanisms of the virtual world were being quietly but forcefully withdrawn from the player.</p> <p>Remember Deus Ex \u2013 Warren Spector's intimidating, panoramic cyberpunk epic? Remember the Thief titles, with their sneaky sandbox missions and amoral positioning? Dishonored does.</p> <p>Co-designed by Harvey Smith, a graduate of Spector's Ion Storm studio, this vastly ambitious steam punk odyssey provides us with an intricately realised universe and provides us with a multitude of tools in which to explore and manipulate it. In short, Dishonored promises to bring the player back into the creative equation. The sandbox is open again. </p> <p>If you've managed to miss all the background on Dishonored so far, here's a short primer. The game is set in the seamy, cursed city of Dunwall, a Victorian futuristic megaplex of grimy brick tenements and weird steam-driven industrial infrastructures. Lead character Corvo Atano, once the most respected bodyguard of the empress, has been framed for her murder and now a dictator, the Lord Regent, has set up a regime of supression and darkness (think Bioshock, or Terry Gilliam's Brazil).</p> <p>Atano wants revenge, and to get it, he becomes an assassin, stalking the stinking streets, loaded with weapons and magical powers \u2013 all customisable by the player. </p> <p>At Gamescom, Bethesda had one mission playable \u2013 Lady Boyle's Last Party. Here, Atano must discover and murder one of the three Boyle sisters during a masked ball at their family's lavish castle. You don't know which of the sisters is the target, so searching the building for clues and talking to other guests is your main priority. The key is in hiding your true intentions \u2013 one slip and the castle guards will be alerted to your true identity.</p> <p>Atano approaches the castle by boat along a fetid canal, and the first task is to slip in unnoticed. The street is guarded by tallboys, stilted soldiers who loom over the streets, armed with incendiary arrows \u2013 they're an amazing concept, part Victorian bobby, part circus performer, and they suggest artist Viktor Antonov has been drawn to the movies of Jean-Pierre Jeunet for inspiration.</p> <p>As with the classic Thief titles, there are multiple choices \u2013 here, and throughout the level. Taking the guards down is an option \u2013 Atano has his own collection of ranged and melee weapons \u2013 but it's better to work out their patrol patterns and slip by unnoticed.</p> <p>Heading one way will lead you into an abandoned building, the other will get you to the gates of the castle, each with their own problems and opportunities. This is the way of the game \u2013 it sets up the world, and invites you in as an agent, not a dumb tourist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394851848\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/17/1345207799382/Dishonored-004.jpg\" alt=\"Dishonored\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dishonored</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I take the route to the castle gates, and spot a group of aristocrats chatting outside. Maybe I could take one out? I wait, plotting in the shadows, when one drops her invitation to the party, it blows along the street and I grab it, showing it to the moustached doorman. I'm in. </p> <p>The masked ball is a wonderful dramatic conceit \u2013 as guests pass, they comment on my appearance, congratulating me on my resemblance to Atano. Inside, the interior design is Victoriam ancestral pile mixed with fantastical steam punk trappings.</p> <p>There is lavish furniture, there are candles flickering beneath vast family portraits, but there is also an electrical forcefield guarding the castle's upper floor \u2013 out of bounds to guests. As Atano stroills through the party, picking at the vast feast, chatting to guests (using the Square button to prompt them to speak), he also encounters the Boyle sisters, dressed in differently coloured versions of the same spooky Edwardian costumes. Which is the target? Who is to die tonight?</p> <p>And beautifully, from here, everything is open, and the possibilities are many. Along with his weapons, Atano has a range of powers that can be levelled up as the game goes on. Dark Vision allows the character to see in the dark and eventuall through walls; Blink lets him teleport for short disances; Possession lets him inhabit the bodies of animals, and later, humans.</p> <p>There is also a range of Enhancements, which augment Atano's health, endurance and adrenaline. Then you have a huge range of gadets and resources to collect, and discovering bone charms will boost special powers for limited periods. </p> <p>The set up is overwhelming, complex and multifaceted and gamers will want to spend hours experimenting with combinations, figuring out their own style of play, their own version of Atano. Again, this is the realm of Deus Ex \u2013 the concept of game character as mouldable avatar for the player, rather than a set character to be merely progressed through a limited chain of customisations. </p> <p>So I wonder from room to room, catching snippets of conversation \u2013 the town is infested with rats; a moral decay is gnawing away at society, but the gentry is trying to carry on under its new leadership, scrabbling for order. Developer Arkane has created its own take on the British Empire, all stiff-upper lips and blind subservience to a warped political ideal; all trying to ignore the pestilence encroaching from the slimy streets outside. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394851849\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/17/1345207729380/Dishonored-004.jpg\" alt=\"Dishonored\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dishonored</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During brief snippets of dialogue, I pick up on the fact that there are clues in the bedrooms upstairs, if I could only get past that forcefield and the homicidal guards. And there are lots of ways. There are rats sniffing about the place; possessing one of them and bolting in through a grate into the wall structure might get me up there. Or I could go into the courtyard and try to Blink onto an upper balcony. Or it's possible to create some sort of diversion to just run up the main stairs. The possibilities go on.</p> <p>Half an hour later, and the demo is over. I've scratched the surface of the level, strolling about, listening to the chamber music echo through the halls, listening in on private chats. At one point a man approaches me claiming to be in love with one of the Boyle sisters, he's wearing a weird straw mask, resembling something from the Wicker Man. He says that if I bring the target sister to him unharmed, he will lock her away with him. No one will know.</p> <p>It is sinister and unsettling, but his mission is logged in my inventory, if I should wish to accept it. Along the way I also get embroiled in a dual \u2013 the idiotic rivalries of society's upper echelons continuing amid the city's decline.</p> <p>Dishonored looks to be a dark, intricate and incredibly ambitious game. Its sense of style, of setting, of thematic and visual unity is enormously impressive. It exudes depth, not just in its vast selection of abilities and possibilties, but in its realisation of a functioning world.</p> <p>This is a game of the year contender; and in its apparent offer of a world that can be bent to the wills of every player, it promises a truly intelligent action adventure. In this sense, Dishonored is both a link back to Deus Ex and forward toward a future of genuine sandbox design.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Dishonored will be released on PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 in October</em></p>",
  "<p>The new football season has been offered a simple challenge: Follow That! Its task is Olympian. With the glories of London 2012 so fresh in the memory it will be hard to get worked up about Reading against Stoke. How can the Premier League hope to reproduce a moment comparable to Mo Farah surging away from the field in the 5,000m to win his second gold medal or the roars of the crowd willing him on?</p> <p>The advent of another football campaign less than a week after the closing ceremony at the Olympics has prompted many a critical sigh. So it's back to the diving, the dissent and the disagreeable language, the histrionics of the players and the humbug of losing managers. If London 2012 has left the nation a feelgood factor football can be relied on to dismiss this with a cynical wave.</p> <p>Then again the Games, by holding the country in thrall for a fortnight, did manage to sideline the usual overhyped buildup to the season. This time football has returned almost as an afterthought. At least nobody should have grown weary of it before the kick-off. When Usain Bolt was in full cry who really cared about where Robin van Persie was going ?</p> <p>Yet last season did leave a half-decent football legacy. There could not have been a better climax to the Premier League than that final afternoon when within the space of two or three minutes of stoppage time a title heading for Manchester United was snatched from them by Manchester City as Edin Dzeko and Sergio Ag\u00fcero turned a looming defeat by Queens Park Rangers into a 3-2 win.</p> <p>And Chelsea will re-enter the Champions League this season as holders, having eliminated Barcelona, the world's best team, in the semi-finals and then beaten Bayern Munich on their own ground in the final. All right Roberto Di Matteo's team gained few plaudits for artisitc impression having spent most of the time enveloping the opposition in a defence as dully efficient as an old army blanket. But it worked and Didier Drogba's coolly taken penalty which won the shootout in Munich was as fine a piece of theatre as anything that occurred in London 2012.</p> <p>One of the best things about the Games was the friendly atmosphere at the venues and generosity of spirit that accompanied the events, whoever was winning. The British spectators might roar on Team GB but the warmth of their appreciation for other nations was in stark contrast to the routine booing of the opposition's anthem when England are playing football.</p> <p>This is not going to go away. Football support will always divide on tribal lines. After England had won the World Cup in 1966 their West Ham trio of Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters became national icons but the following season it was not long before they were being booed by rival fans wanting to take them down a peg or two. \"Bobby Moore, superstar, walks like a woman and wears a bra,\" they sang. Pathetic yet inevitable.</p> <p>The game needs not another Respect campaign but one to encourage more self-respect. Too often good team performances are let down by the inability of players to control themselves. Chelsea's heroic stand at Camp Nou followed the dismissal of John Terry for a gormless foul that left them with 10 men against Lionel Messi et al. Manchester City's dramatic win over QPR was assisted by the departure of Rangers' Joey Barton, who was sent off fighting as he went.</p> <p>Terry, cleared in court of racially abusing QPR's Anton Ferdinand, still faces action from the Football Association for using foul language. In the heat of the moment footballers are never going to say \"Oh botheration\" and leave it at that but the game could do worse then heed the most recent Olympians' good manners, win or lose.</p> <p>After the 1948 Olympics in London aggregate league attendances the following season set a record of 41.2 million, which has never been beaten. Players were paid the equivalent of a factory wage without the overtime but enjoyed a better public standing than they do now.</p> <p>Bradley Wiggins is worth millions but his self-effacing demeanour is reminiscent of the footballers of those days. If a Premier League footballer ever competed in the Tour de France he would have to ride a tandem to accommodate his agent.</p>",

  "<p>Compared with what's going on in other people's courts, Britain's domestic judicial problems, our ghoulish fascination with the 50-year-old <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/aug/17/moors-murderer-ian-brady-arrest\" title=\"\">Moors murders</a> and even <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-asylum-uk-ecuador\" title=\"\">Julian Assange's extradition fight</a>, are relatively small beer. Across the former Soviet bloc and into nominally communist China we are witnessing dramatic battles to separate justice from politics.</p> <p>That fight is never over as disparate supporters of the WikiLeaks founder and countless other self-styled politicals have insisted down the years, sometimes rightly. Tony Blair felt persecuted by the Metropolitan police even in Downing Street, and this month Standard Chartered bank felt ill-used by what it sees as quasi-political regulatory threats in New York.</p> <p>But the principle that judges should be independent \u2013 \"as long as they behave themselves\" \u2013 was entrenched in English statute law as long ago as 1702. \"Be ye ever so mighty, the law is above you\", as someone put it a few years later. That precept should protect Assange from the wrath of the White House, though it has mostly failed over Guant\u00e1namo Bay.</p> <p>The rules are not so secure in China or Russia; shaky, too, in not-so-different cases which mingle politics and the courtroom in Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Ukraine \u2013 all former Soviet satellites and neighbours, three of them EU members, all struggling to establish proper boundaries or (it depends who's talking) to undermine them.</p> <p>They command fewer headlines than Gu Kailai, confessed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/09/gu-kailai-murder-trial-neil-heywood\" title=\"\">murderer</a> of Neil Heywood in a Chinese hotel room, or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/16/pussy-riot-putin-russia-court-verdict\" title=\"\">Moscow's punk band trio</a>, but are hugely important to their citizens, who question whether we can rely on the law to protect us from the powerful?</p> <p>Is it a gloomy no-win situation? Of course not. Greater transparency is always painful and can mislead people into thinking things are getting worse, because crimes or scandals are being exposed when previously they were covered up.</p> <p>So the glamorous Pussy Riot defenders are surely wrong historically when they say their trial for anti-Putin \"hooliganism\" in a cathedral is a Stalinist show trial. Under Stalin most such trials took place in secrecy, unbeknown to foreign correspondents working a few streets away, imperious to criticism or rebuttal.</p> <p>Pussy Riot are on much stronger ground when they assert that \u2013 despite today's inevitable guilty verdict \u2013 they have beaten the politically manipulated judicial machine by the force of their arguments and their personalities.</p> <p>\"Now the whole world sees that the criminal case against us has been fabricated,\" they asserted in court. It has all happened in public \u2013 too hard to hide in the wired world of today \u2013 and a host of global rock royalty whom Vladimir Putin cannot harm is on their side. It might be prudent for Madonna and Macca to check their tea for polonium, all the same, because Russia seems to be slipping back into lawless ways which will do it no good.</p> <p>Is China inching slowly in the opposite direction? Whatever has been going on in the closed-but-not-quite-secret Hefei intermediate people's court in China these past few weeks \u2013 the trial of disgraced politician Bo Xilai's wife for murder \u2013 it is all but impossible to establish at this time and distance what the real story is. In terms of the facts of the case and its wider meaning for the political direction of China there is only speculation. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/17/gu-kailai-verdict-monday\" title=\"\">official verdict</a> is expected next week.</p> <p>Was the Harrow-educated expat and middleman facilitator, Heywood, a greedy blackmailer, who threatened Gu's only son (he had earlier helped get him into Harrow) when a lucrative business deal went wrong, as the official narrative states. Or was he someone disposed of because he threatened to expose high-level corruption? Would the case have come to court at all \u2013 the British embassy did not over-exert itself after Heywood was found dead of a \"heart attack\" \u2013 had not Wang Lijun, the local police chief, taken Assange-style refuge in a US consulate, claiming his life was at risk as a whistleblower?</p> <p>And is the decision to prosecute Gu in this high-profile way simply a byproduct of high politics and the urgent need to kill off the challenge to the Beijing leadership of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Xilai\" title=\"\">Mr Gu, aka Bo Xilai</a>, the ambitious mega-city boss in Chongqing and Mao-era revivalist, who had been using populist policies (curbing mafia gangs and promoting equality) to advance his claims for promotion to the politburo's standing committee?</p> <p>Bo's name has not been mentioned in court, but it is corruption charges he faces, not promotion, if it suits the party to press home its advantage. A handful of Maoist supporters are reported to have been demonstrating outside the court (do they have public school leftists in China now?), which may tell us more about the authorities' wish to have their notoriously opaque legal system look \" normal\" to outsiders than anything else. British diplomats, but no reporters, have been allowed in.</p> <p>So the Chinese trial is more akin to the running dramas in Ukraine \u2013 where jailed former prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, faces fresh charges of corruption and even complicity in murder \u2013 and in Romania's standoff between the conservative president, ex-oil-tanker captain, Traian Basescu, and the young (39) prime minister, Victor Ponta, a Blair-ish moderniser in a country where that label is not a stigma.</p> <p>As in Hungary, where the reforming prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has frightened a lot of voters with his sweeping constitutional reforms (Paul Krugman calls it an \"<a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/hungarys-constitutional-revolution/\" title=\"\">authoritarian slide</a>\" in the New York Times) since 2010, and neighbouring Bulgaria, where there is a crisis of authority in the court system, the EU has leverage here because all three are members, though not of the single currency zone.</p> <p>Each case is different. Orb\u00e1n's Fidesz party won a 68% mandate from voters in 2010 and used to make what were widely seen as extreme changes to the system, most notably by rigging the constitutional court, packing its membership, making it harder to bring cases and excluding a host of legislation from its remit. When we consider that reform of the eurozone will stand or fall on the ruling \u2013 is it legal? \u2013 of the German constitutional court the comparison is painful. Media control and rigged elections are also on the Hungarian menu.</p> <p>In Bulgaria a judge was dismissed for <a href=\"http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=141237\" title=\"\">unreasonable delays in court proceedings</a>, though actually for criticising the supreme court and the interior minister, critics say. The EU is on the case here too. But all this takes place at a time when the credit-fuelled boom years are over (sounds familiar?) and the former eastern bloc states are under pressure \u2013 also from the EU \u2013 to retrench economically and get their budgets under control.</p> <p>Times are hard and feelings run high. So in Romania, still under the shadow of the brutal and stupid Ceausescu regime, which ended in a hail of bullets in 1989, the standoff between Basescu and Ponta is also about a pro-austerity president whose party lost power after cuts in 2009 and a pro-growth social democrat who says the president should be politically neutral.</p> <p>The EU has been pressing for reform on Romania's notoriously corrupt politics since long before the country was allowed to join Nato in 2004 and the EU in 2007. A <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/29/romanians-unlikely-impeach-president-traian-basescu\" title=\"\">referendum to depose Basescu</a> was overwhelmingly carried by austerity-weary voters in July, but the supreme court has to rule on 31 August whether the necessary 50% of the electorate took part to validate it.</p> <p>Basescu's supporters say he is a genuine reformer who has backed the national anti-corruption department, which is why so many of the political elite want him out. The former prime minister Adrian Nastase, Ponta's mentor, has been jailed for corruption. In London this week <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/14/victor-ponta-romania-president-impeachment\" title=\"\">Ponta told the Guardian's Julian Borger</a> the worst was over and the pair might yet \"cohabit\" if Basescu behaves.</p> <p>Tricky, isn't it? In countries which for the most part lack settled traditions of respect for courts and constitutions, both sides stand accused of manipulating the system for political gain. It is a huge distraction from urgent economic tasks and threatens to deepen voter disillusion. Even in seemingly all-powerful Beijing, party bosses know ordinary Chinese are angry with elite corruption and the frailty of its justice.</p> <p>But the outside world knows more about these proceedings than we would have done in past times. That's progress. Our legal battles nearer home show there is no room to be smug \u2013 but also that we are luckier than we sometimes remember to remember. The rule of law is the anchor for most of what we have.</p>",
  "<p>Imagine a therapy that \"<a href=\"http://www.scientology.org/faq/scientology-and-dianetics-auditing/what-is-the-purification-rundown.html\" title=\"\">enables an individual to rid himself of the harmful effects of drugs, toxins and other chemicals that lodge in the body and create a biochemical barrier to spiritual well-being</a>\". If you were told that the treatment was entirely natural and had already \"enabled hundreds of thousands to free themselves from the harmful effects of drugs and toxins and so achieve spiritual gains\", wouldn't you be tempted to try it?</p> <p>Who doesn't want a body free of nasty chemicals? And who wouldn't be delighted at the chance to counter a growing threat to an \"advancement in mental \u2026 wellbeing\"?</p> <p>These claims are being made for the \"Purification Rundown\" (\"Purif\" for short) and the closely related Narconon detox programmes, which mainly consist of regular exercise, sauna and nutrition, with industrial doses of vitamins and minerals added for good measure. Some of the claims are quite specific: the <a href=\"http://clearbodyclearmind.com/faq.shtml\" title=\"\">Purif programme is supposed to</a> increase your IQ, reduce the level of cancer-causing agents in your body, and even enable you to lose weight easily and quickly. The Narconon programme is more specifically targeted at drug and alcohol dependency and is claimed to have an <a href=\"http://www.narconon.org/about-narconon/results.html\" title=\"\">impressive success rate of 75%</a>.</p> <p>Both programmes were developed by L Ron Hubbard (1911-1986) and are currently marketed by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purification_Rundown\" title=\"\">Church of Scientology</a>. The CoS is not generally known to be an organisation that promotes healthcare programmes. Hubbard, the pulp-fiction writer who founded the CoS, portrayed himself somewhat over-optimistically as a pioneer, innovator and nuclear physicist.</p> <p>He taught his followers that, at their core, humans contain a \"thetan\". After creating the universe, thetans accidentally became trapped in physical bodies and, through scientology, we can restore the immortal, omnipotent, god-like powers of the \"thetan\" within us. Weird stuff that is the preserve of Hollywood eccentrics, you might think, but perhaps the CoS's detox-ventures are an attempt to conquer new territory?</p> <p>After years of clever promotion, the CoS detox programmes are now becoming popular in many countries, including the UK. They bring in good money. In 2009, the CoS was <a href=\"http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_12078368\" title=\"\">reported to charge $5,200 (\u00a33,300) for the Purif programme</a> and the price for the Narconon programme is reportedly even higher.</p> <p>A typical course of treatment lasts several weeks and consists of many hours of exercise and sauna every day. This regimen is supplemented with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purification_Rundown\" title=\"\">megadoses of vitamins and minerals</a>, which can cause problems. Niacin, one vitamin that is given in high doses as part of the regimen, can be particularly dangerous. The <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/924.html\" title=\"\">US National Institutes of Health warns that</a> at high doses it can cause \"liver problems, gout, ulcers of the digestive tract, loss of vision, high blood sugar, irregular heartbeat, and other serious problems.\" It should not be taken by people who already have liver damage.</p> <p>Seven fatalities of people undergoing the Narconon programme are <a href=\"http://www.thefix.com/content/narconon-deaths\" title=\"\">currently being investigated in Oklahoma</a>, although the CoS says these deaths are not connected with the treatment regimen itself.</p> <p>Whatever the truth regarding these deaths, <a href=\"http://www.kunnskapssenteret.no/Publikasjoner/_attachment/4311?_ts=11d719f7891&amp;download=true\" title=\"\">a review of the evidence</a> about the treatment regimen's effectiveness \u2013 carried out by the Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services in 2008 \u2013 found no good evidence that the Narconon programme works:</p> <blockquote> <p>There is currently no reliable evidence for the effectiveness of Narconon as a primary or secondary drug prevention program. This is partly due to the insufficient research evidence about Narconon and partly due to the non-experimental nature of the few studies that exist. </p> </blockquote> <p>The claim that such detox treatments eliminate toxins from the body is, of course, easily testable. All we would need to do is define what toxin we are talking about and measure the change in levels of that toxin compared with a control group of volunteers who did not receive the detox.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22297655\" title=\"\">But such studies are not available</a>. Why? Do the marketing men believe in their own claims? Maybe they feel that profits and evidence are like fire and water? Or possibly the thetans have an aversion to science?</p> <p>If you think that the Purif, Narconon or any other form of alternative detox eliminates toxins, you might be mistaken. Most clients have lost some money, many have lost their ability to think straight, some may even have lost their lives. But there is no reliable evidence that they have actually lost any toxins.</p>",
  "<p>\"To what degree are parents responsible for rapidly rising rates of child overweight and obesity? Are parents of severely obese children guilty of child abuse? These questions <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19267308\" title=\"\">are raised</a> in this week's BBC Radio 4 Report, which discusses cases where morbid obesity has prompted local authorities to take children into care.</p> <p>Comparing Britain with France sheds interesting light on this question of parental responsibility. British children are twice as likely as French children to be overweight or obese. Indeed, France has one of the lowest rates of overweight children in the developed world, and Britain one of the highest. Are British parents to blame?</p> <p>The answer is complicated, because the causes of obesity are complex: physical activity, poverty, \"<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/18929190\" title=\"\">food deserts</a>\", genetics and obesogenic chemicals all play a role. But what our children eat is undoubtedly a factor, particularly in terms of what scientists term a \"positive energy balance\": too many calories in and too few out.</p> <p>This is where parenting styles \u2013 and food culture \u2013 are relevant. It's no coincidence that random snacking (or \"grazing\") is traditionally frowned upon in France. The majority of French children snack only once a day at the late-afternoon <em>go\u00fbter</em>, and otherwise are expected to wait patiently until their next meal \u2013 which they generally do, having been taught to know the difference between having an empty stomach and truly feeling hungry.</p> <p>French parents teach their children to listen to their own hunger cues and to limit portion sizes. Parents will ask, \"Are you still feeling hungry?\" rather than, \"Are you full?\" \u2013 a subtle but important distinction. Traditional long, slow meals (most schools have a two-hour lunch break) also helps children learn to listen to their own \"fullness feelings\", as satiety signals take more than 20 minutes to reach our brains from our stomachs. The paradox: just like their parents, French children spend a longer time eating than ours, but eat less.</p> <p>And that's not all: they eat more veggies, but appear to enjoy it more. Studies have shown that French mothers introduce a far greater diversity of foods to infants (paediatricians recommend leek soup for infants!). The proof is in French school lunches, which feature foods such as beetroot salad and butter beans, grated carrot salad and cauliflower casserole, endive and even escargots.</p> <p>This suggests that French parents can't claim all the credit. Healthy eating is included in the school curriculum: \"tasting week\" classes introduce children to new foods. Lunch menus (following ministry of education regulations) can't include the same dish more than once a month, so that children are exposed to variety. Most school lunch desserts are simply fresh fruit, children drink water (no sweetened drinks are available, and <a href=\"www.just-drinks.com/news/school-vending-machine-ban-takes-effect_id82902.aspx\" title=\"\">vending machines are banned</a> in all schools), fried foods are served only a few times a month, and ketchup is allowed a maximum of once a week \u2013 and only with foods with which it is traditionally eaten.</p> <p>Why all of these rules? The French believe that teaching children to eat is as important as teaching them to read. In fact, eating well is one of the first skills that parents teach children, from weaning onwards.</p> <p>They believe that healthy eating starts at home. But they also believe that even well-intentioned parents find it difficult to counteract food marketing, poor quality school lunches, and a \"grab and go\" food culture in which snacking is increasingly the norm. This is why France has a \"soda tax\" on soft drinks, and why television advertisements for snack foods carry a warning: \"For your health, avoid snacking in between meals.\" Sounds silly? The French-speaking Canadian province of Quebec is the only jurisdiction to have banned TV food marketing to children, and it has one of the lowest rates of child obesity in North America, despite a high rate of sedentary behaviour amongst children in Quebec.</p> <p>The French example suggests we should acknowledge parental responsibility for creating a family food culture in which children are taught \u2013 and enabled \u2013 to eat healthily. This is true for all of us, not only in cases of morbid obesity (which can be as life-threatening as under-nutrition and which, in my opinion, might justifiably be considered child abuse in some instances).</p> <p>But many aspects of our unhealthy food culture are beyond the control of individual parents. Many of these are profit-driven, supported by corporate lobbies that have little interest in children consuming less food, or fewer processed foods \u2013 which is precisely what they should be doing. In response, we need changes to the school curriculum and school lunches, controls on food marketing, higher nutritional standards for foods targeted at children, and state intervention to ensure accessibility of healthy foods \u2013 rather than cheap, calorie-rich, but nutrient-poor foods \u2013 for those living in poverty. These actions are beyond the scope of individual parents but without them, the child obesity epidemic will continue.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 August 2012. The original said that the French-speaking Canadian province of Quebec has the lowest rates of child obesity in North America, rather than one of the lowest rates. This has been corrected.</p>",

She said the strikers had not dispersed earlier, despite police use of water cannon and stun grenades.</p> <p>Police have been accused of a massacre after shooting at the mine workers on Thursday in one of the bloodiest days of protest in South Africa since the end of apartheid.</p> <p>President Jacob Zuma is returning from a regional summit in neighbouring Mozambique to address the crisis that is seen as deepening the rift between his scandal-plagued ruling party and an increasingly angry electorate confronting massive unemployment, poverty and inequality.</p> <p>In scenes that evoked memories of some of the country's darkest days, national television showed pictures of police in helmets and body armour shooting at workers amid shouting, panic and clouds of dust at the mine, owned by the company Lonmin. After three minutes of gunfire, bodies littered the ground in pools of blood.</p> <p>Newspaper reporter Poloko Tau tweeted from the scene: \"Auto guns creacking [sic] and cocked like 100 at a time, scary \u2026 warzone down here, 1st shot fired \u2026 journalist running, diving and hiding amid shots, water canon spewing water at the strikers \u2026 my contact has just been shot dead \u2026\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394870114\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/8/17/1345222369938/South-Africa-mine-001.png\" alt=\"South Africa mine\" width=\"220\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South Africa mine Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The deaths came after a week of turmoil at the Marikana mine that had already seen 10 people killed, including two police officers and two security guards. Lonmin, the world's third biggest platinum producer, was forced to suspend production at the mine, about 60 miles north-west of Johannesburg, after what it called an illegal strike escalated into an alleged turf war between rival unions.</p> <p>His voice shaking with anger, the union leader Joseph Mathunjwa on Thursday accused the Lonmin management of colluding with a rival union to orchestrate what he described as a massacre. Mathunjwa, president of the militant Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU), told the eNews channel: \"We have to send condolences to those families whose members were brutally murdered by a lack of co-operation from management. We have done our bit. If the management had changed their commitment, surely lives could have been saved.\"</p> <p>Zuma, speaking on Thursday, condemned the killings but made no reference to the handling of the situation by the police. \"We are shocked and dismayed at this senseless violence,\" he said. \"We believe there is enough space in our democratic order for any dispute to be resolved through dialogue without any breaches of the law or violence.\"</p> <p>The opposition called for an independent investigation. Helen Zille, leader of the Democratic Alliance, said: \"We call on union leaders, the police and everyone else involved to immediately work towards a de-escalation of the conflict. All action must be taken to avoid further bloodshed.</p> <p>\"An urgent independent investigation is required to determine exactly what happened; and who is responsible for this massacre. The families of everyone involved, and indeed the nation, deserve to know how and why this bloodshed occurred.\"</p> <p>Roger Phillimore, the chairman of Lonmin, said: \"The South African police service have been in charge of public order and safety on the ground since the violence between competing labour factions erupted over the weekend, claiming the lives of eight of our employees and two police officers.</p> <p>\"It goes without saying that we deeply regret the further loss of life in what is clearly a public order rather than labour relations-associated matter.\"</p> <p>The violence reportedly flared when police laying out barricades of barbed wire were outflanked by some of an estimated 3,000 miners massed on a rocky outcrop near the mine. Witnesses claimed that some of the miners were armed with pistols and fired first, while also charging the police with machetes and sticks.</p> <p>The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) said: \"According to a Sapa [South African Press Association] report, police tried to disperse striking workers gathered on top of a hill, wielding pangas and chanting war songs. It ended in a three-minute shootout between the two groups, after police fired teargas and then used a water cannon to disperse the strikers, who retaliated by firing live ammunition at the police.\"</p> <p>The protests began last week when workers demanded a pay increase to 12,500 rand (\u00a3976) a month. The action turned deadly when the AMCU clashed with South Africa's dominant National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).</p> <p>The NUM rejected the charge of collusion with mine bosses. Spokesman Lesiba Seshoka said: \"We are not surprised by his allegation \u2026 It is not true. Everyone can see through these lies.\"</p> <p>Seshoka blamed the AMCU \u2013 which has been poaching NUM members in platinum mines \u2013 for instigating the bloodshed. \"These people said today they want to die on the hilltop. They said they will bring their children to die there. That is why we say the ringleaders must be arrested.\"</p> <p>There has been growing frustration with the governing African National Congress and its mainstream union allies for moving too slowly to deliver wage increases and public services. Radical and militant voices are making gains in some areas.</p> <p>Patrick Craven, the national spokesman for Cosatu, which is aligned with the ANC, said it would \"convene an urgent meeting of the unions' leaderships to discuss what is emerging as a co-ordinated political strategy to use intimidation and violence, manipulated by disgruntled former union leaders, in a concerted drive to create breakaway 'unions' and divide and weaken the trade union movement\".</p> <p>He added: \"Cosatu calls upon all workers to remain vigilant but calm in the face of the most serious challenge to workers' unity and strength for many years.\"</p> <p>South Africa is home to four-fifths of the world's known platinum reserves but has been hit by union militancy and a sharp drop in the price of the precious metal this year. At least three people were killed in fighting in January that led to a six-week closure of the world's biggest platinum mine, run by Impala Platinum. Such incidents are seen as tarnishing South Africa's reputation among investors.</p> <p>This week's violence has forced Lonmin to freeze production at all its South African operations, which account for 12% of global platinum output. The company's London-listed shares fell more than 7% on Thursday. A spokesman at Lonmin's head office in London confirmed strikers had been served with an ultimatum to return to work on Thursday or face dismissal, but denied that might inflame the situation.</p> <p>\"The mine cannot operate without the rock drill operators,\" he said. \"The company tried every avenue it could to negotiate a settlement and we were left with no option.\"</p>",

  "<p>Playing SimCity used to be rather an isolating endeavour, enjoyed alone in vast stints of town planning and disaster management. But the idea of fans beavering away alone on their virtual cityscapes is an unattractive one in our socially connected era. EA wants to bring us together. So like Need For Speed and Battlefield before it, the latest incarnation of the game is getting a social layer \u2013 and it does sound rather intriguing. </p> <p>At its pre-Gamescom press briefing on Tueday evening, EA announced SimCity World, a whole suite of online connectivity features. While building their own towns, players will get to check a City Log showing the progress of any friends also playing the game. A news feed on the menu screen shows when pals have, say, founded a new region or perhaps completed a major building project, and all of these messages are interactive, so you can compare the progress made by friends with your own ambitions.</p> <p>On top of this, there will be regular challenges for the whole SimCity community. Some are collaborative, inviting players to work together to create one million jhobs in their respective games within a set period of time. Other tasks are competitive, with players challanged to get their own cities to one million inhabitants before all the others. </p> <p>Most intriguingly though, all cities will be linked via a global financial exchange which will see prices of key in-game resources like oil and food fluctuate with real demand. So if everyone in SimCity is building oil refineries, then demand drops and the price goes down. The ramifications will be profound, forcing players to think as part of a world market rather than as an isolated city state. It's fascinating stuff. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zD0nyi0S27Y?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zD0nyi0S27Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It will also be interesting to see how this affects the game's concept of regions, in which friends can connect with several other cities online, forming an interdependent co-operative. Cities within regions can share workers, power and other resources, as well as work on major group projects, like creating airports, which help the local economies. While SimCity used to be great at teaching us about how individual cities operate and flourish, it looks like the newest version of the game will show us how all urban centres around the world actually co-exist together in symbiosis. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the game looks lovely. A short hands-on session at Gamescom showed off the beautiful, slightly stylised visuals, the camera seamlessly swooping in and out on the action with simple mouse moves and button presses. Every where you look there are visual representations of how the city is fairing, from smiling faces hovering over houses, to crowds protesting outside city hall. The new GlassBox simulation engine also makes it easy to open up data layers. After I built a sewage plant, for example, the effectiveness of my new system is shown via images of poo flowing down the city streets. Lovely. </p> <p>Having the ability to zoom in right to street level and see the individual sims going about their business is a real treat. Using the building tools is as intuitive as ever, with the ability to add curved roads possibly leading to more imaginative designs \u2013 though I struggled at times getting my gridded and curved roads to meet neatly. I'm sure I'll get a heck of a lot more practise.</p> <p>The announcement of a Mac version, available via Origin, is good news \u2013 except for those gamers who remain skeptical about, and resiliant to, EA's alternative to third-party digital game services like Steam. But really, the key thing here is that SimCity has been re-thought for a more connected generation without junking any of its old depth or charm. Our demo ends with a massive meteor storm, blasting chunks out of my carefully structure residental zones and commercial areas. Although respectful of the past, Maxis, like SimCity itself, isn't afraid of dramatic change.<br><em><br>SimCity is out in February 2013 on PC and Mac.</em></p>",
  "<p>Below the jump, I mention the books that I received recently in the mail. These are the books that I may review in more depth later, either here or in print somewhere in the world. </p> <p> </p> <p>When I get new books, I like to share them with people. Unfortunately, you are all so far away, so I cannot host a book party in my crib where you can look over these books, so I'll do the next best thing. I'll host a book party on my blog each Friday of the week when books arrive by giving you my quick \"first impression\" of them along with relevant links so you can get a copy of the book if you wish. </p> <h2>Books that arrived this week:</h2> <p> Physiological Adaptations for Breeding in Birds by Tony D. Williams [Princeton University Press; 2012: <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780691139821\">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691139822/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>/<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007BOK00S/livithescieli-21/\">kindle</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691139822/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>/<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007BOK00S/livingthescie-20/\">kindle</a>] <br><strong>In-depth description:</strong> Physiological Adaptations for Breeding in Birds is the most current and comprehensive account of research on avian reproduction. It develops two unique themes: the consideration of female avian reproductive physiology and ecology, and an emphasis on individual variation in life-history traits. Tony Williams investigates the physiological, metabolic, energetic, and hormonal mechanisms that underpin individual variation in the key female-specific reproductive traits and the trade-offs between these traits that determine variation in fitness.<br>The core of the book deals with the avian reproductive cycle, from seasonal gonadal development, through egg laying and incubation, to chick rearing. Reproduction is considered in the context of the annual cycle and through an individual's entire life history. The book focuses on timing of breeding, clutch size, egg size and egg quality, and parental care. It also provides a primer on female reproductive physiology and considers trade-offs and carryover effects between reproduction and other life-history stages. In each chapter, Williams describes individual variation in the trait of interest and the evolutionary context for trait variation. He argues that there is only a rudimentary, and in some cases nonexistent, understanding of the physiological mechanisms that underpin individual variation in the major reproductive life-history traits, and that research efforts should refocus on these key unresolved problems by incorporating detailed physiological studies into existing long-term population studies, generating a new synthesis of physiology, ecology, and evolutionary biology.<br><strong>My first impression:</strong> The topic of this book was the topic of my dissertation, so when I saw it, I was determined to get my hands on it as soon as possible. But my friends at PUP are looking out for me: the book arrived a few days ago without me having to email them, pleading for a copy of this title. And what a delight it is! This is such a beautiful book: each chapter presents and reviews research data in easy-to-read language and -- my favourite feature -- each chapter ends by asking a series of future research questions. Seriously; how wonderful is that? Birders and serious aviculturists will learn much from this book, but I think that ornithologists and especially grad students and postdocs will be inspired by this lovely book. But its appeal doesn't end there: even my statistician spouse, who studies climate change, is determined to wrest this book from me. </p> <p> How to Build a Habitable Planet: The Story of Earth from the Big Bang to Humankind (Revised and Expanded Edition) by Charles H. Langmuir and Wally Broecker [Princeton University Press; 2012: <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780691140063\">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691140065/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691140065/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>] <br><strong>In-depth description:</strong> Since its first publication more than twenty-five years ago, How to Build a Habitable Planet has established a legendary reputation as an accessible yet scientifically impeccable introduction to the origin and evolution of Earth, from the Big Bang through the rise of human civilization. This classic account of how our habitable planet was assembled from the stuff of stars introduced readers to planetary, Earth, and climate science by way of a fascinating narrative. Now this great book has been made even better. Harvard geochemist Charles Langmuir has worked closely with the original author, Wally Broecker, one of the world's leading Earth scientists, to revise and expand the book for a new generation of readers for whom active planetary stewardship is becoming imperative.<br>Interweaving physics, astronomy, chemistry, geology, and biology, this sweeping account tells Earth's complete story, from the synthesis of chemical elements in stars, to the formation of the Solar System, to the evolution of a habitable climate on Earth, to the origin of life and humankind. The book also addresses the search for other habitable worlds in the Milky Way and contemplates whether Earth will remain habitable as our influence on global climate grows. It concludes by considering the ways in which humankind can sustain Earth's habitability and perhaps even participate in further planetary evolution.<br>Like no other book, How to Build a Habitable Planet provides an understanding of Earth in its broadest context, as well as a greater appreciation of its possibly rare ability to sustain life over geologic time.<br><strong>My first impression:</strong> This book is a monster. More than 700 pages long, it has 21 chapters that deal with a variety of important topics from the Big Bang, the formation of organic and inorganic molecules, formation of the Earth, plate tectonics, the coevolution of life and our planet, weather and climate change, the rise of humans and the question of habitability in the universe. This book is a very complete and thorough reference work, where individual chapters can provide an excellent working background for those who want to learn the fundamentals associated with a particular topic before launching into a more in-depth study of some aspect of that field. It's filled with data, diagrammes and photographs, it has a glossary and index, and each chapter has a list of useful supplementary readings. </p> <p> Higgs: The invention and discovery of the 'God Particle' by Jim Baggott [Oxford University Press; 2012: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199603499/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>/<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008L0EF2U/livithescieli-21/\">kindle</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199603499/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>/<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008L0EF2U/livingthescie-20/\">kindle</a>] <br><strong>In-depth description:</strong> The hunt for the Higgs particle has involved the biggest, most expensive experiment ever. So exactly what is this particle? Why does it matter so much? What does it tell us about the Universe? Has the discovery announced on 4 July 2012 finished the search? And was finding it really worth all the effort? The short answer is yes. The Higgs field is proposed as the way in which particles gain mass -- a fundamental property of matter. It's the strongest indicator yet that the Standard Model of physics really does reflect the basic building blocks of our Universe. Little wonder the hunt and discovery of this new particle has produced such intense media interest. Here, Jim Baggott explains the science behind the discovery, looking at how the concept of a Higgs field was invented, how the vast experiment was carried out, and its implications on our understanding of all mass in the Universe. The book was written over the eighteen months of the CERN Large Hadron Collider experiment, with its final chapter rounded off on the day of the announcement 'that a particle consistent with the standard model Higgs boson has been discovered.'<br><strong>My first impression:</strong> This is the uncorrected proofs of a book that is not scheduled to be released until (probably) September 2012, so it really isn't fair to say much about my impression of this book. However, the grand theme of this book is an exploration of the Higgs Boson -- its recent discovery and the evidence that we discovered it, how this particle's existence was predicted and what are the implications of this discovery. Several chapters have already been formally reviewed by the media and more reviews of this book -- from the uncorrected proofs -- are appearing every day. Written by a former university physics lecturer who now is a freelance science writer, this timely book promises to be interesting and educational. </p> <p> Affluence and Influence: Economic Inequality and Political Power in America by Martin Gilens [Princeton University Press; 2012: <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780691153971\">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691153973/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>/<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008AU9LZM/livithescieli-21/\">kindle</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691153973/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>/<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008AU9LZM/livingthescie-20/\">kindle</a>] <br><strong>In-depth description:</strong> Can a country be a democracy if its government only responds to the preferences of the rich? In an ideal democracy, all citizens should have equal influence on government policy -- but as this book demonstrates, America's policymakers respond almost exclusively to the preferences of the economically advantaged. Affluence and Influence definitively explores how political inequality in the United States has evolved over the last several decades and how this growing disparity has been shaped by interest groups, parties, and elections.<br>With sharp analysis and an impressive range of data, Martin Gilens looks at thousands of proposed policy changes, and the degree of support for each among poor, middle-class, and affluent Americans. His findings are staggering: when preferences of low- or middle-income Americans diverge from those of the affluent, there is virtually no relationship between policy outcomes and the desires of less advantaged groups. In contrast, affluent Americans' preferences exhibit a substantial relationship with policy outcomes whether their preferences are shared by lower-income groups or not. Gilens shows that representational inequality is spread widely across different policy domains and time periods. Yet Gilens also shows that under specific circumstances the preferences of the middle class and, to a lesser extent, the poor, do seem to matter. In particular, impending elections -- especially presidential elections -- and an even partisan division in Congress mitigate representational inequality and boost responsiveness to the preferences of the broader public.<br>At a time when economic and political inequality in the United States only continues to rise, Affluence and Influence raises important questions about whether American democracy is truly responding to the needs of all its citizens.<br><strong>My first impression:</strong> Anyone who follows me on twitter knows that my experience of America is of a nation out of balance, of a country where the wealthy achieve their goals by exploiting and trampling the poor and working class. This leaves most Americans' experiences far removed from the bold delusion of the \"American dream\". This book asks the important question, \"is American democracy truly responding to everyone's needs?\" by examining what Americans want their government to do and what it actually does do. This compelling book is guaranteed to inspire jumping up-and-down outrage. </p> <p> Through the Eye of a Needle: Wealth, the Fall of Rome, and the Making of Christianity in the West, 350-550 AD by Peter Brown [Princeton University Press; 2012: <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780691152905\">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/069115290X/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/069115290X/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>] <br><strong>In-depth description:</strong> Jesus taught his followers that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter heaven. Yet by the time of the fall of Rome, the church was becoming rich beyond measure. Through the Eye of a Needle is a sweeping intellectual and social history of the vexing problem of wealth in Christianity in the waning days of the Roman Empire, written by the world's foremost scholar of late antiquity.<br>Peter Brown examines the rise of the church through the lens of money and the challenges it posed to an institution that espoused the virtue of poverty and called avarice the root of all evil. Drawing on the writings of major Christian thinkers such as Augustine, Ambrose, and Jerome, Brown examines the controversies and changing attitudes toward money caused by the influx of new wealth into church coffers, and describes the spectacular acts of divestment by rich donors and their growing influence in an empire beset with crisis. He shows how the use of wealth for the care of the poor competed with older forms of philanthropy deeply rooted in the Roman world, and sheds light on the ordinary people who gave away their money in hopes of treasure in heaven.<br>Through the Eye of a Needle challenges the widely held notion that Christianity's growing wealth sapped Rome of its ability to resist the barbarian invasions, and offers a fresh perspective on the social history of the church in late antiquity.<br><strong>My first impression:</strong> One of the subject areas that I read extensively about is the world's religions, particularly their histories and philosophies. I opened this book randomly to read chapter 4, \"Wealth in the Christian Church\" and found this chapter to be carefully written, heavily referenced and meticulously researched. This book describes the growing relationship between wealth and christianity, and whether this had any impact upon the fall of the Roman Empire. At more than 800 pages long, this book will certainly inspire readers to sink their teeth deeply into this topic. </p> <p>What book(s) are you reading? How far are you along in the book?

  "<p>The WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange spent a comfortable night in the Ecuadorean embassy in London after the South American country's decision <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-asylum-uk-ecuador\" title=\"\">to offer him asylum</a>, and is said to be \"doing all right\", according to a diplomatic source.</p> <p>More than a dozen Metropolitan police officers stood guard outside the redbrick Knightsbridge mansion block on Friday morning, accompanied by a handful of his supporters who are understood to be planning a show of solidarity and direct action tonight in protest at the British government's treatment of Assange.</p> <p>A strong international media presence remained behind barriers outside, where gutters were full of beer cans and coffee cups.</p> <p>One supporter, Tristan Woodwards, said he had spent the night camped out opposite the embassy to show sympathy. \"I'm here to support Julian Assange and WikiLeaks and to show my disgust at the British government's threat to a sovereign nation's embassy,\" he said. \"It's completely wrong. People talk about the [assault] allegations, but [the UK government's reaction] seems over the top for someone who's supposed to have committed a crime.\"</p> <p>Another supporter, Tammy Samede, said she had decided to keep watch on the embassy to make sure the government acted in accordance with international law. \"To be honest, I'm not a fan of the British government for a lot reasons,\" she said. \"But they're using the need to question him to get him out of here and get him to Sweden, who will extradite him to the US, who will probably imprison him forever or execute him.\"</p> <p>Samede said that while the women who had made the assault allegations had every right to due process, the case should be dealt with \"in the proper manner and not in the political manner\". She said Assange had offered to answer questions by videolink, but British authorities seemed unwilling to let him.</p> <p>Asked how long she would keep vigil, she said: \"It's not the most comfortable place, but standing up for what's right is never comfortable. That's why [Assange] is stuck in a room without a window in the embassy.\"</p>",
  "<p>The woman arrested by Greater Manchester police in connection with the Ian Brady inquiry has been the serial killer's mental health advocate for 13 years.</p> <p>Jackie Powell, 49, from south Wales, was appointed in 1999 under the Mental Health Act. Advocates are independent and from a variety of backgrounds. Sometimes they have formal qualifications \u2013 if they are a mental health nurse or social worker, for example. Often, they have relevant life skills, such as past experience dealing with mental health-related issue. It is not clear what background Powell has.</p> <p>Advocates will need to have a detailed understanding of the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/12/contents\" title=\"\">Mental Health Act</a> and Code of Practice.</p> <p>She was arrested on Thursday at an address in south Wales after an investigation by Greater Manchester police's cold-case review team on suspicion of preventing a lawful burial. Powell has since been released on bail for three months without charge.</p> <p>Her arrest was prompted by the police receiving information on 30 July from documentary-makers who had interviewed her as part of a programme about Brady that will be aired on Channel 4 on Monday night.</p> <p>The intelligence \"led officers to believe that Ian Brady has recently given details of the location of Keith Bennett's body to one of his long-time visitors\", a police spokesman said.</p> <p>Speaking to Sky News on Friday, Powell said her words had been \"blown out of all proportion\" and would not confirm if such a document existed.</p> <p>Officers said documents had been seized from the house and there was no evidence to suggest the burial site of Keith Bennett's body had been revealed. A woman arrested on suspicion of preventing the burial of a body without lawful excuse had been bailed pending further inquiries, they added. Documents seized from the address are being examined.</p> <p>The documentary-makers released a transcript of their interview with Powell in which she says: \"I received a letter and a sealed envelope which said on the front of it, to be opened in the event of my [Brady's] death. He says that he doesn't wish to take secrets to his grave and that within the sealed envelope is a letter to Winnie Johnson, and that within that is the means to her possibly being able to rest. And that's paraphrase, that's not verbatim.\"</p> <p>Asked what Brady means by that, she replies: \"Well, clearly there's something within the letter that may be able to find her son, I would suggest.\"</p>",
  "<p>More than three years after Rihanna was assaulted by Chris Brown, the singer continues to reflect the incident and its aftermath, saying she felt \"protective\" and \"concerned about\" her ex-boyfriend. \"As angry as I was \u2013 as angry and hurt and betrayed,\" Rihanna told Oprah Winfrey, \"I just felt like he made that mistake because he needed help.\"</p> <p>In the new interview, due to air in the US on Sunday, Rihanna said she was afraid of what would happen to Brown after the incident became public. \"It became a circus and I felt protective,\" the singer explained. \"Who's gonna help him?

Everybody's gonna say he's a monster without looking at the source.\"</p> <p>After initially <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/apr/07/chris-brown-pleads-not-guilty\" title=\"\">denying the charges</a>, Brown eventually <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/23/chris-brown-pleads-guilty\" title=\"\">pleaded guilty</a> to assaulting Rihanna in the early hours of 8 February 2009. According to the police report, the couple got into an argument after Rihanna found a text message on Brown's phone, sent by an ex-girlfriend. Brown tried to force Rihanna out of his car before punching her repeatedly in the face, causing bleeding. After throwing her phone out of the window, he continued to punch the pop star's arms, hands and legs, biting her ear and hands, and twice placing her in a headlock. Police were called after a witness heard Rihanna's screams.</p> <p>\"It was a weird, confusing space to be in,\" Rihanna said this week. \"I felt like the only person they [hated was] him.\" Brown, who grew up in an abusive household, was sentenced to one year's probation and domestic violence counselling. \"It was embarrassing, it was humiliating,\" Rihanna said. \"I lost my best friend. Everything I knew switched, switched in a night, and I couldn't control that.\"</p> <p>Though Brown's career initially suffered, it has since bounced back. He and Rihanna collaborated on two songs earlier this year, and the 23-year-old won his first Grammy. On Wednesday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/16/chris-brown-drake-brawl\" title=\"\">Brown was named as co-defendant</a> in a $16m (\u00a310.2m) lawsuit, brought by a New York nightclub; the owners allege Brown and the rapper Drake caused a massive brawl after arguing about Rihanna. Seven people, including a professional basketball player, were injured.</p>",
  "<p>Each week we look at two shops competing in the same sector, and review what they are offering customers: from how helpful the staff are to the best bargains on offer.</p> <p>Our review will be based on a visit to stores on the same high street, or online, so it will be just a snapshot of how the retailer is performing.</p> <p>To get a better idea of which retailers are delivering and which are falling short, we would like you to tell us about your experiences of the same shops.</p> <p>Some weeks, both stores we visit may do a good job; other weeks there will be one that stands out as being much better or worse. Your reviews will help us discover if this is a trend.</p> <p>This week, we compare bakers Greggs and Percy Ingle. The latter is a south-east chain, so please tell us about your local shops.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.greggs.co.uk/\" title=\"Greggs website\">Greggs</a></h2> <p><strong>Background</strong> The first Greggs shop opened in 1951 in Gosforth; now it's the UK's largest specialist retail bakery, its 1,600 outlets making it bigger in the UK than McDonalds. Bread is baked in the company's network of local bakeries and sandwiches are made by staff at each store. This summer it beat Subway and Pret a Manger to win the Specialist Sandwich Bar Chain of the Year award from the British Sandwich Association. As well as the notorious staples of sausage rolls and pasties, outlets sell regional specialities.</p> <p><strong>The visit</strong> 10.20am, 16 August, Enfield, Middlesex.</p> <p><strong>What it sells</strong> Bread, buns, sweet and savoury pastries, sandwiches, soft drinks and take-away tea and coffee.</p> <p><strong>First impressions</strong> This tiny outlet is so small a queue of three or more tails out on to the pavement. The window display is utilitarian: no flights of fancy here, just bags of white rolls, jam doughnuts and a fair bit of empty shelving behind three posters trumpeting meal deals. Stock shifts quickly.</p> <p><strong>What were the staff like</strong> Only one was visible on this visit. He was civil, but unsmiling, with poor English. When I asked to buy a bread roll he proffered a bagged half dozen which appeared to be the only available option.</p> <p><strong>Best bargain</strong> A \u00a33.29 meal deal of a bag of crisps, a large filled roll and a soft drink.</p> <p><strong>What does it charge? </strong>Large white sandwich loaf, \u00a31.28; large wholemeal loaf, \u00a31.32; Belgian iced bun, 65p; jam doughnut, 45p; sausage roll, 87p.</p> <p><strong>Where can I pay? </strong>One till behind the main counter and two people ahead of me, but the service was rapid and the wait less than three minutes.</p> <p><strong>Is loyalty rewarded?</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>Lasting impressions</strong> Greggs doesn't waste time on fripperies. Its stock is cheap, basic and good quality; its staff efficient but brusque; and its ambience is that of a fast food outlet. Given that this was a small store the stock was limited \u2013 a small range of familiar buns and pastries, with tiger bread the only exotica among the three shelves of white or wholemeal loaves. The shelves also empty very quickly: when I looked in an hour later almost all the loaves had gone. A whole counter was devoted to savoury pastries \u2013 sausage rolls and pasties \u2013 and a small fridge unit to a small range of unexotic sandwiches and soft drinks.</p> <p><strong>Overall rating</strong> 7/10.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.percy-ingle.co.uk/\" title=\"Percy Ingle website\">Percy Ingle</a></h2> <p><strong>Background </strong>A fifth-generation family bakery founded in east London in 1954. It now has 50 stores across London and Essex, noted for reassuringly old-fashioned ambience and products. It claims to use traditional methods in its east London bakery and only RainForest Alliance-certified tea and coffee, organic milk and free-range eggs.</p> <p><strong>The visit</strong> 11am, 16 August, Enfield, Middlesex.</p> <p><strong>What it sells</strong> Bread, cakes, sweet and savoury pastries, sandwiches, soft drinks and take-away tea and coffee.</p> <p><strong>First impressions</strong> The windows, layered with traditional buns, cakes and pastries presents a storybook ideal of a bakery. The choice of sugared snacks is enormous, from a fridge cabinet of whole gateaux to plain iced fingers and a population of gingerbread men. Traditional loaves are crammed along the back wall along with cholla, scofa, oat and barley bread, sour-dough and numerous other exotica.</p> <p><strong>What were the staff like</strong> Four were on duty, all of who were young, cheerful women who served me promptly and with a smile.</p> <p><strong>Best bargain </strong>Three sweet pastry hearts for \u00a31.</p> <p><strong>What does it charge?</strong> Large white sandwich loaf, \u00a31.51; large wholemeal loaf, \u00a31.75; Belgian iced bun, 88p; jam doughnut, 50p; sausage roll, 99p.</p> <p><strong>Where can I pay?</strong> Two tills behind the main counter. The shop was empty when I visited.</p> <p><strong>Is loyalty rewarded?</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>Lasting impressions</strong> It's rare to find a bakery with such a huge choice of buns and pastries, including many old favourites such as jam tarts and egg custards that can be hard to find in trendier rivals. The range of breads make up for the adventurousness lacking in the sweetmeats. The sandwiches are a pretty basic array of cheese, ham, egg or tuna; lunch is better served by the savoury pastry counter.</p> <p>Greggs, by far the larger chain with a presence on the stock market, is considerably cheaper and its bread had a better crust, but on this occassion the lack of choice and sombre staff made it a less appealing experience than Percy Ingle.</p> <p><strong>Overall rating</strong> 8/10.</p> <h2>Last time</h2> <p>Co-op was a clear winner when it took on Spar, claiming 82% of the votes cast.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17363134\" title=\"Store Wars quote\">watsonbotson</a> gave a detailed account of why Co-op was their favourite:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The Co-op has a good layout, is clean, tidy, with a relatively attractive interior for a convenience store. Of course, like any 'c-store', the pricing is not brilliant but they do have a lot of own brand products that are reasonable. Spar, on the other hand, is a nightmare. The prices are crazy, \u00a33 for a tomato pasta sauce in a student area?\" </p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17381968\" title=\"Store Wars quote\">KeithClan</a> agreed:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Both are good at what they do, but the Co-op scores on it's on premises bakery and the price of its Czech beer (although that's risen 30% in the past 18 months). Also the Co-op has a much better wine section with good offers. And the Divi voucher for loyalty is quite generous. So sorry Spar, C-op guys win.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>However, there were some concerns about the retailer's stance on welfare standards. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17378709\" title=\"Store Wars comment\">jonathancrewdson</a> said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The Co-op Group's general stance is that it doesn't have a problem with halal or kosher, and that includes the investment and lending activities of its bank. Most people that are concerned about animal welfare, including myself, object to that. Mind you, years after the Co-op Bank had adopted its so-called \"ethical\" policy the Co-op Food Outlets were still selling their own brand battery hen eggs along with other unethical products. Its inconsistencies like that which have made me believe they are not really serious about the whole ethical thing.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And it's use of muzak. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17382906\" title=\"Store Wars quote\">Jokken</a> was particularly miffed by this:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Co-op loses out completely, and I have torn up my membership card because of the loud, soul-destroying music that they force on customers. They have been voted by one organisation as the worst chain in the country for that. I wouldn't shop there on a bet\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Let us know which of today's retailers you favour, or if you aren't a fan of either or think another offers better choice or prices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.easypolls.net/ext/scripts/emPoll.js?p=502e1628e4b02c3adb09aa2b\"> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://www.easypolls.net/ext/scripts/emPoll.js?p=502e1628e4b02c3adb09aa2b\"></script><a class=\"OPP-powered-by\" href=\"https://www.murvey.com\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><div style=\"font: 9px arial; color: gray;\">online surveys</div></a> </figure>  <p></p>",

  "<p>What motivated you to start your own business? Was it the attraction of going it alone, with no boss to call the shots? Or was the trigger a gaping hole in the market you spotted before anyone else? Perhaps it was an itch you had to scratch, to know whether your spark of inspiration could be turned into a successful enterprise.</p> <p>Recent research by IT specialist Sage discovered <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/sme/small-talk-entrepreneurial-spirit-alive-and-kicking-in-north-8009158.html\">that one in four people</a> would like to start their own business. Interestingly, the research also found it's the north of England, not the south-east, that appears to be nurturing entrepreneurial spirit. Yorkshire and the north-east had the highest percentage of budding entrepreneurs, according to the research.</p> <p>But anyway, we digress. The study identified a number of reasons why people in these areas want to go it alone.</p> <p>Prospective startups in the north-east are driven by the desire to do something they are passionate about full-time, the stats show. In Yorkshire, the greater control that being your own boss offers is seen as a powerful motivator for a quarter of all potential startups. In both areas the desire to make more money also ranked highly as the reason behind would-be business owners' ambitions.</p> <p>So that's them. What about you? Tell us about your decision to start your own business - what tipped the balance for you? Has it always been a lifelong dream of yours?

In the search for an answer, I did not expect a repressive and inquisition-like reaction.\"</p> <p>Their lawyers called the court hearings worse than a Soviet-era show trial, although the consequences are likely to be less grave.</p> <p>In a move widely seen as a signal to the court, Vladimir Putin said last week he thought the women should not be judged \"too severely\".</p> <p>Pussy Riot formed as an anonymous feminist punk collective in October 2010, in the weeks after Putin's declaration that he would return to the presidency after four years as prime minister. He had stepped down because the constitution did not allow more than two consecutive terms as president. His formal return, although expected, sent a wave of anger through segments of Russian society. Some began to refer to him as Tsar; others used the word \"authoritarian\".</p> <p>The women of Pussy Riot, students and graduates of some of Moscow's most prestigious schools, were among that number.</p> <p>\"A lot of us couldn't sleep after this announcement,\" a member of the band, who identified herself as Tyurya, told the Guardian during a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/02/pussy-riot-protest-russia\" title=\"\">rare interview</a> early this year. \"We felt such anger because of this rudeness, this arrogance towards citizens. So we decided, damn it, we need to do something.\"</p> <p>They looked at their influences \u2013 the Riot grrrl movement, punk rock, feminist thinkers such as Judith Butler and philosophers including Michel Foucault \u2013 and the form of protest became clear. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, along with her husband, Pyotr Verzilov, was a longtime member of Voina, a radical art collective that shot to global notoriety after holding a protest orgy in a Moscow museum and painting a massive phallus on a drawbridge across from the headquarters of the FSB security services in St Petersburg.</p> <p>\"Art is politics,\" said Tolokonnikova when asked in January if Pussy Riot considered themselves protesters or artists. \"We couldn't imagine ourselves without one or the other. We don't understand how an artist can think about society but say he's apolitical.\"</p> <p>They began gathering at the flat Yekaterina Samutsevich shared with her 73-year-old father, Stanislav, who attended every court hearing and was called to testify for the prosecution during the case against he daughter, whom he affectionately calls Katya. \"At the end of last year, the girls began to gather at our home \u2013 they put some dresses together, drew something, talked,\" he told the court. \"Katya didn't tell me what they were up to. I had no idea what it would lead to.\"</p> <p>What it led to was the most radical form of protest Russia has seen since demonstrators began taking to the streets in December to decry Putin's leadership. Pussy Riot carried out lightning punk performances around Moscow, shouting and stomping often until they were dragged away by police. Raw guitar was added to video clips later, creating a multimedia message that spread across the internet. Most shocking was their look \u2013 brightly coloured dresses and stockings accompanied by menacing balaclavas to ensure anonymity.</p> <p>\"Our anonymity and visual look aren't common for female bands,\" Tyurya told the Guardian. \"Even though we wear dresses, we make \"unfeminine\" movements. It's a multilevel way of breaking with traditional feminine behaviour.\"</p> <p>They began by performing in the metro, still considered a strategic site under Russian law, and were once detained but quickly released.</p> <p>Then came performances on posh Moscow streets and the roofs of city buses. When opposition leader <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2012/jan/15/alexei-navalny-profile-vladimir-putin\" title=\"\">Alexei Navalny</a> was arrested at Russia's first big protest on 5 December and sentenced to 15 days in jail, they performed outside his cell. Their notoriety was sealed in January when eight members of the band took to a platform on Red Square calling for \"revolt in Russia\" and that \"Putin has pissed himself\" with fear.</p> <p>On 21 February four members of the band walked into the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, a gaudy building built after the Soviet collapse that hosts Russia's senior officials on major holidays. They thought they were highlighting the church's increasingly close relationship with the state and what they saw as campaigning for Putin by Patriarch Kirill, its leader.</p> <p>\"Our goal was to bring attention to Father Kirill's public statements that the Orthodox must vote for Putin,\" Alyokhina told the court.</p> <p>Video of the stunt went viral and launched a passionate discussion about the church's collaboration with Putin. State-run media decried the performance. Two weeks later, the women were arrested.</p> <p>\"I thought the church loved its children,\" Alyokhina's statement read. \"It turns out the church only loves those children who believe in Putin.\"</p> <p>All eyes were on the trial as the prosecution and its witnesses argued that the women were doing the devil's work, that their bright clothes were an insult to prayer, that they were motivated by a deep hatred of all Orthodox Christians rather than by anger at the Putin regime. Church representatives argued the trial was the work of God.</p> <p>Repeatedly denied the right to call witnesses, to make objections and, sometimes, even to speak, the defence also through protocol out the window and resorted to shouts and insults. It descended into a kangaroo court.</p> <p>Meanwhile the attention of global artists began to build, from Franz Ferdinand to Stephen Fry to Madonna. Pussy Riot chapters were launched throughout the world, imitation performances, balaclavas and all, carried out everywhere from Paris to Helsinki. All this for a band that has yet to release an album.</p> <p>\"For all the radicalism of their actions, Pussy Riot are basically a pop crossover,\" said Michael Idov, the editor of Russian GQ. \"They are a brilliant brand \u2013 they have a very compelling story and easily reproducible look and, let's face it, a great band name.\"</p>",

Leonardo's apparently scientifically rigorous study of the womb contains a bizarre mistake: it is modelled on a cow's womb. This is not just because at the time he made this drawing Leonardo had no access to human dissection; it is also because he believed so strongly that human anatomy must be similar to that of other animals. He recognised, like a true scientist, that we too are animals \u2013 an outrageous notion in the early 1500s. Leonardo did get to do a series of brilliant dissections of people who had died at a hospital in Florence.

  "<p>Many aspiring homeowners feel like they have to \"win the lottery\" to buy a house, as the price of the average property in England has soared by more than three times the rate of average salaries over a decade, according to <a href=\"http://www.housing.org.uk/media/news/house_prices_rise_three_times.aspx\" title=\"House prices rise three times as much as incomes over ten years\">a report</a>.</p> <p>In 2001 the average price of a home in England was \u00a3121,769, and the average salary was \u00a316,557. In 2011 the price of the average home was \u00a3236,518 \u2013 an increase of 94% \u2013 while wages had risen by just 29% to \u00a321,330, the National Housing Federation said.</p> <p>The disparity is even greater in some areas. People living in Copeland in the Lake District, where according to the local borough council about 50% of the working population is employed by the Sellafield nuclear power plant or reliant on it for related employment, have seen the biggest increase in the gap between average house prices and wages: house prices have risen by 145% and incomes by just 5% over the past 10 years.</p> <p>In Watford the average house price is up 76% to \u00a3246,455, while the average salary has fallen by 13% to \u00a315,272, and in Corby in Northamptonshire the gap has also widened markedly. There, the average house price has more than doubled from \u00a360,594 to \u00a3132,381, while a local salary has increased only marginally from about \u00a317,000 to \u00a318,522.</p> <p>Across the country, those who earn enough to buy a house will have to put down a far bigger percentage of the property price than they did in 2001.</p> <p>In 2001 the deposit for a typical 90% mortgage was \u00a312,177, about nine months' salary, according to the NHF, which has compiled its data from Land Registry and ONS figures. Now, because banks and building societies have tightened their lending criteria, a buyer can typically expect to put down a 25% deposit at \u00a359,129, almost three years salary. For someone in Copeland, this means they would now typically have to find a deposit of more than \u00a332,000 compared to the \u00a35,000 they could have put down in 2001.</p> <p>David Orr, chief executive of the NHF, said: \"With the gap between income and house prices growing ever wider, people can often feel like they have to win the lottery to be able to buy in their local area.</p> <p>\"A shortage of homes means the price to buy them is being pushed ever higher by the market, and out of reach of millions of hard working families. Unless we start building more homes people can truly afford to match the demand, this will only get worse.\"</p> <p>Last Thursday, figures released by the government showed that the number of new house builds started in the three months between April and June this year was at a three-year low.</p> <p>Commenting on the NHF report, housing minister Grant Shapps said: \"We are pulling out all the stops to help people across the country realise their dream of homeownership. We've introduced the NewBuy Guarantee, enabling aspiring homeowners to buy with just a fraction of the deposit they would normally require; the FirstBuy scheme, offering a valuable alternative to the bank of mum and dad; and Funding for Lending, to make mortgages cheaper and easier to get.\"</p> <p>The problem of saving for a deposit while renting was highlighted by a separate report from LSL property services, which owns estate agency chains such as Your Move and Reeds Rains, showing that rents in England and Wales reached a record high in July.</p> <p>Tenants are now paying an average of \u00a3725 a month, 2.9% more than in July 2011.</p> <p>In response to LSL's research, the head of Britain's biggest housing charity, Shelter, said \"out of control\" rents were having a devastating impact on ordinary families who are having to cut back on food and other essentials.</p>",
  "<p>The Moors murderer Ian Brady has seldom been far from the headlines since he was convicted of luring five children to their death with his then partner Myra Hindley 46 years ago.</p> <p>In November 1985, he was transferred from a prison to the high-security Ashworth hospital in Maghull, Merseyside, after he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act following his diagnosis as a psychopath. Since then, he has challenged the authorities with a long-running campaign to be allowed to starve himself to death, but has so far been unsuccessful.</p> <p>He began a hunger strike in 1999 and has been force-fed, against his will, every day, via a tube.</p> <p>Brady has a reputation as a prolific letter writer. In recent years, the 74-year-old has suffered from ill-health. A heavy smoker, until smoking was banned at the high-security hospital, he suffers from the debilitating spine condition spondylitis, which is degenerative.</p> <p>As he is sectioned under the Mental Health Act, he is not allowed to take his own life. Last month, he was due to attend a public mental health tribunal hearing about his legal move to be declared sane and transferred to a Scottish prison, where he could potentially starve himself to death. But he had a seizure while speaking to his solicitor at the high-security hospital, and was taken amid tight security to an NHS hospital for treatment.</p> <p>Had he appeared at the tribunal, it would have been the first time Brady would have been seen in public since 1966.</p> <p>Judge Robert Atherton, who had been due to preside over the tribunal, said it had received information about Brady's health that made a delay necessary. It has been adjourned to an unspecified date.</p> <p>He has publicly stated he would never apply for parole, but has repeatedly campaigned for voluntary euthanasia for UK patients in special hospitals.</p> <p>Brady has never expressed any remorse for his crimes or empathy for his victims and psychiatrists have concluded he has an overwhelming need for control, played out repeatedly during the course of his life \u2013 evident in his constant refusal to reveal the location of Keith Bennett's remains.</p> <p>But his attempts to force the authorities to allow him to starve himself to death have failed. In March 2000, a judge described his hunger strike as part of his \"obsessive need to exercise control\". The ruling said he lacked the ability to make rational decisions involving food.</p> <p>Brady and Myra Hindley were convicted at Chester assizes of murdering five children, whose bodies were concealed on Saddleworth moor in Greater Manchester.</p> <p>The victims of the Moors murderers were Pauline Reade, 16, who disappeared on her way to a party on 12 July 1963; John Kilbride, 12, snatched in November the same year; Keith Bennett, snatched on 16 June 1964, after he left home to visit his grandmother; Lesley Ann Downey, 10, who was lured away from a funfair on Boxing Day 1964; and Edward Evans, 17, who was killed in October 1965.</p> <p>In 1987, Hindley and Brady were taken back to the moors in an attempt to find the remains of Keith Bennett and Pauline Reade, but only Pauline's remains were discovered. Hindley died in prison in November 2002, aged 60.</p> <p>Four years ago, in an eight-page letter to his MP and solicitor, which was made public, Brady complained about low wages and poor treatment at Ashworth hospital.</p> <p>He criticised the then government, accusing it of undermining civil liberties by playing on people's security fears. Brady bemoaned that he only received a \u00a325-a-week allowance, while others at the hospital got \u00a3100.</p>",
  "<p>\"There is a consequence\" is the forbidding slogan of a US website called <a href=\"http://www.lousytippers.com/\">Lousy Tippers</a>, which I discovered via <a href=\"http://eater.com/archives/2012/08/09/lousy-tippers-database-shames-the-stingy.php\">this piece on Eater.com</a>. It's a forum for food delivery guys, waiters and the similarly employed to upload stories of bad tippers, shame them by listing their names and addresses and to append vengeful comments. These can get pretty furious. Of an address in New Hampshire, one user writes: \"The guy here tips fine, the woman tips like shit. Maybe you'll get a warm 2l Coke next time.\" Elsewhere: \"What kind of cheap ass leaves less than 10% tip? Go die.\" An Ohio man who left a $2 tip on a $30 bill finds himself succinctly glossed as a \"fucking nightmare\".</p> <p>Publishing people's real addresses is wrong, of course, and the occasional flare-ups of racism on the site are thoroughly depressing. But I confess to feeling a good deal of sympathy for the principles behind Lousy Tippers. A waiter or deliveryman in the US likely earns under $3 an hour \u2013 they're heavily reliant on tips to secure a living wage. Absent a forum like this, he or she has no recourse to complain about bad customers or to reinforce the need for others to tip properly. The carrot of doing a job well has failed: it's time for the stick.<br><br>Undertipping is less of a problem in the UK, where most restaurants whack 12.5% on to every bill regardless and where there is, in general, less of a tipping culture. (If you've ever felt that service wasn't very good in New York, don't take it, as they say, personal \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k2186116-Are_the_British_bad_tippers-New_York_City_New_York.html\">Brits are notorious there</a> for being polite customers but <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2008/jul/25/ohnobritishpeople\">terrible tippers</a>, and some waiters don't try as hard at a table of British accents.) Nonetheless, there are British punters who routinely exercise their option to deduct optional service, even when nothing was wrong with the meal. They should be discouraged from doing so.</p> <p>Gossip websites love to describe celebrities who fail to tip: <a href=\"http://www.glamorati.com/celebrity/2008/34-notoriously-bad-celebrity-tippers/\">Sean Penn reportedly failed</a> to leave a cent after one $450 bill; John Kerry, it's claimed, once left a $20 tip on a $700 check. The actor <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Piven\">Jeremy Piven</a> is <a href=\"http://www.thefrisky.com/photos/celebrities-who-do-not-tip-well/btpiven-063009-g4-jpg/\">supposedly banned from Nobu restaurants</a> after he almost unbelievably left a DVD of the TV show Entourage, in which he has a major role, instead of a tip.</p> <p>Moreover, Lousy Tippers isn't the only place that waiters can complain about customers who undertip. The <a href=\"http://15percent.tumblr.com\">15percent blog</a> is full of <a href=\"http://15percent.tumblr.com/post/5338473557\">smudgy photographs</a> of <a href=\"http://15percent.tumblr.com/post/5459341743\">cheap tips</a>. It also features helpful <a href=\"http://15percent.tumblr.com/post/5414974064\">thoughts on tipping</a> from staff themselves, explaining things from a waiter's point of view.</p> <p>And that's surely the point. Eating out is a contract between staff and punter, and the latter should willingly pay a fair price if the food and service have been good. The customer will be the first to kvetch on Yelp or TripAdvisor if they feel their waiter has underperformed: though Lousy Tippers takes the reverse too far, it shows there is indeed a consequence.</p>",

He said Assange would be arrested if he leaves the embassy in London where he has lived for nearly two months.</p> <p>Ecuador's decision has also angered the Swedish authorities, who wish to question Assange and the two women who claim he assaulted them during a trip to the country in 2010. Assange denies the assault claims and says he fears being sent on to the United States where he could face political persecution for releasing thousands of secret US cables.</p> <p>The standoff will escalate tensions between the two countries over the fate of Assange, who has skipped bail while awaiting removal from the UK. It follows allegations from Ecuador that the British government has threatened to storm the embassy to seize Assange. Diplomatic posts are often considered the territory of the foreign nation.</p> <p>After a day of dramatic developments and protests, Assange watched the asylum decision from a room in the embassy in Knightsbridge, central London, via a live link to a press conference from the Ecuadorean capital, Quito.</p> <p>Hague responded by saying Assange would not be allowed safe passage out of the UK, and that it was a \"matter of regret\" that the Ecuadorean government decided to grant the WikiLeaks founder political asylum. But Hague said that did not change the fundamentals of the case.</p> <p>Speaking at the Foreign Office, he added the case could go on for a considerable time. \"We will not allow Mr Assange safe passage out of the United Kingdom, nor is there any legal basis for us to do so.\"</p> <p>On Wednesday, British government officials sent a letter to Ecuadorean officials in Quito outlining the powers of the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987, which allows revocation of a building's diplomatic status if the foreign power occupying it \"ceases to use land for the purposes of its mission or exclusively for the purposes of a consular post\".</p> <p>Hague dismissed Ecuadorean claims that the letter was a threat to \"attack\" their embassy.</p> <p>\"There is no threat here to storm an embassy. We are talking about an act of parliament in this country which stresses that it must be used in full conformity with international law,\" he said. Officials said use of the act has not been ruled out.</p> <p>Hague also denied claims by Assange and his supporters that there was a deal that would see him extradited to the US.</p> <p>The country's foreign affairs minister, Ricardo Pati\u00f1o, said Assange was clear that he is being persecuted for political reasons because of the disclosure of documents by WikiLeaks. \"Ecuador is sure that there is a real threat of him being extradited to a third country, without any guarantees. He would be subject to cruel treatment,\" Patino said in his press conference in Quito.</p> <p>The Ecuadorean government has conducted lengthy diplomatic talks with the UK, Swedish and US governments, Pati\u00f1o said.</p> <p>He said that the UK's reaction amounted to a strong threat: \"It is basically saying, 'We are going to beat you savagely if you don't behave \u2026 but if you behave, we may not beat you savagely.\"</p> <p>An official said Ecuador had acted within international and diplomatic law ever since Assange took refuge inside the building.</p> <p>The Swedish foreign ministry said it had summoned Ecuador's ambassador over the Latin American country's \"unacceptable\" decision to grant asylum.</p> <p>Assange will give a statement outside the embassy on Sunday afternoon, according to tweets posted on the WikiLeaks Twitter feed, prompting speculation that he could be arrested because the property might be outside the embassy.</p> <p>The lawyer of two Swedish women who made allegations of sexual assault against Assange denounced Ecuador's move as \"absurd\". Claes Borgstrom told reporters that the move was an abuse of the asylum instrument, the purpose of which is to protect people from persecution and torture if sent back to one's country of origin. \"He doesn't risk being handed over to the United States for torture or the death penalty. He should be brought to justice in Sweden,\" she said.</p> <p>The Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) has convened an \"extraordinary meeting\" in Ecuador on Sunday to discuss the situation at the embassy.</p> <p>A statement released on the website of the foreign ministry of Peru, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the intergovernmental union, said: \"The Foreign Ministry of Peru lets public opinion know that, in concordance with the statutory responsibilities of the temporary presidency of UNASUR, at the behest of the Republic of Ecuador and after consulting member states, an extraordinary meeting of the Counsel of Foreign Ministers of the Union has been convened on Sunday August 19 in the city of Guayaquil, Ecuador.</p> <p>\"The meeting has been requested with the intention of considering the situation raised at the embassy of Ecuador in the United Kingdom.\"</p>",
  "<p>The aphorism \"cut well, sew well, get well\" is certainly true for heart surgery, where one of the most rewarding things is seeing the huge impact an operation can have in improving a patient's quality of life.</p> <p>I work at Papworth Hospital, Cambridge \u2013 the UK's largest specialist heart and lung centre. I've been there for the past 20 years and it's a great hospital to work at with an international reputation for innovation and cutting-edge research. It's also super specialist and takes on patients with complex conditions that other hospitals may have turned down.</p> <p>My day starts at 5:30 when I have two black coffees while listening to the radio. Recently, I've been using the morning to work on a book I'm currently writing, a sort of guide to help the non-medical person understand what makes good surgery. I think it's crucial that patients are able to interpret surgical outcome data so they can make informed decisions about their course of treatment, and the book aims to explain just that.</p> <p>I'm in the hospital just before 8:00. If it's a nice day, I'll cycle the fifteen miles to work with two of my colleagues but my favourite (and fastest) way of getting to work is on my motorbike. I've had one since I was at medical school and, although I eventually saw sense and bought a car, motorcycling is still my preferred mode of travel.</p> <p>My week is divided into operating and non-operating days. Monday and Tuesday are my designated operating days and I like to come in early and stay late to check the progress of my patients. During the rest of the week I'm in clinics or working in research.</p> <p>On a typical operating day, I will conduct between two and three operations. Recently, I operated on an 82-year-old woman who was having difficulty breathing due to a narrowing of the aortic valve. Some of the more complex operations can take as long as ten or twelve hours. In certain cases, I think about them for days, even weeks, in advance as I work through an operation plan in my head.</p> <p>I've even been known to dream about the operation prior to carrying it out, working through some of the more intricate plumbing work to ensure the heart and brain are looked after during surgery.</p> <p>Last week I had one of these cases which took a lot of thinking through and visualising beforehand. The patient was a young man who, despite feeling well, was found to have a rare congenital heart abnormality through screening. He needed an operation urgently as otherwise his chance of survival was very slim. I visually planned the operation while at the dentist's \u2013 which was certainly an effective way to take my mind off where I was!</p> <p>In the field of cardiac surgery, there has been fantastic progress and over the past decade mortality rates have dropped by more than half. This is in large part down to the culture of outcome reporting, as advocated by the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery, and an improved understanding of risk.</p> <p>Back in 1995, I led a group which developed the EuroSCORE system \u2013 an important safety and monitoring tool which predicts the outcomes of heart surgery by analysing the risk factors presented by individual patients. It also allows surgeons to keep a continuous check on their performance and as a result drives improvements throughout the profession.</p> <p>Although I struggle fully to switch off, as I am always on call for my patients, I find composing cryptic crosswords enjoyable and therapeutic. I compile crosswords for the Guardian under a pseudonym, but I'm not telling you which one!</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-healthcare-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",
  "<p>This year the National Federation of Almos celebrated 10 years since the first arm's length management organisations (Almos) were formed. Back in April 2002, their primary function was to deliver the Decent Homes Standard.</p> <p>Today, there are 55 Almos managing more than 800,000 council homes across England and 500,000 properties have been transformed. The role of these organisations is now be evolving, but their commitment to social housing tenants remains stronger than ever.</p> <p>Their success over the last decade has demonstrated that Almos and their staff have an in-depth knowledge of their tenants and the issues important to them. They work very closely with their local authorities to improve tenants' future prospects and, as a council house tenant myself, I know from first-hand experience this should not be underestimated.</p> <p>From where I sit there are three key areas where Almos have excelled over the last 10 years, which will help determine what their focus should be over the next decade.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Supporting tenants into work </strong></p> <p>Almos have a strong track record in boosting the prospects of tenants and residents of all ages, from disadvantaged youngsters to unemployed adults, and helping them to turn their lives around. A good example of this is Lewisham Homes, which set out with its council and contractors to teach residents transferrable skills, offer apprenticeships and create new employment opportunities. This is the right training and support for communities, and shows how housing can do its bit to address national unemployment levels.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Tenant participation in housing management </strong></p> <p>Andrew Stunell, parliamentary under-secretary for communities and local government, said Almos have achieved a level of tenant participation \"that has completely eluded councils in the past\". The key to that success has been listening to tenants and involving them in the way their housing services are run. With this in mind, the federation has worked with individual Almos to develop a series of new housing models.</p> <p>We would advise Almos who have already completed or are entering the final stages of their Decent Homes work to consider what a new type of arm's length organisation looks like, perhaps following in the footsteps of Barnet Homes which has significantly expanded its adult social care services with the formation of The Barnet Group. Gloucester City Homes, meanwhile, is pursuing the community and council-owned (CoCo) model in order to access new investment and give tenants more control over their housing services.</p> <p>New ALMOs such as Cornwall Housing and East Kent Homes have been created without an emphasis on renovation, but rather because they have deemed the model the best way to manage housing and social tenants within their areas.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Better homes</strong></p> <p>There is an urgent need to comfortably house the five million people sitting on the social housing waiting list \u2013 a statistic which is quite frankly scandalous. Tackling this is only really achievable with a solid commitment to new development, ensuring property sizes reflect the number of people within the household, and by bringing the country's 28,000 council-owned empty homes back into action.</p> <p>As well as delivering improvements, Almos have also proved very successful at new development. Stockport Homes was the first ALMO to build new homes but many others, including as Berneslai Homes, Brent Housing Partnership, Cheltenham Borough Homes and Solihull Community Housing, following quickly in its lead.</p> <p>ALMOs have proved their model works in these three core areas. Those questioning the purpose of Almos post-Decent Homes perhaps overlook these remarkable strengths, and the best practice that has been developed in the arm's length sector. As the old adage goes, \"if it isn't broke... don't fix it\".</p> <p><em>Sue Roberts is chair of the </em><a href=\"http://www.almos.org.uk\" title=\"\"><em>National Federation of Almos</em></a><em> and tenant chair of </em><a href=\"http://www.wolverhamptonhomes.org.uk/DesktopDefault.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>Wolverhampton Homes</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network for comment</strong></a><strong>, analysis and </strong><a href=\"http://housingjobs.theguardian.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>the latest jobs</strong></a><strong> direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>This week the documentary series <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00zdf6q\" title=\"\">Neighbourhood Watched</a> returns to BBC1. The programme, which for this series will follow staff at Manchester's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2012/jun/08/new-charter-housing-trust\">New Charter Housing</a>, aims to shine a light on the lives of housing officers and their tenants. It will tackle everyday issues such as the growing housing waiting list, anti-social behaviour and family breakdown.</p> <p>As the final edits were made to the series, it emerged that many social landlords had been asked to participate but had turned down the opportunity. David Rigby, a communications consultant and adviser to the series, said that his approaches <a href=\"http://www.24dash.com/news/housing/2012-08-15-Landlords-fear-TV-cameras-as-housing-returns-to-prime-time\" title=\"\">had been \"rebuffed\"</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>The reluctance of social landlords to take part interests me. Most are happy to push press releases extolling their successes at a diminishing print media, particularly local newspapers. Many flee at the thought of television, especially without editorial control. Tony Powell, executive director of neighbourhoods at New Charter, told me most of his peers still think he is \"brave\" to invite the cameras in. Yet most people get their news and information from television, the web and radio.</p> </blockquote> <p>The reaction of housing associations to this fantastic opportunity is disappointing, but not surprising. Housing chiefs know that like any other journalist, a television documentary maker will always be looking for the strongest story to present to the viewer.</p> <p>It's inevitable that what might be described as the \"tough stuff\" will come first in the final edit; we'll see argumentative tenants, snarly teens not in education or work, and staff losing patience with one another as problems escalate. The question is, is that a problem?</p> <p>Housing associations that refused the chance to let the cameras in and see their good work are worried that they will be misrepresented. But the bigger risk \u2013 especially in today's difficult economic and political climate \u2013 is that social housing will not be represented at all.</p> <p>Ensconced in the housing world, it's easy to forget that the coalition government's policy of welfare reform is incredibly popular. The belief that the benefits are too costly and too easy to claim is more widespread than many housing staff might like to admit. Any effort to foster a better understanding of the work of social landlords, and the security and stability that a tenancy can provide, helps make a case for its value. It helps to rally public opinion.</p> <p>Bad PR seeks to cover up mistakes, rather than admit to them and show how a lesson has been learned. The decision to opt out of Neighbourhood Watched smacks of classic bad PR; chief executives so fearful that the cameras will uncover an area of poor practice that they overlook the opportunity to present decades of experience in creating strong and resilient communities (they forget the camera loves a tear-jerking good news story as much terrifying bad one). At worst, it also belies a serious lack of confidence in their staff. It's a testament to New Charter that it has the strength to see beyond this.</p> <p>A more realistic concern about this type of documentary is that, by concentrating on the big emotional moments, the series will fail to record the breadth and depth of housing associations' work. It's a fair criticism, but in truth no public platform is interested in this. Just like TV viewers, politicians are most interested in the broad messages that communicate with voters.</p> <p>For those that passed this over, it's not just a missed chance to engage with the public but a lost opportunity to lobby the government when housing's message is struggling to be heard. However you feel about the final presentation of the series, it's positive to see housing hitting the prime time.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and best practice direct to you</strong></p>",

  "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>Driving up from Boston, Massachusetts to Montreal in Canada to visit family, we stopped for an ice-cream break in Montpelier, Vermont. Montpelier is unique in that it is the only state capital without a McDonald's. Let's not get too excited; with one main street and a population of under 8,000 there's quite a lot it doesn't have.</p> <p>What it does have is the state capitol building, <a href=\"http://www.vtstatehouse.org/\">Vermont State House</a>, with its impressive gold leaf dome backdropped by the wooded hills of <a href=\"http://www.montpelier-vt.org/group/246.html\">Hubbard Park</a>. Drawing the eye to the building is a rather fine border of salvias and pennisetum. I know it's deeply uncool but I do like these extravagant bedding displays, especially in public parks.</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394807445\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2012/8/16/1345132779632/Tom-Hoblyns-North-America-008.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hoblyn's North American gardens\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hoblyn's North American gardens.

The growing season is pretty tight up here (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardiness_zone#USDA_Hardiness_Zones\">hardiness zone four</a>) so I figured the planting palette would be minimal, but I was wrong: between lounging in the pool (it's a muggy 40C) and retreating to the icy air conditioning, I found time to take peek at a neighbour's garden. It had the most diverse display of phlox paniculata, baptisia australis, echinacea 'Art's Pride', in filled with miscanthus sinensis (possibly sarabande). Any gaps were plugged with pompom dahlias and a backbone of shrubs such as hydrangea paniculata and clethra alnifolia. The prairie-like palette feels so appropriate in the setting of a colonial-style house in Quebec. </p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>We had lunch with a maple syrup farmer friend south of Montreal where, many years ago, I spent my gap year. Back then we had to collect the sap from prone-to-spill-and-soak buckets hanging from the trees, often wading through thigh-deep snow. Coming up to full moon, the buckets would often need emptying twice in 24 hours.</p> <p>Now the bush is a massed network of blue pipes with strategically placed pumps. The trees look like particularly generous blood donors with their taps leading to yards of tubing and on to vast storage vats. It takes 200 litres of sap to make one litre of syrup. Growing wild on the fringes of the bush (maple woods, acer saccharum) I find my favourite ever perennial, verbena hastata, but in a deep violet blue form. </p> <h2>Thursday and Friday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394807446\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2012/8/16/1345132852537/Tom-Hoblyns-North-America-008.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hoblyn's North American gardens\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hoblyn's North American gardens.

The village sits on the equally picturesque <a href=\"http://magogquebec.homestead.com/files/home_english.htm\">Lake Memphremagog</a>: 36 miles long, one mile wide and 396ft at its deepest. Most of the time is spent swimming in the lake (it has dropped to 34C) and eating freshly picked <em>mais sucre</em> (sweetcorn). </p> <p>The trip down to the lake takes us past a very \"designed\" garden. Again, lots of prairie plants: helianthemum, phlox, echinacea and a fantastic hydrangea paniculata surrounding the colonial-style house. All very setting-appropriate but totally wrongfooted by an expensive-looking water rill plonked in the middle, with perfect sheets of water cascading over the steel-edged side. Very odd indeed and not up to tea-towel standard.</p> <h2>Saturday</h2> <p>The drive back down to Boston takes us through the scenic <a href=\"http://www.visitwhitemountains.com/\">White Mountains</a>.

Boston is an amazing place with lots of history (much of it anti-British, what with the Tea Party, revolution and all that). While the family have a rest in the <a href=\"http://www.cityofboston.gov/parks/emerald/public_garden.asp\">public garden</a> (it's back up to 40C with a whopping thunderstorm on the way), I inspect the sumptuous bedding displays. </p> <p>The find of the week \u2013 possibly the entire summer - was hibiscus moscheutos. I suspect it to be the appropriately named 'Disco Belle' \u2013 a definite must-have in my garden for next year. A whole bed of them blossomed under the watchful eye of George Washington.</p> <h2>Monday</h2> <p>Our flight was cancelled and we spent an extra day in Boston.

  "<h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhvtUUe_U4c\">1) Vladimir Smicer (Liverpool 3-3 Milan, 2005)</a></h2> <p>English clubs have won European football\u2019s top prize four times during the Champions League era, and on each occasion the victors have benefitted from immense slices of luck in the final. We could spend some time detailing how the bread repeatedly fell jam side up for Manchester United in 1999 and Chelsea in 2012, but it\u2019s probably enough to say that both sides found themselves playing the perennially hapless Bayern Munich, who used up all their European Cup final fortune against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Leeds United in the 1970s and have been paying back the karmic debt ever since.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/aug/23/the-joy-of-six-flukes\">The Joy of Six: sporting flukes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>United won again in 2008, or more accurately did their level best to lose it until John Terry redefined hubris and gifted it to them before skittering all around Moscow on his sorry, soggy arse. But it\u2019s Liverpool\u2019s 2005 vintage who, of these four separate sides, cop the most flak for outrageous fortune. Unfairly in some respects: while they couldn\u2019t hold a candle to either of the United sides, they were palpably no worse than this year\u2019s European champions. Then again, you can\u2019t be going three goals down in European finals and expect the wider footballing world to take you particularly seriously. It\u2019s just the way things work. A small price to pay, and it\u2019s doubtful Liverpool fans gave too many flying ones when their team was bouncing around with the cup. (See also Chelsea earlier this year, etc and so on.)</p> <p>However, it should be recorded that their famous Istanbul comeback was kept on course by the raging winds of a perfect storm. There\u2019s a fair chance that Steven Gerrard\u2019s superlative header on 54 minutes would have stood as nothing more than a consolation had Milan managed to subsequently resist Liverpool for more than the two minutes they managed. But it wasn\u2019t to be, and in the space of a few crazy seconds, all the pieces slotted into place for the Reds. Milan Baros was caught offside, and flagged accordingly, but the referee waved play on, to no discernible advantage to the <em>Rossoneri</em>. Rino Gattuso immediately gifted Djimi Traor\u00e9 possession, from which Liverpool won a throw down the left \u2013 just as Kak\u00e1\u2019s shinpad slipped out. The Brazilian bent down to readjust his stockings, allowing Xabi Alonso, on his shoulder, time and room to slip the ball inside to Didi Hamann, who shuttled the ball further right to Vladimir Smicer: 3-2. A likely consolation had suddenly become the catalyst of an unstoppable comeback, the most jaw-dropping in big-match history, and all because of one man\u2019s loose sock. <strong>SM</strong></p> <h2>2) Ivan Robinson (Barrow 1-0 Plymouth Argle, 1968)</h2> <p>Barrow were on a roll going into this match, the greatest roll in their history. They were unbeaten in 17 home matches and sat in fourth place, a point off the top of Division Three. Plymouth, whom Billy Bingham was attempting to guide back to Division Two at the first attempt, were eighth. The match turned out to be a stinker. Fittingly, it was decided by rotten luck.</p> <p>With 77 minutes gone and 5,541 fans struggling to stay awake, the home team won a corner. Plymouth nodded it out to the edge of the area, where the striker George McClean met it with a powerful but misdirected shot: rather than head towards the goal, it whizzed towards the referee Ivan Robinson. The official tried to jump out of the way but was not fast enough and the ball ricocheted off him and past the wrongfooted Plymouth goalkeeper. The referee\u2019s reflexes may have been shoddy but his knowledge of the laws of the game was sound and despite the Plymouth protests, he awarded a goal. Barrow held on for a victory that sent them to second in Division Three, their highest ever league standing. But then Barrow\u2019s wheels came off: the fluke seemed to carry a curse.</p> <p>They failed to win any of their next 15 league matches and in January 1969 their inspirational manager, Colin Appleton, had to retire due to ill health. The club finished 19th in the league. The following season they were relegated back to Division Four, and the season after that they finished bottom of the bottom division. But that was not rock bottom. Because the season after that they finished 22nd out of 24 teams in Division Four (ahead of Stockport County and Crewe Alexandra) \u2026 but were still voted out of the league. Elected in their place were Hereford United, who despite only finishing second in the Southern League (behind Chelmsford City) had captured public imagination by beating Newcastle United in the FA Cup, whereas Barrow were deeply unloved by dint of their geographical remoteness, the speedway track they put around their pitch, and being all out of luck. <strong>PD</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://youtu.be/Fkj5ffbA7DM?t=5s\">3) Tomas Brolin (Sheffield Wednesday 6-2 Leeds United 1995)</a></h2> <p>We almost plumped for a similarly comical goal conceded by Sheffield Wednesday <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CfH2TVulyA#t=6m40s\">a few years earlier</a> in this slot, but since the Manchester United forward Brian McClair actually stopped and stroked the ball into the net after it had finished rebounding off everything and everyone, it just didn\u2019t seem fair to ignore Brolin\u2019s first goal for Leeds United, which came in the whacking great 6-2 defeat by Wednesday for which the United manager Howard Wilkinson has only just stopped apologising. It bounces in off his face while he\u2019s making like a landed fish in the penalty box, for chrissake!</p> <p>This was about a month before Brolin wiped his cheeks with his Leeds contract by deliberately being \u201cpiss-poor\u201d (his words) against Liverpool after being asked to play out of position for the umpteenth time. Upon signing for Leeds, he\u2019d been promised a role conducting things with a wave of his foot from the centre circle, but by the time he made his last start for the club, a few months after signing, he was being played out on the right. Injuries, see. That, and the fact that Wilkinson seems to have taken against Brolin\u2019s moodiness and decided to keep hammering that square peg into a round hole until all the corners came off or he got bored, whichever came first. Against Wednesday, Brolin lined up as a striker alongside Tony Yeboah \u2013 in the aftermath the Daily Mail even mused that the two might yet become a \u201cfruitful partnership\u201d.</p> <p>The signs were not good, though. Leeds were already three down by the time Brolin\u2019s noggin intervened, and though the Independent reported that Leeds \u201cactually held sway for large chunks of the contest\u201d, the quality of their attacking play was inversely proportional to Wednesday\u2019s (with Chris Waddle brilliant in almost precisely the role Brolin wanted at Leeds). Wilkinson\u2019s decision to play his full-backs as wingers in an effort to supply Yeboah went down as a bad one, but it was a cross from Gary Kelly, who had been trotting down the right, that set up the chance. Brolin put his head to it and chased the dropping ball towards goal, sticking out a boot that pinged the ball off the goalkeeper Kevin Pressman, back in to his own standing leg and across the six-yard box to Steve Nicol, whose attempted clearance hits a by now fallen Brolin in the mush and bounces over the line. The Swede always said he was miserable at Leeds, but he wheeled away celebrating exactly as he did after scoring <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzV4KNj51Do\">that stunner against England</a> in 1992. <strong>GT</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0iL0OPKO9c\">4) Scott Nisbet (Rangers 2-1 Bruges 1993)</a></h2> <p>For all the bother Rangers managed to get themselves into while chasing the dream back there, they didn\u2019t really get much bang for their buck. A few domestic titles, maybe, but then those would probably have been coming anyway. Success in the European Cup was the ultimate goal, and that never really came about. Only two campaigns stick in the mind: 1999-2000, when in the first group stage Walter Smith\u2019s side were genuinely unfortunate to draw both of the eventual finalists in Bayern Munich and Valencia, yet nearly made it through all the same; and 1992-93, when they were pipped to the final by Marseille, but had a hell of a ride along the way.</p> <p>The most memorable and eventful match of that latter run \u2013 given that Leeds United were slapped down with such economy of effort that the tie should be seen retrospectively as a laughable nonevent \u2013 was the group match at Ibrox against Bruges, finalists in the competition 15 years earlier. A winner-takes-all dogfight for the right to keep a hold of Marseille\u2019s coattails, the match wasn\u2019t much of an advertisement for European football, little more than 90 minutes of clanking nonsense. Yet Rangers deserved to win it, if only because Mark Hateley had been ludicrously sent off for a minor handbag infringement, while Ally McCoist was sent flying in the area for no reward. Rangers secured their victory, but only just, and as a result of the silliest goal in the History of All Football.</p> <p>Scott Nisbet\u2019s stupendously daft blooter was hammered straight into the ground down the inside-right channel into St\u00e9phane Van Der Heyden\u2019s feet, flew off on an absurd diagonal dipping arc towards the far post, then pitched on the rutted turf in front of the goalkeeper Dany Verlinden and took a Murali-esque off-break up and over the hapless netminder and into the unguarded net. If that outrage wasn\u2019t enough, Nisbet had only been afforded the opportunity to clank his peg on the ball because Trevor Steven\u2019s aimless cross had ricocheted into his direction off Stuart McCall\u2019s back. \u201cRangers are likely to reach the European Cup final,\u201d said the Bruges manager Hugo Broos after the game, but they had used up all their luck in one outrageous moment. Elsewhere, Marseille were beating CSKA Moscow 6-0 to take a stranglehold on the group they would not relinquish. <strong>SM</strong></p> <h2>5) An extended farce (Sunderland 1-3 Charlton 2003)</h2> <p>There\u2019s a thin line between noble defiance and pure foolishness. Never knowing when you\u2019re beaten is great, except when you are actually beaten. The Polish side Wisla Plock, for example, should have known they were relegated when Adam Czerkas of Odra Wodzislaw Slaski <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Pjxb0dj8j8&amp;feature=fvwrel\">scored this goal</a> against them to inflict a 1-0 defeat in April 2007: there were still six matches left in the season but that was a sure sign the Plockers\u2019 goose was plucked and they ultimately went down by two points. And, of course, Sunderland would have saved their fans a lot of useless hope if they had just announced they were relegated in February 2003 rather than go through the motions of sacking the manager Howard Wilkinson and giving Mick McCarthy not so much a hospital pass as a cemetery cross.</p> <p>That Sunderland were doomed was obvious from the fine blend of fluke and incompetence that was their home defeat to Charlton, during which Sunderland, who had not scored three goals in a league match all season, contrived to hit a trio of own goals. Stephen Wright got the freak show on the road in the 24th minute when a Mark Fish shot rebounded first off Jody Craddock and then off the hapless Wright to drop into the net, and then Michael Proctor took centre stage, diverting the ball into his own net twice in three minutes. Sunderland lost 3-1 and were defeated in another four league matches after that before ousting Wilkinson and suckering in McCarthy to preside over the remaining nine straight defeats. Proctor, possibly, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYJttBJq6lw\">is now playing as a goalkeeper for TSV Grunbach</a>. But luck would eventually turn back in Sunderland\u2019s favour \u2026 <strong>PD</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://youtu.be/K5loeV-_4og\">6) The beach ball (Sunderland 1-0 Liverpool 2009)</a></h2> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hit the balloon \u2013 it\u2019s HIT THE BALLOON, Jeff. It\u2019s a heavy balloon, not one of those light ones, and it\u2019s gone in, IT\u2019S GONE IN! It would have gone to Reina and it\u2019s hit the balloon and gone in! It\u2019s so unlucky, unbelievable.\u201d</p> <p>Thus warbled an excitable Paul Merson, barely keeping his hair in his headphones on Sky Sports News while Jeff Stelling and Phil Thompson guffawed like Mary Poppins\u2019 Uncle Albert. Merson\u2019s \u201cheavy balloon\u201d was actually a beach ball, thrown on to the pitch by a Liverpool supporter and quietly minding its own business in the penalty area when Darren Bent\u2019s shot, straight at Pepe Reina in the Liverpool goal, collided with it and deflected just to Reina\u2019s left. The beach ball itself spun up and to Reina\u2019s right, attracting the bulk of the goalkeeper\u2019s attention and leaving him stood with his hands raised quizzically in the style of Matthew Corbett once again outwitted by Sooty, Sweep and Soo.</p> <p>According to the rules (and the warm breeze emanating from the mouths of Graham Poll and Jeff Winter), the referee ought to have disallowed the goal and awarded a drop ball, but instead he blew his whistle to signal that Sunderland had taken a lead they would not give up. The decision stood even after consultation with the assistant on the line. \u201cI thought the referee and the linesman had got together over an offside decision,\u201d said Sunderland\u2019s manager Steve Bruce, apparently keen to demonstrate his ignorance. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know the rule that it should be a bounce-up. If you really know that rule then you are a little bit sad, so I can forgive everybody. I\u2019ve always thought that if a ball hits an object, it\u2019s Sod\u2019s law and you carry on.\u201d</p> <p>The Premier League decided that the match wouldn\u2019t be replayed and the Liverpool manager Rafael Ben\u00edtez steadfastly refused to use it as fuel for a spectacular rant, despite repeated invitations to do so on the day and in the weeks following. \u201cWe had bad luck with the goal but the team was not doing well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to fix that now; the other things you cannot control.\u201d The young fan who lobbed the ball on to the pitch was reported to be devastated, a well-informed neighbour telling the Sun that \u201cthe ref should never have let the goal stand\u201d. Mike Jones was demoted to the Championship the following weekend, getting through Peterborough\u2019s 3-0 win over Scunthorpe without any interference from inflatables. <strong>GT</strong></p>",

  "<p>Can Labour learn to love localism? The question is more pressing than it might seem. Ed Miliband's recent speeches have hymned the importance of devolving power to town halls. His shadow communities secretary Hilary Benn has hinted at a \"new deal\" for England's cities. The localism debate seems likely to form part of the party's policy review and the discussion that follows will raise challenging questions about its statecraft.</p> <p>The Labour movement holds a deep belief in the power of centralised planning to deliver social justice. The problem is that, after a decade of targets, reforms and scars on ministerial backs, it is hard to argue that centrally-driven reform can deliver the goods. Quite apart from the fact that Blair tested the tools of Whitehall control to destruction, the once-glittering prizes of Westminster power are starting to look tarnished.</p> <p>The high centralism of the Labour years improved many areas of public service but came at a high price. Targets warped professional behaviour and got in the way of joining up local services around the needs of troubled families and elderly patients. The machinery of central control became deeply inefficient; it cost one county council \u00a3135m of overhead to deliver \u00a3176m of economic development funding.</p> <p>Perhaps more importantly, the institutions of central control are currently taking a battering from which they may find it hard to recover. After the expenses scandal only 14% of the public trusts national politicians to tell the truth, while just 24% of us approve of the current system of governing Britain. Meanwhile, the debate over independence north of the border is bringing English nationalism back to the fore. A remarkable 59% of us do not trust the UK government to work in England's best long term interests.</p> <p>English parliaments do not do the job \u2013 an anti-political nation is hardly likely to support a new institution for which there is scant historical precedent. But a transformed local government provides the starting point for a response to the West Lothian question. Councils still enjoy high levels of public trust, they are generally acknowledged to be efficient and they bring power closer to the citizen in a more authentic way than any new institution could manage.</p> <p>Over the past year, my organisation has convened a commission of experts from local government and beyond to set out a road map for English localism. Our<a href=\"http://www.nlgn.org.uk/public/2012/the-localist-manifesto/\" title=\"\"> Localist Manifesto</a> sets out three steps to reform.</p> <p>Step one is a devolution bill. This would grant local authorities the power to: commission criminal justice services such as courts, prisons and probation services; administer the benefits systems by breaking up job centre plus; and, take decisions over a big chunk of the skills budget. The bill would also contain a new right to bid, allowing councils to make the case for more devolution from Whitehall.</p> <p>Step two is the creation of new combined authorities for England's cities and shires. These would effectively be the GLA without Boris. They are necessary because many council services need to be run at a larger scale to be efficient and effective; it is hard to imagine skills being commissioned separately by each of the 10 Greater Manchester authorities. Councils also have an increasing role in promoting economic growth through managing investment funds and the planning system. These functions are best exercised across cities and counties.</p> <p>Finally, we argue for compulsory voting in local elections. This is a way to solve the localist's dilemma: councils complain that nobody votes for them because they have no power, but Whitehall refuses to pass down more power because councils are not fully accountable. Compulsory voting would transform the practice of local politics, forcing parties to appeal to a much wider range of voters. Including a 'none of the above' box on the ballot paper would give voters a much more powerful way to register a protest than the current system does.</p> <p>These recommendations are not as radical as they may at first seem. The UK is arguably the second most centralised country in the rich world, so a healthy dose of localism would simply bring us into line with the rest of northern Europe. Nobody accuses Germany of having a weak or unfair system of government, despite its strong local and regional institutions.</p> <p>To embrace our recommendations, Labour has to rediscover its tradition of democratic republicanism \u2013 worrying a little less about equality and a lot more about political citizenship. The point is to give local people control of the levers of power and the capability to pull those levers. Let them have more scope to decide for themselves how they are governed. Most of them will choose social justice, most of the time.</p> <p><em>Simon Parker is director of the </em><a href=\"http://www.nlgn.org.uk/public/\" title=\"\"><em>New Local Government Network</em></a><em> thinktank</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and </strong><a href=\"http://localgovernmentjobs.theguardian.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>the latest jobs</strong></a><strong> direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>Tensions ran high in the court case between Apple and Samsung in San Jose on Thursday as the case neared its close, with a financial expert saying Apple had overstated Samsung's profit margins on mobile products, and the judge telling Apple's lawyer that \"unless you're smoking crack\" there was no chance 75 further witnesses could be called before testimony ended.</p> <p>Witnesses for Samsung testified that Apple should have to pay $422m (\u00a3268m) for infringing the South Korean company's patents in the US with its iPhone and iPad.</p> <p>The case also provided more insight into the famously secretive workings of Apple, revealing how much it pays in patent royalties.</p> <p>Michael Wagner, an accountant who testified on Thursday for Samsung, said Samsung's US profits from the smartphones and tablets targeted in the case should be calculated at about 12%, or $519m.</p> <p>Earlier in the trial, an Apple expert witness, Terry Musika, testified that Samsung's US margin was closer to 35.5% on sales from mid-2010 through to March 2012, and that Samsung's US profits on revenues of $8.16bn were boosted by infringing products.</p> <p>Apple is seeking more than $2.5bn in damages as the two companies stage a bitter courtroom fight that mirrors their broader struggle outside for supremacy in mobile markets.</p> <p>Together they control more than half of worldwide smartphone sales, while Apple dominates in tablets with Samsung a distant second, according to figures from analysts and those released to the court by Samsung.</p> <p>Apple says Samsung copied the design and some features of its iPad and iPhone, and is asking for a sales ban in addition to monetary damages.</p> <p>Samsung, which is trying to expand in the US, says Apple infringed several patents, including some for its key wireless technology.</p> <p>Wagner testified on Thursday that Musika did not take into account many of Samsung's costs, including marketing. \"Not a penny,\" Wagner said. He said his 12% figure assumes a period beginning in April 2011 for most of the mobile products.</p> <p>At the start of the trial, each side was allotted 25 hours by Judge Lucy Koh to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses, a standard procedure in such trials.</p> <p>The case began with Apple, yet it was Samsung that began to feel the time crunch on Thursday, with its lawyers choosing not to cross-examine two of Apple's technical experts who were called in to rebut Samsung's case, which has been made this week, after citing time limits.</p> <p>The two sides began the day with Apple having used 18 hours and one minute, while Samsung had used 22 hours 25 minutes. By the end of the day that had fallen to three hours 53 minutes remaining for Apple, and just 25 minutes for Samsung.</p> <p>Apple's greater amount of time at one point saw its attorney suggest a list of 75 pages of objections to dozens of witnesses who had not yet been called, leading to Judge Koh to exclaim: \"You want me to do an order on 75 pages tonight? When, unless you're smoking crack, you know that these witnesses are not going to be called? Who is going to call all these witnesses when you have less than four hours left?\"</p> <p>Apple's lawyers disclaimed any use of crack cocaine, but insisted they had figured out that they could get through 20 witnesses on Thursday and Friday to rebut Samsung's case. \"We didn't mean to burden the court,\" said Apple's lawyer, Michael Jacobs.</p> <p>Koh told Jacobs that if Apple's timings turned out to be wrong and there was no realistic chance of calling the witnesses: \"I'm going to think up a proper tax for that.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, the case has continued to prove more useful for onlookers interested in the inner workings of both companies, particularly Apple, than to the two opponents.</p> <p>More financial details about the famously secretive Apple were revealed on Thursday. The company has paid about $1.4bn in patent royalties to at least 90 companies, according to testimony from Samsung financial expert Vince O'Brien.</p> <p>Apple has sold $12.23bn worth of iPhones in the US since September 2010, and US sales for the iPad are at $2.29bn since the end of April 2011, Samsung financial expert David Teece said.</p> <p>Other testimony on Thursday focused on how much Apple should pay if the jury finds that Apple violated Samsung's patents.

After three minutes of gunfire, bodies littered the ground in pools of blood. The South African police ministry said more than 30 striking miners had been killed.</p> <p>Newspaper reporter Poloko Tau <a href=\"https://twitter.com/taupoloko\" title=\"\">tweeted from the scene</a>: \"Auto guns creacking [sic] and cocked like 100 at a time, scary \u2026 warzone down here, 1st shot fired \u2026 journalist running, diving and hiding amid shots, water canon spewing water at the strikers \u2026 my contact has just been shot dead \u2026\"</p> <p>The deaths came after a week of turmoil at the Marikana mine that had <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/14/south-africa-lonmin-platinum-mine-clashes\" title=\"\">already seen 10 people killed</a>, including two police officers and two security guards. Lonmin, the world's third biggest platinum producer, was forced to suspend production at the mine, about 60 miles north-west of Johannesburg, after what it called an illegal strike escalated into an alleged turf war between rival unions.</p> <p>His voice shaking with anger, the union leader Joseph Mathunjwa accused the Lonmin management of colluding with a rival union to orchestrate what he described as a massacre. Mathunjwa, president of the militant Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU), told the eNews channel: \"We have to send condolences to those families whose members were brutally murdered by a lack of co-operation from management. We have done our bit. If the management had changed their commitment, surely lives could have been saved.\"</p> <p>South Africa's president, Jacob Zuma, condemned the killings but made no reference to the handling of the situation by the police. \"We are shocked and dismayed at this senseless violence,\" he said. \"We believe there is enough space in our democratic order for any dispute to be resolved through dialogue without any breaches of the law or violence.</p> <p>\"We call upon the labour movement and business to work with government to arrest the situation before it deteriorates any further. I have instructed law enforcement agencies to do everything possible to bring the situation under control and to bring the perpetrators of violence to book.\" Zuma added: \"We extend our deepest condolences to the families of all who have lost their lives since the beginning of this violent action.\"</p> <p>The opposition called for an independent investigation. Helen Zille, leader of the Democratic Alliance, said: \"We call on union leaders, the police and everyone else involved to immediately work towards a de-escalation of the conflict. All action must be taken to avoid further bloodshed.</p> <p>\"An urgent independent investigation is required to determine exactly what happened; and who is responsible for this massacre. The families of everyone involved, and indeed the nation, deserve to know how and why this bloodshed occurred.\"</p> <p>Roger Phillimore, the chairman of Lonmin, said: \"We are treating the developments around police operations this afternoon with the utmost seriousness. The South African police service have been in charge of public order and safety on the ground since the violence between competing labour factions erupted over the weekend, claiming the lives of eight of our employees and two police officers.</p> <p>\"It goes without saying that we deeply regret the further loss of life in what is clearly a public order rather than labour relations associated matter.\"</p> <p>The violence reportedly flared when police laying out barricades of barbed wire were outflanked by some of an estimated 3,000 miners massed on a rocky outcrop near the mine. Witnesses claimed that some of the miners were armed with pistols and fired first, while also charging the police with machetes and sticks.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.cosatu.org.za\" title=\"\">Congress of South African Trade Unions</a> (Cosatu) said: \"According to a Sapa report, police tried to disperse striking workers gathered on top of a hill, wielding pangas and chanting war songs. It ended in a three-minute shootout between the two groups, after police fired teargas and then used a water cannon to disperse the strikers, who retaliated by firing live ammunition at the police.\"</p> <p>The protests began last week when workers demanded a pay increase to 12,500 rand (\u00a3976) a month. The action turned deadly when the AMCU clashed with South Africa's dominant National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).</p> <p>The NUM rejected the charge of collusion with mine bosses. Spokesman Lesiba Seshoka said: \"We are not surprised by his allegation \u2026 It is not true. Everyone can see through these lies.\"</p> <p>Seshoka blamed the AMCU \u2013 which has been poaching NUM members in platinum mines \u2013 for instigating the bloodshed. \"These people said today they want to die on the hilltop. They said they will bring their children to die there. That is why we say the ringleaders must be arrested.\"</p> <p>There has been growing frustration with the governing African National Congress and its mainstream union allies for moving too slowly to deliver wage increases and public services. Radical and militant voices are making gains in some areas.</p> <p>Patrick Craven, the national spokesman for Cosatu, which is aligned to the ANC, said it would \"convene an urgent meeting of the unions' leaderships to discuss what is emerging as a co-ordinated political strategy to use intimidation and violence, manipulated by disgruntled former union leaders, in a concerted drive to create breakaway 'unions' and divide and weaken the trade union movement\".</p> <p>He added: \"Cosatu calls upon all workers to remain vigilant but calm in the face of the most serious challenge to workers' unity and strength for many years.\"</p> <p>South Africa is home to four-fifths of the world's known platinum reserves but has been hit by union militancy and a sharp drop in the price of the precious metal this year. At least three people were killed in fighting in January that led to a six-week closure of the world's biggest platinum mine, run by Impala Platinum. Such incidents are seen as tarnishing South Africa's reputation among investors.</p> <p>This week's violence has forced Lonmin to freeze production at all its South African operations, which account for 12% of global platinum output. The company's London-listed shares fell more than 7% on Thursday. A spokesman at Lonmin's head office in London confirmed strikers had been served with an ultimatum to return to work on Thursday or face dismissal, but denied that might inflame&#xa0;the&#xa0;situation.</p> <p>\"The mine cannot operate without the rock drill operators,\" he said. \"The company tried every avenue it could to negotiate a settlement and we were left with no option.\"</p>",
  "<p>So the Olympics are over, our political leaders have packed their buckets and spades and are now sunning themselves in destinations across Europe and we have a Yorkshireman, born and bred, keeping control of the shop in the form of Foreign Secretary and Richmond MP, William Hague. All well and good.</p> <p>Well not quite, for in the midst of the post-Olympic analysis and the euphoria of the medals won, the Office for National Statics (ONS) this week released what was largely <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/regional-trends/region-and-country-profiles/key-statistics-and-profiles---august-2012/index.html\">unreported material </a>on regional trends across the UK, data which provide particularly worrying reading for the North East. </p> <p>In its profile of the region, the<a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/regional-trends/region-and-country-profiles/key-statistics-and-profiles---august-2012/key-statistics---north-east--august-2012.html\"> ONS revealed </a>that despite it being the smallest UK region, the North East faces some of the biggest policy challenges. For example: </p> <blockquote> <p><strong>The region</strong> produced 10.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO&#xa0;2&#xa0;) emissions per resident in 2009, the highest in any ofl the English regions.</p> <p><strong>Almost 15%</strong> of adults aged 16 to 64 had disabilities that limited their daily activities or work in the North East in the year ending March 2011, the highest region in England.</p> <p><strong>More than</strong> a fifth of children in the North East lived in workless households in Q4 2011 (22.4%), the highest proportion in the UK.</p> <p><strong>Life expectancy</strong> at birth in the region in the three-year period 2008 to 2010 was among the lowest in the UK at 77.2 years for males and 81.2 years for females compared with 78.2 and 82.3 years respectively for the UK.</p> <p><strong>Gross disposable</strong> household income (GDHI) of residents in the North East, at \u00a313,300 per head in 2010, was 15% below the UK average and the lowest of the English regions and countries of the UK.</p> <p><strong>In April 2011</strong>, the median gross weekly earnings for full-time employees on adult rates who were resident in the North East was \u00a3451, lower than the UK median of \u00a3501.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Pretty depressing stuff. But it gets worse. With national figures suggesting <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/15/uk-unemployment-falls-olympics-temporary-jobs\">a drop</a> in unemployment to 8% across the UK, <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_276202.pdf\">the data</a> also points to unemployment of 10.4% in the North East, almost double that of the region with the lowest rate of 5.8% - the South West.

  "<h2><strong>Christine Wilson, head of youth and society, </strong><a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org/\" title=\"\"><strong>British Council</strong></a><strong>, UK</strong></h2> <p><strong>Defining social enterprise:</strong> I like <a href=\"http://www.socialenterprise.org.uk/about/about-social-enterprise\" title=\"\">the Social Enterprise UK definition</a> \u2013 A social enterprise is a business that trades for a social and/or environmental purpose. It will have a clear sense of its social mission, which means it will know what difference it is trying to make, who it aims to help, and how it plans to do it. It will bring in most or all of its income through selling goods or services. And it will also have clear rules about what it does with its profits, reinvesting these to further the social mission.</p> <p><strong>Workshops and networks:</strong> We are working at the moment with partners including the Asia Europe Foundation on a network of social entrepreneurs. We've held three workshops, which combined training, networking and ideas incubation, in Thailand, Burma and Vietnam. British and European entrepreneurs also took part. We try to build strong international networks and support them in supporting each other.</p> <p><strong>NGO to social enterprise:</strong> A lot of the organisations we work with are supporting NGOs in transition to social enterprises. It's not often cut and dried \u2013 in the first few years at least, they are still in receipt of charitable donations or other sources of funding.&#xa0;Other NGOs I have seen start up an enterprise of some sort \u2013 perhaps a charity shop, or some other sort of trading arm \u2013 as an additional source of income. A couple of organisations I recently visited in Burma fit these descriptions - <a href=\"http://www.fxb.org/programs/myanmar/\" title=\"\">FXB Myanmar</a> and <a href=\"http://www.proximitydesigns.org/\" title=\"\">Proximity Design</a>.</p> <p><strong>Sustainability:</strong> If it's not possible to launch an enterprise without getting caught up in legal and regulatory issues, but you still want to create a social action project, then look to ways to make it more sustainable.</p> <p><strong>Role of academics:</strong> Let's also not forget the role that can be played by the academic community. In Turkey, we have worked with <a href=\"http://www.khas.edu.tr/en/\" title=\"\">Kadir Has University</a>, now including social enterprise as part of their lifelong learning programme.</p> <p><strong>Reasons for growth:</strong> In some places, social entrepreneurs are looking for more sustainable ways of tackling issues they face. They feel charitable donations or foundational funding don't offer stability, so they look for more reliable sources of income. In other countries, such as China, there is an interest (as there is in the UK), of delivering better public services (or trying to), by putting power in the hands of the people and communities in receipt of those services.</p> <p><strong>Our work in China:</strong> Here's <a href=\"http://dsi.britishcouncil.org.cn/zh/index.shtml\" title=\"\">some information about our work in China</a> \u2013 and <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">here's some more!</a></p> <p><strong>Young entrepreneurs:</strong> On the global scale, I would speculate that as young people now have a much greater understanding of the wider world around them. We seem to be seeing a generation of young people who want to embed their values and aspirations in their working lives, and not have them as an adjunct.</p> <p><strong>The ability to measure social impact is key:</strong> It's certainly vital in seeking finance \u2013 investors want to know that their money is being well managed and that the organisation is achieving its stated goals. But in addition, I think being able to demonstrate social impact \u2013 people being brought out of poverty, young people having new skills, jobs being created, pollution diminished, whatever the aim of the social entrepreneur \u2013 is crucial to show the world that this is not \"business as usual\".</p> <p><strong>Agricultural projects have potential:</strong> If new technologies and access to state of the art skills and tools could be made affordable and available to greater numbers, then many lives would be enhanced. Proximity Design in Burma is trying to do just that, using local know how about the land, and local engineering skills, combined with expertise in design and innovation, to bring effective and affordable tools to local farmers.</p> <p><strong>Umbrella organisations:</strong> There is the umbrella organisation route, where social enterprises fund a central body to represent them, offer support and so on.&#xa0;We are trying to create more opportunities for entrepreneurs in the UK and the rest of the world to engage, share practice and have dialogue on policy, so keep an eye on the International Hub.</p> <h2><strong>Petra Kroon, owner of </strong><a href=\"http://www.goedgeefs.nl/#/home/\" title=\"\"><strong>bureau goedgeefs</strong></a><strong>, Netherlands</strong></h2> <p><strong>Defining social enterprise:</strong> The rather classical one that states that a social entrepreneur is somebody who wants to solve a social problem \u2013 whether it's people or planet \u2013 in an entrepreneurial way. At least 50%, and some even say 75%, of the revenues are own income \u2013 so no grants or subsidy. Others define \"entrepreneurial\" in the same way as Melinda Gates did at <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/pages/tedxchange_overview\" title=\"\">TEDxChange</a>: using entrepreneurial strategies to solve a social problem.</p> <p><strong>Budget cuts:</strong> As budgets are being cut at this very moment, they turn to institutional grants as a solution. But that is not an entrepreneurial attitude, that's just replacing subsidies for grants. In Holland there is still the attitude that you earning money by doing good isn't the right thing. So, in order to survive I think they need to have a more entrepreneurial attitude, be more pro-active and be more open-minded.</p> <p><strong>NGOs to social enterprises:</strong> In Holland subsidies to NGO's are being cut and they're all thinking about how to survive. I think many people need to learn from others who made the switch from NGO to social enterprise.</p> <p><strong>Organisations working in social entrepreneurship:</strong> There are not so many organisations that are involved in social entrepreneurship. There used to be the <a href=\"http://www.dutchfoundation.com/\" title=\"\">Dutch Foundation</a> of social entrepreneurship but because of a lack of money and a lack of interest it was shut down. I think for over 10 years Ashoka tried to enter Dutch market, but it didn't succeed. But for some time now some people are working on the introduction of Social Enterprise NL, an initiative that focuses on helping and promoting social entrepreneurship. It looks really promising and it is set to launch in September.</p> <p><strong>Financial crisis a good thing?</strong> I must say, I sometimes praised the crisis. Because it made people think of how they can work in an social entrepreneurial way. It made them look at the real problems, not at the problems the grant-takers or governments want to solve. So the crises also gave a boost to social enterprise, to the people who were already involved and also to the idea and image of social enterprise.</p> <p><strong>More focus on social innovation:</strong> In Holland there is a focus on ecological or green innovation while social innovations is left behind. But with government backing in this area, it will develop.</p> <p><strong>Lack of legal structure:</strong> In UK you can register as CIC, in US as B Corps. Here in Holland we are a bit jealous about that.</p> <p><strong>Scaling up:</strong> It's an important issue. In Holland there are no large social enterprises. I have several discussions about scaling up. Of course, as a social enterprise you want to scale your social impact. But do you scale by having more employees in a quantitative way, or do you scale in a qualitative way? In other words, staying small but improving your service or product.</p> <p><strong>Foundations and enterprises:</strong> In Holland there is a big difference between foundations and enterprise. As a foundation it is almost impossible to get investments because you're obliged to use your profits to fulfill your mission. As a foundation you are not allowed to pay it to your shareholders. Meanwhile, as an enterprise it is very hard to find any grants or subsidies because the grant-makers state that they don't want their money to be used to develop an enterprise that is going to make profits.</p> <h2><strong>Nadya Saib \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4v-2NK9R2U\" title=\"\"><strong>Wangsa Jelita</strong></a><strong>, Indonesia</strong></h2> <p><strong>Defining social entrepreneurship:</strong> I personally would go with Professor Yunus on his book \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Creating-World-Without-Poverty-Capitalism/dp/1586484931\" title=\"\">Creating a World Without Poverty: Social Business and the Future of Capitalism</a>\", here I quote: \"any innovative initiative to help people may be described as social entrepreneurship. The initiative may be economic or non-economic, for-profit or not-for-profit\". I once <a href=\"http://nadya-saib.blogspot.com/2012/01/social-entrepreneurship-vs-social.html\" title=\"\">wrote about this on my blog,</a> but of course&#xa0;it's not the defining that matters, it's the doing to create the better world that is much more important.</p> <p><strong>NGO support:</strong> There are a lot of foreign NGOs trying to support local social entrepreneurs. In Indonesia for example, when I started to form my social enterprise I was supported by a program initiated by <a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org/indonesia.htm\" title=\"\">British Council Indonesia</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guinness.com/en-row/agf/\" title=\"\">Arthur Guinness Fund</a>. It was a huge stepping stone for us to develop our business and at the same time tackling social problems.</p> <p><strong>Connecting with the community:</strong> One of the biggest challenges I face is engaging the community. It took us more than a year to finally convince them to collaborate with us. The first time we talked to farmers about value added production in making soaps out of roses it did not go that smoothly. But when we demonstrated how it works they understood how it helped them become less dependent on the middleman.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Lack of professional skills:</strong> None of the founders of Wangsa Jelita had a background in business or management. In dealing with this we are helped by being mentored or coached from someone who is expert in certain area that we want to work on.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/richardjcatherall\" title=\"\"><strong>Richard Catherall</strong></a><strong>, founder of Katarsis Ventures, Cyprus</strong></h2> <p><strong>Business modelling:</strong> This is just as relevant to non-profits as it is for profit focused organisations. It can help people start to broaden what they think about that evil word! For example, social profits, financial profits, environmental profits. Fundamentally modelling helps them to put all the essential elements of a focused enterprise together. This overtakes the focus on profit or non-profit and allows impact and customer orientation to emerge.</p> <p><strong>Value of internships:</strong> Quite a broad partnership here in Cyprus has started with action around internships. Early findings have provided rich insights into the culture change required within companies and with students. Some really interesting ideas emerging about life-long networks and associations that could support very talented people to start an international career while keeping their unique island home as the hub.</p> <p><strong>CSR strategy:</strong> Employability and employment are emerging as the principle CSR activity. What I love about here, is that, from whatever sector, the focus is always on the issue. So with CSR they are focused on the problem, being creative about how each sector can play a role. Then, when there is excitement and clarity, the companies are willing to invest alongside others. This includes NGOs and social enterprises committing their own resources. They believe they have to have a CSR strategy rather than believing they should be someone else's CSR strategy. So for example, instead of working up a project on employability and trying to raise project funds, they collaborate earlier and then engage in what is created by those stakeholders. The largest companies accept a role in holding court over these developments including some of the development costs. The success is everyone playing their part based on what they have, rather than competing for a role they want.</p> <p><strong>Support for managers:</strong> Linked to employability there is also an acceptance that, in lieu of having had this effort in place there is a generation of managers that also need support. So this then links to efforts to build capacity of managers and leaders within organisations. This is something that we have just started to target.</p> <p><strong>Investment culture:</strong> There is investment here into family firms and groups of companies, there are also some small foundations, which are not as apolitical as they could be. There may be an opportunity under the banner of sustainable investment to keep a useful link between investment in companies and investment in social enterprises and NGOs. I don't mean one size fits all, I mean a strategic approach to sustainable investment which is tailored for each sector.</p> <p><strong>Investment readiness:</strong> I have worked with organisations that were almost born investment ready and organisation that will never be investment ready. The investment readiness process we use was tested as part of a programme with <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/\" title=\"\">NESTA</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Cabinet Office</a>. The process of getting investment ready &#xa0;took consideration of the fact that the organisations are most likely to be already a going concern, rather than a start up. </p> <p><strong>CIC model is great:</strong> My partner in Radical Capital was instrumental in encouraging a greater dividend limit. This is because the original (5%) would have blocked out more social investors. It is a bit like our definition debate though. Just because you have a useful structure doesn't make you a great enterprise. I have worked with excellent social enterprises using 'for-profit' structures that have been able to access capital and move money for reinvestment more easily than they would as a CIC.</p> <p><strong>Growing in underdeveloped markets:</strong> They will be challenged to become market makers and that is something we will become involved in. This is not just a test of their business model, but how their commitment to achieving the goal informs their ideas for educating stakeholders, customers and investors. Social enterprises and enterprising NGOs will engage with businesses in the commercial sectors differently. In lieu of project funding and programmes, some may lay solid foundations by doing business together.</p> <h2><strong>Manju George, co-founder and head of corporate development at </strong><a href=\"http://intellecap.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Intellecap</strong></a><strong>, India</strong></h2> <p><strong>Farming and social enterprise:</strong> Agriculture and rural business is one of the sectors we focus on and we have an awards track dedicated to this sector <a href=\"http://www.sankalpforum.com\" title=\"\">in our annual forum</a>. A community based example is the <a href=\"http://www.masuta.org/\" title=\"\">Masutha producers company</a> (created by <a href=\"http://www.pradan.net/\" title=\"\">PRADAN</a>, the NGO). A slightly more commercial example can be INI Farms, a company that does commercial pomegranate cultivation. There are also efforts to increase land productivity.</p> <p><strong>NGOs shifting to social enterprise in India:</strong> Most microfinance institutions in India started at NGOs in the 1990's and early 2000's and by 2005 almost all made the shift to a for-profit legal structure. Those that came after started as for-profits directly.</p> <p><strong>Water-focused social enterprises:</strong> Community based water treatment plants, initially a largely NGO led activity, is now adopted by many for-profit models. Education, largely the domain of NGOs now have many private players \u2013 affordable private schools, night schools and remedial education, alternative curriculum developers and so on. Vocational skill training is another area where there is a huge shift to private sector activity.</p> <p><strong>Support is always needed:</strong> Anybody trying to promote and catalyse social enterprise activity needs to make sure that they make available a variety of support that the social enterprises need. This includes money, connections, advice, hand holding, visibility and information. A narrower approach will not really move the needle. There needs to be an 'ecosystem' of people, tools and policies that support them. One organisation may not be able to do all; but multiple organisations complementary to each other can create this ecosystem.</p> <p><strong>Eco-problems:</strong> When we talk of the ecosystem, it is also important to recognise that there are some industry/market level challenges that need to be dealt with beyond direct support to the social enterprise \u2013 for instance the lack of awareness about off grid and renewable energy solutions, lack of access to consumer and SME finance and lack of quality assurance and standards are common challenges that multiple energy social enterprise face in India. There has to be intervention that try and tackle these, help 'build the market' and make it easier for the social enterprise. This is where philanthropic capital can play a significant role to play (for example <a href=\"http://www.lightingafrica.org/\" title=\"\">IFC's Lighting Africa program</a> and the recently launched Lighting India program).</p> <p><strong>For-profit structures have better prospects:</strong> Not surprisingly, social enterprises with for-profit structures have access to a larger and diverse pool of capital that can fuel their growth and impacts much faster. Most NGO-microfinance to for-profit microfinance transformations saw this happen. Growth of microfinance in India between 2005 and 2011 was phenomenal. However, it also brought along with it the debate on 'how much profits is good and acceptable'. How to balance making money for the investors and deepening social impact?</p> <p><strong>Financial crisis has increased focus on social enterprise:</strong> I was at the <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/\" title=\"\">Davos Forum</a> earlier this year and of course the dominant theme was the need to 'reimagine capitalism' and to find a 'new economic models that is inclusive and responsible'. Many seem to highlight social entrepreneurs and their work as pioneering in this regard and as proof that you can do good and well.</p> <p><strong>The need to go mainstream:</strong> Most social enterprises remain small, doing work in local communities, lack access to resources and find it difficult to scale their operations and are no way comparable to mainstream business corporations. The idea is still not as 'mainstream' as I would like it to be.</p> <p><strong>Awareness of CSR is encouraging:</strong> We are also encouraged by the growing interest from large corporations simply because we need them to address the magnitude of development challenges we face in countries like India. Social enterprises can't do this alone. Last year we started some work with DFID managing their Business Innovation Facility in India; we work with large corporations here and many are looking to get involved. However, the general risk tolerance is definitely much lower than a social enterprise. They will not put big money in without the business case being absolutely clear.</p> <p><strong>Social enterprise in India is rapidly on the rise:</strong> In our annual awards forum, we get close to 60 new social enterprise applications every year. And many are significantly larger than employing 250 people. We recently surveyed 100 social enterprises in India and at least one third of them are operating in over 100 localities and touching more than 50,000 base of the pyramid lives annually. Before the microfinance crisis in India in 2010, the largest MFI has over 40,000 employees including field staff. So certainly the scale is much larger, but not enough as we still have 300-400 million people below the poverty line.</p> <h2><strong>Yoshiaki Ishikawa, social agenda lab manager at the </strong><a href=\"http://www.etic.or.jp/english/outline.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Entrepreneurial Training for Innovative Communities (ETIC)</strong></a><strong>, Japan</strong></h2> <p><strong>Social enterprise and disaster recovery:</strong> I'm in Sendai, where is a capital city around the disaster area. This year we've started a social entrepreneur incubation program for disaster recovery. Many young entrepreneurs are trying to transform old traditional industry such as agriculture and fisheries. This is also a good opportunity to re-construct disaster area.</p> <p><strong>On the fringes:</strong> 'Social enterprise' is not very common yet, especially outside of Tokyo. If you pick people in crossroad of Shibuya (where our office locates) and ask if they know about social enterprise, only 1-2% would know. But innovators know what they are and corroboration between social enterprises and companies is getting more and more common.</p> <p><strong>Triple crisis not financial crisis encouraged social enterprise:</strong> 2008 crisis pushed issues but didn't empower social entrepreneurship nor the companies to be more social. Some of them reduced their CSR budget. What did change people's perceptions was <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2011/03/16-japan-disaster-kaufmann\" title=\"\">the triple crisis of 2011</a>.</p> <p><strong>Fellowship program for the next generation:</strong> We've done it with more than 4,000 college students throughout Japan. And last year, we started to involve young professionals <a href=\"http://www.etic.or.jp/recoveryleaders/en/\" title=\"\">to support disaster area too</a>. We've sent over 100, and it's a bit contributing changing mindset and attitude or \"work\" in Japan.</p> <h2><strong>Drew Tulchin, managing partner of </strong><a href=\"http://www.socialenterprise.net/\" title=\"\"><strong>Social Enterprise Associates</strong></a><strong>, US</strong></h2> <p><strong>Defining social enterprise in US:</strong> There is not one definition in the US but generally it means that a company creates a positive impact by doing business. So also a market-based approach by practitioners.</p> <p><strong>Alternatives to Wall Street:</strong> I don't know if there actually are more social enterprise in terms of numbers because of the financial crisis. But it probably has lead to new forms of social enterprises and topics for them like Slow Money NYC who state \"We hope to reshape roles for investors and extend the definition of investment, providing alternatives to Wall Street.\"</p> <p><strong>Legal status:</strong> In the US there actually is a legal status (<a href=\"http://www.bcorporation.net/\" title=\"\">B Corp</a>). It's quite new and was first introduced by the State of New York and now passed in eight or nine States. It's also a result of the financial crisis, which also emerged because of the need to increase shareholder value. The new legislation allows B Corps to prioritise stakeholder value (social and environmental).</p> <h2><strong>Bharti Patel, headed </strong><a href=\"http://www.svaraj.in/\" title=\"\"><strong>Society for Voluntary Actions Revitalisation and Justice</strong></a><strong>, India</strong></h2> <p><strong>Business acumen is crucial:</strong> There is an urgent need for such input \u2014 writing a good business plan for a social and green enterprise can go a long way towards achieving the desired results and sustainability. It also helps to convince banks to provide the necessary credit. A suggestion to create a local voluntary time bank where such expertise can be tapped into by the entrepreneur.</p> <p><strong>Double crisis:</strong> there are two crisis which need to be considered in the modern definition of business. 1) no doubt the financial crisis but increasingly it is 2) the crisis of depleting natural resources which are affecting business globally. But disproportionately those whose livelihood is directly impacted by changes in land, water and eco-system. The recent debate on green economy is important in the context of new social enterprise.</p> <p><strong>India needs leadership:</strong> The social impact of the organization together with the environmental best practices /impact gives a true picture of the social enterprise in the modern global economic development paradigm. I do believe India can and should show real leadership here. <a href=\"http://www.deccanherald.com/content/248022/why-india-should-embrace-sdgs.html\" title=\"\">Here's my article</a> highlighting India's traditional practices have done much, but their efforts are dismissed as small scale and backwards.</p> <h2><strong>Laura Fedorciow, co-founder of </strong><a href=\"http://www.vertigoventures.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Vertigo Ventures</strong></a><strong>, UK</strong></h2> <p><strong>Vocational training:</strong> Interesting point about vocational training. Here in the UK we have seen that some charities have started providing training on their core skills to generate their own revenue. LeapCC is one such example. Some small to medium charities are evolving particularly at the moment as donations have slowed here.</p> <p><strong>Philanthropy is rife:</strong> When we were in New Orleans, we were amazed by the number of graduates from across the USA who moved down there to help with the clean up for a period of time. Even more surprising was how they were staying and setting up lives there. The AmeriCorps were also supportive in sending volunteers which may be a useful model? <a href=\"http://www.stbernardproject.org/\" title=\"\">See the St. Bernard Project.</a></p> <p><strong>Partnering with businesses:</strong> In the USA we saw this a lot, where companies such as Macy's would help build a social enterprise building at a University or perhaps sit on their social enterprise company board to provide commercial advice to the team. Being open to new/different ways of engaging with social enterprises is key to supporting the ecosystem and its development as there are commercial lessons to be learnt as well.</p> <h2><strong>Rathish Balakrishnan</strong></h2> <p><strong>Student fellowships:</strong> One of the trends in India is for students to apply for \"fellowships\" which are often one to two years of immersive experience in a social setting where they work with the community to come up with solutions to social problems.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Private patients on the NHS could be at risk of being overcharged after the Office of Fair Trading warned of price fixing.</p> <p>The OFT said a whistleblower had disclosed evidence that suggested that eight NHS trusts had exchanged \"commercially sensitive information\" about treatment charges.</p> <p>It said it had seen email exchanges between the trusts.</p> <p>The consumer protection watchdog said the trusts, which are part of the Southern Region Private Healthcare Association, avoided a formal investigation after voluntarily agreeing not to share pricing information.</p> <p>The OFT said it would be writing to all NHS hospitals which operate private health units to warn them that they could be in breach of competition law if they share such information.</p> <p>Deborah Jones, director in the OFT's services, infrastructure and public markets group, said the organisation would step in if it received further evidence of non-compliance.</p> <p>\"We welcome the assurances given by these Trusts which have enabled us to bring our preliminary investigation to a close,\" she said. \"However, this does not preclude the OFT from investigating any aspect of hospital trusts' economic activities if it receives further evidence of potential infringements of the law.
