  "<p>Animal welfare campaigners were celebrating a victory on Thursday night as the only UK port to export live sheep and calves said it was suspending the trade following a debacle which prompted the destruction of more than 40 injured and lame animals.</p> <p>In a statement, Thanet district council, which owns the port of Ramsgate, said it had temporarily halted live animal exports with immediate effect after the dramatic events on Wednesday.</p> <p>The council, which has made no secret of its desire to see the trade disappear from its port, said that, while the suspension was temporary, \"its lifting will depend on the construction of suitable facilities\". It added: \"Providing the facilities will depend on the cost of building and running such a facility, and also whether it is a priority of the council in comparison with other issues.\"</p> <p>Ian Driver, a councillor and campaigner against live exports, said: \"I would say the animal exporters shouldn't hold their breath. The council has much more important priorities than supporting a barbaric trade.\"</p> <p>Ever since May 2011, when a former Soviet tank carrier by the name of Joline moved its trade along the south coast from Dover to Ramsgate, dozens of protesters have turned out every week to call for an end to the trade, which they say is unnecessarily cruel.</p> <p>The RSPCA has kept up the pressure as well, carrying out lorry inspections along with officials from the government's animal health agency to check animals were being carried on their journeys in acceptable welfare conditions.</p> <p>But it was the debacle of Wednesday which prompted the council to move on the issue, as sheep from a lorry stopped at the port had to be shot on the advice of the RSPCA, The organisation's chief executive Gavin Grant met government ministers on Thursday morning to press for a ban.</p> <p>According to the RSPCA, 41 sheep from the lorry had to be shot due to severe lameness, two were put to sleep due to injuries, and two others were accidentally drowned during the unloading process. The lorry carrying the animals was stopped on Wednesday morning and declared unfit to travel due to faults in the vehicle. The RSPCA said the lorry had also been declared unfit to travel last month.</p> <p>Council leader Clive Hart said: \"Thanet district council recognises that live exports are a lawful trade, but we are also conscious of our responsibilities regarding the welfare of animals passing through our port. We are saddened to see animals arrive at our port in this condition and it underlines the need to implement EU regulations strictly in order to avoid any suffering caused to the animals.\"</p> <p>The council had previously sought legal advice over the exports, but was told it was obliged to act as a \"free port\" under the 1847 Harbours Act.</p> <p>Philip Lymbery of the charity Compassion in World Farming hailed the move, adding: \"We now look to Defra to finish it off, once and for all. We call on Defra to take permanent action to stop the live animal export trade reopening, in Ramsgate or anywhere else.\"</p> <p>The government says it is also opposed to the export of live creatures and would prefer to see animals slaughtered as close to where they are reared as possible, but cannot impose a nationwide ban on the trade due to EU legislation.</p> <p>Campaigners warn that, without a blanket ban, the trade could move elsewhere in Britain.</p>",
  "<p>US campaign finance rules, which have allowed wealthy individuals to pour millions of dollars into the 2012 presidential election, have shaken public confidence in the political process, according to a report by the Global Commission on Elections, Democracy and Security.</p> <p>The commission, which is headed by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan, and comprises former world leaders and Nobel prize winners, has identified a rise in \"uncontrolled, undisclosed, illegal and opaque\" political finance across the world as a key threat to electoral integrity, in a new report due to be launched in the UK on Friday.</p> <p>The report singles out the US as an example of a country where lack of transparency and controls in political finance have left it struggling to restore the public's confidence in its elected officials to act in their interest.</p> <p>The commission blamed a series of court decisions \u2013 in particular the controversial Citizens United ruling, which turned campaign finance reform on its head and spawned Super Pacs, effectively removing barriers to corporate and union spending to influence elections </p> <p>Citizens United has \"undermined political equality, weakened transparency of the electoral process and shaken citizen confidence in America's political institutions and elections\", the report said.</p> <p>It also criticises US states which have sought to introduce voter identification laws and other measures that have the effect of suppressing African American participation in the political process.</p> <p>Vidar Helgessen, secretary general of International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, said that US system was cited as just one example of flaws in democracies worldwide. But, he said the US, as the most powerful nation in the world, had a responsibility to set an example.</p> <p>\"If a vast majority of citizens say the systems is undermining political equality and weakening transparency of the electoral process, then there is an issue of trust in the government,\" he said.</p> <p>Political finance was an important issue which had not received the attention and reform it deserved, he said.</p> <p>\"We are seeing increasing inequality and we are in a global economic recession and it is an issue that will only grow. It is not only in new and emerging democracies that provide challenges and have elections that lack integrity\"</p> <p>The report cited a national survey this year by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University law school, <a href=\"http://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/national_survey_super_pacs_corruption_and_democracy/\">which found a majority of people</a> believe nominally independent Super Pacs to be a danger to democracy. </p> <p>\"Nearly two-thirds of Americans said that they trust government less because big donors have more influence over election officials than average Americans,\" the report said.</p> <p>It concluded that, although Super Pacs must disclose their contributors and may not coordinate directly with candidates by law, in practice, \"both constraints have been flouted\".</p> <p>It compared the US unfavourably to Canada, which has faced many of the same campaign finance struggles and concludes: \"In contrast to the USA, Canada has managed to strike a balance between safeguarding individuals speech and protecting the overall integrity of the electoral process.\"</p> <p>It argued that the rise of \"uncontrolled political finance\" was one of five major threats to democracy, which could rob it of its unique strengths to promote political equality, the empowerment of the disenfranchised and the ability to manage societal conflicts peacefully.</p> <p>The report looked at a host of problems, including post-election violence in places such as Kenya and Nigeria, illicit finance in Costa Rica, and disenfranchised populations in Europe.</p>",

The time displayed by the fourth official is a minimum, not a maximum. You are the timekeeper, and it is up to you whether to make an allowance in time to take account of a new stoppage. You cannot let this behaviour go. If you view the complaints as unduly aggressive then show the captain a second yellow for dissent, followed by a red \u2013 otherwise a firm word will suffice. You can make a further allowance in time to take account of this new delay.

The kick has not been taken, so a (braver) colleague is now able to take it.

  "<p>Surrey's Zander de Bruyn made his first hundred of the County Championship season on a day where it became clear that the former captain Rory Hamilton-Brown was likely to leave the club.</p> <p>Shortly after stumps on day three of the rain-affected match between Surrey and Lancashire at Aigburth, the club released a statement on Hamilton-Brown's future.</p> <p>It said: \"Surrey CCC can confirm they have received statements of interest from a number of counties with regards to the future of batsman Rory Hamilton-Brown. After discussions between the player and the coaching staff, Surrey have made the decision to allow Rory to enter into discussions with these counties with immediate effect.\"</p> <p>Hamilton-Brown has been on compassionate leave for much of the season following the death of his friend and team-mate Tom Maynard.</p> <p>It had looked as if being put into bat on a pitch which had spent two days under damp covers would be quite a chore for Surrey. However, Lancashire made a wayward start which saw the 18-year-old wicketkeeper Alex Davies, playing in his first four-day fixture, frequently asked to retrieve balls at full stretch down the leg side.</p> <p>It was a surprise then when Zafar Ansari had his off stump knocked back by another Lancashire debutant Tom Bailey. From here, though, Rory Burns took control of the morning session, passing fifty in 79 balls.</p> <p>It was shortly before lunch that De Bruyn came to the wicket and after the interval he took his partnership with Burns past 50. Burns eventually departed for 73 when Davies took his first catch in county cricket off the bowling of Tom Smith.</p> <p>De Bruyn was clearly keen to put bat to ball hitting two straight sixes off the bowling of the left-arm spinner Simon Kerrigan who bowled throughout the afternoon session.</p> <p>At the other end Luke Procter made a double breakthrough for Lancashire when he bowled Jason Roy for 13 and Steven Davies for a duck two balls later. However, that brought the allrounder Tom Jewell to the crease and the pair amassed a 146-run partnership, Jewell eventually finishing with 57 not out and De Bruyn reaching his century in just under 4 hours from 221 deliveries.</p> <p>Afterwards he said: \"It has been a hard season this year and it is my first hundred so I am really happy. I've been working hard the last month or so and really wanted to get that hundred, so it is nice to get it in the last game.</p> <p>\"We kind of knew the first two days were going to be a bit rain affected but we knew the third day was going to be nice. When we batted we knew it was going to be a good wicket, so I just wanted to get in and play from there and get a nice rhythm to my batting.\"</p>",

He attended the Seal special forces medical school and also trained as a sniper. He served in the military in Iraq and Afghanistan. After he left the navy in 2005 he moved into private security he spent time in Israel, Pakistan and Kenya, among other countries. He also previously served a three month stint in Libya.</p> <p>Quigley said Libya \"wasn't his favourite place\".</p> <p>Doherty told ABC News last month that he was working with the state department in Libya to <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/glen-doherty-navy-seal-killed-libya-intel-mission/story?id=17229037#.UFI3MNCXRQW\">track down missiles</a> that can shoot down planes which were looted from military bases during the fall of Muammar Gaddafi. US officials were concerned thousands of the missing shoulder-fired missiles could fall into the hands of extremist groups.</p> <p>\"Doherty said that he travelled throughout Libya chasing reports of the weapons and once they were found, his team would destroy them on the spot by bashing them with hammers or repeatedly running them over with their vehicles,\" ABC wrote.</p> <p>Doherty also sat on the board of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, an organisation combating religious influence in the military.</p> <p>Quigley said she doubted her brother was the victim of a random protest over an anti-Muslim film.</p> <p>\"You have to understand, Glen was highly trained. He was the best of the best. He wouldn't have gone down for some protest over a movie,\" she said. \"This was serious, well-planned, well-executed. He was very good at what he did.\" Quigley said: \"He always knew the dangers, but he never talked about it. ... He's been going overseas since 9/11, and he's always made it back.\"</p> <h2>Sean Smith, 'Vile Rat' in online gaming community</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396131750\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/13/1347569682175/Sean-Smith-010.jpg\" alt=\"Sean Smith\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sean Smith was a 34-year-old father of two.

  "<p>The colossal success of A Separation has triggered an interest in director Asghar Farhadi's back catalogue and now his previous work, from 2009, has come to the UK. It is a really absorbing picture, powerfully acted, disturbing and suspenseful. Like A Separation it challenges the sexual politics of contemporary Iran and further shows how different Farhadi is from the older&#xa0;generation of Iranian masters such as Kiarostami and Makhmalbaf. The points of reference for About Elly are probably more European: Polanski's Knife in the Water, Antonioni's L'Avventura; and Farhadi also has Michael Haneke's beady eye for the dynamics and symptoms of&#xa0;group guilt.</p> <p>A group of friends \u2013 well-to-do professionals from Tehran \u2013 have gone on holiday together to the seaside, with their young children. Farhadi shows that this is a trip they have organised quite impulsively: when they arrive, there is some confusion about where they are supposed to be staying, and they have to move into a beachfront villa that happens to be vacant, but is chaotic and derelict. And there is something else. One of the party, the vivacious Sepideh (Golshifteh Farahani) has invited along someone of whom they know next to nothing: a young woman called Elly (Taraneh Alidoosti), who is their children's teacher. Mischievous Sepideh is hoping to set Elly up with the single friend in their party: Ahmad (Shahab Hosseini), who is recently divorced and has just returned&#xa0;from a long stay doing business in Germany.</p> <p>Ahmad and Elly good-naturedly see what is going on, and even go along with it, to the extent of having an intimate conversation when they go off together on an errand in the car. But Farhadi creates strange swirls and eddies of tension. The rest of the group make gigglingly raucous jokes about the impending wedding when Elly is out of the room but the ensuing discomfort \u2013 in which Sepideh appears to be a participant \u2013 appears to go beyond mere embarrassment. Eventually there is a crisis and a bizarre disappearance, and the aftermath exposes the fault lines in the group's relationship, as secrets and lies come to the surface.</p> <p>About Elly confirms Farhadi's shrewd judgment of pace, dramatic technique and formal control of an ensemble cast. Anyone who admired A Separation will want to see it (one cast member of that film, Peyman Moadi, appears here) but it stands on its own as a fascinating psychological drama.</p>",
  "<p>The pace of the British withdrawal from Afghanistan could quicken next year because military commanders have changed their views about how many troops need to remain to help local security forces fight the Taliban, the defence secretary has said.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Philip Hammond admitted that six months ago the military was privately pushing \"for keeping force levels as high as possible for as long as possible\".</p> <p>But he said British military thinking was evolving because commanders had been \"surprised by the extent to which they have been able to draw back and leave the Afghans to take the lion's share of the combat role\".</p> <p>The UK has closed 52 of its military bases and checkpoints in Helmand province over the last six months, leaving 34 still operating, he revealed.</p> <p>\"I think there is a bit of a rethinking going on about how many troops we do actually need \u2026 there may be some scope for a little bit more flexibility on the way we draw down, and that is something commanders on the ground are looking at very actively.\"</p> <p>Though Hammond refused to go into details and said no decisions had been taken, this is the first acknowledgment from the government that the UK's long march out of Afghanistan could accelerate markedly next year, rather than waiting until 2014 \u2013 the end date for the British military effort in Helmand, which began in 2006.</p> <p>In the interview Hammond also said:</p> <p>\u2022 He was concerned that the rioting which led to the murder of the US ambassador in Libya could spread to Afghanistan, and measures had been taken to beef up security around British bases, and prevent the \"unnecessary exposure of personnel\" to potential trouble, especially on Friday after prayers.</p> <p>\u2022 Britain would not be \"spooked\" by the spate of \"green on blue\" attacks this year \u2013 where Afghan troops killed their British colleagues. He revealed that 60 soldiers had been sacked from the Afghan army in recent weeks, and 600 others were being scrutinised by a joint UK/Afghan inquiry into the killings. He said the UK had found serious weaknesses in the way Afghan soldiers were being managed.</p> <p>\u2022 Britons would have to \"get used to the idea\" that any peace in Afghanistan will need to involve \"reaching out Northern Ireland-style to at least the moderate part of the insurgency, to try to bring it inside through reconciliation and integration\".</p> <p>\u2022 The Afghan government needed to do much more to bring about a political settlement with the insurgents because the diplomatic effort was lagging behind the military campaign.</p> <p>During a trip to Afghanistan in which he met President Hamid Karzai in Kabul and mingled with troops at the British base in Camp Bastion, Hammond was frank about the situation in Afghanistan and what he regarded as the UK's principal objectives.</p> <p>However, it is his remarks on the \"draw down\" that will provoke interest among all Britain's partners in Nato's International Security and Assistance Force.</p> <p>Britain is withdrawing 500 troops by the end of this year, leaving 9,000.</p> <p>But though the extent and timing of next year's withdrawal will depend on US plans, this is Hammond's first admission that British commanders are now reassessing how many troops they need \u2013 because, he said, they have been encouraged at the way Afghan National Security Forces have taken to the battle.</p> <p>This could lead to thousands more troops coming home next year than might have been expected, a withdrawal that would probably start in September.</p> <p>\"I think that the message I am getting clearly from the military is that it might be possible to draw down further troops in 2013,\" Hammond said. \"Whereas six months ago the message coming from them was that we really need to hold on to everything we have got for as long as we possibly can. I think they are seeing potentially more flexibility in the situation.</p> <p>\"Talking to senior commanders you get a clear sense that their view of force levels is evolving in light of their experiences.\"</p> <p>He was also unusually blunt about Britain's role in Afghanistan. Now that al-Qaida had been \"eliminated\" from the country, it was not right to ask troops to put their lives at risk for nation-building, he said.</p> <p>\"We have to be clear why we came here in the first place. I believe very clearly that if we are going to ask British troops to put themselves in the firing line, we can only do that to protect UK vital national security interests.</p> <p>\"We can ask troops who are here to help build a better Afghanistan, but we cannot ask them to expose themselves to risk for those tasks. We can only ask them to expose themselves to risk for Britain's national security, which is what they signed up to do.\"</p> <p>Hammond said the UK had \"not come here to defeat the insurgency\". Britain just needed to help contain the insurgency to stop terrorists getting a foothold again.</p> <p>He said Britain, in an ideal world, would like to see Afghanistan become more democratic, with a society that respected human rights and improved education. But he insisted that was not the ultimate measure of success.</p> <p>\"The ultimate measure of success must be the extent to which we can leave Afghanistan in a state that will continue to deny its territory to international terrorists,\" he said.</p> <p>Despite ongoing fighting in Helmand that has led to more than 20 British troops being killed in recent months, including five in \"green on blue\" attacks, Hammond said the security situation was improving, and that Afghan forces were now able to protect the main towns, pushing the insurgents into the desert areas.</p> <p>But in a swipe at the diplomatic efforts to secure peace, Hammond said \"tracking people down and removing them from the battlefield\" was not the best way of finding a settlement.</p> <p>\"There needs to be, in my judgment, greater weight given to the high level political initiative for reconciliation. We recognise that Afghan society is such that it is pretty difficult to imagine a situation where there won't be any level of insurgency \u2026 but it is also difficult to imagine in the long run a stable prosperous and sustainable Afghanistan that has not managed to reintegrate and reconcile at least a significant part of the insurgency.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The Afghan government needs to do more and the neighbours who have influence [Pakistan] also need to maintain pressure on those parties \u2026 to come to the table. We have to provide them with expert support. They want to do it, but turning a wish into reality is a complex process.</p> <p>\"I think most of us feel that the political process is not moving as fast as the military process and we would like to see political progress keeping pace with military progress.\"</p> <p>Accommodating the Taliban in the peace and reconciliation process was vital, he said.</p> <p>\"Look at our own history. Every counter-insurgency war we have fought in post-colonial history has ended up with an accommodation with at least part of the insurgency movement.</p> <p>\"That is the reality. You cannot create a lasting settlement with \u2026 a significant part of the population locked out. You have to bring moderates into the process to lock out the extremists as we have done in Northern Ireland.\"</p> <p>In July three British troops were killed by an Afghan colleague in one of a series of \"green on blue\" attacks against Isaf forces this year. More than 40 Nato troops have died since January by these insider attacks, which is having a debilitating affect on morale \u2013 and has prompted France to declare it is withdrawing troops early.</p> <p>Hammond said he had spoken to Karzai and told him that \"while we [the British government] might not be spooked by this, public opinion feels very strongly about these green on blue incidents and it is absolutely essential that this problem is put back in its box\".</p> <p>The defence secretary said he had been \"talking to one of the senior officers about one of the green on blue incidents, and the investigation has thrown up serious weaknesses in the way that some elements of Afghan troops have been managed in the past\".</p> <p>He added: \"The Afghans are moving to address those problems and we are all over it. Where we have pointed the finger at people, the Afghans haven't hesitated to arrest them and check them out.\"</p> <p>He said it might not be possible to eliminate the green on blue threat completely, but he believed the measures that had been taken would have an effect.</p> <p>The conflict in Afghanistan has led to the deaths of 427 British soldiers, and more than 2,000 American troops. The United Nations said that 3,099 Afghan civilians were killed in the first six months of this year alone.</p> <p>Hammond insisted that it had been right to set an end-date to the military campaign because if \"you don't set a deadline you'll never get the job done\".</p> <p>While critics of the Afghan conflict have focused on the never-ending fighting with an insurgency that is weakened, but by no means defeated, and the corruption scandals that have plagued President Karzai's government, Hammond said the UK's involvement in Helmand would be regarded as a success story.</p> <p>\"The message for people back home is that over the years we have contained the threat to UK security, we have built the Afghan security forces to the point that they can take over that burden.</p> <p>\"We are confident we will leave in place a solution that will not look perfect \u2026 but if it maintains the integrity of Afghanistan and stops the use of it for international terrorists, we have achieved our primary purpose.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Even if we had achieved nothing lasting, every year that goes by keeping the bombers at bay, keeping them off our streets, is a significant achievement in itself. But we have clearly built the basics of a future that will deny the space of Afghanistan to those who would seek to harm us.\"</p>",
  "<p>Rejoice! A good company beats the odds in this deep recession. John Lewis the virtuous has leapt ahead with a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9751000/9751550.stm\" title=\"\">60%&#xa0;increase in profits</a>.

Its virtues and values are about to be tested, both in the mettle of its managers and in the honour of its employees.</p> <p>Twenty years ago, before the reign of Charlie Mayfield, the present CEO, the company's cleaners and caterers were all outsourced to save money. These 3,000 people share no bonuses and are excluded from the magic circle of John Lewis staff who enjoy not just the profits but all manner of sports clubs and leisure activities, thanks to the munificence of John Spedan Lewis, who&#xa0;gave away the company in 1929 in trust to its staff in perpetuity. His&#xa0;constitution says the partnership's ultimate purpose is \"the happiness of its&#xa0;members\". But in his day, cleaners were happy members.</p> <p>For two and half years now <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Citizens\" title=\"\">London Citizens</a> has been organising and campaigning on behalf of John Lewis cleaners as part of its living wage campaign for the low paid. Most are on \u00a36.08 an hour. The aim is to see them embraced back into the partnership with the same holiday, sick pay, pensions and staff discount as the other employees \u2013 and eventually to be paid the London living wage of \u00a38.30 \u2013 which even some full partners still don't earn.</p> <p>A union-organised strike by cleaners at the John Lewis Oxford Street store did get slightly better pay \u2013 but only for that one shop. The polite approach of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Citizens\" title=\"\">London Citizens</a> has so far yielded muffled responses, but the issue will be raised at a November board meeting: if there is no decisive yes, expect the gloves to come off, and more direct action, including a shoppers' boycott.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.johnlewispartnership.co.uk/about/our-constitution.html\" title=\"\">company's constitution</a> has management decisions presented as recommendations to the elected council of partners. What will they decide? Any partners who don't hear from cleaners' representatives could just stop and ask the cleaners on their own shop floor about their hardworking lives.</p> <p>Abraham is a cleaner, supervising 20 others who work for cleaning company <a href=\"http://www.integratedcleaningmanagement.com/\" title=\"\">ICM</a>, on \u00a36.08 an hour at a John Lewis store in London. He came from Nigeria 30 years ago, but like many others, and despite all his efforts, his aspirations were never fulfilled. He took the cleaning job to see him through night school where he passed all his law exams, but never found a foothold in the legal profession. \"I have a family, so I had to go back to cleaning at John Lewis. Many people I supervise are like me, accountants, teachers, printers, but this is all we can find.\" They hope to become partners and move up inside the company but, outsourced, they are outcast outsiders. \"This pay is not enough to put food on the table for many families. Many can't pay for their bus passes, so we pay for them and they repay us at the end of the week. We have no job security and hours are being cut. We want to join the John Lewis family.\"</p> <p>At a meeting of the cleaners this week, one of the partners who has worked on the shop floor at John Lewis for 30 years spoke up in their support. \"I'm passionate about John Lewis's values. But last year when we were gathered around with the razmatazz of unfolding the percentage bonus for the year, I caught the eye of a cleaner on the same floor: no bonus for them. I talk to them, and some are losing their homes due to cuts in working hours.\"</p> <p>But by no means all the partners will support their cause. One explained that some colleagues are more concerned that taking in another 3,000 partners will dilute the value of the bonus and perks paid to the existing 70,000. Others say they don't think the cleaners are worth the status of partnership. John Lewis is not a straightforward democracy: the constitution gives power to the management to make decisions then ratified by partners' representatives. But&#xa0;this is a straightforward ethical question. If the answer to the cleaners is no, the John Lewis brand will be permanently and rightly tarnished.</p> <p>There is nothing intrinsic about a mutual that makes it behave any better to those outside its gates than any other business. A mutual is better to work for if you belong, but not necessarily better behaved to those who don't. Ask the growing numbers of GPs or lawyers employed by partnerships to do their donkey-work but excluded from a partner's share in profits they help earn.</p> <p>What John Lewis decides matters far beyond the fate of these 3,000 cleaners. The government pretends to celebrate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jan/15/nick-clegg-john-lewis-economy\" title=\"\">\"the John Lewis model\"</a>, as it tries to outsource groups of public sector workers into social enterprises, selling their services back in. It hasn't been a notable success as yet: the Surrey nurses mutual <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog/2011/sep/19/social-enterprise-big-society-gets-reality-check\" title=\"\">received a \"big society award\" from David Cameron</a> but failed to win their first open contest for a contract.</p> <p>The praise for mutuals is just a fig leaf for the government's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/jul/11/open-public-services-white-paper-expectations\" title=\"\">open public services</a> plan to contract out everything, now gathering pace and alarmingly under-reported. A \u00a3300m NHS contract was quietly outsourced this week, for work at three major London hospitals. It's not popular. Research by the Fabian Society this week found 64% of voters saying \"services like health and education should not be run as businesses. They depend on the values and ethos of the public good\", with only 17% against and swing voters strongly pro-public service.</p> <p>If the John Lewis partners want to&#xa0;know if they get better value by outsourcing and underpaying cleaners, <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0297.2012.2533.x/abstract\" title=\"\">studies in the Economic Journal</a> suggest&#xa0;that the use of temporary, insecure workers results in declining productivity in many countries.</p> <p>John Lewis trades on its virtue, so here's a chance to become the beacon that stands against the outsourcing and undervaluing of staff, proving that it's not productive or necessary. The company's 60% profit announcement means there is no excuse for meanness from managers or partners, and every reason to bring their hard-pressed cleaners back in-house as full colleagues with the same opportunities. After two and a half years of prevarication and evasion, there's no excuse for ducking the issue in November. Never knowingly undersold is a weak motto unless it includes never knowingly underpaying a workforce.</p>",
  "<p>BAE Systems must prove that a $48bn (\u00a330bn) merger with EADS defends British interests and jobs before receiving the go-ahead from the government, the defence secretary has warned.</p> <p>Speaking in Afghanistan, Philip Hammond indicated the state would uphold its rights under a \"golden share\" in Britain's largest defence contractor and demand assurances that teaming up with the owner of Airbus will benefit the national economy and not compromise security.</p> <p>\"The British government will have to be satisfied that this is in the UK's national interest, because we have a special share in BAE systems,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We will want to be reassured not just about the security implications but about the implications for the future allocation of work to the UK. It's not just military work but Airbus work.\"</p> <p>Hammond's comments echoed those of trade unions and MPs, who have asked BAE Systems and EADS to ringfence about 52,000 British manufacturing and engineering jobs from any redundancy schemes after announcing plans to create an industrial powerhouse. In Britain it would range from construction of the British nuclear submarine fleet in Barrow-in-Furness to the building of Airbus A380 wings in Broughton, north Wales, and aircraft carriers in Portsmouth.</p> <p>Sources close to the deal stressed that the logic of the transaction is not driven by redundancy-funded cost savings, but the threat of job losses has emerged as a point of contention as well as the political implications of a deal that cannot proceed without the blessing of governments including those of the UK, France and Germany.</p> <p>Despite the concerns on security and jobs, Hammond indicated that the government supports the merger, with both companies working to a deadline of 10 October to thrash out a deal.</p> <p>\"We are not luddites,\" said the defence secretary. \"We recognise that BAE Systems has big challenges in a marketplace where most of the customers are reducing defence budgets. So sticking our heads in the sand and saying we would rather things just carry on as they were is not necessarily a very realistic response. We have to engage with the realities that the company faces and one of those realities is that our budget is smaller, the US, French, German, everyone's budget will be smaller and the company has to respond to that.\"</p> <p>Tony Burke, assistant general secretary of the Unite trade union, which represents 20,000 of BAE's 35,000 UK employees, said he was appalled by the lack of consultation with the workforce before the merger announcement.</p> <p>He said unions would use Brussels legislation to press for a full study of the social and economic implications of the deal.</p> <p>Asked about reassurances from sources close to the transaction that it would be positive for UK jobs and was \"not about redundancies\", Burke said: \"We have heard that one before. I have dealt with mergers going back many years and, based on those experiences, we will have to take that with a pinch of salt.\" BAE has already shed thousands of jobs following the government's strategic defence review.</p> <p>The Prospect union, which has 700 members in BAE's shipbuilding and munitions units, said it was concerned that EADS and its Airbus civil aerospace arm would dominate the enlarged group while allowing specific areas of BAE's manufacturing base to atrophy.</p> <p>\"It suggests that they might pull out of or divest themselves of other parts of the business,\" said Steve Jary, Prospect's national secretary.</p> <p>Sources close to the deal said unions should support the combination. \"This is about big, long-term, hi-tech industry. This is actually growing the future of advanced manufacturing in the UK,\" said one source.</p> <p>Without giving direct assurances on jobs, both firms have stressed the complementary nature of their businesses, with BAE focusing on defence and EADS on civil aerospace. Nonetheless, MPs added to the calls for reassurances on BAE, the UK's largest manufacturing employer.</p> <p>Mark Menzies, Tory MP for the Fylde constituency in Lancashire, base for BAE's military jet operations, which employs thousands, said: \"In the event of this merger going ahead, I want to ensure that the military air division of the company retains its headquarters in Warton.\"</p> <p>Lagard\u00e8re, a significant shareholder in EADS, said on Thursday that it would examine closely any tie-up before accepting a deal. The French media and aerospace group owns a 7.5% stake in EADS, with the French state bringing total Gallic ownership to 22.35%.</p> <p>Lagard\u00e8re said: \"The Lagard\u00e8re group intends to ensure that all consequences associated with the proposed EADS NV-BAE Systems plc merger are taken into consideration in determining the terms and conditions of the proposed transaction before it consents to the deal.\"</p> <p>The Lagard\u00e8re holding in EADS is part of a pact designed to maintain the balance between the company's French and German shareholders. The German carmaker Daimler holds 22.35% but is in the process of selling part of its holding to a state-backed bank.</p> <p>Edmund Salvesen, an analyst at Brewin Dolphin, said the reaction of the US government should be the companies' main concern. The Pentagon is BAE's biggest customer and buys the company's Bradley armoured vehicles, with BAE also involved in the construction of the F-35 joint strike fighter, a US government-led project.</p> <p>\"Whatever arrangements there are, these will need to address US sensitivities about technology transfer, which has become a major concern over the years, especially regarding the transfer of intellectual property.\"</p>",
  "<p>Kelvin Mackenzie claims he had no reason to disbelieve the police account of events on 15 April 1989 (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-disaster-mackenzie-profuse-apologies-sun?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">'The lies'</a>, 13 September). Yet it was only four years before, in August 1985, that the prosecution at Sheffield crown court decided, after over 50 days of the prosecution case, to abandon the trial of 71 miners charged with riot and a further 24 charged with violent disorder over the demonstration at the Orgreave coking plant in June 1984. I was part of the defence team and the evidence we gathered for that trial showed clearly that the South Yorkshire police, then as at Hillsborough under the command of chief constable Peter Wright, had compiled a case built on dishonest and misleading foundations, including mass-production of officers' statements and lies about what officers had seen. Over \u00a3500,000 was paid in total to the wrongly arrested miners by way of compensation, but not a single police officer was disciplined, never mind charged with perjury.</p> <p>The parallels with Hillsborough were obvious, even down to the denigration of the miners by Wright, Margaret Thatcher and much of the media. Yesterday's mealy-mouthed \"apology\" from the Sun pleading naive innocence is typically cynical.<br><strong>Michael McColgan</strong><br><em>Solicitor, Sheffield</em></p> <p>\u2022 Agreeing with Jack Straw does not come easily, but he is correct \u2013 the South Yorkshire police developed their sense of impunity under Thatcher during the miner's strike. Testimony at the Orgreave trial from the then assistant chief constable of South Yorkshire, Anthony Clements, typified the sense of inviolability. His claims of extreme violence by strikers were used as the reason for mounted police to charge the strikers. Lead defence barrister, Michael Mansfield (now acting for the Hillsborough Family Support Group) was able to produce a video with time-code shot by the police themselves on that day and juxtaposed Mr Clements' testimony to the reality. It was a fabrication almost in its entirety.</p> <p>Our (Vanson Wardle Productions) film <a href=\"http://www.yvettevanson.com/film-clips.php\" title=\"\">The Battle for Orgreave</a> for C4, detailed every false allegation against the defendants and provided documentary and independent eyewitness evidence to prove their falsity \u2013 evidence that would have been presented in court by the defence had the trial ever got that far. This damning evidence raised not a single official eyebrow. My own book (of the same name) went into even greater detail and still there was no response from government. Is there any wonder that, four years later when Hillsborough happened, this same police force used similar tactics to absolve itself of responsibility and portray the victims as the perpetrators? <br><strong>Tony Wardle</strong><br><em>Bristol</em></p> <p>\u2022 It's a shame so little will happen to those who created the climate for the Hillsborough cover-up. The Thatcher government, aided and abetted by the Sun, created a climate where the police force became the tool to break the back of the unions. When people believe they are above the law, when they believe they are doing their masters' bidding, then you get a cover-up of the staggering breadth and depth of this one. Thatcher let slip the dogs of war, Liverpool paid the price.<br><strong>Jon Phillips</strong><br><em>Torrance, California, USA</em></p> <p>\u2022 Tory government, dodgy coppers, Murdoch press?

  "<p>As final negotiations over the future of the Olympic Stadium enter a crucial stage, the West Ham United vice-chair, Karren Brady, has insisted that the club's proposal will deliver a lasting legacy.</p> <p>Boris Johnson this week took personal control of the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC), moving the chairman, Daniel Moylan, to a new role chairing an aviation review after less than four months in the job. One of the mayor's most pressing tasks will be to try to strike a deal with West Ham amid protracted negotiations over the terms of any tenancy deal. On top of the \u00a395m in public money already pledged to convert the stadium into a permanent venue with a full roof and hospitality facilities, the east London club are believed to want the LLDC to contribute towards retractable seating and other costs.</p> <p>Brady will make the argument that by handing the main tenancy to a Premier League football club, it will bring benefits to the Olympic Park and wider area&#xa0;above and beyond its rental contribution, including enhancing the value of naming rights and helping make it a popular destination.</p> <p>\"I noted with interest Lord Coe's comments on Sunday about his desire to find a workable solution where athletics and other sports can operate together side-by-side,\" Brady said. \"His comments instantly struck a chord with me, as I firmly believe that our proposal will ensure that his vision would become a reality should we be given the opportunity to do so.\"</p> <p>It is understood that Johnson is keen to conclude a deal and anxious to avoid any potential delay in reopening the park from July next year onwards. But the LLDC's interim chief executive, Dennis Hone, will be keen to ensure that the figures add up and some on the board believe the success of the Olympics, which proved the stadium will work as an athletics and music venue, have strengthened their negotiating hand with West Ham.</p> <p>\"In addition to bringing the most exciting and most watched football league in the world to Stratford, we would ensure that the stadium retains the Olympic legacy that Lord Coe feels so passionately about,\" Brady argued. \"The truly multi\u2011sport capabilities of the arena would mean our award-winning community sports trust, which already helps tens of thousands of children a year, can further extend its multi-sports coaching to the next generation of potential Olympic&#xa0;athletes.\"</p> <p>The saga of the future of the \u00a3468m stadium has been long and drawn out, punctuated by missed opportunities, legal battles and expensive mistakes. The original deal with West Ham had to be scrapped amid legal challenges from Tottenham Hotspur and Leyton Orient.</p> <p>But Coe said at the close of the Games that it remained \"perfectly within the wit and wisdom of all of us to make a multi-purpose sporting arena work for track and field\". The LLDC hopes to reopen the south end of the park, including the stadium, by spring 2014.</p> <p>Brady said that West Ham's bid would also help further the legacy aims of the LLDC and the government.</p> <p>\"Our bid revolves around creating a sporting hub that the community of east London and beyond can use to better themselves; whether that be through sport, education or simply living a healthier lifestyle,\" she said.</p> <p>\"We have all watched in wonder at the historic scenes created in the Olympic Stadium and I believe it would now be unthinkable to not maintain this new global landmark as a stunning, world-class sporting venue that can inspire hundreds of thousands of people through the power of sport.\"</p>",
  "<p>Premiership Rugby and the unions which organise the Heineken Cup may end up in court as the battle for control of European rugby's leading club competition intensifies in the biggest schism in six nations rugby for 14 years.</p> <p>A TV deal with BT Vision announced by Premiership Rugby this week, which included rights to European competition, provoked a war of words with European Rugby Cup Ltd, the organisers of the Heineken and Amlin Challenge Cups, with each side accusing the other of selling the rights to a tournament that did not exist.</p> <p>Premiership Rugby's TV deal and desire to change the format of the Heineken Cup are the ostensible reasons for the dispute. ERC maintains that International Rugby Board regulations do not allow clubs to negotiate television or sponsorship contracts unless their union gives them permission, and then it only applies to competitions played within their own borders. It was taking legal advice.</p> <p>The English clubs, who boycotted Europe in 1998 in a dispute over who controlled the professional game, insist under the terms of an agreement with the Rugby Football Union five years ago they have the right to do their own TV deals. That deal ends in 2016, two years before the contract with BT Vision concludes, something that could be rendered invalid if the RFU took back the negotiation rights.</p> <p>ERC has agreed an enhanced TV deal with Sky for the Heineken Cup to run to 2018, something Premiership Rugby which, with the leading French clubs, last June served a two-year notice for pulling out of the European tournaments, says is invalid because, with a new participation agreement to replace the one that ends in 2014 not agreed, there is nothing to sell. \"What this is about is club competitions being run by clubs rather than the unions,\" said a Premiership source. \"The Champions League is not run by the Football Association or the German federation and imagine how stupid it would be if it were. It is in everyone's interests to play together with a more even distribution of money than is currently the case.It comes down to who blinks first.\"</p> <p>The English and French clubs say the only way to get meaningful change is to make a lot of noise, and by securing money for a European competition from BT Vision, whose chief executive Marc Watson predicted a new European competition with a \"fantastic new format\u201a\" would replace the Heineken Cup, they have the financial means to divide the other four countries that make up the ERC board, Wales, Ireland, Scotland and Italy.</p> <p>ERC's stance is that Premiership Rugby is bound by corporate governance to the new Sky deal because it was part of a meeting on 6 June, as one of England's two representatives, that mandated the executive to conclude the agreement. The English clubs response is that three weeks later, on 27 June, they wrote to ERC, copying in Sky, saying the contract was invalid.</p> <p>\"The Heineken Cup is a tremendous tournament but the terms have to be tweaked,\" said the Saracens chairman, Nigel Wray. \"English and French clubs have to knock each other out to get into the tournament and all the other guys stroll in. That's not right given that we provide most of the revenue. The Heineken Cup was set up by the unions and fair play to them, but the clubs in England and France must get their reward.\"</p> <p>The ERC board meets on Tuesday in Dublinnext week to discuss a new participation agreement. England's two directors are Leicester's Peter Wheeler and the RFU's Rob Andrew. Other unions are looking to Twickenham to exert their authority over the clubs and emphasise that TV rights for cross-border regulations are not for clubs to sell under the IRB's regulation 13. The IRB can only become involved if a union makes a complaint.</p> <p>The RFU's chief executive, Ian Ritchie, and the Premiership Rugby chief executive, Mark McCafferty, attended a meeting of the professional game board at Twickenhamon Thursday . Entry criteria for the Premiership was meant to be the main subject on the agenda, but the conflict in Europe dominated debate. The RFU did not give away its stance. \"We are exploring the legalities around the relevant section of the agreement between PRL [Premiership Rugby] and the RFU in 2007,\" said a Union spokesperson. \"We will continue to talk with all parties on what is a complex and fast moving set of issues, in a confidential manner. We will consider and reflect upon the situation before commenting further.\"</p>",
  "<p>No British government ever wishes to be seen as soft on immigration. That's particularly true of a government that is trailing consistently badly <a href=\"http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/tkdi1n6ngn/YG-Archives-Pol-Sun-results-120912.pdf\" title=\"\">in the opinion polls</a> and whose reputation on immigration is one of <a href=\"http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/yqhb16pj0b/YG-Archives-Pol-Trackers-Issues1-210812.pdf\" title=\"\">its few remaining strong suits with the voters</a> \u2013 both of which are true of David Cameron's government. This basic \u2013 and base \u2013 political calculation provides the background explanation for \u2013 even if it does not excuse \u2013 the coalition government's general determination to slash <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jun/13/foreign-student-visa-numbers-cut\" title=\"\">student visa numbers</a> and its specific preference for a zero tolerance approach towards the 2,700 overseas students caught by last month's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/31/foreign-students-editorial\" title=\"\">sudden ban on the teaching of non-EU foreign students by London Metropolitan University</a>. The callous treatment of those students is a disgrace both to the government and, more worryingly, to Britain's wider reputation as a world-class university destination.</p> <p>It is no secret that both the general issue of student visas and the specific one about LMU have caused major rows within the government. In both cases, the business department has been pitted against the Home Office, and in both cases, the Home Office has prevailed. On Thursday, however, the business department announced a more sensible and less fear-driven long-term approach to overseas student numbers. As a result, perhaps some good may come from last month's bad decision over LMU, though that may be little consolation to those caught up in the consequences.</p> <p>Both <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/speeches\" title=\"\">the business secretary Vince Cable and the universities minister David Willetts</a> have addressed this week's Universities UK conference at Keele University, and both have tried to strike a more positive note. Both have a difficult task. The international reputational damage caused by the LMU ban and its consequences for the universities are very bad. This has been particularly serious in both India and China, where the distinction between LMU and London University is not always understood. As a result, the impression that foreign students are unwelcome in London as a whole has been particularly damaging, just at the time when the Olympics have done so much to make the capital so attractive.</p> <p>The damage is not just reputational but financial. Foreign students pay average fees of about \u00a310,000 a year and spend at least that amount while they are here. They bring in almost \u00a38bn a year to the UK. A large cut in foreign student numbers would not just be damaging to the finances of Britain's universities. Almost all rely on a significant income from overseas fees. A cut would increase the financial pressure on home-grown students too, as the colleges struggled to offset their loss of overseas income. Be clear also that cutting foreign students makes this country more boring, more insular and more ignorant \u2014 as Mr Willetts himself said.</p> <p>This is a big public issue. Encouragingly, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-19579923\" title=\"\">Mr Willetts told the university heads something they wanted to hear</a>: that the government wants to \u2013 wants to, note, not will \u2013 publish disaggregated immigration statistics that make clear the difference between students entering and leaving the UK for legitimate educational reasons, and other categories of migrants. This may seem a dry proposal at first sight. But it could pave the way for a more informed debate and, better still, for a clearer differentiation that may safeguard universities and their legitimate students. Labour should back Mr Willetts on this.</p> <p>That foreign students should have proper visas, should attend proper courses in proper colleges, should speak decent English and obey the terms of their immigration status ought to be common ground. But so should the principle that Britain and its universities should be able to recruit students on merit. The LMU debacle has been a miserable episode and much remains to be done to help LMU's foreign students and protect the reputation of foreign student programmes here more generally. But there was some hope on Thursday that, having lost a battle, the business department may eventually win the war.</p>",
  "<p>My heart sank. Not&#xa0;another gargantuan report on another debacle in the state's guardianship of the public realm. Not&#xa0;hundreds more witnesses, thousands more pages and millions more pounds on lawyers, all to a chorus of righteous outrage from that proxy of postmodern democracy, the public inquiry.</p> <p>Then I read the report itself, on the 1989 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/hillsborough-disaster\" title=\"\">Hillsborough disaster</a>. We knew the half of it. An inquest followed by two judicial inquiries had already related what happened that fatal Sheffield afternoon when 96 people died after going to a football match. This report tells us far more. It tells us what happened next: the cover-up, the lies, the botched inquiries, and the attempts to make amends. It is a grim textbook in modern British government.</p> <p>The panel that produced it is described as \"independent\". But were the original coroner and divisional appeal judge not independent, or the inquiries by Lord Justice Taylor (1990) and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith (1998)? What of the Home Office and its boss, Jack Straw, who concluded on receiving Stuart-Smith that, \"there is no basis for a further public inquiry \u2026 for a renewed application to quash the verdict of the inquest\"? And what of parliament, which agreed with him?</p> <p>This new panel was set up entirely as a result of campaigning by the bereaved families. It was conducted not by a judge but by the bishop of Liverpool, helped by a diverse group of academics and journalists. It did not proceed \"judicially\" but by investigation. It did not hold grand hearings, like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/leveson-inquiry\" title=\"\">Lord Justice Leveson</a>, with highly paid lawyers and star witnesses showing off before cameras. It dug into archives, examined documents, respected privacy, met and talked to individuals. It was exemplary.</p> <p>Yet even this report pulls punches. It reveals the conduct of the South Yorkshire police but does not delve into the causes of its culture of conspiracy and deceit. It did not trespass on the apparent immunity of the police service to wider accountability. Nor did it discuss the failure of coroners, judges, politicians and home secretaries to respond to the clearly justified pleas of the victims' families. The scandal is not just what happened at Hillsborough. For its negligence and incompetence, it was an accident. The scandal is the passage of 23 years since then, which was deliberate. That clearly needs further action.</p> <p>The impression of Hillsborough is of government not as a rational process but as a series of lurches between disaster and response. The country seems to have reverted to pre-parliamentary days, when the lord chancellor and judges alone ruled the land from the king's bench. It is a historic irony that this time the judges have been taught a lesson, not by anyone elected but by one of their&#xa0;medieval confreres, a bishop.</p> <p>Inquiries are gradually lifting responsibility for errors of government from the shoulders of ministers. They anaesthetise responsibility and hand it back detoxified. Politics has found a way of shifting, delaying and diluting blame. It happened over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/bloodysunday\" title=\"\">Bloody Sunday</a>, arms-for-Iraq, the death of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/david-kelly\" title=\"\">David Kelly</a>, the Potters Bar and Ladbroke Grove rail crashes, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/shipman\" title=\"\">the Shipman murders</a>, phone-hacking, childcare deaths and urban riots. It is even happening over airports.</p> <p>The outcome is either no action, as government goes inert for the duration, or a later kneejerk overreaction. Every health service tragedy means an inquiry and then a torrent of Whitehall risk aversion, form filling and bureaucracy. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/soham\" title=\"\">Soham murders</a> led to a fifth of all adults reportedly in need of criminal record checks. The high costs (and thus high fares) of trains has been attributed to the 91 recommendations of the Hidden report on the 1988 Clapham rail crash.</p> <p>The Hillsborough report should lead to a reform of coroners courts, which, like other courts, seem immune to criticism or self-discipline. That a coroner could declare \"everyone dead\" at 3.15 on the fatal afternoon was bizarre enough, but that a divisional court declined to overrule it was more so. Two senior judges then&#xa0;blinded themselves to police malpractice, as if that were a contradiction in terms. But will anything change? In Britain's adversarial justice system, there is no lobby for the truth.</p> <p>Whenever these scandals erupt, those in charge always claim that \"lessons have been learned\" and things have moved on. Yet the same defensive arrogance as was shown by the South Yorkshire police was apparent over the deaths of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/g20-police-assault-ian-tomlinson\" title=\"\">Ian Tomlinson</a> in the G20 riots in 2009, and of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/mark-duggan\" title=\"\">Mark Duggan</a> before the 2011 riots. Control of the police service is now so centralised that it answers only to the home secretary, which means to no one. The police in England and Wales are effectively privatised to the Police Federation.</p> <p>The coalition wants to meet this challenge with elected police commissioners. The ambition is commendable. Accountability for police performance must \"bite\" somewhere. Nor should this refer only to policy. Police lobbyists cannot demand protection for \"operational decisions\". What else is accountability for if not to explain the handling of Hillsborough or the riots? Whether commissioners are the way to deliver this is moot. Why cities should be forced to elect police commissioners but not mayors is a mystery. In most countries civic government, like national government, falls to an all-purpose democratic authority. Tony Blair's similar bid to \"elect\" his 2002 foundation hospital trusts was a fiasco of non-participation, and led to swift \"producer capture\", as did the Inner London Education Authority.</p> <p>But any democracy is better than none. A Sheffield police commissioner would have at least some local case to answer after Hillsborough. Instead, accountability has been rendered by two judges, a bishop and a prime minister, whose \"apology\" for something that is nothing to do with him is meaningless.</p>",
  "<p>It's 8.30 on a grey morning in Belfast and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/jamescameron\" title=\"\">James Cameron</a>, never a fan of the small gesture, strides into the recently opened Titanic Belfast museum to the swelling strains of <em>that</em> Celine Dion song. Despite having landed about 12 hours ago, Cameron, a good-looking 58-year-old with a powder-puff moustache and beard, is full of beans, eager to wring yet more drops out of the waterlogged wreck of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic\" title=\"\">RMS Titanic</a>.</p> <p>The ostensible reason Cameron has flown to the other side of the world from his homes in California and New Zealand is to promote the 3D Blu-Ray disc of his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/35417/titanic\" title=\"\">world-swallowing multi-Oscar-winning 1997 film</a>. But the real reason is that this is simply the kind of thing that he does. Cameron will happily travel anywhere to expound upon his three great passions: marine and space exploration, and technology. When we meet after the press conference he tells me repeatedly that the only reason he made <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/35417/titanic\" title=\"\">Titanic</a> was so a film studio would pay for him to go on deep-sea dives to see the wreckage: \"Anything I had to do after that was just part of the deal, I make no bones about that.\" He seizes the opportunity of the early-morning press conference to announce proudly that three years ago he commissioned a study with the US naval academy to learn more about the sinking of the Titanic, out of plain curiosity. In the years between Titanic and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/131170/avatar\" title=\"\">Avatar</a> he became a proficient deep-sea diver and earlier this year he was the first to make a solo dive to the deepest part of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/mar/26/mariana-trench-james-cameron-mission\" title=\"\">Mariana Trench</a>.</p> <p>When I ask if he ever just chills out, he protests that of course he loves his downtime with his family: \"But we'll usually jet-ski all together or do something like that.\" He and the presumably very energetic current Mrs Cameron \u2013 <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0000751/\" title=\"\">Suzy Amis</a>, who appears briefly in Titanic \u2013 have been married for 12 years and it is by far the longest of his five marriages. \"I've probably mellowed out,\" he says simply.</p> <p>Well, it is all relative, but it is perhaps not surprising that he has been married five times as he only seems to deal in big numbers: it has been decades since he has made a film that wasn't described as \"the most expensive ever made\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0096754/\" title=\"\">The Abyss</a> was the first to be awarded that honour, then <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/77483/terminator.2.-.judgment.day\" title=\"\">Terminator 2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111503/\" title=\"\">True Lies</a>, Titanic <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/27/movies/awardsseason/27record.html\" title=\"\">and finally Avatar</a> \u2013 and the takings have nearly always justified the budget. At a conservative estimate, Cameron's movies have made more than $7bn and Titanic and Avatar are the two biggest-grossing films ever. The costs are largely due to his determination to make his fantasies a reality.</p> <p>As a child Cameron fell in love with marine exploration, seeing it as a more accessible form of space exploration. When he saw the underwater technology that had been developed to explore the wreck of the Titanic in the 80s, he thought: \"I've got to get me some of that.\" His love of special effects marries his love of art and science and I can still remember the gasping thrill of seeing the liquid metal in Terminator 2 at the cinema for the first time.</p> <p>Cameron can be a fantastic storyteller: no matter how much you roll your eyes watching it, Titanic is as irresistible as the suction of a sinking ship. But his love of effects risks distracting his attention from the storyline, and it is not really an accusation that he does much to refute. During the morning press conference, when asked what his favourite scene from Titanic is, he replies, \"when Rose and Jack first kiss,\" which seems a surprisingly sentimental choice for him but then he adds: \"Not for the emotionality, but the way we shot it.\" Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet asked him how they should kiss, \"and so I drew some lips here,\" he says, pointing to the knuckles on his thumbs and beginning to knock them together, \"and said: 'Like this.'\" And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how you win a best director Oscar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396114572\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347551613726/Avatar-Camerons-space-cow-010.jpg\" alt=\"Avatar: Cameron's space cowboy blockbuster.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Avatar: Cameron's space cowboy blockbuster. Photograph: 20th Century Fox</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Avatar is the most obvious example of Cameron's interest in technology taking precedence over plot and it is astonishing to think that he is about to start shooting Avatars 2, 3 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/10/avatar-4-prequel-james-cameron\" title=\"\">and maybe even 4</a> when there was barely enough script for Avatar 1, and what there was flirted with condescending colonialism.</p> <p>After the press conference, I meet Cameron upstairs looking out over the dock where the Titanic set sail for Southampton a century ago. In person he is charm itself, talkative and open, and looking healthier than he did 10 years ago, doubtless thanks to his \"gradual conversion\" to a vegan diet, primarily for environmental reasons. Only occasionally are there the flashes of the legendary impatience, the first one coming when I refer to an infamous incident in which he kicked over a tea cart because he was so outraged the film crew took a break.</p> <p>\"That was years ago! Hello?!\" he shouts and it briefly looks as if I might be the next tea cart. But the storm passes as swiftly as it erupted: \"Look, there's an aspect of movie-making that rewards bad behaviour. You're working with a team of people and you tell them what you want and a few weeks later they've forgetten everything. So you scream at them and somehow they remember. Not my actors, though \u2013 I've always been very circumspect with them.\"</p> <p>This is somewhat debatable. While some, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sigourney Weaver and Bill Paxton, have worked with him repeatedly, others couldn't get away fast enough. Winslet said Cameron \"has a temper like you wouldn't believe\" and she would never work with him again \"unless it was for a lot of money\".</p> <p>But, he avows, he's a changed man. The underwater expeditions he has done in the past decade have \"taught me about good leadership because now I know if someone hasn't done their job properly, I haven't done mine because I haven't communicated to them what I want\".</p> <p>Not that he has entirely mellowed. When I ask if it's true he wanted to buy the rights to Michael Crichton's book Jurassic Park, just the memory of how Steven Spielberg beat him to it by mere hours sparks hissing frustration: \"That motherfucker!\"</p> <p>While Cameron is known now for spending as much on films as small countries spend on their military, he in fact started out with small budgets. After a happy childhood in Canada and then dropping out of college, he decided on film-making after seeing Star Wars and he found work at the low-budget Roger Corman studios. From there, he got an ill-fated job as the director of Piranha II and then, after coming up with the story in a feverish dream, he wrote Terminator.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396114573\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347551774854/Into-the-deep-Titanic.-In-010.jpg\" alt=\"Into the deep: Titanic.

Photograph: Image Net</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image Net</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite his displays of machismo Cameron has written some of the best roles for women in cinema. \"I didn't even think it was that remarkable when I did it with Terminator \u2013 it's remarkable by its absence in other Hollywood movies,\" he shrugs. \"I do think Hollywood movies get it wrong when they show women in action roles \u2013 they basically make them men. Or else they make them into superheroes in shiny black suits, which is just not as interesting.\"</p> <p>You seem to enjoy writing roles for strong women, I say.</p> <p>\"Absolutely. To me, it's just another challenge. It doesn't matter to me if it's an engineering challenge, a scientific challenge, a writing challenge \u2013 for a man to write a woman and make her interesting to women as well as men, it's a challenge. Maybe it's just a quest to understand women who are sometimes inscrutable,\" he says.</p> <p>As well as writing strong women he seems to enjoy marrying them. His roster of ex-wives includes Terminator's <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0000157/\" title=\"\">Linda Hamilton</a>, film producer <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0005036/\" title=\"\">Gale Anne Hurd</a> and the director <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/kathryn-bigelow\" title=\"\">Kathryn Bigelow</a>, with whom he remains good friends <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/mar/08/oscars-2010-hurt-locker-avatar\" title=\"\">despite losing out to her for the 2009 directing Oscar</a>.</p> <p>These days, he, his wife and his five children \u2013 aged between 23 and five \u2013 live in both New Zealand and Los Angeles after Cameron decided he didn't want his children to grow up solely in LA: \"I didn't want to raise them in that poisonous atmosphere. There's a climate of materialism in Los Angeles. We're all vegan, we grow our own organic food at our ranch in California, and we'll continue to do that in New Zealand. You want your kids to grow up with a certain set of values.\"</p> <p>As part of that endeavour, he threw out the family's television sets but does allow the kids to watch movies, yet only as a family group, with everyone voting for which film to watch: \"It teaches them conflict resolution. It's like the old days when everybody lived in one room in a cabin.\" Albeit a one-room cabin that reportedly cost $16m and is set on 2,500 acres of prime New Zealand land. \"Oh, come on! There are ranches in Montana that are 100,000 acres!\" he scoffs.</p> <p>So seeing as Cameron is no longer beset by his ego and temper maybe I can ask him the question that's been bugging me for the past 15 years.</p> <p>\"Sure,\" he says.</p> <p>Couldn't Rose have shared her wooden board with Jack at the end of Titanic instead of shoving him into the ocean? \"Wait a minute, I'm going to call up William Shakespeare and ask why Romeo and Juliet had to die,\" he snaps.</p> <p>Ah, that's better.</p> <p><em>Hadley Freeman flew courtesy of </em><a href=\"http://www.discoverireland.com/us/\" title=\"\"><em>www.discoverireland.com</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Greg Barker, the climate change minister, personally asked the Environment Agency (EA) about a permit application being submitted by a US energy company that was also paying one of his departmental advisers as a consultant, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/11/climate-change-minister-links-adviser\" title=\"\">Emails released under freedom of information legislation</a> show that Miriam Maes, a paid \"delivery adviser\" at the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) who was also acting at the same time as a consultant to the US energy firm Air Products, helped to engineer a meeting between Barker and Air Products the day before the minister went to visit the Environment Agency for a regular \"update\".</p> <p>On 6 February 2011, Maes emailed Barker \u2013 without copying in a Decc official as she was meant to \u2013 requesting a meeting with \"one of my clients Air Products\". She added: \"I will send a formal request in through [redacted] but could you give it a gentle nudge if needed?\" She also forwarded Air Products' \"meeting objectives\", which included \"Highlights of Tees Valley Project\" and \"Path forward\".</p> <p>Less than an hour later, Barker replied: \"Of course, let's get it in the diary but let's have a chat rather than email.\" Maes replied: \"Ok understood!\" A meeting took place between Air Products, Barker, Maes and Decc officials on 1 March.</p> <p>At the meeting with the EA the following day, Barker asked about the permit application that Air Products needed, in addition to planning consent, to receive the green light to build the world's largest renewable energy plant on Teesside.</p> <p>Six weeks later Maes emailed Barker, again without copying in a Decc official, to say: \"Although it is a while ago, were you able to discuss the Air Products' situation with [redacted] from the Environmental Agency?\" Just under three hours later, Barker replied: \"I did!\"</p> <p>Asked by the Guardian if she had asked for Barker to personally inquire about the permit, Maes said: \"I absolutely never asked Greg Barker, ahead of his March 2nd 2011 meeting with the EA or any time before or after about Air Products' permit application for the Teesside plant.\"</p> <p>She also played down her relationship with another company, Salix, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/12/energy-minister-greg-barker-david-cameron\" title=\"\">secured a \u00a35m contract from Decc</a> and was listed on her website as part of a network of partners. \"The Decc officials had prepared as usual a ministerial briefing note prior to the meeting with Salix, including the recommendation [to award a contract],\" she said. \"I did not have any input into this briefing note prior to the meeting and was only asked to join the meeting with Salix at the last moment. When asked for my views in the meeting with Salix, I said that I agreed with the recommendation from the Decc officials.\"</p> <p>Both Maes and Salix insist no money changed hands between them. But the revelations about Air Products raise questions about the appropriateness of Barker's relationship with Maes and in particular his judgment in allowing Maes to pursue her consultancy client's interests while also being paid as a Decc adviser.</p> <p>Barker met Air Products three times in 2011, the company says, and featured at least twice in publicity photographs taken for the company. He also agreed to a positive quote, drafted by Air Products in his name and forwarded for his attention by Maes, to be used in an Air Products press release in August 2011, announcing that the Teesside plant had been granted planning permission. Maes emailed Barker, without copying in an official, on 10 August 2011 to say: \"Many thanks for accepting the quote!\"</p> <p>Labour has called on the prime minister to conduct a fresh investigation into the affair following revelations <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/11/climate-change-minister-links-adviser\" title=\"\">published in the Guardian this week</a>. On Wednesday, David Cameron said the cabinet secretary and Decc's permanent secretary had already looked into whether Maes was properly appointed as an adviser and concluded nothing was untoward. However, it is still unclear when this investigation took place, if it examined all the newly released emails or whether its remit included Barker's judgment in dealing with Maes, a former personal adviser to him before he became a minister in 2010.</p> <p>Asked by the Guardian to explain the Air Products \"situation\", referred to in Maes's email to Barker on 18 March 2011, an EA spokeswoman said: \"The EA's chief executive Paul Leinster and chairman Lord Smith meet with Decc ministers to update them on our frontline work, such as the administration of carbon trading schemes. At the meeting on 2 March, 2011, with Greg Barker we were asked a question about a proposed permit application by Air Products for a gasification plant on Teesside that aimed to use new technology. We provided factual information about the permitting process.\"</p> <p>The spokeswoman later confirmed that it was Barker asked EA the question. She said: \"The minister wanted clarification that the new gasification technology was understood in relation to the permitting process. We provided a factual update about the permitting process.\"</p> <p>She added that the permit was granted by the EA in April this year after a \"robust 11-month assessment in line with strict terms of the Waste Incineration Directive. The resulting permit sets limits on emissions and lays out reporting and monitoring requirements to ensure the environment and local community are protected.\"</p> <p>When it opens in 2014 on the site of a former ICI factory near Billingham, the 49MW energy-from-waste plant will provide power for up to 50,000 homes in the north-east by burning 350,000 metric tonnes of non-recyclable waste from landfill each year.</p> <p>People close to Barker defended his actions. The email from Barker suggesting that he and Maes should talk about Air Products rather than email was sent because Maes often sent several long emails: \"Barker could not see them on a BlackBerry and found it quicker to discuss issues instead to stop her filling up the inbox,\" said a person close to the minister.</p> <p>Barker had raised the Teesside project with the EA because he was worried its knowledge of the technology was \"out of date\". Sources close to the minister also defended Maes, saying: \"[She] was certainly the most qualified woman in the whole distributed energy field in London. We were extremely lucky to have her on board.\"In reference to Barker's offer to \"nudge\" officials about an invoice, Barker had not pressed officials to pay the money, only to make sure it was dealt with.</p> <p>An Air Products spokeswoman said: \"During the period February 2010 until November 2011, Air Products engaged Miriam Maes as a consultant to advise us on the UK energy market which included engagement with potential power purchasers in the UK. As part of this process, we met with Greg Barker in March 2011 following a formal meeting request to his private secretary. We had first established from Mrs Maes that there was no legal or ethical barrier to the minister being briefed on a new energy-from-waste technology within his ministerial portfolio. Further separate meetings were held with Mr Barker as part of his Green Trade Mission to the USA in March 2011, organised by UKTI and again at the Conservative Party Conference in October 2011.\"The spokeswoman added: \"The [first] meeting [with Barker] took place at 4pm on Tuesday, 1st March 2011 at which Greg Barker and Miriam Maes were present along with civil servants from Decc. The meeting was held at Decc's office on 3 Whitehall Place.\"</p> <p>A Decc spokesman said: \"The minister raised this concern during a routine meeting with the Environment Agency. It is part of his and the department's work to pursue issues raised by industry.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 14 September 2012. An editing error led the original to incorrectly refer to \"a permit application for a \u00a35bn contract being submitted by a US energy company\". An earlier version of this footnote pointed out that the figure of \u00a35bn was not the value of a contract but incorrectly said it was the value of the company, Air Products. In fact \u00a35bn was a rough approximation of the annual revenues generated by Air Products (actually $10.1bn, or about \u00a36.2bn). Further, we would like to clarify that there is no connection between the permit application submitted by Air Products and a \u00a35m contract between Salix and the Department for Energy and Climate Change, mentioned elsewhere in the story.</p>",
  "<p>The European Union must prepare itself for the breakup of countries within its frontiers, the regional prime minister of Catalonia warned on Thursday, adding that Madrid could not simply ignore a huge independence demonstration held in Barcelona this week.</p> <p>Artur Mas said: \"Europe will at some time have to think about this. It wouldn't make sense if, because of some rigid norms, it was unable to adapt to changing realities.\"</p> <p>His comments came after the European commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, indicated this week that any new state would have to apply to join the EU.</p> <p>Mas said there would be no looking back for Catalonia after the march, which police said was attended by 1.5 million people \u2013 a fifth of the population of the north-eastern region. He also warned the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, and his conservative People's party (PP) government that they would be foolish to try to ignore the apparent desire for greater autonomy.</p> <p>\"This was not a sudden summer fever,\" he said. \"In Barcelona there was a vast, peaceful multitude of people \u2026 The biggest possible mistake would be to minimise what is happening.</p> <p>\"It was very important both quantitatively and qualitatively. The feeling was that Catalonia cannot continue on the current path, that it needs its own project.\"</p> <p>His words came as the state television company, TVE, apologised for relegating the demonstration to fifth place in its evening news, a move that underlined the growing disconnection between Madrid and Barcelona. \"This news item was poorly placed on the evening news,\" a spokesman admitted. \"That was an error.\"</p> <p>Mas, from the Catalan nationalist Convergence and Union coalition, suggested that independence was not the only solution. Many members of his regional government were at the march and his party is often accused of calculated ambiguity on the matter.</p> <p>\"I identify with the popular outcry,\" he said, adding that only his responsibilities as regional prime minister had prevented him from joining the demonstrators. \"Catalonia needs a state,\" he added. \"For years we thought it could be the Spanish state.\"</p> <p>But just as northern Europe was getting fed up with the south, and vice versa, so Catalonia and the rest of Spain were now fed up with one another, Mas said.</p> <p>He implied that one way for Rajoy to dampen the surge in separatist feeling would be to agree to a change in funding, allowing Spain's wealthiest region to hold on to more of the tax it generates.</p> <p>Catalonia wants to be able to collect its own taxes and send a share to Madrid, rather than the other way around. That would make it different from most of Spain's other 16 regional government, but similar to the northern Basque country.</p> <p>Mas will see Rajoy next week to discuss what he called an issue of \"fiscal sovereignty\". Popular outrage at Catalan money going elsewhere amid health and education cuts was fuelling the thirst for independence, he suggested.</p> <p>Mas said that whatever changes came after this week's demonstration, Catalans wanted to stay in the EU and the euro. \"We haven't gone mad,\" he said.</p> <p>Catalonia enjoys a high degree of self-government, running health, education and local policing, but allowing it to form a separate state would be both extremely difficult and potentially explosive. A legal separation would require a change in the Spanish constitution and approval by voters in other parts of the country in a referendum \u2013 which seems unlikely.</p> <p>\"Unilateral secession does not fit in Spain's constitutional framework,\" foreign minister Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garcia-Margallo declared on Thursday. \"A declaration of independence by a region does not fit.\"</p> <p>Officials in Brussels have also said that Catalonia would automatically leave the EU, and might have to abandon the euro and print its own currency.</p> <p>\"A new state, if it wants to join the European Union, has to apply to become a member like any state,\" Barroso said this week. \"And all the other member states have to give their consent.\"</p> <p>Garcia-Margallo warned that Catalonia or any other Spanish region that achieved independence would find itself at \"the back of the queue\" for joining the EU.</p> <p>The independence demonstration sets a further challenge for Rajoy as he copes with 25% unemployment and a double-dip recession, and decides whether to request a bailout by the European Central Bank and fellow eurozone countries.</p> <p>\"Catalonia has serious deficit and employment problems and this is not the moment for messing around,\" Rajoy said before the demonstration.</p> <p>Mas's government has launched several austerity programmes as it struggles to bring down its deficit, and ratings agencies give its debt junk status.</p> <p>Economists doubt it will hit deficit targets set by the central government this year, however, and Rajoy's government \u2013 which is keen to persuade fellow eurozone countries it can control overspending regional governments \u2013 has threatened to intervene and take direct control of regional finances where that happens.</p> <p>Mas has threatened to call elections if that is done in Catalonia, believing it would provoke a wave of nationalist sentiment. Catalans pay between \u00a412bn and \u00a416bn more in taxes each year to Madrid than they receive back, with the excess going to poorer regions such as Andalusia and Extremadura.</p>",
  "<p>With its first iPhone, Apple let us take the web everywhere. It combined earlier technologies with some innovative extras, and once the company allowed third-party developers to create native applications for the device, a revolution in mobile communications was under way.</p> <p>That revolution's first phase is over, and Apple is the overwhelming winner so far. It doesn't sell most of the devices, but most of the profits from phones and tablets accrue to what is now, by far, the most valuable enterprise on the planet. The iPhone 5, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/sep/12/iphone-5-launch-apple-live-coverage\">launched this week</a>, will add billions of dollars to Apple's profits and, I'd guess, at least another $100bn to its market value.</p> <p>The new iPhone is about evolution, however. For all of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/12/iphone-5-review-features-4g\">improvements</a> it brings to the previous model \u2013 and they are real \u2013 the device exists in a marketplace where recent major innovations have come not just from Apple, but increasingly from the competitors <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/22/apple-samsung-patent-dispute\">it claims</a> have risen to prominence by copying. In some obvious ways, Apple is now doing a lot of the imitating, and that's a good thing.</p> <p>So let's cheer, among many other incremental improvements: the new iPhone's larger, 4-inch screen, even if it's still a lot smaller than screens millions of us have chosen from other manufacturers. (May we be permitted a snicker or two at the legions of Apple worshippers who, until Wednesday, assured us that a 3.5-inch screen was the absolutely perfect size for a smartphone, because, of course, Apple said it was the perfect size?)</p> <p>Let's applaud Apple's move to create its own mapping system to compete with Google's (and Nokia's). Even if Apple saw <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18393993\">ditching Google Maps</a> as a tactic in its war against the Android operating system \u2013 which now powers a <a href=\"http://whatsyourtech.ca/2012/09/10/looking-at-the-balance-of-power-in-the-mobile-industry/\">majority</a> of smart phones, and which Apple is trying to shut down in a global \"sue everywhere\" strategy \u2013 we users of technology should be glad for the competition.</p> <p>Let's note the radios and software that will let Apple sell the same device for use on the mish-mash of semi-compatible networks, including new, high-speed \"<a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2409610,00.asp\">LTE</a>\" systems around the world. In all of these improvements, and lots of others, let's respect the way Apple has poured a multitude of large and small tweaks into a device that still elicits something bordering on love from many of its users. (One tweak that will annoy iPhone fanatics is having to buy a new adapter so they can keep using the peripheral devices they bought for earlier iPhones, since Apple has changed its proprietary connector.)</p> <p>Apple is still Apple, of course \u2013 the world's most control-freakish consumer products company. Apple tells everyone in its ecosystem what they are allowed to do with the devices they buy or support \u2013 in the latter case, by creating peripherals or apps or content. It manipulates the media too often, substituting uncritical fan-boyism for journalism, though the surprisingly <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57511654-37/apple-has-sprung-a-leak-scoops-about-iphone-5-right-on/\">accurate leaks</a> ahead of Wednesday's announcement suggests that Apple employees are less scared of CEO Tim Cook's wrath than they were of Steve Jobs'.</p> <p>Moreover, Apple shows no signs of moderating its patent war on Android, which, contrary to the company's pious pronouncements, is much more about avoiding competition than protecting actual innovation. With more than $100bn in cash, and more rolling in every week, Apple can launch lawyers at everyone indefinitely.</p> <p>I've chosen not to be part of the Apple ecosystem \u2013 call me crazy, but I like making my own decisions \u2013 and I don't feel remotely deprived of innovation in smartphones. In fact, the iPhone is still lacking features I've had on my Android phone for some time now. One is a larger screen; the one on my current phone is 4.3 inches, and I'm eyeing one that is slightly larger yet. The Android OS is much more adaptable, and my home screen is configured in ways Apple forbids its customers from doing for themselves.</p> <p>If I'm jealous of anything about the iPhone 5 and its immediate predecessor, it's the excellent camera and the knowledge that when the OS is updated, Apple will do its best to bring those improvements to older iPhones. When it comes to OS updates, Android users get routinely screwed by handset makers and carriers that would much rather sell a new device than do the right thing for the people who've already spent their money.</p> <p>There's another big commercial innovator lurking in the mobile world: Microsoft. The more I learn about Windows 8, the more I suspect it could carve out a serious market share, not least because Microsoft's pockets are nearly as deep as Apple's. I would not be at all surprised to see Microsoft buy Nokia outright in the relatively near future, not just use Nokia as a flagship for its mobile phone operating system. Nokia makes world-class hardware, with brilliant industrial design, and Microsoft needs more of this to ensure that people take mobile Windows seriously.</p> <p>I'm also keeping an eye on Mozilla, Ubuntu and other free software players who are trying to move into the mobile space. Android is more open, today, than iOS. It may not be tomorrow: Google has corporate imperatives, too. We need the open-source people more than ever to keep the commercial operators honest.</p> <p>In a couple of weeks, meanwhile, Apple worshippers will be lining up at the company's stores, so they can be the first to spend their money on the latest thing from the company they love. They'll be buying the latest and greatest that Apple sells, no question. What's encouraging to me is that the iPhone 5 still won't be the best phone on the market.</p>",
  "<p>John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, will become the only holder of one of the three \"great offices of state\" to keep a gold-plated pension worth \u00a31m when he reaches retirement age.</p> <p>The Speaker's office had indicated that Bercow would announce his decision in person to MPs on Thursday when the government published a parliamentary bill which will abolish the special pension for future office holders from 2015.</p> <p>But Bercow's office decided instead to issue a statement on parliament's website saying that <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2012/september/speakers-pension/\" title=\"\">when he reaches the age of 65 he will take the full pension</a>.

David Cameron and Chris Grayling, the lord chancellor, will take the normal ministerial pension. Kenneth Clarke, the former lord chancellor, has also said he will not take the special pension.</p> <p>The ministerial pension is based on contributions and years of service.</p> <p>Bercow, 49, has made one concession. He will not take the pension, as he is entitled to do, if he stands down as Speaker as planned in 2018 when he will be 55. He will wait until he reaches 65.</p> <p>By law the changes to Bercow's pension would have had to be agreed by his wife, Sally, because it includes a \"widow's benefit\" should Bercow die before her.</p> <p>In its statement, the Speaker's office said Bercow felt it would not be right for him to receive the enhanced pension in his mid-50s.</p> <p>\"Having taken appropriate advice, he has therefore proposed before he leaves office to waive his entitlement to the Speaker's pension until he reaches the age of 65. At current prices this will mean, along with the pay cut he took in 2010, a total minimum saving of approximately \u00a3430,000 to the exchequer. The Speaker believes it would be wrong, especially in the current economic conditions, not to depart from the status quo in his particular circumstances.\"</p> <p>The government believes Bercow is setting a poor example to public sector workers, who will lose out when the new pension system comes into force in 2015. They have to make greater contributions to their pensions, which will be based on a career average of earnings rather than the current system which is based on an employee's final salary.</p> <p>\"If the Speaker wanted a pension like this in the private sector he would need a pension pot of \u00a31m,\" one government source said. \"The Speaker is delaying his pension but it is still in a different league to anyone else.\"</p> <p>Matthew Sinclair, the chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: \"The Speaker enjoys one of the most generous pensions in the country. If future Speakers, prime ministers and lord chancellors are rightly seeing their non-contributory pension deals axed, it's difficult to justify the current occupants of those posts clinging to theirs. Everyone is being asked to pay more into their pensions so politicians should not be immune from the same pressures at the expense of taxpayers.\"</p>",
  "<p>A bitter feud between two Chicago hip-hop stars and their affiliates has deepened with the launch of a new remix that warns of bloody reprisals over the murder of one of the rappers. </p> <p>The release has provoked concerns of further bloodshed on the city's streets, as rival rappers exchange insults on social media and align themselves with criminal gangs. </p> <p>The feud has led to fierce debate over Chicago's new breed of \"gansta rap\" stars and calls for record labels which distribute their material to drop those who advocate violence.</p> <p>The city's police are struggling with a 38% spike in homicides this year, which they say is caused by gang violence, particularly in the South Side.</p> <p>Police are now looking into whether the 18-year-old rapper Joseph \"Lil JoJo\" Coleman, who was killed in a drive-by-shooting in Englewood on 4 September, had any gang affiliations and whether his murder has anything to do with the ongoing conflict between the Black Disciples and the Gangster Disciples street gangs, <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/14964520-761/lil-jojo-murdered-in-chicago-police-now-looking-at-chief-keefs-tweets-source-says.html\">according to the Chicago SunTimes</a>.</p> <p>Coleman's death came after a bitter war of words with affiliates of Chief Keef \u2013 real name Keith Cozart \u2013 a 17-year-old hip-hop star who rose to fame after Kanye West remixed one of his tracks, I Don't Like. </p> <p>Cozart's version of the track, which has been viewed 14 million times on YouTube, features frames of the rapper with a gun in his hand.</p> <p>Cozart, who is signed to Interscope, the label of rap superstars such as Eminem, 50 Cent, Dr Dre and Diddy, is the subject of a police investigation over a message posted on his Twitter account hours after Coleman was killed, mocking the death.</p> <p>He has since apologised and said someone had hacked into his Twitter account.</p> <p>Coleman had been in dispute with Cozart and his rap affiliates \"Lil Durk\" and \"Lil Reese\", who are signed with Def Jam records, as well as the Black Disciples street gang for months before he was shot. Coleman's track 3 HunnaK (BDK) taunts his rap rivals, and the Black Disciple gang, and also features guns. By posting online videos taunting the violent street gang, Coleman may have tempted fate.</p> <p>Many of Cozart's tweets include the hashtag notation #300. Chicago police say the number 300 is street slang for Black Disciple gang. BDK, meaning Black Disciple Killer, is a taunt from a rival who wants to kill gang members, according to the SunTimes.</p> <p>Now, a grim remix to Coleman's song, which appears to have been made by his associate and friend Lil Jay #00, threatens to avenge his death. It mentions \"Lil Reese\" by name and warns \"Lil Reese gonna die tonight\". The track also accuses others of setting up the murder.</p> <p>No-one from the Chicago police department was available to comment on the new video.</p> <p>However, <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/news/crime/15007423-418/chief-keef-and-lil-jojo-a-rap-feud-straight-outta-englewood.html\">Superintendent Garry McCarthy told the Chicago SunTimes that the tit-for-tat insult trading on social media was ill-advised</a>.</p> <p>\"I don't think it's smart,\" he said. \"That's all part of the problem, they go back and forth. Tit for tat. On social media and in these raps the kid does he's talking about violence and really taunting people.\"</p> <p>A former member of the Gangster Disciples street gang, Wallace \"Gator\" Bradley, condemned the record labels for feeding on the \"aura of violence\" rappers create in their videos.</p> <p>Bradley, who is now president of United In Peace, a community organisation, said: \"When the record companies come in and say they want to do a record deal with these rappers, they want to create that aura of violence. The record labels are feeding on that.</p> <p>He added: \"Social media is very powerful. What makes it even more powerful is when the major record labels and the radio stations are pushing that violence.\"</p> <p>Bradley praised Jay Z and Chicago-born Kanye West's track, \"Murder to Excellence\" for decrying violence, but added: \"Radio stations don't play it. But they need to do all they can to prevent the senseless violence and killing.\"</p> <p>There have been other calls for more restraint from the music industry over who it chooses to promote.<a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-07-27/entertainment/ct-ae-0729-chicago-hip-hop-20120727_1_chief-keef-lil-reese-chicago-rap\"> In July, the Chicago Tribune described Cozart as the \"prince of violent Chicago rap\"</a>. It noted that he had been on house arrest for a gun charge earlier this year and quoted a South Side record label director as saying that the Cozart's gun charge added to his \"authenticity\" in the music industry. </p> <p>When contacted by the Guardian, a spokesman for Interscope refused to comment on the YouTube video of Cozart with a gun. </p> <p>But his label-mate 50 cent waded into the debate to defend the rapper. He said the presence of guns in videos was indicative of the culture being portrayed but did not necessarily indicate criminal activity.</p> <p><a href=\"http://rapradar.com/2012/09/11/50-cent-calls-ryan-cameron-on-v-10/\">50 cent, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, told V103</a>: \"Chicago had 158 homicides this summer; 38 of them was teens. So they gotta go through an investigation to make sure that that's actually someone affiliated with Chief Keef; you can't just put that on 'em because [Coleman] made a diss song and he out there. If he's out there and he's active, and you saw all those guns the boys had in that video, it shows that it's an actual part of their culture.\"</p> <p>An industry source said that Cozart had apologised over his tweet on Twitter which mocked Coleman's death. He said: \"He just recently signed to the label. We continue to look at the situation.\"</p>",
  "<p>The bullet holes, smashed masonry and blood on the walls of the burned-out consulate on the southern outskirts of Benghazi are testament to the gun battle that raged through the building, claiming four lives including that of the US ambassador, Chris Stevens.</p> <p>As the owners of the damaged building and the accommodation block a mile down the road took the Guardian on a tour of the sites on Thursday, reports that the attack was the work of an isolated group seemed to be at odds with the physical evidence and what their staff had told them.</p> <p>\"Better security would not have stopped this,\" said Adel Ibrahim, the owner of the accommodation building where blood is now spattered beneath a hole smashed in a wall by a heavy projectile. \"A security unit is fine if you are facing 10 persons, but there were 400 attackers. [The Americans] would have needed an army to stop them.\"</p> <p>It is clear the US staff and their Libyan guards were subjected to a terrifying, night-long ordeal, which began with protests outside the consulate in the al-Fawahat residential district. Demonstrators gathered in the narrow Venice Street outside the main gated entrance, voicing protests against the reported release in the US of a film that ridiculed Islam.</p> <p>The protest quickly turned violent, the landlords said. Who fired first is a matter of dispute, with some claiming the Libyan security guards hired by the Americans shot in the air, panicking the crowd.</p> <p>There is no doubt about what happened next. The compound is bound by a breeze-block wall topped by barbed wire, but it was not enough to stop the attackers. \"They jumped in from everywhere,\" said Ahmed Busheri, owner of the consulate.</p> <p>In the melee, a single rocket-propelled grenade appears to have been fired from within the compound, detonating on one of the heavy concrete barriers set up outside to deter car bombs.</p> <p>Several of the consulate's Libyan guards were injured during the fighting and others melted away, the landlords said, leaving the diplomats to fend for themselves.</p> <p>Embassy staff had prepared for such an eventuality, having built themselves two positions with sandbags on either side of a villa to the left of the main gate. Three of the Americans \u2013 including Stevens \u2013 were forced to retreat from these positions towards the small terrace in the centre of the villa. This, according to Busheri, is where two of Stevens' security guards died. Stevens himself ran inside the villa, the landlords said, where he suffocated in the smoke from the blaze that has left the interior of guest rooms and a kitchen charred, blackened and heavy with the stench of putrefying food.</p> <p>Once the mob had seized the compound they looted it. The surrounding lawns are covered in stray US army ready meals, broken furniture and, incongruously, the dustjacket of Simon Sebag Montefiore's book on the history of Jerusalem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396127863\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347560734474/US-Libya-consulate-damage-010.jpg\" alt=\"US Libya consulate damage\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Damage inside the burnt consulate building in Benghazi.

Instead, Stevens' body arrived at the emergency ramp at 2am, together with a Libyan embassy translator who had been shot in the leg.</p> <p>There was confusion as the civilians unloaded them from two private cars which had come tearing into the hospital grounds. \"He had no form of identification on him,\" Jehani said. \"One of the people with him said: 'This is the ambassador. The ambassador is suffocating from the smoke.'\" Emergency staff had heard the sound of fighting hours before and sent an ambulance, but it became lost in the confusion. \"We tried to revive him,\" Jehani said. He did not finish the sentence.</p> <p>The night's fighting had not finished. A mile south of the consulate is a smaller walled compound used as accommodation for most of the dozen US staff posted to Benghazi. As the crowd surged into the consulate, one group of diplomats managed to bundle themselves into a white armoured jeep, forcing it out through the main gates, the landlords said. It tore down the highway towards the accommodation block, surviving an attack as it drove through the armed mob.</p> <p>Busheri said the jeep arrived at the accommodation compound gates at 4am and, an hour later, the protesters that had torched the consulate arrived outside. They \"came here to try and ambush, there was an exchange of fire,\" Busheri said.</p> <p>Inside, he showed the result of the fighting. A projectile, possibly a rocket-propelled grenade, had clipped the outside wall and smashed into the main building, blowing out a chunk of masonry. Below it, flecks of brownish blood were spattered on the garden wall, where the fourth American was killed. Staff held off the mob for an hour until government security forces arrived on the scene as dawn broke.</p> <p>Both compounds now lie empty. The consulate's buildings have been torched and three embassy cars are blackened wrecks. US officials arrived at the accommodation block on Wednesday to remove the belongings of the staff living there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396127864\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/13/1347561300020/US-consulate-Benghazi-008.jpg\" alt=\"US consulate, Benghazi\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US consulate, Benghazi.

The grey dumb-bells of a makeshift gym remain outside the main gate. Nearby, a whiteboard pinned to the wall has the instruction: \"pick up your trash before leaving\".</p> <p>\"If I could talk to the families of those who died I would say we are sad because, you know, the ambassador has been good for all Libyans,\" said Kolan Garmud, who co-owns the accommodation building with Ibrahim. \"We will not forget how he helped us in the revolution.\"</p> <p>It is a refrain heard across this shocked city. Stevens was one of the first US diplomats to arrive in Benghazi at the beginning of last year's revolution. He had a reputation here and in the capital, Tripoli, for his enthusiastic backing of medical and social initiatives, and for his informal style.</p> <p>\"He had good relations with my colleagues,\" said Jehani.</p> <p>\"So he was loved?\" a journalist asked.</p> <p>\"He is loved,\" said Jehani, emphasising the word \"is\".</p> <p>Almost overcome with emotion, he said two Boston doctors who had arrived for the inauguration this week had flown home. \"The people who did this, they are a very small minority,\" Jehani said. \"We did not get out of the [Muammar Gaddafi] dictatorship to be under somebody who is driven by hate.\"</p> <p>Benghazi has suffered from activities blamed on jihadists for several months, and anger is directed equally at the protagonists and at a government seen as unwilling to stand up to them.</p> <p>Last April, a UN convoy carrying the envoy Ian Martin was bombed in the city, followed by attacks on the Tunisian consulate and the office of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Jihadists also wrecked a Commonwealth war graves cemetery in the city, and, though it has been repaired, the vandalised stone cross that formed the cenotaph has not been replaced. In June, the British ambassador, Dominic Asquith, narrowly survived when a rocket missed him and hit the armoured car carrying his security detail, two of whom were wounded.</p> <p>The Islamist Ansar al-Sharia brigade is blamed by many here for the violence, particularly with the appearance of a video that appears to show two US embassy vehicles plundered from the burning compound being driven into the brigade's Benghazi barracks. Brigade leaders have issued a denial of responsibility but were unwilling to talk to journalists on Thursday.</p> <p>\"They [Sharia] have pros and cons,\" said Saleh el-Fellah, who works in Benghazi's Friendship Cafe. \"They were the ones who provided security [in the revolution]. The cons are all the bad things they have been doing. They take everything to extremes, they are ruining the reputation of Islam.\"</p> <p>Sadness is everywhere in the city whose proud boast is that it was the cradle of last year's revolution. A Libyan photographer inside the ruined compound came over to offer an unsolicited apology. \"We are not all like this,\" he insisted. \"Libyans do not approve of this.\"</p> <p>There is also unease about how America will react. It has not had an ambassador killed since 1979, and President Barack Obama's vow that \"justice will be served\" has fuelled rumours that US marines now deployed in Tripoli will head to Benghazi and take action.</p> <p>But many also hope the government will move against the protagonists. \"They have to show a fist of steel,\" said Mohammed el-Kish, a former press officer with the National Transitional Council which handed over power last month to Libya's newly elected congress.</p> <p>\"They have got to rid us of these people.\"</p>",
  "<p>Egypt's president, Mohamed Morsi, has moved to limit damage to sensitive relations with the US by pledging to protect foreign embassies on the eve of new protests called by the Muslim Brotherhood against a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/12/hollywood-connection-film-rage-libya?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">controversial film about the prophet Muhammad</a>.</p> <p>Morsi had been criticised for reacting slowly to Tuesday's attack on the US embassy in Cairo \u2013 and for asking the Egyptian embassy in Washington to take legal action in the US against the film's producers before commenting on the assault itself. Violent clashes in central Cairo raged on Wednesday and early on Thursday.</p> <p>\"I call on everyone to take that into consideration, to not violate Egyptian law \u2026 to not assault embassies,\" Morsi said on Thursday. \"I condemn and oppose all who \u2026 insult our prophet. [But] it is our duty to protect our guests and visitors from abroad.\"</p> <p>While international attention was focused on the fatal violence in Libya, also triggered by the film, many observers in Cairo were concerned about the consequences for relations between the US and Egypt, which have entered uncharted territory since the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak and the installation of Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood veteran, as the country's first democratically elected president.</p> <p>Those concerns mounted after Barack Obama said of Egypt: \"I don't think we would consider them an ally, but we don't consider them an enemy. They are a new government that is trying to find its way.\" It was a lukewarm comment from the leader of a country that provides Egypt with $2bn in annual, mostly military, aid as the price for maintaining its 33-year-old peace treaty with Israel.</p> <p>On Thursday attempts were being made to defuse tensions. The Salafi al-Nour party said it was withdrawing from demonstrations. The Brotherhood said its members would stand silently outside mosques on Friday and not march to Tahrir Square or the nearby US embassy.</p> <p>Mahmoud Hussein, secretary general of the Brotherhood, criticised \"small groups\" that attacked the embassy and replaced its flag with a black banner similar to al-Qaida's. \"This is the work of about 20 people, not hundreds of protesters,\" he said. \"It's proof that some groups in the US and Egypt want to sabotage American-Egyptian relations.\" Morsi is due to pay his first official visit to the US this month.</p> <p>US experts and commentators have suggested Morsi is prioritising the appeasement of Islamists over national security issues that worry Washington. Tensions with Israel over Gaza and violence in the Sinai peninsula are other concerns.</p> <p>Exchanges on Twitter provided a revealing glimpse of double-talk and strains behind the scenes. The Brotherhood's English-language Twitter account @Ikwanweb reposted a message from the group's deputy head, Khairat el-Shater, saying he was \"relieved none of @USembassycairo staff was hurt\" and expressing his hope that US-Egypt relations could weather the storm.</p> <p>This was posted, however, while the Brotherhood's Arabic-language Twitter account and official website were praising the protests and calling for a million-man march on Friday. One Arabic-language article on the Brotherhood's site carried the headline \"Egyptians rise to defend the Prophet\".</p> <p>Noting the contradiction, the US embassy in Cairo tweeted a tart response: \"Thanks. By the way, have you checked out your own Arabic feeds? I hope you know we read those too.\" The Brotherhood responded: \"We understand you're under a lot of stress, but it will be more helpful if you point out exactly the Arabic feed of concern.\"</p>",
  "<p>The positive impact of women, not only on business, but also the economy, sustainable development and society in general is increasingly being recognised by organisations like the <a href=\"http://www.unwomen.org/about-us/about-un-women/\" title=\"\">UN</a>, at international conferences like <a href=\"http://www.unwomen.org/the-united-nations-conference-on-sustainable-development-rio20/un-women-events/\" title=\"\">Rio+20</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-law/docs/w/11-745-women-on-boards.pdf\" title=\"\">by governments</a>.

  "<p>The apparent resurgence of the independence movement in <strong>Catalonia</strong> finds echoes among other minority nationalist groups in Europe.</p> <p>The Scottish National party's plan to hold <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence-essential-guide\" title=\"\">an independence referendum in 2014 places <strong>Scotland</strong></a> at the head of Europe's separatist pack. While public opinion polls suggest the \"no\" campaign would prevail were a vote held today, attitudes may change as the referendum draws near.</p> <p>Much of the SNP leader Alex Salmond's efforts to date have been devoted to persuading Scots that there are few risks in breaking away from the UK, and that much would remain the same. His strategy was torpedoed this week from an unexpected quarter when Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/12/barroso-doubt-scotland-eu-membership\" title=\"\">the European commission president, indicated an independent Scotland would not automatically qualify for EU membership</a> and would have to apply like any other candidate country \u2013 a view with implications for those Catalans and others who wish for greater autonomy.</p> <p>As in Catalonia, fiscal and financial considerations will play a big part in Scotland's decision, given current high levels of public spending and the importance of public-sector jobs. The former prime minister Gordon Brown, a Scot, said this week that breaking up the UK would lead to a \"race to the bottom\" on tax and public spending that would hurt ordinary people.</p> <p>Like Catalonia, Spain's <strong>Basque</strong> areas already enjoy significant levels of autonomy. Years of violent attacks and assassinations carried out by the armed Basque nationalist and separatist organisation Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA), meaning \"Basque homeland and freedom\", gave prominence to separatist sentiment. Violence, though, was repudiated by most Basques, and last October, ETA announced a \"definitive cessation of its armed struggle\". Spain's Basques have their own president and parliament, its own police force and control of their own budget. But if the Catalan movement gains traction, a knock-on effect is likely.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the EU, Italy's Northern League (Lega Nord) is nominally committed to the independence of <strong>\"Padania\"</strong>, its term for the country's northern regions but in practice it pursues a federalist agenda. At one time it advocated secession, but in recent years has been drawn into national politics and joined the last Berlusconi government.</p> <p><strong>Bavaria</strong>, in southern Germany, has an even less vigorous separatist tradition dating back to the days of the pre-war Bavarian People's party.</p> <p>At the heart of the EU, though, in Belgium, the separatist tendencies of the French-speaking <strong>Walloons</strong> and Dutch-speaking <strong>Flemish</strong> are frequently aired.</p>",
  "<p>They have raked through business accounts in upmarket ski and beach resorts; they have made spot checks on the owners of high-powered cars and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/19/sardinia-super-rich-tax-coastguards\" title=\"\">luxury yachts</a>; some have even donned swimwear to root out tax-dodging by the firms that rent umbrellas and loungers to sunbathers along the Italian coast. But it was only on Thursday,Italy's tax sleuths revealed a new target for their searchlight: art.</p> <p>The semi-militarised revenue guard, the <em>Guardia di Finanza</em>, said two \"noted art galleries\" in Rome and the north-eastern city of Padua had been temporarily closed as the result of a sweeping investigation into tax fraud and money laundering in the art world.</p> <p>It said 24 galleries and auction houses had been targeted with help from the copyright office of Italy's arts and entertainments industry. The revenue guard said it had succeeded in tracking down more than \u20ac2m of unpaid taxes on so-called artists' resale rights (ARR).</p> <p>Known in Italian as <em>diritto di seguito</em>, ARR entitles the creator of a work of art to a percentage fee each time it is resold by an auction house, gallery or dealer. The statement did not make clear whether the tax was payable on ARR paid to, or withheld from, the artist or artists in question.</p> <p>The guard said it had also uncovered illicit investments and evidence of money-laundering offences involving much bigger sums. It said it had tracked around \u20ac3m in cash payments above the permitted limit and suspicious transactions worth some \u20ac14m that had not been reported to the authorities by the auction houses that had dealt with them.</p> <p>Italy's revenue guard has been given an increasingly free hand to clamp down on tax evasion as Italy struggles to close the gap between its state income and expenditure so that it can start paying off a public debt of almost \u20ac2 trillion.</p> <p>In December, its officers made the first in a succession of headline-grabbing raids on hotels, restaurants and shops in resorts frequented by the rich. Soon after a non-party government headed by a sober economics professor, Mario Monti, took office, they swept into the Alpine resort of Cortina d'Ampezzo, where they stopped more than 100 high-powered cars and cross-checked by computer to see what sort of incomes their owners were declaring on their tax returns. They found more than a third were claiming to earn less than \u20ac22,000 (\u00a317,500) a year. A similar proportion came under suspicion as the result of a more recent check on yachts berthed on the Adriatic coast.</p> <p>The revenue guards have also found widespread evidence of luxury boutiques not giving out tax receipts as required by law.

  "<p><strong>[<em>Update below</em>]</strong></p> <p>You can't change the world if you don't believe in impossible things. On Wednesday, I was reminded that my obstinate faith in the ability of citizens to stand up against an all-out assault on civil liberties by my own government is not so absurd, after all. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/us/judge-blocks-controversial-indefinite-detention-law.html\">Judge Katherine Forrest (an Obama-appointed judge) granted people everywhere a permanent injunction against an unconstitutional provision, section 1021, in the NDAA</a> \u2013 and thus a reprieve from the terror of being indefinitely detained by the US military, without charge, evidence or trial.</p> <p>These incredible powers that my government asserted were its absolute right to possess have been held in check by one judge, seven plaintiffs, four attorneys, public figures who publicized our case when national media would not, and supporters around the globe who pitched in to help cover court costs. My government is so unresponsive, our politics so compromised and our slide away from a democratic republic and toward tyranny so steep, that despair and paralysis would have been the more \"normal\" reaction in the face of things.</p> <p>What I had, however, was a redhead's temper and a fierce sense that we would be in trouble under this law just for doing our work to defend civil liberties. I work with an international volunteer team of people who are dedicated to restoring rights, justice, sanity and decency to our world. And since we had come together and defended WikiLeaks and Bradley Manning \u2013 these pariahs of secretive governments \u2013 and since we were hosting online panel discussions with scholars and dissidents and were about to add to them Middle Eastern revolutionaries, and because I feel responsible for this team of people that I lead, I was not about to stand down on the NDAA.</p> <p>It made me see red to think that with the highest of hopes and most altruistic of aims, I could have led innocent people into danger. This NDAA clause meant that we could be labeled \"associated forces\" of terrorists simply because I had been in direct contact with WikiLeaks, or because I wanted to ask Iraqi citizens on film how it felt to have my country kill their family members in a war founded on lies.</p> <p>My country has worked hard to define and limit the parameters and power of our resistance to this downward slide. A long list of travesties, including the exponential increase in government secrecy, systematic denial of FOIA requests by national security agencies, the building of a surveillance state and the loss of fundamental rights to privacy, the persecution of whistleblowers and the criminalization of protest \u2026 all have formed a disconcerting tapestry. Paired with cynical euphemisms (\"extraordinary rendition\" rather than kidnapping, \"enhanced interrogation\" rather than torture) and disingenuous rhetoric on the part of the president, the context for the NDAA has become an Orwellian milieu where abuses are \"justice\" and \"American liberty\" is secured by taking our rights away. The NDAA was the piece de resistance: its attempt to dramatically expand the power of the federal government to pick and choose who the \"terrorists\" are would have been a power that could see journalists and activists indefinitely detained merely for exercising our rights of free speech. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396129437\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347556538298/katherineforrest_220.jpg\" alt=\"Judge Katherine Forrest\" width=\"220\" height=\"271\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US District Judge Katherine B Forrest</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In court, government attorneys repeatedly refused to define what they meant by key terms \u2013 \"associated forces\", \"material support\", and \"independent\" advocacy and journalism. Did our support for WikiLeaks make us \"associated forces\" of a group some in my government have labeled as terrorists? Would a panel with a member from Hamas be constituted as our providing the organization material \"support\"? Judge Forrest asked my government similar questions <a href=\"http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/09/12/50218.htm\">in her ruling</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Where is the line between what the government would consider 'journalistic reporting' and 'propaganda'? What does 'independent' mean? Who will make such determinations? Will there be an office established to read articles, watch videos, and evaluate speeches in order to make judgments along a spectrum of where the support is 'modest' or 'substantial'.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Thanks to a small handful of determined citizens and a judge who didn't roll over in the face of accusations of interfering with the laws of war, there will be no need for such an office. Sometimes, it is worth believing in impossible things \u2013 like standing up to the United States government, and daring to believe you can win. Sometimes, we do. And because we did, for now at least, and for most of us, due process still stands.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 UPDATE</strong> (at 4pm ET, 13 September 2012]: Less than 24 hours after Section 1021 was permanently enjoined, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-13/u-s-appeals-order-blocking-u-s-military-detention-law.html\">Obama administration lawyers filed an appeal</a>. US government attorneys repeatedly claimed that 1021 and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization_for_Use_of_Military_Force_Against_Terrorists\">Authorization of Military Force (AUMF)</a> provide the same powers. Judge Forrest made it clear her ruling would not interfere in any way with the AUMF.</p> <p>So why did they appeal? Either because they had to, because doing the right thing would not be acceptable in an election cycle \u2013 for fear of charges of being \"soft on terror\" \u2013 or because President Obama doesn't actually mean most of what he says when it comes to protecting democracy and civil liberties.</p>",

  "<p>On the shores of Lake Lugano in Switzerland, is the small town of Campione d'Italia. As the name suggests, Campione is not actually Swiss but part of a small strip of land no bigger than Hyde Park that is technically Italian soil. One its residents is Youssef Nada, an Egyptian-Italian businessman with links to Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood but who has lived in Campione since 1970.</p> <p>As a result of sanctions adopted by the UN security council (UNSC) after 9/11, however, he was banned from entering Switzerland. Until the ban was finally lifted in 2009, Campione was not only his home but also his prison. While there are probably worse places to be stuck than living next to a Italian lake, a gilded cage is still a cage.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the grand chamber of the European court of human rights <a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2012/1691.html\" title=\"\">unanimously ruled</a> that the Swiss government had violated Nada's rights by refusing to vary its travel ban and by denying him any effective opportunity to challenge it. In doing so, it rejected not only the arguments of the Swiss but also the British government who intervened in Mr Nada's case to argue that UN security council resolutions took priority over fundamental human rights.</p> <p>In fact, this judgment is but another chapter in a story that has played out mostly in courtrooms and security council meetings over the last decade but has very real consequences for the protection of basic rights.</p> <p>Since 9/11, the British government has been keen to press the argument that the UN charter enables security council resolutions to trump human rights safeguards. The resolutions that caught the hapless Nada were <a href=\"https://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/\" title=\"\">directed against Al Qaeda and the Taliban</a>. Less than a month after 9/11, the US government asked the UNSC to add Nada's name to a list of individuals alleged to be involved in financing Al Qaeda.</p> <p>Despite years of investigation, neither the Swiss nor the Italian authorities ever found any evidence to suggest that Nada was involved in terrorism. Nada made repeated requests to challenge his listing but was rebuffed: it was a UN decision and, besides, all the supporting material was classified.</p> <p>But the real catch came when Nada argued that the travel ban violated his human rights. The argument put forward not only by the Swiss but also by the UK government was that any rights he had under the European Convention on Human Rights had been superseded by the UNSC resolutions. Sadly the UK has form in this area: in 2007 it <a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2007/58.html\" title=\"\">relied on exactly the same argument</a> as justification for its indefinite detention of a British/Iraqi man in Basra following the Iraq War. In 2008, it made the same argument to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/european-court-of-justice\" title=\"\">European court of justice</a> in Luxembourg in the case of Kadi, which also involved the post-9/11 sanctions.</p> <p>Although the Luxembourg court <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62005J0402:EN:HTML\" title=\"\">dismissed outright</a> the UK's argument that UNSC resolutions trumped basic rights, the Strasbourg court has taken a different strategy. In July last year, it avoided deciding the issue of principle and <a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2011/1092.html\" title=\"\">instead held</a> that the security council resolution in question did not go as far as the UK had claimed. This time, it again ducked the bigger question but its ruling that Nada was entitled to an effective means to challenge UN measures in Swiss courts is likely to prove significant in its own right, not least to the various sanctions regimes operated by the Treasury Asset-Freezing Unit in the UK.</p> <p>More generally, Wednesday's judgment shows that \u2014 as important as sanctions are to the fight against terrorism \u2014 we do not need to dismantle rights in order to make them work. More than 11 years have now passed since the 9/11 attacks. It is surely well past time that the British government abandoned its repugnant argument that security council resolutions trump our basic freedoms.</p> <p><em>Eric Metcalfe acted for the human rights NGO Justice which was a third party intervener in Nada v Switzerland</em></p>",
  "<p>Twenty20 internationals involving the England women's team now carry all the headline-making potential of \"dog bites man\". One day, the man will bite back, but it does not look like happening any time&#xa0;soon.</p> <p>At Wantage Road, away from the television cameras for once, Charlotte Edwards's side gained their third win of the five-match series against West Indies, this time by 10 runs, following earlier successes by eight wickets and 28 runs. It continues a relentless run of success that has brought them 18 successive wins and a stretch of 25 completed games in which they have lost only once, to Australia in Canberra at the start of last year.</p> <p>The England spinners were largely in control and only when the bullish Deandra Dottin ruined some fine figures for Arran Brindle by hitting the last two balls of the 18th over for four and six did an upset seem possible. But Katherine Brunt disposed of her with a superb fast yorker and that was that.</p> <p>If their form is gratifying, then there will come a time \u2013 and, given that they leave for Sri Lanka next Wednesday for the World Twenty20 it may come soon \u2013 when they are tested rather more strongly than they are being at present.</p> <p>This was actually the closest of all the wins and, no matter how hard the coach, Mark Lane, and Edwards the captain try to prevent complacency, the competitive edge must be dulled by a lack of competition.</p> <p>In this match there was an element of experimenting, particularly with the order in which Edwards deployed her bowling options, but overall they looked lacklustre both with the bat and in the field, the latter normally a massive strength, with Sarah Taylor's keeping uncharacteristically scruffy and setting a tone. For a while, the West Indies batsmen ran them ragged between the wickets; they will need to sharpen up in the final two matches.</p> <p>Batting first, England made 103 for seven, fewer than it might or ought to have been, with six boundaries only hit during the innings. It was always going to prove sufficient, even given the return to the West Indies side of their best player, Stafanie Taylor, but the apparent reliance on the runs that Sarah Taylor brings to the side is a little concerning. In this match, Edwards made 17 and Laura Marsh 14 \u2013 each belting one straight boundary \u2013 but it was Taylor's cultured 27 that stabilised the innings before she was splendidly caught low down at mid-on having nailed an on-drive. She is by some distance the best player, her game characterised by the manner in which she can hit cleanly over extra cover in a way that is not possible for others who tend to look to the leg side.</p>",
  "<p>The news that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/12/hbos-banker-peter-cummings-banned-fined-fsa\" title=\"\">Peter Cummings</a>, an HBOS banker, has been banned for life from working in financial services and fined \u00a3500,000 for his role in the banking crisis forces us to ask the question: should we blame people or the system?</p> <p>As someone who coined the term \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/31/peoples-jury-thousand-angry-citizens\" title=\"\">feral elite</a>\" in response to the phone-hacking scandal which had followed hot on the heels of the MPs' expenses and banking scandals, I'm going through a change of heart.</p> <p>My rethink is the fault of David Cameron, who made a speech in June in which he effectively signalled the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2012/jun/25/david-cameron-welfare-entitlement-video\" title=\"\">end of the welfare state</a> as we know it by castigating the poor for their poverty. It was their fault they had failed, and the system should re-engineered to punish such failure. This personalisation of responsibility leads straight to the archetype of the sofa-lying benefits scrounger, and the question: \"Why should we work to pay for them to do nothing?\" Why indeed?</p> <p>This logic of conditionality leads inevitably to the poor law, the workhouse and even the starvation of the \"idle\". After all, it's their own fault! And thus the whole welfare system becomes distorted by believing the worst of people rather than the best.</p> <p>A better question is: \"If people are living their lives on meagre benefits, for which they have to qualify by undertaking ritual humiliation at the hands of the state, why? Why don't they want to make the most of their life in more creative and rewarding ways?\"</p> <p>The answer will be complex: that there are no jobs, or that those that do exist are degrading, mind-numbingly dull and appallingly paid; that those on benefits left school unable to read or write properly; that drugs, alcohol or physical abuse has wrecked their life; that they have mental or physical barriers to overcome; that they have people to care for; or simply that grinding poverty has taken its toll. I don't want to target, blame and vilify these people, I want to give them chance after chance to beat the odds stacked against them and make the best of themselves.</p> <p>So here is my mini-epiphany. If I don't want those at the bottom vilified and targeted then how could I personalise and target those at the top? A feral elite is of course just the flipside of a feral underclass, conjuring an image of rampant and uncontrollable forces; a threat and a danger that galvanises us into action, an enemy to be overcome. These have been the dominant narratives of left and right for aeons. The need for an enemy; bourgeoisie or proletariat, fat cat or scrounger.</p> <p>This tit for tat isn't working. The gap between the rich and poor grows as the language of blame is ratcheted up. In part that's because the right have more resources to vilify their enemy, the poor, than the left have to vilify theirs, the rich. And while abuse of the system at the top is easier to attack \u2013 and cheating benefits to put food on the family table is not the moral equivalent of rigging the Libor system to put another BMW in the drive \u2013 they are both on the same spectrum of the personalisation of morality.</p> <p>The bankers may be in our sights but a narrative that says it's all the fault of Cummings or Bob Diamond just isn't good enough. The issue is not how much the rich or poor should be punished for their individual moral failings but why does the system create such behaviour in the first place?</p> <p>Of course we all bear moral responsibility for ourselves \u2013 we make choices \u2013 but it is the context in which decisions are made that matters most. Yes, the personal is political. But the balance of our blame must switch from <em>who</em> is wrong to <em>what</em> is wrong and with it our reforming energy switched from punishing individuals to changing systems.</p> <p>So the challenge is how to foster systems in which a collective morality creates the conditions that bring out the best in people. What forms of economic, community and family structure are more likely to develop a sense of joint and mutual citizenship of society and stewardship of the planet? What helps us to empathise, respect, co-operate and show compassion? The alternative old left view, found in Marx, is that there is only vested interest \u2013 that there is no room for sentiment or morality, just the scientific logic of class war from which there is no escape.</p> <p>Somewhere between the poles of individual responsibility and class interest we must discover a language and a way of being that holds out the hope of a good life and a good society. Such that when we look into the eyes of others we see not an enemy, not some \"other\" but ourselves. Only from that basis can we observe the golden rule of life \u2013 to treat others as we would have them treat us.</p> <p>Our enemy is not other people but the processes, institutions and belief systems of modern consumer capitalism. Vilifying those at the top for their moral failings just creates the space for stronger forces to punish those at the bottom.</p>",

  "<p>When I was a teenager it was all about shoes. My best friend and I would stand around in pubs and clubs we were too young to be attending (sorry, Mum), and critique men based on their footwear.

Listening to the archive recordings we used in our track All There Is, which date from 1969 and 1984, Jeremy and I were struck by how the subjects discussed dating. They sounded like our single friends. Although more well-spoken. And polite. And none of our peers are called Doris, Gladys or Bill.</p> <p>When we're asked what we look for in a partner, we probably all have a list of wants. Got to be intelligent. Must have a sense of humour. I like them blond. It was the same 50 years ago. But when you're faced with someone you're attracted to, all of that rational thought drops away. Maybe in a couple of months you'll realise you simply can't be with a West Ham fan, or that anyone who doesn't make their own pesto from scratch is an utterly abhorrent human being, but in that moment of initial connection, none of that matters. It's just you and them, and the only priority is discovering whether they too have sweaty palms and a rush of adrenaline. There is hope.</p> <p>Before my husband (bandmate Jeremy Warmsley) and I went on our first date we exchanged hundreds of emails.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/30/rhodes-boyson\" title=\"\">Sir Rhodes Boyson</a> was the minister who finally ensured that nomadic Gypsy and Traveller children in England and Wales had guaranteed access to state schools. A 1977 court case established the right of local education authorities to refuse to admit unsited nomadic Gypsies because they did not belong to their area. The then education secretary, Shirley Williams, promised to look into the matter, but achieved nothing. When Boyson became the minister responsible, I&#xa0;led a delegation of the National Gypsy Education Council, and recall the sheer headmasterliness of the look on his face as the situation of roadside children began to sink in, and his understated Lancashire-accented comment: \"Well, that's not very naice.\"</p> <p>He managed to reverse the situation by stipulating in the 1981 Education Act that schools with spare capacity had to accept applicants regardless of where they lived. It was sold to the Tory party as an increase in freedom of choice. Then, aided by dedicated inspectors, he ensured, against private civil service and party opposition fearful of public prejudice, that the circular explaining the bill made it clear that the law now meant that schools had to accept nomadic Gypsy/Traveller children. It&#xa0;was the end of the guerrilla stage in the Gypsy education movement, and the beginning of its mainstreaming.</p> <p>He knew that I was an active member of the Labour party, since I had a great-uncle who was a Tory activist in his constituency, but party politics never entered his discourse. He was not particularly pro-Gypsy. Some years later, no longer a minister, he took part in a&#xa0;march in his constituency against illegal Gypsy encampments.

American officials have <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/13/161044872/u-s-probes-whether-libyan-attacks-were-planned\">suggested</a> that the assault was pre-planned, allegedly by of one of the Jihadist groups that emerged since the Nato-led overthrow of Libya's Gaddafi regime. So even though the deadly scene in Benghazi may not have resulted directly from the angry reaction to the Islamophobic video, the violence has helped realize the apocalyptic visions of the film's backers.</p> <p>Produced and promoted by a strange collection of rightwing Christian evangelicals and exiled Egyptian Copts, the trailer was created with the intention of both destabilizing post-Mubarak Egypt and roiling the US presidential election. As a consultant for the film named Steve Klein said: \"We went into this knowing this was probably going to happen.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/12/sam-bacile-in-hiding_n_1876044.html\">The Associated Press's initial report</a> on the trailer \u2013 an amateurish, practically unwatchable production called The Innocence of Muslims \u2013 identified a mysterious character, \"Sam Bacile\", as its producer. Bacile told the Associated Press that he was a Jewish Israeli real estate developer living in California. He said that he raised $5m for the production of the film from \"100 Jewish donors\", an unusual claim echoing Protocols of the Elders of Zion-style fantasies. Unfortunately, the extensive history of Israeli and ultra-Zionist <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/168374/sugar-mama-anti-muslim-hate\">funding</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175334/tomgram:_max_blumenthal,_the_great_fear_\">promotion</a> of Islamophobic <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=2fnTHyyvzWg\">propaganda</a> in the United States provided Bacile's remarkable statement with the ring of truth. </p> <p>Who was Bacile? The Israeli government could not confirm his citizenship, and for a full day, no journalist was able to determine whether he existed or not. After being duped by Bacile, AP <a href=\"http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_EGYPT_FILMMAKER?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT\">traced</a> his address to the home of Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, a militant Coptic separatist and felon convicted of check fraud. On September 13, US law enforcement officials <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AP/status/246252690190004224\">confirmed</a> that \"Sam Bacile\" was an alias Nakoula used to advance his various scams, which apparently included the production of The Innocence of Muslims.</p> <p>According to an actor in the film, the all-volunteer cast was <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5942748/it-makes-me-sick-actress-in-muhammed-movie-says-she-was-deceived-had-no-idea-it-was-about-islam\">deceived</a> into believing they were acting in a benign biblical epic about \"how things were 2,000 years ago\". The script was titled Desert Warrior, and its contents made no mention of Muhammad \u2013 his name was dubbed into the film during post-production. On the set, a gray-haired Egyptian man who identified himself only as \"Sam\" (Nakoula) chatted aimlessly in Arabic with a group of friends while posing as the director. A <a href=\"http://casting.backstage.com/jobseekerx/viewjob.asp?jobid=TXYxNuSgxoQo3eKH2L2DW8iOkP2v\">casting notice</a> for Desert Warrior listed the film's real director as <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003085\">\"Alan Roberts\"</a>. This could likewise be a pseudonym, although there is a veteran Hollywood hand responsible for such masterpieces as The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood and The Sexpert who goes by the same name.</p> <p>Before Nakoula was unmasked, the only person to publicly claim any role in the film was Klein, an insurance salesman and Vietnam veteran from Hemet, California, who emerged from the same Islamophobic movement that produced the Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik. Styling themselves as \"counter-Jihadists\", anti-Muslim crusaders like Klein took their cues from top propagandists like Pamela Geller, the blogger who once <a href=\"http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2008/10/how-could-stanl.html\">suggested</a> that Barack Obama was the lovechild of Malcolm X, and Robert Spencer, a pseudo-academic expert on Muslim radicalization who claimed that Islam was no more than \"a developed doctrine and tradition of warfare against unbelievers\". Both Geller and Spencer were <a href=\"http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2011/summer/the-anti-muslim-inner-circle\">labeled</a> hate group leaders by the Southern Poverty Law Center.</p> <p>Klein is an enthusiastic commenter on Geller's website, Atlas Shrugged, where he recently complained about Mitt Romney's \"support for a Muslim state in Israel's heartland\". In July 2011, Spencer's website, Jihad Watch, promoted a rally Klein organized to demand the firing of Los Angeles County sheriff Lee Baca, whom he painted as a dupe for the Muslim Brotherhood.</p> <p>On his personal Facebook page, <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/ALTAR-or-ABOLISH/270356598857\">Altar or Abolish,</a> Klein obsesses over the Muslim Brotherhood, describing the organization as \"a global network of Muslims attacking to convert the world's 6 billion people to Islam or kill them\". Klein urges a violent response to the perceived threat of Islam in the United States, posting an image to his website depicting a middle-American family with a mock tank turret strapped to the roof of their car. \"Can you direct us to the nearest mosque?\" read a caption Klein added to the photo.</p> <p>In 2011, during his campaign to oust Sheriff Baca, Klein forged an alliance with <a href=\"http://www.atvsat.com\">Joseph Nasrallah,</a> an extremist Coptic broadcaster who shared his fear and resentment of the Muslim Brotherhood. Nasrallah appeared from out of nowhere at a boisterous rally against the construction of an Islamic community center in downtown Manhattan on September 11, 2010, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEJMRDqsMCE\">warning</a> a few hundred riled-up Tea Party types that Muslims \"came and conquered our country the same way they want to conquer America\".</p> <p>Organized by Geller and Spencer, the rally was carefully timed to coincide with the peak of the midterm congressional election campaign, in which many rightwing Republicans hoped to leverage rising anti-Muslim sentiment into resentment against the presidency of Obama.</p> <p>Through his friendship with Nasrallah, Klein encountered another radical Coptic separatist named Morris Sadek. Sadek has been banned from returning to his Egypt, where he is widely hated for his outrageous anti-Muslim displays. On the day of the Ground Zero rally, for instance, Sadek was seen <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAAKiDPdnmw&amp;feature=relmfu\">parading</a> around the streets of Washington, DC, on September 11, 2010, with a crucifix in one hand and a Bible implanted with the American flag in the other. \"Islam is evil!\" he shouted. \"Islam is a cult religion!\"</p> <p>With another US election approaching, and the Egyptian government suddenly under the control of the Muslim Brotherhood, Klein and Sadek joined Nakoula in preparing what would be their greatest propaganda stunt to date: the Innocence of Muslims. As soon as the film appeared on YouTube, Sadek <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/12/hollywood-connection-film-rage-libya\">promoted</a> it on his website, transforming the obscure clip into a viral source of outrage in the Middle East. And like clockwork, on September 11, crowds of Muslim protesters stormed the walls of the US embassy in Cairo, demanding retribution for the insult to the prophet Muhammad. The demonstrations ricocheted into Libya, where the deadly attack that may have been only peripherally related to the film occurred.</p> <p>For Sadek, the chaos was an encouraging development. He and his allies had been steadfastly opposed to the Egyptian revolution, fearing that it would usher in the Muslim Brotherhood as the country's new leaders. Now that their worst fears were realized, Coptic extremists and other pro-Mubarak dead-enders were resorting to subterfuge to undermine the ruling party, while pointing to the destabilizing impact of their efforts as proof of the government's bankruptcy. As Sadek <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/09/201291214042970150.html\">said,</a> \"the violence that [the film] caused in Egypt is further evidence of how violent the religion and people\".</p> <p>For far-right Christian right activists like Klein, the attacks on American interests abroad seemed likely to advance their ambitions back in the US. With Americans confronted with shocking images of violent Muslims in Egypt and Libya on the evening news, their <a href=\"http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/musamsurvey.htm\">already negative</a> attitudes toward their Muslim neighbors were likely to harden. In turn, the presidential candidates, Obama and Romney, would be forced to compete for who could take the hardest line against Islamic \"terror\".</p> <p>A patrician moderate constantly on the defensive against his own right flank, Romney fell for the bait, baselessly <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/12/mitt-romney-obama-libya_n_1877406.html\">accusing</a> Obama of \"sympathiz[ing] with those who waged the attacks\" and of issuing \"an apology for America's values\". The clumsy broadside backfired in dramatic fashion, opening Romney to strident <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/middleeast/la-na-libya-campaign-20120913,0,1662505.story\">criticism</a> from across the spectrum, including from embarrassed Republican members of Congress. Obama wasted no time in <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/09/report-drones-headed-to-libya-135317.html\">authorizing</a> a round of drone strikes on targets across Libya, which are likely to deepen regional hostility to the US.</p> <p>A group of fringe extremists had proven that with a little bit of money and an unbelievably cynical scam, they could shape history to fit their apocalyptic vision. But in the end, they were not immune to the violence they incited. </p> <p>According to Copts Today, an Arabic news outlet focusing on Coptic affairs, Sadek was seen taking a leisurely stroll down Washington's M Street on September 11, soaking in the sun on a perfect autumn day. All of a sudden, he found himself <a href=\"http://www.coptstoday.com/Copts-News/Detail.php?Id=32549#.UFD6Fc_DDg4.twitter\">surrounded</a> by four angry Coptic women. Berating Sadek for fueling the flames of sectarian violence, the women took off their heels and began beating him over the head.</p> <p>\"If anything happens to a Christian in Egypt,\" one of them shouted at him, \"you'll be the reason!\"</p>",

  "<p>With <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/11/catalan-independence-rally-barcelona\" title=\"\">Catalan secessionism on the march</a>, as well as debates about Scottish independence and a looming referendum, the question of EU membership for possible new states has become politically charged. By <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/12/barroso-doubt-scotland-eu-membership\" title=\"\">declaring that any state seceding from a member state would not automatically become a European Union member</a>, EU commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso has dealt a serious blow to a key part of the SNP's plans for a \"soft\" form of Scottish independence.</p> <p>EU membership is vital to the SNP's plans in several ways. Automatic membership would emphasise the ease of the transition from being part of the UK to being an independent state, ensure continuity for Scotland's economy and the business world and simplify negotiations with the UK government over independence. While an application for EU membership by an independent Scotland ought to be relatively straightforward, it would mean that the new state would have to spend two or three years outside the EU. Those negotiations might be complicated if Scotland were seen as a precedent for other \"discontented\" regions like Catalonia or Flanders, and perhaps by issues like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement\" title=\"\">Schengen accord</a>.</p> <p>In international law, Scottish membership of the EU would depend on the question of which state or states are successor to the present UK. There are three answers to that question: that the \"rump UK\" of England, Wales and Northern Ireland is the successor state, but a newly independent Scotland is not; that both states are; or that neither is.</p> <p>The last answer is the least likely and least credible \u2013 somewhere, there has to be at least one successor. The balance of views among international lawyers supports the view that the rump UK but not an independent Scotland would be a member, but that is by no means universally held and many disagree. On the international law argument, the position is far from clear, and is unlikely to provide the comfort to Scottish voters that the SNP seeks.</p> <p>Greater help is to be found in a separate line of argument, arising from the <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0013:0046:EN:PDF\" title=\"\">nature of EU citizenship</a>. This was established by the Maastricht treaty in 1992, as something belonging to citizens of a member state and emphasising their shared rights to live and work across the whole of the EU. Initially, many viewed it with scepticism, as a largely meaningless add-on.</p> <p>Thanks partly to extensive academic work, and partly to judgments of the European Court of Justice, it has come to be seen by lawyers as something much more substantial and meaningful, sitting alongside and complementing national citizenship.</p> <p>Recent decisions by the European Court of Justice \u2013 notably <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62008CJ0135:EN:HTML\" title=\"\">Case C-135/08 Rottman</a> and <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62009J0034:EN:HTML\" title=\"\">Case C\u201134/09 Ruiz Zambrano</a> \u2013 have affected thinking about when and how that citizenship can be acquired or lost. In the former case, an Austrian man who moved to Germany to avoid criminal prosecution could not have his German naturalisation cancelled if that would leave him stateless and deprive him of his EU citizenship. In the latter, the Colombian parents of children born in Belgium and so Belgian citizens could not be deprived of rights to remain or work in Belgium, given their status as ascendants of EU citizens. These judgments might be regarded as \"<a href=\"http://eudo-citizenship.eu/citizenship-forum/254-has-the-european-court-of-justice-challenged-member-state-sovereignty-in-nationality-law?start=6\" title=\"\">judicial avant-gardism</a>\", but they are also clearly part of the body of EU law.</p> <p>All this bears on the Scottish debate because, if Scotland were to cease to be part of the EU and had to apply for membership, that would involve stripping EU citizenship from people who are current EU nationals.</p> <p>European court judgments make it clear how hard it is to remove that citizenship, so if a member state breaks up it is unclear whether that takes away EU citizenship. This has led to a legal argument running against the \"international law\" argument, that if an independent Scotland were outside the EU, this would unlawfully deprive Scottish EU citizens of their rights. That argument <a href=\"http://eutopialaw.com/2011/11/14/685/\" title=\"\">has been made most clearly by Aidan O'Neill QC</a>.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2012-007453&amp;language=EN\" title=\"\">August answer to a question in the European parliament</a>, Barroso sought to rebut the \"citizenship\" argument, repeating the treaty's language that \"EU citizenship is additional to and does not replace national citizenship (that is, the citizenship of an EU member state)\", and that \"in the hypothetical event of a secession of a part of an EU member state, the solution would have to be found and negotiated within the international legal order\".</p> <p>He reiterated the strongly \"statist\" approach in his remarks on Wednesday. This overlooks the jurisprudence of the European court and the scholarship surrounding that; Barroso sees the EU in a more conventional way as simply a club of states, which triggers ancillary rights for individuals only as a side-effect, rather than putting them at the core of what the EU is now about, as the court and many scholars have.</p> <p>Barroso's position looks like a powerful rejection of that line of reasoning, and an assertion of a more conventional realpolitik. While the \"citizenship\" argument bolsters the SNP's claim to EU membership, that cuts little ice among EU-level politicians. At the very least, the uncertainty this creates about the position of an independent Scotland further complicates the SNP's task in an independence referendum.</p>",

  "<p>The New York City board of health has approved Mayor Michael Bloomberg's controversial plan to limit the amount of sugary soda drinks that can be purchased at food outlets to 16 ounces (473ml).</p> <p>When Bloomberg first announced his plan over three months ago, he sparked a nationwide debate about the extent of government control over an individual's healthcare choices. In June, we asked you to share your thoughts with us about the idea \u2013 is the plan a plausible solution to the obesity epidemic in the US? Or is the legislation just another example of Bloomberg's 'Nanny-stateism'?</p> <p>Since then, the mayor has imposed age restrictions on tanning beds and introduced \"Latch On NYC\", an initiative to teach new mothers the \"breast is best\" principle.

I am cautiously in favor of voting for the ban, evaluating its impact, and making another, more informed decision to keep / repeal the ban based on the data at that point.</p> <p><strong>Then:</strong> Instead of bans, I support more subversive measures that reward good behavior and make it easier to choose well and punish bad behavior and make it inconvenient or expensive to choose poorly.

Make the choice to eat and drink healthy and stick to it for yourself and your children. No I don't need a ban to know what's good for me and my family.

However, by itself I fear it is doomed to failure. Such a ban can only succeed if advertising such products is curtailed, ingredients like glucose-fructose syrup withdrawn and an overall message of moderation preached.</p> <p><strong>Then:</strong> I think the soda ban is a perfectly acceptable solution to a burgeoning problems. While there might be cries of 'nanny state' 16 ounces is getting on close to a pint of sugary liquid \u2013 and with cases of type 2 diabetes rising it seems a logical step to take.</p> <p><strong>Over to you \u2013 what do you think of the legislation?

  "<p>The army of volunteer games makers, rightly celebrated as the heroes of the Olympics and Paralympics, are a partial vindication of the \"big society\" idea.</p> <p>Politicians such as Boris Johnson have expressed hope that the Games' legacy will be to inspire many more people to volunteer, so that the aims behind the big society \u2013 shrinking the state and public debt \u2013 can be realised.</p> <p>Away from the excitement and glamour of a global event, much voluntary work is tough and thankless. Volunteering and charities may be important, but abundant evidence shows that expecting them to take over state services is unrealistic. Many of them rely on government grants and are having to scale down their services, or even close, as a result of cuts.</p> <p>In my new report for the British Academy Policy Centre, <a href=\"http://www.britac.ac.uk/policy/Big-Society-and-neighbourhood-problems.cfm\" title=\"\">The 'Big Society' and concentrated neighbourhood problems</a>, I draw on extensive research to chart the history of community-centred activity in the USA and the UK, showing the big society idea as part of a long tradition of community organisation and social movement. There is little evidence that the big society, as opposed to the big state, will on its own carry us through the difficult challenges we face.</p> <h2>We need government action too</h2> <p>The state cannot withdraw from its overarching responsibility towards society as a whole, and neither can private interests, at whatever level, adequately fill those roles, particularly in poor communities. The tortuous American reform of health care, the sub-prime mortgage and banking crises, the eurozone crisis and steep energy price rises have shown just how vulnerable weaker members of society are, and how much we rely on co-operative action at government level as well as in communities.</p> <p>The big society started out as an idea about the small scale at which communities organise their survival. My research shows that community self-help and mutual aid are lifelines in the workings of society and neighbourhoods. However, the more closely we examine the complementary functions of state and civil society, the more interconnected they become. Major challenges such as climate change, energy shortages and skills mismatches will rely increasingly heavily on community resilience and new kinds of community capacity. But they will rely equally on the wider function of the state and also on inter-governmental co-operation.</p> <p>Community organising does not deliver in a vacuum; communities rely on a response from powerful sections of society, including the state, to equalise conditions by distributing power, responsibility and resources more fairly. When the gap between the top and the bottom of society grows too wide, then the response is too weak. This is a major factor in societal breakdown, affecting modern, wealthy but highly unequal societies.</p> <h2>Three conditions for success</h2> <p>In the move towards strong communities there are three conditions for success. Firstly, the state must recognise and reinforce its long-run role as broker of different interests in favour of communal justice, the rule of law, enforcement of basic conditions and equalisation, holding together increasingly diverse and sometimes divided communities. We need to balance the power of citizens to form groups and to take collective action with the power and duty of the state to enforce openness and underpin these efforts, requiring transparent, fair and firm regulation, a clear, supportive legal framework and financial transparency.</p> <p>Secondly, the state must redeploy public resources in favour of disadvantaged communities through locally responsive services, devolving some decision-making to targeted community-level organisations, within a widely supported public framework of legal, regulatory and financial safeguards. Co-operatives, development trusts, non-profit mutuals and small local private enterprises flourish within a strong framework of support, training and access to information. They also require collaborative structures, as European countries demonstrate. This approach has enabled several hundred tenant management organisations (TMOs) to grow in council estates, making them a constant source of inspiration.</p> <p>Thirdly, citizens in small community-based groups cannot tackle widespread, complex and costly problems alone. They lack the power, the technical know-how, the resources and the broad consensus of support that is necessary. They need a supportive, responsive state. There are some problems that are simply beyond what any one group or series of groups can do; they require higher level governmental action. Getting this balance right has become the art of government.</p> <p>Current cuts in public spending are undermining the long-run community infrastructure built up over decades alongside the evolution of the state. State withdrawal particularly undermines the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Yes, communities and individuals are capable of organising and delivering many basic forms of help. The state is inevitably more remote, bureaucratic and less sensitive to local problems. However, as individuals and members of small social groups, we are all part of something bigger, called society.</p> <p><em>Anne Power is professor of social policy at LSE and British Academy Policy Centre author</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>The men's college soccer conference seasons kick off next week. Here, we take a look at the players expected to shine, which sides will be pushing for the title, what conferences are the strongest and the games to look out for in 2012. </p> <h2>Players to watch out for</h2> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nscaa.com/news/2012/08/2012-mac-hermann-watch-lists\">MAC Hermann Trophy Watch List</a> has been decided, with plenty of collegiate talent across the nation. The list consists of 42 men (there are 38 players on the women's list) who are expected to shine in 2012. However, the winner of this prestigious award, which is the highest individual honor in collegiate soccer, will not necessarily come from this list. </p> <p>Here are a few of this season's frontrunners and some players who aren't quite on people's radars \u2013 not just yet, anyway. </p> <p>UNC senior <strong>Martin Murphy</strong> is one of those not on the Watch List, but he won't go unnoticed for much longer. He has scored four goals in his first four pre-conference games for the Tar Heels. </p> <p>A name firmly on the MAC Watch List is UConn's sophomore goalkeeper <strong>Andre Blake</strong>. After an impressive freshman season \u2013 the Jamaican set a UConn record for 15 clean sheets behind the second-best defense in the nation and became the first freshman in Big East history to win a conference award as goalkeeper of the year \u2013 Blake will make Storrs a daunting place to visit. (Speaking from experience, more than 4,000 screaming Huskies fans on a cold fall night can generate quite an atmosphere.) </p> <p>Another Jamaican player to watch out for is Coastal Carolina's striker <strong>Ashton Bennett</strong>. He has four goals and two assists in his first six games this season, as he aims to beat his 23 goals from last season, when he lead the nation. Bennett is of the same ilk as Vancouver's Darren Mattocks and he will be hoping to follow his countryman into Major League Soccer after another stellar season in the Big South. </p> <h2>Elite programs set to shine once again</h2> <p>With the preseason polls out in August, not much has changed after the first few weeks of non-conference competition. Perennial powerhouses Connecticut, Maryland, North Carolina and UCLA remain in the upper echelons of the rankings. </p> <p>But every year at least one of the early-season favorites drops by the wayside. In 2011 it was Louisville who floundered \u2013 before recovering to make it to the quarters, where they lost in overtime to UCLA \u2013 and nobody expected that. This season looks just as unpredictable but surely one of the fancied teams from the ACC or Big East will stumble in the face of intense competition week in week out across the stacked conferences. </p> <p>However it's hard to see North Carolina not making it to the final four, after an impressive start to the season in a challenging non-conference schedule. Wins over Boston University, West Virginia and Virginia prove North Carolina's pedigree and with senior goalkeeper Scott Goodwin in fine form (conceding just once in their first four wins), they'll be favorites to lift the College Cup once again in 2012. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.goheels.com/mediaPortal/embed.swf\"> <object width=\"460\" height=\"369\" id=\"embed\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.goheels.com/mediaPortal/embed.swf\" /><param name=\"quality\" value=\"high\" /><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"flashVars\" value=\"catid=50114&amp;id=1040930&amp;server=http://www.goheels.com/XML/titanv3/&amp;pageurl=http://www.goheels.com/mediaPortal/&amp;jtv=3350&amp;skin=3350&amp;gaa=UA-9118161-7&amp;sitename=jtvs.3350.unctarheels\" /><embed name=\"embed\" pluginspage=\"http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer\" src=\"https://www.goheels.com/mediaPortal/embed.swf\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"480\" height=\"301\" quality=\"high\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" flashvars=\"catid=50114&amp;id=1040930&amp;server=http://www.goheels.com/XML/titanv3/&amp;pageurl=http://www.goheels.com/mediaPortal/&amp;jtv=3350&amp;skin=3350&amp;gaa=UA-9118161-7&amp;sitename=jtvs.3350.unctarheels\"></embed></object> </figure>  <p>However, PAC 12 and Big West powerhouses UCLA and UC Santa Barbara will have something to say about that. The two teams face off on 21 September, to try to settle who rules the West Coast. </p> <p>South Florida and UCONN lead the Big East charge, with both teams chasing a first national title after recent disappointments in the quarterfinals. </p> <p><strong>FINAL-FOUR PREDICTION:</strong> North Carolina, UCLA, UConn, Akron </p> <h2>Powerhouse conferences</h2> <p>This argument seems to grow stronger each season: ACC? Big East? PAC 12? Big West?</p> <p>The Big East can certainly stake a strong claim for being the best conference. In the 2012 MLS SuperDraft, 13 Big East players were selected among the 32 picks, strengthening the Big East's claim to be the top soccer conference. Of those 13, Nick DeLeon (DC United), Austin Berry (Chicago Fire), Tony Cascio (Colorado Rapids) and Raymond Gaddis (Philadelphia Union) went on to excel in their rookie MLS season. The Big East also sent more teams \u2013 seven \u2013 to the national championships than any other conference in 2011. </p> <p>But the ACC has long been the breeding ground for the USA's top talent. Current USMNT players Maurice Edu, Michael Parkhurst, Clarence Goodson, Graham Zusi and Oguchi Onyewu are just a few names to have come through the ACC. With West Virginia leaving the Big East this season and Syracuse and Pittsburgh on their way to the ACC in 2013, a dramatic shift in the dominant soccer conferences will take place over the next few seasons. The ACC looks set to take over as the nation's best. The patient style of play on show across the ACC differs from the physical approach in many other conferences, helping players to step up to the next level. </p> <p>The Big West offers up some dangerous ranked sides in UC Santa Barbara and UC Irvine. Other top conferences in 2012 include Conference USA (which features UAB, South Carolina and SMU) and the CAA conference, where James Madison and Old Dominion are looking to build on successful 2011 campaigns. </p> <h2>Must-see games</h2> <p>The ACC is once again the place to be. The strength of soccer in the southeast is growing year by year. With the Carolina RailHawks and Orlando City \u2013 of the NASL and USL respectively \u2013 pushing for an MLS franchise, the hotbed of college soccer may well grow hotter still. </p> <p>A conveyer belt that makes collegiate stars into seasoned pros exists at schools such as UNC, Wake Forest, Duke and Maryland. Meetings between these powerhouses in 2012 are sure to catch the attention of scouts from MLS and beyond. </p> <p>Maryland takes on Boston College in the first round of ACC action this weekend. UNC \u2013 currently ranked No1 and the 2011 national champions \u2013 have some tricky games in conference play, and their home tie against Virginia will be televised nationally on Fox Soccer on 21 September. A huge ACC match-up, with No3-ranked Maryland, follows in October. Check <a href=\"http://www.nscaa.com/news/2012/07/fox-soccer-nscaa-game-of-the-week-schedule\">here</a> to see which games will be aired on national television. </p> <p>There are still some top non-conference matches coming up. On Friday, St John's travel to the renowned Akron, which has produced endless MLS products since Caleb Porter joined the program, and Akron will also host South Florida on 16 September. This will be Porter's last season with Akron, after <a href=\"http://www.portlandtimbers.com/news/2012/08/timbers-name-caleb-porter-head-coach-2013-season \">he agreed to take charge of the Portland Timbers</a> in MLS in 2013. His players will be desperate to follow up their 2010 national title and send their coach out on a high. </p> <p>The No8-ranked UCLA now face a five-game road stretch, with their tie against No9-ranked UC Santa Barbara the pick of the bunch. The Bruins have already faced three nationally ranked teams this year and their remaining schedule is arguably the nation's toughest. They will be expected by many to go all the way to <a href=\"http://www.ncaa.com/news/soccer-men/article/2011-12-07/2012-college-cup-announced\">the Final Four in Alabama</a> for the second year running.</p>",
  "<h2>Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at price comparison site uSwitch</h2> <p>\"After the disappointment of an underwhelming iPhone 4S, there was a fair bit of pressure on Apple to deliver something very special. Fortunately for Tim Cook, his 'beautiful' iPhone 5 should put the bite back into Apple. Apple simply couldn't afford another lukewarm offering and luckily the iPhone 5 will ensure Apple doesn't lose pace with Samsung's dominant Galaxy S3. This time it had to be all about the hardware as much as software. In this regard, Apple has delivered and then some.\"</p> <h2>Daniel Gleeson at research firm IHS, which is predicting Apple will sell 149m phones in 2012, compared with 93m in 2011</h2> <p>\"The fourth quarter this year will be Apple's biggest quarter for iPhone sales in history. This year's iPhone 5 announcement comes as a significant departure from previous models. The addition of a new, larger screen is a fundamental change in product design. Furthermore, the iPhone 5 is the first member of Apple's smartphone line to feature 4G connectivity, accelerating data speeds dramatically compared with previous models. These major improvements will drive strong sales for the iPhone 5.\"</p> <h2>Fred Huet, managing director at telecoms specialist Greenwich Consulting</h2> <p>\"The decision to omit NFC in the iPhone 5 could cost Apple. It is just a matter of time before the smartphone replaces the plastic card, and by skipping this technology, Apple may have missed a valuable opportunity to take the lead in this market. With over 400m active credit card accounts on file, Apple had a prime opportunity to convert its customers using a sleek mobile payment system tied to the iPhone. Instead they could find that they have fallen behind closest rivals Samsung, Nokia and indeed Motorola, all of whom introduced the technology into their devices last week.\"</p> <h2>Alistair Young at research firm Analysis Mason, on Apple replacing Google Maps with its own app on the home screen</h2> <p>\"Google Maps will lose up to a third of its mobile users in Western markets because of Apple's alternative map service. According to our recent study, 28% of Google Maps users in France, Germany, Spain, UK and the US are on iOS [Apple's phone software]. Three out of four iOS users used Google Maps at least once over two months. Location information and mapping are at the forefront of application innovation. By offering its own map service, Apple will not only gain control over one of the most popular applications on its devices but it will also offer developers better and more integrated location-based tools for iOS.\"</p> <h2>Guy Potter of online market researcher Usurv</h2> <p>\"We ran an immediate poll to gauge people's instant reactions to the new phone and as with most Apple launches there seems to be a fair bit of positive excitement. The fact that 44% of existing iPhone users already want to upgrade \u2013 without needing to think about it \u2013 shows the loyalty to the brand. However, none of the new features seemed to instantly grab people \u2013 with 39% saying none of them really appealed.\"</p> <h2>Francisco Jeronimo of research firm IDC</h2> <p>\"What Apple has been doing over the last few years is to improve each hardware and software feature of the iPhone to offer the best experience possible, rather than packing the handset with features that consumers don't use or don't understand. The devices continue to offer a unique premium feeling due to the design and materials, so we foresee a strong Christmas season for Apple. But Apple still faces some challenges. The iPhone 5 does not come with any unique service or hardware features that are not available on the high-end Android devices.\"</p> <h2>Shaun Collins, founder of telecoms researcher CCS Insight</h2> <p>\"The announcement goes beyond just the launch of the iPhone5. With the iPhone 4S 8GB, Apple is now able to offer its products with iOS6 at ever more aggressive price points in the UK. As an entry level iPhone, it's a formidable competitor.\"</p> <h2>Dan Russon of IT consultancy Xceed Group</h2> <p>\"The easier and faster devices are to use, the more employees will want to use them, and unless businesses start to provide the iPhone 5 or other 4G enabled devices as standard (this large outlay in tight economic times is likely to be unappealing), the momentum driving people to use their own devices will increase. The danger is that this demand will arrive before many organisations have fully got a handle on the security aspects of their own BYOD [bring your own device] policies, which could, in turn lead to even greater risks.\"</p>",
  "<p>My mother, Sue Knight, who has died aged 74, was known by many throughout the Winchester area of Hampshire as a tireless volunteer, giving practical and emotional help to those with dementia and their carers. She was recognised not only by affected families but by professionals for her deep understanding of the effects of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's, and for her extraordinary empathy with those involved.</p> <p>Sue was born in Hong Kong, where her father, Graham Heywood, worked as a meteorologist. In 1940 she and her mother, Valerie, were evacuated to Australia, where her sister, Veronica, was born. In early 1942, her mother, unaware that her husband was alive but had been interned in a Japanese prison camp, brought the children to Britain. After the war the family were reunited and returned to Hong Kong, but in 1952 Sue was sent as a boarder to Godolphin school, in Salisbury, Wiltshire.</p> <p>After training as a children's nurse, in 1961 she met Mike Knight, home on leave from the colonial service. Six weeks later they went together as husband and wife to Nyasaland, where the first two of their children were born. They returned to the UK in the mid-60s as Nyasaland became the newly independent Malawi.</p> <p>While her four children were growing up, Sue was a full-time wife and mother. In time her mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and her father-in-law with vascular dementia. In caring for them, Sue was witness to the fear and confusion of dementia sufferers, the limitations of support networks and the practical and emotional difficulties faced by carers, at a time when little was known about managing dementia.</p> <p>Following their deaths in 1992, Sue joined the committee of the Southampton branch of the Alzheimer's disease society. In 1995 she became a founder member of the Winchester branch. Although gaining a reputation for being a thorn in the side of officialdom, she is remembered with warmth by those she helped. She gave advice to sufferers and carers and lobbied for more facilities and greater awareness. In particular, she initiated a monthly lunch club at which people with dementia and their carers could mingle with others without the embarrassment that leads many families to become isolated. She befriended those in need and gave practical assistance at all times of day and night.</p> <p>In recognition of her expertise and commitment, she was appointed a governor of the local mental health trust, from which she stood down only six weeks before her death.</p> <p>She is survived by Mike, her children \u2013 Nicola, Tim, Bridget and me \u2013 seven grandchildren and Veronica.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Title:</strong> 90s Comedian</p> <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2006</p> <p><strong>The set-up:</strong> Stewart Lee is currently Britain's best standup comedian. No poll will ever crown him that, and he has certainly not made the money or the heavy impact of, say, Billy Connolly or Eddie Izzard. But if we are judging this on who causes most laughter, provokes most thought, and does both in new ways, then Lee owns the podium.</p> <p>His career began brightly in the mid-1990s, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjrn4dXE2yI\" title=\"\">when he wrote and performed some excellent work</a> in a double act with Richard Herring. By 2001, however, television had lost interest in him, and he had lost interest in standup, devoting much of his time instead to a new musical called Jerry Springer \u2013 The Opera. This became a big success, before almost collapsing under the weight of protest from Christians who had heard about its irreverent portrayal of Christ, and were provisionally offended. Lee was subjected to a hate campaign, which he lost much sleep and money over.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bjrn4dXE2yI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bjrn4dXE2yI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjrn4dXE2yI\">Reading this on a mobile?

Yes, he leaves punchlines unspoken and deconstructs his own jokes, but so do many comics. Yes, he speaks in a drab, affectless monotone. Yes, he is sarcastic, deadpan, outwardly miserable, obsessed with technique and fourth-wall-breaking \u2013 to the extent that this show begins with him telling the audience that he won't pick on them if they go to the toilet, before peering into the camera to explain that we can press pause to do the same. (\"And I won't even know that it's happening.\")</p> <p>What is most distinctive about his work, however, is not that it is anti-comedic, but that it is so theatrical. Lee has since <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Escaped-My-Certain-Fate/dp/0571254810/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347387092&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\">analysed this performance in a book</a>, which picks apart the fine decisions behind every laugh, yet it is just as important that he performed it with such dramatic intensity. The long pauses are what Lee commands a room with, the repetitions, the climbing down into the audience, the delivery of some bits with his back turned, the sudden dropping of the microphone and deciding just to shout. There are comedians who risk all kinds of rudeness, but how many dare to take themselves this seriously? The exciting feeling with Lee is that he is completely in control of what he is doing, yet he could do anything \u2013 as witnessed by the extraordinary moment where, in the wake of the 7/7 attacks, he gets this audience to applaud the \"gentleman bombers\" of the IRA.</p> <p>While later, in a bravura last half-hour, he sneaks up on just about the most extremely blasphemous image that any Christian could imagine \u2013 Christ splaying open his own anus for Lee to vomit into, since you ask \u2014 before coolly setting out his reasons.</p> <p>Lee used to like saying that his critical reputation oscillates, roughly, on a five-year cycle. This must be why, six years after I first saw it, I am still deluded into thinking that 90s Comedian is the best standup show I've ever seen.</p> <p><strong>Comic cousins:</strong> Steven Wright, Neil Hamburger, Chris Morris, Tim Vine, Simon Munnery.</p> <p><strong>Steal this:</strong> \"In January last year, the Vatican issued an official statement reminding Dan Brown readers that the books are largely fictional and full of historically unverifiable information.\" [Pause.]</p>",

It's not. It's generic ravey Euro dance with guitars, or at least it is if Psy's other tunes are any measure.

  "<p>The Stoke stage was where the Tour of Britain went pear-shaped for Team Sky in 2010 and in this year's edition something similar happened as the elite British squad's domination of the race came to an abrupt and unexpected halt after three stage wins in the first four days. The first abortive trip to the Staffordshire Moorlands looked like bad luck, but the second had the unhappy smack of carelessness about it.</p> <p>Sky's race leader Mark Cavendish trailed into the finish in the third group almost 12 minutes behind the stage winner Marc de Maar of United Healthcare, relinquishing his lead to the Australian Leigh Howard, but the biggest surprise was to see the Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins alongside the world champion.</p> <p>Wiggins raised eyebrows by opting to wait for his team-mate just as the leaders were pulling away with around 25 miles to go, a bizarre decision given that Cavendish clearly had no chance of getting back to the main field. \"At that moment it was the point of no return,\" said the Team Sky directeur sportif Servais Knaven. \"Brad was in between the two groups waiting for Cav and the gap looked shorter than it was. Brad wanted to help us defend the jersey today and did everything he could to help Cav. We hoped for a bit more today but it's been a hard race up to this point and a hard season.\"</p> <p>De Maar escaped from a select lead group in the streets of Stoke, four miles from the finish, and won alone, with his team-mate Boy van Poppel also in the frontrunners and moving to second overall behind Howard. But the battle for the overall standings will now be between eight riders who remain within 34sec of the stage two winner Howard; they are all those who figured in both the Sky-instigated sort-out in the northwesterly into Blackpool on Wednesday, as well as this second selection in the Peak District.</p> <p>The 28-year-old De Maar, who was born in Assen, Holland, but is the national champion of Curacao, said his win was partly due to an unlucky fall a kilometre before his attack, when he followed the Endura rider Paul Voss straight across a crossroads rather than turning right. \"I was so full of adrenalin that I didn't feel my legs for four or five kilometres.\" He crossed the line in a style which is rarely seen in a professional bike race, waving his thermal gilet in one hand, having taken it off in the final kilometres, stuffed it up the front of his jersey, then realized as he was about to take the win that it would make an unsightly bulge. It was the only glitch in an incisive finale.</p> <p>As well as Howard and Van Poppel, and a second Healthcare rider in Chris Jones, the eight contenders include a brace from Garmin-Sharp, Sep Vanmarcke and Nathan Haas, the Italian Damiano Caruso of Liquigas, with just one rider from Sky \u2013 the German domestique Christian Knees, the sort of \"solid\" rider who is well capable of winning an event of this kind - and the climber Jonathan Tiernan-Locke, the only Briton still in the mix after dancing briefly away from the opposition in his usual style on the final climb, Gun Hill.</p> <p>The former mountain biker was far and away the strongest climber in last year's Tour of Britain, where he finished sixth after dominating every time the road went uphill. He has taken on a new dimension since moving from the Rapha-Condor team, where his career was revitalized after several years in the wilderness, to the Endura squad, with whom he landed stunning victories in the Tour of the Mediterranean and the Tour du Haut-Var in the very early season.While his Endura team have ridden hard to keep him he has been strongly linked to a move to Sky for next season since attending a training camp in Tenerife with Wiggins in April. This year's route is more suited to his punchy climbing skills, with more ascents in his native Devon , and a brief but brutal leg to the finish in Guildford on Sunday. First up there are two climbs of Caerphilly Mountain close to Friday's finish in South Wales, which could prove decisive.</p>",

  "<p>Where is the ice? We are now at 83.20N which is very close to the north pole yet still there is no continuous ice cover (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/sep/06/history-sea-greenpeace-arctic-sunrise\">head here for more on</a> my journey through the Arctic). We are mostly among small, thin, one- and two-year-old floes, with very little of the older, harder and more resilient \"multiyear\", or permanent ice that you would expect in these latitudes.</p> <p>Our ice pilot, Arne Sorensen, went up in the helicopter and found little change even as far north as 83.50 \u2013 just 350 miles from the pole. Just finding an ice floe big enough to moor the 50 metre-long Arctic Sunrise for the scientists aboard to conduct their experiments has proven harder than expected \u2013 something that many think is almost unheard of at this latitude.</p> <p>The obvious inference is that the ice has retreated far further this year than before and we will need to check previous years' satellite data to confirm this. But there may actually be far less ice in the Arctic than the satellite figures suggest.</p> <p>In winter when the sea surface is frozen up here, scientists can be pretty sure how much ice there is. But in the summer months when the ice is melting and there's much more water around, the satellite can become confused.</p> <p>It can think that melt water sitting on the ice floes is open water; it may not be able to tell the size of the floes or the distance between them; it can have problems \"seeing\" the ice because of clouds and fog.</p> <p>In short, the melting effect makes it much harder to quantify the amount of ice there is and the satellite tends to see more ice than there actually is. That's why monitoring groups such as NSIDC or the university of Bremen try to compensate with weather filters or by calculating the ice extent over a number of days rather than on individual ones.</p> <p>We know, here on the ship, how misleading the satellite data can be.</p> <p>Here, possibly only 50% of the sea is covered in ice. Yet the data is telling the scientists that there is continuous ice cover at this latitude.</p> <p>That's why Julienne Stroeve, ice expert from NSIDC the folk expected to flag the record minimum ice extent record in a few days' time \u2013 has been filming the ice conditions every few hours.</p> <p>When she returns, she hopes to match her real-time observations of the ice conditions with the satellite data. She speculates that the low fog conditions we have experienced could be making it seem there is more ice than there actually is.</p> <p>Either way, the situation is deadly serious. Both satellites and human observation suggests that the ice is now so thin over much of the arctic that it doesn't matter how much it freezes in winter, because it will melt in the summer. That would mean ice-free summers in the arctic coming far sooner than the models have predicted.</p> <p>Strangely, what we are beginning to see is just what the old Arctic explorers and visionaries such as Elisha Kane, Isaac Hayes, Captain W E Parry and Sir John Barrow hoped to find. It was widely believed from the 16th century that there was a tepid lake at the north pole, and that another continent lay beyond the ice. The problem facing explorers then was to get beyond the icepack which barred the route. It was this prospect of Arcadian lands that spurred these adventurers.</p> <p>Today, the prospect of an ice-free Arctic and easy access to the other side of the world has become the dream of oil, mining and shipping companies. The profits they see inn in the ice free sea are similar to those seen by the British from a clear passage over the top of the world to China and the east.</p> <p>But as Shell found off the coast of Alaska this week, nature bites back. No sooner had the company started preliminary drilling for oil in the Arctic Chukchi sea <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/2012/09/10/2619205/shell-halts-chukchi-sea-drilling.html\" title=\"\">it had to abandon the work because of freezing conditions</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Joss Whedon's impact on youth culture is already hard to overestimate. Now he's made the first great contemporary Shakespeare since Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet. Not that it's just for the kids \u2013 the Globe crowd, too, should extend this warm embrace.</p> <p>The concept is not so incongruous: Whedon is one of the few blockbuster film-makers who also has a semi-rep acting company. Small-name regulars from Buffy, Angel and Firefly reel off blank verse in the director's own LA mansion (the open-plan architecture makes for easy eavesdropping, as well as minimal budget). He shoots the play like an episode of Desperate Housewives \u2013 an especially farcical one, in black and white, without an eye on the ad breaks, and with a script by Shaky.</p> <p>A distracting lounge remix of Sigh No More, Ladies aside (check out the hip-hop \"nonny-nonnys\"), it couldn't be a better match. Arch innovations such as checking smartphones for lists of returning soldiers rarely jar or feel gimmicky. There are lovely touches barely related to the makeover: Benedick and Claudio must bunk down in a young girl's bedroom, all stuffed toys and Barbie hardware. There's a smoky jazz soundtrack, big on bass, sounding for all the world like an extended Seinfeld sting, which helps keep things perky.</p> <p>But Whedon's key coup is in simply directing a very good version of the play. He's got a keen ear for comedy, a no-nonsense approach to ditching the gags that don't work, a deft hand for slapstick and an eagerness to use it. Just as with this summer's surprise smash (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/144027/avengers\" title=\"\">The Avengers</a>), he assembled a crack squad of a cast, then dispatched them with purpose. The vain-glory and the self-delusion of his leads is beautifully done by both Alexis Denisof (Benedick) and Amy Acker (Beatrice); Whedon adds a one-night stand flashback that lends strange credence to their bruised egos and prickly banter.</p> <p>Much Ado may be a bit of a B+ staple on the Shakespeare circuit, but Whedon \u2013 as well as improving student grades the world over \u2013 makes it feel second to none.</p>",
  "<p>He's been to London, Barcelona and Paris and now Woody Allen has made another of his luxury-tourist stopovers in a European capital, shot in a honeyed sunset-light and recycling picturesque cliches around half a century old. This time it's Rome, and the original title was to be Bop Decameron, an allusion to Boccaccio's medieval multi-narrative tale that set up this ensemble movie. Allen was, however, persuaded that it was too abstruse, and I suspect the hopelessly dated reference to bebop was probably a bit baffling as well. The alternative, Nero Fiddles, was also rejected, so To Rome With Love it is.</p> <p>Allen is no stranger to Italy and Italians: in Play It Again, Sam (1972), his film critic Allan comes out of the portmanteau film Le Coppie, or Couples, by De Sica and others \u2013 and then fantasises about jealous husband Tony Roberts going for him with a knife, as if in a spoof Italian movie. There was also a brilliant Antonioni pastiche in Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Sex (1972), and his Stardust Memories (1980) was famously a homage to Fellini. To Rome With Love has nothing of this stylishly offbeat connoisseurship. Everything is pretty much on the nose. This film is far from the greatness of earlier years, although it sometimes has a cantering gaiety and sense of farcical fun.</p> <p>We begin with a vision of one of those stately and pompous-looking Roman policemen who direct the traffic in pristine white gloves and white helmet. Perhaps in the back of Allen's mind was the famous 1960s Candid Camera stunt; hidden-camera footage of flamboyant traffic cops from around the world was set to appropriate music and the Roman officer had a ripe classical score. He is to be the narrator, introducing us to all the stories happening in the city. Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi) and Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi) are naive newlyweds who have come to town to meet Antonio's family, but he winds up having to pass off a quaintly imagined voluptuous prostitute called Anna as his bride. This is Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, straightforwardly playing Sophia Loren.</p> <p>Hayley (Alison Pill) is a visiting student who falls in love with handsome young local Michelangelo (Flavio Parenti); her parents fly in to meet him, and they are Phyllis and Jerry, played by Judy Davis and Allen himself. He is a retired opera director who is astonished by Michelangelo's father, a mortician who appears to have a superb singing voice. Meanwhile, nervy, nerdy architecture student Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) falls in love with self-centred wannabe-screen star Monica (Ellen Page). Successful American architect John (Alec Baldwin) sees much of his vulnerable younger self in Jack, then becomes the fantasy voice in Jack's head, warning him that this woman is trouble. He is very like the imaginary Bogart in Play It Again Sam, or indeed the worldly Tony Roberts. Lastly, there is Roberto Benigni playing&#xa0;Leopoldo, the ordinary guy who to his dismay is capriciously taken&#xa0;up as a celebrity by the febrile and vacuous media.</p> <p>Now that Allen's prospects of a May-to-September love affair on screen are not viable, the trope of the older or retired couple coming into town to meet the prospective son- or daughter-in-law, or just on vacation, wandering at will, is as good a way as any of positioning Allen and anyone from the older generation into a live romantic situation \u2013 or at any rate in parallel with that situation. There is some fun to be had with all the discomfiture and unease; but some of the jokes and situations simply don't work. There is nothing comparable to the time-travel device in Midnight in Paris that made comic and ironic sense of the nostalgia and tourist incomprehension.</p> <p>This is not to say that there aren't shrewd touches. Benigni's performance is actually reasonably watchable \u2013 incredible as that sounds \u2013 and his story is handled far more lightly than in recent movies by Xavier Giannoli and Matteo Garrone on the same theme. Leopoldo's chauffeur tells him that everyone has to endure the same sorrow in this world, celebrities and non-celebrities alike, so it is of course better to be a celebrity. That's a refreshingly honest moral to draw. Baldwin has some brilliant moments as he icily dismisses Monica's posturing: his final closeup \u2013 heavy-lidded, undeceived \u2013 is&#xa0;fascinating and rather&#xa0;chilling.</p> <p>Loyal Allen fans will know the minute-by-minute tension of watching his recent movies: the relief of registering a successful gag, and the occasional wash of melancholy at the recurring thought that one day there will be no more new Woody Allen movies. It gives these films an audience frisson to be had nowhere else. But there is of course another picture in the works, and the sudden success of Midnight in Paris proved that this unique film-maker may continue to surprise us all.</p>",

In The Testament of Mary, the author of Mothers and Sons turns his attention to the most famous pair in western history. Angry and grieving, and now in exile, Mary tries to piece together her memories of the events that led to the crucifixion of her son. As her life and suffering are transformed into myth, Toibin's Mary remains furious with Jesus's disciples and is unwilling to participate in the version of history being drawn by the gospel writers. To her he remains a vulnerable figure, surrounded by men who could not be trusted, living in a time of turmoil and change. </p> <p>The Testament of Mary is published on 25 October (RRP \u00a312.99).

  "<p>This week's playlist has been selected by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/beltwaybandit\">Beltway Bandit</a>.</p> <p>It's an odd paradox that so many musicians willingly embrace branded products yet remain hostile to the marketing processes behind them. U2, that most commercially aware of bands, start the playlist with their soaring Cyberpunk inspired epic Zooropa, an imagined dialogue consisting mostly of advertising slogans, set in a city dominated by neon signs, perhaps suggesting that the meaningless phrases have replaced the old certainties that once gave us all a sense of direction and purpose. A more direct critique of advertising comes from Adam Freeland in We Want Your Soul, a blistering attack on the control that the marketing industry exercises over every aspect of our lives whilst telling us that we are free.

  "<p>As scientist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Diamond\" title=\"\">Jared Diamond</a> has made clear, it is most often lack of water that brings kingdoms to their ends. The ancient Jordanian city of Petra stands as a reminder that civilisations cannot easily withstand desertification. The medieval textile producers and traders of Bruges did not know that the greatest threat to their business came not from Florence or Antwerp, but from the falling water levels in the river Zwin, a threat they were powerless to halt. Can businesses now do better than the burghers of Bruges or the treasurers of Petra?</p> <p>Throughout the hottest North American summer in memory and the worst drought in 56 years, industries from shipping, food production, manufacturing and insurance have lost money, products, customers and access to markets.</p> <p>Some of these losses have been in industries where we expect to see an impact. The drought has threatened the livelihood of Midwest farmers, whose corn and soybean crops have been devastated. Bloomberg reports that yields in Ohio are expected to be lower than normal by 29% (corn) and 12% (soy). Purdue University predicts that Indiana will see its worst corn and soybean yields in the past 75 years.</p> <p>The precipitous rise in the cost of corn has had less obvious results as well. The nascent US ethanol industry faces <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444082904577605763027744608.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\">calls to waive</a> the regulatory supports that mandate the use of corn for fuel. The drought is already having an impact on the retail food industry. <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/issie-lapowsky/drought-threatens-small-businesses.html\">Magnolia</a>, a cupcake bakery chain in New York City that does not use corn, faces far higher costs for its wheat flour and for trucking its supplies. Unfortunately, the drought has not increased the amount its customers' are willing to pay.</p> <p>Perhaps the most dramatic consequence of this drought is the failure of the most important inland shipping route in the United States.</p> <p>The Mississippi River has dropped 3.6 metres (12 feet). The water level is so low that sections are now impassable for the barges that for decades have moved ore, manufactured goods and crops from the central USA to the Gulf of Mexico to be shipped to markets throughout the world.</p> <p>On 20 August, 97 vessels were stranded near Greenville, Mississippi. Shippers are losing tens of thousands of dollars as their vessels remain stranded. According to the American Waterways Operators, 566 million tons of goods are shipped on the river annually. Barges haul $180bn worth of goods. To keep traffic (and the US economy) moving, the coastguard is directing barges through the reduced stream, and the Army Corps of Engineers is dredging critical channels.</p> <p>Manufacturers have depended on the Mississippi for generations. For now, the barges are likely to get through \u2013 though carrying less, costing more and moving achingly slowly. But there is more risk and less certainty than there was a year ago. Such risks demand costly redundancies in systems and reduce the margins within which businesses must operate.</p> <p>Companies deal with unmanageable risk by buying insurance, and insurance companies buy reinsurance. The scale of this year's drought damage has overwhelmed them, too. Crop insurers stand to lose more than $5bn because they underestimated the risks of such a massive failure. Reinsurers are affected, too: Munich Re recently announced that it had lost nearly $200m because of the drought.</p> <p>Sustainable businesses have attempted to mitigate their long-term risk by implementing conservation measures, closed loop operations and more accountable sourcing of raw materials. But these aren't answers to sudden environmental change. Our supply chain-based models of sustainable business are most useful when the degradation of the environment is measurable, predictable and observable. We are learning to find new and better suppliers and to convince our customers of the value of more sustainable inputs. But little of this is valuable when the building blocks of commerce, such as roads, rivers and electrical power, become unstable and uncertain.</p> <p>Managers cannot always look outside the box in order to prepare for threats; there is simply too little extra time to worry about century storms and disastrous droughts. After the political failures of climate change conferences in Copenhagen, Johannesburg and Rio, world leaders have urged business to collaborate with other sectors to reduce the threat of global warming. The partnerships they advocated among thinktanks, environmental NGOs and industry associations can help businesses anticipate Black Swan events, and to think the unthinkable.</p> <p>Such initiatives are already underway. For instance, a number of large companies have partnered with the World Resources Institute to create the <a href=\"http://insights.wri.org/aqueduct/welcome\">Aqueducts project</a>, a water risk-management tool. By working with government data and the WRI's scientists, these companies have helped make useful forecasts widely available. These consortiums have yet to address the risk of catastrophic or sudden change.</p> <p>Sustainable businesses might be able to reduce their footprint, pilot better technologies, or bring fair trade commodities to broader markets. But to remain sustainable, they must also stay in business when rivers silt up. To carry on, businesses will need to work with their partners both to assess risks and to prevent future harm. Together with their partners, businesses can identify and advocate for policies to mitigate new risks. It may no longer be enough to be responsible purchasers and careful risk managers. Businesses and their partners may need to look at mitigating large, systemic risks, such as the impact of climate change on shipping and agriculture.</p> <p>No longer can we imagine that we live in a world in which the only victims of environmental damage are rare owls, subsistence farmers and island nations. This summer, we have discovered that not only the richest farmers but the biggest manufacturers in the US are vulnerable to drought risks. Firms identified with sustainability will assume a bigger role in society's discourse about environmental decline. We must not imagine we are powerless to stop it.</p> <p><em>Alison Kemper teaches management at York University and has worked with the Michael Lee-Chin Institute for Corporate Citizenship at the Rotman School since 2005.

  "<p>\"You equate retirement with death,\" Woody Allen's character is informed, by his psychiatrist wife, in the opening minutes of his new comedy <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIbYqxqtP38\" title=\"\">To Rome With Love</a>. The line is blatant self-diagnosis on Allen's part. In December, the director will turn 77 \u2013 well past the point at which \"death enters your basic timeframe\", as he puts it \u2013 and this morning finds him in his editing suite on Park Lane, Manhattan, dressed in khaki slacks and khaki shirt, toiling hard to keep the reaper at bay. In a week or two, he'll finish shooting his 2013 movie, which doesn't yet have a title; then, while he edits that, he'll start mulling ideas for 2014's, poring over the scraps of paper on which he scribbles stray thoughts and keeps in a drawer. Outside, New York is oppressively humid, but thanks to air-conditioning and a total lack of windows, Allen's workspace is a chilly cavern. (\"I have an intense desire to return to the womb \u2013 anybody's,\" he once told Time.) Against the dark carpet, dark walls and dark furniture, Allen stands out: a small, beige presence, labouring.</p> <p>A surprisingly persistent misconception, to this day, is that the real Woody Allen must be broadly the same as his movie persona: the fretful <em>nebbish</em>, plagued by hypochondria, beset by existential terrors, anxious to the point of paralysis. But that Woody Allen, of course, could never have written and directed at least one feature film a year, as he has done, with only two exceptions, since 1966. The offscreen Allen exudes single-mindedness of purpose; he's guardedly friendly, and these days a little deaf. The hypochondria part is real enough, though \u2013 as is the fretting. The movie he's wrapping up now \u2013 a \"serious drama\" set in San Francisco, starring Cate Blanchett \u2013 is proving a disappointment, he says. But that's always the way.</p> <p>\"I have an idea for a story, and I think to myself, my God, this is a combination of Eugene O'Neill, and Tennessee Williams, and Arthur Miller \u2026 but that's because [when you're writing] you don't have to face the test of reality. You're at home, in your house, it's all in your mind. Now, when it's almost over, and I see what I've got, I start to think: what have I done? This is going to be such an embarrassment! Can I salvage it? All your grandiose ideas go out the window. You realise you made a catastrophe, and you think: what if I put the last scene first, drop this character, put in narration? What if I shoot one more scene, to make him not leave his wife, but kill his wife?\" These fusillades of self-criticism, you sense, aren't false modesty, nor real terror, but something else: the musings of a veteran who has long since come to terms with the fact that his creative process will always be a long slide into disillusionment. Nine times out of ten, he says, when he leaves the screening of the first rough cut: \"The feeling is: OK, now don't panic.\" The other 10% of the time, it's: \"OK. That's not as bad as I thought.\"</p> <p>You needn't undergo 37 years of psychoanalysis, as Allen has, to see that all this activity fulfils a therapeutic function. Every few movies, it throws up a gem, too. Last year's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/oct/06/midnight-in-paris-film-review\" title=\"\">Midnight In Paris</a> was Allen's best in years: a purely entertaining fantasy in which Owen Wilson, playing a Hollywood screenwriter on holiday in France, is transported, via a time-travelling Peugeot, to the Paris of the 1920s, where he receives relationship advice from Ernest Hemingway and editorial tips from Gertrude Stein. (For Wilson's character, who romanticises that era, it's a dream come true \u2013 but the Parisians of the 20s are themselves nostalgic for the 1890s. That's the problem with longing for the past, Allen is saying: we long for it because it's the past.) The film became Allen's highest-grossing in North America ever, outstripping Hannah and Her Sisters. Even the French loved it, which isn't how things usually go with Allen's late-period Euro movies: British reviewers gave the otherwise acclaimed Match Point a chilly reception, while the Spanish hated Vicky Cristina Barcelona. But then Allen has always been loved by the French, who, he once said, make two mistakes about him: \"They think I'm an intellectual because I wear these glasses, and they think I'm an artist because my films lose money.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396096455\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347538809083/Woody-Allen-directing--010.jpg\" alt=\"Woody Allen directing \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Woody Allen directing Flavio Parenti and Alison PIll in To Rome With Love. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To Rome With Love, unfortunately, embodies the other result of Allen's shoot-it-and-move-on approach. Trundling on a cheesy tourist trail around the Italian capital (the Trevi fountain, the Spanish Steps), it tells four whimsical stories that never intersect, meaning that its most watchable stars \u2013 Alec Baldwin, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Roberto Benigni and Allen, appearing in one of his movies for the first time since Scoop, in 2006 \u2013 never interact. Benigni, for example, plays a Roman office worker who leaves home one morning to find himself inexplicably hounded by paparazzi; the funniest scenes involve Allen, as a retired opera director, discovering that his daughter's Italian fiance's father has the ability to sing like a world-class tenor, but only in the shower. A tour of opera houses follows, featuring a shower cubicle on stage. But none of it really goes anywhere. The film, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/06/to-rome-with-love-and-exhaustion/259151/\" title=\"\">as Christopher Orr wrote in the Atlantic</a>, has \"a tossed-off, rough-draft quality \u2026 it's as if Allen had a handful of early ideas kicking around, couldn't settle on any one of them, saw his psychological nuclear-countdown clock ticking toward the one-year mark, and threw together what he had.\" The film-a-year schedule, Orr wrote, \"increasingly seems less a choice than a compulsion\" \u2013 a reading with which, meeting Allen, it's hard to disagree.</p> <p>Given the picture's claim to be a love-letter to Rome, did it bother Allen that Italian critics argued that it showed Rome through the eyes of an outsider \u2013 and a pampered celebrity outsider, familiar only with its five-star hotels, at that? \"My experience has been, with one exception [Midnight In Paris], that when I do a film in a foreign country, the toughest audience for me is that country,\" he says. \"In Italy, they said: 'This guy doesn't understand Italy.' And I can't argue with those criticisms. I'm an American, and that's how I see Barcelona or Rome or England \u2026 If the situation was reversed, and somebody from a foreign country made a film here, I might very well be saying: 'Yeah, it's OK, but this guy really doesn't get New York.' And I'd be right. And I'm sure they're right.\"</p> <p>It's a curious truth, though, as Allen points out, that his movies \u2013 even the New York classics, pre-eminently Manhattan, in which he starred alongside Diane Keaton in 1977 \u2013 have always been outsider's views to some degree. Born Allan Stewart Konigsberg in Brooklyn in 1935, the son of a jewellery engraver and a deli worker, \"my view of Manhattan was largely gleaned from Hollywood movies,\" he says. \"Where I grew up, we didn't have sophisticated penthouses. Nobody mixed martinis or popped champagne corks or had white telephones. These things were only in Hollywood movies.\"</p> <p>Perhaps it's because Allen is, these days, a pampered celebrity \u2013 \"everything is done for you by minions,\" he says of the film-making process \u2013 that celebrity is the one subject on which To Rome With Love feels authentic and personal. He has been here before, most obviously in 1998's Celebrity, but in the new film he seems far more reconciled to life in the public eye. When Benigni's character's fame evaporates as suddenly as it arrived, he misses it badly. Allen's message, such as it is \u2013 and to non-fans, it will doubtless seem a little smug \u2013 is that wealth and fame are pretty fun. \"There are lots of nice advantages that you get, being a celebrity,\" he says. \"The tabloid things, the bumps in the road, they come and they go. Most people don't have as big a bump as I had, but even the big bump \u2013 it's not life-threatening. It's not like the doctor's saying: 'I looked at these x-rays of your brain, and there's this little thing growing there.' Tabloid things can be handled. I just don't want a shadow on my lung on the x-ray.\"</p> <p>The bump to which he is referring, of course, is the scandal that for some people overshadows all his achievements before or since: his split in 1992 from Mia Farrow, after she discovered naked photos he had taken of Farrow's adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn, then aged 20, whom Allen subsequently married. There followed a long and acrimonious battle for custody of Farrow and Allen's three children, which Allen lost. (Allen was never Previn's legal father.) Two decades later, there's little more to be said about it. Either you side with the still-seething Farrow camp \u2013 \"happy father's day, or as they call it in my family, happy brother-in-law's day,\" Allen's estranged son Ronan Farrow tweeted earlier this year \u2013 or you buy Previn's argument that Allen was \"never any kind of father figure to me\", in which case it's just another May-to-December movie-world marriage. By all accounts, the Allen/Previn union is a tranquil one; the couple have two adopted children, reportedly aged 12 and 14. (Soon-Yi, Allen maintains, still hasn't seen most of his earlier movies, though it's unclear if this is through lack of interest or an aversion to exploring her husband's earlier romances.) Does it bother him, I ask, that for a sizeable minority of his audience, the scandal still defines him? \"I think that's true,\" he says, thoughtfully. \"To have been the lead character in a juicy scandal \u2013 a really juicy scandal \u2013 that will always be a part of what people think of when they think of me. It doesn't bother me. It doesn't please me. It's a non-factor. But it's a&#xa0;true&#xa0;factor.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396096456\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347539037845/2011-MIDNIGHT-IN-PARIS-010.jpg\" alt=\"2011, MIDNIGHT IN PARIS\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams in Midnight in Paris, Woody Allen's biggest American hit. Photograph: Sony Pictures Classics/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sony Pictures Classics/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What preys on his mind infinitely more \u2013 this won't come as a surprise \u2013 is ageing. In one sense, this is nothing new: Allen has been confronting the horror of mortality, he says, since he was five, which means that by the time he wrote the part of the death-obsessed Alvy Singer in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/36314/annie.hall\" title=\"\">Annie Hall</a>, back in 1977, he had already been worrying for 37 years. Now actually getting older, though, he finds grim satisfaction in being proved right: \"It's a bad business. It's a confirmation that the anxieties and terrors I've had all my life were accurate. There's no advantage to ageing. You don't get wiser, you don't get more mellow, you don't see life in a more glowing way. You have to fight your body decaying, and you have less options.\" In 46 years as a director, he hasn't budged on his position that there's only one response: watch a basketball game, play the clarinet. \"The only thing you can do is what you did when you were 20 \u2013 because you're always walking with an abyss right under your feet; they can be hoisting a piano on Park Avenue and drop it on your head when you're 20 \u2013 which is to distract yourself. Getting involved in a movie [occupies] all my anxiety: did I write a good scene for Cate Blanchett? If I wasn't concentrated on that, I'd be thinking of larger issues. And those are unresolvable, and you're checkmated whichever way you go.\"</p> <p>Plus, he adds, leaning forward: \"If you're a celebrity, you can get good medical treatment. I can get a doctor on the weekends. I can get the results of my biopsy quickly.\"</p> <p>He doesn't envisage ever stopping making films. \"But this can be taken out of my hands in a number of sinister ways.\" These relate to health, but also to money: the real explanation for Allen's recent filmic tour of European capitals has been the willingness of British, Spanish and Italian funders to step in where US studios won't. \"You'd think that after a hit like Midnight in Paris \u2013 made a lot of money, not by Dark Knight standards, but by my standards \u2013 there would be some companies that would want to do a film with you. But I didn't get a single offer. Not one \u2026 and then an Italian company I'd been talking to for years was willing to put up money.\" Soon-Yi, he says, has been \"bothering me relentlessly\" to travel to south-east Asia; he'd make a film anywhere, he says, providing he could find the right idea.</p> <p>Allen still holds, as he's often done, that he's never made a \"great\" film, though it no longer seems to trouble him. \"I'm just trying to be objective and honest,\" he says. \"If you were having a 10-film festival and showing Citizen Kane on Monday, Rashomon on Tuesday, The Bicycle Thief, The Seventh Seal \u2026 I don't think anything I've ever made could be placed in a festival with those films and hold its own.\" If he's exercising on the treadmill and Annie Hall or Take the Money and Run comes on the TV, he says, he switches channel instantly; the same even applies to his personal favourites, The Purple Rose of Cairo and Husbands and Wives. \"More than likely, if I stopped to watch it, I'd think: 'Oh, God, can I buy that back?'\"</p> <p>Now and then, an exasperated critic will demand Allen's retirement, as if it's somehow an offence against cinema to keep making films that don't, on the whole, measure up to his earlier triumphs. But they misunderstand his motivation. \"Making films is a very nice way to make a living,\" he says. \"You work with beautiful women, and charming men, who are amusing and gifted; you work with art directors and costume people \u2026 you travel places, and the money's good. It's a nice living.\" And the perfect distraction from the abyss. As long as you have the means to keep going, why would you stop?</p>",

During the July election, ballots were counted at the headquarters of Benghazi's strongest militia.</p> <p>\"The strategy of trying to dismantle the regional militias while simultaneously making use of them as hired guns might be sowing the seeds for the country's descent into warlordism,\" the Carnegie Endowment's <a href=\"http://carnegieendowment.org/2012/07/15/libya-s-militia-menace/csdq\" title=\"\">Frederic Wehrey warned in a recent article</a>.</p> <p>Little is known about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/13/chris-stevens-libya-brutal-death\" title=\"\">Ansar al-Sharia group in Benghazi</a>, which was reported to have demonstrated at the US consulate over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/12/muhammad-film-reaction-middle-east\" title=\"\">offensive film about the prophet Muhammad</a>, though it claimed it took part in a \"spontaneous popular uprising\". Its symbols are a Qur'an and a Kalashnikov, hinting at its Salafi-jihadi ideology. But it denied targeting the US ambassador.</p> <p>\"This is not sustainable,\" said Robert Malley of the International Crisis Group (ICG), whose new report on Libya highlights the challenges ahead. \"The new government needs to take concrete steps to reform its security forces and establish structures of a functioning state. Anything less will perpetuate what already is in place: local disputes \u2026 in a fragmented and heavily armed landscape.\"</p> <p>Shagour has said that security is his number one priority but linked this to the need to create jobs for young people.</p> <p>Pressure from the US and European allies such as Britain is certain to increase in the wake of the Benghazi attack. Only two days after the storming of Gaddafi's compound in Tripoli last August, Hillary Clinton called on the National Transitional Council to take \"a firm stand against violent extremists\" \u2013 meaning Islamists.</p> <p>The Benghazi killing, the ICG now says, must serve as \"wakeup call\" for Shaghour and colleagues. \"There is much to celebrate in post-Gaddafi Libya but also reason to worry,\" the report argues. \"The battle between central government and armed groups is not yet won, yet of late the latter have been acting as if they enjoyed the upper hand. If steps are not swiftly taken, reversing this trend is only going to get harder \u2013 and what has been a relatively good news story could turn depressingly sour. Precipitous moves against the armed groups are likely to fail and backfire. But time is running out, the government is plagued by inertia, and the need for across-the-board reforms of the military and police is more urgent than ever.\"</p>",
  "<p>In 2008, the <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/killianprettyfinal\" title=\"\">Killian Pretty review of planning applications</a> recommended that local planning authorities should \"no longer be required to publish notices in newspapers\". This would both improve effectiveness of \"discussions and involvement of the local community\" and give authorities flexibility to spend money \"in the way they see fit to best engage their local communities\".</p> <p>These proposals were not taken forward. But it is clear that while technology has advanced, offering more options for placing public notices and at cheaper cost, the legislation that requires councils to produce and publish public notices hasn't.</p> <p>Councils spend up to \u00a367.85m every year publishing public notices in local newspapers, according to an estimate by the Local Government Association. The individual cost of publishing a notice can reach over \u00a320 per column cm in some publications, upwards of three times the cost for other adverts. This is resulting in a weighty burden on councils.</p> <p>Local authorities are crying out for change. We surveyed 110 councils for <a href=\"http://www.lgiu.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Public-notices-The-case-for-radical-reform-part-1.pdf\" title=\"\">our recent report on the issue</a> and found more than 90% of respondents want the legal requirements reformed. One commented that current standards \"are an out-of-date anachronism of a pre-electronic age\". The head of communications at Brighton &amp; Hove said they were a \"total waste of public money\".</p> <p>There has been a distinct lack of engagement on the issue from the Department for Communities and Local Government, despite it being aware that councils want printed publishing requirements to be changed and cost savings to be made.</p> <p>A 2007 government report into how the public sector could take a lead in adapting to new communications technologies recommended that public information should be made available cost-effectively, or ideally at marginal cost, and that publishing technologies had overtaken the requirements of most legislation.</p> <p>Despite this, requirements on public notices did not form part of the government's last publicity code consultation. The guidance, published in February 2011, did not discuss public notices.</p> <p>In terms of cost and time effectiveness, the success of reaching and engaging an audience and assessing feedback, the vast majority of residents rated the current system as bad or very bad. It is clear that councils are not getting value for their money.</p> <p>LGiU wants to see a mixture of subtle and radical change:</p> <p>\u2022 Councils should be free to decide where it is best to place public notices.</p> <p>\u2022 More work needs to be done to de-jargon and standardise the content of public notices.</p> <p>\u2022 Councils who do publish notices online should offer users a email subscription service, allowing uses to opt-in to receive public notices.</p> <p>\u2022 Hyperlocal, neighbourhood websites, as well as traditional local media news sites, should be encouraged to carry feeds of council notices.</p> <p>The government should also look into the possibility of supporting the development of a central online portal for publishing public notices.</p> <p>There is not, and should not be, a one-size-fits-all solution to this problem. Councils want the freedom to decide where is best to place public notices. Some may choose to go online only, others to continue publishing in local publications. Some may print more <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2012/jul/03/council-run-newspapers-eric-pickles\" title=\"\">'town hall pravdas' as communities secretary Eric Pickles describes them</a>.</p> <p>One participant in our survey mentioned they were looking at what new local TV might offer. The choice though, should be up to councils.</p> <p>What impact would changing the system have? We can transform the way councils think of public notices, from being a chore and a cost, to a communication point that adds value to the council's engagement and <a href=\"http://www.socitmconsulting.co.uk/page/primary-links/channel-shift\" title=\"\">channel shift</a> strategies.</p> <p>We also want to see a greater involvement of hyperlocal and community forums in the sharing of these notices. As <a href=\"http://networkedneighbourhoods.com/\" title=\"\">Networked Neighbourhoods</a> have shown, more and more people are using these citizen-led sites to find local information.</p> <p>And what for the local press? These changes would have a big impact on local papers \u2013 \u00a367.85m is a significant contribution to commercial newspaper industry's turnover. There is no doubt that a vibrant, local media is vital to the democratic process, but the current trend invites some hard questions about value for money.</p> <p><em>Rob Dale leads on online engagement and communications at the </em><a href=\"http://www.lgiu.org.uk/#\" title=\"\"><em>Local Government Information Unit</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and </strong><a href=\"http://localgovernmentjobs.guardian.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>the latest vacancies</strong></a><strong> in your area</strong></p>",

If you're yet to, I'd strongly recommend it. Here's a brief rundown of the changes we've made in this update.</p> <h2>The world's oldest Sunday newspaper, on one of the world's most exciting modern platforms</h2> <p>One of the most asked-for additions to the app has been an option to get the Observer on Sundays. Considering that the app's name has changed to the \"Guardian and Observer iPad edition\", and changes to the splash-screen and title bar, you can probably guess what the teams here have been working very hard on over the past couple of months. I'm really happy to say that from 16th September, in addition to the Monday-Saturday issues of the Guardian, on Sundays the app will now include an Observer issue, featuring the main news section of The Observer, the New Review, the sport section and the Observer Magazine. The Observer Food Magazine isn't in the app at the moment but we are looking at how we might include it in future.</p> <p>To coincide with the launch, we're giving everyone with the iPad edition, including current subscribers and even those whose subscriptions have lapsed, two free issues of the Observer this Sunday (16th September) and next (23rd September). They'll automatically appear in the app like weekday issues do. </p> <h2>Design and usability changes</h2> <p>We've also taken the opportunity to make some changes to the user-experience in the app. These clean up the user-flows and make using it more consistent, both internally and with other apps. </p> <p><strong>Where has my 'Issues' button gone?</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396161590\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347537873057/Observer-home.jpg\" alt=\"Observer home\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When you're in an issue, you used to press 'Issues' on the right to take you to the home-screen where you can select a paper to read. Now when you're on a section-page in any issue, there's a home-button on the top-left that does this. </p> <p>If you're in an article, touch the 'close' button on the top-left and you'll be able to get to the home button. This means that, no matter where you are in the app, you can touch a button on the top-left to take you back one step - either to a section-page, or to the issue picker.</p> <p><strong>Sections</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396161591\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347537873256/Observer-menu.jpg\" alt=\"Observer menu\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The sections list can still be accessed from the same place, in the top-right hand corner when you're in an issue, but it's now a button which looks like three horizontal lines. You can use this to jump to any section within an issue. </p> <p><strong>Settings</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396161592\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347537873507/Observer-settings.jpg\" alt=\"Observer settings\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>To avoid confusion, we've moved the settings button. You can find it on the top-right of the homescreen (where you pick an issue to read). It looks like a cog. </p> <p>As always, you can use the settings to get hints about how to use the app, check and edit your subscription options, contact us, and check our privacy policy and terms and conditions. </p> <p><strong>New interactive ads</strong></p> <p>As with the previous versions of the app, we're really happy to have Channel 4 on board as sponsor. We feel that their new in-app programme information is a great addition to the experience. </p> <h2>New subscription options</h2> <p>As mentioned above, we're giving the next two issues of The Observer free to all users of the app. After that, monthly subscriptions for the full 7-day offer will be available for \u00a311.99. Current subscribers are able to buy an upgrade subscription of only \u00a31.99 per month to continue to access Sunday issues. This is a saving of over 25% compared to separate Guardian and Observer digital subscriptions. </p> <p>As you'd expect, anyone can remain on \u00a39.99 per month to continue to access the Guardian Monday-Saturday, or pay \u00a36.99 per month for The Observer alone. Access to the app is also included in our range of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/subscribe\">combined print and digital subscriptions</a>.</p> <h2>Feedback</h2> <p>We're constantly working to make our apps better, be that by refining interfaces, trying our hardest to fix bugs, or getting more great content into them. I really hope that you like these changes, and that you enjoy some fantastic new Sunday content in the near future.</p> <p>As always, comments are welcome below or contact us via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianmobile\">@guardianmobile</a> on Twitter.</p>",
  "<p>The British cyclist who discovered the victims of the French Alps murders has described how he found a little girl \"stumbling\" around, bleeding and \"moaning\".</p> <p>Brett Martin said he initially believed there had been a terrible accident as he surveyed the horrific scene in the secluded car park close to Lake Annecy.</p> <p>The BMW's engine was still revving and its wheels were spinning. Inside were the bodies of the engineer Saad al-Hilli, 50, his dentist wife, Iqbal, 47, and her mother. The couple's four-year-old daughter, Zeena, lay undiscovered under her mother's corpse for eight hours afterwards, while her seven-year-old sister, Zainab, was the girl found outside the car.</p> <p>Martin, from West Sussex, a former RAF and British Airways pilot who is now a pilot instructor, was speaking as French investigators said they believed the key to the motive behind the murders lay in the UK \"without doubt\".</p> <p>Martin, who was visiting his family's rental property in the area and out on his daily cycle ride, described the scene of carnage, in the Combe d'Ire forest, near Chevaline, as though it was from a Hollywood film.</p> <p>\"There was a lot of blood and heads with bullet holes in them,\" he said. \"It was the sort of thing you would never in your life expect to come across.\"</p> <p>\"As I approached the scene, the first thing I saw was a bike on its side. I had seen the cyclist ahead of me much earlier so I thought he was just having a rest.</p> <p>\"As I got a little bit closer, a very young child stumbled out on to the road and at first I thought she was actually just playing with her sibling because she sort of looked, from a distance, like she was falling over, larking about like a child would.</p> <p>\"However, as I approached her it was obvious that she was quite badly injured and there was a lot of blood on her.</p> <p>\"As I got even closer, I then saw the car with its engine revving and its wheels spinning. It seemed at that moment in time like there had been a terrible car accident.\"</p> <p>He went first to the girl, Zainab. \"She was prone on the road, moaning, semi-conscious and she was lying in a position that was in front of this car with its wheel spinning. So my immediate thought was she needed to be moved in case the car lurched forward and ran her over. So I gently attended to her and moved her into a position clear of where the vehicle could possibly go, clear of the road, and put her in the recovery position as best I could, and asked her to stay there. And then moved on.</p> <p>\"She was very severely injured, she was going in and out of consciousness. After a few minutes, she had become unconscious. She had quite a lot of blood and some very obvious head injuries.\"</p> <p>At first he believed there had been an accident between a cyclist and the car, because there was a cyclist on the ground more or less in front of the car. \"But there were things that didn't quite match, because the cycle wasn't beside him, and he wasn't grazed.\"</p> <p>\"As the minutes went on I started to change my opinion about whether it was a car accident.\"</p> <p>There was nothing he could do for those in the car, he said: \"What struck me was their complete inanimate nature, which is how I assessed, without breaking into the car and physically handling them, that they were dead.\"</p> <p>He switched off the car engine, then realised he had no mobile signal. He realised he would have to leave Zainab to get help.</p> <p>\"It was a dilemma. One choice was to leave her, and another was to take her with me. She was very light, so I could have done a fireman's lift and take her down to my bike. But she had a lot of injuries, and it seemed if there was a risk of internal bleeding, wounds, then dragging her like a rag doll on my shoulder might have perhaps killed her. The prudent decision was to leave her in the recovery position and go for help on my bike as fast as I could.\"</p> <p>Leaving her \"was not a very comfortable decision to have to make\", he said.</p> <p>He did not see Zeena and had \"no inkling\" she was there, and was not surprised police did not find her for some hours. \"Unless you were to open that car and look in, the way the bodies in the rear were slumped, it doesn't surprise me in the least. I can see why you wouldn't want to go into the car for forensic reasons and there would be no other reason to go in there other than to move bodies.\"</p> <p>The French prosecutor Eric Maillaud arrived in Surrey on Thursday with the French examining magistrate Michel Mollin and both are expected to visit the Hilli family home in Claygate during their 24-hour visit. Maillaud told reporters of the motive: \"Without any doubt the reason and the causes have their origin in this country.\"</p> <p>His comments would appear to rule out robbery or carjacking. It also dispelled speculation that the French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, 45, apparently shot because he stumbled on the scene, may have been the original target.</p> <p>Forty French police officers are working on the complex case with investigators focusing on three specific areas \u2013 Hilli's work, his family and his native Iraq \u2013 as they try to find a motive for the murders.</p> <p>Maillaud said a number of witnesses had come forward in Annecy. They include a hiker, named only as Philippe D, 41, who likened the carnage to a horrific film scene.</p> <p>Sources said the victims were likely to have been shot with the same gun, fuelling speculation that they were targeted by a contract killer. Each person was shot twice in the head.</p> <p>Detailed ballistic analysis of 25 spent cartridges found at the scene suggests they all came from a 7.65mm automatic pistol.</p> <p>The gun has been described as an old-fashioned weapon but one that is still sometimes used by special forces.</p> <p>The victims' bodies have been returned to their families.</p>",
  "<p>A senior police officer who was involved in the Hillsborough operation has rejected calls from victims' families to resign, saying he has nothing to hide.</p> <p>Sir Norman Bettison, the chief constable of West Yorkshire police, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/13/hillsborough-report-norman-bettison-statement\" title=\"\">released a detailed statement outlining his belief that he had done nothing wrong</a>. Bettison was a chief inspector and later a superintendent in South Yorkshire police, and a member of the force's internal inquiry team following the disaster.</p> <p>The unit was condemned by the families of Hillsborough victims, and by the Labour MP Maria Eagle in parliament, as a black propaganda unit designed to smear the fans and shift blame from the police on to the victims.</p> <p>Trevor Hicks, whose two daughters died at Hillsborough, said Bettison should \"scurry up a drainpipe\" and resign in the aftermath of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-disaster-police-coverup-revealed\" title=\"\">the publication of the Hillsborough report on Wednesday</a>.</p> <p>The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, called for the Home Office to launch an investigation into the cover-up by South Yorkshire police and to examine whether criminal charges should be brought.</p> <p>\"The job of the police is to protect the public and to pursue justice,\" she said. \"Instead at Hillsborough, people who should have been protected were betrayed and justice was denied. The report reveals an appalling systemic cover-up, including the alteration of over 100 statements and a campaign of misinformation.</p> <p>\"People need to have confidence in the police and need to be certain that they will pursue the truth in all circumstances. Even though these events took place 23 years ago, it is important to public confidence in the integrity of police forces that these issues are taken extremely seriously and investigated.</p> <p>\"The chief constable of South Yorkshire police has rightly said that if people have broken the law then they should be prosecuted and his force would co-operate with any new inquiry.\"</p> <p>The former home secretary Jack Straw indicated on Radio 4's Today programme that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/13/norman-bettison-hillsborough-report-straw\" title=\"\">Bettison should examine his position</a>, but said any decision to go was down to the chief constable and his police authority.</p> <p>Bettison \u2013 one of the UK's most senior officers \u2013 said in a statement that he welcomed the 395-page report for endorsing his position. He made no apologies for his role in the aftermath of the Hillsborough tragedy.</p> <p>Bettison said he had always believed what the Taylor report found, that \"the disaster was caused, mainly, through a lack of police control\".</p> <p>He went on: \"Fans' behaviour, to the extent that it was relevant at all, made the job of the police, in the crush outside Leppings Lane turnstiles, harder than it needed to be. But it didn't cause the disaster any more than the sunny day that encouraged people to linger outside the stadium as kick-off approached.</p> <p>\"I held those views then, I hold them now. I have never, since hearing the Taylor evidence unfold, offered any other interpretation in public or private.</p> <p>\"In the absence of all the facts I was called upon to resign 14 years ago when I became chief constable of Merseyside,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I really welcome disclosure of all the facts that can be known about the Hillsborough tragedy because I have absolutely nothing to hide&#xa0;\u2026 Whilst not wishing to become a conducting rod for the genuine and justified hurt and anguish, I would invite anyone to do the same as me and read the document and the papers online.\"</p> <p>A former chief constable of South Yorkshire, Richard Wells, who took over in the aftermath of the disaster, said prosecutions of police officers were essential after the revelations about the scale of the cover-up in the force, which at the time was \"secretive, defensive and authoritarian\".</p> <p>Bettison denied that his role in an internal inquiry team from South Yorkshire police was to foment black propaganda and transfer blame for the tragedy on to the fans. Instead, he said, the review team was charged with \"piecing together what had taken place\".</p> <p>He made clear he had not been part of a unit which was responsible for doctoring police statements.</p> <p>\"In 1989, I was a chief inspector in a non-operational role at headquarters. Four days after the disaster (and after all the vile newspaper coverage had been written) I was one of several officers pulled together by the then deputy chief constable, Peter Hays, to support him in piecing together what had taken place at the event.</p> <p>\"By that time, the chief constable, Peter Wright, had handed over the formal investigation of the tragedy to an independent police force, West Midlands police. It was West Midlands police that presented evidence before the Taylor inquiry. The South Yorkshire deputy chief constable's team, under the leadership of Chief Superintendent Wain, was a parallel activity to inform chief officers of facts rather than rely on the speculation rampant at that time.</p> <p>\"Another team was later created&#xa0;\u2026 to work with the solicitors who were representing South Yorkshire police at the Taylor inquiry, to vet statements from South Yorkshire police officers that were intended to be presented to the inquiry&#xa0;\u2026 I never altered a statement nor asked for one to be altered. Two South Yorkshire police teams have been conflated in the minds of some commentators.\"</p> <p>Bettison said he sat through every day of the Taylor inquiry, published in August 1989, and briefed the South Yorkshire chief constable and deputy on the proceedings. \"These briefings acknowledged and accepted the responsibility of the force in the disaster. The evidence was overwhelming,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Shortly after the conclusion of the Taylor inquiry, I was posted to other duties. I had nothing further to do with the subsequent coroners' inquests and proceedings, other than occasional advice because of my knowledge of the evidence presented to the Taylor inquiry.\"</p>",
  "<p>Moves to scale back the most widely drawn counter-terrorism powers left in the police \"stop and search\" armoury have been initiated by the home secretary, Theresa May.</p> <p>An <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/about-us/consultations/schedule-7-review/\" title=\"\">official consultation</a> was launched on Thursday on the future of random \"stop and detain\" powers, which have been used by police special branch officers to question 70,000 travellers a year going through Britain's airports and ports.</p> <p>The move follows criticism from the government's own official terror laws watchdog and within Muslim communities that people from an Asian background are 42 times more likely than white people to be targeted for these random counter-terrorism interrogations.</p> <p>The national security powers, introduced under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, allow the police and immigration officers to detain any airline, ferry or train traveller for up to nine hours to determine if they are involved in terrorism.</p> <p>People can be targeted by special branch under the powers without the need for reasonable suspicion that they are involved in any crime. Those who are stopped currently have fewer rights than suspects detained at a police station; they have no access to publicly funded legal advice and failure to answer questions is a criminal offence. They can also be strip-searched and have intimate DNA samples taken from their body.</p> <p>David Anderson, the official reviewer of terrorism legislation, has highlighted the negative impact of these powers on some Muslim communities, with many of those stopped feeling they were targeted as Muslims in order to build up a profile of Muslim communities. He has described their effect as \"bubbling under the surface&#xa0;\u2026 eroding trust\".</p> <p>The Home Office consultation document published on Thursday shows that the numbers stopped under the powers have dipped in the last few years from 87,218 in 2009-10 to 69,109 in 2011-2012. The latest figures also show that 60% of those stopped are from a minority ethnic background, with 29% Asian or British Asian. This proportion rises to 45% of those who were detained. A further 47% of those detained were from a black, Chinese or other non-white background. Only 8% of those detained were white.</p> <p>A total of 2,240 people were examined for more than an hour under these powers in the last year, of whom 681 were detained, nearly all of whom had DNA samples taken. In the last three years Home Office figures show that 2.8% or about 6,440 people have been examined for more than an hour, with 42 of them held for more than six hours.</p> <p>The consultation says the options being considered include reducing the legal nine-hour detention limit, introducing a \"reasonable suspicion\" test, increasing the rights to legal advice, limiting the use of strip-searches and repealing the power to take intimate DNA samples.</p> <p>The Home Office says use of these powers directly led to about 20 prosecutions a year for terrorist-related offences between 2005 and 2009 and that a number of key individuals had been convicted as a result of a port stop.</p> <p>The home secretary said the use of these schedule 7 counter-terrorism powers formed an essential part of Britain's border security arrangements helping to protect the public from those travelling across borders to plan, finance, train for and commit terrorism.</p> <p>\"Examining people at ports and airports is necessary to protect public safety, but we want to ensure these powers are used proportionately, and are effective. This consultation seeks the views of the public to help ensure we get this right,\" said May.</p> <p>Corinna Ferguson, legal officer for the civil liberties campaigning group Liberty, said: \"This review is welcome but limited and long overdue. Like discredited stop and search powers, schedule 7 doesn't require suspicion of wrongdoing, but even worse \u2013 allows people to be detained for nine hours and have their DNA taken and property seized. Most have been non-white, causing understandable community resentment. The court of human rights will soon hear Liberty's case challenging this power \u2013 so the Home Office may have to go much further than it has today.\"</p>",
  "<p><em>I am interested in getting a media streamer that would allow access to all the catch-up TV services \u2013 BBC iPlayer, 4oD etc \u2013 plus some movie downloads such as LoveFilm. I see lots of boxes around, but none that support all the main catch-up services.</em><br><strong>Pat Sweeney</strong><br><br>Come back and ask this question in about two years and I expect I will have at least two good answers, which might be YouView and Roku. Other contenders could include Western Digital's WD TV, Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Sony's PS3, Google TV, BT Vision and a few others.</p> <p>It's confusing because the best answer could be a personal computer, a dedicated set-top box, a smart TV, a media streamer, a games console, an internet router or some other device. This should not be surprising because most of them basically consist of a processor, memory, software and perhaps a hard drive or other form of storage. They're all computers specialised for different applications, but their functions can easily overlap.</p> <p>At the moment, most people use a combination of different systems for different purposes, to suit their own preferences. Probably the simplest approach is to use a Freeview DVR (digital video recorder) for broadcast TV and for recording TV programmes, while using a PC for the internet-based stuff. This includes all the catch-up TV services, YouTube streaming, movie downloads and so on. A laptop is less than ideal for family viewing, but if both the laptop and TV set have HDMI ports, you can use the TV as an external screen.</p> <p>More serious enthusiasts tend to buy or assemble their own HTPC (home theatre PC). While it's possible to use Windows Media Center for this purpose \u2013 it was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP_editions#Media_Center_Edition\">introduced a decade ago</a> for precisely this purpose \u2013 the trend is to use an open source alternative such as <a href=\"http://xbmc.org/download/\">XBMC</a> with the <a href=\"http://plugins.tvcatchup.com/~xbmc/\">TVCatchup</a> plug-in. (TVCatchup is also <a href=\" http://plugins.tvcatchup.com/~mce/\"> available for Windows</a> and as an app for iPhone, iPad and Android.) There's also a <a href=\"http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Add-on:PleXBMC\">PleXBMC</a> plug-in.</p> <p>XBMC is available for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, iOS, Apple TV and Linux. It has even been ported to the tiny Raspberry Pi: see the CNet article, <a href=\"http://reviews.cnet.co.uk/desktops/how-to-turn-your-raspberry-pi-into-an-xbmc-media-centre-50008599/\">How to turn your Raspberry Pi into an XBMC media centre</a>. You can use a mobile phone as the remote control.</p> <p>Most consumers would probably prefer to buy a single box, or a single service, that does all they need. The services that come closest are Virgin Media cable and BT Vision, but both involve an expensive subscription. The rest often have two distinct problems. First, they might not handle all the popular movie and music formats, including MKV and FLAC. Second, as you have found, there's usually a limit to how many catch-up and streaming services a box will support. It looks as though the BBC is aiming to make its iPlayer available on every significant platform from the PC to the Wii, but some of the commercial providers are not that bothered. </p> <p>The box makers have the same problem in reverse. I expect they all want BBC iPlayer and Netflix or LoveFilm. They'd also like ITV Player, 4OD and Demand 5, if it's not too much trouble. Services such as <a href=\"http://www.nowtv.com/home\">Sky's Now TV</a>, <a href=\"http://www.blinkbox.com/\">BlinkBox</a>, YouTube, Shoutcast, Spotify and Last FM are probably further down the list. </p> <p>Also, bear in mind that suppliers such as Roku and Western Digital are selling streaming media players in dozens of countries, not just in the UK. It would be a huge task for them to support all the local TV services.</p> <p>The obvious solution would be for the main British content providers, including all the TV stations and the major ISPs, to get together and offer a common services platform. That way, the box makers would only have to provide one application to access dozens of different services. The TV content providers would benefit from not having to support dozens of incompatible boxes (including the ones from Microsoft, Apple and Google), many of which have small audiences and limited lifespans. So far, their best effort has been the long-delayed <a href=\"http://www.youview.com/\">YouView</a> project. This started at the BBC as Kangaroo (blocked by the Competition Commission for being \"too powerful\") and continued through <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8424677.stm\">Project Canvas</a> to YouView.</p> <p>Today's YouView box, the \u00a3299 Humax DTR-1000T, plugs into your TV set and takes Freeview an important step further. The idea is that just as you can use Freeview's EPG (electronic programme guide) to look through future television programmes, you should also be able to scroll backwards and watch the ones you missed. It seems to do that pretty well. And since the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 etc were partners in the YouView venture, it supports all their catch-up services, which is what you want.</p> <p>In most other respects, the Humax DTR-1000T looks pretty much like a twin-tuner Humax HDR-Fox T2 Freeview box, which is a cheaper option if you are happy to get unsupported services via a computer.</p> <p>However, the YouView box has a number of limitations. It doesn't provide media streaming \u2013 which seems a bit daft, because the HDR-Fox T2 does \u2013 and it doesn't have Wi-Fi. If your broadband router is a long way from your TV set, you will probably have to buy a couple of fast HomePlug devices to connect the two via your home's mains wiring. </p> <p>As you would expect, it needs a reasonably fast internet connection to work, and YouView recommends 3Mbps or more. Best make it an unlimited service as well. Watching lots of programmes online is going to consume many gigabytes of bandwidth, and the YouView box doesn't tell you how many gigs a particular programme is going to use.</p> <p>You can search for past programmes via apps, but there's a different app for each service. The TV partners are evidently not pooling their programmes on a content farm to provide a homogenous and consistent user experience. Programmes don't start playing immediately, and programmes from the commercial channels may have unskippable adverts.</p> <p>Of course, YouView has only just been launched, and there is only one YouView box on the market. If it's reasonably successful, the glitches should be ironed out, and in a couple of years, there should be a selection of cheaper, better YouView boxes to choose from.</p> <p>For consumers who want to avoid technology, YouView looks like the simplest way to get the UK's catch-up TV services in one box, without using a computer. People who already have a computer and possibly a games console or media streamer will be paying quite a high price for convenience.</p> <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I should have pointed out that, on YouView, you can search all of the on-demand and past programmes together from the search function.

  "<p>Marvel Comics has proved that even superheroes have a shelf life after killing off a major character in its X-Men series, in a scene described by one of the writers as \"very Shakespearean\".</p> <p>The development has been met with a combination of outrage and cynicism, but with the comic book Avengers vs X-Men #11 <a href=\"http://whatculture.com/comics/avengers-vs-x-men-11-penultimate-issue-review.php\" title=\"\">already on newsstands and attracting favourable reviews</a>, fans are coming to terms with the loss of a popular character.

Also known as Scott Summers, Cyclops has been taken over by the Phoenix force.</p> <p>Writer Brian Michael Bendis said Xavier's death \"felt very Shakespearean\". \"I don't always write in a very Shakespearean way but as I was putting the final touches on the scene and then when I saw the pencils I was quite surprised how large the tragedy truly felt,\" <a href=\"http://marvel.com/news/story/19365/avengers_vs_x-men_fatality\" title=\"\">he told Marvel</a>. \"Not only does Cyclops, who is arguably not in control of his own actions, murder his father, for lack of a better word, but he does it in front of every major player in the Marvel Universe. This isn't some rumour that's been spread around. Everyone saw him do it. Scott knows what he has done.\"</p> <p>Nonethless, Bendis said he was \"very happy\" that the Marvel team \"voted to whack the man\". The franchise, he said, had outgrown the bald telepath who founded the X-Men in 1963, and \"all of the characters had moved on to a place where Charles himself wasn't really needed anymore\".</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://marvel.com/images/gallery/story/19365/avengers_vs_x-men_fatality/image/932909\" title=\"\">moment of Xavier's murder</a> sees a fire-swept Cyclops tell his mentor: \"You are not my father\". Xavier responds: \"That is enough!\", and Cyclops agrees. \"It is,\" he says, before blasting his father figure.</p> <p>Some fans expressed outrage at the offing of one of the series' most popular characters. Others were more cynical, pointing out that Xavier has, in fact, <a href=\"http://www.bleedingcool.com/forums/front-page-comic-news/62393-many-deaths-spoilers-print.html\" title=\"\">met his maker on several other occasions</a> and has always returned.

  "<p>Stephen Gough, the former soldier known as the Naked Rambler after repeatedly being arrested for hiking without clothes, has been sent back to jail after he failed to co-operate with social workers.</p> <p>After again appearing in the dock naked, Gough was sentenced to five months in prison at Kirkcaldy sheriff court. Sheriff James Williamson lost patience with Gough for refusing to allow social workers to assess his mental health after he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/23/naked-rambler-mental-health-checks\" title=\"\">broke down during his last appearance in court</a>.</p> <p>Williamson told Gough, 53, a former marine from Eastleigh in Hampshire, that his failure to co-operate with social workers gave him no choice but to re-imprison him.</p> <p>At one stage during the short hearing, the sheriff warned Gough, who appeared drawn but in control of himself, that he would be removed from court and sentenced in his cell because he initially refused to sit down for sentencing to conceal his body from the public areas of the court.</p> <p>Williamson told Gough, who has spent most of the last six years in solitary confinement in Scottish jails after repeatedly being convicted of breach of the peace following complaints about his nakedness, that he had behaved with arrogance and self-indulgence.</p> <p>On 20 July, Fife police had received several public complaints about Gough walking without clothes through Townhill near Dunfermline, only a few days after his release from Perth prison where he had completed a previous sentence for breach of the peace.</p> <p>As senior officers had drawn up a new policy to try to compromise with Gough to avoid arresting him again, police suggested he change route over some fields to avoid a children's playground, or cover himself up and continue walking, or accept a lift from police past the playground on to a less public route.</p> <p>Gough refused all three offers and was arrested. \"That shows a degree of arrogance and disregard for the rights of other members of the public, in particular children, who have the right not to see naked men. Your self-indulgence has carried on. In these circumstances I have no alternative but to choose a custodial sentence,\" Williamson said.</p> <p>At the first hearing at Kirkcaldy sheriff court three weeks ago, the judge had questioned whether Gough was showing signs of mental illness when he broke down in tears and appeared to be highly agitated and erratic.</p> <p>Defending himself, Gough, who was heavily bearded and gaunt, had begun sobbing as he objected to prosecution allegations that his conduct was offensive and indecent. \"There's nothing about me as a human being that is indecent or alarming or offensive. That's where I'm coming from, which is deep inside,\" Gough said.</p> <p>He continued: \"It's me, standing up for what I am. [Because] all of us are human beings too and we have children and our children are beautiful and we're beautiful too, because we're human beings \u2013 all the same. I have nothing to be ashamed about. I'm just a bloke standing up for the truth of what I am.\"</p> <p>Williamson told him his behaviour raised doubts about his emotional and mental state. \"I want somebody independent to see whether your mental health is all that it should be,\" he said, \"because, in the absence of any good reason otherwise, you're going to end up serving prison sentence after prison sentence.\"</p> <p>Shortly before Gough was sentenced, Brian Robertson, the depute fiscal, told the court that in 2007 Gough had agreed to, but then rejected, offers from the police to drive him home, then to an address in York.</p> <p>The prosecution wanted to make the same offer again, Robertson said: \"The authorities are prepared to facilitate his return home if his behaviour after the current case doesn't cause alarm to the public and necessitate his arrest.\"</p>",
  "<p>A former News International security guard has appeared in court in relation to charges that he conspired to pervert the course of justice in connection with the police investigation into alleged phone hacking at News of the World.</p> <p>Lee Sandell, 26, appeared at Westminster magistrates court on Thursday morning accused of conspiring, on a day between 15 July and 19 July 2011 to \"conceal documents, computers and other devices from the Metropolitan police\" who were investigating phone hacking of public figures and others at the News of the World.</p> <p>Sandell was ordered by Justice Quentin Purdy to appear at Southwark crown court on 26 September for a plea and case management hearing alongside co-defendants Rebekah Brooks, her husband, Charlie Brooks, and three others \u2013 Brooks' chauffeur Paul Edwards, News International's former security chief Mark Hanna and former security guard Daryl Jorsling.</p> <p>Sandell, dressed in a light grey suit, spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth.</p> <p>Three bail conditions were set down by Purdy \u2013 that he does not contact, directly or indirectly, any of his co-defendants; that he gives the police 48 hours' notice of any foreign travel; and that he does not enter News International's offices at Thomas Moore Square in Wapping, east London.</p> <p>Sandell was not an employee of News International but worked for a security firm contracted by the publisher.</p> <p>Purdy said it was a matter of law that his case should be moved to the higher court.

Tunnelling through the turquoise waves, he dives past brightly coloured fish and coral, until he reaches the sandy bottom of the seabed, 20 metres deep, where he begins scouring for tonight's dinner.</p> <p>He wears no mask, no fins, and no diving tank. He prefers sarongs and button-down shirts decorated with seashell and starfish motifs but the most startling thing about him underwater is his eyes. They are wide open.</p> <p>Ngui, 30, belongs to the Moken, a nomadic, seafaring tribe of hunter-gatherers who live in the southern seas of Burma and Thailand. Little is known about their origins, but it is believed they descended from migrant Austronesians who set sail from southern China around 4,000 years ago. Spending eight months of the year at sea, the Moken roam in small flotillas of <em>kabang</em> \u2013 boats fashioned from a single tree and shared by a nuclear family \u2013 and return to land only to barter fish and shells for essentials such as rice and petrol, or to wait out the monsoon season in temporary shacks. It is a way of life that has existed, unchanged, for centuries \u2013 but one that may not last for much longer.</p> <p>The 2004 tsunami greatly depleted the source of the Moken's only livelihood: the ocean's once-abundant array of seafood. International fishing boats are now wiping out the little that's left. Those Moken who have moved ashore are often forced to take dangerous jobs for menial pay. Those who stay at sea are sometimes arrested for lacking papers or permits. Others return to land after months afloat only to find their huts destroyed and luxury tourist resorts built in their place.</p> <p>\"The sea has changed and life has changed,\" explains Ngui's father, Jao. \"Things we used to do we can't do any more. Places we used to go we can't go any more. Life isn't fun any more.\"</p> <p>It would be difficult to find a family that represents the changes wrought on the Moken as well as Jao's. He was born on a boat and spent his childhood at sea. He married at 16 and nearly pursued a traditional, aquatic lifestyle \u2013 until he and his wife decided to settle on land.</p> <p>\"Life was hard being illiterate,\" says Jao in the cramped house in Kuraburi they now share with a 13-member extended family. \"I wanted my children to go to school and have options.\"</p> <p>Education is still a relatively new concept to the roughly 2,000 Moken who live in the waters around Burma and Thailand, most of whom are stateless. A recent push by various charities and the Thai government to issue Thai identity cards has granted some access to state-run schools and healthcare, but claiming full-blown citizenship \u2013 by proving that they, or a parent, were born in Thailand \u2013 is a complex issue for a nomadic people who hardly use numbers and mark the date according to the tide, not the Gregorian calendar.</p> <p>Even getting children to school can prove trying, said Sumana Sirimangkala, headteacher at the only school on Koh Lao, an island of 50 Moken families on the Thai-Burmese border. \"Moken lack supplies like clothes, food, stationery, textbooks, shoes, raincoats, lifejackets, umbrellas \u2013 all the things that are necessary for children to come to school,\" she says.</p> <p>\"Moken can't afford any of these things, so the school has to provide it all \u2013 otherwise they don't want to come.\"</p> <p>Moken children regularly drop out to help their parents earn money, students say. Some boys as young as eight are sent to work in construction, while others help their mothers dig for shells \u2013 backbreaking labour in the hot sun.</p> <p>Nearly all the men on the island are hired by Thai fishing boats to plant explosives on the seabed, or to dive for expensive and exotic rarities such as sea cucumber. Sometimes they are sent down with air run through thin plastic tubes hooked up to a spluttery, diesel-run compressor; other times they dive without any air at all. Many succumb to decompression sickness (the bends) from ascending too quickly; some don't return at all.</p> <p>\"I'm afraid of being killed, it's so risky,\" admits a 30-year-old Moken who has just returned from a fish-bombing expedition. \"We wire together four to five dynamite sticks, connect another explosive wire that hooks up to the boat, and then I dive down to the bottom of the sea. When I come back up, the sticks are ignited with a battery.\"</p> <p>Sitdit, a Moken elder whose son died from decompression sickness during a job in the Nicobar Islands, says risks such as these are increasingly part and parcel of a new way of life.</p> <p>\"We are running out of resources, so our skills have to be adapted to the new challenges,\" he says simply. \"Sometimes the big boats get caught by the Burmese military and Moken are arrested. I had four relatives arrested by the Burmese military and they all died in jail.\"</p> <p>Apart from a handful of researchers who had studied their language and customs \u2013 notably the French father-son anthropologist duo Pierre and Jacques Ivanoff \u2013 the Moken were a relatively unknown lot until the tsunami, when headlines described the mysterious \"<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-18560_162-681558.html\" title=\"\">sea gypsies [who] saw signs in the waves</a>\". Charities and religious groups poured in with free supplies \u2013 food, petrol, boats and building materials \u2013 at such a velocity that some communities were left bewildered by the handouts.</p> <p>\"We had to become Christian to qualify for a boat, so I became a Christian \u2013 I even became a church leader!\" explains Sitdit, his charity-built, two-room stilt house facing the \"church\", an empty wooden structure with a simple roof. \"All we had to do was follow the gospel and sing songs. But then the church [group] cheated us, and now nobody goes to church any more.\"</p> <p>Today, a different kind of communion is going on, one where Moken women in sarongs while away the afternoon heat with card games and whisky so strong it makes the eyes burn. When the men return from their jobs at sea, they too take to drinking and gambling.</p> <p>\"There's an issue with their drinking a lot of alcohol \u2013 it's everywhere,\" says Jitlada Rattanapan of <a href=\"http://plan-international.org/\" title=\"\">Plan Thailand</a>, a charity working to support Moken children.</p> <p>At Baan Tung Wah, a Moken village of around 70 families in the mainland resort town of Khao Lak, children with snotty noses and dirty T-shirts beg for sweets while elders take shots of strong drink. Most of the parents are away doing menial day jobs \u2013 working in construction, spraying insecticides, or scavenging for recyclables along the beaches and streets \u2013 leaving the children to play among puppies and chickens in the rubbish-filled streets.</p> <p>\"Everyone in this village drinks \u2013 they hit their kids, too,\" says a shopkeeper, Kong Kwan, 35, who spends all day selling sweets and crisps to Moken children and petrol and whisky to Moken elders. \"Sometimes the police come, but they can't be bothered to deal with it.\"</p> <p>The community's 20-year-old youth leader, Big, says that life in the village can be stifling, forcing many youths to look for a way out.</p> <p>\"We're restricted to living in this area only \u2013 about five acres [2 hectares] \u2013 and because of the influx of hotels and resorts around here, the sea has been polluted,\" he says. \"That makes it difficult to go fishing. So a lot of young people just choose easier jobs, like working in hotels or at 7-Eleven.\"</p> <p>Big adds that the Moken youth have pretty much \"assimilated seamlessly\" into Thai society, so much so that \"whatever 'bad Thais' do, Moken do now too\", he notes. \"Drugs, stealing, marijuana, glue-sniffing. We never saw this before, and it's getting serious.\"</p> <p>The village is trying to counter such behaviour by offering classes in Moken language and customs to the children, many of whom are unaware of their traditions. Other classes, directed at teens, offer training as tour guides.</p> <p>The community leader, Hong, who heads the classes and created the village's Moken museum, hopes that turning Baan Tung Wah into an ecotourism destination may help get people back on track.</p> <p>\"Moken are supposed to travel, to be nomadic, to travel freely. So if we cannot travel freely, we are dead, culturally at least,\" he says. \"Moken children use mobile phones, study English and choose to be educated. We've abandoned our old traditions so much we risk losing them entirely.\"</p> <p>While many charities working for the Moken promote education and citizenship as giving new \"options\" to such a vulnerable group, Narumon Hinshiranan \u2013 a cultural anthropologist at Chulalongkorn University who speaks fluent Moken and has studied the group for the past decade \u2013 says this kind of \"one-size-fits-all development \u2026 limits their nomadic background\".</p> <p>\"I don't see education as an 'option', I see it as integration into Thai society \u2013 so that they are essentially cut off from their roots.\"</p> <p>Those who have pursued this new kind of life \u2013 such as Jao's 23-year-old daughter, Kang, who is so far the only Moken to have graduated from university \u2013 may determine what choices the Moken make next.</p> <p>\"I see myself as a bridge between the Moken community and the outside world,\" says Kang, who this month starts her first job, as the only Moken teacher at the school on Surin island.</p> <p>She will be living with her brother Ngui, along with some 200 other Moken villagers, but they will be parallel lives in what seems like a parallel world.</p> <p>\"I like to be out doing things,\" says Ngui, thrusting a hand out to the sea to explain why he chose not to stay in school. \"I dive to collect seafood, gather it up bit by bit, and sell it to shops. It's enough to make a living for now.\"</p> <h2>The Moken<br></h2> <p>\u2022 The Moken are one of many sea gypsy tribes across south-east Asia: there are the Orang Laut of Indonesia; the Bajau of Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines; and the Salone (Moken) of Burma</p> <p>\u2022 Thailand is home to an estimated 12,000 sea gypsies, divided into three groups: the Moken, the Moklen and the Urak Lawoi</p> <p>\u2022 A 2003 study by Lund University in Sweden found that the underwater vision of Moken children was twice as good as that of their European counterparts</p> <p>\u2022 Food sourcing is subsistence-based: men traditionally spear fish, or use nets or traps, to find seafood, while women catch crabs and oysters by hand, or dig for shells. They also engage in basic agriculture</p> <p>\u2022 The Moken are often described as sincere and peace-loving, preferring to flee trouble than engage in disagreements</p> <p>\u2022 Traditionally animist, the Moken perform a large spirit-offering festival in the fifth lunar month and celebrate death by singing, dancing and drinking</p> <p>\u2022 Though the Moken give themselves only one name, the Thai monarchy has created surnames for them, among them \"Klatalee\" (\"brave person of the sea\")</p> <p>\u2022 A bucket of sea cucumbers, which the Moken dive for, earns about $10 a day. A small dish of the stuff sells for $30 or more in Taiwanese restaurants</p> <p>\u2022 Moken are often called \"dirty islanders\" by Thai people, a phrase that has encouraged many Moken youth to adopt Thai fashion and haircuts to fit in</p> <p>\u2022 Surin island, home to a large Moken settlement, was turned into a national marine park by Thailand in 1981, rendering illegal traditional Moken activities such as fishing and logging (in order to make boats)</p> <p>\u2022 Burma has been rumoured to be looking to permanently resettle many of its Moken and has already turned one Moken island into a military base.</p>",
  "<p>\"You mention Talk Talk and people either go 'What, that 80s pop group?' or they freak out and say, 'Those are some of my favourite ever records!'\" Joan Wasser, AKA <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jul/30/meltdown-joan-as-police-woman\" title=\"\">Joan as Police Woman</a>, pauses. \"They are a really confusing band.\"</p> <p>Confusing, mysterious, beautiful and \u2013 at least until recently \u2013 largely overlooked, Talk Talk's journey from early 80s synth-pop to late 80s post-rock has resulted in a diffuse and tangled legacy. Tracing the line from perky hit singles such as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge-IFWGq-6o\" title=\"\">Today</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqjttpl3peI\" title=\"\">Talk Talk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXQYyKzyDaE\" title=\"\">It's My Life</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXsmyLtpxlA\" title=\"\">Life's What You Make It</a> to their final albums, 1988's <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/spirit-of-eden-mw0000652670\" title=\"\">Spirit of Eden</a> and 1991's <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/laughing-stock-mw0000268987\" title=\"\">Laughing Stock</a>, is to discover that a clearly defined path has gradually disappeared into a thicket of brambles and honeysuckle.</p> <p>It's taken two decades, but their music has started permeating the wider culture. Wasser is one of 30 artists contributing to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Spirit-Talk-Various-Artists/dp/B008BIDNOI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347552744&amp;sr=8-1\">Spirit of Talk Talk</a>, a tribute album curated by ex-Depeche Mode keyboard player Alan Wilder and designer, entrepreneur \u2013 and rabid fan \u2013 Toby Benjamin. Contributing artists range from Linton Kwesi Johnson to King Creosote, White Lies to Peter Broderick, while the musical settings encompass dubstep, folk, industrial, electronica and jazz.</p> <p>Although each stage of the band's evolution is represented \u2013 \"We wanted to show that through subtle and sensitive arrangement the entire catalogue justifies serious re-evaluation,\" Wilder says \u2013 the main focus falls on 1986's rootsy but relatively accessible<a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-colour-of-spring-mw0000650865\" title=\"\"> The Colour of Spring</a> album and their final two records. \"What was so unusual about Talk Talk is that they experienced a career in reverse,\" says Wilder. \"There was a direct correlation between the quality increase and the popularity decrease. I hope this album can reignite an appreciation of the influence of those last two records.\"</p> <p>Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock are shrouded in mystery, partly because that's the way they are built, but also because the people who made the records are reluctant to discuss them. Talk Talk's singer and creative mastermind Mark Hollis hasn't released any music since 1998 and doesn't interact with the media, while his co-writer and producer <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tim-friese-greene-mn0000601468\" title=\"\">Tim Friese-Greene</a> politely but firmly declined an interview on the grounds that \"I don't talk Talk Talk talk any more. It was such a long time ago.\" Former band members Lee Harris and Paul Webb also observe a dutiful vow of silence these days.</p> <p>Phill Brown is a little more forthcoming. Brown engineered Spirit of Eden and recalls an \"endlessly blacked-out studio, an oil projector in the control room, strobe lighting and five 24-track tape-machines synced together. Twelve hours a day in the dark listening to the same six songs for eight months became pretty intense. There was very little communication with musicians who came in to play. They were led to a studio in darkness and a track would be played down the headphones.\" Asked whether Hollis is an awkward genius or a regular Joe, Brown replies: \"All of the above! Stubborn, focused, but humorous. In some ways a genius, but it was a team effort \u2013 and it was a big, talented team.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:album:7vqMpYHIqqWQQc0IVR03ue\"> <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:album:7vqMpYHIqqWQQc0IVR03ue\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:album:7vqMpYHIqqWQQc0IVR03ue\">Reading on mobile? Listen here<br></a><br>The resulting album featured six improvised pieces full of space and unhurried rhythm, stitching pastoral jazz, contemporary classical, folk, prog rock and loose blues into a single, doggedly uncommercial musical tapestry. The record label, naturally, had a seizure. EMI's director of repertoire, Nigel Reeve, is now the main point of contact for all things Hollis. Back in 1988 he was in a relatively junior position at the label when Spirit of Eden landed. \"There was real nervousness and misunderstanding about that record,\" he says. \"Nobody got it. There wasn't a hit single and they didn't know how to sell it. It caused problems.\"</p> <p>The band subsequently left EMI to make the equally uncompromising Laughing Stock for Polydor. Both albums sold poorly and were largely overlooked at the time of their release. Slowly, however, they found their constituency. Many of the artists on Spirit of Talk Talk vividly recall being turned on to these records by fellow musicians. For Wasser it was Antony Hegarty's violinist Maxim Moston; <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/oct/31/peter-broderick-review\" title=\"\">Peter Broderick</a> remembers \"a couple of the Efterklang guys sitting me down in 2007, playing me Spirit of Eden and telling me how much of an influence it had been\"; Lone Wolf's Paul Marshall acted on a tip-off from Wild Beasts. \"I could not believe I'd missed these albums. They shot to the top of my list of all-time favourite records.\"</p> <p>Just what is it that makes this music so compelling? \"It's uncompromising,\" says <a href=\"http://guillemots.com/\" title=\"\">Guillemots</a>' Fyfe Dangerfield, who covers The Rainbow, in collaboration with Thomas Feiner and Robbie Wilson. \"In one way it's slow and quite laid-back, but there's this uncomfortable, abrasive quality. They were doing such poppy stuff before, but this was obviously what was inside Mark Hollis's heart, and it feels like it. There's no notion of the outside world at all.\"</p> <p>Like a puzzle no one really wants to solve, late period Talk Talk stubbornly refuses to give up its secrets and is therefore endlessly open to interpretation. For Dangerfield, the music feels quintessentially English. For Wasser, who covers Myrrhman, \"it has a blues thing that makes me think of New Orleans. Like a big, old house full of ghosts and swirling memories. The spectrey vibe.\" Then there's Hollis's voice: unsettling, intense, not pretty but oddly beautiful. \"There's an effortlessly devastating and passionate tone to it,\" says <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/white-lies\" title=\"\">White Lies</a>' Charles Cave. \"It sounds like he's always struggling, and I love to hear that.\"</p> <p>Covering these distinctive, amorphous songs throws up a series of challenges to any musician. \"You almost need to take the atmosphere as being as much part of the track as the melody and lyrics,\" says Dangerfield. \"In the end it became about interpreting the feel of it.\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/king-creosote\" title=\"\">King Creosote</a>, who turns Give It Up into a sprightly squeezebox number, wanted \"to pick a song that I could somehow make ring true. It's not my favourite. I wouldn't go near my favourite Talk Talk songs with a bargepole!\" Toby Benjamin mutters wryly that some fans will regard the whole idea of a covers album as \"sacrilege\".</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mXsmyLtpxlA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mXsmyLtpxlA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mXsmyLtpxlA\">Reading on mobile? Watch here</a></p> <p>The band's impact on modern music is palpable but hard to quantify. Reeve acknowledges the irony that, not long after Talk Talk were kicked off EMI for delivering Spirit of Eden: \"Radiohead produced a similar kind of record and nobody batted an eyelid.\" Elbow are huge fans, while members of Arcade Fire and Bon Iver appear on the tribute album. \"Judging by the feedback and the general level of interest from everyone who wanted to be involved, their influence is massive,\" says Wilder, who suggests artists are drawn not so much to a sound as a sensibility. \"The meticulous and sheer bloody-minded, anti-establishment approach speaks to musicians who care passionately about their craft but find themselves diverted from their vision by outside influences.\"</p> <p>Hollis's distaste for image-building and promotion worked against the band at the time; now it's become an advantage, feeding into the perfect myth of an artist who achieved all he wanted and then walked away. Although Hollis chose to play no part in the project \u2013 \"We got feedback from a friend saying he wished us luck and that he liked the Matthias Vogt Trio's version of April 5th, but that's it\" \u2013 Wilder says that his guiding criteria when listening to each cover was \"to try and place myself in the head of Mark Hollis and imagine if he would enjoy what he heard\". According to Reeve, however, \"I'm not sure Mark will ever get around to listening to it. We've played Talk Talk stuff in the office when he's been there and he won't listen to more than 30 seconds before he wants it turned off.\" Last month, however, news emerged of his first music for 14 years, which will feature on the US TV drama Boss on 21 September (though not on the stream of its soundtrack).</p> <p>Having sued EMI following the unauthorised release of the 1991 remix album History Revisited, relations between Hollis and the label are now cordial. He and Reeve have been collaborating on the tracklisting for a new Talk Talk compilation, Natural Order, due later this year. \"Mark pops into the office every few months,\" he says. \"We have a coffee and a chat, mostly about football. He's a bit of a Spurs fan.\" The mythology surrounding his retreat into silence apparently bears little relation to the day-to-day reality. \"He lives a very normal life, it's just like he changed jobs,\" says Reeve. \"There's nothing in Mark driving him to make a new record, I don't think. In all the conversations I have with him he says: 'I did it. Full stop.' He got to where he wanted to go.\" Finally, the rest of the world is catching up.</p> <p>\u2022 Spirit of Talk Talk is out now on Fierce Panda.

  "<p>John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture select committee, has accused Lord Justice Leveson of allowing people with grudges against the press to use his inquiry as a platform to kick the media industry.</p> <p>Whittingdale, a Conservative MP, also said that, as a result, Leveson had strayed beyond the remit of his judicial inquiry, set up by David Cameron last year to address issues raised by the phone hacking scandal.</p> <p>Speaking to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00dv9hq\" title=\"\">Radio 4's The Media Show</a> on Wednesday afternoon, Whittingdale responded to a question about the inquiry's remit by saying that Leveson \"has almost encouraged anyone who has a grudge against the press over many years to come and sort of unburden themselves in front of him\".</p> <p>Whittingdale said this meant that the judge has been examining issues \"which just seem to me to be a long way from what he was meant to be doing \u2013 things like the question of Page 3 girls\".</p> <p>Whittingdale added: \"That is a controversial issue but you do not need a judicial inquiry to look at that, and some of the witnesses have borne grudges clearly about treatment by the press \u2013 quite understandably \u2013 but it has looked slightly like sort of ... form an orderly queue and come and kick the press.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the Leveson inquiry was unavailable for comment.</p> <p>Whittingdale said that he agreed with the need for an inquiry following the News of the World phone-hacking revelations. But he added that he believed the inquiry was hamstrung by its inability to investigate what happened at the paper \"until after the criminal prosecutions had been finished\".</p> <p>\"Now it appears that [Leveson] may drop that part of the inquiry altogether but ... there are big questions about how it came about that so many people condoned law breaking, or why the police didn't act on all the evidence that they possess,\" Whittingdale said.</p> <p>\"Those are the questions that still need answering and if Lord Justice Leveson doesn't ever look at those it means that we may never have those answers.\"</p> <p>Whittingdale admitted that prime minister David Cameron would be under political pressure to implement Leveson's recommendations immediately but said that he should resist this.</p> <p>He added that statutory regulation is not likely to be something Cameron would want to implement because \"any politician is going to think twice about taking on the press in the runup to a general election\". He added that he opposed statutory regulation, which \"we should avoid if we possibly can\".</p> <p>Whittingdale's remarks represent another salvo in the lobbying battle rumbling on as Leveson prepares his report based on evidence heard by the inquiry over eight months of witness hearings.</p> <p>The report is expected to be published in November and will provide Cameron's government with proposals on the future regulation of the press.</p> <p>In late August the Times reported that the prime minister is planning to give the industry another chance to improve self-regulation, rather than go for more radical reform, which could include statutory underpinning.</p> <p>This prompted Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/31/david-cameron-leveson-simon-hughes?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">to urge Cameron to keep an open mind about the Leveson report</a>.</p> <p>Cameron told Leveson during his testimony earlier this year that the future press watchdog \"can't be self-regulation, it has to be independent regulation\". But he strongly hinted he did not support full statutory regulation.</p> <p>\"It would be much better if we could deliver it without statute,\" he said, adding that the test of the new press regulator would be whether it worked for people like the parents of Milly Dowler and Madeleine McCann.</p> <p>Lord Black, the chairman of Presbof, which funds the discredited Press Complaints Commission, is believed to be playing a pivotal behind-the-scenes role. He is also a former PCC director.</p> <p>He is close to Cameron and is co-ordinating the industry's response to Leveson, including proposed new powers of investigation and fines of up to \u00a31m for breaches of strict codes of conduct on a range of issues from privacy to accuracy.</p> <p>Leveson also expressed his \"disappointment\" that a confidential letter he sent to newspaper groups warning of potential criticism in his final report was made public last month.</p> <p>Chris Blackhurst, the editor of the Independent, also went on The Media Show last month and claimed that Leveson was \"loading a gun\" for the industry and that the judge's warning letter, which was sent to all main newspaper publishers, was a \"point by point demolition\" of the press.</p> <p>The inquiry issued a statement pointing out it was legally obliged under inquiries legislation to give anyone who will be criticised in the final report a written warning of that potential criticism to give them an opportunity to respond to it.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

In fact, 16 September 1992 was liberation day for the UK economy, which was slowly being strangled by membership of the European exchange rate mechanism, the forerunner of the single currency.</p> <p>The effects of that momentous 24 hours live on two decades later. Without Black Wednesday, Tony Blair would never have become prime minister, there would have been no monetary policy committee, and Britain, in all likelihood, would have been part of monetary union. David Cameron, who can be seen in the<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHDsO7gvXHQ\" title=\"\"> footage of Norman Lamont </a>announcing Britain's exit from the ERM as the autumn night closed in around the Treasury, would still be a young MP working his way up through the Conservative ranks.</p> <p>British politics was turned on its head as a result of the humiliation of John Major's government. Labour had just suffered its fourth straight general election defeat in April 1992 and, deep down, its leaders thought it possible they would never form a majority administration again. In 1997, Blair won the biggest victory in Labour's history and went on to do what Attlee and Wilson had never managed: to serve two full terms in Downing Street.</p> <p>By contrast, the Conservative brand suffered permanent damage. The four election victories from 1979 and 1992 were not because the Conservatives being liked, but because they had the reputation for being more competent managers of the economy than a Labour party still tainted by the austerity programme imposed on Britain by the International Monetary Fund in 1976. That reputation was shredded when the Major government surrendered to the power of financial speculation and, despite the strong bounce in the economy between late 1992 and May 1997, voters neither forgave nor forgot. For the Conservatives, if not the country, it was indeed Black Wednesday.</p> <p>The economic and political crisis of September 1992 had its origins in the raging boom of 1987 and 1988. Until then, the government of Margaret Thatcher had believed it had cracked Britain's long-term economic problems, with several years of strong growth and low inflation in the mid-80s. The then chancellor, Nigel Lawson, decided that the best way to keep the cost of living in check was for the pound to shadow the German mark, believing that this would import Teutonic anti-inflationary zeal into the UK.</p> <p>It was a policy disaster. Interest rates were cut to prevent sterling from rising and this led to an orgy of mortgage borrowing. House prices rose sharply and so did inflation, from a trough of just over 2% in 1986 to almost 10% in 1990. By that point Lawson had gone, but his successor \u2013 Major \u2013 decided that the way for Britain to kick its inflation habit for good was to join the ERM, a device by which European currencies had to trade within fixed bands against the mark. The central point of the UK's band was DM2.95 and it was only allowed to fluctuate by 6% in either direction \u2013 from DM2.78 to DM3.13.</p> <p>The Treasury was convinced that ERM membership would provide a solid anchor for monetary policy, and the decision to join in October 1990 was welcomed by all three main political parties, the CBI and the TUC.</p> <p>Unfortunately, two things conspired to wreck the ERM experiment. Firstly, at that very moment the economy was plunging into a deep recession triggered by a doubling of interest rates from 7.5% in the summer of 1988 to 15% in the autumn of 1989. Unemployment rose sharply and many of those who had bought homes during the boom found themselves out of work, unable to pay their mortgages and sitting in homes worth a lot less than they had paid for them. Repossessions rose to record levels, as did bankruptcies.</p> <p>The second factor was the reunification of Germany at the end of the cold war, which led to rapid growth and upward pressure on inflation in 1991 and 1992. Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, raised interest rates and this made the mark more attractive to investors, leading to an increase in its value. Countries that had their currencies pegged to the mark came under pressure to raise their own rates in order to keep within their ERM bands. By the summer of 1992, the Major government was facing a dilemma.</p> <p>The poor state of the domestic economy \u2013 with the jobless count heading towards three million for the second time in a decade \u2013 necessitated cutting interest rates. However, the discipline of ERM membership meant there was pressure to raise them.</p> <p>Major and Lamont insisted that there was not the slightest possible chance of this dilemma being resolved by Britain leaving the ERM, issuing a stream of increasingly defiant speeches culminating in one by the prime minister to the Scottish CBI in Glasgow six days before Black Wednesday in which he attacked those peddling \"quack doctor\" remedies. \"The soft option, the devaluer's option, the inflationary option, in my judgment that would be a betrayal of our future at this moment, and I tell you categorically that is not the government's policy,\" Major said to applause.</p> <p>The government did its best to avoid the \"soft option\". Lamont pleaded with the Germans to cut rates. They refused. The British government made large-scale intervention in markets as the pound dropped towards DM2.77. The pound refused to budge. And on Black Wednesday itself, there was an announcement that interest rates were being raised from 10% to 12%. When that failed to stem the tidal wave of selling, Lamont announced that rates would go to 15% the following morning.</p> <p>In truth, this marked the moment when the white flag of surrender was raised above the Treasury and the Bank, because the financial markets knew that Lamont could not implement rates of 15% without completely wrecking the economy. The London stock market rallied before the close.</p> <p>By the next morning, the government was making the best of things. Interest rates were cut and continued to come down until they stood at 6% by early 1993. Home loans became easier to finance and consumers had more disposable income to spend. Outside the ERM, the pound fell by 15%, making British exports cheaper. A 16-year long period of continuous expansion began almost immediately.</p> <p>A number of key lessons were provided by Black Wednesday. The government had, at various times, tried to cut borrowing, restrict different measures of the money supply, shadowed the mark and joined the ERM in the hope of securing low and stable inflation. Now it decided to target low and stable inflation directly through an inflation target. The monetary framework that exists today had its genesis on 16 September 1992.</p> <p>Politicians of both parties also realised that ceding control over interest rates and the exchange rate was a risky business. The fact that the UK economy was not aligned with the German economy in 1992 meant the Major government was forced to import an entirely inappropriate set of policies. When the time came to decide whether Britain should join the single currency in 2003, Gordon Brown wisely insisted that the UK economy should show convergence with the other members and be flexible enough to cope with unexpected shocks as conditions of membership.</p> <p>A third lesson was that it was impossible for governments running dumb economic policies to resist the power of the financial markets. Major and his ministers dug their own grave by insisting, in the face of the evidence, that the policy was going to plan and could not be altered under any circumstances. That lesson has, perhaps, not been so well learnt.</p>",
  "<p>Thanks to the popularity of Channel Four's Big Fat Gypsy Wedding and the very public expulsion of residents from Dale Farm in Essex, most people think they know something about Gypsies and Travellers. This is certainly more than just a few years ago. To some extent this demystification is a good thing, although the means with which this has arisen is questionable.</p> <p>In 2006, the Commission for Racial Equality concluded that Gypsies and Irish Travellers were the most excluded group in Britain. In the intervening six years it appears very little has changed and some positive in-roads that were being made are now in reverse.</p> <p>Research for the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has found that the exclusion of Gypsies and Travellers is particularly acute in the areas of health, education and social care, with the lack of culturally appropriate accommodation \u2013 sites on which caravans can be legally sited \u2013 a key driver of exclusion.</p> <p>As a result of legislation and planning guidance between 2006-2010, significant, albeit slow, progress on increasing the number of available authorised pitches was starting to be made. This progress was largely attributable to two reasons. First, the duty placed on local authorities to compile an evidence base about accommodation need (local authorities are still required to do this); and second, the presence of the regional tier, which helped tackle apparent unequal need and which provided a very useful political scapegoat for local authority officers and elected members when developing local plans. The regional role is now no longer in place since the removal of the regional spatial strategies.</p> <p>With this, and other changes to the planning process, the provision of pitches appears to have slowed even further. Although local authorities are still required to produce an evidence base for their decisions, the sense of urgency about doing so relies on the objectives set by local authorities.</p> <p>Funding is still available, although much reduced, through the Gypsy and Traveller sites grant, which continues to help fund the development of new socially rented pitches. Local authorities are also incentivised to develop sites through application to the New Homes bonus. But it remains to be seen how likely it is that local authorities will take this approach when they could develop nice, familiar and far less politically sensitive bricks and mortar housing.</p> <p>The costs of moving people on wheels, who are arguably homeless, is becoming increasingly unsustainable in the current climate of resource scarcity; we are all losing here.</p> <p>Gypsies and Travellers lose as they continue to have a lack of available lawful accommodation and are continually vilified for living in overcrowded or unauthorised conditions. The rest of us lose as we continuously live in tension with Gypsies and Travellers who move on to and develop sites without planning permission. We lose the revenue generated by council tax and rent, and we help perpetuate poor outcomes in health and wellbeing for some of the most vulnerable members of our communities.</p> <p>Tackling and resolving these issues is complex \u2013 it always has been. Yet a concerted effort in meeting the shortfall of accommodation, around 6,000 to 7,000 pitches, and creating a pro-active rather than reactive approach to working with Gypsy and Traveller communities, will provide a pathway towards a fairer society for all.</p> <p><em>Dr Philip Brown is research fellow in University of Salford's housing and urban studies unit.

  "<p>The more we learn about events, the more we may understand. I sat through every single day of the Taylor inquiry, in the summer of 1989. I learned so much. Taylor was right in saying that the disaster was caused, mainly, through a lack of police control. Fans' behaviour, to the extent that it was relevant at all, made the job of the police, in the crush outside Leppings Lane turnstiles, harder than it needed to be. But it didn't cause the disaster any more than the sunny day that encouraged people to linger outside the stadium as kick-off approached.</p> <p>I held those views then, I hold them now. I have never, since hearing the Taylor evidence unfold, offered any other interpretation in public or private.</p> <p>It is against that backcloth that any documents with my name attached, out of the 400,000 revealed, must be seen. For example, the reference to preparation for the contributions hearing (the court case to recover contributions to damages from Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and the stadium engineers who were also found, by Taylor, to be at fault) was to position South Yorkshire police's liability against the football club, the stadium engineers and the council which issued a defective safety certificate; it was NOT to apportion any blame whatsoever to the fans.</p> <p>In the absence of all the facts, I was called upon to resign 14 years ago, when I became the chief constable of Merseyside. I really welcome the disclosure of all the facts that can be known about the Hillsborough tragedy because I have absolutely nothing to hide. I read the 395-page report from cover to cover last night and that remains my position. The panel, in my view, has produced a piece of work that will stand the test of time and scrutiny. Whilst not wishing to become a conducting rod for all the genuine and justified hurt and anguish, I would invite anyone to do the same as me and read the document and the papers online. They document, in detail, my personal actions in respect of the Hillsborough tragedy, which were, in summary, as follows:</p> <p>I purchased a ticket and was an off-duty spectator at the match. As soon as I realised the unfolding tragedy, I put myself on duty, giving immediate assistance behind the south stand. I later set up a receiving centre, at a local police station, for supporters who had become separated from friends and family (see my contemporaneous statement online).</p> <p>In 1989, I was a chief inspector in a non-operational role at headquarters. Four days after the disaster (and after all the vile newspaper coverage had been written) I was one of several officers pulled together by the then deputy chief constable, Peter Hays, to support him in piecing together what had taken place at the event.</p> <p>By that time, the chief constable, Peter Wright, had handed over the formal investigation of the tragedy to an independent police force, West Midlands police. It was West Midlands police that presented evidence before the Taylor inquiry. The South Yorkshire deputy chief constable's team, under the leadership of Chief Superintendent Wain, was a parallel activity to inform chief officers of facts rather than rely on the speculation rampant at that time.</p> <p>Another team was later created (see Hillsborough Independent Panel Report pages 54 and 55; page 186 particularly para 2.6.35 which distinguishes the two separate teams; and page 319), to work with the solicitors who were representing South Yorkshire police at the Taylor inquiry, to vet statements from South Yorkshire police officers that were intended to be presented to the inquiry (see Hillsborough Independent Panel Report Part 2, chapter 11). I was not a member of that team. I never altered a statement nor asked for one to be altered. Two South Yorkshire police teams have been conflated in the minds of some commentators.</p> <p>I subsequently sat through each day of the Taylor inquiry, briefing the South Yorkshire chief constable and deputy chief constable on a regular basis. These briefings acknowledged and accepted the responsibility of the force in the disaster. The evidence was overwhelming.</p> <p>Shortly after the conclusion of the Taylor inquiry, I was posted to other duties. I had nothing further to do with the subsequent coroners' inquests and proceedings, other than occasional advice because of my knowledge of the evidence presented to the Taylor inquiry.</p>",

  "<p>As London Welsh left the Stoop last Friday night having lost to the champions by 40-3, a scoreline which barely highlighted the difference between the sides, it was tempting to ask whether their battle to secure promotion from the Championship had been worth it.</p> <p>Initially refused permission for failing to meet the criteria, they won a subsequent appeal on legal grounds. Less than two months before the start of the new season, they were admitted into the Premiership. They started recruiting but found themselves like a shopper going into a store on the last day of the sales; all they were left with was what no one else wanted.</p> <p>The sales analogy is apposite because with central funding of around \u00a31.5m, London Welsh cannot afford to spend anywhere near the salary cap of virtually three times that. Staying up will prove every bit as difficult as getting into the top flight was, never mind that the last four promoted sides have all survived at least their first season in the Premiership.</p> <p>Three \u2013 Northampton, Leeds and Worcester \u2013 knew what to expect. The fourth club was Exeter who, like London Welsh, had never before been in the Premiership; a crucial difference was that the Chiefs had prepared for the ascent, developing their ground, facilities and squad over a number of years. Relegation has so far not been flirted with.</p> <p>London Welsh look in for a long season after two opening defeats that have seen their conquerors claim try bonus points. They were up against last season's beaten finalists, Leicester, and the team that won the final, Harlequins. The games were only five days apart.</p> <p>The Exiles' fate will not be decided by how they get on against the top sides, yet there was something in the way they subsided against Harlequins to unsettle even their most sanguine supporters. A thin squad quickly found its breaking point.</p> <p>The professional game board is this month looking at the minimum standards criteria for clubs aspiring to the Premiership and what needs to change after London Welsh's appeal, not just because it was successful but because part of the clause governing primacy of tenure was ruled by the panel of three QCs to be anti-competitive and outside the law.</p> <p>What should be under review is not the wording of the criteria with the aim of closing a loophole but the desirability of having a long-winded list of what a promoted club must have and do. The London Welsh appeal panel rejected the club's argument that promotion should be an enshrined principle, an automatic right. Having criteria, it ruled, is necessary but they should be applied equally to those in the Premiership and clubs seeking to get there.</p> <p>Are the criteria elitist? What lies at the heart of who should be in the Premiership is also driving the bid of the leading clubs in England and France to change the qualification process for the Heineken Cup. Merit is the word they use and, in principle, having the top six teams from the Top 14, Pro12 and Premiership competing for the trophy, along with the holders and the winners of the Amlin Challenge Cup, is fair, but if a consequence is to shrink the boundaries of the game, would it be right?</p> <p>Premiership Rugby argued when announcing its television deal with BT on Wednesday that it wanted the game in Europe to grow into a third competition that took in teams from smaller unions such as Russia and Spain, but it is not fuelled by altruism as it does battle in Europe. Having outflanked European Rugby Cup Ltd so adroitly, leaving the organisers minus belt and braces, it is now a battle between the clubs of England and France and the unions of the other four countries who cannot afford a devalued Heineken Cup.</p> <p>Much has been made of the success of Ireland in the Heineken Cup in recent seasons, first Munster and then Leinster: only twice in the last seven seasons has the trophy gone elsewhere, and if the rules were changed so that Ireland no longer had any automatic qualifiers, the pair can expect to be in the top six of the Pro12 for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Leinster and Munster are the only two Pro12 teams who attract support most Premiership clubs would be envious of. In the opening two rounds of the respective leagues, excluding the double header at Twickenham, seven sides attracted five-figure gates.</p> <p>Bath, Gloucester, Harlequins and Northampton drew between 10,438 and 12,550 spectators while Leicester played host to 19,250; more than Exeter, London Irish and London Welsh combined. Leinster and Munster's crowd figure for games that did not involve their leading Irish players were similar, 15,724 compared to 15,642.</p> <p>Likely casualties if the Heineken Cup rules are changed are Scotland and Italy. Their four professional teams between them could not reach the spectator figures generated by Leinster and Munster on the opening two weekends. How much more difficult would it be to sell rugby in the two countries if the Heineken Cup was not on the menu? How would it affect the recruitment of players?</p> <p>It may be too simplistic to say that the argument is whether wealth should be concentrated in the hands of a few or shared widely, but the crowd at Harlequins last Friday night were short-changed. The home followers would have been satisfied at a bonus point victory, but it was a match that reflected one side having three times the spending power of the other.</p> <p>Newcastle, relegated last season, will receive more from Premiership Rugby this season than London Welsh in the form of a parachute payment designed to soften the club's fall. That money is effectively what should be distributed to the Exiles and it is hard not to resist the thought that the whole purpose of the payment is to expedite the return of the demoted side at the expense of the club that replaced it. Given that, Premiership Rugby has little in the way of moral authority when it lays down demands to the rest of Europe.</p> <p>It is another reason why the criteria should be ripped up. All 12 clubs in the Premiership should have equal opportunity; all the salary cap does is achieve relative parity among the established members of the top flight. The likes of London Welsh are like beggars at a banquet, sneaking past the guards at the door.</p> <p>Exeter and Worcester have enjoyed extended stays in the Premiership not least because, owning their own grounds, they can bake their own bread rather than rely on crumbs handed down to them. London Welsh are miles from home, fated to return from where they came and all the flowing rugby in the opening two weekends of the Premiership cannot dispel the feeling that there is something rotten at the core.</p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 </em></strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/signup/thebreakdown\" title=\"\"><strong><em>This is an extract from the Breakdown, our free weekly take on the world of rugby.

  "<p>On a cold spring day in 1980 I was walking along Fleet Street, hands stuffed in my pockets, head down, facing another unfulfilling day as a sub-editor in the Daily Express features department. </p> <p>A familiar Cockney voice made me look up. Derek Jameson, with his trademark grin, greeted me with a cheery hello and I nodded as he walked past.</p> <p>I had gone on for maybe a dozen paces when he shouted after me: \"Have you got a minute?\" I turned back because I had got plenty of minutes. Without any preamble, he said: \"I hear you're unhappy at the Express. Why don't you come and be my features editor - 25 grand, a car, secretary, expenses...\"</p> <p>Within a couple of weeks I was installed as the London-based features editor of the Daily Star, a paper then produced in Manchester. It was a very different article from the one that exists today.</p> <p>It proved to be the first rung on an executive ladder that would lead, 10 years later, to the editorship of the Daily Mirror, so I have a lot to thank Jamie for. I was therefore upset to hear of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/sep/12/derek-jameson-dies-82\">his death yesterday, at the age of 82.</a></p> <p>I didn't discover until years afterwards that Jamie had withstood a great deal of ribbing about taking me on because of my background as a National Union of Journalists activist. The then Sun editor, Larry Lamb, told him: \"You must be mad, Derek.\"</p> <p>It didn't worry me, Jamie told me, \"because I was always more left-wing than you.\"</p> <p>This kind of boast was typical of Jameson. He saw himself as a working class lad who, having retained the accent of his youth in Hackney, never lost touch with his roots. His whole persona was built around being an anti-establishment rebel.</p> <p>Of course he compromised. But he did it in such an endearing way, with considerable swagger and high good humour, that it was impossible not to admire his chutzpah.</p> <p>I could never understand why he sued the BBC over its lampooning of him on Radio 4's <em>Week Ending</em> programme, nor his touchiness about Private Eye's nickname for him, Sid Yobbo.</p> <p>I prefer to remember a wonderful night in The Stab, the old Mirror pub, when he and the sports writer Hugh McIlvanney entered into a verbal battle over which of them came from the poorest background. (Think of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Yorkshiremen_sketch\">the Monty Python four Yorkshiremen sketch</a>)</p> <p>I seem to recall that Jamie won by claiming that he had been forced to eat dog biscuits. Like many of his stories, he may well have exaggerated more than a little. No matter, he was just fun to be around.</p> <p>Even his boasting was amusing. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/sep/12/derek-jameson\">In his obituary of Jamie,</a> Dennis Barker included a typical example: \"At the age of 55, I picked myself up once again and set out to conquer the airwaves. I was to become the breakfast toast of 10 million Radio 2 listeners and Rupert Murdoch's chief test pilot on Sky TV, the highest paid man in show business.\" </p> <p>Jamie was an entertainer who was better at hosting TV and radio programmes than running a newspaper. His editing stints at the Daily Express, Daily Star and News of the World were unremarkable. </p> <p>Admittedly, when he took up the NoW editorship in 1981, it had just suffered from the attentions of a maverick editor (Barry Askew) and, in its then broadsheet format, was losing sales. He couldn't convince Rupert Murdoch to take it tabloid and was upset when, after he was fired, his successor was allowed to do just that.</p> <p>So he went on to find fame as a broadcaster, turning his idiosyncratic personality to good advantage. For a time, he ran his radio show with his wife, Ellen - a colleague of mine from my casual subbing days at Reveille (a weekly paper published by the Mirror group). </p> <p>One of the joys of the programme were the occasional outbursts of bickering between the couple. On the single occasion I was a guest, there was something of a fully-fledged row. It was marvellous fun to witness and there was never the slightest doubt about their love for each other.</p> <p>Incidentally, it says something for Jamie's powers of persuasion that they were married at the Roman Catholic cathedral in Arundel, Sussex. My wife, who attended the wedding, wondered ever after how a man marrying for the third time to a divorced woman managed to obtain the necessary dispensations. </p> <p>Did he tell them a story? Quite possibly, because Jamie's life was one of perpetual invention. His journalistic mentor, Ronnie Bedford, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2012/jun/02/daily-mirror-reuters\">also died earlier this year</a>. As chief reporter at Reuters in the mid-1940s, he was given the task of turning Jamie, a messenger boy with only a rudimentary education, into a reporter.</p> <p>Jamie told me: \"Ronnie practically had to teach me how to read and write. He made me rewrite my first story 14 times... Ronnie always claimed it was only 13 times.\" In fact, Ronnie couldn't remember it happening at all. </p> <p>That was Jamie - no story ever went unembellished. I shall miss the wide grin that inevitably led to a bellowing laugh - and, of course, all those stories.</p>",
  "<p>In the current economic climate, all companies are under pressure to achieve more with less, in terms of both capital and resources. Moreover, many consumers now demand that companies demonstrate the social value that they or their suppliers provide. Nick Temple, of <a href=\"www.socialenterprise.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Social Enterprise UK</a>, sees procurement as a \"big opportunity both for social enterprises and the private sector to demonstrate their credentials and achieve positive social impact\".</p> <p>With annual reports and company websites increasingly containing bold claims on social impact and announcing new local partnerships with social enterprises, many companies are talking the talk, but are they walking the walk? For a select few the answer seems to be \"yes\".</p> <h2>Wates Group building links with social enterprise</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.wates.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Wates Group </a>, one of the UK's largest construction firms, is an example of a sizable company that is actively seeking to procure from social enterprises. Since 2010, Wates has committed to a pioneering policy of ensuring that it engages with at least one social enterprise on each new construction project. To date, Wates has traded with over 30 social enterprises on supply contracts exceeding \u00a33.5m.</p> <p>Rachel Wooliscroft, Wates' head of corporate responsibility, has explained that for Wates, \"working with social enterprises gives us the opportunity to support organisations that share many of our values and goals.\"</p> <h2>O2 thinking big and influencing others</h2> <p>In February 2012, O2 published its <a href=\"http://www.o2thinkbig.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Think Big</a> commitments that the company is aiming to achieve by 2015. One of those commitments was to establish processes to get more SMEs and social enterprises into its supply chain. Keithley Martin, head of supplier development of O2 UK, states that by \"working with a social enterprise we have an opportunity to use some of our considerable procurement spend to do social good without impeding our business objectives. So it's a virtuous circle, both a good thing to do and one that makes business sense.\"</p> <p>There is now a real focus on removing unnecessary barriers to participation by social enterprises and other SMEs. One option is for purchasers to enable enterprises to participate by offering innovative financial solutions to help them with payment terms additionally there is an increasing amount of opportunity to work with social enterprises and build their capacity to participate in the commercial market place.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.o2.co.uk/\" title=\"\">O2</a> has seen an opportunity to use its influence to open up not just its direct supply chain but also its extended supply chain. One challenge for larger companies is whether smaller social enterprises can deliver the goods and services at sufficient quality and quantity. While a contract may be too large or complex for a smaller social enterprise to deliver, it may not be an issue if they work as a sub-contractor to a larger direct supplier.</p> <p>Martin explains that another key aspect is \"working with SMEs and social enterprises to help them develop their ability to comply with our sustainability expectations of suppliers with regards to labour, environment, ethics and H&amp;S standards. This will make them more attractive to us and to others.\"</p> <h2>Intra-trading amongst social enterprises</h2> <p>When talking about how procurement can help social enterprise, most people think of commercial companies buying from social enterprises. However, as social enterprises and social businesses have grown, they themselves have become buyers, with the power to drive change as both a supplier and a customer.</p> <p><a href=\"http://hctgroup.org/\" title=\"\">HCT Group</a>, a social enterprise operating in the transport industry and On Purpose placement host, is working hard to expand both the number and range of social enterprises within its supply chain. Patrick Reyburn, strategic development manager at HCT Group, explains that, \"being a good social enterprise isn't only about the outcome. It's about the process as well. Who HCT spends its money with matters as much as who we spend our money on.\"</p> <h2>No trade-offs on quality</h2> <p>For HCT Group, regardless of an organisation's ethical stance, delivering quality remains key. Reyburn explains, \"Our contracts are won on price and quality. We compete against the likes of large multi-nationals and win. We deliver quality, and expect the same with no exceptions. We believe that a social enterprise must be an enterprise first. What we do with our profits after is what differentiates us.\"</p> <p>For Reyburn, \"there does not need to be a compromise between quality, price and ethics. Our growth and that of other social enterprises proves this. You can successfully trade as an asset-locked social enterprise and still deliver. How you spend your money is a vote for different ways of doing business \u2013 by spending in more ethical ways you can inspire customers and other companies alike to seek alternatives to traditional models of business.\"</p> <p>Nick Temple agrees and states that \"quality, price and delivery are crucial\". The challenge for any buyer is to do careful due diligence measuring both the quality of goods and services and the social value it provides.</p> <p>For social enterprises to increase their impact, they need to be competitive. Buyer due diligence is becoming more sophisticated, and this may help to boost quality and social impact of social enterprise goods and services. Equally, successful social enterprises are emerging themselves as buyers; Social Enterprise UK is currently campaigning for social enterprises to trade more with each other, with so-called \"inter-trading\" a focal point of its own plans for <a href=\"http://www.socialenterprise.org.uk/advice-support/notice-board/social-enterprise-day-2012-planning-stages\" title=\"\">Social Enterprise Day </a>on 15 November 2012.</p> <p>For social enterprises to grow, they need to force their way into the supply chains of larger companies. However, this can only happen if there is a continued focus on quality and delivery at competitive prices. A limited number of larger companies have realised the potential for social enterprise to improve their supply chains, encouraging and supporting their growth, but these remain in the minority and, for social enterprise, this will need to change.</p> <p><em>Evgenia Sivtsova and Jon Khoo and are 2012 On Purpose associates.

Rushdie's memoir Joseph Anton is published on 18 September.</p> <p>\"Tomorrow is huge, and 27 September will be big purely because the new Jamie and new JK Rowling [her first adult novel The Casual Vacancy] will be hitting shelves on the same day. Many other publishers have brought stuff forward to get out of their way \u2013 which is perhaps why Thursday looks so strong,\" said Philip Stone, charts editor at the Bookseller, who is tipping titles including Balding's memoir, Bear Grylls' Survival Guide and William Shawcross's collection of the late Queen Mother's letters as potential surprise hits this Christmas.</p> <p>\"For about three weeks, lots and lots of books will be published,\" said Andre Breedt from book sales monitor Nielsen BookScan. \"Most people aim to get their books out before mid-October at the latest, and there are more than 200 hardbacks published today.\"</p> <p>\"We deliberately went as soon after the Olympics as possible because we knew the timing would be great,\" said Joel Rickett, who is Balding's editor at Penguin. \"We wanted September because October has been such a crowded time over the last couple of years.\"</p> <p>Philip Pullman's take on the Brothers Grimm fairy tales and memoirs from unlikely colleagues Jessie J, Chinua Achebe, Tulisa Contostavlos and Jack Straw will also be jostling for place on 27 September, but the Bookseller is dubbing 11 October as \"Super Thursday\" \u2013 the annual day when the majority of potential Christmas bestsellers are released. Last year it fell on 29 September, and hardback sales went up by 35% week on week.</p> <p>\"Thursday 11th October looks, frankly, ridiculous,\" said Stone. \"There's a huge volume of titles by some of the most bankable brands in the industry \u2013 Kate Morton, Jo Nesbo, Harlan Coben, Maeve Binchy, Andy McNab \u2013 plus a whole load of celebrities: Paul O'Grady, Cheryl Cole, Olly Murs, Miranda Hart, Rod Stewart.\" The day will also see the release of memoirs from David Mitchell, Will Young and David Walliams, while a just-announced memoir from Olympic medallist Ennis is due on 8 November. In total, 232 hardbacks are listed for publication on 11 October, according to Nielsen BookScan. Preceding that, another 231 are due out on 27th September as well as today's 217.</p> <p>The Christmas market is increasingly competitive, said Rickett, who has 33 events lined up for his author from tonight, including an appearance on Jonathan Ross at the weekend alongside Bieber. \"There is such competition for slots [in the bookshops], and there will be a lot of books around for which publishers paid a large amount and which aren't even going to get a display slot.\"</p> <p>By December, however, the best books will have risen to the top, Rickett predicted. \"When you're getting in to December, of course retailers want things which are backed by publishers but they also want the books which have really chimed with readers. So things will have shaken down.\"</p>",
  "<p>My grandad threatened to give up driving for many years before he was forced to do so by the cancer that also killed him. \"I think that's it for me now,\" he would say, after my dad informed him that he had run another red light. \"You or Tom can have the car. I'll take the bus from now on.\" But he'd always end up giving it one more go. As someone who, by his 30s, was already frequently inclined to absentmindedly place his lit pipe in strangers' coat pockets and mistake himself in mirrors for another remarkably similar-looking bald, bespectacled man, it must have been hard for him to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/21/tom-cox-grandad-dozy-gene\" title=\"\">distinguish between natural doziness</a> and the mental frailties of old age. </p> <p>He was one of a generation of glove-wearing men who considered driving a minor artform, his car engines attended to no less conscientiously than his own body. Due to his trusting nature, the secondhand vehicles he enthusiastically purchased rarely arrived home in the healthiest state, but they very soon looked and smelled fantastic.</p> <p>When I part-inherited my grandad's <a href=\"http://www.toyoland.com/photos/1976/corona.jpg\" title=\"\">1976 Toyota Corona</a> in the mid-90s, I showed little appreciation for its astonishingly low mileage or spotless interior. At that stage of my life I viewed cars largely as stereos on wheels, and the fact that the Toyota had no cassette player on which I could play my H\u00fcsker D\u00fc and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/sonic-youth\" title=\"\">Sonic Youth</a> albums made me myopic regarding its plus points. </p> <p>It's only since then that I've realised that its tinny MW- and LW-only stereo was significantly responsible for making me admit to myself I far preferred the extrovert rock music of the 70s to its sludgy late-80s and early-90s equivalent, and that, at a time when I was living with my parents, over a mile from the nearest bus stop and several more from my friends, the car itself connected me to the world in a crucial way, taking me through the country lanes that surrounded us, past burned-out Ford Escorts and pheasant-shooting gamekeepers and beyond, towards what I told myself was civilisation.</p> <p>Since then, the Corona has taken on mythical status in my mind. I often sighingly refer to it as \"the best car I ever had\" \u2013 partly because it just might be, but also because, as a man over the age of 35, I'm contractually obliged to have a car in my past which I sighingly refer to as \"the best car I ever had\". With every passing year, I've become more regretful regarding the moss I allowed to grow up its wheel arches, increasingly chiding of my youthful inability to see it as a minor design classic.</p> <p>I could get another, but that wouldn't be the same. There's a big difference between an old car you've kept and loved for many years and an old car you've bought recently because it looks cool. I live in a part of rural Britain where many old car drivers are proper old car drivers \u2013 septuagenarian men who drive the same <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Morris.minor.bristol.750pix.jpg\" title=\"\">Morris Minors</a> they bought when they were 30 \u2013 and they'd soon rumble me for a pretender.</p> <p>I'm often tempted by classic cars, because they suit my delusional fantasy of living in an unrealistically edited version of the early 70s. I always chicken out, though, beset by visions of myself on the hard shoulder, crying and shyly asking a member of the RAC to hold me. A lot of people say owning a vintage car is showing off but it strikes me that it's actually an act of kindness, since you leave the most fun part of the experience \u2013 admiring its exterior while you drive \u2013 to others. </p> <p>Being less generous than that, I instead prefer to drive a small, six-year-old car with no discernible personality. It makes life simpler because, as a vehicle with few ambitions, it asks very little of me. I do sometimes feel I need a fix of oldness as a I drive it, but cater for this by only cleaning it once a year and only getting its broken bits repaired when I'm really keen to say hello to the nice black labrador at my local garage who often looks after the reception desk for the place's owner. I also drove through a giant puddle not long ago and lost half of my reg plate, making me briefly feel almost as special as someone with a personalised registration but without the expense and mock Georgian house in Surrey.</p> <p>I still look longingly at old cars, though. I recently made myself 20 minutes late for a meeting by crawling in the slow lane of the A11 behind a <a href=\"http://damox.com/cars/wallpaper/Dodge/1970_Dodge_Challenger_green.htm\" title=\"\">1969 Dodge Challenger</a> similar to the one in the film <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONChzy1Aiw8\" title=\"\">Vanishing Point</a>. Well, I say \"a meeting\": I was actually on the way to a record fair in Norwich where I'd heard there was an original copy of the <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/barefoot-jerry-mw0000874529\" title=\"\">second LP</a> by the 1970s stoner southern rock band <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsDbjVTJo4o\" title=\"\">Barefoot Jerry</a>, which was arguably an even bigger sacrifice. </p> <p>My intrigue finally got the better of me a fortnight ago, <a href=\"http://www.forevercampervans.com/\" title=\"\">when I hired a 1972 VW campervan from Taunton</a> to drive to the <a href=\"http://www.endoftheroadfestival.com/\" title=\"\">End of the Road festival</a> in Wiltshire, where \u2013 to add to the feeling of entering the past \u2013 there was no way of connecting to the internet on my phone. Or, to put it another way: three good friends and I shouted \"WHAT DID YOU SAY?\" at one another for 66 miles, spent four days crawling about, bruising and cutting our heads on various perilously designed bits of wood and metal, then shouted \"WHAT DID YOU SAY?\" at one another for another 66 miles.</p> <p>I make this sound slightly less enjoyable than it was: Freddie, our van (apparently all VW van owners name them), had plenty of character and his own bunk beds, and, going up a hill not far from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerne_Abbas_Giant\" title=\"\">Cerne Abbas Giant</a> in Dorset, with the control-free fan blowing hot air in your face and the smell of diesel fumes in your nose, you realised that a lot of the sensual side of driving is lost in a quiet modern car. But I'm not sure End of the Road was the ideal environment to get the full, romantic, rarefied retro experience of driving a 40 year-old VW van. Waking up and appraising the caravan field on the first morning, 12 of Freddie's close relatives could be seen from our front window. \"Had their owners too begun to view second gear less as a driver's right and more as an elusive, magical concept you might occasionally visit, with luck upon your side?\" I wondered. \"Had their side doors also stopped working altogether, upon the second opening?\" </p> <p>So many of us fantasise about a simpler life in the past, with none of the distractions of modern conveniences, but we overlook the small print. Sure, it's idly browsing the internet that sucks our life away today, but in 1972 other activities did similar damage: spending half an hour in front of an incomprehensible door, trying several different combinations of keys and turning methods to open it, say, or waiting for roadside assistance. Time marches on, but our ability to waste it has a way of staying constant.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Tom Cox's latest book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9781847399878/talk-to-the-tail-adventures-in-cat-ownership-and-beyond\" title=\"\">Talk to the Tail</a>, is out now in paperback.

  "<p>The Sun's response to the Hillsborough independent panel's report has, naturally enough, attracted much media attention. </p> <p>The current editor, Dominic Mohan, spoke well in his scripted TV apology yesterday. And he has published <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/sun_says/4508014/The-Sun-says-We-are-sorry-for-our-gravest-error.html\">an editorial today that also reflected his sorrow.</a> The front page, shown here, amounts to a total climbdown.</p> <p>It is tempting to see this abject apology as a commercial necessity to avoid a renewed boycott and a possible desertion of outraged readers. </p> <p>But I prefer to accept Mohan's words, both on air and in print, as a sincere expression of regret. After all, he wasn't around when it happened and there are very few, if any, Sun staff today who were there in April 1989.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396076545\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347521771132/Daily_Mirror_13_9_2012.jpg\" alt=\"Mir\" width=\"173\" height=\"223\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I am publishing The Sun's leading article in full at the end of this posting. Before that, to accompany today's front pages, here's a round-up of what newspapers say about the Hillsborough report, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2202398/Hillsborough-truth-transparency.html\">beginning with the Daily Mail.</a> </p> <blockquote> <p>\"We had long known that officers in charge of crowd control at Hillsborough on April 15, 1989, displayed appalling incompetence... We also knew that some tried to pin the blame on the Liverpool fans...</p> <p>What we didn't know, until yesterday's report, was the horrifying extent of the calculated police campaign to smear the good name of the dead and injured.</p> <p>No fewer than 164 police statements were doctored, of which 116 were amended specifically to remove comments unfavourable to the South Yorkshire force.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396076546\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347521825479/Daily_Mail_13_9_2012.jpg\" alt=\"mai\" width=\"176\" height=\"230\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There was callous dishonesty on an epic, institutional scale \u2013 a breach of trust as serious as it is possible to imagine.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/hillsborough-voice-of-the-mirror---deliver-1321816\">The Daily Mirror observed</a> that \"the British establishment covered up catastrophic failures by the \u00ademergency services then launched a grotesque campaign of lies to blame the victims.\" It concluded: \"We've had the truth. Now for justice.\"</p> <p>This call for action was <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/ourcomments/view/345630/Facts-at-last-for-families-of-Hillsborough-victims\">echoed by the Daily Express, which said:</a> \"The response of the authorities cannot end there. Those who were complicit in these disgraceful acts must be held to account for their behaviour.\"</p> <p>And <a href=\"http://www.dailystar.co.uk/starsays/view/271957/Hillsborough-lies-a-disgrace/\">the Daily Star said similarly: </a>\"Sorry is not enough.

In short, it found a cover-up.\"</p> <p>The Guardian also referred to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-report-contempt-coverup-editorial\">\"a great cloaking cover-up\"</a> and after asking \"how on earth it was allowed to stand\" came up with an answer: it had occurred \"with the connivance of several pillars of an establishment.\" </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396076548\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347521961210/The_Guardian_13_9_2012.jpg\" alt=\"gua\" width=\"174\" height=\"262\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It believed \"all sorts\" of legal follow-ups could now occur, such as \"charges for perverting the course of justice, perhaps, or fresh negligence claims from the vindicated families.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/editorial-finally-proof-of-the-hillsborough-coverup-8131226.html\">The Independent was certain that there should be action:</a> \"After truth should come justice... That must mean re-opening the inquests into the Hillsborough deaths. It must mean criminal proceedings against senior police officers and others, for perverting the course of justice or misconduct in public office.\" </p> <p>The Indy also <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/i-doubted-this-day-would-come-but-the-hillsborough-families-never-gave-up-8131295.html\">carried Oa moving piece by James Lawton</a>, an eye-witness to the unfolding of events at Hillsborough. In two sentences he explained why the Liverpool campaigners had refused to give up over 23 years despite pleas for them \"to move on.\"</p> <blockquote> <p>\"But how do you move on when you know you will never be able to calm the rage inside you? Where is there to go but a daily sense of your betrayal of those loved ones so needlessly lost?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Lawton added that \"the fury\" driving the bereaved \"was the appalling sense that the meaning of their relatives' lives had been so easily brushed aside by an uncaring establishment willing to sacrifice every value but the reputation of those who were most responsible.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396076549\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347522005227/The_Independent_13_9_2012.jpg\" alt=\"ind\" width=\"173\" height=\"235\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There was no editorial in the Daily Telegraph, but <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/9539741/Hillsborough-report-this-was-the-most-important-day-in-Liverpools-history-says-Alan-Hansen.html\">an article by former Liverpool footballer, Alan Hansen,</a> who was in the team that played at Hillsborough. He wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I have encountered ignorance about Hillsborough on many occasions, finding myself having to correct the inaccurate version of events. Recently I was at an event when the tragedy became a topic of conversation. 'Yes, but really. It was the Liverpool fans who were responsible wasn't it,' I was told.</p> <p>You can put straight those who say this, but then feel deeply disturbed that such a view still exists. How could anyone fail to know the fans were blameless in 1989? But regardless of how angry I feel hearing such views expressed, what must the families have suffered hearing similar for 23 years?</p> <p>The report explicitly removes the excuse of ignorance for those who misunderstood the tragedy. Each sentence in it reads as a tribute to the honesty, integrity and dignity of the families and is an acknowledgement of everything they have been saying since those first, scurrilous accusations surfaced.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And then, of course, there is that Sun editorial, which is headlined <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/sun_says/4508014/The-Sun-says-We-are-sorry-for-our-gravest-error.html\">\"We are sorry for our gravest error.\"</a> </p> <blockquote> <p>\"The Sun's reporting of the Hillsborough tragedy 23 years ago is without doubt the blackest day in this newspaper's history.</p> <p>The Hillsborough Independent Panel's report into the disaster lays bare the disgraceful attempt by South Yorkshire Police to hide their culpability behind a smokescreen of lies.</p> <p>It highlights a concerted campaign by senior officers to smear the innocent by fabricating lurid allegations about Liverpool fans \u2014 and then feeding them to the media.</p> <p>But it is to the eternal discredit of The Sun that we reported as fact this misinformation which tarnished the reputation of Liverpool fans including the 96 victims.</p> <p>Today we unreservedly apologise to the Hillsborough victims, their families, Liverpool supporters, the city of Liverpool and all our readers for that misjudgment.</p> <p>The role of a newspaper is to uncover injustice. To forensically examine the claims made by those who are in positions of power. In the aftermath of the Hillsborough tragedy we failed. And by failing in our duty we heaped more misery on the families of those who lost their lives and the people of Liverpool.</p> <p>Nothing can excuse The Sun's Page One presentation, under the headline The Truth. It was inaccurate, grossly insensitive and offensive. This version of events was NOT the truth.</p> <p>Today, thanks to the hard and painful work of the Panel, led by the Bishop of Liverpool the Right Reverend James Jones, we know the REAL truth.</p> <p>The vast majority of current employees did not work for this newspaper in April 1989. Many were still at school. Some were not even born.</p> <p>But we do not seek to use that to hide from the reality that a newspaper that prides itself on serving ordinary hard-working people betrayed their trust 23 years ago.</p> <p>The people of Liverpool may never forgive us for the injustice we did them. All we can do is offer them an unreserved and heartfelt apology that is profound, sincere and unambiguous.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As I said above, I accept the sincerity of this apology. It is fair to say that, in the face of the report, the paper could do little else. After all, The Sun's editor at the time, Kelvin MacKenzie, had swiftly issued an apology, accepting that he was in the wrong.</p> <p>His reputation may never recover. As for The Sun itself, its reputation - already damaged by post-hacking developments - is at its lowest ebb. So has it done enough with today's issue to ensure that it doesn't suffer a loss of readers?</p>",
  "<p>One of the myths of communication is that if a manager tells an employee what to do, then the job is done. This old idea of command and control falls short in a world of complex interactions where followers demand more from their leaders.</p> <p>The chief executives on the panel at the recent <a href=\"http://www.sol2012.co.uk/programme/\" title=\"\">SOLWorld2012 conference at Keble College, Oxford</a> agreed that big sticks don't work anymore.</p> <p>What's important in times of fast and constant change is a sensitivity for noticing small differences. These differences \u2013 times when someone does their job exceptionally well, for example \u2013 are instances of what's wanted in the organisation. Leaders can capitalise by letting staff know that they appreciate these practices and by spreading them to colleagues.</p> <p>The conference topic of sharing steps to success highlighted a solutions-focused approach to change, which is being used by several local authorities in the UK. One of the panel, Andy Couldrick, chief executive of Wokingham council, has been championing this approach after trying many other models. It is more successful, he said, because it involved the people on the frontline in redesigning how work was done and resulted in them being more connected to the organisation and concerned about playing a part in its success.</p> <p>\"It's a constant challenge to maintain enthusiasm and staff engagement in local authorities because everyone expects services to work well as a matter of course, and you only get noticed on the occasions when things go wrong,\" Couldrick said. \"When they go wrong, with well-publicised child protection failures, for example, the focus is on finding fault and assigning blame. Yet big failures are actually very rare, and most services are well run most of the time.\" He said a focus on solutions enabled the council to consider its successes and acknowledge how well it does much of its work. \"It is more usual for our glass to be half-empty, constantly buffeted by negative publicity and criticism.\" Couldrick said the change in approach had already resulted in better engagement, greater focus and motivation and better outcomes.</p> <p>This point about engagement was echoed by fellow panellist Tim Grier, chief executive of facilities company John Laing Integrated Services, which runs many public sector contracts. Grier said that company management meetings now start by talking about successes and achievements, rather than what had not been done well. \"This solutions-focused approach is much more motivating and encouraging,\" he said. \"People are also more focused. When a business goes through rapid growth, sometimes it's easy to lose sight of the objectives.\"</p> <p>Grier said his company has been using solutions-focused coaching since 2008 as part of its contract to run libraries and parks in the London borough of Hounslow. \"With over 300 staff moving from a charitable trust to a private sector employer delivering key frontline public services, developing a common language and a focus on solutions rather than problems has generated significant improvement in management and staff effectiveness,\" he said, and had contributed to the overall lower cost of running the service.</p> <p>The solutions-focused philosophy has its roots in 1970s family therapy in the US, when leading-edge therapists such as Steve de Shazer and Insoo Kim Berg realised that it was not necessary to analysesomeone's problems in order to help them improve their life. The therapists asked individuals to describe their preferred future and helped them take steps towards it. The solutions-focused methodology is now an internationally recognised approach. As well as being used in coaching, it has been applied to complexproblems such as managing change, making quality and service improvements, and transforming corporate culture.</p> <p>Reviewing a two-year project to implement this approach throughout Reading borough council's department of children's and education services, Michael Coughlin, chief executive of the borough at the time, said participants in the programme included school improvement managers, social workers, parenting specialists and child action team members. \"They have learned to hold conversations which are carefully structured to unlock the wealth of knowledge and experience within the professionals and the families they work with\".</p> <p>A notable feature of the Reading programme was the central role of a new virtual team of solutions-focused champions, drawn from areas such as schools, youth services and children's actions teams. Each of these began by creating aproject designed to make a positive impact on a selected aspect of their work. They then applied the techniques and measured the impacts, showing improved results (and savings) in many services and in internal measures such as reduction of stress levels, increased engagement and even ratings of training courses.</p> <p>For Coughlin, the appeal of the approach lies in its simplicity. \"It is easy to understand, and at least basic implementation was possible without changing a great deal else about what we do,\" he said. \"It encourages small steps to build on what is already working. This emphasis on the importance of keeping much of what is already going on is attractive to staff who may be tired of fad-like initiatives that offer little impact.\"</p> <p><em>Paul Z Jackson is an organisational consultant</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>A fresh inquest into the Hillsborough disaster is likely to be ordered after the full scale of the establishment cover-up over the 1989 disaster was revealed for the first time.</p> <p>Criminal prosecutions of key figures are also possible after the <a href=\"http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Hillsborough Independent Panel</a> \u2013 which was chaired by the bishop of Liverpool, James Jones, and had unrestricted access to 450,000 documents over three years \u2013 revealed the depth of a police cover-up that swung into action the morning after the disaster.</p> <p>It confirmed Lord Justice Taylor's key finding in August 1989 that the main reason for the disaster was a \"failure in police control\".</p> <p>But it also revealed that \"multiple failures\" in other emergency services and public bodies contributed to the death toll. Similarly, serious failings in the inquests and reviews that followed prolonged the agony of the families of the victims.</p> <p>Legal representatives for the families of the 96 victims crushed to death at the Leppings Lane end of the ground said that South Yorkshire police, Sheffield city council and Sheffield Wednesday FC could all face charges for corporate manslaughter.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the attorney general, Dominic Grieve, will decide in the coming weeks whether to order a new inquest after the original, which recorded a verdict of accidental death, was found by the panel to be severely lacking.</p> <p>\"If David Cameron means what he says and justice has to follow truth, then they have a responsibility today to assess not just the question of unlawful killing but the cover-up and the perversion of the course of justice,\" said Michael Mansfield QC, who is acting on behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG).</p> <p>The panel discovered that as many as 41 victims of the disaster on 15 April 1989 might have been saved had the emergency response been better. They also found that 116 of the 164 police statements taken afterwards were doctored to show the police in a better light, and that the South Yorkshire ambulance service had also altered statements to deflect criticism.</p> <p>An earlier inquest by Dr Stefan Popper had controversially imposed a cut-off time of 3.15pm which, said the report, \"led to the mistaken belief that an effective emergency services intervention could not have saved lives\".</p> <p>The coroner ordered that blood alcohol levels be taken for each of the deceased. The panel found that the weight placed on alcohol levels was \"inappropriate and misleading\" and the pattern of alcohol consumption \"unremarkable\".</p> <p>The report says blood alcohol levels were taken from survivors for no apparent medical reason and that attempts were made to \"impugn the reputation of the deceased\" by checking whether they had criminal records.</p> <p>\"What was new and a shock was how many of them could have been saved. That is the most important thing. I'll go home and wonder if James was one of them,\" said Margaret Aspinall, chair of the HFSG, whose son James was 18 when he died.</p> <p>\"They were the liars and we were the truthful ones, we were the innocent. To hear that apology doesn't make us feel better. We will always be the losers at Hillsborough,\" she said.</p> <p>The prime minister, David Cameron, said in the Commons he was \"profoundly sorry\" on behalf of the government for what was immediately described by the former lord chancellor Charles Falconer as \"a concerted conspiracy to withhold the truth\" over a disaster that claimed the lives of 96 men, women and children, 80% of whom were under 30.</p> <p>Cameron said: \"With the weight of the new evidence in the report, it's right for me today as prime minister to make a proper apology to the families of the 96. On behalf of the government, and indeed of our country, I am profoundly sorry that this double injustice has been left uncorrected for so long.\"</p> <p>Falconer, who is also advising the families, said he expected the attorney general to order a new inquest into the deaths:. \"It is absolutely clear there is no other step he can take,\" he said.</p> <p>The panel, constituted in 2009 on the initiative of the then Labour ministers Andy Burnham and Maria Eagle and in the wake an articleby the Guardian's David Conn, found that 116 of 164 statements supplied by South Yorkshire police in response to the disaster were changed to \"remove or alter comments directly unfavourable to South Yorkshire police\". In the days after the disaster, a narrative took hold that drunken Liverpool fans had caused the disaster by forcing a gate open. Allegations were printed that Liverpool fans had pickpocketed the dead and hampered rescue attempts in an infamous Sun front page headlined \"The Truth\", which led to a boycott of the paper on Merseyside that continues today. The Sun editor at the time, Kelvin MacKenzie, on Wednesday offered \"profuse apologies\" for the first time.</p> <p>The panel found that the origin of untrue claims was a Sheffield news agency informed by four senior South Yorkshire police officers, a South Yorkshire Police Federation spokesperson and a local MP, Irvine Patnick.</p> <p>The day the Sun allegations were published, the report describes a meeting of the South Yorkshire police federation in the Pickwick restaurant in Sheffield.</p> <p>At the meeting, the chief constable, Peter Wright, who died last year, said officers should not talk to the media and should \"prepare a rock solid story\". He said the force needed to take control of the narrative presented to the inquiry and that \"if anybody should be blamed, it should be the drunken, ticketless individuals\".</p> <p>\"When you get the chief constable sitting down with his trade union to cobble together a solid story, then you know we've reached a new depth of depravity,\" said Trevor Hicks, who lost two daughters, Sarah and Victoria, at Hillsborough and is president of the HFSG.</p> <p>\"There were two disasters at Hillsborough. The one on the day and the one afterwards. It was not only a disaster, it was a contrived, manipulated, vengeful and spiteful attempt to shift the blame.\"</p> <p>The 395-page report also outlines the extent to which repeated warnings over the safety of the ground were ignored and uncovers a Health and Safety Executive report that found neither the club nor the council had heeded warnings from a series of near misses in previous years.</p> <p>Hicks also called on Norman Bettison, the current chief constable in West Yorkshire, to resign. He has consistently denied being involved in the operation to smear Liverpool fans, but the panel found that he was involved.</p> <p>Falconer admitted that the families and the survivors of Hillsborough had been failed by \"successive governments including the one of which I was a part\".</p> <p>In documents disclosed to the panel, the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, was briefed that \"the defensive \u2013 and at times close to deceitful \u2013 behaviour by senior officers in South Yorkshire sounds depressingly familiar\".</p> <p>While there was no direct evidence that Thatcher or the cabinet was complicit in a cover-up, it is revealed that the primary concern of the government at the time was the impact of the disaster on its proposed football spectators bills.</p>",
  "<p>Green-belt land in England should be freed up for new housing developments, according to a centre-right thinktank established by the new planning minister, Nick Boles.</p> <p>In a report which warns of a \"failing cycle\" on planning, Policy Exchange says releasing 2% of English land for development would allow for the building of an extra 8m homes.</p> <p>Boles was appointed to the politically sensitive post of planning minister in last week's reshuffle as the government announced plans to relax planning regulations to underwrite new housebuilding to the tune of \u00a310bn.</p> <p>But the report by Policy Exchange, the thinktank established by Boles in 2002, warns that the coalition's plans do not go far enough and the government should be prepared to build on the green belt.</p> <p>Under a headline \"There is no shortage of land in England\", the author Alex Morton writes: \"Just 6-10% of England has been developed and only 2.3% has been 'concreted over'. We can see there is no overall shortage of land, given, for example, in Oxford a hectare of land costs \u00a320,000 for agricultural purposes but \u00a34m for homes. It is artificial scarcity created by planning we are concerned with.</p> <p>\"Releasing just 2% of our land would allow 8m family homes. There is a myth we have lots of brownfield land. Such derelict land exists for 1m homes but this is only a few years supply, and is in areas we need it less. London has such land for just 30,000 homes.\"</p> <p>Morton argues that local residents should be compensated and developments should be of a high quality. \"The legitimate fears of nimbys [not in my back yard] must be acknowledged, rather than nimbys being insulted. Quality must rise to the fore. Planners and people must see we will have more Cubbitt and less Corbusier,\" he writes.</p> <p>Thomas Cubitt was London's main 19th-century master builder who developed much of Belgravia; Le Corbusier was the early 20th-century French architect responsible for modern urban developments such as the building of the new Indian city of Chandigarh.</p> <p>Boles, whose father Sir Jack Boles was head of the National Trust from 1975 to 1983, has been highly critical of its campaign against chancellor George Osborne's plans to liberalise planning laws.</p> <p>Boles <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nickbolesmp.com%2Fdownloads%2Fmacmillan-lecture-tory-reform-group-30th-january-2012.pdf&amp;ei=PM9QUPq7Hs6yhAf61oCIAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-dWeNzldH5ObbJ89UYwxM7H8Ktw\" title=\"\">told the Tory Reform Group earlier this year</a>: \"Business investment is ... deterred by the bureaucratic rigidity of our outdated planning regime. So it is essential that we press on with our planning reforms and do not allow the hysterical scaremongering of latterday Luddites like [National Trust chairman] Simon Jenkins to strangle developments that will boost living standards.\"</p> <p>The Policy Exchange report warns that Britain has a \"deeply flawed\" planning system. It says England's land market \"is more like a command economy\" because councils control the use of land.</p> <p>Morton writes: \"The UK's 'land market' is in no real sense a market. Land release is not triggered by market mechanisms but is controlled by councils through the planning system. Land release by councils is governed by plans that try to micromanage all land use within a local authority.\"</p> <p>The system prompts developers to hold back land in a process known as \"land banking\", claims Morton, adding: \"Developers land bank due to planning. They earned high profits in the 2000s from this model.</p> <p>\"Developers borrow to buy land as they think land prices will rise. This model only works when land prices are stable or rising. But land prices only rise when too little is being released to satisfy demand. By definition therefore the current model can never build enough homes over time.

  "<p>A quick burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team</p> <h2><a href=\"http://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/07/eu-to-banks-assume-all-pcs-are-infected/\">EU to banks: assume all PCs are infected &gt;&gt; Krebs on Security</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>An agency of the European Union created to improve network and data security is offering some blunt, timely and refreshing advice for financial institutions as they try to secure the online banking channel: \"Assume all PCs are infected.\"</p> </blockquote> <p> From a few weeks ago, but very relevant.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/iphone/LTE/\">iPhone 5 - View countries with supported LTE networks &gt;&gt; Apple</a></h2> <p>Worth noticing: different models exist and will work with different networks (or not) in different countries. The good news: the UK ones work in Germany, Australia, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore. </p> <h2><a href=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-33642_7-57509530-292/windows-8-gets-browser-ballot-amid-eu-antitrust-probe/\">Windows 8 gets 'browser ballot' amid EU antitrust probe | Windows 8 - CNET Reviews</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>Microsoft is pushing out an update to Windows 8 users to enable the \"browser ballot\" screen, even though the forthcoming operating system's release date is set for over a month away.</p> <p> Windows 8 users in Europe are now given the choice of which browser - including Microsoft's own Internet Explorer - they wish to install.</p> </blockquote> <p> Good for Chrome, if it has a Windows 8 Metro version. Does it?</p> <h2><a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/10/apple-as-the-last-hope-for-growth-in-business-pcs/\">Apple as the last hope for growth in business PCs &gt;&gt; NYTimes.com</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>In a broad report on global information technology spending that it plans to publish on Monday, Forrester Research estimates that government and business purchases of computers will grow a meager 1.7%, to $146.6bn, in 2012 from the year before. Forrester includes tablet computers like the iPad in its forecast; sales of iPads to businesses are booming. Forrester estimates that business spending on iPads will rise 76% to nearly $10bn this year.</p> <p> That growth, along with a 9% increase in business spending on Macs to $6.7bn, will help offset what Forrester expects to be a dismal year for PCs and tablets that run Windows.</p> </blockquote> <p> An unimaginable headline only a few years ago.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/zuckerberg-wrote-all-2179-words-of-facebooks-s-1-founder-letter-on-his-phone/\">Zuckerberg Wrote All 2,178 Words Of Facebook's S-1 Founder Letter On His Phone | TechCrunch</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>In a riveting conversation today at TechCrunch Disrupt, Zuckerberg underscored and underscored and underscored again the importance of mobile for Facebook. He gave a telling and sort of chilling anecdote, for those of us who know how difficult it is to monetize mobile: \"Want to know something sort of funny?\" he told TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington, \"You know the Founder's Letter in the S-1, well I wrote that on my phone.\"</p> <p> Zuck's feat is super impressive, considering the letter is about the size of your average MG Siegler post -- 2,178 words according to my Word document word count, if you don't include Zuckerberg's signature.</p> </blockquote> <p> It includes the letter, which is extremely long. He may have written it on the phone, but we suspect it was edited on a larger screen. But it points to a key trend: smartphones can be content creation devices for more than trivially short content. (Did he dictate it, we wonder? That would be really interesting.)</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2012/09/12/key-disclosure-laws-can-be-used-to-confiscate-bitcoin-assets/\">Key disclosure laws can be used to confiscate Bitcoin assets &gt;&gt; Forbes</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>Key disclosure laws may become the most important government tool in asset seizures and the war on money laundering. When charged with a criminal offense, that refers to the ability of the government to demand that you surrender your private encryption keys that decrypt your data. If your data is currency such as access control to various amounts of bitcoin on the block chain, then you have surrendered your financial transaction history and potentially the value itself.</p> </blockquote> <p> There's bound to be some good news about BitCoin out there somewhere, surely?</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/12/13/what_alec_baldwin_doesnt_know_about_air_travel/\">What Alec Baldwin doesn't know about air travel &gt;&gt; Salon.com</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>Can a cellphone really interfere with a plane's systems and avionics? The answer is that it's highly unlikely, but possible. That's not the answer you want, I know, but like almost everything in commercial aviation, it depends. For example, although a plane's electronics are designed with interference in mind, if the shielding is old or faulty there's a greater potential for trouble.</p> </blockquote> <p> We've sailed around this buoy before; if the shielding is old or faulty, it needs replacing for reasons other than phones. The key reason to ban hard-edged objects flying around the cabin if there's an emergency.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/12/3319822/tube-map-radio-yuri-suzuki\">Designer builds functioning radio with London tube map circuit board &gt;&gt; The Verge</a></h2> <p>The first clickbait headline ever that is not controversial.

One was \"inertial scrolling\"--when you flick at a list of items on the screen, the list moves as a function of how fast you swipe, and then it comes to rest slowly, as if being affected by real-world inertia. Another was the \"rubber-band effect,\" which causes a list to bounce against the edge of the screen when there were no more items to display. When Jobs saw the prototype, he thought, \"My god, we can build a phone out of this,\" he told the D Conference in 2010.</p> </blockquote> <p>You can follow <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:guardiantech\">Guardian Technology's linkbucket on Pinboard</a>.
