Louisiana officials said they would intentionally breach a levee in Placquemines parish, south of New Orleans, as Isaac lumbered inland from the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>Authorities feared many residents would need help after a night of torrential rain and harsh winds knocked out power to more than 700,000 households and businesses.</p> <p>Isaac has top sustained winds of 70mph (112kph), just below the hurricane threshold of 74mph (119kph).</p> <p>Army Corps spokeswoman Rachel Rodi said the city's bigger, stronger levees were withstanding the assault. \"The system is performing as intended, as we expected,\" she said. \"We don't see any issues with the hurricane system at this point.\"</p> <p>New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu issued a curfew for the city. Police cars had been patrolling the nearly empty streets since Isaac began bringing fierce winds and heavy rains to the city Tuesday night.</p> <p>Rescuers in boats and trucks plucked a handful of people who became stranded by floodwaters in thinly populated areas of south-east Louisiana. Emergency officials in Plaquemines Parish said floodwaters had flowed over an 8ft levee between the Braithwaite and White Ditch districts. </p> <p>Authorities evacuated hundreds of families from Plaquemines on Wednesday afternoon amid fears of fresh flooding.</p> <p>Convoys of people clutching children, pets and bags streamed in driving rain down state highway 23 while a fleet of ambulances with blaring sirens headed in the opposite direction towards the Mississippi to aid people still in danger.</p> <p>A YMCA centre in Belle Chase, just south of New Orleans, became an improvised refugee station for 125 people after two other nearby shelters filled up.</p> <p>\"The waters had reached the seventh step of my porch and the lawmen told us we had to evacuate the premises,\" said Veraldine Garrison, 72, who arrived with four adult children.</p> <p>\"All we had was the wind and the rain. The wind and the rain.\" Like others, she feared for her home. \"There ain't nothing you can do with mother nature. You can't control that water.\"</p> <p>Beside her, huddled in a blanket, sat a woman rescued from her rooftop, too exhausted or traumatized to speak.</p> <p>Some evacuees complained they were forced to leave pets and valuables behind. \"My chihuahuas, Tiki and Tutu, are still in my trailer home,\" said Thomas Wyman, 80, slumped in a plastic chair. \"And my money, my medicine, it's all there.\"</p> <p>Jim Gabour, who lives in the Faubourg Marigny neighborhood of New Orleans, just next to the French Quarter, said that with electricity knocked out, trees downed and the wind still up, residents were in survivalist mode \u2013 and did not expect relief until the weekend.</p> <p>\"No electricity, no running water and 80mph gusts,\" Gabour wrote in an email on Wednesday. \"Right now, cutting trees off house in high winds and stinging rains. Cell batteries gone soon. Land lines not working.\"</p> <p>He added later: \"Generator too erratic for computer. No electricity, cable or land lines until weekend. Will have to turn off generator soon, and be in dark again, as we have to ration gas and no stations open. And it is suffocatingly hot.\"</p>",
  "<p>On 17 July, President Barack Obama spoke at a campaign rally in Roanoke, Virginia. It was a typical event for an incumbent president who is seeking a second term. <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/07/13/remarks-president-campaign-event-roanoke-virginia\">In his remarks</a>, he offered his vision of government's role in spurring entrepreneurship and creating jobs in the United States:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business \u2013 you didn't build that.&#xa0;Somebody else made that happen. The internet didn't get invented on its own. Government research created the internet so that all the companies could make money off the internet.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This is all fairly boilerplate rhetoric \u2013 a basic recitation of how Democrats view the role of government and its interplay with the private sector. But in this statement, there was one phrase that Republicans have grabbed on to like a famished dog with a new bone:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"You didn't build that.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That single phrase, taken out of context by Republicans, has become the GOP's symbol of Obama's supposed contempt for the free market and entrepreneurship, and for his socialist assault on America. Sure, it's a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/26/mitt-romney/putting-mitt-romneys-attacks-you-didnt-build-truth/\">misleading lie</a> to cast it that way. But in the hands of Republicans intent on furthering their vision of the free market as a fragile institution whose success relies on as little interaction with the federal government as possible, it quickly became a stand-in for all that is wrong with Obama.</p> <p>And so, the Republicans made \"We built that\" the theme of Tuesday's convention proceedings. Speaker after speaker hammered on this theme, accusing Obama of disrespecting small business. But they did so with almost a wilful sense of hypocrisy. For example, Delaware lieutenant governor candidate <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/rnc-primetime-speaker-gave-extensive-powerpoint-on\">Sher Valenzuela&#xa0;attacked</a> Obama for the line despite the fact that, just a few months ago, she gave a detailed speech to a business group about how they could do a better job getting government contracts.</p> <p>The shining example, however, was <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/28/phil-archuletta-gop-convention_n_1838173.html\">Phil Archuletta</a>, a New Mexico businessman whose business makes outdoor signs \u2013 in part, for the federal government. Archuletta's chief complaint against the president was that Obama's stimulus bill had made it harder for him to win government contracts \u2013 an odd message for an evening dedicated to the notion that small businesses need government to get out of the way.</p> <p>Democratic partisans were busy tweeting out the fact that Obama has signed multiple pieces of legislation providing tax breaks for small businesses, but such \"facts\" simply bounce harmlessly off the GOP's protective truth shield. Indeed, if there is one overarching takeaway, not only from the sessions so far at the Republican convention, but also from the last year of political campaigning, it is that Republicans not only toil in their own narrowly and misleadingly constructed world, but really are just <em>making stuff up</em>.</p> <p>There were plenty of instances on display last night, beyond the \"you didn't build it\" meme. The most pernicious and racially-coded example is the oft-repeated claim by the Romney campaign that Obama, by granting waivers to states, has gutted the work requirement of the welfare reform bill (passed more than 15 years ago). The charge has become a crucial element of Romney's attacks on the president, even though, as many independent fact-checkers have pointed out, it simply isn't true. It's another lie; and yet, it was repeated last night by former Democratic Congressman Artur Davis, and again, by failed presidential candidate Rick Santorum, who went a step further and accused Obama of creating a \"nightmare of dependency\".</p> <p>These are the big lies; but there are so many other ones that it's almost impossible to keep track. For example, speaker after speaker denounced Obama for running up $5tn in debt. While budget deficits that have increased the national debt have occurred during Obama's presidency, only someone who believes history began on 20 January 2009 (when Obama took office) can think he is fully responsible.</p> <p>As this handy <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/28/republican-national-convention-the-one-graph-you-need-to-see-before-watching/\">chart, put together by the folks at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a>, the debt is a result of a confluence of factors: the Bush tax cuts, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the decline in tax revenue from the economic downturn, Tarp, and \u2013 very slightly \u2013 recovery measures put in place by President Obama. Republicans have completely washed their hands of any role and any responsibility for America's ever-increasing red tape \u2013 and it should be noted that the budgets of both Romney and Ryan (when he served in the House) would, because of massive tax cuts, further explode the deficit.</p> <p>Republicans also decry the president's jobs record and they certainly have a point, but again, to blame Obama for 8% unemployment is to ignore the fact that Congress exists: it has regularly blocked any and all job creation measures ever since Obama's stimulus bill, which did create about 2.5 million jobs. </p> <p>Then, there are assertions like keynote speaker New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's claim that Americans are \"overtaxed\", even thought the tax burden on taxpayers is at its lowest point since the Truman administration \u2013 and Obama has repeatedly cut taxes as president. Indeed, as Tom Schaller, a political scientist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) said to me:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Republicans say they value low taxes and hard work but fought until the 11th hour against the only tax levied directly on work: the payroll tax.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But all of this is at pace with a conservative worldview that considers government to be nothing more than malevolent interference with the smooth operation of the private sector \u2013 except when it's not. \"Jobs don't come from government,\" said Texas Senate candidate Ted Cruz last night, a view that basically sums up GOP economic thinking. But if you listened to Republican governors on Tuesday, you might have found yourself surprised to discover that, in their states, the government has played an oddly integral role in spurring job creation. If you listened to Mary Fallin, governor of Oklahoma, extol the virtues of the energy industry in her state and bemoan \"more government, bigger spending and more regulation\", you might never know that the oil and gas industry is deeply reliant on \u2013 and spends millions lobbying for \u2013 tax breaks from the federal government.</p> <p>One can believe that government should play a less direct role in the workings of the private economy \u2013 clearly, this is a defensible notion. But to listen to Republicans harping on Obama's \"you didn't build that\" line is to hear a party that views \"government\" in the most simplistic imaginable terms. This isn't a governing philosophy; it's a caricature of how the economy actually works.</p> <p>To be sure, it's hardly unusual for political rhetoric to take liberties with the truth, or to stretch an argument to breaking-point, but with Republicans today, the issues runs much deeper. Very simply, the way they talk about what the federal government does or should do, and about the role of spending, taxation and regulation, is more than just a compendium of lies: it describes an alternate reality.</p> <p>In the GOP's defense: at least they can argue they built that.</p> <p>\u2022 Editor's note: this article originally identified Mary Fallin as governor of Nebraska; this was amended to Oklahoma at 12.30am on 30 August 2012.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was further amended on 3 September 2012 to clarify Thomas Schaller's affiliation.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Paul will be here shortly. Kick-off it at 9.30pm UK time. And to get in the mood for the game, here are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/29/real-madrid-luka-modric-position\">some words from Sid Lowe</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Luka Modric's papers have been cleared in time for tonight's Super Copa second leg against Barcelona. But Mourinho, like Modric, appeared to rule out his involvement \u2013 at least from the start. \"He has only played a few minutes in a friendly in Croatia,\" Mourinho said. \"He will be ready in a short time. Because of his characteristics he is not the kind of player that takes a long time to be fit.\"</p> <p>Madrid trail 3-2 from the first leg against Barcelona and were defeated 2-1 by Getafe at the weekend, meaning that they have opened the season without a win in three games \u2013 the worst start to a season Mourinho has endured in his career. But the coach claimed that Madrid did not have to change anything they had done in the first leg against Barcelona. He did though hint at his irritation with his players for the way that they performed on Sunday night.</p> <p>\"I have spoken to the players but I have got nothing to say [to the media] about that,\" he said. \"We met, I told them what I had to say but I do not want to tell you. It does not matter to me whether we win or not, what I want to know is whether the psychological profile that we showed against Getafe is just a temporary thing or the product of a psychological mind-set that has been building up. We can lose. The fundamental thing for me is to see what players I have got and what psychological profile they have.\"</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Teams: <br>Real:</strong> Casillas; Arbeloa, Pepe, Ramos, Marcelo; Alonso, Khedira; Di Mar\u00eda, \u00d6zil, Cristiano; Higua\u00edn<br><strong>Subs</strong>: Ad\u00e1n, Benzema, Albiol, Modric, Callej\u00f3n, Diarra, Nacho</p> <p><strong>Bar\u00e7a</strong>: Vald\u00e9s, Alba, Adriano, Mascherano, Piqu\u00e9; Busquets, Xavi, Iniesta; Alexis, Messi y Pedro<br><strong>Subs</strong>: F\u00e1bregas, Villa, Pinto, Bartra, Alex Song, Tello, Montoya</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>9.27pm:</strong> Out stomp the teams to the operatic stylings of some hired songsters. The Bernabeau looks jammed, which suggests fans' appetites have not been diluted by the fact that these teams have faced each other about 47 times over the last year or so. Perhaps they've all come to see Alex Song?</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> We have kick-off. Song and Modric watch from the benches as the first minute passes off with so much as a strop by any of the protagonists.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Iniesta slips the ball wide to Pedro, who crosses first time from the right. Rather than challenge for it, Alexis hurls himself to the ground as if dodging gun fire and bays for a penalty. The nearby Marcelo pour scorn on him, as do the crowd. \"Do you know anything about this Nacho guy on the bench for Real?\" parps Asa Desouza. Apparently he's a left-back from their youth team, drafted in because of the suspension of Contreao.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Marcelo threads a fine pass between Mascherano and Piqu\u00e9, presenting Higuain with a wonderful one-on-one opportunity. But the striker bangs the ball straight at Valdes.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Ronaldo attempts to make his first meaningful contribution of the night but is quickly crowded out. Bar\u00e7a then twinkle t heir way forward and attempt to stimulate something from Messi, who has been as subdued as his Portuguese counterpart so far. Nothing happens.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Real 1-0 Bar\u00e7a (agg: 3-3) (Higuain 11')</strong> Mascherano does a Bramble under an elementary hoik from the back by Real, allowing Higuain to race through and fire past the exposed Valdes from 15 yards. They're level on aggregate.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> Mascherano's woes continue as he cops a deserved booking for hauling down Di Maria wide on the right. Incidentally, Celtic will be in the Champions League draw alongside both of these team on Friday, after goals from Hooper and Wanyama gave them a 2-0 win over Helsinborg tonight to make it 4-0 on aggregate.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Bar\u00e7a are uncharacteristically scruffy at the moment. Mascherano is the most obvious flounderer but all of the team is guilty of giving the ball away sloppily and being slower than their opponents into tackles.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> Marcelo sends a fizzer jsut past the post from 18 yards as Real retain the upper hand.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> \"Been a slow start to the season for Messi, don't you think?\" tuts Simon McMahon. \"Only five goals in three games, and not one hat-trick. Looks a shadow of the player he was last season.\" You'[re absolutely right: I fully expect him to be sold to QPR by Friday.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Real 2-0 Bar\u00e7a (agg: 4-3) (Ronaldo 18') </strong><br>Ay caramba! Aren't Real supposed to be the team in crisis? Barcelona have been an absolute shambles so far and Real have helped themselves to an aggregate lead. Again a simple long ball from the back exposed a gaping hole in the Bar\u00e7a defence, then Ronaldo flicked the ball beautifully over the bewildered Piqu\u00e9 and sent a reasonable shot into the net via a deflection.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> Valdes saves Bar\u00e7a from falling further behind! Again his defence doddered about as Real zipped between them and offered yet another one-on-one to Higuain, who was thwarted by the goalkeeper.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Real have a goal wrongly disallowed! Pepe nodded a freekick into the net but the referee ruled it out, seemingly for offside ... but no one was offside.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> RED CARD! Bar\u00e7a's implosion continues apace as Adriano is rightly sent off for pulling down Ronaldo as yet another straight-forward ball from the back led to a clear Real chance.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> This is like one of those Champions League games where Real run merry rings around some misfortunate minnows from Belarus or some such: Bar\u00e7a could be on the end of an unprecedented hammering if they don't pull themselves together.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> Barcelona substitution: Sanchez is replaced by Montoya as Bar\u00e7a attempt some running repairs to their team in the wake of the red card and dog-awful start.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Some good play by Mascherano! His perfectly-timed last-ditch tackle prevented Higuain from unleashing yet another shot at Higuain after Real had again presented him with a clear chance.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> Complete silence in the stadium denotes a scoring chance for Barcelona: Iniesta, inevitably, created, curling an inviting ball towards the back post. Montoya darted in to try to apply a killer touch but narrowly missed it.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Bar\u00e7a have located their spine and some stability ensues. They've enjoyed a couple of minutes of possession ... but so far failed to show any real signs of penetration. Messi is so far off the boil he could be in a fridge.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Real 2-1 Bar\u00e7a (agg: 4-4) (Messi 44')</strong> <br>Messi storms out of the fridge in spectacular style! He equalises on aggregrate with a sublime 28-yard freekick into the top corner. Shaun Wright-Phillips' place at QPR may be safe yet...</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>45+1 min:</strong> Anything Messi can do, Ronaldo can ... almost do. Moments after the Argentinian's wonderful strike, Ronaldo seizes possesion in midfield, twists his way into shooting range ... and sends splendid swirler inches wide.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> Anything could happen after the break.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>Whimsy:</strong><br>\"Does it matter whether you are two goals down and have 10, nine, eight or even less players on the pitch if one of those players is Lionel Messi?\" wonders Thoams Boschat. \"As long as he is on the pitch any team he is playing for is always in with more than shout.\" </p> <p>\"Good work as always, Paul,\" smarms Anna Pons. \"However. Madrid's goal from the free kick was correctly disallowed for a push by Pepe on Mascherano. As Pepe didn't really protest I think we can assume the ref called it right.\" If that was the reason for disallowing it, then it was still incorrect, as there was no push by Pepe, who merely a slight brushing against. Mascherno fall was laughable.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Barcelona get the second half going. No changes by either side during the interval.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>48 min: </strong> More mewling and spewing as Pedro tumbles to the ground under a whiff of contact from Ronaldo. Contemptible.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Piqu\u00e9 booked for handball near the corner flag. Alonso whips it in the freekick but Piqu\u00e9 atones for his error by clearing.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> This game is as finely poised as the score suggests. Barcelona have composed themselves after their ridiculous start and, despite being a man down, are looking quite solid. And they carry danger on the break, albeit a mostly latent one so far.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> The game has lapsed into a sort of paralysis, as neither team can shift the other. The camera keeps panning to Alex Song on the bench, seemingly convinced that he could be the man to spark things up.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> Probing continues, mainly by Bar\u00e7a, who are making light of their numerical inferiority. \"I am pretty sure Messi could come on at half time for Young CS Buftea and turn the game around,\" chortles Tera Gear, in reference to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/29/romanian-club-beaten-31-0?INTCMP=SRCH\">this</a>.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> After a lengthy bout of keep ball, Mascherano picked out Pedro with a fine pass over the top from deep ... and Casillas rescues Real with an equally fine block.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Khedira booked for cynically bringingdown Messi to concede a freekick well within Messi's range. But this time the little wizard flumps his shot into the wall.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Ozil tries to inject some zest into a Real side that has been curiously passive in this second period. The German scampers down the left before turning back in search of support.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Real are struggling to find any urgency. \"That paralysis you experienced on 55 mins is more commonly known as the 'Barca Trance' whereby viewers are rendered immobile for the period of time in which consecutive passes are made as the opposition cannot get near the ball,\" lectures Peter Crosby. \"There is the slightly less powerful \"Spanish Trance\" which is not a new genre of club music but more the ability of their national football team to lull opponents and viewers into a deep dreamless sleep for approximately 90 minutes at a time. It's spectacular, if only you could keep your eyes open.\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Seemingly fed up with the sloth around him, Khedira seizes the ball in midfield and embarks on a marauding run forward and all the way into the Bar\u00e7a box, where he is ultimately foiled by Valdes. Will his incursion at least encourage Real to be a bit more assertive? They've been pretty negative since Bar\u00e7a's goal.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> Sergio Ramos becomes the latest player to be cautioned as he clatters into Messi on mid-way.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Barcelona change: here comes Alex Song, in place of Busquets.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Jordi Alba makes a brilliant curved run around the back of the Real defence nas is picked out by Messi. With his first touch the left-back takes it past Casillas, but Seergio Ramos intervenes tidily to save Real.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Real subtitution: Di Maria off, Callejon on.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> What a miss! Suddenly we were taken back to the early stages of the game as a simple throughball found Higuain in acres of space in front of Valdes. As he sized up his shot, Mascherano scrambled sufficiently to stick out a leg and divert it on to the post and out for a corner!</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Real change: Higuain comes off having scored one but botched at least four other great chances. Benzema will try to do better.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Real change: Ozil off ... and on comes Luka Modric. Presumably when seeking advice on how to make an impact on your Real debut, Modric put in a call to his old Tottenham chum, Jonathan Woodgate ...</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Bar\u00e7a get a freekick 40 yards from goal and that's their cue to try their old tactic of bringing up the big men from the back and launching it into the mixer. That yields a corner. Then another one. Then Casillas punches the ball clear. \"A Song 25?\" chirps Neil Reeve. \"I can't help thinking the answer to the crossword clue that just joined the game is The Wreck Of The Edmund Fitzgerald.\"</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Ronaldo shot. Valdes save. Just the facts.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>90+1 min:</strong> Benzema cuts the ball back to Modric, who attempts to mark his debut with the winning goal ... but his 18-yard drive is beaten away by Valdes.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>90+2 min:</strong> It's a frantic finish, as Casillas has to bat away a decent effort by Montoya. Moments later Song controls the ball on his chest just outside the Real box and then plays a cute ball to Messi, who shuffles before whacking a shot inches wide.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>Full-time:</strong> Real win on away goals!</p>",
  "<p>While a tropical storm batters the Gulf coast and Republicans make their case for reclaiming the White House, Barack Obama diverted attention from both by typing three simple words on Wednesday afternoon: \"ask me anything.\" </p> <p>When a politician needs to relate better to an unsure public, secret weapons include wives, friends, pets and \u2013&#xa0;if you're Bill Clinton \u2013 brass musical instruments.

And so he appeared out of nowhere on the Reddit message board \u2013 as <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/PresidentObama\">PresidentObama</a> \u2013 fielding questions from people who want to know about everything from Gitmo to the White House beer recipe (\"It will be out soon!

Users can cast a vote to send story links and comments up or down. The best content, in theory, rises to the top of each subreddit. </p> <p>Though Wednesday was certainly a moment in the sun, Reddit has managed to stay largely out of the mainstream. For first-time visitors, the shorthand takes awhile to understand. \"AMA\" for instance, stands for Ask Me Anything, one of the more mainstream features on the site, where anyone can put themselves forward to be questioned about their area of interest of expertise.</p> <p>Celebrities and politicians alike have attempted to let the asking public pelt them with questions \u2013 with varying degrees of success, as some of the more overly self-promoting users have found out the hard way. (No word yet if Obama's \"Don't forget to vote in November!\" went over well with the community.) </p> <p>And today, Obama's \"AMA\" soared to the top of Reddit itself. </p> <p>Here is a selection of his answers from the chat, exactly as they appeared on Reddit: </p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60n8iu\">On troop surge in Afghanistan:</a> </h2> <p>The decision to surge our forces in afghanistan. Any time you send our brave men and women into battle, you know that not everyone will come home safely, and that necessarily weighs heavily on you. The decision did help us blunt the taliban's momentum, and is allowing us to transition to afghan lead - so we will have recovered that surge at the end of this month, and will end the war at the end of 2014. But knowing of the heroes that have fallen is something you never forget.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60n24k\">On internet legislation:</a></h2> <p>Internet freedom is something I know you all care passionately about; I do too. We will fight hard to make sure that the internet remains the open forum for everybody - from those who are expressing an idea to those to want to start a business. And although their will be occasional disagreements on the details of various legislative proposals, I won't stray from that principle - and it will be reflected in the platform.</p> <h2>On money in politics:</h2> <p>Money has always been a factor in politics, but we are seeing something new in the no-holds barred flow of seven and eight figure checks, most undisclosed, into super-PACs; they fundamentally threaten to overwhelm the political process over the long run and drown out the voices of ordinary citizens. We need to start with passing the Disclose Act that is already written and been sponsored in Congress - to at least force disclosure of who is giving to who. We should also pass legislation prohibiting the bundling of campaign contributions from lobbyists. Over the longer term, I think we need to seriously consider mobilizing a constitutional amendment process to overturn Citizens United (assuming the Supreme Court doesn't revisit it). Even if the amendment process falls short, it can shine a spotlight of the super-PAC phenomenon and help apply pressure for change.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60n33k\">On sports teams:</a></h2> <p>I'm a [Chicago] Bulls guy.</p> <h2>Questions we wish he answered:</h2> <p>\u2022 President Obama, why didn't you close Guantanamo Bay as you promised you would?<br>\u2022 The ice in the arctic is the lowest ever recorded, and there are two more weeks of melting left in the summer.

  "<p>In 1850, the composer Charles Gounod offered the 9-year-old Pierre-Auguste Renoir a place in the choir of the church of Saint-Eustache in Paris. It's impossible to imagine how the history of art might have been different if Pierre-Auguste hadn't quit his musical training; but it's just as difficult to imagine the history of French Impressionist painting, literature or music without the fertilising influence of the other two arts.</p> <p>Matisse and Henri Duparc both drew inspiration from Baudelaire, while Ravel's idol Emmanuel Chabrier was one of Manet's earliest patrons. Degas, Mallarm\u00e9, Rodin and Renoir mixed with Paul Dukas and Henri Duparc at the soir\u00e9es that Ernest Chausson held at his elegant home on the Boulevard de Courcelles. Degas's many paintings of musicians and dancers at the Paris Opera, meanwhile, are the work of a painter who knew the world of music intimately.</p> <p>Renoir and Degas painted the operatic world of Gounod, Meyerbeer and Bizet. Music's response to Impressionism came a generation later, with Debussy, Ravel, and the composers featured in this concert. But all were part of a shared cultural impulse: one that embraced the exotic, the immediate and the sensuous; that prompted painters to create Nocturnes and Etudes, and composers to write Images and Miroirs. Ravel, Chausson, Dukas and Duparc would all, surely, have agreed with Renoir's artistic credo: a work of art must seize upon you, wrap you up in itself and carry you away.</p> <h2>Maurice Ravel (1875\u20131937): Rapsodie espagnole (15')<br></h2> <p><em>1 Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 la nuit <br>2 Malague\u00f1a <br>3 Habanera <br>4 Feria </em><br>Maurice Ravel was born in St Jean-de-Luz, on the Franco-Spanish border; his mother was Basque, and had met Ravel's father in Madrid. So Ravel considered himself half-Basque \u2013 and maybe that's the reason why his \"Spanish\" music feels closer to the real thing than any other French composer's. Take Manuel de Falla's word for it: \"[The Rapsodie] surprised me by its genuinely Spanish character \u2026 this 'Spanishness' is not achieved merely by drawing upon popular or folk songs but by using the rhythms, melodies and ornamental figures of our 'popular' music \u2013 none of which has altered in any way the natural style of the composer.\" </p> <p>It's true. If Rapsodie espagnole (1908) sounds unmistakably Spanish, it's equally unmistakably Ravel. That's not surprising \u2013 it grew out of a short Habanera for piano that Ravel had written in 1895, inspired by his mother's singing. No one in Spain bothered much with habaneras in the 1890s, but Mme Ravel, exiled to Paris, didn't know that; and for Ravel, this tiny piece symbolised his very personal relationship to Spanish music.</p> <p>The Habanera, delicately orchestrated, became the third movement of the Rapsodie. But first comes a haunting \"Prelude to the Night'\" - four notes stealing eerily through the perfumes and zephyrs of a Spanish summer night - and a short but feisty 'Malague\u00f1a' in which a strutting trumpet serenades over a pulsing dance-rhythm. And to finish, Ravel lets fly with a 'Feria' (Festival). Glinting flutes and harp set up the rhythm of a jota, strings scurry, the xylophone rattles, and Ravel explodes his whole, massive orchestra as the Rapsodie sweeps to a close in exuberant, gloriously splashy celebration.</p> <h2>Ernest Chausson (1855\u201399): Po\u00e8me pour violon, Op. 25 (16')</h2> <p><em>Simone Lamsma, violin </em></p> <blockquote> <p>\"Muzzio bade the Malay bring his Indian violin. It was like those of to-day, but instead of four strings it had only three, the upper part of it was covered with a bluish snake-skin, and the slender bow of reed was in the form of a half-moon, and on its extreme end glittered a pointed diamond.<br>\u2026 When Muzzio began the last song \u2026 it flowed out, exquisitely twisting and coiling like the snake that covered the violin-top; and such fire, such triumphant bliss glowed and burned in this melody that Fabio and Valeria felt wrung to the heart and tears came into their eyes \u2026\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Russian novelist Ivan Turgenev's story The Song of Triumphant Love is a tale of exotic wonders, of forbidden passion, and a strange love-song more powerful than murder. Turgenev frequented the same Parisian salons as the young composer Ernest Chausson; and while Chausson may not have known Turgenev personally, he certainly knew of the Russian's love-affair with the famous soprano Pauline Viardot, of the jealous emotions it aroused, and the strange, snake-headed African violin that hung in M. Viardot's study.</p> <p>But when in 1896, at the request of the great Belgian violinist Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe, Chausson wrote this ravishing Po\u00e8me inspired by The Song of Triumphant Love, he was under the spell of an even sweeter and more enchanting poison. 'The red spectre of Wagner', he confessed, 'will not let go of me \u2026 I leaf through his pages, trying to find hidden vices \u2013 and I find them.' Wagner seeps through every page of the Po\u00e8me; it's like a yearning, doomed love scene from one of his operas with \u2013 instead of a soprano \u2013 the gleaming song of Ysa\u00ffe's violin. Yet its subtle perfumes, sultry climaxes and lush, surging climaxes are all unmistakably Gallic \u2013 and they're all Chausson's own. It's hard to be objective about such exquisitely crafted decadence.</p> <h2>Maurice Ravel (1875\u20131937): Une barque sur l'oc\u00e9an (7')</h2> <p>In the small harbour opposite Ravel's birthplace in St-Jean-de-Luz, blue fishing boats bob at their orange buoys. Ravel was intensely alive to nuances of colour and light; even on the distinctly landlocked Lake Geneva, he couldn't help but note how 'the colours are intense and paradoxical with illusory shadings. And then the boats with their shining sails \u2026' His piano suite Miroirs (1905) was meant, as the name implies, to reflect distinct visual impressions.</p> <p>This explains why he took such immense care over his orchestration of the third 'Miroir', Une barque sur l'oc\u00e9an ('A boat on the ocean') \u2013 taking until 1926 to produce a version that satisfied him. The luxe, calme et volupt\u00e9 of a warm sea is unmistakable \u2013 though the sudden, blustery swell that menaces the central section will surprise no one familiar with the southern Bay of Biscay. Maurice Ravel liked to get things exactly right.</p> <p><strong>INTERVAL (20 minutes)<br></strong></p> <h2>Henri Duparc (1848\u20131933): M\u00e9lodies (17')</h2> <p><strong><em>Danielle de Niese, soprano </em></strong><br><em>1 L'invitation au voyage<br>2 Chanson triste <br>3 La vie ant\u00e9rieure <br>4 Phidyl\u00e9 <br></em></p> <p>\"Do not write much - but let it be very good.\" C\u00e9sar Franck's advice to his star pupil Henri Duparc could apply to any songwriter. When words already supply half the story, the composer's role is delicate - providing just enough extra colour and emotion to let the words blossom, but never overpowering them to the point where the poet might cry (like the writer Olivier in Richard Strauss's opera Capriccio) \"Horror! I'm being set to music!\" In Duparc's case, Franck's advice took on a tragic relevance. Paralysed by neurasthenia at the age of 37, Duparc never composed again, despite living to the age of 85. His life's work comprised just two exquisite orchestral works, and about a dozen of the most perfect songs in the French language. Duparc chose his poets with care; here, Baudelaire, Leconte de Lisle, and Jean Lahor. But there's nothing decadent about his settings. As befits a disciple of Wagner, each song - from the languorous idyll of Phidyl\u00e9, and the surging nostalgia of La vie ant\u00e9rieure to his masterpiece, the brooding, ecstatic L'invitation au voyage - is a tiny world of concentrated emotion.</p> <h2>Paul Dukas (1865\u20131935): La P\u00e9ri (17')</h2> <p>Paris has always loved scandals, and between 1908 and 1913 Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes served them up on an annual basis. Diaghilev hired the greatest artists of his day to produce his dazzling spectacles: Bakst, Benoit and Paul Poiret were part of his creative team, and later collaborators would include Picasso, Matisse and Coco Chanel. His aim was to astonish, and in the years before 1914, that meant exoticism: the heady, richly-coloured thrills of the savage, the sensuous and the oriental.</p> <p>Paul Dukas understood his brief when, in 1911, he wrote his score for the ballet La P\u00e9ri. According to Persian myth, a Peri is a fallen angel; a beautiful, mystical being equally capable of great good or great evil. In the ballet, Iskender (Alexander the Great) travels to an enchanted garden at the ends of the earth to steal immortality \u2013 in the form of a bejewelled lotus \u2013 from a ravishing Peri. At first, he succeeds: whereupon the Peri turns the full force of her seductive power upon him to win it back.</p> <p>Dukas rings up the curtain with a suitably barbaric fanfare, and then paints the garden in muted, glinting shades, before introducing Iskender (a poised fanfare) and the Peri (a languishing melody for cor anglais) and launching them on their long, gorgeous dance of love and death. He called his score a po\u00e8me dans\u00e9, and unless you're forming your own mental images, it's not really complete. L\u00e9on Bakst had already designed some sumptuous (and revealing) costumes for the ballet when, in May 1911, after a row with the prima ballerina Natalia Trouhanova, Diaghilev dropped the production. Undaunted, she staged her own rival Concerts de Danse N. Trouhanowa the following year, and finally danced the role of the Peri \u2013 in direct competition with Diaghilev.</p> <p>Paris relished the scandal; and only a few whispered the still juicier morsel that Trouhanova was rumoured to be Dukas's lover. Let the music have the last word on that \u2026</p> <h2>Maurice Ravel (1875\u20131937): La valse (13')</h2> <blockquote> <p>\"At the first, the scene is dimmed by a kind of swirling mist. Occasionally the clouds part, allowing glimpses of waltzing couples. The mists dissolve little by little, and the light grows brighter, revealing an immense ballroom filled with whirling dancers. The light of the chandeliers bursts forth on the fortissimo. (An Imperial court, about 1855.)\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That's what Ravel wrote on the first page of La valse. But it only takes us a few minutes into the work. What you saw on stage was supposed to do the rest, because La valse, (like La P\u00e9ri), was a 'choreographic poem': a ballet score, written in 1919\u201320 for (but never staged by) Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. Not that Ravel needed any encouragement to swing into waltz time. He made no secret of his love for the 'useless occupation of social dancing', and he'd sketched La valse as early as 1906 as \"a grand waltz, a kind of homage to the memory of the great Strauss, not Richard, the other one \u2013 Johann\".</p> <p>\"You know\" he added, \"how much I love those wonderful rhythms\". He even gave those first sketches a title: Wien (Vienna). But that was 1906. This was 1919 \u2013 and that whole glittering world of grand waltzes, imperial balls and harmless luxury had just been swept from history in the most violent way imaginable. Ravel never put it into words, but he didn't need to. La valse (as Wien became) begins gorgeously enough \u2013 sighing, gliding, swooning seductively into the arms of the rhythm. It's hard to put a finger on the moment when we realise that the tempo is increasing, that the distant crashes and snarls are growing louder \u2013 and that things are starting to spin terrifyingly out of control. By then, it's already too late. We can only cling on for dear life as Ravel's dream-waltz, and the Impressionist world it symbolises, plunges headlong into an altogether harsher century.</p>",
  "<p>The so-called \"personhood\" movement was dealt a significant blow on Wednesday, after it failed to get enough support for a ballot measure in Colorado. </p> <p>The measure, which would define a fertilised egg as a person under the state constitution, thus banning abortions in the state, fell short by 4,000 of the 86,105 signatures it needed to qualify for the ballot in November, according to Scott Gessler, Colorado's secretary of state.</p> <p>This year, Personhood USA, the group behind the country-wide push for laws which would give fertilised eggs the same rights as people, has tried and failed <a href=\"http://www.resolve.org/get-involved/personhood-bills-and-ballot-initiatives.html#CA\">in seven different states</a> to secure enough signatures to make it a ballot measure for voters or to make the deadline required.</p> <p>It has failed in Oregon, Ohio, Nevada, Montana, Florida and California. The measure has been voted against in every state where it has appeared on the ballot, including the conservative state of Mississippi, which is currently trying to close its remaining abortion clinic, in 2011.</p> <p>The amendment aims to ban abortion, but medical experts and pro-choice campaigners have argued that it will also restrict access to birth control and fertility treatment. Infertility groups have urged members to vote against personhood amendments and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has<a href=\"http://www.acog.org/About_ACOG/News_Room/News_Releases/2012/Personhood_Measures\"> condemned personhood laws or amendments</a> as a \"grave threat to women's health\" by introducing measures that would ban some forms of contraception and life-saving treatment for ectopic and molar pregnancies, and restrict IVF treatment.</p> <p>The latest failure in Colorado marks the third attempt by pro-lifers to get it on the ballot there. The measure has steadily lost momentum in the state since 2008. Similar proposals then and in 2010, which made the ballot, failed after Coloradans voted against it by three to one.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Personhood USA said the secretary of state's count was wrong and vowed to challenge it.</p> <p>Jennifer Mason, a spokeswoman for Personhood USA told the Guardian it would demand a recount and try again to place it on the ballot. She said: \"We believe we have enough to place it on the ballot. We believe a number of ballot signatures were thrown out by the secretary of state.\"</p> <p>She said that if there were notary errors, a whole petition of signatures could be discarded erroneously. Mason said she had hired an attorney and had 30 days to challenge the count.</p> <p>Despite repeated setbacks, Mason said that Personhood USA will continue its efforts to get the amendment on the ballot next year or the year after in Ohio, Florida and Oregon, depending on their election agendas.</p> <p>She accused Planned Parenthood or running a \"campaign of misinformation\" about the measure but said they were determined to persevere.</p> <p>Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains (PPRM) said that women all over Colorado were \"signing with relief\", describing the news as a victory for women's health.</p> <p>Cathy Alderman, the vice-president of public affairs at PPRM said: \"What this means in Colorado is a significant erosion of support for this measure. It goes too far, and people are afraid of the consequences which are detailed in the measure itself.\"</p> <p>\"The personhood movement believes it has a lot of momentum. But when people realise how restrictive this measure is they are always going to vote against it. It could allow politicians and government to make private health decisions for women and voters are not OK with that.\"</p> <p>\"If you go back to some of the comments made by proponents of this measure, they don't know if it will have an effect on birth control or IVF. That's far too risky for us to accept and we believe it will limit access to birth control and IVF and that is bad. If personhood respected the voters it would discontinue its efforts.\"</p> <p>Colorado has one of the lowest thresholds for the number of signatures needed to get a measure on the ballot, requiring 86,000 compared to 385,000 in Ohio.</p>",
  "<p>A 100% start to the Premier League season, new signings and now a contemptuous dismissal of lower-league opposition in the League Cup; David Moyes must feel he moved to a different club in the summer after all. But this is Everton \u2013 should he need the reality check \u2013 and their transformation continued as Kevin Mirallas marked his full debut with two goals in a rout of Leyton Orient.</p> <p>The competition provides Moyes with the easiest route to his first trophy as Everton manager, not that the Goodison Park club has ever found a way through before, and his selection reflected a determination to correct that unwanted statistic this season. Though Marouane Fellaini, Nikica Jelavic and others were rested, the Everton manager picked a strong side against League One opposition and the job was as good as completed with a quarter of the tie gone. Mirallas, soon to be joined at Everton by the 17-year-old Kilmarnock winger Matthew Kennedy, made a convincing start as Moyes' side made light work of the League One visitors. Mirallas was at the heart of all four first- half goals in a dream full debut following his \u00a35.3m arrival from Olympiacos, but was not the only new signing to impress. Steven Naismith, on his first start at Goodison since his controversial exit from Rangers, also toyed with a weak Orient defence and the eye for the angled pass into the area from both summer signings augurs well for Moyes.</p> <p>The pair combined expertly for the first goal of the Belgium international's Everton career on 16 minutes. Naismith had already sent Magaye Gueye through for a clear shot on goal, saved well by the former Everton apprentice Jamie Jones, when his perfectly-weighted pass released Mirallas on the right of the Orient area. The striker stroked a calm finish into the far corner.</p> <p>Six minutes later Mirallas attempted to back-heel a Leighton Baines delivery across the penalty area and proved it was his night by miscuing the ball straight to Leon Osman, who poked the ball beyond Jones in the absence of a genuine challenge. Mirallas grabbed his second of the night when he cut inside from the left and sent Gueye's pass through the legs of Nathan Clarke and in off the deflated Orient goalkeeper.</p> <p>Russell Slade's side were offering nothing in attack and little resistance in defence and it was no surprise when Victor Anichebe added a fourth before half-time. Again Mirallas was involved, setting up his fellow striker for a low 20-yard finish that flew under Jones far too easily. Orient finally discovered some resilience in the second period but the fifth came when Seamus Coleman, revelling in space from right-back, chipped across the penalty area for Gueye to volley home.</p>",
  "<p>Ars\u00e8ne Wenger will not sell Theo Walcott before the transfer deadline even if the winger has not agreed to fresh terms at Arsenal. Walcott's future has been under the spotlight as he has entered the final 12 months of his contract and negotiations have stalled over a new deal.</p> <p>The club had suggested to Walcott that if he did not agree to their proposal of a long-term contract worth \u00a375,000 a week, as he has not, they would move him on before Friday night's cut-off. Manchester City are most prominent among his admirers while Liverpool have also shown an interest. Chelsea wanted him at the start of the summer but they have since signed a clutch of attacking midfielders.</p> <p>Walcott's relationship with Arsenal has been close to breaking point, and he was so frustrated on Sunday when he was dropped from the starting line-up away to Stoke City that he came to see the end of his six-and-a-half-year career at the club. He feared that his non-selection represented a political statement from them.</p> <p>Wenger had a meeting with Walcott on Wednesday, with the chief executive Ivan Gazidis present, at which he attempted to repair the recent damage. The manager told Walcott he wanted the contractual talks to resume and the closure of the summer transfer window would not represent a definitive deadline for them.</p> <p>Wenger and Gazidis are taking a risk in allowing Walcott to enter September without an agreement in place but they have come to reason that it is a calculated one as they know that the player wants to stay.</p> <p>Walcott's case is different to those of Samir Nasri and Robin van Persie, who left Arsenal with less than 12 months to run on their contracts. Nasri, who moved to City last August, and Van Persie, who joined Manchester United two weeks ago, wanted to leave the club and forced their departures after making it clear they would not consider extensions to their deals.</p> <p>Walcott has said in public he wants to stay and reiterated it to Wenger during the meeting on Wednesday . Wenger's knowledge of Walcott's intentions has allowed him to sound bullish when questioned about the 23-year-old's future while he might also have been reassured by his professionalism and commitment. Walcott reported for pre-season training on 19 July and he travelled, two days later, on the club's tour of the Far East, when other Euro 2012 players were stood down.</p> <p>\"We want to extend Theo's contract and to keep him at the club but you need not only our desire; his desire is also right,\" Wenger said, last Friday. \"He wants to stay and we need to find an agreement. We have so many players in midfield and on the flanks but Theo is a very important player for me. I hope he will stay and that's it.\"</p> <p>The sticking point has been the money, even if Walcott is not a money-motivated person. To him, it has become a question of self-worth and being paid his market value which, he feels, is \u00a3100,000 a week. He might look at the \u00a355,000 a week that Arsenal have paid to the reserve striker Nicklas Bendtner and reason that the offer of \u00a375,000 a week which is on the table is not sufficient.</p> <p>Walcott can look around and see his England colleague James Milner, for example, being paid \u00a390,000 a week at City. He knows City and Liverpool would give him \u00a3100,000 a week; City would pay much more. Walcott is the poster-boy for Arsenal's ventures in the Far East and while the club are happy to profit from his image, it feels a little incongruous that they do not appear to have factored his commercial worth into their wage offer.</p> <p>One of the surprising things about the situation and the way that it threatened to turn ugly has been the speed at which Arsenal conducted the negotiations. The club's transfer fixer Dick Law only opened the talks at the beginning of the month and he has had discussions on two further occasions, most recently last Friday.</p> <p>The negotiations are set to continue, after the alarm of the past days, and the longer the new contract remains unsigned, the more the power would appear to rest with Walcott. The on-going issue is likely to dominate Wenger's briefingon Thursday, ahead of Sunday's Premier League match at Liverpool.</p>",
  "<p>\"Justice is truth in action.\" These words spoken in 1851 by Benjamin Disraeli encapsulate the ultimate objective. The moment justice is partisan, truth becomes a victim, and a core element of any democratic society is fatally undermined. Miscarriages of justice provide prime examples of how easily individual errors and misdemeanours translate into systemic abuse unless there is constant awareness and scrutiny. Such vulnerabilities have to be identified and circumscribed by a regularly reviewed and effective process of checks and balances.</p> <p>It is tempting to believe that the infamous miscarriages of the 80s are a thing of the past, and that the incorporation of various legislative instruments and organisations have eliminated the risk of repetition. Unfortunately it never works like this and each generation has to relearn the lessons of the past and build on the earlier remedies. While wrongful convictions based on confession evidence are now rare to nonexistent, the focus of evidential attention has become forensic science. The problem in both instances is the same: the growth of a culture in which there is an arrogance of unquestioned presumption and assumption.</p> <p>The UK is one of the few major nations not to have a national forensic science institute and, in the wake of government market-based policy, no longer has a national forensic science service. The main repercussion of these deficiencies is fragmentation and creeping deregulation. Unless standards are unified, certified and monitored, unprofessional practices arise as do unprofessional practitioners.A recent series of events exemplify the urgent need for re-appraisal. This month Dr Freddy Patel, a pathologist who had provided the initial opinion following the death of Ian Tomlinson in the 2009 G20 protest,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/23/tomlinson-pathologist-freddy-patel-struck-off?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\"> was stuck off </a>by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service. The panel found that he had an arrogant mindset that generated an unwarranted confidence in his own ability. He had committed 68 errors in his examination and had wrongly attributed Tomlinson's death to cardiac arrest. The panel also found that he had lied about his status in order to remain on a Home Office register.</p> <p>If this were an exceptional aberration by a novice that slipped through the net it would be serious enough, but the malaise runs much deeper. Patel had been qualified for 35 years. Significant concerns about him had been voiced before 2009. These had seen him removed from the Metropolitan police panel of pathologists offered contracts in 2004. The following year other complaints were presented to the GMC. After 2006 it was a prerequisite to qualify for the Home Office register that the practitioner be part of a group practice of pathologists. Patel concealed the fact that he was not part of a group from the National Policing Improvement Agency.</p> <p>Somewhere along the line someone is not applying strict scrutiny. A pathologist told BBC News on 23 August that it was well known among some of the profession that Patel had been routinely giving the cause of death as natural causes when this cannot have been the case. Other cases dating back to 2002 have surfaced which saw three- and four-month suspensions for Patel in 2010 and 2011, one of which concerned dishonestly omitting key findings in relation to a murder victim. I trust there will be a thorough review of all cases he has handled over the last decade.</p> <p>The coroner has explained his appointment of Patel in the first place on the basis that the only requirement under the coronial regime was that the person was a registered medical practitioner. These systemic deficiencies are unacceptable and jeopardise the search for truth. For Tomlinson's family it meant a prolonged and painful struggle to undo the damage done. There was delay while other pathologists were engaged who ultimately came to a different and unanimous conclusion that the death resulted from injury to the liver which caused internal bleeding and finally cardiac arrest.</p> <p>But with conflicting medical opinion, the director of public prosecutions was unwilling to mount a prosecution against the police officer concerned. An inquest followed and the jury declared that Tomlinson had been unlawfully killed. More delay ensued while the decision to prosecute was reconsidered and a prosecution for manslaughter instigated. This cannot have been straightforward in the light of Patel's original opinion, one which he was unwilling to change.</p> <p>Alongside this unfolding saga is an equally unpalatable tale of systemic fault within the police. Initially a statement of denial and non-involvement was issued. The City of London police also withheld details of Tomlinson's injuries from his family. When the police account was contradicted by the pictures recorded by a tourist, it was claimed Tomlinson was pushed out of the way for his own safety and later rumours were peddled that some protesters dressed up as police might be responsible.</p> <p>The trial this year of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/19/simon-harwood-not-guilty-ian-tomlinson\" title=\"\">PC Simon Harwood</a> was successfully defended on the basis that he had only used reasonable force when he struck Tomlinson on the leg and pushed him to the ground. What the jury was unaware of was the background of this officer. In 2001 he had quit the Met on health grounds just prior to a disciplinary hearing. He subsequently rejoined the Surrey police and re-entered the Met in 2005. There were a series of allegations being investigated involving suspects being threatened, throttled, punched, and kneed, one of which was upheld.</p> <p>By the time of the G20 protest Harwood was a member of the so-called elite <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Support_Group\" title=\"\">TSG squad</a>. The Independent Police Complaints Commission regarded this re-employment as \"simply staggering\". They recommended an internal investigation in public which is to be held on 17 September. They also revealed that the statements of three police witnesses who had seen an assault on Tomlinson with a baton had not originally been disclosed by police to the IPCC investigators charged with the duty of looking into allegations of deaths occurring at the hands of the police. On the same day as Tomlinson's death, Harwood had already had altercations with protestors and bystanders as well as pushing a BBC cameraman to the ground.</p> <p>It could be regarded as the understatement of the century to wonder where quality control of evidential sources has gone. This has immediate ramifications for the overall integrity of our system of justice and should ring alarm bells in all quarters. The whole sullied picture is exacerbated by the iniquitous cuts in public funding which have already hit forensic science resources but are also impacting upon the quality and numbers of personnel who are willing to engage in the system at all levels.</p> <p>If market forces are to be the determinative factor in the quest for truth then, just like most economies, we will be heading for irretrievable meltdown. Justice is not a business enterprise, still less a commodity. It is \"truth in action\".</p>",

But to go on the road you need a driving licence, and it's an offence not to give your true name and address. The internet needs to grow up \u2013 it cannot remain like the forest in the 13th century at the time of Robin Hood, totally outside the law. Myerson's argument is timely and helpful.<br><strong>Helen Goodman MP</strong><br><em>Shadow minister for media</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Jonathan Myerson has a point about online anonymity facilitating abusive comments. I always use my own name when tweeting or posting online. Either you can defend what you have to say or you should keep quiet. But there are exceptions. First, for a range of reasons \u2013 employers being one \u2013 not everyone does feel as free as they might wish to say what they want. This goes beyond whistleblowing to the expression of political views. As important is the role of the pseudonym or pen name. Here the writer's name can be discovered, but not easily, and the cloak of relative anonymity allows them to say publicly what they might otherwise not. The Secret Footballer comes to mind.<br><strong>Keith Flett</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Jonathan Myerson doesn't mention the unhelpful and potentially pernicious exercise in collecting and displaying customers' anonymous comments on services such as restaurants.</p> <p>Looking recently at just such a case I found an instance with three almost slanderous comments interspersed with several glowing testimonies, one of which said \"it was so good we went again the next night\". It is difficult, if not impossible, to glean anything from such diametrically opposite views, and the aggregate score added little light. More importantly, the owner of the restaurant has little or no opportunity to rebut potentially damaging comments, and may even wonder whether his competitors are posting false messages of dissatisfaction.<br><strong>Alan Gilchrist</strong><br><em>Brighton</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008It is all very well for Jonathan Myerson to decry online anonymity in the Guardian \u2013 he will not suffer the consequences of his writing the article. There are many parts of the world (including the US) where being a member of the LGBT community can result in persecution or death. There are parts of the world where being an atheist can have fatal consequences; in the US atheists can lose their jobs.</p> <p>Is Myerson saying these people should keep quiet, or perhaps he does not think the consequences of speaking out matter? Pseudonymity (not anonymity) on the internet has given many oppressed people the ability to speak out without fear of reprisal \u2013 should this be abandoned to assuage Myerson's tender feelings?<br><strong>Andrew Deacon</strong><br><em>Leicester</em></p>",
  "<p>It's curious that the only letters you printed in response to George Monbiot's alarm call on environmental threats proffered population control as the solution (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/28/too-many-people-overcrowded-planet\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 29 August).

  "<p>Nick Clegg returned from his family holiday on a Spanish beach at the weekend determined to capture the agenda in the runup to his party conference. His proposal for a wealth tax, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/28/nick-clegg-thorny-path-out-of-rose-garden\" title=\"\">made in our interview</a> on Wednesday as the political world began to regroup at Westminster, was a bit like tossing a stone at a mob of seagulls: a lot of noise, but not much result. Yet as the skirl of feathers and cries dies down, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/wintour-and-watt/2012/aug/29/nickclegg-liberaldemocrats\" title=\"\">the proposal is still lying there</a>. The deputy prime minister's big idea for the second half of the coalition is a tax on the richest members of society as a necessary corollary of the two more years of austerity that the chancellor, George Osborne, is now demanding, and he has set it in the context of social cohesion. There are plenty of reasons to be sceptical about his motives, but he is right that the principle that the wealthiest should pay more tax in order to achieve a more equal society matters, and will matter more and more the longer it takes for the economy to return to growth.</p> <p>The Lib Dems, however, have a lot of form on proposing wealth taxes, and rather less on delivering them. Vince Cable's aspiration for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/sep/21/cable-1m-home-tax-lib-dems\" title=\"\">a mansion tax</a>, which remains a party commitment, was an earlier indication of the overall strategy of shifting tax from income to assets. It was justification for acquiescing in the last budget to a cut in the higher rate of tax from 50p to 45p, which, as Labour argued on Wednesday, is no way to share the burden of deficit reduction. The biggest tax reform the party can claim from its role in coalition is raising the threshold for income tax to \u00a310,000 by 2015.</p> <p>The party believes it has now established itself with the voters as the party that embedded an idea of tax fairness in the coalition programme \u2013 so much so that its slogan for next month's conference is \"fairer taxes in tough times\". <a href=\"http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/6045\" title=\"\">The evidence is less positive</a>. Raising tax thresholds delivers not for the poorest, a third of whom pay no tax anyway, but for middle-income earners in two-income households. In the last budget, another attempt at a kind of wealth tax, trailed at first as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/11/nick-clegg-vince-cable-split-on-tycoon-tax\" title=\"\">\"tycoon tax\"</a>, led to removing tax relief on large charitable donations. The initiative, attributed to the Lib Dem Treasury chief secretary, Danny Alexander, was abandoned amid a storm of protest from charities and big donors.</p> <p>So taxing wealth is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/aug/29/clegg-emergency-wealth-tax\" title=\"\">a lot easier to talk about than to deliver</a>. The simplest and most effective policy would be a revaluation of the property values used to calculate council tax (unchanged since 1991), accompanied by the introduction of a couple of higher bands at the&#xa0;top. Such a policy would also fit the Lib Dems' localist sensibilities. But <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19408390\" title=\"\">reports suggest</a> that David Cameron vetoed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/mar/06/georgeosborne-vincentcable\" title=\"\">any such idea at the time of the last budget</a>, and Conservatives are too scorched by the poll tax to have any appetite to reopen the subject. After all, every tax reform creates losers who complain and winners who stay silent (and many of the losers of any updated council tax would be voters in Lib Dem marginal seats such as Vince Cable's).&#xa0;Mr Clegg, it is clear, wants a different&#xa0;kind of wealth tax.</p> <p>At Westminster, Lib Dems remain loyal to their leader and committed to coalition. When he meets the party activists in Brighton in three weeks, he faces a much tougher audience. Already it is a struggle in some northern cities to find local election candidates. A <a href=\"http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/death-by-coalition/\" title=\"\">YouGov poll in Prospect</a> magazine put their support at 10%, down from 24% at the election, and the most cheering news from the polls is that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/aug/28/poll-voters-say-george-osborne-lose-job-reshuffle\" title=\"\">the chancellor is now marginally more unpopular</a> than Mr Clegg. Clearly there is a way to travel to raise spirits. But floating ideas he cannot be confident of delivering is a high-risk strategy, particularly when the failures of coalition \u2013 constitutional reforms, tuition fees \u2013 so far outweigh the successes.</p> <p>When three-quarters of former Lib Dem supporters say they no longer know what the party stands for, and there is a significant minority of loyalists who agree, Mr Clegg cannot afford to add to the impression of powerlessness by floating another policy idea that fails to come off.</p>",
  "<p>I work for a media organisation but I must fess up: the media is as good at 'speaking truth to power' as it is at inventing 'truths', exploiting our collective fear and perpetuating stereotypes. Guilty as charged.</p> <p>For those reasons of course \u2013 and others such as working on controversial research and a <a href=\"http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2008_09_12/caredit.a0800134\" title=\"\">concern over a loss of credibility among peers</a> \u2013 academics can be reticent about talking to the media. But as Fiona Fox, director of the Science Media Centre, writes in a <a href=\"http://interactive.bis.gov.uk/scienceandsociety/site/media/files/2010/01/Science-and-the-Media-Securing-the-Future.pdf\" title=\"\">report about science and the media</a>, \"rightly or wrongly, some of the most important science debates of our times have been conducted on the front pages and in the headlines of the mainstream news \u2026 we ignore the mass media at our peril.\"</p> <p>On the surface, all higher education institutions have heeded those words. No university is without a press office, few do not have academics trained up as media experts, some are even proactive about informing the media about the availability of these experts to comment on issues as they arise. Still higher education and the media do not always make comfortable bedfellows.</p> <p>Melonie Fullick, a doctoral researcher at York University in Canada, has written a fair bit about the HE-media relationship. In one <a href=\"http://speculative-diction.blogspot.co.uk/2011/06/universities-media-part-2-why-media.html\" title=\"\">blogpost</a>, she lists 10 recurrent themes covered by the media, which she describes as \"often ill-informed\". She adds: \"While there are serious problems with some of the changes happening in universities, the debates that happen in the media don't necessarily contribute to public debate in a productive way.\"</p> <p>It would seem from bad science to bad policy, academia can \u2013 and is often \u2013 misrepresented. But as both Fullick and Fox say, the solution is not in returning to the 'knowledge castle' and pulling up the drawbridge. Universities and the researchers who work in them must engage with the media, and must do so ... well, engagingly.</p> <p>So on Friday 31 August at 12 BST, we'll discuss how to build trust in university-media relationships, how to avoid an institution, individual or piece of research being misrepresented or misquoted and best practice in traditional and social media training for researchers and academics.</p> <p><em>The discussion will take place in the comment threads beneath this blog.

  "<p>A former US marine who was taken from his home and involuntarily detained for psychiatric evaluation for posting controversial song lyrics and conspiracy theories on Facebook is to file a civil lawsuit against the FBI and police.</p> <p>Speaking for the first time since his release, after a judge ruled there was insufficient evidence to detain him, Brandon Raub said his experience was frightening and that it sent a \"extremely alarming\" message to Americans.</p> <p>His case has sparked vigorous online debate over First Amendment rights versus concerns over security. On Wednesday, a group called Revolution PAC, in support of former presidential candidate Ron Paul, called on Virginia governor Bob McDonnell and attorney General Ken Cuccinelli to apologise to Raub and to make public all communications related to the incident.</p> <p>Raub, 26, a former combat engineer who has served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was taken forcibly from his home in Chesterfield County, Virginia, by two FBI agents and police on 16 August. He was not charged with any crime. After talking with FBI agents, he was handcuffed and detained in a psychiatric hospital for seven days before a judge ruled on 23 August that there was not sufficient evidence to keep him there.</p> <p>In an interview posted on a <a href=\"http://wtvr.com/2012/08/21/mother-of-detained-marine-vet-says-hes-a-patriot-not-a-threat/\">conservative civil liberties website</a>, Raub said: \"I'm really tough so I roll with the punches. But it made me scared for my country. The idea that a man can be snatched off his property without being read his rights I think should be extremely alarming to all Americans.\"</p> <p>One posting said to be of concern was Raub's Facebook post on 13 August, which said: \"Sharpen up my axe: I'm here to sever heads\", a quote from a song called Bring Me Down by Swollen Members, a Canadian hip-hop band. Other posts focus on conspiracy theories related to 9/11 and talk of an upcoming revolution.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6KW6_gcQCpg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6KW6_gcQCpg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>A <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KW6_gcQCpg\">YouTube video of his arrest</a> in which he was dressed only in shorts and looked frightened went viral, and support for Raub has grown online. One of several Facebook groups set up by supporters, \"Support Brandon Raub Group\" has 11,204 members and a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/petitions/the-president-of-the-united-states-free-brandon-raub\">change.org petition</a> has been signed by thousands, including marines who served with him.</p> <p>In his interview with John Whitehead, constitutional attorney and president of the Charlottesville-based Rutherford Institute, which represented Raub in court and helped secure his release, Raub said the lyrics were meant as a metaphor for the power of truth.</p> <p>\"What I meant was \u2026 the truth is very powerful and has the ability to cut,\" Raub said. \"The truth is not always nice. Sometimes it can be very specific.\" Other Facebook postings, alleged to have been \"terrorist in nature\", were part of a private game he was playing online with his brother and sister, he said.</p> <p>Raub said that the FBI agents were \"very vague\" about what they wanted to talk to him about. He said he was not read his rights as required by law and was not charged with any crime.</p> <p>He said that Americans needed to educate themselves about government intrusions into the lives of citizens, and he urged people to do so, especially regarding the government's ability to seize private property and industry.</p> <p>Raub's mother, Cathleen Thomas, told reporters that her son has no history of mental illness or violence, but was a patriot in a family of patriots. He is \"concerned about all the wars we've experienced\" and believes the US government was complicit in the September 11 terrorist attacks. One of his Facebook posts, she said, pictured the gaping hole in the Pentagon and asked \"where's the plane?\"</p> <p>\"I want the country to know who he is \u2013 that he's not crazy, he's a staunch patriot,\" <a href=\"http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2012/08/ap-marine-veteran-brandon-raub-detained-facebook-posts-082012/\">Thomas told AP</a>. She said she has posted similar things herself, <a href=\"http://wtvr.com/2012/08/21/mother-of-detained-marine-vet-says-hes-a-patriot-not-a-threat/\">questioning the government</a> and its role in the 9/11 attacks.</p> <p>Virginia law allows police to detain people for mental evaluation under emergency circumstances. Four days after Raub was taken into custody, he was ordered by a special justice to be involuntarily committed at the veterans affairs medical centre in Salem, around 200 miles form his home, after the special justice concluded he was mentally ill and presented a danger to others. </p> <p>But on 23 August, a Prince George County circuit judge ruled that involuntary commitment order was flawed and and ordered Raub's release. \"The petition is so devoid of any factual allegations that it could not be reasonably expected to give rise to a case or controversy,\" the order from W Allan Sharrett said.</p> <p>Whitehead told the Guardian he would file a federal civil suit against the FBI and local authorities for violation of Raub's First Amendment rights. He plans to challenge what he said is the misuse of Virginia's civil commitment laws, which determine a person can be involuntarily committed upon evidence that he or she has a mental illness and they may cause harm to themselves or others.</p> <p>\"They over-reacted,\" Whitehead said. \"There was no specific threats here. They knew that \u2013 they didn't search the property. If the police had done their homework, they would know this guy doesn't even own a weapon.\"</p> <p>Whitehead said some of the postings were made by Raub's brother and that the surveillance of a private Facebook group without a search warrant was also illegal. He dismissed Raub's psychiatric evaluation, during which mental health professionals said they found signs of psychosis. \"Or course they did \u2013 he's a 9/11 truther,\" said Whitehead.</p> <p>\"Psychiatrists think that's crazy, but do you know how many people believe that in the US? About a million. You have a right to say what you believe. There were no specific threats to anyone.\"</p> <p>Whitehead said he had been \"besieged\" by legal requests from veterans alleging similar treatment at the hands of the authorities since taking on the case.</p> <p>An FBI spokesman said it took action against Raub after receiving public complaints over his posts. \"He was never arrested, he was taken into custody by the local authorities for a mental evaluation,\" he said. \"He was never charged with any criminal action. Many times we get complaints from the public about individuals that may post a a violent threat. What we are doing is trying to determine if that individual poses a threat or not.\"</p> <p>He said he understood the Facebook postings of concern were \"limited\" but said he had no details of them.</p> <p>In a statement released after Raub's arrest, Chesterfield police said they had assisted federal agents in their attempts to interview him and that, after the interview, officers believed he needed further evaluation. He was handcuffed after resisting officers' attempts to place him custody, it said.</p>",
  "<p>When power starts to shift in the Middle East, its people have long known what to expect. Challenges to authority have rarely been met with a&#xa0;promise of consensus or inclusion. Strong-arm suppression \u2013 the more forceful the better \u2013 has been the default reaction to dissent. The price&#xa0;has usually been brutal.</p> <p>Syrians who wanted an end to regime dominance knew the rules when they started demanding changes in the region's most uncompromising police state in March last year. Now, 18&#xa0;months and more than 23,000 bodies later, and&#xa0;with no end in sight to the chaos ravaging the country, their&#xa0;worst fears are being realised on a&#xa0;scale that continues both to horrify and numb.</p> <p>And yet, the events of the past 18&#xa0;months have shattered one of the abiding guidelines to life under totalitarian rule \u2013 that absolute power is uncontestable. If anything has so far been achieved through the bedlam now rumbling through Syria and indeed other parts of the Arab world, it is a new reality: the power of the street has exposed the fragility of authority.</p> <p>\"I had always said they would fall over when we were no longer scared of them,\" Moustafa Abu Khalil, a retired electricity worker from the northern Syrian town of Jisr al-Shughour, told me in June. \"It took a long time to get to the point where people were prepared to risk everything, their families, their futures, just to bring about change. \"The truth be told, [the people] probably wouldn't have got here if the regime did not continue to escalate the violence every month. That just fed the flames. And now we have a true revolution, civil war, call it what you will. It is a point of no return.\"</p> <p>With all of Syria's cities now under siege, its capital Damascus and commercial hub Aleppo engulfed in violence, Syria seems well past that proverbial point. Defections have whittled down the strength and numbers of the country's vaunted military and destruction and misery is&#xa0;seriously testing the resolve of both&#xa0;regime supporters and those who&#xa0;want Bashar al-Assad gone.</p> <p>The country's economy has been under the anaconda-like grip of international sanctions, which have ground industry to a halt, crippled trade supply lines, battered the currency and shattered confidence. In the hard-hit north, little works any more. War has seen Syrian society, already stuck \u2013 seemingly permanently in 1973&#xa0;\u2013 wound back even further. There are more donkey carts than cars on the streets of some towns between Aleppo and the Turkish border. Clapped-out tractors belch fumes from precious fuel&#xa0;that is sold in&#xa0;two-litre bottles on&#xa0;rubbish-strewn roadsides for around $8 (\u00a35).</p> <p>\"None of us can afford it,\" says Abu Nour, a member of the Free Syrian Army, who, before the Syrian uprising gained momentum, was a tailor whose only military experience was 15 months as a&#xa0;conscript more than a decade ago. \"I'm not sure where the money is coming from to get us to the frontline. Those things a person like me doesn't ask.\"</p> <p>Abu Nour is now a foot soldier in the&#xa0;rebel army that is at the vanguard of the fight for Syria's destiny. Drawn largely from the rural poor, and also represented by conservative Islamic groupings such as the Muslim Brotherhood, the FSA has taken the battle to the country's two lead cities, where it is now engaged in a fight to the death with the regime army.</p> <p>Rebel groups entered Aleppo and Damascus in mid-July and their early gains sparked predictions that four decades of uncompromising rule was about to end. But as a withering summer draws to a close across the northern plains that have harboured Aleppo, and the central plateau on which Damascus, the world's oldest capital has stood for more than 6,000 years, this early optimism has yielded to a more unpalatable reality \u2013 that neither side is&#xa0;about to secure a decisive victory in either city anytime soon.</p> <p>The soaring death toll this week in&#xa0;Damascus, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/28/syria-worst-massacre-daraya-death-toll-400?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=feed\" title=\"\">where more than 300 people were reportedly killed in one day alone</a>, and the grinding misery in the battlefield suburbs of Aleppo, have left many in Syria \u2013 and in the rest of the ever-more restive region \u2013 wondering what comes next.</p> <p>\"Change of this scale is perilous,\" says Rita Sabbagh, a Damascus businesswoman who supports the regime. \"You must understand that meaningful shifts in thinking and behaviour take generations in this part of the world. Did they really think they would just ride into town like this and the regime would run away?\"</p> <p>Were he to try to cut a deal with Syria's fractious opposition groups or to capitulate to their demands, the downside for Assad and the regime he inherited from his father is obvious. Also increasingly clear, even to lay observers, is the scale of the risk to Syria's neighbours if the civil war continues to expose regional fault lines&#xa0;that have remained unaddressed throughout the modern history of the&#xa0;region.</p> <p>After the 500-year Ottoman empire disintegrated more than 90 years ago, the borders of Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan and what was to become Israel were defined \u2013 often on imperial whim. The pact between Britain and France that led to Syria's independence, known as the Sykes-Picot agreement, cobbled together various sects under the banner of nation states, which have not coexisted easily.</p> <p>For more than 40 years, the Alawite sect, which is loosely aligned to Shia Islam and had long been persecuted under the Ottomans, has been used to solidify regime control. Most of the key regime figures, including the Assads, have been Alawites ever since Bashar's father, Hafez al-Assad, was at the peak of his powers. Despite comprising around 12% of Syria's population, the Alawites dominate the Syrian establishment and hold most key positions in the military and security apparatus. Now, as&#xa0;Syria wobbles, the sect feels a deep sense of threat from the country's majority Sunnis, some of whom hold grudges against the regime because of&#xa0;its treatment towards them before the uprising.</p> <p>\"Egypt and Libya have taught us that the way that power works [now] in Syria does not have to be the way it will always be,\" said Mohammed Hariri at one of Aleppo's frontline zones earlier this month. A realignment of power appears to be top of the wish list for many fighters and residents alike in Syria's opposition strongholds. But such a shift will not be contained within Syria's borders \u2013 a fact that is causing increasing alarm outside the country and fuelling fears&#xa0;that changes more profound than&#xa0;anything since the fall of the Ottomans are starting to take place in&#xa0;the Middle East.</p> <p>In neighbouring Lebanon, long under the tutelage of Syria to the east and the influence of other players, such as Saudi Arabia, the United States, France and Israel, the tension is palpable. \"I'm afraid that if things are to stay like that, it could lead to the partitioning of Syria and where that will lead the Middle East, don't ask me,\" the leader of Lebanon's Druze sect, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walid_Jumblatt\" title=\"\">Walid Jumblatt</a>, told the Guardian earlier this month. \"Big historical cities will be destroyed. Assad might take refuge in the mountains. Now he is trying to cleanse the Sunnis from Latakia, Benyas, Tartous. It seems the map of Syria is being changed. What is left of the famous Sykes-Picot agreement is being changed.\"</p> <p>Along with Jumblatt, other Lebanese leaders broadly aligned to the west or Saudi Arabia have been lying low this summer. The country's former prime minister, Saad Hariri \u2013 whose father, the Lebanese elder statesman Rafiq Hariri, was assassinated in 2005 \u2013 has been in self-imposed exile in Riyadh and Paris for the past 18 months.</p> <p>Samir Geagea, a political ally of the Hariri, who leads a prominent Christian political bloc, <a href=\"http://www.free-lebanon.net/syria/lf-leader-samir-geagea-escapes-assassination-attempt/\" title=\"\">survived a failed attempt by a sniper to shoot him</a> in his garden in June. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/14/assad-lebanon-damascus-syria\" title=\"\">The arrest earlier this month of Lebanon's former information minister, Michel Samaha</a>, a key ally of Bashar al-Assad, has given weight to the fears that assassins are lurking.</p> <p>Samaha has been charged with receiving explosives and instructions from Syria's national security chief, General Ali Mamlouk, allegedly with the knowledge of Assad, to target 20 key figures in Lebanon. He was entrapped by a close aide who filmed him saying Assad was personally aware&#xa0;of the plans. His case is now before a military tribunal, a rare event in Lebanon, where state institutions have often failed to assert their independence.</p> <p>In Iraq, where assassins have remained a part of the political fabric for much of the past eight years, there is also a growing fear that the chaos in Syria cannot be contained. Islamist groups that wreaked havoc between 2004 and 2007 have announced that they are trying to reclaim ground they lost during fighting with US forces and&#xa0;militias that were at the time backed by the US and Iraqi governments. They claim to be drawing inspiration from the Syrian uprising, which has in part been joined by a new dynamic \u2013 jihadists from other parts of the Arab world, some of whom see the fighting taking place in Syria as part of a global jihad.</p> <p>\"They are trying to make their presence felt again,\" the director general of&#xa0;the intelligence division at Iraq's interior ministry, Major General Ali Hussein Kamal, explained earlier this month. \"They see what is happening in&#xa0;Syria as a chance for them.\"</p> <p>Sitting in his fortified office in a riverside Baghdad suburb, Kamal claimed that Syria's insistence that the&#xa0;uprising against it is a foreign-led plot using jihadists was at odds with Iraq's recent dealings with Syria. \"In&#xa0;2009, the bombs that targeted the ministries could clearly be traced back to Syria,\" he said. \"Both in planning and instruction.\"</p> <p>Asked whether he believed that regime figures had known of the bombing campaign, in which huge bombs targeted the finance, foreign and justice ministries, as well as the Baghdad governor's offices, killing more than 200 people, Kamal said: \"I refer you to&#xa0;the comments of the defected Syrian&#xa0;ambassador to Iraq who said the&#xa0;regime had close links to al-Qaida and had links to the recent bombings in&#xa0;Damascus.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395465184\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/29/1346257793617/A-man-reacts-after-an-air-010.jpg\" alt=\"A man reacts after an airstrike on Azaz, 15 August 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man reacts after an airstrike on Azaz destroyed 10 buildings on 15 August 2012.

The Syrian army has warned of \"inevitable death\" for rebel fighters who don't put down their weapons in areas known as opposition strongholds. Anti-regime neighbourhoods say they have little reason to trust that pledges of amnesties will be honoured by a military that has shown no quarter in more than a year of&#xa0;battles with rebels. And, as sectarian positions harden, in an increasingly volatile region, there appears little reason for the regime to decide that now would be a time for compromise.</p> <p>Iran, which has viewed Syria as its key&#xa0;ally in the Arab world for much of the past 30 years, has shown signs of increasing belligerence as the situation in&#xa0;Syria has deteriorated. The fall of Damascus would be a serious strategic blow for Tehran, as it would for its key ally in Lebanon, Hezbollah, which has enjoyed staunch support and patronage from both regimes since 1982.</p> <p>Also unflinchingly in Syria's corner is&#xa0;Russia, which has acted to prevent even more severe international sanctions or any move towards direct foreign intervention in the conflict. Russia's ties&#xa0;to the Syrian regime date back to Soviet days and have, in many ways, post-dated them. Libya and Egypt had at&#xa0;times been in the Soviet sphere. Syria, meanwhile, has barely left it despite the&#xa0;end of the cold war more than 20&#xa0;years ago.</p> <p>Late last month, in a grand villa&#xa0;in the Aleppo hinterland that belongs to the family of General Hikmat Shehabi, a former confidante of Hafez al-Assad who left Syria shortly after his son was named president, rebels thumbed through old books on a lounge room shelf. One had been signed by the late North Korean dictator, Kim Jung-il. There were also tomes in tribute to Assad Sr and eulogies to the achievements of Soviet society. Time had stood still in the dusty marble mansion, just as&#xa0;it had on the drab empty streets outside where this society in the north&#xa0;of&#xa0;a country deeply embroiled in revolution seemed collectively unsure about what to do next.</p> <p>\"Nobody has come to help us,\" said&#xa0;Khalid Ibrahim, a steel worker who joined the rebel army when dwindling business closed his workshop earlier this&#xa0;year. A Russian-made Mig fighter jet circled nearby as Ibrahim pressed his point. \"We knew what we were up against when we took this on, but in Libya the Americans were there within a&#xa0;month. France and Britain were fighting each other to be the first to bomb Gaddafi. And Assad is worse, much, much worse.\" He shook his head, then added: \"This could be a disaster, or a new map. Only God knows which way it will go.\"</p> <p>In dozens of conversations the Guardian has had with Syrians in recent months \u2013 some diehard regime backers and others just as deeply committed to the opposition cause \u2013 a&#xa0;clear sense has emerged that the popular uprising that started it all in the southern city of Deraa has been dwarfed by something far more significant.</p> <p>The arc of revolution that started in&#xa0;Tunisia, surged through Egypt, then&#xa0;raged through Libya, has hit an obstacle in Syria, one that may prove difficult as a whole for the region to bypass. \"History has hijacked what the people were trying to achieve,\" says Amal Kuzbari, a Syrian teacher from Homs, now a refugee in southern Turkey. \"It&#xa0;was simple at the beginning and it&#xa0;isn't now.</p> <p>The fight for Syria has become a struggle for the destiny of the region. It&#xa0;is also now a clash of ideologies and orders, of sects and societies. The battle for regional influence runs straight through Damascus and none of&#xa0;the region's main players are willing to yield ground. \"It's Sunni versus Shia, Arab versus Persian, America versus Russia, the list goes on,\" says a western diplomat. \"This is unfinished business on many levels.\"</p> <p>What will emerge from Syria's civil war will likely take many months to determine. A rapid end to the regime would not mean an end to crisis. The vacuum that would follow the end of strongman rule would take some filling \u2013 the recent experience of Iraq to the east, another sectarian state bound together by an autocrat, clearly demonstrates that.</p> <p>Even states such as Turkey, with strong borders and robust institutions, will remain susceptible to Syria's spillover effects. Turkey is now hosting around 40,000 Syrian refugees and said earlier this year that it has prepared contingencies for up to 500,000. However, if Syria's Kurds decide that the crumbling of state authority gives them the chance to push their case for statehood, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/29/us-syria-crisis-refugees-turkey-idUSBRE87S08020120829\" title=\"\">Turkey will be facing more than a refugee crisis</a>.</p> <p>\"Changing how power works [in the&#xa0;region] is a good thing,\" explains a&#xa0;Syrian exile in Beirut, who claims to support neither side. \"But I'm not sure people know exactly what it is they have started.\"</p>",

  "<p><strong>(updated below)</strong></p> <p>The rightwing transparency group, Judicial Watch, released Tuesday <a href=\"http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-obtains-4-to-5-inch-stack-of-overlooked-cia-records-detailing-meetings-with-bin-laden-filmmakers/\">a new batch of documents</a> showing how eagerly the Obama administration shoveled information to Hollywood film-makers about the Bin Laden raid. Obama officials did so to enable the production of a politically beneficial pre-election film about that \"heroic\" killing, even as administration lawyers <a href=\"http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/04/federal-judge-denies-foia-request-for-bin-laden-photos.php\">insisted to federal courts</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2011/05/look-whos-foiaing-bin-laden-death-photo/37493/\">media outlets</a> that no disclosure was permissible because the raid was classified.</p> <p>Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/05/23/wh_leaks_for_propaganda_film/\">prior disclosures</a> from Judicial Watch of documents it obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, this is old news. That's what the Obama administration <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/06/07/probing_obamas_secrecy_games/\">chronically does</a>: it manipulates secrecy powers to prevent accountability in a court of law, while leaking at will about the same programs in order to glorify the president.</p> <p>But what is news in this disclosure are the <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/104180865/Advance-Maureen-Dowd-Piece#page=42\">newly released emails</a> between Mark Mazzetti, the New York Times's national security and intelligence reporter, and CIA spokeswoman Marie Harf. The CIA had evidently heard that Maureen Dowd was planning to write a column on the CIA's role in pumping the film-makers with information about the Bin Laden raid in order to boost Obama's re-election chances, and was apparently worried about how Dowd's column would reflect on them. On 5 August 2011 (a Friday night), Harf wrote an email to Mazzetti with the subject line: \"Any word??\", suggesting, obviously, that she and Mazzetti had already discussed Dowd's impending column and she was expecting an update from the NYT reporter.</p> <p>A mere two minutes after the CIA spokeswoman sent this Friday night inquiry, Mazzetti responded. He promised her that he was \"going to see a version before it gets filed\", and assured her that there was likely nothing to worry about:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"My sense is there a very brief mention at bottom of column about CIA ceremony, but that [screenwriter Mark] Boal also got high level access at Pentagon.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>She then replied with this instruction to Mazzetti: \"keep me posted\", adding that she \"really appreciate[d] it\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395385563\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346258522282/mazzetti.png\" alt=\"Mazzetti\" width=\"618\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Moments later, Mazzetti forwarded the draft of Dowd's unpublished column to the CIA spokeswoman (it was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/opinion/sunday/Dowd--The-Downgrade-Blues.html?_r=1\">published the following night online</a> by the Times, and two days later in the print edition). At the top of that email, Mazzetti wrote: \"this didn't come from me \u2026 and please delete after you read.\" He then proudly told her that his assurances turned out to be true:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"See, nothing to worry about.\"</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395385564\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346258599589/mazzetti2.png\" alt=\"Mazzetti2\" width=\"607\" height=\"230\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This exchange, by itself, is remarkably revealing: of the standard role played by establishment journalists and the corruption that pervades it. Here we have a New York Times reporter who covers the CIA colluding with its spokesperson to plan for the fallout from the reporting by his own newspaper (\"nothing to worry about\"). Beyond this, that a New York Times journalist \u2013 ostensibly devoted to bringing transparency to government institutions \u2013 is pleading with the CIA spokesperson, of all people, to conceal his actions and to delete the evidence of collusion is so richly symbolic.</p> <p>The relationship between the New York Times and the US government is, as usual, anything but adversarial. Indeed, these emails read like the interactions between a PR representative and his client as they plan in anticipation of a possible crisis.</p> <p>Even more amazing is the reaction of the newspaper's managing editor, Dean Baquet, to these revelations, as <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/08/nyt-reporter-gave-advance-copy-of-maureen-dowd-column-133479.html\">reported by Politico's Dylan Byers</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"New York Times Managing Editor Dean Baquet called POLITICO to explain the situation, but provided little clarity, saying he could not go into detail on the issue because it was an intelligence matter. </p> <p>\"'I know the circumstances, and if you knew everything that's going on, you'd know it's much ado about nothing,' Baquet said. 'I can't go into in detail. But I'm confident after talking to Mark that it's much ado about nothing.' </p> <p>\"'The optics aren't what they look like,' he went on. 'I've talked to Mark, I know the circumstance, and given what I know, it's much ado about nothing.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/29/mark-mazzetti-maureen-dowd-cia-new-york-times\">There is so much to say</a> about that passage. </p> <p><em>First</em>, try though I did, I'm unable to avoid noting that this statement from Baquet \u2013 \"the optics aren't what they look like\" \u2013 is one of the most hilariously incoherent utterances seen in some time. It's the type of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/oliver-burkemans-blog/2012/aug/28/why-2012-campaign-optics-dont-look-good\">meaningless, illiterate corporatese</a> that comes spewing forth from bumbling executives defending the indefensible. I've read that sentence roughly a dozen times over the last 24 hours and each time, it provides me with greater amounts of dark amusement.</p> <p><em>Second</em>, look at how the New York Times mimics the CIA even in terms of how the newspaper's employees speak: Baquet \"provided little clarity, saying he could not go into detail on the issue <em>because it was an intelligence matter</em>\". In what conceivable way is Mazzetti's collusion with the CIA an \"intelligence matter\" that prevents the NYT's managing editor from explaining what happened here? </p> <p>This is what the CIA <a href=\"http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/04/expert_consensus_obama_aping_bush_on_state_secrets.php/\">reflexively does</a>: insists that, even when it comes to allegations that they have engaged in serious wrongdoing, you (and even courts) cannot know what the agency is doing because it is an \"intelligence matter\". Now, here we have the managing editor of the Newspaper of Record reciting this same secrecy-loving phrase <em>verbatim</em> \u2013 as though the New York Times is some sort of an intelligence agency whose inner workings must be concealed for our own safety \u2013 all in order to avoid any sort of public disclosure about the wrongdoing in which it got caught engaging. One notices this frequently: media figures come to identify so closely with the government officials on whom they report that they start adopting not only their way of thinking, but even their lingo.</p> <p><em>Third</em>, note how Baquet proudly touts the fact that he knows facts to which you are not and will not be privvy:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I know the circumstances, if you knew everything that's going on, you'd know it's much ado about nothing.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Isn't the function of a newspaper supposed to be to tell us \"everything that's going on\", not to boast that it knows the circumstances and you do not?</p> <p>Baquet's claim that this was all \"much ado about nothing\" did not, apparently, sit well with at least some people at the New York Times, who seem not to appreciate it when their national security reporter secretly gives advanced copies of columns to the CIA spokesperson. Shortly after Baquet issued his ringing defense of Mazzetti's behavior, a spokesperson for the paper not only provided the details Baquet insisted could not be given, but also made clear that Mazzetti's conduct was inappropriate:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Last August, Maureen Dowd asked Mark Mazzetti to help check a fact for her column. In the course of doing so, he sent the entire column to a CIA spokeswoman shortly before her deadline. He did this without the knowledge of Ms Dowd. This action was a mistake that is not consistent with New York Times standards.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It may be \"inconsistent with the New York Times standards\" for one of its reporters to secretly send advanced copy to the CIA and then ask that the agency delete all record that he did so: one certainly hopes it is. But it is not, unfortunately, inconsistent with the paper's behavior in general, when it comes to reporting on public officials. Serving as obedient lapdogs and message-carriers for political power, rather than adversarial watchdogs over power, is par for the course.</p> <p>The most obvious example of this is the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/26/international/middleeast/26FTE_NOTE.html?pagewanted=all\">paper's complicity with propagating war-fueling falsehoods</a> to justify the attack on Iraq \u2013 though, in that instance, it was <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2007/04/10/media_failure/\">hardly alone</a>. Just last month, it <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/18/quote-approval-us-news-media-rethink\">was revealed</a> that the NYT routinely gives veto power to Obama campaign officials over the quotes from those officials the paper is allowed to publish \u2013 a practice <a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/182289/national-journal-mcclatchy-ban-quote-approval/\">barred by other outlets</a> (but not the NYT) both <a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/181346/ap-doesnt-let-sources-approve-quotes-beforehand/\">prior to</a> that revelation and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/23/us/politics/national-journal-bars-quotations-tweaked-by-sources.html\">subsequent to it</a>.</p> <p>Worse, the paper frequently conceals vital information of public interest at the direction of the government, as it did when it learned of George Bush's illegal eavesdropping program in mid 2004 but <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/16/AR2005121601716.html\">concealed it for more than a year</a> at the direction of the White House, until Bush was safely re-elected; as it did when it complied with government directives to <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/02/21/nyt_16/\">conceal the CIA employment</a> of Raymond Davis, captured by Pakistan, even as President Obama falsely described him as \"our diplomat in Pakistan\" and as the NYT reported the president's statement without noting that it was false; and as it did with its disclosure of numerous WikiLeaks releases, for which the paper, as former executive editor Bill Keller <a href=\"http://ggdrafts.blogspot.com.br/2012/07/bill-keller-and-us-government.html\">proudly boasted</a>, took direction from the government regarding what should and should not be published. </p> <p>And that's all independent of the <a href=\"http://www.fair.org/blog/2012/03/19/nyts-anonymous-drone-defenders/\">chronic practice</a> of the NYT to permit government officials to <a href=\"http://www.fair.org/blog/page/2/?s=New+York+Times+anonymity\">hide behind anonymity</a> in order to <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/04/05/state_dominated_media_and_iran/\">disseminate government propaganda</a> \u2013 or even to <a href=\"http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ask_this.view&amp;askthisid=562\">smear journalists as al-Qaida sympathizers</a> for reporting critically on government actions \u2013 even when granting such anonymity <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/22/opinion/22pubed.html\">violates its own publicly announced policies</a>.</p> <p>What all of this behavior from the NYT has in common is clear: it demonstrates the extent to which it institutionally collaborates with and serves the interests of the nation's most powerful factions, rather than act as an adversarial check on them. When he talks to the CIA spokesperson, Mazzetti sounds as if he's talking to a close colleague working together on a joint project.</p> <p>It sounds that way because that's what it is. </p> <p>One can, if one wishes, cynically justify Mazzetti's helpful co-operation with the CIA as nothing more than a common means which journalists use to curry favor with their sources. Leave aside the fact that the CIA spokesperson with whom Mazzetti is co-operating is hardly some valuable leaker deep within the bowels of the agency but, in theory, should be the supreme adversary of real journalists: her job is to shape public perception as favorably as possible to the CIA, even at the expense of the truth. </p> <p>The more important objection is that the fact that a certain behavior is common does not negate its being corrupt. Indeed, as is true for government abuses generally, those in power rely on the willingness of citizens to be trained to view corrupt acts as so common that they become inured, numb, to its wrongfulness. Once a corrupt practice is sufficiently perceived as commonplace, then it is transformed in people's minds from something objectionable into something acceptable. Indeed, many people believe it demonstrates their worldly sophistication to express indifference toward bad behavior by powerful actors on the ground that it is so prevalent. This cynicism \u2013 <em>oh, don't be naive: this is done all the time</em> \u2013 is precisely what enables such destructive behavior to thrive unchallenged.</p> <p>It is true that Mazzetti's emails with the CIA do not shock or surprise in the slightest. But that's the point. With some noble journalistic exceptions (at the NYT and elsewhere), these emails reflect the standard full-scale cooperation \u2013 a virtual merger \u2013 between our the government and the establishment media outlets that claim to act as \"watchdogs\" over them.</p> <p>From \"All the news that's fit to print\" to \"please delete after you read\" and cannot \"go into detail because it is an intelligence matter\": that's the gap between the New York Times's marketed brand and its reality.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong>: The Times' Public Editor <a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/29/pre-publication-disclosure-of-dowd-column-a-breach-of-two-boundaries/\">weighed in</a> on this matter today, noting his clear disapproval for what Mazzetti did: <br></p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"Whatever Mr. Mazzetti's motivation, it is a clear boundary violation to disclose a potentially sensitive article pre-publication under such circumstances. This goes well beyond the normal give-and-take that characterizes the handling of sources and suggests the absence of an arm's-length relationship between a reporter and those he is dealing with.\"<br></p> </blockquote> <p>While Mazzetti himself expresses regret for his behavior -- \"It was definitely a mistake to do. I have never done it before and I will never do it again\" -- both he and Executive Editor Jill Abramson insist that he had no bad intent, but was simply trying to help out a colleague (Dowd) by having her claims fact-checked. Like Baquet, Abramson invokes secrecy to conceal the key facts: \"I can't provide further detail on why the entire column was sent.\"</p> <p>The question raised by these excuses is obvious: if Mazzetti were acting with such pure and benign motives, why did he ask the CIA to delete the email he sent? This appears to be a classic case of expressing sorrow not over what one did, but over having been caught.</p> <p>On a different note, Politico's Byers, in response to my inquiry, advises me that Baquet did indeed say what Byers attributed to him -- \"he could not go into detail on the issue because it was an intelligence matter\" -- and that his exact quote was: it \"has to with intel.\"</p>",

Events on the ground on Wednesday, however, suggested otherwise, with heavy shelling near the capital Damascus and a major rebel attack on a strategic northern airbase.</p> <p>\"We are moving forward, the situation is practically getting better, but the victory needs more time,\" Assad said. He continued: \"We're fighting a regional and global battle and must have more time to resolve [it].\"</p> <p>The interview marks a rare public appearance for Assad, and follows a devastating explosion last month at his Damascus military-security command, which killed four of his top advisers. Assad laughed off claims that he had fled the capital, or escaped abroad, telling his interviewer: \"I'm here with you in Damascus inside the republican palace.\"</p> <p>The president also praised his country's embattled armed forces. Opposition activists and human rights groups accuse Assad's troops and pro-government shabiha militias of staging a series of massacres, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/28/syria-worst-massacre-daraya-death-toll-400?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">most recently in the town of Daraya</a>. Up to 400 people were reportedly killed there over the weekend. \"The army are doing their job. They are performing heroic acts in every sense of the word,\" Assad said.</p> <p>Assad also suggested outside diplomatic pressure to end the conflict made little difference, and said he did not think a no-fly zone over Syria would ever happen. \"The truth is that Syria doesn't need a green light when dealing with its internal affairs, neither from our allies or our enemies,\" he told the channel, owned by his cousin Rami Makhlouf, one of Syria's wealthiest men.</p> <p>Assad's remarks, showing him to be relaxed and calm, came as his new prime minister, Wael Nader al-Halqi, arrived in Tehran for a two-day summit. Iran, Assad's principal regional backer, proposed a three-month ceasefire inside Syria. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, also attended the non-aligned summit, with Egypt's new president, Mohamed Morsi, due to drop in on Thursday.</p> <p>But the Iranian initiative has little prospect of success and came amid another day of carnage across Syria. Residents in Ghouta, three miles (5km) east of Damascus, said they had been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/29/syria-crisis-live\" title=\"\">under bombardment from government tanks and warplanes for two days</a>. \"A lot of people are fleeing Ghouta to escape the random shooting, but they don't know where to go,\" one resident, Abu Omer, told the Guardian via Skype.</p> <p>Omer said the regime had punished the area \u2013 home to two million people \u2013 after fighters from the Free Syrian Army (FSA) shot down a warplane. He said the Syrian army was now converging in nearby Ain Terma and al-Miliha, and was attempting to storm the town. \"There are conveys of tanks and armoured vehicles full of soldiers on the highway that divides Damascus and eastern Ghouta. The snipers are shooting anyone in sight,\" he said. The regime had forced local bakeries to close, with food and medicines now in short supply, and was shooting civilians sheltering in their houses. The victims included two children in Juber aged seven and eight, and three women, he said.</p> <p>Omer's claims are impossible to verify. But <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C53MhZVkls&amp;feature=player_embedded\" title=\"\">video footage</a> posted on YouTube on Wednesday appears to show heavy bombardment of Ghouta, with residential buildings targeted next to a minaret and smoke billowing across the skyline. More than 40 people have been killed by pro-regime militias in outlying areas, activists said.</p> <p>In northern Syria, an armed Islamist rebel group claimed it had carried out a major attack on the Taftanaz airbase near the town of Idlib. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNgDy9XzsWQ&amp;feature=player_embedded\" title=\"\">At least five helicopters were destroyed</a>, it said, with the rebels assaulting the airbase using tanks captured from a Syrian military checkpoint and rocket-propelled grenades.</p> <p>\"The operation lasted for 40 minutes,\" one rebel commander, Tamiem al-Shami, told the Guardian via Skype. \"We were able to take out most of the defences at the base. We used a lot of fire against the helicopters and could see with our own eyes how the helicopters were burning.\" Shami said he was a member of the Ahrar al-Sham brigade in Idlib, an Islamic religious unit which was separate from the FSA but co-operated with it.</p> <p>Shami said three of his men were killed during the operation and one injured. The rebels withdrew when Syrian warplanes attacked their positions, he added. The Syrian state news agency Sana said forces loyal to the government had successfully repulsed the assault.</p> <p>Turkey's foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, meanwhile, said he would press the UN security council to set up a safe haven inside Syria to protect thousands of people fleeing the violence.</p> <p>Turkey has long been floating the idea of a no-fly zone, or buffer zone, to protect displaced Syrians from attacks by Assad's forces, but the issue has become more pressing now the number of refugees in Turkey has exceeded 80,000 \u2013 a number it says approaches its limits. \"We expect the UN to step in and protect the refugees inside Syria, and if possible, to shelter them in camps there,\" Davutoglu told reporters before leaving for New York to attend Thursday's high-level UN security council meeting on Syria.</p>",
  "<p>Dino Mahtani speculates that the rationale behind the west's development aid to Rwanda is still overwhelmingly guilt at the west's failure to stop the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/18/rwanda-unitednations\" title=\"\">1994 genocide</a> (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/01/rwanda-guilt-money-abuses-kagame\" title=\"\">More than guilty money</a>, 2 August).</p> <p>Mahtani accepts that Rwanda has made \"significant progress on state reconstruction\". But he accuses the government of Paul Kagame of \"increasing levels of authoritarianism\" and \"intimidating opposition politicians and journalists\". What he fails to mention is that in recent years Rwanda has totally overhauled its judicial administration, putting in an independent ombudsman, ditching capital punishment and creating a UN-approved system that allows suspects to be returned to Rwanda for trial. Vital checks and balances are in place, and there has been a clampdown on those who abuse positions in government or business. The people Mahtani refers to as \"high-ranking regime defectors\" are in fact officials who fled after discovering their corrupt practices will no longer be tolerated \u2013 something that should be applauded, not criticised.</p> <p>Let us be clear. Rwanda has spent more than half its 50 years since independence in a state of immense insecurity, with massacres organised by its government from 1962-1994, and ethnic and regional divisions and spiralling corruption wrecking every part of society. To treat Rwanda, as critics like Mahtani do, as some typical European country with bountiful resources, peaceful neighbours and centuries of stable, democratic governance is to badly misjudge the situation.</p> <p>He attacks the \"fragile\" political system, yet paradoxically accuses Kagame of being \"authoritarian\" and in total control. Rwanda is evolving in all areas of society and governance, though it will take many more years of the current growth and stability to achieve all the government's objectives. There has been a huge increase in private newspapers and radio stations \u2013 which, given the media's role in the genocide, is in itself a sign of progress.</p> <p>Mahtani claims Rwanda has been continually meddling in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, supporting \"Tutsi warlord\" Laurent Nkunda and his deputy Bosco Ntaganda. Rwanda's government has, in a highly detailed document, answered every charge raised in the recent <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18612612\" title=\"\">UN group of experts report</a>, its explanation <a href=\"http://www.newtimes.co.rw/news/index.php?i=15074&amp;a=56731\" title=\"\">accepted by the Dutch ambassador as \"very serious and satisfactory\"</a>. For example, the report alleged Rwanda supplied stocks of 75mm recoilless rocket launchers and grenades to rebel groups. Yet these very weapons were destroyed in Rwanda under a regional small arms agreement in 2008 under the close supervision of such \"experts\". Such a fundamental error raises troubling questions about the integrity of the entire GoE process.</p> <p>Mahtani argues that Rwanda wants to steal the DRC's raw materials. In fact Rwanda is one of the few countries in the region to agree to certify all minerals that originate from Rwanda and ensure all mineral trade is tagged and traceable. The DRC government has publicly acknowledged this, and our development partners have supported this mineral tagging programme.</p> <p>Rwanda engages positively with regional and international partners on peacebuilding in the DRC. It pushed hard at last month's International Conference on the Great Lakes Region in Kampala for a new independent border force to disarm all militias. Rwanda's strategic interests in the region would be greatly at risk were there a recurrence of conflict in the DRC. Rwanda, like all nations, wants secure borders and is actively working at local, national and international levels to achieve this.</p>",
  "<p>If the Venice film festival needed an electric charge to shock it into motion, it came midway through the world premiere of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/29/reluctant-fundamentalist-review?intcmp=ILCMUSTXT9384\" title=\"\">The Reluctant Fundamentalist</a>, when a Wall Street hotshot watches the planes hit the World Trade Centre and then flashes an exultant smile at his TV screen. \"In that moment I should have felt sorrow or anger,\" our hero confesses. \"But all I felt was awe.\"</p> <p>The Reluctant Fundamentalist \u2013 directed by Mira Nair from the novel by Mohsin Hamid \u2013 is a globalised rites-of-passage tale, torn between two worlds, pointed towards disaster, and damning capitalism and terrorism with the same brush. Yet while the material may be contentious, its director insisted that the film be viewed as a dialogue rather than a confrontation.</p> <p>\"I hope American audiences receive it as it was intended \u2013 as a film made by people who understand what it is to love America,\" Nair said. \"I hope they see it as a conversation between two cultures that goes beyond the prejudices that contaminate us. I really believe, unlike George W Bush, that it's not a case of 'You're either with us or against us'. There is a third way. There is common ground.\"</p> <p>The Reluctant Fundamentalist stars the British actor Riz Ahmed as Changez, a Pakistani immigrant who first chases and then rejects the American dream, eventually falling in with a group of radical Islamists back in his native Lahore.</p> <p>\"Changez grows up between two worlds, and as a British Pakistani I can relate to that,\" Ahmed explained. \"I attended a university [Oxford] where my cultural background was very different to those around me. But the film is about getting rid of those labels and stereotypes \u2013 or at least stretching the labels wide enough so that we can live inside them comfortably.\"</p> <p>It could be argued that The Reluctant Fundamentalist brings its director full circle. Indian-born and New York-based, Nair won the Venice Golden Lion award for her 2001 drama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/89830/monsoon.wedding\" title=\"\">Monsoon Wedding</a>. The prize was handed out on 9 September, - just 48 hours before the terrorist attacks.</p> <p>\"I remember it well,\" said Nair, now 54. \"I live in New York. My husband and family were in the city. It took me a week to get back there and, when I did, the whole place reminded me of images from my home country \u2013 the refugee camps, the sense of a war zone, the sense of fear. In New York you rarely hear anyone speaking English. Everyone is a foreigner and yet everyone belongs. But suddenly it became a place where everyone who looked like us was viewed as 'the other'. It was a deeply disturbing time \u2013 both for us and for the world.\"</p> <p>The Reluctant Fundamentalist sets the stage for what is being regarded as a mouthwatering lineup at this year's festival. Potential highlights include To the Wonder, a new drama from the revered director <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/terrence-malick\" title=\"\">Terrence Malick</a>, and Spring Breakers, a student heist caper shot by the iconoclastic American film-maker <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/harmony-korine\" title=\"\">Harmony Korine</a>.

Among the new arrivals are Hinde Boujemaa, whose documentary, It Was Better Tomorrow, probes the consequences of the Tunisian revolution, and Haifaa al-Mansour, reportedly Saudi Arabia's first female feature film director. \"A festival should not just be a catwalk for celebrities,\" Barbera has insisted.</p> <p>Those in the running for this year's Golden Lion must convince a panel headed by Michael Mann, the American director behind <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/60365/heat\" title=\"\">Heat</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/81962/insider\" title=\"\">The Insider</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/129313/public-enemies\" title=\"\">Public Enemies</a>. Asked by Barbera to deliver an opening statement, Mann appeared momentarily stumped before electing to keep it simple. \"We have a terrific jury,\" he said. \"Everyone is looking forward to seeing some exciting work over the next 10 days.\" When navigating a confusing, shifting, globalised world, it is sometimes best to focus on the fundamentals.</p>",
  "<p>Freddie Fletcher, who has died aged 71 of asbestos-related cancer, once told an interviewer that the fictional character he most admired was Roy of the Rovers, and that he would have liked to score the winning goal for Newcastle United in an FA Cup at Wembley. His contribution to the success of the club, however, came off the field, and although Newcastle did not win any trophies while the Scot was chief executive, it was not for the want of effort, as he played a significant role in transforming the fortunes of the club in the 1990s.</p> <p>He had already helped lift Glasgow Rangers out of a long period of underachievement into a position of dominance in Scottish football when he was persuaded to become involved in Sir John Hall's takeover of Newcastle, who were then on the brink both of administration and relegation to the third tier of the league.</p> <p>In eight years he increased their turnover tenfold but, more importantly, helped spark a footballing renaissance at St James' Park with the appointment as manager of the club's former forward Kevin Keegan. The Magpies challenged for the Premier League title and played in Europe thanks to an exciting, attacking team of star players financed by Fletcher's work.</p> <p>\"Three things make a successful football club,\" Fletcher said later. \"A history of tradition in football, a population catchment area, and how well or how badly it's run. If you've got the first two, you've got a wee chance \u2013 you can't change them, but you can change the third.\"</p> <p>Fletcher was born in Greenock, attending Greenock high school and studying business at Strathclyde University. He joined the John Lawrence group of companies, eventually rising to marketing director, but also pursued a political career, serving as a Liberal councillor in Greenock and holding the post of provost from 1977 to 1980. His other passion was football, and he became a director of Greenock Morton FC in 1978.</p> <p>When the Lawrence group acquired control of Rangers in 1985, he became the club's commercial director. Rangers had slipped behind not only Celtic but also Aberdeen and Dundee United in the Scottish hierarchy, with gates down to 17,000, but Fletcher helped lay the financial foundations for a run of nine successive titles between 1989 and 1997. He also became treasurer of the Scottish Football League and a member of the International League Board.</p> <p>In 1991, Fletcher was asked by Rangers' sponsors, Scottish &amp; Newcastle, to consult on the situation at Newcastle, whom they also sponsored. \"It was similar to Rangers, an enormous club underachieving,\" he said. \"Newcastle were deep in financial debt with attendances of 11,000.\" However, there was a potential saviour in Hall, who offered Fletcher the job of chief executive if he could complete a takeover.</p> <p>Fletcher moved to Tyneside in February 1992 and set about restructuring the club. Arguably his most important decision was to persuade Keegan out of retirement to replace Osvaldo Ardiles as manager. Under Keegan, Newcastle narrowly avoided relegation from the old second division in the 1991-92 season and set their sights on the newly formed Premier League.</p> <p>The team flourished, finishing as runners-up in the Premier League and qualifying for the Champions League thanks to new signings whose purchase was made possible by Fletcher's efforts. He led the flotation of the club in May 1997, and in 1999 became chairman of the resulting PLC. According to Freddy Shepherd, the club chairman, he revelled in his nickname there of the Rottweiler, and the growth that he was overseeing did not please everyone.</p> <p>In 2000 an attempt to move 4,000 season-ticket holders to make way for corporate areas during the expansion of the stadium capacity from 29,000 to 52,000 was settled only in the court of appeal, a battle that left bitter memories. \"No person is bigger than the club,\" Fletcher said. \"It doesn't matter who they are.\"</p> <p>He left St James' Park in July 2000 to pursue other business ventures and interests that included construction, film, security, sports law, and social care charities, leaving Newcastle United unrecognisable from the club he had joined. It had reached two FA Cup finals, regularly filled its 52,000-capacity stadium and boasted a talented squad including Alan Shearer, the England centre-forward. It was now managed by Bobby Robson, whom Fletcher had brought back to his native north-east.</p> <p>He retained close links with the club and was a member of the launch committee of the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation in 2008, the year before the death of the beloved former England manager from cancer. Fletcher's own cancer was diagnosed at the start of this year.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Margaret, two sons and a daughter.</p> <p>\u2022 Freddie (Alfred) Fletcher, football executive, born 20 March 1941; died 27 August 2012</p>",
  "<p>Drastically reducing calorie intake may not be as effective as previously thought for prolonging lifespan, according to a 23-year study published in Nature.</p> <p>The idea that eating less could slow the ageing process was sparked in the 1930s when researchers at Cornell University found that rats and mice given a restricted diet <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/15813?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101009389343\" title=\"\">could live 40% longer</a>, and the concept has since been confirmed by studies on <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1474-9726.2006.00261.x/abstract\" title=\"\">fruit flies</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/95/22/13091.abstract\" title=\"\">roundworms</a>.</p> <p>In 2009, gerontologist Richard Weindruch of the University of Wisconsin showed that a moderately calorie-restricted diet <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2812811/\" title=\"\">slowed ageing in rhesus monkeys</a> over the course of 20 years.</p> <p>But a new study on rhesus monkeys, carried out by the US National Institute on Aging (NIA) in Bethesda, Maryland, has found no overall benefit to longevity from calorie-restricted diets.</p> <p>In this study, led by the NIA's Julie Mattison and <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature11432\" title=\"\">published on Wednesday</a> in Nature, rhesus monkeys were given 30% fewer calories compared with control animals over a 23-year period. Whether the monkeys were relatively young or in their teens at the start of the study, Mattison's team found no increase in longevity for the calorie-restricted animals.</p> <p>But they confirmed, however, that eating less can improve health by delaying the onset of diseases such as diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease.</p> <p>Mattison's team regularly measured glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride fats to assess the potential health benefits of the diet. \"Cholesterol levels were significantly lower in treated males than in untreated males, but were unaffected in females,\" wrote <a href=\"http://www.barshop.uthscsa.edu/main/facultystaff/barshopfaculty/u17\" title=\"\">Steven Austad, a biologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio</a>, Texas, in an <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature11484.html\" title=\"\">accompanying article</a> in Nature.</p> <p>He said that the different conclusions between the Wisconsin and NIA studies might be because of the composition of the monkeys' respective diets. The diets were similar in the amount of carbohydrates, proteins and fats the monkeys ate. But they differed in the specific types of these nutrients \u2013 for example, 28.5% of the diet of the Wisconsin monkeys was made from sucrose, whereas the sugar only made up 3.9% of the NIA diet.</p> <p>\"Possibly related to this difference, more than 40% of the [Wisconsin] control animals and only 12.5% of the NIA controls developed diabetes \u2013 although this metabolic malfunction was completely absent in the [Wisconsin] calorie-restricted animals, but not in the treated animals in the NIA study,\" wrote Austad.</p> <p>Another difference was that the control monkeys in the NIA study were given specific amounts of food, whereas the Wisconsin monkeys could eat as much as they liked. \"Consequently, NIA control animals weighed less and were considerably longer-lived than the WNPRC controls,\" wrote Austad.</p> <p>\"One interpretation \u2026 is that the NIA controls were partially restricted, which would account for the lack of a survival effect of the treatment in the NIA study. Nevertheless, all animals in both studies \u2013 even in the calorie-restricted groups \u2013 weighed more than wild-caught monkeys.\"</p>",

The report is expected to be published in the autumn.</p> <p>Rule 13 letters are by their nature one-sided as they are solely about giving individuals or corporate bodies an opportunity to give reasons why criticism in the final report in a public inquiry is not justified.</p> <p>Blackhurst said Leveson could be presenting the worst-possible scenario and would subsequently rein in the criticism.</p> <p>However, Leveson has made it clear during public hearings that the letters are part of the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/1838/made\" title=\"Inquiry rules\">process</a> which the inquiry must legally carry out. Clause 13 (3) of Rule 13 states that an \"inquiry panel must not include any explicit or significant criticism of a person in the report, or in any interim report, unless the chairman has sent that person a warning letter; and the person has been given a reasonable opportunity to respond to the warning letter\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/29/leveson-rulings-excoriating-criticism-press\" title=\"\">Others who have seen the letter </a>said the appeals court judge has thrown the \"kitchen sink\" at the newspaper industry. \"It is excoriating,\" said one newspaper industry source.</p> <p>Blackhurst said the letter is not written in emotional language or filled with \"red-blooded adjectives\", adding that it is a straightforward, point-by-point list of criticisms of the industry.</p> <p>\"Presented as an overall picture, it is a damning indictment of my industry,\" he added.</p> <p>Blackhurst, who did not go into detail about the contents of the letter because of strict legal rules about confidentiality, said \"there was an awful lot in there unjustified \u2026 [which] I don't recognise in relation to ourselves\".</p> <p>Blackhurst's comments angered Leveson who sanctioned a statement saying he was \"disappointed that the contents of confidential letters\" were being \"openly discussed in the press\".</p> <p>The statement said the \"misrepresentation\" of the letters was \"not without significance\". \"By their nature such letters are, of course, one sided document and are not intended (as it makes clear) to deal with the positive aspects of the activities of the press: plainly, no warning is necessary for that purpose,\" it added.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the former Times journalist Patrick Foster was arrested on Wednesday by Metropolitan police detectives investigating computer hacking. Foster was arrested at his home address in north London early on Wednesday morning and questioned at a north London police station. The Met said the arrest related to suspected offences under the Computer Misuse Act and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.</p> <p>Scotland Yard added that the arrest related to the \"identification of a previously anonymous blogger in 2009\". The blogger is understood to be Richard Horton, a police constable who was unmasked by the Times as the man behind the NightJack blog in July 2009. Horton's blog, which won the prestigious Orwell prize for its descriptions of a PC's life, was then closed down and he was reprimanded by his police superiors. Foster was later released on bail to a date in November, police said.</p>",
  "<p>Malcolm Browne, who has died aged 81, was one of those people who were in the right place, at the right time, and knew what to do. He was the Associated Press's young bureau chief in Saigon on 11 June 1963.</p> <p>That day, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Governor George Wallace struck an attitude, intending to make himself the hero of the segregationist south, by \"standing in the schoolhouse door\" to ban black students from the state university. In Washington, the US president John F Kennedy was coming to terms with the two crises that would transform American history and his administration: the civil rights revolution in the south, and the decision whether or not to send American troops to prop up the tottering US-supported regime in South Vietnam.</p> <p>Ngo Dinh Diem, the Roman Catholic puppet president in Saigon, was reluctant to give democracy a chance. He was ineffectual in fighting the communist Vietcong guerrillas. With supreme folly, he picked a quarrel with the Buddhist majority in his half of Vietnam. In early May, two of his brothers, a provincial governor and an archbishop, had been involved in an incident when someone threw a grenade into a peaceful Buddhist demonstration and killed eight monks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395415251\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346327089051/Malcolm-Browne-001.jpg\" alt=\"Malcolm Browne\" width=\"200\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Browne worked alongside Hunter S Thompson on a local newspaper in upstate New York. Photograph: AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Buddhists were no political innocents. On 11 June, a number of western journalists and photographers received a telephone call from Saigon's main Buddhist pagoda: be outside the Cambodian embassy for a \"very important\" happening. Browne was the only one who went. At the appointed time, an elderly monk, Thich Quang Duc, appeared and sat on a pillow in the lotus position. Two of his disciples doused him with aviation fuel, and he set himself alight. Browne shot six or eight rolls of 35mm film.</p> <p>Browne's picture went around the world. In Washington, Robert Kennedy was calling his brother, the president, to talk about Alabama when Jack Kennedy, still in bed in the White House, saw Browne's picture on the front page of the New York Times. \"Jesus Christ!\" he said.</p> <p>Within months Diem had lost US backing and that November he was assassinated. In 1964 Browne and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/apr/25/guardianobituaries.pressandpublishing\" title=\"\">David Halberstam</a> of the New York Times jointly won the Pulitzer prize for \"their individual reporting of the Vietnam war and the overthrow of the Diem regime\".</p> <p>Browne, a reflective man, said later that he was not particularly proud of the picture. He insisted that he could not have stopped the monk's suicide if he had tried, as there were 200 monks there to prevent that. But from time to time he admitted that he wondered whether he had played a part in the agonising death of a gentle old man.</p> <p>Malcolm Wilde Browne \u2013 his grandfather was a cousin of Oscar Wilde \u2013 was born in New York and went to Swarthmore, an excellent Quaker college near Philadelphia, where he gained a degree in chemistry. In 1956 he was sent to Korea as a tank driver, but managed to transfer to an army newspaper. When he was demobbed he went to work for a local newspaper in upstate New York, where one of his colleagues was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2005/feb/22/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\" title=\"\">Hunter S Thompson</a>, later the author of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. In 1960, after brief stints on two other news agencies, Browne joined the AP, which sent him to Saigon in 1961.</p> <p>There he became part of a group of little more than half a dozen young American reporters, including Halberstam and Neil Sheehan of UPI (and from 1964 of the New York Times), whose sceptical reporting of the Vietnam war had an immense influence on opinion back home. To begin with, they were not necessarily against the American support for the Diem government, but they soon became extremely critical of how the war was being fought. It was important that where President Kennedy and his top advisers, like the generals in Vietnam, were members of the \"GI generation\", Browne, Halberstam and their friends were too young to have absorbed the all-confident, super-patriotic ethos of the victors of the second world war.</p> <p>Halberstam wrote later that he and his friends, including Browne, \"kept showing up in the countryside, and it was only a matter of time before they saw how hollow the entire operation was, how many lies were being told, and how fraudulent the war was\". The American brass in Saigon hated them. No less a figure than Admiral Harry Felt, the top commander in the whole Pacific, shouted at Browne to \"get on the team\". More subtly, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/obituaries/05krulak.html\" title=\"\">General Victor \"Brute\" Krulak</a>, a gung-ho Marine, put it about that the reporters were so young that they burst into tears when they saw dead bodies.</p> <p>In fact Browne became a crafty operator and as tough as nails. He later claimed to have survived being shot down three times in combat aircraft, and to have been expelled from half a dozen countries. He was put on a \"death list\" in Saigon. When South Vietnamese agents tried to arrest his wife because she had left her job in the government, Browne stood them off with a replica submachine gun.</p> <p>In 1967 he left AP and after an unhappy year in television news joined the New York Times, where he remained&nbsp;for 30 years. He worked in Latin America and, aged 60, covered the 1991 Gulf war, but he also wrote about science. Colleagues described him variously as cerebral, secretive and \"classy\". In 2000 he was diagnosed with&nbsp;Parkinson's disease.</p> <p>He is survived by his third wife, Le Lieu, whom he married in 1966, a son, Timothy, and daughter, Wendy.</p> <p>\u2022 Malcolm Wilde Browne, journalist, born 17 April 1931; died 27 August 2012</p>",
  "<p><strong>Reed Elsevier</strong> has been facing some concerns about the impact of open access publishing on its business, but analysts at JP Morgan Cazenove reckon the threat has been overdone.</p> <p>They raised their rating on Reed from neutral to overweight, saying:</p> <blockquote> Despite much news flow around open access publishing, we expect open access initiatives to have little or no impact on Reed's Science and Health revenues and profits. As open access journals gain traction, we see open access article processing fees increasing and envisage that open access revenues (where Reed has already an established position) can compensate for any subscription journal revenue pressure. <br> We think the company has turned the corner and see a two-leg story developing. First, a re-rating \u2013 the first half [results] provided data to support management's restructuring efforts with all five divisions moving in a positive direction and improving communication. Second, we see a potential upgrade to well-underpinned estimates to follow later with improving organic growth (Science, Risk, Exhibitions) and margins (Reed Business Information, Legal), and further buyback potential (every \u00a3200m adds 1% to earnings per share.) </blockquote> <p>Reed's shares closed 11p higher at 589p, bucking a downbeat market trend.

  "<p>For many observers, religion is an emblematic feature of American politics. It is seen as a unique and confounding manifestation of American exceptionalism, in which religious fervor co-exists with an industrialized, \"modern\" democracy and an explicitly secular state. The course of the presidential race thus far might be viewed as yet another instance of America's particular obsession with religion. Yet this campaign, for all its familiar tropes, both departs from the historical American norm and remind us that the US is not so unusual in its mix of religion and politics, after all.</p> <p>Even before Paul Ryan's selection for the Republican ticket, Rick Santorum's and Mitt Romney's primary campaigns for president meant that religion had already played a particularly vivid version of its familiar role in American electoral politics \u2013 one which went beyond the usual prayer breakfasts, pastoral exhortations, allegations of theological unsoundness, and public proclamations of the candidate's commitment to Jesus, Christianity, and America united under one God.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/jan/05/rick-santorum-christianist-mantle\">ultra-Catholic Rick Santorum</a>, with his critique of Obama's \"false theology\", his passionate pronouncements on the evils of birth control and abortion, and his statement that John F Kennedy's advocacy of the separation of church and state \"made him want to throw up\", was coupled with the ongoing saga of Mitt Romney \u2013 the candidate no one seemed to want but had to choose \u2013 and his Mormonism, which raised the question of whether the adherents of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints deserved to stand under broad and sheltering umbrella of American Christianity. The nomination of Ryan, with his ostensibly seamless dual commitment to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/13/paul-ryan-ayn-rand-romney\">teachings of both the Catholic Church and the church of Ayn Rand</a>, means that religion in the 2012 election has taken an even more prominent role as the Republican party convention is held this week.</p> <p>This might seem to be yet another round, albeit a particularly intense one, of the usual order at the bar. Yet, only a few decades ago, both the Santorum candidacy and the Ryan nomination would have been unthinkable. In the 1960 election, Kennedy's Catholicism meant he had repeatedly to disavow loyalties to Rome, and argue that a Catholic president would not be beholden to a foreign power. Evangelical leaders openly opposed the candidate on grounds of his \"popishness\", and fretted about its implications for America. Yet, Rick Santorum not only faced few questions regarding his Catholic views, but even became a darling of many evangelical leaders. The pattern appears to be repeating itself with evangelical responses to Ryan.</p> <p>So what changed?</p> <p>Evangelicals rose to national office in the United States with the election of Jimmy Carter in 1976, and during the next decades, came to even greater prominence in the civic sphere as figures such as the Reverend Jerry Falwell issued proclamations that \"God is calling millions of Americans in the so-often silent majority to join in the moral majority crusade to turn America around.\" The 1990s brought Ralph Reed's Christian Coalition and the evangelical mega-churches to the center of American politics as they became the foundation of a reliable constituency for the GOP.</p> <p>At the same time, in a development that received far less attention than the evangelicals' entry into politics, they were forging a new coalition with Catholics \u2013 centered around a version of what then Pope John Paul II called the \"culture of life\". While the original iteration espoused respect for life from conception to death, including opposition to the death penalty, the new, carefully edited consensus promoted by the coalition focused on anti-abortion and pro-life rhetoric, while remaining silent or supporting the death penalty; it espoused traditional gender roles, was suspicious of government in general and its regulation of schooling in particular, and vehemently opposed gay rights, much less marriage equality.</p> <p>Conservative Catholics and evangelicals now spoke a common language, sidestepping the thorny issues of theology and doctrine that had divided them in the past (such as their differing views on divorce). More importantly, the coalition put an end to the question of whether a conservative Catholic could be a real American, since this quality of authenticity was increasingly clustered around Christian religiosity writ large, and allegiance on a certain set of social issues, rather than requiring adherence to a particular denominational form.</p> <p>It was this coalition that provided the backbone of Santorum's support. Similarly, it will ensure that Ryan \u2013 with his staunch record of opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage \u2013 appeals to evangelical Protestant constituents. The new alliance made it easy for Santorum to speak to evangelicals, as well as Catholics, as if he were one of them, because, in many senses, he was. Ironically, his political views are far to the right of those espoused by most Catholics, who still identify primarily as Democrats, but his admixture of religious fervor, \"pro-family\" stances, and conservative theological views appealed all the more to evangelical voters and their leaders.</p> <p>All of this might seem to underscore the exceptional (and exceptionally peculiar) nature of US politics. But a wider, international perspective only shows Americans to be far more ordinary in their blending of faith and politics. A brief look at Polish or Philippine politics reveals the Roman Catholic church constantly muscling in on the political arena, and politicians of all stripes who are only too happy to kowtow to the Church's assertion of moral authority. Before he became a would-be authoritarian, Viktor Orban in Hungary, for example, became an advocate of religious interests in politics. Ireland, Israel, and Malta are all polities that have been long dominated by religious monopolies accustomed to obtaining enormous concessions in education, the welfare state, and reproductive technologies.</p> <p>And these are just some of the world's democracies. As the Islamic republics and religious monarchies of the Middle East and South Asia show, there's a still broader pantheon of polities where religion makes regular and institutionalized incursions into politics.</p> <p>It's enough to make Americans feel positively normal, even relatively secular.</p>",
  "<p>Political wrangling over the US budget has hit profits at London-listed outsourcing company Serco, which runs everything from air-traffic control to nuclear facilities and prisons across the world.</p> <p>The company said US government agencies had postponed contract awards, delayed work, and cancelled contracts because of the stalemate over the debt ceiling.</p> <p>Serco chief executive, Chris Hyman, said the company does not expect a solution to the debt crisis \"until the presidential election and until we have a new Congress in place\". He said the US market will continue to be \"tough\" in the second half, but that it will grow in the long-term. \"People are screaming for work to be done, they are just trying to agree their funding.\"</p> <p>Overall, profits before tax and one-off items slumped 17% in the first half to \u00a3102m. In the UK, Serco saw a decline in welfare-to-work contracts but said that was offset by other contract wins, such as the deal to provide ferry services to the northern isles in Scotland.</p> <p>Hyman said: \"The UK is starting to move again. I'm cautiously optimistic about that. There were questions over whether the government would go deep into public sector reform. We've seen them do what they said.\"</p> <p>Last month, Serco won a \u00a337m contract to provide community punishment programmes in London, becoming the first private company to take over a significant portion of work from the probation service.</p> <p>The group won \u00a34.2bn of contracts in the first half, up from \u00a32.5bn in the same period last year, boosted by a \u00a31.5bn joint venture with the Ministry of Defence to provide and maintain the UK's nuclear warheads.</p> <p>It also booked \u00a315.7m of restructuring costs in the first half, which went towards creating a global business process outsourcing division to help it win more back-office work.</p>",

Along with her colleague Katherine Wallis, 45, she dragged Robinson across her bedroom floor, making the elderly woman scream in pain. Wallis then threatened her with violence.</p> <p>Abuse spanning five days was captured on the hidden CCTV camera after Robinson's family became concerned about bruises on her body and saw that she was more distressed than usual. She suffers from dementia and had lived at the home for six years.</p> <p>Richard Butters, for the prosecution, told the court that the footage, from between 11 and 16 November 2011, showed Robinson was subjected to an array of \"utterly undignified\" treatment.</p> <p>Bryan was sentenced to four months at Leeds crown court on Wednesday and Wallis was given a 12-month community order.</p> <p>Butters explained that Robinson's daughter, Angela Wood, gave up work to help Oakfoss staff to care for her mother. But Wood became increasingly concerned about how she was being treated.</p> <p>He said: \"Angela Wood and her husband, Simon Wood, started to see bruises developing on Ivy Robinson's hands. She was also becoming rather distressed, more so than usual, when her daughter was about to leave. Having their suspicions, Simon Wood, the son-in-law, put a covert camera into his mother-in-law's room. The footage that's on that camera is distressing.\"</p> <p>The video showed Bryan swearing at Robinson, and calling her a \"horrible old lady\" and a \"nasty old cow\", Butters said. The footage also revealed that Bryan had not given the pensioner her medicine properly and showed her striking her on the hand and shaking her before telling her to \"piss off\".</p> <p>On one occasion, both Bryan and Wallis dragged Robinson between her chair and bed, \"completely ignoring the wishes of Ivy, chatting among themselves\", he said. \"It's at that point one can hear Ivy shrieking.\"</p> <p>A care assistant trainer who viewed the footage described it as the worst case of ill-treatment and neglect she had ever seen and said she was \"physically upset\" by the recording, the court heard.</p> <p>Bryan pleaded guilty to four counts of wrongly administering medicine. Both women also pleaded guilty to ill-treatment by moving a patient in an unapproved manner.</p> <p>Judge Guy Kearl QC banned both women from working with vulnerable adults. He said the case represented a serious breach of trust and left Robinson and her family deeply upset.</p> <p>The judge said: \"This lady doesn't seem to have caused you any problems at all, which makes this treatment seem somewhat gratuitous. You've known perfectly well that what you were doing was simply wrong. This neglect and ill-treatment is unforgivable and unacceptable. You failed to accord respect and dignity to this respectful elderly lady.\"</p> <p>The judge gave Bryan and Wallis, who are both from the Pontefract area, credit for pleading guilty at Pontefract magistrates court in July.</p> <p>Following the hearing, Robinson's daughter and son-in-law said they were finding it difficult to come to terms with the abuse.</p> <p>In a statement read by their solicitor, Anne Robertson, a medical negligence specialist, they said: \"Mum was a resident at Oakfoss House to be cared for and looked after. However, due to the failings of Oakfoss House, over a five night period, mum was physically, verbally and medically neglected and abused by staff who should have provided this care.</p> <p>\"It is difficult to describe the effect this abuse has had on mum, our family and our lives but to see what mum was subjected to sickened and horrified us. This will never leave our memories. Moreover we feel as though we have let mum down.</p> <p>\"The decision to install the CCTV came as a last resort and was a culmination of various incidents over a period of months that could not be explained by staff at Oakfoss. The final trigger was when mum became agitated and frightened when it came time for us to leave on an evening. She would cry and ask us not to leave.</p> <p>\"No one knows how long this abuse and neglect had been going on for. We hope that other families can learn from mum's ordeal and be aware of certain signs. Just because someone has dementia does not mean that they do not know what is going on \u2013 please listen to them and act.\"</p> <p>The Woods decided to move Robinson out of Oakfoss House and are now taking further legal advice.</p>",

Only a few walkers, cyclists, and official cars casually broke the silence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Barta/flickr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395104809\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345733747689/Carpenter-s-Estate-Stratf-027.jpg\" alt=\"Camera Club: Peter Barta: Carpenter\u00b4s Estate, Stratford\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/peterbarta/7832260646/\">Carpenter\u00b4s Estate, Stratford</a>.

  "<p>What do you think of when you hear the words \"female empowerment\"? Equal pay, the pill, the vote\u2026 Or, according to Indian pharmaceutical company, Ultratech, a tighter vagina.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPayFrCOiZM\" title=\"\">An advert</a> for the dubiously named 18 Again, a \"vaginal tightening and rejuvenation cream\", <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-19353039\" title=\"\">has caused an outcry in India</a>. In it, a sari-clad woman dances around her husband singing \"I feel like a virgin\". He's very happy about it, despite the fact that most of his family seem to be present. Her mother-in-law (just who you want to witness the joy of your newly tightened female genitalia), first looks disapproving, but ends up ordering some for herself as her delighted husband looks on.</p> <p>The video is ridiculous, but it has prompted serious debate. While it is not the first cream of its kind \u2013 similar products, such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Intivar\" title=\"\">Intivar</a>, are already on sale in the US and elsewhere \u2013 it does demonstrate conflicting forces in modern Indian society. Attitudes to sexuality are beginning to relax, particularly in big cities \u2013 but conservative morality remains powerful.</p> <p>For the vast majority of people in India, premarital sex is taboo. A poll last year by <a href=\"http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/sexual-identity-sex-life-one-night-stand/1/161406.html\" title=\"\">India Today</a> magazine found that fewer than one in five (19%) of respondents were open to the idea of pre-marital sex or live-in relationships. This is despite the fact that people are having sex earlier: <a href=\"http://www.durexnetwork.org/en-GB/research/faceofglobalsex/Pages/Home.aspx\" title=\"\">another survey</a> showed the average age at which Indians lose their virginity dropping from 23 in 2006 to 19.8 in 2011. Behaviour, then, is changing, particularly in urban areas. But whatever people are doing behind closed doors, social attitudes are slower to catch up. Tellingly, in the India Today survey, a quarter of people said they had no objection to sex before marriage, as long as it was not happening in their family.</p> <p>While India is fast becoming the next superpower, this rapid economic growth is not matched by a corresponding sexual revolution. Although India's enormous size and range in terms of development and attitudes makes it difficult to generalise, shame culture remains powerful and pervasive. The obsession with virginity \u2013 a manifestation of the desire to control the female body \u2013 is a symptom of this. At best, in more liberal areas such as the major cities, you might see attitudes equivalent to \"slut-shaming\" in the west. People are secretive about their activities, and women known to have had several sexual partners may be seen as less desirable. At worst, in rural areas or among poorer communities, sex outside marriage <a href=\"http://tribune.com.pk/story/390278/an-honour-killing-in-india/\" title=\"\">can mean complete social exclusion or even death</a>. It is not uncommon for divorced women to be rejected in their villages, seen as licentious and dangerous because they are not virgins.</p> <p>Against this backdrop, Ultratech's claim that the product aims to \"empower women\" rings false. \"Men have so many products they can buy to enhance their sexual pleasure, this is just putting sexual enhancement in the hands of women,\" says Rishi Bhatia, the company's owner. It is noteworthy that he is using the language of sexual empowerment at all, but who does it provide pleasure for? Of course, it's the man. Most women would agree that losing their virginity was far from being their most pleasurable sexual encounter.</p> <p>Dressed up as empowerment for women, but propagating deeply conservative values, 18 Again indicates that despite increasing consumerism, India has not let go of its repressive attitudes to female sexuality. While the backlash in Indian newspapers and websites shows that women are fighting back, it is anyone's guess how long it will take for this battle against the dual forces of patriarchy and consumerism in Indian society to be won.</p>",
  "<p>In <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/opinion/sunday/success-and-risk-as-the-times-transforms.html?_r=4&amp;smid=tw-share\">his last column as the New York Times' public editor, or ombudsman, Arthur Brisbane admonished the newspaper</a> for what he called an unstated \"progressivism\" that bled through the journalism on a semi-regular basis. He was right in one sense: the Times does, from my perspective, view the world through a lens that affects its journalism, and the paper doesn't forthrightly say so.</p> <p>But that worldview is more nuanced than Brisbane's label. The Times is, without doubt, progressive on social issues, not just on its editorial pages but also in the news pages. It is less so in other arenas. Despite some reporting that has infuriated the powers-that-be from time to time, the paper's evidently close ties to the New York and Washington power elites have given it a justified reputation for coziness with authority. What bleeds through when I read the Times \u2013 with important exceptions that keep the Times at the top of my must-read list despite its failings \u2013 is a deep kinship with the people who pull the key levers in our government and economy. As one former Times journalist once told me, the paper is the \"trade journal for the rich and powerful\".</p> <p>So, call me less than shocked at the discovery, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/08/nyt-reporter-gave-advance-copy-of-maureen-dowd-column-133479.html\">reported Tuesday by Politico</a>, that a Times reporter, Mark Mazzetti, gave the CIA an advance peek at an upcoming column by op-ed commentator Maureen Dowd. The Times has repeatedly allowed the Obama administration's national security operatives to vet upcoming journalism \u2013 the paper took public pride in <a href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=22378\">the way it redacted WikiLeaks material</a> at officials' behest \u2013 and it notoriously held a huge story (pervasive and illegal spying on Americans by the Bush administration) for a year. Still, it's hard to fathom why he or his editors would share a column by Dowd, whose commentary these days rarely contains any facts that haven't been previously reported.)</p> <p>The response of the Times' managing editor, Dean Baquet, was approximately this: \"Nothing to see here. Move along.\" Actually, it was worse. As Politico's reported (I've corrected a minor spelling error):</p> <blockquote> <p>\"'I know the circumstances, and if you knew everything that's going on, you'd know it's much ado about nothing,' Baquet said. 'I can't go into in detail. But I'm confident after talking to Mark that it's much ado about nothing.'</p> <p>\"'The optics aren't what they look like,' he went on. 'I've talked to Mark, I know the circumstance, and given what I know, it's much ado about nothing.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/28/times-reporter-shared-maureen-dowd-column-with-c-i-a-before-publication/\">The Times subsequently issued this statement</a>, which seemed to admit that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/oliver-burkemans-blog/2012/aug/28/why-2012-campaign-optics-dont-look-good\">the \"optics\"</a> were, in fact, more or less what they looked like:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Last August, Maureen Dowd asked Mark Mazzetti to help check a fact for her column. In the course of doing so, he sent the entire column to a CIA spokeswoman shortly before her deadline. He did this without the knowledge of Ms Dowd. This action was a mistake that is not consistent with New York Times standards.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That response has generated the derision it deserves. It's my fervent hope that the Times' incoming public editor starts her tenure by asking some extremely pointed questions. Given the Times' demands for transparency from others, its stonewalling on Mazzetti's dealings with the CIA transcends irony; it's downright hypocritical, and Baquet's blithe assurances were not credible.</p> <p>The Times isn't the only major organization with deep establishment ties to have allowed a subject of its coverage to vet that coverage before readers saw it. Media watchers were surprised to learn recently that the <a href=\"http://www.texasobserver.org/cover-story/washington-post-reporter-allows-college-officials-to-alter-story-on-controversial-test\">Washington Post had given the University of Texas an advance look</a> at a story draft by a higher education reporter.</p> <p>The Post and Times, meanwhile, are among many journalistic organizations to have allowed Obama administration and Romney campaign officials to vet quotes before publication. Baquet told his paper (kudos to the Times for actually running the story) that he didn't like the practice and that \"maybe we have to push back a little harder.\" You think?</p> <p>Journalists' dealings with sources prior to publication or broadcast are not binary, yes/no relationships. There's always some give-and-take, and sometimes, it raises ethical issues: for example, you will rarely, if ever, see a story in which a journalist treats his primary (often confidential) source as skeptically or harshly as others named in the piece.</p> <p>But handing a finished piece over? That is over the top.</p> <p>I don't know how much of this goes on in traditional media organizations. I do know that in my own years in the business, I wasn't party to any such practice. When I was a business and technology columnist in Silicon Valley, a decade-long stint that ended in 2005, I'd occasionally read a paragraph or two \u2013 typically, my translations of technical concepts into plain English \u2013 to someone I'd interviewed, to ensure that I was getting the details right. But sending a story or column in full? No way.</p> <p>For all that, I fully understand sources' wishes to see what's going to be said about them. Anyone who's ever been covered in a news story knows that errors creep in to even the best journalists' reports. Outright bad faith by reporters is exceedingly rare, in my experience, but absolute fidelity to what I know, as opposed to what is reported, is equally unusual.</p> <p>The best reason not to share reporting ahead of time is the most obvious. It makes your source a colleague or, at the very least, gives that appearance. If that's the intention, put another byline on the piece. Otherwise, don't be surprised when outsiders accuse you of compromising coziness with the people who, by tradition and the genuine national interest, should remain at arms' length.</p>",
  "<p>Complaints about unwanted marketing calls have trebled to almost 10,000 a month since the beginning of 2012 thanks to a huge surge in activity by PPI and accident claim firms.</p> <p>Telecoms watchdog Ofcom said that in July alone 9,803 complaints about unsolicited marketing calls were registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS), the official central opt-out register on which householders can record their preference not to receive such calls. This compares with 3,212 complaints in December 2011.</p> <p>\"The problem [with such calls] is a growing issue and can be partly attributed to an increase in the aggressive marketing practices of PPI and accident claims firms,\" said an Ofcom spokeswoman.</p> <p>The number of people who have complained to the telecoms watchdog about silent or abandoned calls has also trebled to more than 3,000 a month since the beginning of the year.</p> <p>Silent calls have become an increasing cause of nuisance and alarm, particularly for older people. They occur when automatic dialer systems used by call centres make more calls than they have people to take them. If there is no one available to take an answered call it is automatically dropped; the consumer will hear nothing before being cut off.</p> <p>Under Ofcom's rules the number of abandoned calls companies make to consumers each day is not allowed to exceed 3% of the total live calls made on that day.</p> <p>In January 2012 1,132 complaints about such calls were made to Ofcom, a figure little changed from six months earlier. However, since then complaints have rocketed, reaching 3,390 in July.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/apr/19/homeserve-fined-silent-calls\" title=\"\">In April Ofcom fined home insurance and repairs firm HomeServe</a> \u00a3750,000 for making excessive numbers of silent and abandoned calls.</p> <p>At the time Claudio Pollock, Ofcom's consumer director, said: \"We hope the fine will send a strong message to all companies that use call centres that they need to ensure they are fully compliant with the rules or face the consequences.\"</p> <p>The number of complaints suggests that the problem of silent calls is growing, although Ofcom attributes much of the rise to changes in the way it has collated its data over the last few months and a growing awareness by householders about how to complain.</p> <p>Ofcom can take enforcement action against companies making silent calls and is currently investigating two, npower and TalkTalk. Complaints about receiving abandoned and/or silent calls can be <a href=\"http://consumers.ofcom.org.uk/tell-us/telecoms/privacy/silent-call/\" title=\"\">registered on its website</a>.</p> <p>The Information Commissioner's Office is responsible for taking enforcement action where a company makes marketing calls to a person who is registered with the TPS and has not given prior consent to receive such calls.Consumers can complain directly to the ICO <a href=\"http://www.ico.gov.uk/complaints/privacy_and_electronic_communications.aspx\" title=\"\">on its website</a>.</p> <p>For a complaint to be recorded by the TPS, the person making the complaint must have been registered with it for at least 28 days.</p> <p>\"The real problem is that companies are prepared to break the law because the Information Commissioner's Office, which is responsible for enforcing the law, hasn't been flexing its muscles. As a result there's no real deterrent for wrong-doers,\" said a spokesman for the Direct Marketing Association, which runs the TPS.</p> <p>Jo Connell, chair of the Communications Consumer Panel, which highlights consumer issues to Ofcom, said the steep rise in the number of complaints to the TPS was of \"serious concern\".</p> <p>\"We encourage Ofcom, the Information Commissioner and TPS to strengthen their co-operative efforts and take action to reduce the incidence of unwanted calls,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>Bournemouth borough council has welcomed last weekend's restructuring of outsourcing specialist Mouchel which has led to the company being taken over by its bankers.</p> <p>Mouchel, whose other council customers include Milton Keynes, Lincolnshire, Oldham, and Bath &amp; NE Somerset councils, will be owned by MRBL, a newly incorporated company owned by Mouchel's lenders \u2013 RBS, Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays \u2013 together with the group's management after acquiring the businesses from Mouchel's administrator.</p> <p>Mouchel said the acquisition \"marks the completion of the group's financial restructuring and provides the business with a strong financial platform for the future.\"</p> <p>Councillor John Beesley, leader of Bournemouth borough council, said the deal secures a future for staff and services provided to the council.</p> <p>\"Of course, we continue to manage, monitor and review the contract closely, to ensure that service targets are being met within the agreed contract price, so guaranteeing ongoing savings to the council,\" he said. \"It essentially remains business as usual for our incremental partnership and our relationship with MRBL remains strong as they continue to deliver. Already, the partnership has created 85 jobs in the local economy, and an investment of \u00a37.71million into the Bournemouth contract.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>Grant Rumbles, chief executive of Mouchel, said: \"The completion of this restructuring means that the long-term future of this business is secure and the jobs of more than 8,000 people have been preserved. We now have the right capital structure to take Mouchel forward. For our clients and suppliers it is business as usual. With a stable and supportive ownership structure and a balance sheet that is fit for purpose, Mouchel will be in a strong position to rebuild the business and start winning large contracts again.\"</p> <p>Mouchel's financial worries have, however, left some of its key customers having to make critical decisions or alternative plans as the extent of the outsourcer's financial worries emerged, although the company has insisted its working relationship with those customers is \"business as usual\".</p> <p>Earlier this year, Bournemouth's cabinet agreed to ratify a previous decision to outsource the operation of the council's human resources &amp; organisational development and finance departments to Mouchel after considering a detailed independent risk assessment based on Mouchel's financial statements, along with an impartial review of the risk management and contract governance arrangements that are already in place.</p> <p>At the time, Councillor Beesley said, \"We are extending this contract having undertaken a great deal of background work.&#xa0;The independent reviews acknowledge that all the relevant issues have been fully faced and dealt with by the council, and that robust measures have been put in place to plan for a variety of risks, including a strong exit strategy in the event of needing to bring services back in house.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"The independent reviews have commended the council's governance and risk management processes relating to the incremental partnership.&#xa0; It is this comprehensive approach that has led to the council retaining \u00a3135,000 to cover the potential cost of bringing HR and finance back in house, should Mouchel fail, together with other significantly improved contractual measures which are commercially sensitive, to safeguard the council's position.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>Milton Keynes council, which had a 12-year, \u00a3200m contract with Mouchel said earlier this month that it would terminate the contract and would take most services and staff back in-house.</p> <p>It said Mouchel had successfully delivered operational and back office services but that the 12-year contract had been signed in 2004 since when the council faced \"a very different political and economic environment from when the contract was originally conceived\".</p> <p>Lincolnshire county council, which had a \u00a3490m, 16-year agreement signed in 1999, has begun a re-tender exercise, while Rochdale, which signed a 15-year, \u00a3200m contract in 2006 has shifted the contract to a subcontractor, Agilisys.

  "<p>My husband's driving, our children (Maddy, 6 and Jay, 10) are in the back, and I'm in the passenger seat, manning the stereo. Radio 4 and 5 Live have been vetoed, as Maddy claims that \"all that talking makes me feel sick\" \u2013 and while nobody's really convinced this is true, we're bucketing forwards in a metal box at good speed, and a backseat tantrum might be the last thing we hear before crashing and dying. So we've diplomatically decided to compromise and put a CD on. There's only one in the car that passes the Maddy test, and it's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Friday\" title=\"\">Nicki Minaj's Pink Friday</a>.</p> <p>Everyone knows Ms Minaj has a spectacularly dirty mouth. You might know that because she gave some of her Twitter followers the full <a href=\"http://www.metro.co.uk/music/909115-nicki-minaj-in-f-word-twitter-rant-after-cancelling-v-festival-2012-gig\" title=\"\">chew-you-up-and-spit-you-out treatment</a> when she was criticised for pulling out of V Festival with strained vocal cords earlier this month (sample hashtag aimed at the haters: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/237541552254246912\" title=\"\">\"#gofuckyourselves\"</a>). You might also know it because Pink Friday comes with a parental advisory sticker on the artwork, unless you had the foresight to pick up the clean version. I didn't need to be told, because I'd had <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzXDSWz3Nbw\" title=\"\">Did It On Em</a> (\"Man I just shitted on 'em/Put your number twos in the air if you did it on 'em\") on my iPod for more than a year. I cannot get enough of Minaj's super-nimble, super-aggressive, super-profane raps. And that is why I'm sitting in the front of the car, finger on the skip button and twitching like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parents_Music_Resource_Center\" title=\"\">Tipper Gore</a> in the grip of a seizure.</p> <p>There's a bit of swearing in the opener, but I let it fly. Then we're into the hard stuff with Roman's Revenge, which makes it up to \"I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cu \u2026\" before my index on censorship calls time. That means we dodge Eminem's contribution: \"Tied her arms and legs to the bed/Set up the camera and pissed on her twice/Two pees and a tripod!\" \u2013 which shocked me into splutters of laughter the first time I heard it, and can also be elaborately excused as not literally about a woman, but about a <a href=\"http://ohhla.com/anonymous/nicminaj/p_friday/romanrev.nic.txt\" title=\"\">female personification of life</a> (aha, clever as ever, Mathers), and which all the same I don't fancy explaining to my six-year-old, thanks anyway.</p> <p>Did It On Em is next, so we skip past that too, and by then I'm so inured to the cussing that the most objectionable thing remaining is will.i.am's appearance on the Buggles-sampling Check It Out. When we get to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtyebwVnZqs\" title=\"\">Girls Fall Like Dominoes</a> \u2013 in which Minaj celebrates the devotion of her female fans \u2013 the promise that \"If you're pretty / I sign titties\" sounds like a straight up declaration of girl power, though I'm still lucid enough to make a mental note: when Maddy goes back to school, fleece her for Sharpies. My daughter takes her friendships seriously, and if she's picked up the message that chest scrawling is a mark of girl-on-girl loyalty, I can look forward to some pretty awkward convos in the schoolyard.</p> <p>Minaj's ultra-stylised Harajuku Barbie look (high cleavage, poker-straight hair dyed pink, and immaculate pout) has a particular draw for small girls, as you can see from her <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2011/10/15/nicki-minaj-ellen-super-bass-sophia-grace-8-year-old/\" title=\"\">2011 appearance on Ellen</a>, with two British girls whose homebrew cover of Superbass became a YouTube hit. The amazed infants cling onto their heroine like delighted limpets, and Minaj seems completely at ease with them. No effs, no jeffs, just open arms and big smiles.</p> <p>I can tell my daughter is also besotted from the way that, at odd moments during the day, she'll hit me with a Minaj question: how old is Nicki? What colour is her hair really? Where does she buy her clothes? Maddy has joined the legion of Minaj-worshipping Barbz.

Still, it's something best done on your own, with headphones, rather than shared with your parents. Which is why my finger is firmly on the skip button for now, keeping Nicki (sort of) clean.</p>",

If convicted, he could face 15 years in prison.</p> <p>The indictment, which was unsealed on Tuesday, accuses Rivera and co-conspirators of stealing information from Sony Pictures Europe's computer systems in May and June 2011 using an SQL injection attack \u2013 which exploits flaws in the handing of data input for databases to take control of a system \u2013 against the studio's website.</p> <p>SQL injection, or SQLi, is an increasingly common technique used by hackers to break into systems.</p> <p>The indictment says Rivera then helped to post the confidential information onto LulzSec's website and announced the intrusion via the hacking group's Twitter account.</p> <p>While Rivera was the only person named in the indictment, the FBI said his co-conspirators included Cody Kretsinger, 24, a confessed LulzSec member who pleaded guilty in April to charges stemming from his role in the Sony attack.</p> <p>Yet the indictment and the arrest still leaves open one of the most puzzling questions left by the hacking spree seen in the first half of 2011, when the hacking collective Anonymous \u2013 and LulzSec, which grew out of it, were coming to public attention.</p> <p>That is the question of who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/apr/27/playstation-network-hack-sony\" title=\"\">hacked into Sony's PlayStation Network (PSN) system in April</a>.</p> <p>The attack, which may have leaked credit card details for millions of users, has never been traced to any group \u2013 although Sony suggested not long afterwards that Anonymous might have been involved.</p> <p>Since then it has given no further details about who it suspects of carrying out the attack, and no data from the attack has ever been posted publicly.</p> <p>By contrast the Sony Pictures Europe hack of which Rivera is accused saw the data leaked on 2 June, and LulzSec's activities are generally reckoned to have begun on 30 May with the posting of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/31/pbs-victim-hackers-wikileaks\" title=\"\">fake story about Tupac Shakur</a> to the PBS website.</p> <p>Following the Sony Pictures Europe breach, LulzSec published the names, birth dates, addresses, emails, phone numbers and passwords of thousands of people who had entered contests promoted by Sony, and publicly boasted of its exploits.</p> <p>\"From a single injection we accessed EVERYTHING,\" the hackers said in a statement at the time. \"Why do you put such faith in a company that allows itself to become open to these simple attacks?\"</p> <p>Authorities have said the Sony breach ultimately cost the company more than $600,000 (\u00a3378,000).</p> <p>LulzSec, an underground group also known as Lulz Security, is an offshoot of the international hacking collective Anonymous and took credit for attacks on a number of government and private sector websites, including the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency, the US Congressional website, and the Sun and News International sites.</p> <p>The latest indictment says Rivera is suspected of using a proxy server in a bid to conceal his IP address to avoid detection.</p> <p>Court documents revealed in March that a former Anonymous member known as Sabu, whose real name is Hector Xavier Monsegur, had pleaded guilty to hacking-related charges and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/06/lulzsec-sabu-working-for-us-fbi\" title=\"\">had been providing information on his cohorts to the FBI</a> since June 2011, after he was identified as he logged into a public bulletin board from his home address.</p> <p>That same month, five other suspected leaders of Anonymous, all them alleged to be LulzSec members as well, were charged by US authorities with computer hacking and other offences.</p> <p>A number of arrests followed in the UK, where six people have been charged with various offences linked to LulzSec's activities.</p> <p>An accused British hacker, Ryan Cleary, 20, was indicted by a US grand jury in June on charges related to LulzSec attacks on several media companies, including Sony Pictures.</p> <p>Kretsinger, who pleaded guilty to the same two charges now facing Rivera, is due to be sentenced on 25 October. A prosecutor said he was likely to receive substantially less than the 15-year maximum prison term carried by those offenses.</p> <p>Monsegur, 28, a Puerto Rican living in New York, has pleaded guilty to 12 charges, including three of conspiracy to hack into computers, five of hacking, one of hacking for fraudulent purposes, one of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, and one of aggravated identity theft.</p> <p>Those charges would attract a total of 124 years' jail, but it is thought he has arranged a plea bargain with the US government. Monsegur received a six-month reprieve from sentencing earlier in August in light of his cooperation with the government.</p> <p>Anonymous and its offshoots focused initially on fighting attempts at internet regulation and the blocking of free illegal downloads but have since taken aim at the Church of Scientology, global banking and other targets.</p> <p>Anonymous, and LulzSec in particular, became notorious in late 2010 when they launched what they called the first cyberwar in retaliation for attempts to shut down WikiLeaks.</p> <p>The rise of LulzSec saw a burst of similar \"crews\" aiming to hack sites, but since then Anonymous has focussed on providing an outlet for documents released by WikiLeaks.</p>",
  "<p>I tried cannabis once. I've never been keen on smoking or illicit drug use, but I was at a party and a bit drunk at the time, my inhibitions were lowered. Someone offered me a drag/toke/puff (delete as appropriate) on a joint/spliff/reefer (again, delete as appropriate), so I thought, why not? </p> <p>Why is 'why not?' always assumed to be a rhetorical question? I remember being unnerved by the feeling that I was slowly sinking into a chair, then laughed myself hoarse because I saw another friend walk through a door (said friend was gay, and he 'came out' of the other room... it seemed hilarious at the time). I ended the evening face down on the bathroom floor. I wasn't sick or anything, I just found the cool tiles immensely soothing, so stayed there for about 90 minutes.</p> <p>The above experience(s), coupled with the fact that I don't like feeling as if I've been breathing through a Volvo's exhaust pipe all night, meant that cannabis wasn't really for me. But that's not to say that I condemn others who indulge in it. Some of the smartest and most talented people I know are regular cannabis users, and have been for years.</p> <p>But this personal observation seemingly runs contrary to a new study recently published that suggests that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19372456\">young cannabis users run the risk of a lower IQ.</a> In what is an impressively long-term <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/news/Pages/Newsglossary.aspx\">cohort study</a>, it was found that \"those who started using cannabis below the age of 18 - while their brains were still developing - suffered a drop in IQ\". </p> <p>It does sound like an impressive study, and any study maintained over 2 decades deserves kudos for that alone. But as always, a news story written for the general public is going to leave out some important scientific points, as well as potentially raising some issues.</p> <p>Firstly, as is often said, <a href=\"http://xkcd.com/552/\">correlation does not imply causation.</a> Just because those who smoked cannabis as teenagers were recorded as having lower IQs, doesn't automatically mean that cannabis intake <em>causes</em> lower IQ. Measuring IQ is <a href=\"http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/04/what-does-iq-really-measure.html\">often a slippery subject</a>, let alone working out what sort of things affect it. For example, as bizarre as it may seem,<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Height_and_intelligence\"> height is apparently positively correlated with IQ</a>. That is, taller people seem to be more intelligent, according to IQ tests. Why is this? It's uncertain. You may think it's a bit contrived to use height as an example in a discussion about cannabis. But then, cannabis is typically smoked. And <a href=\"http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/15558/1/Does-Smoking-Stunt-Your-Growth.html\">what stunts your growth\u2026?</a></p> <p>Studies of large populations are tricky, it's practically impossible to rule out ALL variables that affect a typical human. Some<a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/325/7374/1199.full\"> large studies</a> have revealed a link between cannabis use and<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1369-1600.2008.00106.x/abstract;jsessionid=80CA4D87A6274A5CD7D9A875AC77E9F1.d03t03\"> psychiatric disorders</a> like<a href=\"http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/156/4/319.full\"> psychosis and schizophrenia. </a>It's still uncertain as to how this might occur. It's logical to assume that regular intake of mind-altering chemicals will alter your mind for the worse, eventually. But it may be possible that people prone to or suffering from these psychiatric disorders are <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12876543\">self-medicating</a>, using the effects of the drugs to alleviate the symptoms of the psychiatric illness. It becomes a question of what came first; the schizophrenic chicken or the constantly-stoned egg?</p> <p>The study is undoubtedly a good one and will produce a lot of interesting analysis and discussion for years to come. On the down side, it's likely that this finding has already been stripped of any meaningful scientific context by anti-drug campaigners and politicians looking to score easy points.</p> <p>Defending drugs is<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/oct/30/drugs-adviser-david-nutt-sacked\"> rarely a good move politically</a>, and anti-drug legislation often occurs <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7845023.stm\">without the support of scientific evidence</a>. Contrastingly, any scientific finding that suggests drug use may have detrimental effects is <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1541034/How-cannabis-use-causes-schizophrenia.html\">seized upon and often exaggerated,</a> sometimes to<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1541034/How-cannabis-use-causes-schizophrenia.html\"> ludicrous extents. </a>And you know there'll soon be leaflets going around schools that explicitly state that cannabis makes you stupid.</p> <p>Warning those at a vulnerable age about the potential dangers of drugs is, undoubtedly, a wise thing to do. But the way drugs are often<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl5gBJGnaXs\"> portrayed as nothing but harmful and damaging</a> is quite disconcerting; it suggests that taking drugs is akin to trying to increase the speed of your computer by pouring coffee over the motherboard; you're going to experience a lot of new sights, sounds and smells, but cause irreversible damage in the process.</p> <p>That's not how it works. Many drugs are effective because they work on systems in the brain that are already there. Opiates like heroin work on <a href=\"http://www.opiates.com/opiates/opiate-receptors.html\">opiate receptors</a>, cocaine affects the <a href=\"http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/i/i_03/i_03_m/i_03_m_par/i_03_m_par_cocaine.html\">dopamine system (amongst others)</a>. The brain and body have evolved over millions of years to recognise and utilise these chemicals, and drugs typically work because they are analogous to the substances that occur naturally in our bodies. E.g. cannabis works because the brain has <a href=\"http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_pharmacology2.shtml\">endogenous cannabinoids</a>. </p> <p>Our own internal, natural cannabinoids seem to have a variety of functions, from memory processing, pain relief to reproduction. The full extent and role of our cannabinoid system is still being researched, but one interesting theory I heard as a student is that cannabinoids are crucial for babies to survive the birthing process. Think about it. Cannabis relaxes you, relieves pain and gives you 'The Munchies' (an often amusing phenomenon, I once saw 5 stoned guys get through a crate of 20 year old army surplus tinned steak, which looked and smelled just like dog food, only somehow worse). When you're born, your universe has suddenly gone from a warm, dark sac to this bright airy void with these strange giant creatures fondling you. And you've just been bodily squeezed through a very narrow space. Also, you have to start eating on your own now, but you've never done that and haven't the cognitive or physical capacity to be instructed. This should be too traumatic an experience for a fragile human to endure, unless they were flooded with a chemical which makes you chilled out, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2430692/\">limits pain</a> and makes you want to eat copiously without knowing why.</p> <p>An interesting theory, and one that produces an amusing contradiction in that cannabis is supposedly dangerous for under-18s but crucial for new-borns. But although there is some data to suggest that cannabinoids are<a href=\"http://ebm.rsmjournals.com/content/230/4/225.short\"> important for</a> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1721976/pdf/v090p0F540a.pdf\">babies</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166223699014915\">development</a>, I can't find any mention of the 'crucial for the birth process' theory anywhere.</p> <p>Maybe I should keep looking, but thinking back, it does have the weird-but-logical quality of the sort of idea someone with neurological knowledge would come up with while, ironically, severely stoned. Maybe I came up with it myself at that party?</p> <p>It's important to keep in mind the scientific context of drug use. Many drugs can be damaging, but then, the majority of recreational drugs were introduced for their <a href=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/874104-overview\">medical applications</a>. It's not always a clearcut case of \"drugs = bad thing\", there are numerous other variables to consider. And taking drugs isn't like throwing a wrench into the workings of the brain, but more like adjusting the settings of it. This can be just as damaging in many cases, but it's not a simple black-and-white matter as is often implied. Telling teenagers that drugs will definitely damage could backfire if they take them anyway and find out that this isn't the case. As I<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/brain-flapping/2012/aug/22/gcse-results-exams-easier-impact\"> mentioned previously</a>, it's unwise to patronise teenagers in this way, they recognise when they're being screwed over. They're not stupid.</p> <p>That is, apparently, unless they regularly smoke cannabis. But in that case, your anti-drug message has clearly already failed, so you might as well move on.</p> <p><em>Dean Burnett's own all-natural intellectual decline can be witnessed via his twitter account: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garwboy\">@garwboy</a><br></em></p>",

It is not known how many had been given the necessary visas by the UKBA before suspension. There have been no visas issued to such students, nor applications considered, since the suspension was announced.</p> <p>Existing international students are also calling a university hotline for news and advice. The university accuses the UKBA of seeming to be \"unwilling to communicate\" and \"threatening the future of our students, staff and \u2026 the mission of the university.\"</p> <p>The Home Office says students who have already been given a visa on the basis of an acceptance of a place awarded by the university before its suspension, but who have not yet travelled to take that place up, will be allowed to enter the UK and start studying.</p> <p>However its <a href=\"http:///www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/employersandsponsors/pbsguidance/guidancefrom31mar09/sponsor-guidance-t4-060412.pdf?view=Binary\" title=\"\">policy guidance to universities</a> also states: \"We do advise students to check the status of their sponsor's licence before they travel and not to travel to the UK if their sponsor's licence has been suspended.\"</p> <p>If the licence is revoked entirely, any students not involved in the failures around monitoring their status will be allowed to remain in the UK and given 60 days to find a new sponsor, \"regularise their stay\" or leave the UK.

  "<p>In search of wisdom I checked the flood of online posts below <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/aug/28/nick-clegg-emergency-tax-britains-weathiest\" title=\"\">Nick Watt's interview with Nick Clegg in today's Guardian</a>, in which the DPM and \u2013 more relevant here \u2013 Lib Dem leader suggests that Britain's richest should pay a temporary wealth tax to help ease the country's economic plight.</p> <p>Alas, it would have been more instructive to walk around the wealthiest districts of London at night. I'll come back to that. Online, most early posts got no further than those along the lines of \"dead man walking\", \"too late\" and \"you're toast, mate\". It may all be true about Clegg's prospects, though it's still too soon to be sure. But it's not very illuminating, is it?</p> <p>We can see the merit of what Clegg is trying to say, that those with the broadest shoulders should bear the biggest tax burden and plenty of countries have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_tax\" title=\"\">wealth taxes</a>. It might help prevent further cuts in the welfare state, which damage the social fabric as well as individual and family lives \u2013 what George Osborne has in store for us as the recovery falters, though I have always doubted he'll be able to do it.</p> <p>Will Clegg be able to do it? Politics is about practicality, about actually doing things and making them stick, not about high-blown rhetoric or posturing of which we get far too much \u2013 and always have. And he's not alone in looking at taxation of wealth.</p> <p>Tim Montgomerie, the mastermind behind the Lord Ashcroft-owned ConservativeHome website, has made himself plenty of Tory enemies (not just Ashcroft?) by backing a shift from taxes on income and wealth creation to wealth itself, notably property. Check out <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2012/08/tories-should-support-more-property-taxes-if-proceeds-are-used-to-cut-other-more-harmful-taxes.html\" title=\"\">his constructive response to Clegg</a>. It's an interesting read.</p> <p>Tricky stuff, eh? Montgomerie's ideas for increasing the too-flat council tax band scale and hitting property sales harder would also help the north-south unfairness divide, he adds. The Tories need to do better in the north, but it's not easy to see the coalition doing it. Montgomerie can be naive in a wholesome way.</p> <p>But practicality goes for the chancellor as much as it does for blogger Tim or the DPM. Osborne may see himself as the hard-nosed realist, despising Clegg as a hand-wringing wet. He may be right about the personal judgment, but he's been wrong from day one to assume that the UK economy will grow again with his austerity medicine. Not much realism about that.</p> <p>And without growth the medicine won't work. Those who say \"ah, we must administer even more medicine\" are engaged in bogus machismo, as dumb in their own way as panacea-merchants who say \"nationalise everything\" or \"leave the EU and all will be well again\".</p> <p>Clegg and Vince Cable are right about that too. There's plenty that the coalition can do to rearrange public spending, making it work better for all without further depressing demand in the economy. Building infrastructure projects, houses, power stations and third runways, instead of spending the same money on unemployment benefit is only part of it. Public spending is needed to stimulate the private kind. Everyone knows that except those Tory \"realists\". In their attack on Clegg today the <a href=\"http://www.taxpayersalliance.com/\" title=\"\">TaxPayers' Alliance</a> shows how not to do it.</p> <p>But how to lift flagging tax revenues and reinforce a greater \"we're all in this together\" sense of fairness, which is so important to social cohesion? That's much harder and Clegg was conspicuously vague about his proposed wealth tax in his interview, in which our Nick detected <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/aug/28/nick-clegg-thorny-path-out-of-rose-garden\" title=\"\">a new sense of self-confidence</a> in the other Nick after his long coalition battering. David Cameron's rebuff on Lords reform (with Ed Miliband's collusion, he feels) may have put iron into Clegg's soul.</p> <p>He promises details at his party conference. Don't hold too much breath. Those respectable UK-domiciled wealthy earners and taxpayers already pay most of the income tax collected in this country, though tax avoiders (legal) and evaders (illegal), non-domiciles and other shifty types who use our roads and are protected by our laws do not. The top tax rate has been raised (and lowered) to 45% and assorted allowances \u2013 pensions for instance \u2013 curbed. Bonus culture is under pressure. Deutsche Bank <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/feedarticle/10409622\" title=\"New bonus rules\">ended it only last week</a>. Bob Diamond has gone home to New York.</p> <p>So there has been progress. Amid a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/aug/29/nick-clegg-wealth-tax-envy\" title=\"\">hail of weary abuse about \"the politics of envy\"</a> (as tired slogans go \"the culture of greed\" still works better in 2012, I feel) and \"killing of enterprise\", Clegg wants to levy a tax on wealth, not income. That's fair enough in theory, but harder in practice. As the BBC's Nick Robinson was quick to point out, an elderly widow living in the family home may have wealth locked up in the property, but no spare income to pay an annual wealth tax.</p> <p>Such people tend to be Tory voters. Some are even Lib Dems (Labour, SNP etc too) as Cable discovered when he launched his unilateral \"mansion tax\" plan at the party's conference in Bournemouth, barely a cab ride from Sandbanks, the Poole suburb with (it is claimed) the richest postcode in Britain. Cable's target of a levy on \u00a31m homes captured too many middling earners and rapidly became \u00a32m before the Tories blocked it - Nick Robinson <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19408390\" title=\"\">confirms the point</a>.</p> <h2>Uphill work</h2> <p>Property is always said to be easier to tax because you can't hide it in Jersey or Zurich. Alas, Osborne is only the latest chancellor to find that isn't quite true any more. A Russian oligarch who puts his Mayfair house into the ownership of an offshore company and then sells the company to another company avoids stamp duty as the house itself has not been sold. The Treasury is trying to close such loopholes, but it's always uphill work.</p> <p>As Wikipedia's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_tax\" title=\"\">modest summary points out</a>, a wealth tax is levied on net assets in several countries \u2013 including Norway and, exclusively in the EU, France. Germany is among those to have recently abolished an annual levy on net worth, property as well as more liquid assets.</p> <p>I'm not sure that US state and federal property taxes or UK council tax (which replaced the rates) are really wealth taxes. They are tied to property values though, albeit values which are usually well out of date, and they do deliver some of the same rough justice, taxing people who are cash-poor such as widows in the family house or flat.</p> <p>As our near and comparable neighbour, France and its <a href=\"http://www.connexionfrance.com/wealth-tax-france-explained-impot-de-solidarite-sur-la-fortune-isf-10573-news-article.html\" title=\"\">\"solidarity tax\"</a> is the interesting case, as is Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's stance on tightening of the screw. It's complicated, it always is, but uncomplicated is the French republican loathing of great wealth. It's what turned voters off Nicolas Sarkozy, champion of bling and the bling crowd.</p> <p>The solidarity tax (ISF) is reckoned to raise up to \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.2bn) a year , not much but it's supposed to make other taxpayers feel better. Or should it? Some tax buffs claim it has driven far more wealth out of France over the years \u2013 hence the joke that ISF stands for <em>incitement de sortir de france</em>. Is that true \u2013 or just bluff, like all those city types who keep telling the FT that they will decamp to Dublin, Singapore or Zurich but rarely do?</p> <p>Here's where finesse is required. The very rich are mobile and in many cases their loyalty is to their money. Hence my advice to tour the rich neighbourhoods of London at night. Like the Grand Canal in Venice \u2013 so glorious in sunlight \u2013 they present a sad spectacle because so few lights are on in Mayfair or Belgravia. The owners are not there. They're somewhere else wasting their money on foolish things to keep boredom and death at bay.</p> <p>Not all rich people are foolish, any more than poor people are. They know the value of family, place, community and more than pay their way via their taxes, their commitment, their charity. Think Bill Gates, think Warren Buffett. Nearer to home think the Rowntrees or the Sainsburys. So do remember that Fred \"the Shred\" Goodwin \u2013 that's Mr Goodwin to you \u2013 is not the only type of banker or plutocrat out there.</p> <p>So Clegg needs to refine his ideas cautiously and play down expectations that arouse the party faithful but alarm the unpatriotic rich. Small practical measures may make for feebler headlines but will divide society less and should end up producing more tax revenue \u2013 which is the prime purpose of the exercise, not phoney feel-good.</p> <p>Invest more money in HMRC staff (they've been cutting them back) especially the special units which tackle avoidance and fraud. By all means close more tax loopholes and hammer loophole merchants harder. Do create some higher property bands for council tax, which now hits middle income families hardest and urge a revaluation of property values. That's a form of wealth tax which most Americans, the sane ones, accept.</p> <p>Don't give in to the temptation of easy conference applause, Nick, and demand that Dave and George raise the top income tax rate to 50% again. You voted for the cut to 45% with a bad conscience under duress, but vote you did. We don't want to drive away the rich, because we need their taxes. We do, however, want to make their role less central to the way we conduct our society.</p> <p>If you really do want to make the tax system fairer so that those who won't miss it pay more, go for small but effective changes, enforced with greater determination. If all you want to do is get through a difficult party conference season, bellow away to your heart's content. But voters nowadays believe what you <em>do</em>, not what you merely <em>say</em>.</p>",
  "<p>The first thing you should know about me is I have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia\">dyslexia</a> and I have never been shy about it. So please excuse any mistakes that may be found in the following blog (although spell checker is a saviour). The second thing you should know is that I recently graduated and obtained a PGCE. Something that at many points during the year-long course I did not think was possible.</p> <p>So where do I start? Although the PGCE is only one year long, it can at times feel like a decade. Anyone thinking of doing it should know this. The PGCE is hard. If you have done it, or know someone who has, they can confirm this. There are long nights when getting to bed before one in the morning seem like an illusion, where putting on makeup and heels and socialising were something that only others did. There are times when your house mates will forget what you look like because your face is buried into a laptop and lesson resources, and they only know you're home because you're rounding up yoghurt pots and milk cartons for the creative area. However, the light is, by your second placement things get easier, you create your methods and time scales.</p> <p>So, some background information on me, before I hand out advice. I'm 23, live in Wales, and think anyone who trained to teach at secondary school is brave, really brave. I was diagnosed with dyslexia in the first year of secondary school which, luckily for me, has meant that I have had 12 years of finding ways to amend an aspect of my life to make it easier. As I write this blog post, my page colour has a purple tint, the paper I will print it out on will be yellow, as are all draft copies of work I have written. I have people who will proof read work for me, these people are amazing. They don't work for the university or get paid, they are simply my family and friends who have watched me struggle to spell simple words (simple being one of them) and who have offered their brains to help. These people are precious.</p> <p>Although I was lucky to be diagnosed with dyslexia at 11, the years I spent in primary school were awful, being made to stand up and spell words and those who spelt them right were the first to leave and go home at the end of the day. Sounds like something out of a Victorian history book, right? But no, unfortunately this is a memory I hold, and one I would never ever as a teacher wish to create for any other student.</p> <p>Being dyslexic, as with many things, made the PGCE even harder, but this was not the only factor that made it hard. There were demoralizing moments, at some point I was even asked in a roundabout way, by someone meant to be seen as an mentor, if I thought I could teach children when I could not spell myself. This is naive. Dyslexia effects way more than your ability to spell. It affects organisation, timing, reading and in some cases balance. But why should a disability like that stop someone achieving their dream? </p> <p>There is a dyslexic centre to go to for help. However, some students, like myself, were placed around hour away from their homes with only public transport to rely on (carrying a puppet theatre on the bus can result in some funny looks) and the support centre was often closed by the time I could get there. Lack of communication between the university and placement school resulted in lots of extra unnecessary written work, something that I would then be penalised on for my spelling mistakes or grammatical errors, affecting my reviews.</p> <p>As I mentioned before, I have never been shy about admitting I have dyslexia, I know that some people can be, but I believe that sharing this with people helps me, it allows them to ask questions and, in turn, allows me to answer them. </p> <p>So here are my top tips for being dyslexic and going into teaching:</p> <p>\u2022 Planning: The PGCE comes with a lot of planning and planning documents. Some of these you will not be able to amend because of school policies, some however you will. Find out which ones you can change. I changed one simply by rearranging the questions, and the new layout meant I could read it much easier.</p> <p>\u2022 Another document you will need to complete is a pupil tracker. This had space to write how every child was responding to your teaching, so 28 children to write about on one piece of A4. I changed it to one page for each group in my class, this made it much easier to look at.</p> <p>\u2022 During lectures don't be afraid to ask to have the PowerPoints amended to suit you. This may be forgotten by lecturers, it was many times for me. Remind them, they're busy. You cannot learn if you cannot read.</p> <p>\u2022 Ask your school if you can print in colour, if that's what helps you, or if they have a printer where you can print on coloured paper. Schools are surprisingly co-operative and you may find fellow dyslexics appear.</p> <p>\u2022 Keep an eye on your school experience file. Organise it immediately. Sit and think about how it would best work for you, build it up and take it to your link tutor, show them and explain why it is organised as it is. When you arrive at school do the same, show you mentor and senior mentor why you have it like this, it will help with file checks.</p> <p>\u2022 Copy and paste: Find a copy of the framework online and copy/paste the skills you'll be using, this is not cheating and by typing you could make a mistake.</p> <p>\u2022 Inevitably you will fall behind on work, so have a blank copy of every planning sheet in your file so you can quickly jot down by hand what's happening, this will prove useful for file inspections.</p> <p>\u2022 Colour coding: This may be just me but I colour code everything. My weekly timetable and my resource file, co-operated together. Maths time blue, maths resources under the blue sections. I could see what was happening without having to read it.</p> <p>\u2022 Open a <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/\">Facebook</a> group and use a <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/\">Dropbox</a> file for your PGCE class. These resources and notes shared here will be useful even after graduating. A fantastic way to keep friends too. </p> <p>One thing that confused me about the PGCE was while on my second placement my grades rose from mainly twos (very good) to all ones (excellent). These reviews were based on the way I conduct a lesson and on the way that the children listened, yet when I wrote an academic piece of work I failed, risking my qualification actually being achieved. How can it be if someone can write a fantastic piece of work, but teach at a level three could pass a course over someone with a disability who teaches, according to an assessor, excellent lessons? It was moments like this that made me want to quit the course and lose faith in my ability to teach, but when I returned to the class on a Monday and saw the children had brought in something from home to do with our lessons or remembered something from my lessons, my faith was restored. </p> <p>Being a teacher is not only about my spelling, reading or academic levels, it's about passion, influence and seeing your hard work and late nights being transferred to all those children that trust you when you stand in front of them or sit beside them and teach them five days a week.</p> <p><em>Jadie Hurrell trained as a primary school teacher and lives in North Wales.

  "<p>Many people point to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/jan/30/uk-univeristy-applications-fall\" title=\"\">the fall in 2012/13 applications to English universities</a> as evidence that students have been put off applying because of the near trebling of tuition fees. In theory, however, no-one should be put off by this change. Fees will now be deferred and paid back gradually after university, once a graduate is earning a good wage. And there are generous maintenance loans and grants on offer, meaning everyone, regardless of background, should be able to afford upfront to go to university.</p> <p>But how many potential students actually understand this new payment structure? So far there is little evidence of whether young people making important decisions about university actually understand how much it costs, how and when they have to pay, and crucially, whether the financial benefits outweigh the costs.</p> <p>A team of researchers at the LSE, led by Professor Sandra McNally, undertook <a href=\"http://cee.lse.ac.uk/pubs/default.asp\" title=\"\">a study</a> aiming to find out what school pupils know about the costs and benefits of going to university and the potential impact on their knowledge and aspirations of an 'information campaign'. Our study took place in the 2010-11 academic year with 54 participating London schools. In each school, we surveyed all year 10 pupils (14-15 year olds) \u2013 around 12,000 took part in total.</p> <p>An initial survey questioned pupils about their knowledge of the costs and benefits of higher education, after which some schools were given an information package, including access to <a href=\"http://www.whats4.me.uk\" title=\"\">a website</a>, leaflets, a video and a presentation about staying in education. Other schools were given the package only eight to 12 weeks later, after all participants had completed a second survey. Both surveys took place at the time when the increase in tuition fees was announced. Results therefore reflect not only the impact of the information campaign but also the short-term impact of media reporting of the fee increase.</p> <p>The survey revealed large gaps in pupil knowledge about the costs and benefits of higher education. For example, less than half of pupils knew that fees are paid after university, and once they have a job, while fewer than half regarded student loans as a \"cheaper/better way to borrow money than other types of borrowing\". Furthermore, around a quarter of pupils held the view that going to university was \"too expensive\".</p> <p>Media reporting around the time of the fees hike improved pupils' knowledge of how much university would cost but also increased the negative perceptions of affordability, with a significant increase in the proportion who thought university was too expensive. This increase was greater among pupils from comprehensive schools compared with those from independent schools.</p> <p>Results also suggested that misperceptions over the costs and impact of the fee increase can be easily corrected with an information campaign. Pupil attitudes changed considerably in response to the information package, which stressed the availability of grants and how loans can be repaid rather than focusing on the fee increase per se. As well as improving student knowledge about the benefits of higher education \u2013 something lacking in the media focus \u2013 the campaign significantly reduced negative perceptions of affordability across the board.</p> <p>Previous research has shown that factors determining whether pupils go on to university are largely set before they finish their compulsory education at the end of Year 11. We should not be waiting until exams have been sat and subject choices made before ensuring that pupils have the correct information on which to base their future decisions. Nor does the fact that careers information classes are not specifically resourced or required by government help create the right incentives for schools to raise their game.</p> <p><em>Gill Wyness is an education researcher at LSE and research associate of the liberal think tank </em><a href=\"http://www.centreforum.org/\" title=\"\"><em>CentreForum</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Chinese lawyers have raised the alarm over plans that would allow judges to disbar them for up to a year for \"disrupting the order\" of hearings.</p> <p>Experts say it is the latest in a series of attempts to rein in advocates and, if implemented, would further limit their ability to effectively represent clients. Lawyers fear they could also face punishment for publicising problematic trials.</p> <p>\"It will give lawyers a lot of pressure,\" warned one, Mo Shaoping, who has taken on numerous sensitive cases.</p> <p>\"It fits into a pattern of trying to use the law and regulations like this to tame lawyers,\" said Joshua Rosenzweig, an independent rights scholar based in Hong Kong. \"'Court order' can potentially become whatever [judges] say it is.\"</p> <p>There is particular concern that the draft proposal before the supreme people's court seeks to constrain publicity, preventing lawyers from microblogging and emailing about hearings without permission.</p> <p>Rosenzweig said the clause appeared to refer to real-time reporting from the courtroom. But the wording is ambiguous and many fear it could be used to punish broader discussion.</p> <p>Liu Xiaoyuan, another high-profile lawyer, described it as a \"straitjacket\".</p> <p>\"Some judges are not very high quality. They might say something illegal in court and they're afraid if lawyers post the details on a microblog it would have a negative impact,\" he added.</p> <p>In one high-profile case, in Guizhou, a court cut the sentence for a gang leader by four years after his defence team broadcast parts of the trial online and challenged improper legal procedures.</p> <p>Earlier this year, a vice president of the supreme people's court complained the public were quick to believe \"ill-intentioned lawyers\" who accused courts of wrongdoing.</p> <p>Pu Zhiqiang, another well-known lawyer, said the \"idiotic\" measure would be the shame of the Chinese legal system if approved.</p> <p>\"This proposal is targeting human rights lawyers,\" he said.</p> <p>\"When justice is not respected in court, some people will appeal to public opinion. This proposal shows the fear judicial departments have of public trials.\"</p> <p>Nicholas Bequelin, senior Asia researcher at <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/\" title=\"\">Human Rights Watch</a>, said: \"Lawyers are alarmed because they know every regulation is broadly interpreted by authorities.</p> <p>\"The government has repeatedly clipped the wings of the legal profession in recent years\u2026 It's really a step back in the way that justice is delivered in China.\"</p> <p>He said the families of defendants were often unaware of their rights or under intense pressure to remain silent.</p> <p>Lawyers say the changes are unnecessary because judges can already punish misconduct in court and ask other authorities to consider the suspension or removal of their licences.</p> <p>The supreme people's court did not reply to faxed queries.</p>",
  "<p>Once again it's ended in an England eulogy, just as it always seems to whenever Graeme Smith, Ursa Major, is in town: first the hitherto mentally indestructible Nasser Hussain; next the slick, fertile mind of Michael Vaughan; both gone in the red-eyed lachrymosity of resignation. And now follows the aristocratic Andrew Strauss, Lord Brocket, although there was a little more \"stiff-upper-lippery\" about his Lord's valediction.</p> <p>Perhaps the runes have been there to be read for some time. He has been to the brink before but that was strictly to do with his batting. His captaincy, though, not just his on-field presence but his total leadership, was beyond question for those he led. If there was a lack of intuition or instinctiveness about his tactics \u2013 an overall pragmatism \u2013 then it has to be remembered that captaincy is executive but also consultative; a unilateral, autocratic captain is usually a poor one.</p> <p>But beyond the field of play, he maintained total control, his relationship with Andy Flower as complete as had been those of Hussain and Vaughan with Flower's predecessor, Duncan Fletcher. He was not just the safe choice to help clean up the mess left by the Kevin Pietersen-Peter Moores fiasco, he was the only choice. Through it, from the watershed clear-the-air team meeting in the immediate Jamaican aftermath of the humiliating 51 all out innings defeat in his first match as official captain in February 2009, he gained the unequivocal respect of all his players, something he was not to lose until, it seems, recently.</p> <p>Yet, having driven England to the top of the Test rankings and momentously winning Ashes series home and away, the benchmark by which all England captains are judged no matter the view elsewhere, the team began to falter, first in the Emirates at the start of the year, and now against an excellent South Africa side against whom it was no disgrace to lose.</p> <p>His own batting form suffered, for although there were two redemptive centuries against West Indies this summer, they perhaps papered over the cracks that had appeared in a remarkably resilient mentality. If he had become a much more versatile batsman than in his formative international years, then his repeated failure to convert decent starts into hundreds as he once did so voraciously was telling. The more this happened, the more it must have compounded. Just maybe he was coming to the end of the line as an international batsman in any case.</p> <p>Now we have to wonder at the full extent of the effect on his mind and the team dynamic that the recent events involving Pietersen have had. That Pietersen has lost respect for Strauss is obvious, and in that he is probably alone in the England team, with the feeling reciprocated. Also not in doubt, however, is the draining effect that a single high-maintenance, mega-talented individual has had, from doubts about his own batting, over a considerable period, and the inevitable fallout from his own sacking as captain, to the current disaffection as a result of his bewilderingly ever-changing agenda. The text messaging is no more than a final straw, if, as it is proving, the catalyst for change. Pietersen alone will not have driven Strauss away but will have contributed heavily.</p> <p>Whether Strauss's departure makes a return for Pietersen more likely is hard to gauge, but a guess would be that it will not. The new captain, Alastair Cook, might be keen on a fresh start but his team surely would close ranks and Pietersen would become a total outsider. However, in going now, Strauss has left the way uncluttered for Cook and Flower to begin the process of regeneration. Had Strauss gone to India, the outcome might have muddied the water, unless he both won and succeeded personally. Anything else would result in ambivalence.</p> <p>Now there are nine Test matches before the Ashes double-header for Cook to bed in as leader and for a new opening partnership to form. When, in 2006, Fletcher, ill-advisedly as it transpired, appointed Andrew Flintoff over Strauss to lead in Australia, my young daughter, in her innocence, told me that \"the man who isn't Fred must be very sad\". He had no need to be. Not leading that team was quite possibly the making of him. Sad he may be now but he took the England team to the heights, and for that we can all be grateful.</p>",
  "<p>Outside observers have noted the recent barrage of statements and facts that have repeatedly reminded interested parties that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/23/republicans-women-simply-sum-parts\">the GOP has a female problem</a>. These pricks of conscience have been an almost daily disturbance to the message discipline of the Republican National Convention. Todd Akin may have teed up the subject more precisely than most, but the ball was rolling back in May, when polls showed an astounding 20-point gender gap between Obama and Romney. Since Akin misspoke himself into a soundbite, we've seen things that seem to explain that gap.</p> <p>There was the party's decision to ratify the policy that Akin was championing when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/20/todd-akin-christian-abortion-rape\">he introduced the idea of \"legitimate rape\"</a>: the Republican party platform, designated to be formally adopted Tuesday, calls for outlawing <em>all</em> abortions, with no exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest or if the pregnancy puts the life of the mother at risk.</p> <p>The selection of Paul Ryan as the party's vice-presidential nominee highlighted a more immediately relevant view: in Congress, Ryan voted to support banning federal funding to any clinic that performs abortions and denying payment for abortions via federal insurance voucher or Medicaid. This seems a less extreme position, allowing at least a woman with the means to do so control over her reproductive organs. You see just how radical the legislation really was only if you consider its articulated exceptions for federal funding of abortions: first of all, for those \"forcible rapes\" that so excited Akin's imagination, and second, for incest survivors \u2013 if the pregnant woman in question is still a minor. Over 18 and pregnant by a relative? What, your uterus didn't know?</p> <p>And then, there's serial hatchet man and noted genealogist Donald Trump. Tuesday morning, he unleashed an unprovoked attack on internet publisher Arianna Huffington: she \"is unattractive both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man \u2013 he made a good decision.\"</p> <p>All things considered, I think marriage equality advocates would rather not have Trump on their side.</p> <p>Which brings us to the unlikely allies at question: women and the Republican party. Right?</p> <p>The kind of people who notice the things that have happened in the last week are the kind of people who have trouble understanding conservative women's loyalty. Why would women support candidates who ally themselves with misogynists such as Trump? Why don't they do something to change the minds of the men who assert a difference between rape and \"forcible rape\", and judge the trauma of incest to be less if you happen to be old enough to vote?</p> <p>Why isn't there open revolt here in Tampa: perfectly-coiffed ladies burning their <a href=\"http://www.spanx.com/home/index.jsp\">Spanx</a> and shouting down the men who want to decide their futures for them?</p> <p>To call them all radical pro-lifers would explain their priorities, but the numbers just don't back up that hypothesis. Polling done just this month <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/24/cnn-poll-did-akin-comments-have-public-opinion-impact/\">shows fully 76%</a> of Republicans (men and women) at odds with their party's official stance, believing that abortion should be legal in certain situations. So, then it's tempting to write off Republican women as perhaps just \"not knowing\" something \u2013 most significantly, their party's official position, but maybe also the impact of such policies. But is that an explanation or just condescension?</p> <p>More equitably, maybe they're secretly conflicted \u2013 or, in the case such lawmakers as Olympia Snowe, not-so-secretly conflicted \u2013 aware of the perceived trade-off between \"economic liberty\" and civil liberties, and simply willing to compromise. Some form of that compromise is probably the most accurate explanation. Women I talk to here literally roll their eyes at any line of questioning that begins, \"So, as a woman \u2026 ?\"</p> <p>Kim Ferguson, a Massachusetts delegate and state representative, articulated what she's seen, as a self-described moderate and elected official, when it comes to women's issues. Her constituents, she says, \"don't want to talk about that\":</p> <blockquote> <p>\"They want to talk about the fiscal train wreck we're in. Even if I raise it, they'll say something \u2013 but qualify it by saying, 'But that's not what I want to talk about.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And when it comes to the issue that's flared so brightly in the past week, the numbers bear out anecdotal observation: only 34% of those polled (and 38% of women polled) say they couldn't vote for a candidate who differed with them on abortion rights. </p> <p>I have come to believe that, at the very least, there's a strong connection between reproductive rights and women's economic progress. But I've also come to believe that the connections intertwining a woman's life, her body and her child are so deep and ultimately mysterious that I'm no longer sure whether, if I was faced with an unwanted pregnancy of any kind, I could be able to make the distinction between \u2013 as Paul Ryan maladroitly put it \u2013 \"methods of conception\". If life is life, and I feel that connection within me, could I give myself the choice I am so sure other women should have?</p> <p>Reproductive policy doesn't actually lend itself to the binary answers available in polls. My one attempt to question a \"typical\" female delegate on the issue (I asked the first woman I saw) ended in an extended philosophical discussion with Sherry Wright, a black <a href=\"http://negop.org/state-convention/\">Republican alternate delegate from Nebraska</a>, who dodged my question with disarming earnestness. Yes, she was aware of the party's platform. Yes, she believed life begins at conception. But if another woman chooses to get an abortion? \"I am not going to condemn you.\"</p> <p>In fact, though she repeatedly insisted \"I'm not for abortion,\" she also said, \"I wouldn't want <em>you</em> to make that decision for <em>me</em>.\" She didn't know how she'd react if a family member had to face pregnancy in the wake of a rape, but \"I'd probably abide by <em>her</em> decision.\"</p> <p>When we followed the logic of a \"consistent\" pro-life position (making abortion illegal without exception), we wound up in a theological and moral rabbit hole, talking about artificial insemination, adoption, and the human desire to know whose blood flows through one's veins.</p> <p>Wright was unconcerned that the simplicity of her party's official position was at odds with the complexity that kept us in conversation for half an hour. \"I'm for everyone having their voice,\" she said. \"People try to change the platform\" on kinds of issues, she said. \"It usually doesn't happen.\" (This is true: the \"no exceptions\" ban has been in place since 1980.)</p> <p>In the end, Wright had to get to the business of being a delegate. I thanked her for her time and admitted that I am usually more reticent in interviews with conservatives, if I do them at all. I know I'm considered the enemy. She laughed and gave me advice that might explain everything.</p> <p>\"Eventually, you'll find someone to talk to,\" she said. \"Just act like you belong.\"</p>",
  "<p>The male mid-life crisis is a stage staple, yet the word menopause is barely whispered in the theatre \u2013 making April de Angelis's smart comedy a rare exception. At the heart of this tragedy played as farce is Hilary (Tamsin Greig), a woman struggling with a number of things \u2013 turning 50, a stale marriage to Mark (Ewan Stewart), the loss of her job due to government cuts, and, not least, her daughter Tilly (Bel Powley), a 15-year-old of such sexual provocativeness and sneering contempt that she's a walking advertisement for the old adage that teenagers are God's punishment for having sex.</p> <p>From the moment that Greig, arms weighed down by carrier bags, staggers into her kitchen (in Lizzie Clachan's design, a place of muted greys, as if all the colour had been bleached out of it), and gropes for the wine before even removing her coat, it is clear this is a woman in retreat. So where did it all go wrong?</p> <p>De Angelis's play comes draped in cheeky comedy, but at its heart is about loss: loss of principles (Hilary was once at <a href=\"http://www.greenham-common.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Greenham Common</a>), loss of self in the role of motherhood, loss of love, loss of control over a child. Most of all \u2013 though the subject is only glancingly explored, as if De Angelis is afraid the f-word might frighten the audience \u2013 it is about losing ground gained by the feminists of the 1980s.</p> <p>Just as Hilary finds it difficult to face the hard reality of a life gone astray, so De Angelis touches something truthful about the lives of a generation of women who thought they would lead entirely different lives from their mothers \u2013 but never fully confronts the issue. The conflicted nature of the piece is summed up in Doon Mackichan's brilliant, almost burlesque turn as Hilary's sexually desperate friend Frances. It's a setpiece that brings the house down, but not one that feels as if it is grounded in reality.</p> <p>The whole thing is glued together by a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/15/tamsin-greig-interview\" title=\"\">remarkable performance from Greig</a>, who adroitly plays the role for laughs, but also movingly suggests a woman in mourning for her lost self. It's too long, however, and more convincing as an examination of liberal parenting (the best scene has parents gathered to discuss a teenage pregnancy) than of politics. Too often, also, it sacrifices credibility to comedy. But how often do you get a West End play that's intelligent, funny and puts contemporary mid-life women centre stage?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?button_hashtag=GdnReview\" class=\"twitter-hashtag-button\">Tweet #GdnReview</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script> </figure>",
  "<p>Working 9-5.30 all week doesn't give me much time to tend to my allotment. When I'm there, though, I love it. As a consequence, the temptation to get carried away is ever-present, but over the years I've learned that a burst of enthusiasm with a seed packet, wonderful as it is, can get you into a bit of a fix a few weeks down the line. Nobody wants their plot to become a burden, especially when there is so much else to be getting on with, so here are few tips to ensure your veg workflow stays at a constant pace.</p> <p>For low-maintenance plots, there are two aspects to consider, namely what you grow and how you grow it. When it comes to choosing low-maintenance crops, opt for winter squashes, drying beans, chillies, maincrop potatoes, rhubarb, globe and Jerusalem artichokes, beetroot, carrots, kale, onions, garlic, shallots, perpetual spinach and chard. All these crops, once planted, require a quick weed and water now and then, and no mollycoddling. If you don't religiously water any of the above, chances are that, when you do eventually visit the plot, there will be something for you to harvest, and it will be of good edible quality (OK, so yields might not be huge, but what did you expect?).</p> <p>That's half the secret: choosing crops that won't spoil if you don't harvest them at a fleeting peak. Peas, sweetcorn, radishes, broad, French and runner beans, courgettes and calabrese are also low-maintenance but their harvest window is brief, so you've got to visit the plot every few days to pick your moment. This year's wet weather has given me the most low-input, high-output beetroot ever \u2013 they've been brilliant. Parsley, mint, oregano, thyme and chives are good candidates too (fennel also self-seeds everywhere on our site, so we're never without it).</p> <p>So, to the care of them. The solution for weeds? Plastic or cardboard mulches \u2013 they're brilliant. Just lay them either side of your row, weigh them down and pop your hoe on eBay. Watering can be a bane in some years (not this one) but a good occasional soak is far better than a daily light sprinkle, so visiting your site every fortnight for an hour of watering is a prudent use of your time. Sinking bottles by the roots of large plants such as squashes and corn will make things even quicker \u2013 just fill up the bottle and walk away. The moisture will slowly soak into the rootzone, right where it's needed.</p> <p>Low-maintenance pest- and disease-control is not going to happen \u2013 gardeners need to regularly check over plants and nip any problems in the bud. All you can do is grow crops that show resistance to diseases that are known to be prevalent on your plot, such as tomato/potato blight and clubroot, and follow the \"prevention is better than cure\" rule as closely as we can. Net all brassicas against pigeons and cabbage white caterpillars. Erect a wire perimeter fence if rabbits are a nuisance. If anyone knows of a low-maintenance slug and snail option, let me know \u2013 at the moment organic pellets are my best suggestion. I grow salads and other edible leaves in my back garden where I can give this pest more attention.</p> <p>Of course, there's nothing to say that you can't spend more time on your allotment \u2013 many people do just that. The other night I was checking on a few late sowings and passed a couple taking a disposable barbecue and cool bag to their plot. I can't vouch for how much gardening they did, but I bet they had a great evening.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Lucy Halsall is the editor of <a href=\"http://www.growfruitandveg.co.uk/magazine/\">Grow Your Own magazine</a>, which contains a wealth of information about growing your own vegetables.

But was it 12 metres long, or 14, or 16? And how could we tell without a complete tail? Image: Scott Hartman</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I really did do my level best to come up with a title for this that didn't involve a tail/tale pun but failed to think of anything better so you're stuck with it. My apologies. On the upside though, you get an unfettered blog post about my latest research paper and it's on dinosaur tails. I've had some less than brilliant experiences with some media write-ups of my research and while there are also some superb science journalists out there, it's still nice to be able to put things out yourself and know that any mistakes are your own.</p> <p>Anyway, to dinosaur tails. A couple of years back I happened to start looking at the tails of various pterosaurs (the flying reptiles that lived alongside the dinosaurs) after a new specimen turned up that was obviously a member of a group that had short tails, but happened in this case to have a relatively long tail. This got me thinking about variation in tail lengths and how this might have evolved between various pterosaurs, and that led me onto thinking about the tails of dinosaurs. At the time I was working at <a href=\"http://archosaurmusings.wordpress.com/2009/12/29/the-ivpp/\">the famous IVPP</a> (understandably shortened from its title of Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology &amp; Paleoanthropology) in Beijing which happens to have a quite exceptional collection of dinosaur fossils, and especially those that have been preserved in unusually good conditions and often are associated with things like skin and feathers.</p> <p>These fossils one might expect would have pretty much every bone preserved, but a good hunt down of the available specimens soon revealed that even those blessed with feathers and the like very rarely had a totally complete tail. Often it was mostly there (or at least presumably so) but the tip would be gone. </p> <p>I widened my search and began digging into other museum collections, reading descriptions of fossils in scientific papers, checking out photos of dinosaur specimens and asking colleagues and simply trying to track down every dinosaur fossil I could that had a complete tail. Much effort was expended and the net result was almost literally just a handful of specimens where we had every bone in the tail. The very last bone in a vertebrate tail is an odd shape, so one can tell whether or not the tail is complete relatively easily. Now there were a good number which were all but complete, but while a tail might taper to almost a point which would reveal that nearly every bone is there, one can't be sure without this last one. Some tails do taper considerably but then run on for quite a length without the bones getting any smaller, so tapering alone may be deceptive.</p> <p>In short it turns out that really, despite having thousands of dinosaurs fossils including a good few hundred that could broadly be considered complete, we've got barely two dozen complete tails. The implication for this is that this is an area of dinosaur anatomy that really we don't know that much about. Yes we do indeed have lots of tails preserved and there's a lot of detail indeed in those specimens, but a fairly simple question of \"how long in total was this dinosaur\" could be really quite tricky to answer for a very good number of species.</p> <p>This is not a facile question, aside from the obvious public interest (when was the last time you saw a report on a new dinosaur that didn't suggest how long it was, if only in terms of double decker buses?). Total length is a measure that's been used by various researchers (myself included) over the years as a proxy for the mass of dinosaurs. If we've been over- or underestimating these values it could potentially affect our results quite a bit, so knowing whether or not these measures are right is worth checking. </p> <p>This is linked to the wider question of dinosaur size in general that I've been writing about over the last few posts. The size of an organism is intimately tied up with how much food and water it needs, what kind of territory it can control, how it moves, what its population might have been like and all kinds of other biological factors. Having a good handle on how large an animal is can tell you a lot about it and it's something worth finding out. </p> <p>So, are our previous estimates of total length any good? The immediate answer is apparently not, or at least I can't tell. My quick survey of the data showed that actually there was really quite a lot of variation there in the length of the tail. As discussed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/lost-worlds/2012/aug/24/weigh-dinosaur\">a few posts back</a>, the length of the femur (thigh bone) is a pretty good indicator of size so I used this as a way of scaling both the lengths of the tails of these species, and then also the length of the head and body of the same animal or a related species. </p> <p>These scaled results show that not only could tail length really vary a lot between species, but was also markedly more varied than that of the body when compared to the femur. In some ways this shouldn't be too much of a surprise: tail lengths vary a lot in the natural world (think bobcats vs leopards, and some lizards vs skinks) and there had been records for some time of dinosaurs with either very short or very long tails. Even so, such profound differences do seem to have been overlooked and moreover, some differences are startling.</p> <p>Take the bizarre scansoriopterigids. There are currently only two species known in this group and they are therefore close relatives of one another. One has one of the proportionally shortest tails known for any dinosaur that I recorded, but the other had one of the longest and that is incomplete and would be even longer in life! In short, it may not even be too safe to reconstruct a missing tail from a close relative when things like this happen. I was also lucky enough to get data from a couple of animals of the same genus a couple of times and here the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/lost-worlds/2012/aug/10/olympics-lesson-dinosaurs\">intraspecific variation</a> was also pretty high, again suggesting that length could be pretty variable. </p> <p>Beyond this we move into the hypothetical, but while the data collected is limited, I don't think it much of a stretch to think that some dinosaurs might have looked rather different to how they are traditionally imagined. We have no good tail material at all for the famous <em>Spinosaurus</em>, for example, and while there's a good few images out there for this animal, there's no real reason it could not have a tail half or double the length of how it's normally portrayed (as shown at the top).</p> <p>This might not really affect its mass very much \u2013 adding or taking off a couple of metres of thin tail and you'd only really make a difference of a few kilos on an animal that was upwards of 7 or 8 tonnes. But talking about an animal that was 12 metres or 16 metres long rather than 14 metres and that both sounds like a major difference and could have a significant effect when scaling things. For a researcher scaling that animal, 16 metres is a long way from 12 metres and would make a bigger difference to a mass estimate. </p> <p>A bigger change may come in our perceptions and, I hope, how we as researchers talk to the public about dinosaurs and how the media report on them. After all, a 16 metre <em>Spinosaurus</em> does <strong>sound</strong> a lot bigger than a 12 metre one, when in reality the difference is pretty slight and moreover we can't tell which of those is more likely without a near complete specimen to work from. I'd contend that a great number of oft repeated length estimates are likely grossly out and while many more are probably perfectly sound, it's hard to tell the difference at the moment. </p> <p>What would be better therefore, is to start talking about the body sizes of dinosaurs, effectively their length from snout to rump. That we know varies less than the tail and tends to be far more complete and is likely more stable between close relatives too as a result, meaning the value is likely to be rather more accurate. </p> <p>Right, I think that's probably more than enough on dinosaur tails for now. I'm afraid the paper is behind a paywall, but I imagine a few readers may be able to access it here and PDFs generally turn up online sooner or later.

  "<p>The scenes from a parched field near Rustenburg of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/17/south-african-police-shot-miners\" title=\"\">well-armed police officers opening fire on miners</a> waving spears and clubs has cast South Africa in a new light \u2013 that of a land of lowly citizens, kept in check by a distant elite of government ministers, and their friends in industry and the trade unions.</p> <p>If South African democracy is real, then the massacre at Lonmin's Marikana platinum mine should put nationalisation \u2013 or \"resource nationalism\" as it is has been coyly renamed by the ruling African National Congress (ANC) \u2013 back on the political agenda. It should not do so to humour the \"anything but [President Jacob] Zuma\" wing of the ANC but simply because there is an urgent need to address underdevelopment in a sector that employs 1 million people.</p> <p>\"The state of mining has not improved much since apartheid,\" says the development economist Margaret Chitiga-Mabugu of the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC). \"The mining charter requires the companies to do more than they do but the follow-up is just not there, which is a failing of the department of mineral resources.\"</p> <p>A judicial commission appointed by Zuma will investigate the killing of 34 miners on 16 August and the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/14/south-africa-lonmin-platinum-mine-clashes\" title=\"\">deaths in the preceding week at Marikana</a> of two police officers and eight strikers. The short timeline implied in the commission's remit is in danger of inviting an outcome that blames trade union rivalry, slaps Lonmin gently on the wrist and condemns police excesses.</p> <p>But a bigger picture of the South African mining sector shows the problems run far deeper. Coincidentally, on the eve of the Marikana tragedy, the church-funded <a href=\"http://www.bench-marks.org.za/\" title=\"\">Bench Marks Foundation</a> \u2013 which studies corporate social responsibility programmes \u2013 painted a grim picture of misery, death, poverty, illness and environmental damage in the world's richest platinum deposits in North West province.</p> <p>Its report, <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=communities%20in%20the%20platinum%20minefields&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bench-marks.org.za%2Fresearch%2Frustenburg_review_policy_gap_final_aug_2012.pdf&amp;ei=19g8ULr-F8q60QXxwoHYDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHobtdDtZPDhRasF3k-GhRy-bz2yA&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">Communities in the Platinum Minefields</a>, says platinum mining operations at Marikana \"include high levels of fatalities\" and that the \"residential conditions under which Lonmin employees live are appalling\".</p> <p>This was not news to the 25,000 miners at Marikana. Those who charged the police on 16 August had emerged from the Wonderkop settlement, where up to seven people sleep in each shack, and share taps and hot-wired electricity. Just as under apartheid, the residents are migrant workers and the settlement is a hotbed of social problems. These ill-educated men, mining one of the world's most expensive minerals for a net monthly payment of less than 5,000 rand (\u00a3380), had entrusted their lives to a healer who claimed his witchcraft would disable the police's firearms.</p> <p>Running what is effectively a single-party democracy, the ANC has the luxury of being able to be both for and against nationalisation at the same time. The ANC in government \u2013 supported by the National Union of Mineworkers \u2013 squirms at the concept, treating it as the \"loony\" machinations of ousted Youth League leader <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/julius-malema\" title=\"\">Julius Malema</a>. Just two weeks before the Marikana killings, Zuma told diplomats \"blanket nationalisation\" was not government policy.</p> <p>The trouble is that most South Africans want to own their subsoil. The government's plea that it cannot afford the estimated 1 trillion rand needed to buy out the private sector is compromised because senior ANC figures draw substantial dividends from their investments in Lonmin and other companies. At a policy conference in June \u2013 called to set the stage for the December conference at which Zuma is expected to seek re-election as party president \u2013 six out of nine ANC provinces were in favour of mine seizures.</p> <p>\"Marikana has put nationalisation back on the agenda,\" says Chitiga-Mabugu, one of the authors of HSRC's report <a href=\"http://anc.org.za/docs/discus/2012/sims.pdf\" title=\"\">State Intervention in the Minerals Sector</a>, commissioned by the ANC. It looks at resource management in countries such as Norway, Botswana, Angola and Chile, and rules out wholesale nationalisation for South Africa.</p> <p>But the report calls for a decisive state role in the sector: reviews of existing licences, a broadened tax regime, the closure of loopholes for under-reporting, and real strategies that would maximise the development benefits of South Africa's vast mineral wealth \u2013 including training and spinoff \"beneficiation\" industries.</p> <p>The HSRC report does not scapegoat the mining companies but points to deep governance flaws. It warns that little will be achieved without one major political change: the partners in government \u2013 the ANC, the Communist party and the Confederation of South African Trade Unions \u2013 need to start pulling in the same direction on economic policy.</p> <p>\"South Africa could have realised maximum benefit from its mines long ago, but over the years the priorities of the players have not been aligned,'' said Chitiga-Mabugu.</p> <p>The direction South Africa takes in the wake of the Marikana killings will tell us both about the past and the future. It will show whether the 18 years since the end of apartheid have been part of an uplifting journey of transformation driven by committed politicians or whether they have simply consolidated a marriage of convenience between black liberation fighters and white captains of industry.</p>",

A day from hell ensues, as his gang are murdered and exploded all over Wigmore Street by assailants unknown. Not until the very end does Shand discover who is responsible (Pierce Brosnan, as it turns out) but when he does, we are allowed to watch as it all sinks in. 'Oskins conveys this perfectly, from shock to confusion and a range of other emotions until there's nothing left.

Aviation already contributes 13% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions once non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions including soot, nitrogen oxides and water vapour are taken into account.</p> <p>Worryingly, those non-CO<sub>2</sub> effects are not even included in the Climate Change Act, and therefore are not in the Committee on Climate Change's advice to government on aviation, despite the warming impact being nearly double that of CO<sub>2</sub> alone.</p> <p>Unchecked growth in capacity at Heathrow and elsewhere would make it impossible for the UK to meet its target of reducing emissions by 80% by 2050 \u2013 a target which already falls short of what the science demands.</p> <p>Moreover, <a href=\"http://www.aef.org.uk/uploads/AEF_Passenger_Forecasts_analysis_1.pdf\" title=\"\">research by the Aviation Environment Federation</a> suggests that the UK already has sufficient airport infrastructure to meet the maximum levels of future demand that would be consistent with the limits on aviation growth recommended by the Climate Change Committee.</p> <p>The government's own forecasts of air-traffic demand indicate that even if airport growth was allowed to continue free of environmental legislation, passenger demand in the south east could be met solely via the existing infrastructure until almost 2030.</p> <p>The forecasts also overestimate demand by assuming that economic growth will pick up at around 2% or more every year \u2013 hardly likely in the current climate \u2013 and that there will be no increase in oil prices.</p> <p>As Yeo rightly recognises, the economics around aviation have changed a great deal since the coalition announced its opposition to a new Heathrow runway in 2010. The oil price has risen from around $80 per barrel in 2010 to more than $120 per barrel in 2012. This factor will have by far the greatest effect in reducing demand than any other.</p> <p>Furthermore, the idea that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/may/15/eu-airline-emissions-tax-success\" title=\"\">inclusion of aviation in the EU emissions trading scheme</a> is a get-out-of-jail-free card for the industry is a complete myth. While it was an important step, the scheme uses questionable calculations in order to offset the emissions abroad, and once again, fails to take into account the damaging impact of non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from aircraft.</p> <p>Finally, claims that biofuels will allow aviation to expand indefinitely without causing damage are highly flawed. It's likely that there will be always be a limit on the amount of sustainable biofuels available for use in aircraft; meanwhile, the environmental and social risks involved in giving ever more land over to growing crops for fuel, rather than food, are already well documented.</p> <p>Even aside from the environmental case against a third runway at Heathrow, the idea that one runway could ever play a significant role in our economic recovery is nothing more than a foolish distraction from what we actually need \u2013 wide-scale investment for the public good, in order to create jobs and stabilise the economy.</p> <p>Tim Yeo calls for political courage in the debate and I couldn't agree more. Those in favour of endless airport expansion must finally accept that there are ecological limits to aviation growth, be honest with the public about the priority shift we need in order to deal with climate change \u2013 and drop the third runway obsession, once and for all.</p>",
  "<p>As a sports fan, you get used to saying goodbye. Heroes come and go in the time it takes to remove a bit of Blu-Tack. You become hardened, almost immune. Most of the time. Every now and then, a retirement hits you like a bullet in the back. Andrew Strauss's farewell comes into that category. The parable of the 2005 Ashes taught us that eras can end at a speed and in a manner that makes little sense; even with that knowledge, however, it hard to believe that it has come to this.</p> <p>Strauss is a smart man who will have understood that, to adapt the old Enoch Powell quote, all England captaincy careers, unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture, end in failure, because that is the nature of sport and human affairs. Yet this ending is depressingly unbecoming. A sad ending? Fine, that's the game. But not such a grubby one.</p> <p>It is unfair to say this is entirely Kevin Pietersen's fault \u2013 the England captaincy gets everyone in the end, and Strauss said it was not a factor at all \u2013 but if he cannot see \"Straussy's\" blood on his hands, he has an even bigger lack of self-awareness than we feared. The fact half of Strauss's farewell press conference was spent discussing someone else was unavoidable but pretty disgusting. Et tu, KP?</p> <p>Strauss has been one of the best things to happen to English cricket in the Spin's lifetime, a monument of unflinching decency and underestimated talent who has almost imperceptibly enriched our lives. If there is one word that defines Strauss's career, it is probably 'equilibrium'. He rarely dealt in sexy or showy gestures, and had no inclination to distinguish between Kipling's two imposters. He was a reassuring constant and a positive force for English cricket.</p> <p>When England needed a calm head, Strauss invariably provided it. On the first day of the final Ashes Test in 2005, a cacophony of nervous desperation, Strauss made a century of indecent serenity. When English cricket was in disarray after the Pietersen-Peter Moores affair, Strauss and Andy Flower restored order with the minimum of fuss and then, well ahead of schedule, provided some unimaginable highs: consecutive Ashes wins, including a stunning first triumph in Australia for 24 years, and the ascent to top of the ICC Test rankings. Along the way there were seven consecutive home Test series wins and eight out of nine overall. Those were the times of our lives.</p> <p>As with most men who lead England for an extended period of time, Strauss's career will be defined by captaincy rather than batting \u2013 even if, on a personal level, he had more champagne moments than you might think: a hundred on debut, four Ashes centuries, two in one Test in Chennai in 2008, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JzwET63Iv0\" title=\"\">a staggering catch to dismiss Adam Gilchrist in 2005</a>, a huge hundred against India in the last World Cup and five man-of-the-series awards in Tests (an England record he shares with Graham Gooch).</p> <p>Ultimately, a Test average of 40.91 does not do justice to his ability, but when a batsman takes the England captaincy he is aware of the pact he is making and the near certain long-term sacrifice of his batting average. By the end Strauss had become a specialist in nothing scores in the 20s and 30s, the telltale sign of a scrambled mind. Yet in his early days, when his head was clearer and his soul unwearied, Strauss was a thrilling player who used a minimalist game plan \u2013 cut, pull, drive \u2013 to devastating effect. As well as that hundred on debut against New Zealand in 2004, another sign of his supreme temperament, and struck five centuries in his first 11 Tests. Three of those came during a tough tour of South Africa in 2004-05, when he batted with almost regal authority.</p> <p>When Strauss first came into the side he was known as Lord Brockett, with plenty of jokes about his background and public-school education. Sometimes he was painted as a harmless, almost buffoonish posh boy \u2013 another nickname in the England dressing-room was PT, and if we tell you the P stands for Posh you can probably join the dots \u2013 yet it soon became apparent that Strauss was as tough as they come. He did not exhibit that through raised voices or ostentatious gestures, but his authority was total. When he later became captain, he had a pool of players who, with one sad exception, would have run to the ends of the earth for him. One of the many reasons he had almost everyone on side is that he had no side to him.</p> <p>\"Strauss is one of those guys who demand respect,\" said Graeme Swann in his autobiography, \"and on a daily basis you never really fathom why. He just does. He always says the right things, whether it be in team meetings or press conferences, and his word is never questioned.\"</p> <p>He was a conservative tactician, though there are many who will argue vehemently that, in the modern age, this was emphatically a good thing. The most important element of Strauss's success as captain, however, was his character. At a time when masculinity is under scrutiny like never before, Strauss offered a seriously persuasive model of what 21st century man should look like: dignified, decent, proud, humble, equable, honest, fair, selfless, intelligent, inquisitive and deceptively charismatic. He was the big brother who always said the right thing, always did the right thing, and always looked after you. With him goes one of the great eras of English cricket.</p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 </em></strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/signup/2010/mar/30/1\" title=\"\"><strong><em>This is an extract from the Spin, the Guardian's free weekly cricket email.

  "<p>When someone comes to the end of their marriage and describes it as an \"anti-synergistic situation\" your first assumption is probably not that they're a Montana cattle rancher with a habit of getting into bar brawls. But that is exactly what Frank Copenhaver, the midlife crisis-stricken anti-hero of <a href=\"http://tommcguane.com/\" title=\"\">Thomas McGuane</a>'s eighth novel, is. Over the course of his a 40-plus year career, McGuane has consistently confounded expectations of what an outdoorsy, western novel should be. In Montana, where he's lived on his own ranch since the late 1960s after moving from his native Michigan, he's surrounded by schmaltzy, whimsical fiction writers who mythologise the west: novelists who, in his own words, would never write \"a scene where somebody was delivering a pizza\". His rugged protagonists are more angst-ridden and prone to overthinking \u2013 beefier, slightly-less-wise-cracking Woody Allens who often happen to drive pick-ups. \"It's not my job to put a smile on your face; that's the job of your bartender or pharmacist,\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/feb/10/featuresreviews.guardianreview10\" title=\"\">he told the Guardian in 2007</a>. If so, he's not quite doing his job right: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780749398965/nothing-but-blue-skies\" title=\"\">Nothing But Blue Skies</a> will often raise an (admittedly slightly uneasy) grin. How can it not, when it features a character who has made the mistake of \"marrying three duck hunters in a row\", or such wisecracks as \"Shorty didn't need to shave because the cat could lick his beard off\"?</p> <p>When Nothing But Blue Skies opens, Copenhaver has broken up with his wife, Gracie, and \"something has come completely loose inside\". When he thinks about her potential new lover, it feels to him like seeing \"a drooling new face at Mount Rushmore\". He consoles himself by spying on her best friend from a tree as she gets undressed, then sleeping with her. But the initial freedom that comes from the split soon turns into a consuming, directionless emptiness. His business collapses, and he starts to feel the fear of spending his life alone, the full realisation that perhaps he's no longer meant to be someone's. \"Loneliness \u2013 its not like other things that strengthen you,\" writes McGuane. \"Loneliness makes you weaker, makes you worse. I'm guessing enough of it makes you cruel.\"</p> <p>McGuane's own background contains a fair share of carousing, particularly alongside his friend <a href=\"http://jimharrison.com/\" title=\"\">Jim Harrison</a> during the 70s, when he wrote screenplays (most infamously <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074906/\" title=\"\">The Missouri Breaks</a>, starring Marlon Brando and Jack Nicholson) and got married to Margot Kidder (his second marriage of three). And Frank, similarly, has spent time in California in his youth, where \"everyone seemed surrounded by quotations\". Back then, his father wrote him off as a drunken sports lecher, but, between the numerous erections he experiences during Nothing But Blue Skies and makes little effort to conceal, Frank is prone to strange bouts of sensitivity, unexpected in an alpha male outdoorsman. He clashes with the cowboys who work for him, one of whom runs over his beloved dog (\"Dog ain't got no business under a tyre,\" is the employee's shrugging response) and another one of whom beats his wife and is memorably described as \"as kind to cows as he was unreasonable with people\". Frank is a man of simple desires \u2013 fishing, sex \u2013 but he's also thoughtful and introspective: much more so than the men who surround him and offer such nuggets of life advice as \"the lady doesn't marry the carpenter unless he's got a second home in Santa Monica or a two foot dick\".</p> <p>Nothing But Blue Skies is not a novel that reads at pace. Some of its slapstick comic scenes \u2013 the bar brawl, a crash involving a forklift log skidder \u2013 are almost worthy of the brilliant <a href=\"http://www.randomhouse.com/knopf/authors/russo/\" title=\"\">Richard Russo</a>, and it tends to luxuriate in them and in its setting, but you wouldn't quite call it a \"hangout book\": it's a little too tinged with despair for that. It was written in the early 1990s, just as the 1960s generation were coming to terms with the fact that they weren't going to live forever, and what seems to be really getting to Frank, as much as the collapse of his own marriage, is what he calls \"the escalating boredom of life in the monoculture\". He laments the new construction surrounding him, the music of his daughter's generation, listens to old Neil Young songs, wonders where the tone of apocalypse within them went and mourns the loss of the highs that drugs gave him in the early 70s. These are familiar themes now, but it's fascinating to witness them being voiced by a character who's not, say, a bohemian in Manhattan or a screenwriter in California, and to watch them being played out against a stunning big-skied backdrop: a place whose \"rhythmic hills\" betray \"sea floor origins\". As much as it confounds the tradition of western novels, Nothing But Blue Skies probably confounds the tradition of aging baby boomer novels even more.</p>",
  "<p>The Green party is about to embark on a new era that will change the way it presents itself to the electorate, with members voting to replace its high-profile leader, Caroline Lucas.</p> <p>Ballots for leader and deputy leader of the party in England and Wales close on Friday with the result announced on Monday. The new positions are being seen as ambassadorial roles for a party whose membership decides policy at conference. Members already know they will end up with one female and one male at the top of the party due to the gender balance rules in place to boost the representation of women in the upper echelons.</p> <p>But with so many women contenders across the two elections the worthwhile aim could backfire, since it effectively bars the possibility of two women being elected. If one of the three female contenders wins the leadership, either Duckworth and Mallender will be declared winner regardless of whether Allen or Phillips received more votes.</p> <p>Bennett says adjustments may need to be made for the future. \"There has been a lot of discussion about going to an 'at least one woman' rule rather than a gender balance rule.\"</p> <p>Lucas, the Greens' high-profile leader and sole MP, decided to stand down from the role in September after two terms. She will continue as an MP. Her deputy, Adrian Ramsay, will also step down.</p> <p>Contenders for the top job include three women: Romayne Phoenix, an anti-cuts activist and former arts teacher who served a four-year term as a Green councillor in Lewisham until 2010; businesswoman Pippa Bartolotti, who is leader of the Greens in Wales; and Natalie Bennett, a former Guardian journalist who recently stood in the London assembly elections where she was fourth on the party list.</p> <p>Bennett is seen as a frontrunner alongside Peter Cranie, a further education lecturer in social care who narrowly lost out to British National party leader, Nick Griffin, in the north-west region in the 2009 European parliamentary elections, and who is top of the list for the region for the next EU elections in 2014.</p> <p>With little sign of division on the party's direction, which stands to the left of Labour, the challenge for the candidates has been to convince members that they are the best placed to communicate the party as a credible alternative to the mainstream parties, increase the membership base \u2013now 12,400 \u2013 and boost its coffers.</p> <p>Lucas, who was already an MEP when she was first elected leader in 2008, had doubled membership under her watch. She made history when she became the first Green to be returned to Westminster after being elected MP for Brighton Pavilion in the 2010 general election.</p> <p>\"I feel that being leader helped me get elected in Brighton because it gave me that extra bit of profile and the opportunity to put policies across. If someone else can use that in the same way than I think that's all to the good.\"</p> <p>The leadership race takes place just months after the party celebrated coming third ahead of the Liberal Democrats in the high-profile London mayoral election, courtesy of its candidate, Jenny Jones. But in terms of actual electoral gains, the Greens had little impact after failing to win additional seats on the London assembly elections. The Greens gained five seats in local elections the same day.</p> <p>The party has two MEPs, two London assembly members, and 135 councillors across England. The Greens also took minority control of their first council, Brighton and Hove. With a thinly spread base of support across the country, the Greens favour elections fought under a proportional representation system, with the next leader looking to make big gains at the European elections in 2014.</p> <p>The party's key targets are defending their main assets, in the south-east region of England and London respectively, as well as looking to make gains in the north-west, south-west and the eastern region.</p> <p>What is clear is that none of the four candidates are indicating any desire to exploit the little sway they would have as leader to shift the policies more to the centre ground. The focus is on how to successfully broadcast the party's radical programme and shake off the single-issue climate-change tag to persuade disaffected Lib Dem voters that the Greens are a credible alternative.</p> <p>Bennett points to the Greens' pledges to scrap nuclear weapons and tuition fees, and to reinstate the educational maintenance allowance, which she believes will appeal to Lib Dems disaffected by the compromises of coalition government. She also believes some Labour voters could be persuaded to switch. Bennett, who was busy canvassing on the doorstep for the London assembly elections, said: \"People are not going back to Labour with any enthusiasm or at all happily so while certainly we will pick up votes from some of the lib dems, for whom we are the natural home, the problem is that there are not many Lib Dem voters to start off with \u2026 so we have to and we do appeal to lots of those Labour people by doing a much better job of presenting ourselves as a credible alternative.\"</p> <p>Cranie says the choice of leader will set the tone for the party's strategy. He believes it should \"invest to win\" by being willing to borrow from members in the runup to elections and from the Co-operative bank as a last resort, and by looking to trade unions as a potential source of support. He has set a target of increasing the party's MEPs from two to seven.</p> <p>A former Labour party member who joined the Greens in 1999, he believes the party needs to do more to highlight its longstanding commitment to social justice and equality.</p> <p>Committed to public services and a more progressive system of taxation, opposed to privatisation and the cuts hitting vulnerable groups, the party has policies that include free social care for elderly people in England and Wales, free dental care and prescriptions and a national minimum wage set at 60% of net national average earnings (\u00a38.10 an hour).</p> <p>On transport, the party has vowed to renationalise the railways to ensure \"a better service and lower fares\", which would encourage more people to leave their cars at home. The party also supports new eco-taxes, such as those on packaging and carbon emissions.</p> <p>Cranie does not believe there is much real appetite for Labour from those on the left, despite the party's recent council election successes last May. \"It is not so much a vote for Labour as much as a vote against the coalition,\" says Cranie. \"With the EU elections we have a huge opportunity there, because people are not voting with huge enthusiasm.\"The party also has hopes for the general election in 2015. Targets for prospective MPs the following year will include Norwich South, where the sitting Lib Dem has a majority of just 310 votes and where Ramsay, outgoing deputy, came fourth. There are also hopes for wins in Lib Dem strongholds in the south-west of England.</p> <p>Phoenix is convinced that by forging alliances and making common cause with the campaigns of unions and those opposed to cuts and privatisation, the party can convince more people on the left that the Green party is their natural home.</p> <p>\"Environmentalists, trade unionists and socialists should see the Green party as a natural home because all our values and our priorities should appeal to them.\"</p> <p>Bartolotti says one of the key challenges is getting the messages out. \"The Green party needs extraordinary leadership,\" she says. \"You can't do business as usual. We have absolutely got to be noticed.\"</p> <p>A cursory glance at recent byelection results highlights the scale of the challenge, with the party securing just 1.8% of votes in Feltham and Heston, and 1.5% respectively in Oldham East &amp; Saddleworth and Bradford West. Lewis Baston, senior research fellow at <a href=\"http://www.democraticaudit.com/\" title=\"\">Democratic Audit</a>, suggests the Greens have some way to go in turning the protest vote into significant electoral gains, not least because the party's popularity resides in small pockets of middle-class voters across the country.</p> <p>He predicts that Lucas, who as a Green MP has broken the \"credibility barrier\", will retain her seat at the next general election \u2013 even under boundary changes. But he believes that trying to win a second parliamentary seat in 2015 in Norwich South, a seat the Lib Dems wrested from Labour in 2010, will be \"pretty challenging\".</p> <p>Baston also suggests that an additional six or seven seats at the next set of European elections is a little too ambitious, saying the \"realistic maximum\" would be doubling their tally of seats to four. \"I don't think there will be much of a breakthrough in the elections over the next few years, more incremental progress.\"</p> <p>Members must choose a deputy leader from four candidates: Caroline Allen, a north London vet, and three councillors: Alexandra Phillips, Will Duckworth and Richard Mallender.</p> <h2>Frontrunners</h2> <p><a href=\"http://pippabartolotti.com/post/24611308049/candidate-statement-for-green-party-leader-2012\" title=\"\"><strong>Pippa Bartolotti </strong></a></p> <p>Bartolotti became leader of the Welsh Green party in January.

  "<p>Today sees the launch of the 2012 Paralympic Games right here in the UK and Channel 4 will cover the events as no disability games have been covered before.</p> <p>Like any world-class athletes, Paralympians will have dedicated much of lives to being the best, the fastest, the most skilful. For a lifetime they will have trained and pushed themselves beyond endurance, just as the Olympians that went before them.</p> <p>Of course, just as very few able-bodied people become Olympians, so only a few people with disabilities will ever become Paralympians. Do you imagine you could run faster than Mo Farah or Usain Bolt? Do you have the mental resilience, commitment and single-mindedness to achieve all that Steve Redgrave achieved? It's unlikely. However, in the coming days, we may well hear UK politicians sound as though they're using this wonderful event to suggest all sick or disabled people could win gold, if only they tried a little harder.</p> <p>Disability affects people in different ways. Some may be able to see losing their sight as an opportunity; others as an endless succession of dark tomorrows. A broken spine may spur some on to overcome, but for others it may be years before they can come to terms with a life unrecognisable from the one they knew.</p> <p>A child from an inner city estate will face barriers to accessing sport that a child from a wealthy background may not. This is true regardless of physical abilities, but even more so for a disabled child living in poverty, who dreams of becoming the new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/26/tanni-grey-thompson-paralympic-star\" title=\"\">Tanni Grey-Thompson</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/aug/06/interview.taraflood\" title=\"\">Tara Flood</a>.</p> <p>Sportsmen and women are often reluctant to politicise sport, but disabled athletes simply cannot separate the two.</p> <p>Those with serious disabilities \u2013 and many of the athletes we will cheer on to greatness in the next few days \u2013 have extra expense in their lives. Just getting to a training session is a challenge. Paying for mobility aids, or adaptations to sports equipment, is expensive. Staying healthy and strong when you have a disability can be a challenge over and above those of more able-bodied athletes. Some will experience periods of ill health, times when they cannot work or train.</p> <p>And this is where our social security system has supported these athletes to be all that they can be. The disability living allowance will have helped many of them with those extra costs. The DLA is a non-means tested benefit, paid to Paralympians, people in work and those for whom work will always be impossible. Incapacity benefit may have provided a small income during periods of ill health or recovery. Some will have received support from the independent living fund.</p> <p>But that is all under threat today. DLA is being abolished and 500,000 people with mental or physical disabilities will have support stripped away.

  "<p>Madonna has issued a \"manifesto\", attempting to justify the violent imagery in her MDNA tour. According to her 440-word statement, these concerts are meant as \"journeys from darkness to light, from anger to love [and] from chaos to order\", with the singer playing \"both \u2026 good guys and bad guys\".</p> <p>\"It's very important to me as an artist that my show not be taken out of context,\" the singer wrote in a <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/news#yERZ5dRbH3l5dkyk.99\" title=\"\">letter to Billboard</a>. \"It must be watched with an open heart from beginning to end.\" The singer has been criticised about the gun play in her stage show. In her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/22/madonna-hyde-park-2012-review\" title=\"\">review for the Observer</a>, Kitty Empire wondered whether the \"trigger-happy\" 50-year-old is \"glorifying firearms\". \"The violence is pretty graphic,\" she wrote, \"given the smattering of kids in attendance, and those onstage.\"</p> <p>\"It's true there is a lot of violence in the beginning of the show and sometimes [there is] the use of fake guns,\" Madonna wrote. \"But they are used as metaphors. I do not condone violence or the use of guns. Rather they are symbols of wanting to appear strong and wanting to find a way to stop feelings that I find hurtful or damaging.</p> <p>\"In my case its wanting to stop the lies and hypocrisy of the church, the intolerance of many narrow-minded cultures and societies I have experienced throughout my life, and in some cases the pain I have felt from having my heart broken.</p> <p>\"The enemy is within,\" Madonna wrote, echoing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/23/madonna-marine-le-pen-swastika\" title=\"\">her comments about Marine Le Pen</a>. \"In spite of all the chaos and darkness and intolerance we seem to be encountering more and more in the world, we cannot allow our anger or bitterness to swallow us up \u2026 There is an innate and pure love inside us all and we have to find a way to tap into it \u2026 We can't do it by being victims or placing the blame or pointing the finger at others.\"</p> <p>The singer's idealism, however, feels a little out of place in a tour that is named, at least in part, after an illegal drug. At recent concerts, Madonna has spoken out in support of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/20/madonna-pussy-riot-verdict\" title=\"\">Pussy Riot</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/17/madonna-sued-gay-rights-russia\" title=\"\">gay rights</a>, but she has also courted controversy by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yd4sHbCY5w\" title=\"\">flashing her breasts</a> and asking<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/27/deadmau5-madonna-ecstasy-ultra-festival\" title=\"\"> for drugs</a>.</p> <p>Madonna will perform in Montreal on Thursday night.</p>",

  "<p>Labour peer Lord Mandelson has waded into the row over the naked Prince Harry photos, saying it highlights the potential damaging effect of the internet on society.</p> <p>Mandelson said he believes Prince Harry's privacy was breached by the photos but the real issue is not about the Sun's defiant decision to print the photos but the lack of regulation of the internet.</p> <p>\"The bigger question is how the domestic media market can be made economic and subject to any form of regulation in an era when, a click away, there is access to information that respects no national boundaries and the laws of no single national parliament or the basic standards of conventional journalism,\" he wrote in <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/307fcc0e-f047-11e1-b7b2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz24v3j9sHn\" title=\"\">a letter to today's Financial Times</a>.</p> <p>He said it is difficult to see a future for newspapers when the internet has \"ransacked\" their business.</p> <p>\"It is hard to see how some of the best-known sources of quality English-language journalism \u2013 the Times, New York Times, the Guardian spring to mind \u2013 will ever make money again,\" he added.</p> <p>The Sun last week said it was \"absurd\" to continue the British black out and defended publishing two photos of the naked prince on the grounds that they were freely available across the internet, including on the websites of mainstream media organisations such as CNN.</p> <p>Mandelson said how \"we come to grips with the fact that the internet is giving public access to uncorroborated, undigested and unmediated news, all in the name of free speech, is becoming one of the defining issues of the 21st century\".</p> <p>His remarks come as the debate about the Sun's decision to publish the photos of a naked Prince Harry in a Las Vegas hotel room rumbles on.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/28/sun-naked-prince-harry-complaints\" title=\"\">Press Complaints Commission has now received more than 3,600 complaints,</a> largely from members of the British public.</p> <p>However, the PCC has not received a complaint from Prince Harry's representatives, despite a warning last week from Prince Charles's personal solicitors that there was no justification in English law for publication.</p> <p>Royal aides are said to still be undecided as whether to press ahead with an official complaint.

  "<p>Lord Justice Leveson is expected to launch what is being described as \"excoriating\" criticism of the press after notices went out to all newspaper groups warning them that he anticipates making rulings on everything from privacy to self-regulation.</p> <p>It is understood the same generic letter has gone to all the main national newspaper groups, but executives are anxiously awaiting more damaging Rule 13 notices containing specific criticism of individual titles and witnesses.</p> <p>Leveson's Rule 13 notice is understood to be around 100 pages long with a five-page summary listing the areas Leveson is intending to make critical pronouncements on, according to sources.</p> <p>These are expected to contain explicit adverse comment and could go to anyone in a newspaper group Leveson feels has failed to uphold standards, as well as individuals from any other sectors who face criticism in the judge's final report. Witnesses during the 197-day inquiry included politicians, police and media regulators.</p> <p>Rule 13 of the Inquiry Rules 2006, obliges Leveson to give those he intends to criticise a right to reply before publication.</p> <p>Those with sight of the first batch of Rule 13 notices said the appeals court judge has thrown the \"kitchen sink\" at the newspaper industry. \"It is excoriating,\" said a source.</p> <p>The executive summary is understood to cover specific areas including self-regulation, invasion of privacy, the issue of prior notification of publication, accuracy and public interest.</p> <p>The letter is divided into sections with headline assertions such as \"self-regulation has failed\" backed up with references to the evidence.</p> <p>Newspaper groups and others are anxiously awaiting the second batch of Rule 13 notices which could be more damaging corporately.</p> <p>Leveson said during the inquiry that his findings were intended to provide a narrative on which to base recommendations. But he added that if he felt the need to make a \"specific criticism of any sort against an individual or title, a separate notice would be provided\".</p> <p>News International is preparing for the worst in the wake of the phone-hacking affair, which included the hacking of Milly Dowler's phone, but will be doing its best to deflect criticism of its flagship brand the Sun, hoping that the now defunct News of the World is Leveson's main target.</p> <p>Leveson <a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Application-of-Rule-13-of-the-Inquiry-Rules-2006.pdf\" title=\"\">said earlier in the inquiry</a> that he will not make findings as to the culture and ethics of individual titles \"save, perhaps, in relation to the News of the World\", but put newspapers on notice that he may make specific criticisms of individual titles.</p> <p>The Press Complaints Commission is also expected to be heavily criticised, but it has already accepted its fate and is currently winding down.</p> <p>Tabloid editors linked to what the inquiry described as \"egregious\" breaches of the PCC code of practice seem unlikely to escape censure by Leveson.</p> <p>He has already criticised the Daily Express over coverage of the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. During the inquiry <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/dec/21/daily-express-obsessed-madeleine-mccann\" title=\"\">he accused the newspaper of writing \"complete piffle\" and \"tittle-tattle\"</a> about the McCanns.</p> <p>The Daily Mirror will also be in his sights in relation to its coverage of Christopher Jefferies, the Bristol landlord questioned by police about the murder of Joanna Yeates, but released without charge and cleared of any involvement. Former editor Richard Wallace apologised to the inquiry for this coverage.</p> <p>Leveson has said that under the legislation, he has discretion about warning anyone who is \"criticised expressly or inferentially in the evidence in order\" but said in a ruling during the inquiry that he \"cannot include any explicit or significant criticism of a person to whom I have not given such a warning\".</p> <p>It means that those who do not receive a second warning letter can confidently expect to escape censure in his final report.</p> <p>One national newspaper source said the letter was \"very confusing\" because it set out every single criticism of the press that emerged from the inquiry, but didn't specify which ones Leveson was going to agree with. </p> <p>\"He has listed absolutely everything, exhaustively. It's just a portmanteau of all the criticism and newspaper groups are expected to respond to this, but it very confusing. It's like he wants the newspapers to do the winnowing.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>Which of us can put hand on heart and say: \"I have never neglected a friend?\" Who hasn't had reason to regret a failure&nbsp;to visit or a phone call that has gone unmade? The unnamed woman in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-JtOTH6Eb4\" title=\"\">Jennifer Tremblay</a>'s powerful monologue has more reason for repenting her inaction than most. \"I&nbsp;didn't lay a finger on her, but it's as if&nbsp;I&nbsp;killed her,\" she says, fixing us with her blue, anguished eyes.</p> <p>The \"her\" is Caroline, a friendly neighbour in a small community. The woman has moved from the city, and finds the country threatening: the fields menace her, and even the walk to the tree at the end of the garden is overwhelming. She's not coping well with her children or husband, either. She tries to keep control of her life by making lists obsessively. When Caroline extends the hand of friendship, the woman is all too ready to judge this new friend for the messiness of her home, overflowing with children and washing.</p> <p>But, as the woman's racked story of motherhood, female friendship and love&nbsp;tumbles out, it is she who is being judged. We, the audience, sit high above like a jury in a courtroom.

  "<h2>Best of this week's news</h2> <p>It's all over for another year on the Edinburgh fringe, but we mustn't leave without reporting that the terrific Rubberbandits won the <a href=\"http://entertainment.stv.tv/onstage/187418-winners-of-malcolm-hardee-awards-2012-revealed-at-edinburgh-fringe/\" title=\"\">Malcolm Hardee award for Comic Originality</a> in a ceremony on Friday night. The awards, named after the maverick alternative comedy promoter who died in 2005, celebrate the \"true anarchic spirit of the Edinburgh fringe\". The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-19374887\" title=\"\">Cunning Stunt award</a> for best publicity stunt was given to standup Stuart Goldsmith, for his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TM_wyHgFdQ\" title=\"\">YouTube videos</a> protesting the censorship of his show title (Prick), and challenging critics not to make phallic puns when reviewing it. Meanwhile, despite anecdotal evidence that fringe attendances were drastically down in 2012, figures now reveal a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-19390024\" title=\"\">mere 1% drop in ticket sales on last year</a>. And given there was a 6% increase in the number of shows, the fringe can be seen to have held up well in Olympics year. In total, 1.85m tickets were sold to 2,695 shows (free fringe shows are not counted).</p> <p>A raft of new TV comedies have been announced \u2013 several of them at the Edinburgh Television festival, which took place last weekend. David Walliams is to follow in Jack Whitehall's footsteps, with an education-themed sitcom for BBC1, <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/david-walliams-and-ben-elton-set-1278125\" title=\"\">entitled Autumn Leaves</a>.

The writers are James (Rev) Wood and Rupert Walters, who worked on Spooks.

NBC-affiliate station KSL-TV have deemed the show \"inappropriate\" for family viewing, sparking protests from the show's stars and from gay and lesbian groups.</p> <p>And finally \u2013 the great Flight of the Conchords unleashed a new song this week, a spoof(ish) charity single in aid of the <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/filmandtv/news/flight-of-the-conchords-reunite-to-release-charity/282501\" title=\"\">New Zealand organisation Cure Kids</a>. \"It's basically a We Are the World-style song with guest appearances from everybody we could find,\" says the director of New Zealand's Red Nose Day event, Brooke Howard-Smith (note to UK or US viewers: you're unlikely to recognise any of the other singers). The Conchords \u2013 Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement \u2013 are currently touring New Zealand and Australia.</p> <h2>Our pick of this week's Guardian comedy stories</h2> <p>\u2022 Who knew that Aussie comic Adam Hills was originally inspired by Victor Borge?

Prompted by the death of Phyllis Diller, the Atlantic magazine in the States has published a piece arguing that pretty women have to <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/08/why-do-so-many-pretty-female-comedians-pretend-theyre-ugly/261510/\" title=\"\">pretend to be ugly in order to be good comics</a>. \"Why can't funny women be hot? Or accomplished? Or smart?\" asks writer Ashley Fetters. \"Why do so many women with these otherwise highly valued traits have to downplay them to get laughs?\" The article leans heavily on the career of Tina Fey to push the point that attractive women have to pretend to be gawky and gormless to get laughs.</p> <p>Cue a <a href=\"http://splitsider.com/2012/08/lets-pick-apart-this-god-awful-article-about-how-pretty-women-cant-be-successful-comedians\" title=\"\">derisive response on the Splitsider comedy website</a>, whose correspondent calls the Atlantic's premise \"completely flawed,\" and its argument \"a blatant example of starting with a theory and then searching for evidence that'll support it\". Rightly pointing out that the example of Fey isn't a persuasive one, given that she's clearly attractive and doesn't attempt to hide it, Splitsider writer Adam Frucci accuses Fetters of ignorance of contemporary comedy. Victory is sealed \u2013 in my eyes, at least \u2013 when he concludes with the screamingly obvious point that \"no male comedians are out there attempting to look like stable, datable hunks in order to get laughs. [And] playing a weird or silly character in order to get laughs is not specific to one gender.\"</p> <h2>Over to you \u2013 my pick of the week's reader comments</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/aug/23/whatever-happened-to-harry-hill\" title=\"\">Lucy Mangan's rave TV review</a> of Harry Hill's mockumentary and Vic and Bob's one-off quiz show Lucky Sexy Winners divided opinion among our readers. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17877085\" title=\"\">Dourscot</a> belied his own alias with the following remark:</p> <blockquote> Utterly magnificent by Hill (and Vic and Bob).

Genius. </blockquote> <p>Whereas <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17886717\" title=\"\">DickTurnip</a> dissented with the following, delightfully paradoxical plea:</p> <blockquote> [Lucky Sexy winners] just seemed like a pale imitation of Shooting Stars.

Frankie Boyle's humour is unoriginal and tedious. So are jokes about Camilla Parker-Bowles's appearance. Or Cherie Blair's appearance. Or John Prescott's size. So was Ricky Gervais at the Golden Globes when, out of all the thousands of funny jokes you could make about Hugh Hefner, he decided to make one about him being old \u2026 These jokes don't prompt me to laugh, or gasp. They don't deserve any more than a weary sigh. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, on the comments thread after Nadeem Akhtar's article about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/shortcuts/2012/aug/26/drag-kings-standup-women-comedy\" title=\"\">drag kings taking the comedy world by storm</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17928179\" title=\"\">carsick</a> proposed traditional British Christmas entertainment as the solution to all prejudice:</p> <blockquote> In a sense one could see most modern-thinking women as drag kings unconsciously celebrating masculinity with comic effect. Gender performance as vaudeville is a logical next step. Drag kings though have some way to go to catch up with drag queens who are a long-standing and quite conservative institution. Perhaps true equality lies in panto. </blockquote> <p>Which is quite a thought. Have a good week.</p>",
  "<p><em>Boneland</em> is an adult sequel to the two books for children <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/alangarner\" title=\"\">Alan Garner</a> published in 1960 and 1963. Colin and Susan, in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780007355211/the-weirdstone-of-brisingamen\" title=\"\"><em>The Weirdstone of Brisingamen</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780007127870/the-moon-of-gomrath\" title=\"\"><em>The Moon of Gomrath</em></a>, are twins of about 12, rushing about on non-stop miraculous adventures and accepting supernatural events with almost superhuman placidity. At the end of the second book, Susan appears to be destined for an otherworldly fate or role. At the beginning of this third book, she has vanished. Her brother Colin has aged some 30 or 40 years, and their author nearly 50.</p> <p>Fifty years is a long time between books, yet it seems right and natural that Garner should need five decades to gyre back round to where he began, the legend-haunted landscape of Alderley Edge, to be able to follow his story deeper into the human psyche and the dark abysm of time.</p> <p>Colin has become a brilliant astrophysicist, ornithologist, and all-round savant with five or six masters' degrees, as well as being an outstanding cook, carpenter, and social misfit. He has total recall of everything that has happened to him since the age of 13, but has lost all memory of the years before that, along with his sister, and his intrepidity. The almost phlegmatically fearless child has become an anguished, supersensitive, self-absorbed man whose incoherent obsessions are driving him mad.</p> <p>Colin is searching for his sister and his sanity, but the wellbeing of the world is also at stake. The descendant of men who danced and sang on Alderley Edge to keep the stars in their courses and bring the sun back from winter death, Colin is a shaman, heir of the shamans of the ice age and ages long before. He needs to find his own balance because his job is to keep the balance of the world. The rocks and caves of a reef of Triassic sandstone in Cheshire are the axis of the balance, the navel of the universe, the centre that must hold.</p> <p>That centre is also in a cave in Delphi, an island in the Klamath River of California, a thousand places on Earth, and the Earth itself as revealed to the astronaut Rusty Schweickart on a walk in space \u2013 wherever human beings feel the depth of their connection to the world and take it as a sacred responsibility.</p> <p>Yet this universal connection is felt as deeply local. This place is the sacred place. More mythmaker than fantasist, Garner names his chosen, actual landscape minutely, feature by feature, stone by stone, relishing the old place-names and the grand vocabulary of geology, weaving the words into a litany of confirmation, the endless repetition that keeps the end from coming, the rhythmic dance on the world's edge that maintains the world. Alderley Edge is the scene of a timeless ritual that must be re-enacted over and over by ignorant and ephemeral mortals. Personal tragedy and redemption are subsumed in the cosmic vision.</p> <p>No wonder that the people of his story are less characters than masks, types, archetypes. But as imaginative literature reclaims the territories forbidden it by realism, and moves back from Elfland towards the outskirts of Manchester, it treads on risky ground. Readers looking for more than mere adventure expect characters whose behaviour and reactions are humanly comprehensible.</p> <p>The child twins Colin and Susan were semi-characterless actors in a fantasy tale. Colin is both severely disturbed radio-astronomer and the man chosen from his generation to \"look after the Edge\" \u2013 and how to reconcile these roles in a character in a modern novel? How are the pyschic sufferings of a man so anachronistically fated and so emotionally crippled to be made comprehensible?</p> <p>The author's success hinges partly on his division of the character into two \u2013 the 21st-century scientist Colin and an unnamed stone age ancestor. But in the end, his success must depend on the reader's willingness to be teased through an imaginative labyrinth by allusions, hints, puzzles, and tricks such as unascribed dialogue and undescribed location. The process of Colin's healing, the stages of therapy, the un-nesting of image within image, is fascinating, but the narration demands that the reader let the author manipulate and control, just as Colin is manipulated by the analyst.</p> <p>And she, in the end, appears to have been a witch or goddess: in a serious novel, this is again risky.</p> <p>Garner can count on the trust and admiration of many of his readers to see him through it, but my trust and admiration, though great, weren't always sufficient. No rereading has yet given me a clue to the meaning of the first eight lines of <em>Boneland</em>. Is the all-wise, wise-cracking, motorcycle-riding psychoanalyst the Witch-Crone or the Moon Mother? Is Susan one of the Pleiades? Is truth, as Garner would have it, not attainable through knowledge, only through belief?</p> <p>Where all the teases and all the risks pay off, for me, is in the shadow-story of the man who \"looked after the Edge\" so long ago, the solitary artist-shaman of the ice age. These sections of the book are told in a charged, elliptical, symbolic, highly concrete language: \"He cut the veil of the rock; the hooves clattered the bellowing waters below him in the dark. The lamp brought the moon from the blade, and the blade the bull from the rock. The ice rang.\"</p> <p>You figure out what it's all about gradually; as with poetry, learning another language, learning to see and think differently, the demands and rewards are intense and real. It is this element of the book, in which the obsessions come into focus and a true balance is glimpsed, that will bring me back to <em>Boneland</em>, knowing I'll find there what no other novelist has ever given us.</p> <p>\u2022 Ursula K Le Guin's <em>Lavinia</em> is published by Phoenix.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/27/gps-unsympathetic-infertile-women-study\" title=\"\">survey</a> that has found half of infertile woman find their GP unsympathetic or ignorant about their condition comes as no surprise to me. I must have seen 18 GPs over the nine years I have been trying to have a baby and bar one, a woman, none of them showed any sympathy towards me or any knowledge about what help I may need or where I could get it.</p> <p>I'd never had a problem with GPs before. I'm deaf in one ear and have rheumatoid arthritis and they've always known what to do about these conditions, but when it comes to problems having a child they have just tried to fob me off. It started when I was pregnant for a second time. My first pregnancy was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy\" title=\"\">ectopic</a>, which was very distressing, and I was told to get a scan when I became pregnant again by the gynaecological team who removed the first ectopic pregnancy as the same problem could happen again. We'd moved house, so I went to my new GP. But his response to my request for a scan was: \"There's no need for that, touch wood you'll be fine.\" I was gobsmacked but refused to leave his room until he referred me to the hospital. I put in a complaint about him and moved surgeries.</p> <p>Unfortunately, my fears about my second pregnancy were founded. It was ectopic and was followed by a third ectopic pregnancy. The GPs seemed to have no idea, and didn't seem to care why I couldn't have children. I don't know if it's because you don't see the same GP from one appointment to the next. It's not like the old family GP you know from birth who knows you and your family's history. Now there is no continuity of care. When I asked for some counselling to get me through losing three babies because I couldn't cope psychologically, the GP sent me to a general counselling service. They said I needed help for bereavement. I eventually found a specialised charity myself.</p> <p>My next option was to go down the IVF route. I was in my early 30s and by now had only one fallopian tube. When I tried to find out whether my husband and I were eligible for NHS funding, my GP couldn't tell me. When we discovered that we weren't eligible because my husband already has two children \u2013 although it had been established by then that it was my problem because my tubes didn't work \u2013 my GP could have assisted us to appeal against this decision. He said he'd put it to the board of GPs but unless you are constantly bugging them, you never hear anything. They didn't appeal.</p> <p>What I don't understand is why GP surgeries don't have a basic information pack with a list of IVF clinics in the area that they can recommend. Given that women are waiting longer to have children and then discovering they have problems conceiving, there must be a growing demand for these services and GPs should step up to the mark. We had to research clinics ourselves on the internet.</p> <p>But it's not just GPs who show a lack of compassion and understanding when it comes to fertility issues. Ahead of the IVF treatment I was referred to a male gynaecological consultant by the IVF clinic to check that my one tube wasn't blocked and to get it removed at the request of the IVF consultant. I asked if he would remove the tube during the procedure. When I came to, he said he hadn't done as I'd requested because in his words: He wasn't \"going to sterilise a 33-year-old woman, he'd rather I had 28 more ectopic pregnancies as with the tube there was still a chance, not matter how slim\". Anyone who has had to endure an ectopic pregnancy themselves would never say that.</p> <p>Our first attempt at IVF was unsuccessful, resulting in a further ectopic pregnancy, followed by further surgery to remove that final tube and parts of my uterus. A year on, I have been sterilised and we are now contemplating whether or not I am brave enough to try IVF again. If I am, I will not doubt have to confront more unhelpful doctors' attitudes. It shouldn't have to be like this.</p>",

  "<p>In the midst of post-landing activities, and before setting off on its first substantial drive, Nasa's Mars rover Curiosity is using the scorch marks of its own landing to study the red planet's surface.</p> <p>Settling down to begin regular science activities on the floor of 150km-wide Gale Crater, Curiosity's operators have been testing the nuclear-powered vehicle's many science instruments, its driving capabilities, as well as its radio transmission abilities. Following short test drives last week, and the first extension of its robotic arm, more of the rover's instruments have been turned on and found to be working perfectly.</p> <p>Curiosity team members proudly presented on Monday an sample image taken by one of the rover's main scientific cameras. The colour camera, equipped with a 100mm focal length lens <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=4566\" title=\"\">to zoom in on fascinating features</a>, clearly reveals layered terrain up to 16km from the landing site. Curiosity is due to be driven around 10 metres to take another image of the same distant location, allowing a stereo picture of the hills to be created.</p> <p>These images of the foothills of Mount Sharp, at the centre of Gale Crater, immediately threw up a geological puzzle. They clearly consist of layered material, but while the lower strata within them are close to horizontal, <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=4559\" title=\"\">upper layers are inclined</a>. This suggests that the top strata were preferentially deposited in one direction, but identifying the process responsible, which could be volcanic or wind-driven, for example, may have to wait until Curiosity can visit the hills.</p> <p>Landing on 6 August, the rover descent stage's powerful rockets <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=4477\" title=\"\">scoured patches of the surface</a> while hovering over the landing spot, dislodging surface dust and possibly altering the surface material. On Monday, Curiosity was manoeuvred to park over one of these greyish scour features, which can even be seen from orbit.</p> <p>This unusual parking spot was chosen so that the rover's Russian-led Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN) instrument can bombard the soil under the rover with neutrons to measure the amount of hydrogen there, as a proxy for water and water ice.</p> <p>This is likely to be one of the few places that Curiosity will visit where the surface won't be covered by a layer of dust. The rover's laser-equipped ChemCam instrument will also probe the scour marks to determine their composition.</p> <p>The rover's operators have gradually been increasing the rate at which data is sent back to Earth. More than 7 gigabits of data have already been transmitted. The fastest way for Curiosity to send data is via the three spacecraft currently operating in orbit around Mars: the Nasa satellites Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and the European Space Agency's Mars Express.</p> <p>The fastest rates are achieved via MRO: when passing over the rover, Curiosity and the satellite also communicate via a second test communications channel, which allows the speed at which science data is broadcast to be increased to up to 2 megabits per second when conditions are good.</p> <p>One of the rover's unique instruments \u2013 the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) \u2013 has set about sniffing the makeup of Mars's atmosphere. Unexpected traces of methane \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2009/jan/15/mars-controversiesinscience\" title=\"\">a possible signature of life</a> \u2013 in first sample of gas caused great excitement back on Earth \u2026 until it was realised that a small amount of gas from Earth had been carried to Mars inside the instrument.</p> <p>One of the experiment's aims is to double-check measurements made by the Viking landers in 1976, measure isotope ratios in the atmosphere and attempt to detect methane. The latter is known to exist on Mars but its origin is currently a mystery.</p> <p>The rover will leave its landing site for good this week, first travelling at least 100 metres away so that it can sample surface material unaffected by its landing. It will then head for a spot named Glenelg, chosen as a target as it's the meeting point of three types of terrain.</p> <p>The ultimate goal for Curiosity will be the foothills of Mount Sharp where the layered terrain has been glimpsed, but it is unlikely to arrive for at least another year.</p> <p>The Curiosity team has also played from Mars <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1325\" title=\"\">an audio message</a> delivered by Nasa administrator Charles Bolden. Echoing Soviet broadcasts of the Internationale from the moon, this will be followed later on Tuesday by music recorded by will.i.am.</p> <p>In the words of Dave Lavery, Nasa Curiosity programme executive, with photographs, SAM data and audio signals being sent to Earth, for the first time we have \"the sounds, the sights, and the smells of Mars\".</p>",
  "<p>A day after G4S revealed the cost of its Olympic contract shambles, fellow outsourcer <strong>Serco</strong> revealed a drop in profits due to reorganisation costs and order delays.</p> <p>The company, whose contracts include the Docklands light railway in London, prisons and air traffic control centres, said half year profits fell from \u00a3123m to \u00a3102m before exceptional items. In the UK and Europe, revenues fell 1% following fewer contracts in the welfare to work market, while conditions in the US federal outsourcing markets remained difficult. Overall, first half like for like revenues fell by 2%.</p> <p>But the company was positive about the outlook, with its performance expected to be weighted to the second half and a rise in contract awards during the first half from \u00a32.5bn to \u00a34.2bn. It has identified \u00a331bn of further opportunities for the group. Chief executive Christopher Hyman said:</p> <blockquote> Our business in Australasia and the middle east continues to grow strongly and, while significant challenges in the US remain, we see conditions in the UK starting to improve. The recent level of new contract wins across the group will help us deliver the anticipated strong financial performance in the second half of the year. </blockquote> <p>This optimism has helped lift Serco's shares by 4p to 566.5p in a falling market. Analyst Robert Morton at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> Serco's interim results are well down on last year, reflecting a difficult trading background as well as a reorganisation programme. Cash generation in the first half was also disappointing, although there were timing elements within the shortfall.

  "<p>Despite the daily invasion of tourists that flood Venice, some neighbourhoods retain a down-to-earth village feeling, where there are still butchers and bakers rather than mask and glass shops. In the residential quarter around the Ormesini and Sensa canals at the northern end of Cannaregio you can still enjoy a real slice of genuine Venetian life. Here are 10 of the best bars, restaurants and shops to check out.</p> <h2>Al Timon</h2> <p>Al Timon has fast established itself as not just the favourite rendezvous for locals of Cannaregio, but a popular hangout for students and young Venetians from all over the city. The setting is perfect, with tables at the edge the Ormesini canal, and the savvy owner, Alessandro Biscontin, has moored a boat alongside as a floating terrace and impromptu venue for live jazz concerts. Occasionally tourists reserve tables for dinner, but this is a quintessentially Venetian locale, with most people drinking <em>spritz al bitter</em> or one of a fine selection of regional wines by the glass, and snacking on tempting <em>cichett</em>i such as grilled zucchini with pecorino cheese, smoked ricotta and roughly chopped tomatoes drizzled with olive oil, or radicchio topped with gorgonzola, mascarpone and walnuts. <br>\u2022 <em>Fondamenta degli Ormesini, +39 041 524 6066</em></p> <h2>Old World Bookshop</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395373961\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/24/1345817977186/Old-World-Bookshop-Venice-008.jpg\" alt=\"Old World Bookshop, Venice\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Old World Bookshop, Venice Photograph: John Brunton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tucked next to a narrow bridge in the heart of Venice's historic Jewish ghetto, Old World Books is a goldmine of rare books on Venice and Italy, run by eccentric Englishman John Francis Phillimore. Books are in English and Italian, ranging from little-known 16th-century editions to secondhand copies of the latest Donna Leon, sometimes signed by the author herself, who lives nearby. You never quite know who you'll bump into here \u2013 visiting poets, philosophers, artists \u2013 because John Francis also runs the Casa delle Parole, an active literary society, which sponsors <a href=\"http://www.vapoesia.com\" title=\"\">Vapoesia</a>, a series of eye-catching poems regularly exhibited on the <em>vaporettos</em> (water buses).<br>\u2022 <em>Campo Ghetto Vecchio</em></p> <h2>Dodo Caff\u00e8</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395373962\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/24/1345815904833/Dodo-Caffe-Venice-010.jpg\" alt=\"Dodo Caffe, Venice\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dodo Caffe, Venice Photograph: John Brunton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the ultimate locals' haunt, from the first building workers who stop off for a <em>caff\u00e8 coretto con grappa</em> at 7.30am, to mums enjoying an espresso after the school run, grizzled regulars who wander up and down the canal all day, going from bar to bar, and those enjoying the ritual of an early evening <em>aperitivo</em> as the sun begins to set. Dodo himself is a great personality, and he and lively barmaid Cristina make probably the best \u2013 and most lethal \u2013 <em>spritz al bitter</em> in town. The bar closes early, at around 9pm, but next door the partying carries on late at the funky Profondo Rosso bar, whose owner, Fifo, doubles as a DJ, while just across the bridge is La Bagatela, open till 1am and serving food well after midnight. <br>\u2022 <em>Fondamenta degli Ormesini, </em><a href=\"http://www.dodocaffe.it\" title=\"\"><em>dodocaffe.it</em></a><em> </em></p> <h2>10 Metri Quadrati</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395373963\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/24/1345814714956/10-Metri-Quadrati-bar-Ven-010.jpg\" alt=\"10 Metri Quadrati bar, Venice\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">10 Metri Quadrati bar, Venice Photograph: John Brunton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The latest hotspot to open in the neighbourhood, this buzzing bar has become an immediate hit with locals and tourists alike, and is worth visiting soon before it gets discovered by bloggers and guidebooks. The interior \u2013 small but not as tiny as the claimed \"10 Square Metres\" \u2013 is more Milan than Venice: sleek white minimalist decor contrasting with wooden beams, and modern art exhibitions decorating the walls. everyone wants a table looking out over the busy Canale di Cannaregio, where there is a nonstop parade of vaporetti, <em>motoscafi (</em>water taxis) and hefty cargo boats chugging past. Apart from the usual spritz, barman Giuliano mixes an array of cocktails, from the classic Martini to exotic fresh fruit mojitos. The bar stays open till well after midnight and serves salads, tasty grilled panini and plates of <em>affetati</em>, sliced ham, salami and local cheeses. <br>\u2022 <em>Fondamenta di Cannaregio, +39 041 713241</em></p> <h2>Anice Stellato</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395373964\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/24/1345814879068/Anice-Stellato-Venice-010.jpg\" alt=\"Anice Stellato, Venice\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anice Stellato, Venice Photograph: John Brunton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One canal over from the buzzing Ormesini neighbourhood, is this elegant restaurant, out on sleepy Fondamenta della Sensa. Reservations are a necessity as the creative cuisine of the husband and wife chefs has gained a serious reputation, and the place always seems to be fully booked. The menu is a tempting mix of <em>cucina della mamma</em> recipes with original twists, such as <em>scampi in saor profumati allo zenzero</em> \u2013 similar to the traditional s<em>arde in saor</em>, but using plump shrimps instead of sardines and adding a zing with grated ginger \u2013 or tortellini stuffed with <em>baccal\u00e0</em> (salt cod) and chickpeas, smothered with lightly fried courgette flowers. To walk off lunch, two landmark churches are just nearby, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sant%27Alvise\" title=\"\">Sant'Alvise</a>, with three splendid paintings by Tiepolo, and the towering <a href=\"http://www.madonnadellorto.org/\" title=\"\">Madonna dell'Orto</a>, parish church of Tintoretto. <br>\u2022 <em>Fondamenta della Sensa, +39 041 720744</em></p> <h2>Malefatte Boutique</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395373965\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/24/1345817878976/Malefatte-Boutique-Venice-008.jpg\" alt=\"Malefatte Boutique, Venice\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malefatte Boutique, Venice Photograph: John Brunton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shopping in Venice often does not go further than Murano glass, Fortuny lamps and carnival masks, but the intrepid fashionista that tracks down Malefatte in Cannaregio will discover one of the Serenissima's most original boutiques. This is the main store in Venice run by <a href=\"http://www.rioteradeipensieri.org\" title=\"\">Rio Tera dei Pensieri</a>, a work-in-jail cooperative that promotes products made by prisoners in the city's male and female jails. You can pick up beauty products, hand-sewn leather notebooks and sketchpads and its latest hot seller, a series of Freitag-inspired canvas bags at bargain prices. The most popular purchases, though, are their distinctive silk-screen T-shirts and shopping bags graphically imprinted with the Spritz logo. <br>\u2022 <em>Calle Zancan, </em><a href=\"http://www.rioteradeipensieri.org\" title=\"\"><em>rioteradeipensieri.org</em></a></p> <h2>Osteria Al Bacco</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395373966\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/24/1345815052685/Osteria-Al-Bacco-Venice-010.jpg\" alt=\"Osteria Al Bacco, Venice\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Osteria Al Bacco, Venice Photograph: John Brunton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bacco is one of Cannaregio's hidden secrets, tucked away so far along the quiet Canal delle Capuzine that few tourists discover it by chance. But it is one of the most ancient <em>osterie</em> in Venice. This is the place to spend the evening enjoying a long romantic meal, from the seafood antipasti of shrimps, anchovies and baby octopus to spaghetti cooked with black ink squid, freshly grilled sea bass or a plate piled high with a <em>fritto misto</em> of Adriatic seafood. A few tables line the canal outside and the garden is covered with a giant 120-year-old vine, but the best spot is inside the cosy wood-panelled dining room. Roberto Meneghetti is a laid-back host, but on certain evenings he may put on his favourite tango music and wheel one of the customers round the restaurant. Dinner will set you back \u20ac40-\u20ac50, but there is a well-priced set lunch at \u20ac13.<br>\u2022 <em>Fondamenta Capuzine, +39 041 721415 </em></p> <h2>Cantina Azienda Agricola</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395373967\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/24/1345815773645/Cantina-Azienda-Agricole--010.jpg\" alt=\"Cantina Azienda Agricole, Venice\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cantina Azienda Agricole, Venice Photograph: John Brunton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is easy to walk straight past this hole-in-the-wall bar, but once inside, you'll find the atmosphere is more like a private social club, filled with raucous locals moaning about politics, football and tourists \u2013 though everyone is made welcome, especially by the friendly host, Roberto di Berti, who has been running the place for 35 years. This is an authentic <em>bacaro</em>, the Venetian dialect term for inn, where a glass of the excellent house wine is 90 cents, and the tempting <em>cichetti </em>on the counter cost \u20ac1.50 and are made using the finest regional products \u2013 sopressa salami, prosciutto, asiago and montasio cheeses. This is an all-standing bar \u2013 no tables or chairs \u2013 and Roberto also has an extensive cellar with around 150 wines to take away, from renowned local producers such as Sirch, Pieropan and Livio Felluga. <br>\u2022 <em>Rio Tera' Farsetti, Closes 9pm</em></p> <h2>Bentigodi</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395373968\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/24/1345815261760/Bentigodi-Venice-010.jpg\" alt=\"Bentigodi, Venice\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bentigodi, Venice Photograph: John Brunton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This venerable osteria, at the entrance into the ghetto, has just been taken over by flamboyant Calabrian chef Domenico Iacuzio, who has immediately turned back the clock to when Bentigodi was both an obligatory stop-off for locals on their daily <em>giro d'ombra</em>, or bar crawl, and for foodies looking for a gourmet dinner. Domenico has filled the dining room with his favourite black-and-white photos of Gina Lollabrigida, Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren, as well the lucky giant yellow cash register that follows him every time he changes restaurant. A glass of wine and a tasty <em>polpetta (</em>meatball) will still only cost \u20ac2-\u20ac3, at the crowded counter, and his menu spans Venetian favourites like <em>insalata di polpo</em> (octopus salad) to <em>raviolo di burrata al pomodoro e basilico</em> (with mozzarella, tomato and basil) from his native south Italy.

You sit right on the busy drag, between the train station and the Rialto bridge, and there is a non-stop stream of tourists heading for the sights, and Venetians now living on the mainland getting to and from work. The Rio Ter\u00e0 is filled with stalls \u2013 masks and tacky souvenirs, but also fruit and veg. While there is a <em>men\u00f9 turistico</em>, locals prefer to come at noon when the dish of the day, usually a delicious risotto, comes out of the kitchen steaming hot. This place also offers some of the traditional cichetti that few bacari prepare today \u2013 <em>milza</em>, skewers of pork spleen, and <em>nervetti</em>, veal tendons with onions and vinegar. <br>\u2022 <em>Rio Tera San Leonardo, +39 041 716170</em></p>",
  "<p>Here's my story: I dropped out of A-levels about 12 years ago. At the time, I was content not to go to university: I was sick of being poor and I wanted a job. I began work as an office junior at a financial advice firm.</p> <p>However, several years later and still doing that sort of work, I found myself increasingly miserable and bored. So I began an evening \"access to university\" course in humanities at the City Lit college in London.</p> <p>I wasn't thinking about a change of career \u2013 I thought all I needed was a sense of achievement. And when I applied to go to Queen Mary University to read English, it was mostly just to see if I could get in.</p> <p>But studying there opened my eyes. I realised I could never be happy in my job. I was a useless financial services administrator, and the financial services sector left me cold. I had to change my career. After graduating, I completed a postgraduate certificate in journalism at Birkbeck, University of London.</p> <p>Rather naively, I at first assumed my degree plus my previous work experience would be enough to make the transition from administrator to copy writer.</p> <p>However, the recession and high unemployment means an internship has become a necessary step to realising my goal.</p> <p>I feel a million years old. And I've never heard of an intern over the age of 21, let alone 30. Can you have a mature intern?</p> <p>David Winter of C2, part of <a href=\"http://www.careers.lon.ac.uk/output/Page19.asp\" title=\"\">the Careers Group</a> at University of London, admits: \"You may find people who look at you with suspicion as a mature student trying to get an internship.\"</p> <p>Suspicion? This is subject matter ripe for the Hollywood rom-com: you know the genre \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0322330/\" title=\"\">Freaky Friday</a> or Jack Black in teenage masquerade trying to pull a teacher.</p> <p>Suspicion at best, I'm thinking. More likely ridicule. Actually, there's no tangible evidence for either. Neil Sandy, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.truestone.co.uk\" title=\"\">Truestone Asset Management</a> tells me: \"We would love to employ a mature intern, as we believe they have would much to offer the company. However, so far, we have yet to receive an application.\"</p> <p>Advertising agency <a href=\"http://www.bmbagency.com/\" title=\"\">Beattie McGuinness Bungay</a> have gone a step further, offering placements to non-graduates, for reasons Alex Brown, head of talent, explains: \"We've always believed in trying to find and attract the very best new talent to the advertising industry, irrespective of educational background. Our scheme opens its doors to grads and and non-grads.</p> <p>\"We have found that the non-grads are often over 25. They may be looking for a complete career change or they have experience in related industries and are looking to bring those skills to a more creative environment.\"</p> <p>Twenty percent of BMB interns are \"mature\". But BMB is in the minority: most major companies still pluck young graduates straight from university.</p> <p>According to Ucas figures, <a href=\"http://www.ucas.ac.uk/about_us/media_enquiries/media_releases/2012/20120531\" title=\"\">24% of those applying for university in 2012 are mature students</a> (see table 4). Clearly, this figure does not correlate with the number of mature students currently benefitting from company internships.</p> <p>David Winter offers the following advice: \"Be prepared to explain how your life experience has given you the ability and confidence to deal with situations relevant to your new career area that someone who has gone straight from school to university would find harder to tackle.\"</p> <p>All this reminds me of how I felt starting university at 26. I was anxious. I didn't really want to get smashed at a foam party and try my luck with the university rugby team, did I? At my age? Of course I did.</p> <p>Internships should be no different. With some luck, I may exorcise the demon of Freaky Friday \u2013 and establish a clear trajectory to my chosen career.</p>",
  "<p><strong>1. Don't make credit management subordinate to sales</strong></p> <p>Make sure the incentives you give to your sales team take credit into account and do not allow sales to overrule the people in charge of credit management. In very small businesses the two roles may not be distinct, but even as a sole trader you should still try to think twice about each prospective sale: once wearing a \"sales hat\" and once wearing a \"credit hat'.</p> <p><strong>2. Treat credit management as an enabler of sales, not an obstacle</strong></p> <p>The role of credit management should be to help you figure out a set of conditions under which you can say yes to selling on credit to each individual customer. Knowing as much as possible about the creditworthiness and payment habits of your customers, through a strong relationship and the use of credit information, can even help you win business by rewarding prompt payers.</p> <p><strong>3. Develop a well-defined credit policy and stick to it.</strong></p> <p>It doesn't have to be hundreds of pages long, or even a written document. Your policy does, however, have to be clear about when you are willing to give credit, how much and who to, as well as when exactly you will consider a payment to be overdue. Your policy must be known to all of your customer-facing staff and communicated in writing before each sale. When circumstances change, update the policy, don't overrule it. Most businesses treat big customers differently and that's fine, as long as you still have policies for those.</p> <p><strong>4. See the big picture</strong></p> <p>If you sell on credit, you are someone's banker, so think like one. Giving credit is as much a part of your business as getting orders; a profit on paper may quickly turn into a loss after you add to your costs the cost of financing your working capital, chasing up late payments, and absorbing non-payment. Try to have a good idea at all times of what that cost is.</p> <p><strong>5. Be organised about invoicing and collections</strong></p> <p>The invoicing and collections process turns promises into cash; don't leave it to chance. Set up a routine for invoicing and collections (including polite reminders before the money is due) and stick to it. Some customers look out for signs of disorganisation and use them to determine which suppliers they can get away with paying late; individuals may even use them in order to rationalise the fact that they're paying you late. Make sure you don't present yourself as the easiest or most deserving target.</p> <p><strong>6. Know your customer</strong></p> <p>Make sure you understand your customers' payment process and the systems they use, and if possible get to know the individuals dealing with invoices. Ensure your invoices are designed to fit into their way of working. Some customers, especially large ones, will have no incentive to streamline their processes precisely because a convoluted payment process will allow them to pay late.</p> <p><strong>7. Know your rights</strong></p> <p>The law gives you as a supplier the ability to charge interest on overdue payments; you can calculate this using an <a href=\"http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.i=1073792170&amp;r.l1=1073858790&amp;r.l2=1074453392&amp;r.l3=1074002362&amp;r.t=RESOURCES&amp;topicId=1080465982\" title=\"\">online tool</a> hosted on Business Link. This is easier said than done, but it's still useful to clarify, in writing, that you reserve the right to charge interest. Some suppliers even do this automatically when debts become overdue, and invoice their customers for the additional interest right away. The point of this is rarely to actually receive the extra money, but rather to jolt customers into paying on time.</p> <p><strong>8. Invest in professional credit management</strong></p> <p>With credit management, having good staff really does make a difference. As soon as you are able to, make sure finance or credit staff receive training in credit management, or that you hire staff who already have.</p> <p><em>Manos Schizas is senior SME policy adviser at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Her dad is a bridge teacher, her mum an artist, and to make ends meet she moonlights by holding songwriting workshops in London secondary schools.</p> <p>Hopefully, the success of her music \u2013 produced by her collaborator and multi-instrumentalist Stefano Della Casa \u2013 will soon preclude the need for extra employment; it is certainly attracting all the right attention, from all the right radio stations and magazines. Scott is especially proud of her track Days of Wine and its lyric: \"In praise of chaos, in praise of love lost, to salvage order, to break the deadlock/ In praise of conflict and all we forfeit, rekindle laughter till we've restored it.\" She wrote it in the aftermath of a ruined relationship. In Praise of Chaos, she explains, will be her debut album title. \"You don't normally hear words like that coming out of a twentysomething female's mouth,\" she says. The relationship sounds pretty messy.</p> <p>On the love song Still Static, Scott addresses a woman. \"I wouldn't have dared say 'she' before but now I think, 'Fuck it.'\" She admits to having been a bit nervous singing the song at the <a href=\"http://www.greenbelt.org.uk\" title=\"\">Greenbelt festival</a>, and joins us in marvelling at the fact that, still today, an artist can cause a furore in coming out, be it in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jul/04/frank-ocean-courage-come-out\" title=\"\">world of hip-hop</a>, or folk \u2013 sorry, acoustic pop. If it was folk, <a href=\"http://www.shewired.com/box-office/top-10-gay-girl-wishes-lilith-fair-2010\" title=\"\">there might be less fuss</a>, but actually now that we think of it, maybe it would seem unusual, still, for a woman to address another woman in a song, on daytime radio.</p> <p>Make no mistake, these songs <em>are</em> built for radio, from Only Way Out and Your Lullaby to the lilting Still Static and Days of Wine. Her \"transitions\" get special praise from commenters on SoundCloud, and we're not even going to mention the Cranberries, pausing instead to note a vague resemblance to the fine <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jul/13/new-band-stealing-sheep\" title=\"\">Stealing Sheep</a> only without the psychedelic inflections. Meanwhile, Scott is confident she won't be running out of things to write about anytime soon.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Packed with lyrically intelligent songs and her highly distinctive voice\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.adventureswithwords.com/post/23240935668/how-do-you-write-lyrics-with-hannah-scott\" title=\"\">adventureswithwords.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> She reduces women and children to tears \u2013 in a good way.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Moonlight.</p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> Sunbathe.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> The Still Static EP is out now.

  "<p><strong>\"With the first Premier League matches ticked off my list, an old sinking feeling revisited me as I realised that, again, the league would not be dazzled/enriched by the presence of at least one Indian/Indian-origin player,\" </strong>writes Vivek. <strong>\"That hurts even more in light of the fact that Zimbabwe (Benjani Mwaruwari), Honduras (Wilson Palacios, etc), and other smaller countries have had their players ply their trade in the Premier League, but not India. This got me thinking \u2013 apart from India, is there another country that has never been represented in the Premier League by its players? Conversely, which countries (England notwithstanding) have contributed the most players?\"</strong></p> <p>Cheer up Vivek, you're far from alone. By our count well over 100 countries, from Afghanistan to Yemen via El Salvador and Liechtenstein, of the 209 listed in the Fifa world rankings have failed to produce Premier League footballers.</p> <p>And India are by some distance not the highest-ranked country without a Premier League player to their name. That honour goes to Libya at No38 in Fifa's world rankings. Venezuela \u2013 No52 \u2013 and Panama \u2013 No54 \u2013 are next up. You have go all the way down to No168 in the world to find India.</p> <p>In terms of population and size India doesn't fare quite as well, being both the biggest and most populous country to have failed to churn out a Premier League player. Indonesia, No4 on the population list, and Kazakhstan, world No9 in terms of size, are India's nearest rivals in those regards. When it comes to GDP per capita, however, Qatar and Luxembourg are the countries who come of worst. Or best. Depending on your point of view.</p> <p>At the other end of the scale, the Republic of Ireland have produced far more Premier League players than any other country outside of the UK. Second on the list, again by some distance from third-placed Holland, is France.</p> <h2>COMING SECOND</h2> <p><strong>\"How many times since the European Cup/Champions League allowed non-champions entry has it been won by those non-champions?\"</strong> wonders Stephen Farrell.</p> <p>In the 15 editions of the Champions League since a few runners-up were first admitted in 1997-98, the trophy has been lifted six times by teams who qualified without winning their domestic championship. The first to do so were Manchester United in 1998-99 (Arsenal had won the Premier League in 1997-98) and it was achieved most recently by Chelsea last season (Manchester United having won the league title in 2010-11. In between Real Madrid in 1999-2000 (the 1998-98 La Liga was won by Barcelona), Milan in 2002-03 (Serie A was won by Juventus in 2001-02), Liverpool in 2004-05 (the 2003-04 Premier League was won by Arsenal) and Barcelona in 2008-09 (La Liga in 2007-08 was won by Real Madrid) have all benefited from Uefa's decision not to take the name of the Champions League too literally.</p> <p>However, twas ever thus. Before 1997-98, seven sides won the European Cup without having won their domestic league titles the previous season, the clubs re-entering the competition to retain the title having won it the year previously. Real Madrid in 1956-57 (in 1955-56 La Liga was won by Athletic Bilbao), Real again in 1959-60 (the 1958-59 La Liga was won by Barcelona), Internazionale in 1964-65 (Serie A won by Bologna in 1963-64), Ajax in 1971-72 (the 1970-71 Eredivisie was won by Feyenoord), Bayern Munich in 1975-76 (the 1974-75 Bundesliga was won by Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, while Bayern famously finished 10th), Nottingham Forest in 1979-80 (Liverpool won the First Division in 1978-79) and lastly Milan in 1989-90 (the 1988-89 Serie A having been won by Inter).</p> <h2>THE WAITING ROOM</h2> <p><strong>\"I heard from a mate that no Bury player has scored a hat-trick this millennium,\" </strong>begins Liam Corte. <strong>\"I laughed this off as an obviously made-up stat, but I then went through Bury's results and it seems to be true: No one has done it since Ian Lawson in August 1999. That's got to be some sort of record, surely?\"</strong></p> <p>\"Although Arturo Lupli has managed a league cup hat-trick since,\" begins Ed Gilbert, \"Derby County have the dubious distinction of having no league hat-trick since <a href=\"http://youtu.be/mvQMhY0RZyc\" title=\"\">Paul Simpson on 7 April 1996</a>.\"</p> <p>Has your club waited longer?

So let's allow Neil Jackson to get the formalities out of the way: \"On his return to St James's Park after being sold to Spurs, Gazza was pelted with Mars bars by the Gallowgate end,\" recalls Neil. \"I think he'd professed a liking for them in an interview. During the game, in full 'daft as a brush' mode, he picked one up, opened it and took an enormous bite.\"</p> <p>Then there was the time in 2000 when Hull City fans decided to protest against David Lloyd, the former tennis player, then GB Davis Cup chief and owner of Boothferry Park. \"He had threatened to close the club down and called the people of the city 'crap',\" explains Richard Gardham, \"all because he hadn't realised the ground he'd bought had a supermarket built on to it with a 99-year lease that scuppered his development plans. To protest, loads of Hull fans interrupted a match by pelting the pitch with tennis balls. Apparently, Mr Lloyd didn't see the funny side.\"</p> <p>But really, when it comes to the strangest object ever thrown from the terraces, there is, as dozens of you have pointed out, only one winner: the scooter that Internazionale supporters stole from an Atalanta fan outside San Siro in May 2001, then smuggled into the stadium (past rigorous security checks, clearly), set on fire and tossed from the second tier on to a thankfully empty section of the lower stand. OK, so the scooter didn't actually make it on to the pitch, but that was the intention.</p> <p><em>For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/series/theknowledge\" title=\"\"><em>the Knowledge archive</em></a></p> <h2>Can you help?</h2> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.flashscores.co.uk/match/rmfsXbiU/?of=uk#match-summary\" title=\"\">31-0?

  "<p><strong>Q</strong> My partner of eight years (we weren't married) left me after his second affair and he moved out 13 months ago. My home is mine: the mortgage is in my name and I had owned it for three years before we met. The only bill he ever had his name on was council tax. He did, however, give me a monthly amount which paid for his share of the bills and food, most household items, trips out and holidays. We have no kids together, although my own teenagers live in the house with me.</p> <p>Now after an absence of 13 months and no payments from him he wants me to give him what he calls \"his share\" of the equity in my house. My most pressing argument is that I have battled for more than a year to successfully pay my mortgage while he has contributed nothing. If I had paid nothing for 13 months the bank would now own my house. Surely, then, he cannot do this? <strong>DC</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> No, your ex cannot claim a share of your home, and that's not just because he hasn't helped pay the mortgage for the past 13 months. According to Vicki McLynn, an expert in family law at Manchester-based solicitors Pannone LLP, your ex would need to show that you had intended him to have an interest in your property, which given what you say you clearly didn't. The onus would be on your ex to prove his case, which would be a pretty tall order and extremely difficult for him to do.</p>",

Also, it's easy to forget how Motorola sued Apple first (and how Motorola threatened to sue other Android OEMs shortly before being acquired by Google), or how HTC subsidiary S3 Graphics sued Apple first.

The political press will look at the soft voice, the perfect appearance, the unnamed examples of struggling Americans, the punctuating giggles, and just roll their eyes and conclude it must be some 1950s television image reheated and served up for today.</p> <p>But for the millions of Americans who'd had little or no <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/28/republican-national-convention-2012-live\">exposure to Ann Romney before Tuesday night</a>, it was a home run: a warm, personal speech and an extremely effective introduction. The vast majority of the electorate hits the channel-changer at the first string of numbers and percentages, but when Ann Romney says, \"the price at the pump you can't believe \u2026 School sports are now an extra fee. Everything has become harder \u2026\" it's on a personal scale and extremely effective.</p> <p>You would love to have the Romneys as neighbors. She would be having you over all the time. He might seem a little stiff, and the dinner parties never had any booze, but you knew you could trust them and she would always seem happy to see you. </p> <p>In other news: sometime in the not distant future, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/28/artur-davis-speech-_n_1831712.html\">former Alabama Congressman Artur Davis</a>, a Democrat-turned-Republican, is going to run for office \u2013 perhaps one of the House seats outside Washington in northern Virginia, probably the seat of Representative Gerry Connolly. Based on how intensely, humorously, and powerfully he made the case for Romney to disappointed independents and Democrats, he will have a <em>lot</em> of Republicans eager to help him out, from high-dollar donors to grassroots conservatives.</p> <p>The opening of Christie's speech was more \"Jersey\" than eating a pretzel with giant salt crystals while coming out of Giants Stadium after watching the Jets lose a late-season game, hearing Bruce Springsteen blasting from a Camaro driven by a long-haired guy smoking a cigarette, seeing the Secaucus swamp beyond \u2026 I'm sorry, I got a little lost on memory lane there. Bottom line: it was really, really New Jersey.</p> <p>The line and theme \"respect over love\" was an interesting angle to take. If Ann Romney's speech was about love, Christie's was about tough love, about demanding more from politicians. One of the most effective lines was declaring that any suggestion from a politician that problems can be solved without sacrifice is a lie. Obama talks about his tax hikes on the richest Americans, but insists that all of his agenda \u2013 his jobs plan, enacting Obamacare, debt control \u2013 will not ask more of Americans.</p> <p>Of course, now Romney's convention address is forced to acknowledge some of these hard truths that voters are reluctant to hear.</p> <p>You know which two words didn't come up very often in Christie's speech? \"Mitt Romney\". I counted five references, all towards the end. It was an OK speech for the interests of the nominee, a solid speech for the interests of the party \u2026 and a fantastic speech for the interests of Chris Christie.</p> <p><em>Jim Geraghty is a contributing editor to the National Review</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ana-marie-cox\">Ana Marie Cox</a>: 'Christie wanted to evoke the GOP as the enforcer'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395478588\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/28/1317225418768/Annmarie_Cox.jpg\" alt=\"Ana Marie Cox\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The Republicans counter-programmed themselves tonight: the speeches of Ann Romney and Chris Christie bore superficial resemblances to each other (hits on Obama, plaudits for moms), but taken together, they suggest the dissonance that's haunted the GOP since the primaries began.</p> <p>Ann Romney's speech asked people to consider Mitt as a family man and private person. She told us, \"Tonight, I want to talk to you about love.\" </p> <p>Chris Christie took tenderness and crushed it in one meaty paw, delivering a sideways knock at Obama's perceived neediness at the same time:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I believe we have been paralyzed with our desire to be loved.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Ann Romney wanted us to think about the Republican party as empathetic to the needs of working people, for whom \"the last few years have been harder than they needed to be.\" (True enough, though her evocation of a golden time when school sports \"used to be free\" had me checking the calendar to see which decade I was in for this convention.) </p> <p>Christie, meanwhile, wanted to evoke the GOP as the enforcer: it is become Death, destroyer of unions! Most notably, Ann Romney talked about Mitt. Christie \u2026 not so much.</p> <p>Of the two, it was Ann Romney's speech that may prove to have the less sustainable narrative, in part because of its internal inconsistencies. She can reference college days filled with tuna bake and desks made out of sawhorses all she wants, but now, she has a car elevator and all her horses do dressage. That isn't an American success story, it's privilege finding its own level.</p> <p>Christie's speech, Romney-free as it was, presented the GOP not just as it wants to be seen, but as it is right now: brusque, glib, in love with the sound of its own voice and talking about tough choices from the cushiest seat in the house.</p> <p><em>Ana Marie Cox is US political columnist for the Guardian</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesantle\">James Antle</a>: 'Christie's speech seemed like an audition for his own presidential campaign'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395478589\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/05/27/james_antle_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"James Antle\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When the candidate's wife is introduced at a fundraiser, many superlatives are applied. Sometimes, they're jokes \u2013 she's my campaign treasurer! In Ann Romney's case, top campaign surrogate shouldn't be a punchline; it should be her full-time role.</p> <p>Mitt Romney comes across as cold and robotic. His wife is warm, charming and skilful at a difficult task: humanizing the Republican nominee. Her delivery was effective, her frequents bouts of laughter made it seem like she was having fun, and she subtly pushed back against the \"war on women\" narrative favored by the left.</p> <p>If the speech had downsides, it was probably overdoing the tuna noodle casserole bit \u2013 Romney did indeed build that, but he never was exactly poor \u2013 and the conclusion, which seemed to compare electing a president to going out on a date.</p> <p>If Ann Romney was maternal, Chris Christie was paternal \u2013 despite his moving tribute to his mother. He also appeared to contradict Mrs Romney's emphasis on love, saying it is better to be respected. But he rallied the troops well and made the case for difficult budget cuts in layman's terms.</p> <p>His attack on leaders who want to be cool and popular, always saying yes, when the right answer is no, was a not-too-subtle slap at President Obama. But the speech went on too long and started to lose focus toward the end. Ultimately, with its focus on his record in New Jersey, Christie's speech seemed more like an audition for his own presidential campaign.</p> <p>In other news, remember the name <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/08/28/republican-convention-to-feature-rising-star-mia-love/\">Mia Love</a>.</p> <p><em>James Antle is editor of the Daily Caller News Foundation</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/michael-cohen\">Michael Cohen</a>: 'Consistency or truth were not much in evidence at Tampa'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395478590\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2011/8/6/1312655160523/Michael-Cohen-003.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Cohen\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Cohen Photograph: Observer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So, in the primetime hour of Tuesday night's Republican National Convention, there was something of an odd juxtaposition.

Not a lot of consistency there, but then, fealty to consistency or truth were not much in evidence last night in Tampa.</p> <p>Indeed, the first two hours of the convention began with speaker after speaker riffing off President Obama's statement \"you didn't build that\" \u2013 a sentence that was uttered in reference to how government can help entrepreneurship prosper, but has become, in the hands of Republican partisans, a shorthand for the president's supposed assault on the free market in America. Quite simply, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/26/mitt-romney/putting-mitt-romneys-attacks-you-didnt-build-truth/\">it's a lie</a>; but it's one that Republicans seem intent on repeating for all that it is worth.</p> <p>Yet, the \"you didn't build that\" line, while the most repeated and most stunningly dishonest, was hardly the only misleading statement of the evening. Instead, a cavalcade of misinformation defined the first day of the 2012 RNC. Republicans trotted out the charge that Obama had gutted welfare (he hasn't); that Obamacare puts government bureaucrats between patients and doctors (he doesn't); that Obama called Americans \"bumps in the road\" (he didn't); that he is responsible for creating $5tn in debt (Congress and the recession also had something to do with that).</p> <p>And yet, none of this stopped Christie from describing the Republican party and its nominee, Mitt Romney, as the ones who will tell the American people honest truths about the challenges facing America.</p> <p>Bottom line: it's gonna be a long couple of days here in Florida.</p> <p><em>Michael Cohen is a US political columnist for the Observer and Guardian</em></p>"
