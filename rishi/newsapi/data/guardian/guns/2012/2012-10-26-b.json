  "<p>In 2006, the year before the financial crisis started, BBC2 broadcast a luxurious adaptation of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/lineofbeauty/about.shtml\" title=\"\">The Line of Beauty</a>, Alan Hollinghurst's heady novel about rich Britain in the mid-80s. In the Observer, Tim Adams, who had been a young adult in the heyday of Thatcherism, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/apr/23/broadcasting.film\" title=\"\">wrote a perceptive essay</a> about the feelings the programme and book provoked. For some of the people who had read the novel on his recommendation, \"certainly those a few&#xa0;years younger than me,\" he wrote, the \"moral shifts Hollinghurst was concerned with no longer had the power&#xa0;to shock. They had grown up with nothing else but 80s values.\" Adams concluded: \"The point about the 80s is that they have never finished.\"</p> <p>In 2010, the Labour prime minister who did so much to ensure this, Tony Blair, argued in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/11/journey-tony-blair-alistair-darling\" title=\"\">his autobiography, A&#xa0;Journey</a>, that there were good reasons for Thatcherism's continued hold on Britain. \"Much of what she wanted to&#xa0;do&#xa0;in the 1980s was inevitable, a consequence not of ideology but of social and economic change.\" In many ways, he wrote, \"Mrs Thatcher was absolutely on the side of history.\"</p> <p>It feels less like that now. Some of the most obvious cracks in the supremacy of&#xa0;the 80s have appeared where Thatcherism was supposedly strongest: on the economy. Home ownership, central to her popular capitalism, peaked in the United Kingdom in 2003.&#xa0;In England, it has been declining for two years longer: the National Housing Federation <a href=\"http://www.housing.org.uk/?page=2319\" title=\"\">predicted last year</a>&#xa0;that by 2021 owner-occupancy will&#xa0;be back to mid-80s levels.</p> <p>In the privatised utilities, 80s dreams of consumer empowerment, choice and value have also soured. Ten days ago, David Cameron's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/18/energy-minister-tariffs-row-deepens\" title=\"\">hasty, misfiring announcement about energy prices</a> tacitly acknowledged this: his supposedly free-market government was planning to legislate to make energy&#xa0;companies offer their customers their cheapest tariffs.</p> <p>The economy as a whole was supposedly revitalised for the long term&#xa0;by Thatcherism. It has not quite worked out like that. Thursday's announcement of a single quarter of growth after one of the most protracted ever modern recessions was greeted with almost desperate relief \u2013 \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/25/uk-emerges-from-double-dip-recession-george-osborne?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">the economy is healing</a>\" \u2013 by the chancellor George Osborne. Probably closer to the&#xa0;current mood of many voters and economists was <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/labours-new-agenda\" title=\"\">a speech last month</a> by the Labour leader Ed Miliband. He said that, in the 80s, \"A set of [economic] assumptions emerged \u2026 A rising tide would lift all boats \u2026 Wealth would trickle down to&#xa0;all. And the rules governing our economy were unchangeable \u2026 All of these assumptions have been discredited by the events of the last five years.\"</p> <p>A lack of faith in the Thatcherite free&#xa0;market now extends far beyond the&#xa0;left. Last October was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/09/big-bang-1986-city-deregulation-boom-bust\" title=\"\">the 25th anniversary of the \"big bang\"</a> that deregulated the City of London. In the Daily Telegraph, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/8850654/Was-the-Big-Bang-good-for-the-City-of-London-and-Britain.html\" title=\"\">an even-handed article</a> by City historian David Kynaston prompted a long chain of reader comments whose recriminatory tone would have been unthinkable on previous anniversaries, but now seems quite normal. \"So many of us were taken in by Maggie Thatcher at the time,\" wrote marknewdarkage. \"I was a&#xa0;huge fan \u2026 But as time has gone by, I&#xa0;can see she has ruined so much of what&#xa0;was good about this country \u2026 It is going to take years and years before this mess is cleared up, if it ever will be.\"</p> <p>A similar sense of a country belatedly waking up to what happened in the 80s has hung over the News International phone-hacking scandal, which may enter a new phase next month with the&#xa0;publication of the Leveson inquiry report. Rupert Murdoch's influence over&#xa0;Britain did not start in the Thatcher era \u2013 he bought the News of the World in 1968, the Sun in 1969 \u2013 but it was in the 80s that it hardened into one of the central facts of political life, through his&#xa0;breaking of the printing unions, his&#xa0;purchase of the Times and Sunday Times in 1981, and the relentless rightwing crusading of those papers and&#xa0;the Sun. Three decades later, in July&#xa0;2011, to watch a slightly pasty, croaking, self-styled \"humble\" Murdoch appear before a televised committee of&#xa0;suddenly irreverent MPs was to see something dragged out into the light: a&#xa0;power relationship that would never be quite the same again. It was the first time he had ever faced direct scrutiny by British MPs.</p> <p>This autumn, an equally unexpected reckoning has begun about 80s policing. On Wednesday, Sir Norman Bettison, chief constable of West Yorkshire, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/24/hillsborough-disaster-norman-bettison-resigns\" title=\"\">abruptly resigned</a>, two days after being&#xa0;accused by Labour MP Maria Eagle&#xa0;of boasting that he had smeared Liverpool supporters following the&#xa0;1989&#xa0;Hillsborough disaster. Bettison&#xa0;denied the allegation, but his&#xa0;Hillsborough conduct is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). On Monday, the Commons heard that the names of a startling 1,444 former and serving police officers have been passed to the IPCC, which is also examining whether there was a criminal cover-up of the police actions at Hillsborough. According to the IPCC, it is the biggest-ever independent investigation into British police behaviour.</p> <p>In the 80s, many powerful people in Britain regarded football fans as nothing but hooligans, to be policed as robustly as possible. Liverpudlians sometimes attracted a similar contempt: their once grand, increasingly gaunt city was associated with riots, insubordinate leftwing councillors and unstoppable economic decline. The police fared rather differently as an interest group. At the first formal cabinet meeting after the election of the Thatcher government in&#xa0;1979, the first item was police pay: after years of slow growth, it was to increase immediately by 45%.</p> <p>A connection between the enhanced political status of the police in the 80s, the more militarised style of British policing that began then and the sometimes confrontational style of the&#xa0;Thatcher government has long been&#xa0;an article of faith for many on the British left. Last month, they gained an unlikely recruit in Jack Straw, the former Labour home secretary, not usually a liberal on law and order. He told the Today programme: \"The Thatcher government, because they needed the police to be a partisan force, particularly for the [1984-5] miners' strike and other industrial troubles, created a culture of&#xa0;impunity in the police service \u2026 They&#xa0;thought they could rule the roost, and that is what we absolutely saw in South Yorkshire.\"</p> <p>The South Yorkshire force policed Hillsborough and its aftermath. Five years earlier, in 1984, they also policed the attempted blockade of the nearby Orgreave coking plant by striking miners. Following \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/gallery/2009/feb/23/don-mcphee-miner-strike-photography\" title=\"\">the Battle of Orgreave</a>\", one of the most violent and&#xa0;infamous clashes of the Thatcher period, dozens of miners were prosecuted, then acquitted: police evidence against them, it was revealed, had been fabricated. This week, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01nj32j/Inside_Out_Yorkshire_and_Lincolnshire_22_10_2012/\" title=\"\">a BBC1 programme, Inside Out</a>, made further allegations about the faking of police statements at Orgreave, and the Labour party and the National Union of Mineworkers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/21/hillsborough-investigation-extend-orgreave-miners\" title=\"\">called for an inquiry</a>.</p> <p>Until recently, Orgreave, like much&#xa0;of&#xa0;the 80s, seemed increasingly like ancient history \u2013 all the more remote because the issues contested then seemed to have been settled, for good or&#xa0;ill. Each time the anniversary cycle came around, or new generations appeared of commissioning editors or&#xa0;writers or artists who had spent formative years in the 80s, the key events would be remembered, but rarely&#xa0;properly re-evaluated, let alone acknowledged as part of our present.</p> <p>Those that attempted the latter during the placid years of the Blair boom&#xa0;faced difficulties. In 2001, artist <a href=\"http://www.artangel.org.uk//projects/2001/the_battle_of_orgreave/about_the_project/the_battle_of_orgreave\" title=\"\">Jeremy Deller famously restaged Orgreave</a>, in well-researched detail, close to where it happened, using veterans from both sides. But for all the&#xa0;provocativeness of the idea and the moments of raw feeling it reportedly generated \u2013 \"you bastards, bastards, fascists\", Tom Lubbock of the Independent heard people shout from the watching crowd during \"the first mounted police charge\" \u2013 the event seemed to place Orgreave in a museum as much as bring it back to life. Two-thirds of the participants were actually from historic re-enactment societies, and ironising 80s pop hits played through a PA system at \"half time\". A&#xa0;fortnight earlier, Thatcher admirer Blair had been re-elected with another enormous majority. In 2001, raging against how the 80s continued to&#xa0;shape Britain felt like complaining about the weather.</p> <p>The fact that the 70s remained \u2013 and remain \u2013 widely reviled has also helped make 80s values seem impregnable. Recriminations about the British 70s, about their messy politics, their spluttering economy, their sleaziness, started well before&#xa0;the 70s had even ended. It was not hard subsequently to&#xa0;present the 80s as an improvement, or at worst, a&#xa0;painful but necessary corrective \u2013 \"inevitable\" in Blair's words. In many ways, the 80s are the&#xa0;right's sacred decade; and in the&#xa0;British media, and in&#xa0;how Britain talked about itself, in the&#xa0;three decades from the election of&#xa0;Thatcher to the election of Cameron, the right's ideas generally prevailed.</p> <p>Yet even the notion that the 80s represented an advance on the 70s' sometimes grisly sexual mores can be challenged. One of the many horrible aspects of the Jimmy Savile scandal is how his alleged assaults, seen initially by much of the media as emblematic 70s behaviour, seem to have continued well into the 80s and beyond.</p> <p>More quietly, generational shifts are eroding the 80s' electoral influence. Thatcher and the changes that occurred under her were rarely overwhelmingly popular. The British Social Attitudes survey showed leftward as well as rightward trends during the 80s; her share of the vote at&#xa0;general elections was middling by&#xa0;postwar standards; and her iron majorities were in large part the products of splits and weaknesses among her opponents. Nowadays, the beneficiaries of her booms, such pivotal interest groups in the Britain of the 90s and 00s, are beginning to be rivalled politically by those too young to have taken part. To some of this economically stressed generation, the postwar world she replaced \u2013 of state paternalism and strong unions, of municipal housing and more workplace protections \u2013 looks quite appealing, which is one of the reasons the 70s are beginning to be rehabilitated. Meanwhile, pessimists of all ages look at Britain now and wonder if we are back where we were in&#xa0;1979: economically vulnerable, unsure of our place in the world. Was all that 80s turbulence and toughening-up really worth it?</p> <p>Even British thinkers on the right are&#xa0;beginning to&#xa0;wonder. From Tory philosopher <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/phillipb\" title=\"\">Phillip Blond</a>'s attacks on&#xa0;\"individualism\", to Tory MP Jesse Norman's criticism of monopolistic \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/12/fsa-end-crony-capitalism\" title=\"\">crony capitalism</a>\", to Ferdinand Mount \u2013 once head of Thatcher's Downing Street policy unit \u2013 worrying about the concentration of wealth among \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/25/the-new-few-ferdinand-mount-review\" title=\"\">the new few</a>\", there is strengthening disquiet at some of the forces the 80s set in motion. There is also an emerging, little-noticed common ground with Labour's bolder social critics, such as the&#xa0;MP Jon Cruddas and Miliband himself. In 2011, the latter's party conference condemnation of free-market \"predators\" \u2013 some of the more&#xa0;sharkish characters in The Line of&#xa0;Beauty come to mind \u2013 was initially received on the right with bafflement and derision. Miliband's populist, timely&#xa0;argument gets more respect from&#xa0;some Conservatives now.</p> <p>How much of a reckoning about the&#xa0;80s will there ultimately be? What the police did then may never be fully exposed: Britain probes and punishes police excesses with extreme reluctance. The same may go for the bankers. The privatised utilities feel more vulnerable: even the rightwing papers routinely deride them. Murdoch's political dominance has surely gone. He&#xa0;is 82, and British politicians are unlikely ever to attend his parties like&#xa0;they used to.</p> <p>Thatcher herself has recently turned 87. At the TUC conference last month, T-shirts with a tombstone print and the words, \"A Generation of Trade Unionists Will Dance On Thatcher's Grave\", were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/11/thatcher-death-t-shirts-tuc\" title=\"\">briefly and controversially on sale</a>. Last December, when there was the latest round of speculation about whether she would receive a state funeral, even Thatcher-admiring commentator Peter Oborne argued in the Daily Telegraph that she was too divisive a figure.</p> <p>But I am not sure we should celebrate unreservedly if the 80s are written off as where it all went wrong. The 90s and 00s \u2013 the decades of complacency? \u2013 will be next. In an anxious country, the recent past is always to blame.</p>",
  "<p>There are many lessons to be learned from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/25/jimmy-savile-sexual-assault-complaints-alive\" title=\"\">the Jimmy Savile scandal</a>. One of the more simple ones, surely, is that celebrity shortens the arm of the law. Yet Scotland Yard has said to the media that it expects to arrest \"up to a dozen\" household names soon. What can this achieve, beyond providing chances to dump computers, hire a lawyer or get on a flight to Thailand?</p> <p>Part of the reason Savile and others were able to prey on young people with impunity was that their word was always considered more valuable than those of their victims. The point when sympathy for Peter Rippon, the man who halted the Newsnight investigation into Savile's crimes, evaporated was when it emerged that he'd dismissed the collaborative testimony of four of Savile's victims as \"just the women\", adding for good measure that, 40 years ago, 14 years old was \"not too young\" to be a girl in a special school, manipulated and bribed into sexually servicing a powerful man. How appalling.</p> <p>Such behaviour is utterly reprehensible, whatever age a preyed-upon person is. For under-16s, then as now, it is immoral and illegal. The age and gender of the people who complained about Savile was viewed, even last November, as somehow a mitigation of his behaviour, when those, along with his&#xa0;celebrity, were actually details that abetted him in both his exploitation and his ability to get away with it.</p> <p>These \"household names\" still have that advantage. And they've been tipped off that any day now, their advantage can be played once again. Britain's obsession with celebrity is beginning to look not just silly, but extremely dark, even evil.</p>",
  "<p>The main character in Dawn French's new novel says not a word for the entire book. It was, as she tells it \u2013 sitting on the other side of a long table in a high, white room, in central London, arms tightly folded across her chest \u2013 an entirely practical decision. She had discovered, after writing a memoir in the form of letters, and then a first novel in similar vein, that monologue is where she feels most comfortable. So the protagonist, Silvia, lies in a coma in a hospital bed, inert, while her family and friends sit by her, hoping to rouse her, and talk and talk and talk.</p> <p>Then, a few months into the process of writing the book, her own mother fell ill. \"It was the strangest thing \u2013 although in another way it was completely organic. Everything happened slowly. My mum was a bit poorly. Then she was very poorly, and I'd be writing a bit of Silvia, and then a bit more of Silvia. The central conceit was already well set \u2013 I knew exactly what was going to happen at the end, and all the rest of it \u2013 but then it was just strange to be in hospital a lot.\" Eventually, she and her brother were spending whole days and nights by her mother's bed. And \"there was a moment when my mum woke up, and she was very groggy, and I was just sitting there, watching her, and she said, 'Why aren't you writing?' And I said 'Because I'm here, with you?' And she said, 'Well, keep writing.' Because she knew what this book was about \u2013 she'd read those first bits.\" And so for days, French sat there with her mother, writing, looking, thinking, until her mother became too ill, and she couldn't any more, and laid it aside.</p> <p>There is a striking immediacy about this aspect of the novel in particular: the ablutions administered by the nurses, the smells, the artificial light, the fug and dream-state of day and night ceding to each other. It's an odd book: it lurches between registers, from earnest lyricism to broad farce, from persuasive psychological insight (some of the book is very moving) to swathes of ill-advised dialect and stereotype. It is obviously written with serious intent, both literary and thematically: she tackles the big ones \u2013 love, death, grief, childhood, motherhood, parenthood \u2013 head on, without resorting, as other comedians might, to the deflationary, distancing joke.</p> <p>She describes, for instance, the&#xa0;moment of shift from daughter to matriarch, as it becomes clear, in the novel, that Silvia will not waken. It was something she felt herself, as it became obvious that her own mother would not survive. \"I just felt, 'Oh, god. Because my dad had already died\" \u2013 he killed himself when she was 19 \u2013 \"I thought, 'Oh, god, I'm going to have to grow up.'\" A&#xa0;huge belly laugh. \"I'm going to be that person in the family, I'm going to be&#xa0;the matriarch.\"</p> <p>She is frank about the challenges at the other end of this line, too, with her own daughter, now 21 and testing her wings. \"She's at college, in the same county as me \u2013 far enough away to be in her own digs, but home every weekend, with a big pile of laundry, ready for Sunday lunch and a good row!\" Another huge belly laugh. \"You're very connected, but you mustn't control too much, you mustn't interfere too much. It's time for me to take my hands off the reins, but how do you know when to do that? You just kind of feel your way through it, and you war a little bit, all the way through \u2026 I have a theory that the reason you have the wars is so that the eventual tearing is not too unbearable. You'd die of sorrow, if you didn't already have a bit where you'd gone, 'oh go on then! Go on and make your own way!'\" And again she laughs.</p> <p>She has also, over the past three or so years, spent a lot of time dissecting the nature of marriage. When she was writing her novel (which begins with a visit from Silvia's ex-husband, still trying to work out what the power relationships were in their marriage, how they capsized) she was acting alongside Alfred Molina in BBC2 sitcom Roger and Val Have Just Got In. Set in real time, in the half hour when they get home from work every day, it is \"a piece about the intricacies, and the smallness of a marriage,\" the day-to-day glue, particularly when, as in the case of Roger and Val, they are in the process of surviving the death of a baby, distracting each other, as French puts it, \"with play and constant blether\". French has described the sitcom as \"like stealing money from the comedy department to make a drama\"; it was reviewed in this paper as \"not \u2026 comedy as we know it, but Roger &amp; Val manages to mix beautifully written dialogue with a quiet observational humour that can nevertheless leave the viewer gasping for air\"; French's performance was one of the best of her career. Although French didn't write the sitcom (twins Beth and Emma Kilcoyne did that), the idea for it was hers, developed while her real-life, 25-year marriage to Lenny Henry was breaking up.</p> <p>She and Henry have both described their parting as involving a year of concerted effort to be kind, and to end up \"as chums, as we had started, if you like\". Perhaps this is true, and very impressive if so; perhaps there is a good helping of wish fulfilment, or a united front for the media. Whatever the case, both are now seeing other people, Henry a theatre producer, and French a charity worker who used to work with her mother, and who also had, somewhat to&#xa0;her surprise (given how much of a mainstay she has been in the BBC light entertainment schedules for the last 30 years), never seen her on screen.</p> <p>French discovered her own capacity for humour early, and partly perforce: as the daughter of an RAF engineer, she often found herself in a new school and forced to make friends, fast, or at least to deflect potential enemies. It is a gift that has kept on giving, career-wise, but she is well aware that it has been useful in many other ways. \"First of all, it's delicious.\" Her arms are unfolded now; she leans forward, chin on palm. \"I love it when somebody makes me laugh \u2013 it's what attracts me to people. It's what attracted me to Jennifer [Saunders]. My whole career with Jennifer\" \u2013 first on stage, then on Channel 4, on The Comic Strip Presents (which celebrates its 30th anniversary next month with a one-off episode, Five Go to Rehab), then as double act French and Saunders on the BBC \u2013 \"has been about trying to make her laugh. And it is such a treat and such a reward when she does. And I know she feels the same about me.\"</p> <p>Which is not to say there aren't tripwires. When she had her daughter, French stepped back from the double act and watched from the sidelines as Saunders achieved success with Absolutely Fabulous. Was that not difficult? Did she not feel competitive, left out? \"Not competitive \u2013 I think I&#xa0;had&#xa0;a proper, healthy jealousy about successes that she had, and I would tell her that \u2013 but my love of her is bigger than any jealousy I have of her. I think it was when she won a Bafta or something for&#xa0;Ab Fab the first time, I remember sending her a bouquet of flowers with a note saying, 'well done, you clever c\u2014'\" A great cackle of laughter. \"It's things like that I will say to her. 'Fuck you for being so good at this. Who knew you were going to be good at this? Who knew you were going to be so good at this without me? Not that I thought, 'I'm the thing,' but I thought together was the thing \u2013 but it's like a pride you'd have in watching anybody that you love do it, on their own. You think actually, 'yes'.\"</p> <p>She is refreshingly straightforward about how humour gives her a certain kind of power. \"I've often said the most difficult things I have to say to people through humour. I can very quickly put someone in their place with it. But we all walk away unscathed because there's been some funnies around it, and I'll usually make sure that it comes back at me. Every joke I ever told with Jennifer was always, 'We are the fools \u2013 you are not the fool, I am the fool.' And I will also control it, I will control what you're laughing at. I could have been a little fat kid that other kids would laugh at, without me controlling it. But that didn't happen. I decided, 'OK, this is what I'll do. I'll let you think you're laughing at this, I'll let you think that's your thing, and then I'm going to shape it a bit for you.' Call me a massive control freak, but it's just a way of being.\"</p> <p>How does she think comedy has changed since she started out? For instance, it's hard to escape at the moment a strong thread of cruelty, of which comedians such as Frankie Boyle are the apogee. \"Yes, I agree. But maybe it's a bit like buses \u2013 maybe quite a lot of cruel comedians just happen to be in the ether at the moment. [Maybe] it'll pass, and then we'll get lots of lovely people pretending to be animals for a while. That would be great,\" she laughs.</p> <p>She feels, too, that television has changed a great deal: that the BBC had the courage to take a punt on new acts, and then let them develop with each series; now it's \"all to do with ratings and people are afraid to take the risk\". It's an attitude she feels extends into crises, such as the Savile crisis currently engulfing the BBC \u2013 \"immediate mud-slinging, immediate accusations flinging everywhere\", the immediate demand for heads to roll. \"This man [George Entwhistle] has been in his job for five weeks, hasn't he? And he seems to be to blame for everything. I don't know enough about it. I don't think any of us do.\" She remembers a hands-off culture that she insists was only creative. In fact, on set, \"people were quite strict about what you could and couldn't do. I&#xa0;never came across anything like this. That's why I'm completely shocked. I&#xa0;just hope [the BBC] doesn't implode as a result of it, that would be terribly sad, it can't fall as a result of this. Can it?\"</p> <p>As she has got older, she says, she has felt less and less the need to perform, to&#xa0;put on a \"firework display. And it's a massive relief. Somewhere in my 40s I&#xa0;thought, 'this is exhausting, trying to make it alright for everybody and trying to please everyone all the time.' It doesn't mean you have to turn in and be entirely selfish \u2013 it just means you have to stop a little bit of that.\" Did people find it disconcerting? \"I think some people did, yeah. Because I just went a bit quieter. I think you only find out your true nature when you return home, and when you have a bit of peace and quiet.</p> <p>These days she spends most of her time at her house in Cornwall, writing (she has two more novels expected by Penguin). After decades of collaborative work she says she relishes the independence. \"There is something about making every decision, every decision \u2013 commas, full stops \u2013 everything \u2026 that is \u2026 delightful. I've lived in a world of compromise. Most of which has been excellently good, and a good lesson for me. But there is something, when you want to shoot off a certain way, and no one is saying, 'Don't!' \u2026 So here I go!\"</p> <p><em>Oh Dear Silvia by Dawn French is published by Michael Joseph.

  "<p>Women who smoke into middle-age have three times the death rate of non-smokers and risk dying at least 10 years early, according to a <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)61720-6/abstract\" title=\"\">definitive study of the effects of tobacco in more than a million women</a> in the UK.</p> <p>The good news, according to the study by a team of Oxford University researchers led by Sir Richard Peto, is that giving up cigarettes before the age of 40 reduces a woman's risk of smoking-related death by 90%. Quitting by 30 reduces it by 97%.</p> <p>The study, published by <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/\" title=\"\">the Lancet </a>a day before the 100th anniversary of the birth of Sir Richard Doll, who first established the link between smoking and lung cancer, shows conclusively for the first time that the disastrous effects of smoking for men are no different for women.</p> <p>Because men historically began to smoke in large numbers earlier than women \u2013 most of the first generation of women with a lifelong smoking habit were born in the 1940s \u2013 the life-shortening impact of cigarettes on them has not until recently been fully measurable.</p> <p>\"If women smoke like men, they die like men,\" said Peto. \"But whether they are men or women, smokers who stop before reaching middle-age will on average gain about an extra 10 years of life.\"</p> <p>The data comes from the Million Women Study, which recruited 1.3 million women between 1996 and 2001 when they went for breast cancer screening, aged between 50 and 65. The study, unique because of its size, has compiled a vast amount of information on women's health and led, among other things, to important findings on risk factors for breast cancer.</p> <p>The women filled in questionnaires on their lifestyle, medical history and social background at the time of recruitment and again three years later. They have been followed up for an average of 12 years. At the start of the study, 20% were smokers and 28% former smokers.</p> <p>Persistent smokers were nearly three times as likely to die over the study period as non-smokers. The results show that two-thirds of all deaths of smokers in their 50s, 60s and 70s are caused by smoking \u2013 not only through cancer but also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jun/29/smoking-ban-health-benefits?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">other smoking-related illnesses</a> such as heart disease and stroke.</p> <p>The more women in the study smoked, the greater their risk of premature death. Even those who considered themselves social smokers, having between one and nine cigarettes a day, had double the death rate of non-smokers. The increased risks remained, even after adjusting for the fact that smokers were more likely to live in deprived areas, drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week and avoid strenuous exercise.</p> <p>The age at which women started smoking was important. Picking up the habit at a young age increased the length of time for which they smoked and their risk of an early death. Although fewer women were now starting to smoke, those who are could be doing greater damage to their health. \"In those days smokers were starting in late teens and now it is in their early teens,\" said Peto.</p> <p>Although stopping well before the age of 40 will substantially reduce women's risk of dying early, \"this does not mean \u2026 that it is safe to smoke until age 40 years and then stop, for women who do so have throughout the next few decades a mortality rate 1.2 times that of never-smokers,\" says the paper. \"This is a substantial excess risk, causing one in six of the deaths among these ex-smokers.\"</p> <p>Peto said the Million Women Study had allowed unprecedented insights into women's health prospects and could only have been carried out in the UK.</p> <p>\"It is completely brilliant because the NHS health records are so brilliant. You couldn't do it in any other country in Europe. We can send details of the women to the NHS central register and we get told what everybody died of. Every time they go to hospital, we know about it.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 October 2012. The original article and headline said that 'Women who quit smoking before 35 cut risk of tobacco-related death by 97%.\" This has now been corrected to \"before 30\".</p>",
  "<p>I'm an accidental landlady and it's giving me a headache. Of all the aspects of being Dad's power of attorney, property management is perhaps the one that makes me feel most out of my depth. I know, I know \u2013 it's not hard. I just need to be organised. But for some reason, I seem to have a mental block.</p> <p>In part it's because I've been spoilt thus far. A letting agent in Penzance deals with his property there. A family friend, she has held my hand through repeated floods, disputes about noise and extensive renovations; insulating me from the realities.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the London flat he owns has been rented by my younger sister, who dealt with any problems herself as they arose. But she decided to move back to Cornwall recently, and since then the questions have piled up.</p> <p>Should I go with the cut-throat lettings agent who will get the most rent but charge a staggering commission?</p> <p>Or should I advertise it on Facebook and put friends of friends in there at a lower rate, in the hope they won't ring me up every five minutes?</p> <p>Then there's the boiler safety check to organise, the energy certificate, the paint job, getting keys to new tenants, the contract, whether I need to provide more furniture, the mould from an old damp problem \u2026</p> <p>And don't get me started on the tenancy deposit protection scheme. The mere mention of it makes me feel queasy.</p> <p>Instead of being decisive, I've been approaching the whole thing as if shuffling towards an unpinned grenade.</p> <p>Partly, it's because I don't want to make a silly mistake; but there's something else too. I feel at one remove from the responsibility. As if owning it properly will mean that I've conceded that Dad can't do it himself. That he will never be able to do such things ever again.</p> <p>There's a chunk of me that still feels like the child in this scenario. Even though I'm aware my father struggles to feed himself, I'm still hoping he might sweep in and take charge. Make everything OK.</p> <p>It's a fantasy. Even fighting fit, Dad wasn't especially organised about such affairs, and his knowledge of the London rental market was far worse than mine.</p> <p>He bought the flat as an investment when he retired, on my advice, and only visited it a handful of times. It's on an Islington side street, as resolutely urban an environment as you can imagine. A world away from the vista he was used to: fields, country lanes, the ticker tape of cobalt sea on the horizon.</p> <p>I don't think he liked it especially, couldn't imagine why anyone would ever want to live in such a place. Indeed, he would probably have sought my opinion on the best route to take in letting it.</p> <p>I long, nonetheless, to ask for his advice, to defer to the familial hierarchy that's been routed so unexpectedly. Luckily, other family members have stepped in to help. Seeing me flailing and being vague, I think they realised they had to. The sister who vacated it has found some acquaintances interested in a six-month let. My mother rang around to find a plumber who could do the boiler safety certificate. She has also rounded up the keys and is ringing around handymen.</p> <p>Their help has spurred me into action. I've just downloaded an online tenancy agreement and set a time to get it signed. Just don't ask me about the deposit protection scheme. I'm working up to&#xa0;that.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Follow Rebecca on Twitter, </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rebeccahelenley\" title=\"\"><em>@rebeccahelenley</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Darren Tambin is proud of his DIY skills \u2013 justifiably so because not only has the wallpaper in his sitting room been hung meticulously and the shelves set straight, but Darren, 46, is also completely blind. So how does he do it? \"It's a team effort. All the family muck in to help. I hold the wallpaper up and the children line up the pattern for me.\"</p> <p>Which is fair enough, until you discover that all the Tambins \u2013 his wife, Elaine, 41, sons Sid, 21, and Little Darren, 17, and daughter Laura, 19 \u2013 have severe visual impairments. Four of them are registered blind, and Little Darren is partially sighted.</p> <p>They rely a lot on Little Darren. In another family he'd probably be considered disabled, but in the Tambin household he is, visually speaking, the most able. \"When we need things looked at, he's the one we usually turn to,\" says Elaine. \"He can see things when they're really big and close-up, although hasn't got any long-distance vision. Sid can see bright colours and make out the difference between dark and light, and Laura can see a bit when things are really close. Big Darren is completely blind and I have a tiny bit of vision, but it's very blurred.\"</p> <p>Elaine and Darren met when she was 18 and he was 23. They both worked at a packing factory in Northampton where the workforce included many visually impaired people. \"I knew straight away that he was the one for me,\" she says.</p> <p>\"My father was against it \u2013 he said I was making life too difficult for myself, marrying someone with the same disability. But you know what they say ... love is blind.\"</p> <p>Darren and Elaine were both from Durham, and both visually impaired since birth. After their wedding in April 1990 they sought advice from a <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/2370.aspx\" title=\"\">genetic counsellor</a> about the risk of passing on their condition to any children they might have. They were told there was a less than 1% chance their offspring would have full sight. \"I'm sure there were people then, and there have certainly been people since, who have said what were we thinking of, having children when we knew they'd almost certainly be blind,\" says Elaine.</p> <p>\"But why shouldn't we have children \u2013 and why shouldn't we have ambitions and expectations for them?\"</p> <p>Sid arrived first, then Laura and Darren and, like any family with three children under four years of age, the Tambins had their work cut out. Once the children were toddling, safety was a major issue. And then there were the guide dogs to look after. Elaine has Nellie, while Laura has Quarry, Sid has Jamie and Mindy has been succeeded by Eddie. \"The dogs are part of the family too,\" says Elaine.</p> <p>But in the early days when they only had Mindy, family outings involved Darren in front holding Sid's hand and Mindy's lead, with Elaine behind pushing the double buggy. \"Darren would wear a high-visibility jacket so I could see where he was going,\" says Elaine.</p> <p>As the children started school there were various educational issues to sort out. \"I went to a mainstream primary, and on one of the first days the teacher told me to copy something from the board,\" says Little Darren. \"I had to tell her I couldn't even see the board, let alone what was written on it.</p> <p>\"Sometimes you'd get a teacher who'd say, 'you're just the same as everyone else.' Well, of course I'm just the same as everyone else \u2013 but I can't see everything everyone else can see, so I do need that to be taken into&#xa0;account.\"</p> <p>The problem at times, says Elaine, was that \"Teachers knew a lot about what they were teaching, but some needed to be educated themselves in dealing with pupils with a disability.\"</p> <p>Big Darren and Elaine had both left school at 16, but they didn't want that for their children. \"No one was going to tell us our kids couldn't aim high,\" says Elaine. The children benefited from a combination of being sometimes in mainstream educational settings and sometimes at specialist schools. Now, Sid is studying IT and Laura is at Birmingham City University studying law and criminology. \"No one will be fobbing them off with a job in a packing factory, that's for sure,\" says Elaine.</p> <p>Young Darren, meanwhile, is studying for a BTec in IT at college, and getting ready for a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2012/cin-rickshaw-challenge.html\" title=\"\">411-mile cross-country rickshaw ride with One Show presenter Matt Baker</a> for this year's BBC Children in Need appeal.</p> <p>It hasn't been all about academic achievement, say Big Darren and Elaine \u2013 there was plenty of fun along the way. \"You get people saying, how can a blind child ride a bike or use a skateboard?\" says Elaine. \"But we say, why should they miss out?\"</p> <p>\"I took them down to a big field and pushed them along till they could pedal their bikes,\" says Darren.</p> <p>\"We've had teachers who have told them, 'You won't be able to do PE, just go on the treadmill,'\" says Elaine. \"But I don't want my children on the boring treadmill. What about high-visibility balls, or balls with bells inside? There are ways round the problems \u2013 people just need to look for them.\"</p> <p>Elaine's commitment to improving sport for blind youngsters has been all the stronger because she's had heart disease. \"I've had three heart attacks \u2013 I know it's connected with being overweight. We have to start taking blind people's fitness a lot more seriously.\"</p> <p>\"The biggest difficulties the kids faced at school was what other children and their parents said and how they behaved: you'd hear people in the playground saying, 'Don't play with the blind kids, they can't run around like you.' Or they'd say, 'Don't invite the blind children for tea, they won't be able to do the things you can do.'</p> <p>\"The Paralympics helped, but there's still a long way to go.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 Darren Tambin, Matt Baker and the other rickshaw riders will be setting out&#xa0;from Llandudno on 9 November.

  "<p>Rachel Held Evans is a liberal, outspoken young American who votes Democrat, believes in evolution and describes herself as a feminist. But when she got married in 2003, in her early 20s, she entered into it with one clear assumption: she would submit to her husband in all things. They would stick to traditional gender roles \u2013 he would \"bring home the bacon and I would fry it\" \u2013 and he would call the shots.</p> <p>These expectations were born out of growing up in conservative, evangelically Christian Tennessee, where women, particularly as wives, are expected to embody the ideal of a \"biblical woman\". The term is, of course, woolly and inconsistent at best \u2013 at worst, dangerous. It is also inherently selective. At the one extreme, it suggests women be meek housewives with no career aspirations; at the other \u2013 well, as Evans points out: \"Technically speaking, it is biblical for a woman to be sold by her father, biblical<em> </em>for her to be forced to marry her rapist and biblical for her to be one of multiple wives.\"</p> <p>Many of her church-going friends felt a sense of comfort and security in following this ideal. But not Evans. \"It never felt right,\" she says. \"My personality was never going to fit the mould.\" More importantly, common sense took over. Both she and her husband, Dan, have creative, freelance jobs \u2013 she a writer and blogger, he a web designer \u2013 which means \"you don't care who brings home the bacon as long as it's enough to pay the internet bill\". They quickly realised they functioned best as a team. \"Sure, we argued from time to time, but we never encountered a situation in which Dan had to invoke some kind of God-ordained gavel strike in order to get his way. It just didn't feel natural to us.\"</p> <p>For Evans and her husband, both products of Bible-belt America, it was a revelation. However, she felt conflict. She was confused as to how something she believed in so deeply \u2013 the Bible \u2013 felt so unnatural when it was applied to her relationship; and she couldn't work out why friends felt the need to impose a traditional hierarchy on their marriages that simply didn't work.</p> <p>So she embarked on an experiment. In order to creatively critique the notion of biblical womanhood, and to challenge the traditionalist view of women, she decided to take the Bible's instructions for women \"hyper-literally\" for a year. Inspired by AJ Jacobs' book <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780099509790\" title=\"\">The Year of Living Biblically</a>, she set out to discover what biblical womanhood meant, and if a modern, emancipated woman could still live by the teachings of an ancient text she loved, but that was often troubling and misogynist.</p> <p>First, Evans drew up a list of habits to adopt for the year. She taught herself to cook and sew. In order to devote herself to \"the duties of the home\", she adjusted her routine, making the bed before checking her email, and doing the laundry before sitting down to write. She would cover her head with a beret at all times, and let her hair grow. The latter was one of the hardest parts of the whole experiment. \"It looked terrible and I felt really insecure. It was also a constant reminder of what I was putting myself through.\"</p> <p>She also decided to examine a different \"virtue\" each month. One of the earliest was dressing modestly. So she wore a billowing peasant skirt and a plain cardigan buttoned to the neck. She found the looks she attracted, and the assumptions that accompanied them, irritating. Dan experienced this too. \"I find myself feeling like I should talk to her differently,\" he wrote in his journal at the time. \"I also wonder what people think about me \u2013 am I an oppressive chauvinist? Do I control her and yell at her behind closed doors?\"</p> <p>Another month, she followed the Bible's strictures on menstruation \u2013 that it makes women impure, and anything and anyone they come into contact with unclean. For Evans, it meant that she mustn't have any physical contact with Dan during her period.</p> <p>She camped in the front garden for three days and spent the following nine sleeping in the spare room, using the guest bathroom. To avoid sitting on something and rendering it unclean, she carried a cushion around with her.</p> <p>\"It was weird not touching my own husband,\" she writes. \"I never appreciated how often we communicated through the silent but assuring gestures of a squeeze of the hand, a head on a shoulder, a back-scratch, a high-five. The human touch is a powerful connective bond and going without it can be strangely isolating.\"</p> <p>An Orthodox Jewish friend had told Evans that the sexual longing induced by the forced separation was powerful. But Evans didn't experience it \u2013 she just felt lonely.</p> <p>It was her attempts to submit to her husband \"in everything\" \u2013 the thing that, as soon as she married, she realised she would never be able to do \u2013 that she found hardest. She let him choose which films they watched, and which restaurants they ate in. But she and Dan couldn't take it seriously. \"We were just pretending.\"</p> <p>Only once did Dan use his new-found dictatorial status to really put his foot down. Just before Christmas, Evans was swamped with work, but had decided to throw a house party anyway. \"Under normal circumstances, he would have let me self-destruct, as he has in the past when it comes to my tendency to overcommit,\" she writes. \"But this year, Dan got his way.\" How did it feel when he made you cancel it? \"Unfair. It made me feel really small.\"</p> <p>If it hadn't been for practising submission, this show-down might have been part of a healthy marriage's frustrating give-and-take. But in that context, it felt one-sided. \"It made me realise that our own marriage is about both us of being mutually submissive, when it matters,\" she says.</p> <p>For Dan, submission month was hard. \"For the last decade our relationship has been built on mutual understanding. If disagreements come up, we work through the issues on a level playing field. In many ways, our relationship is continuing as usual, but just knowing I have in my possession a 'you'd-have-to-if-I-said-so' trump card makes things seems a little out of balance. Not sure how I feel about that. I can see why a person would feel powerful having it, but I'm not sure that makes it OK.\"</p> <p>It's easy to mock these radical life experiments as inauthentic, but Evans at least had a didactic purpose. \"I wanted to help free women from this impossible ideal of womanhood. And invite them to cut themselves, and one another, some slack.\"</p> <p>After the year was up, what conclusions did she draw? \"That there is no such thing as 'biblical womanhood',\" she says. But above all, the project made her grateful for her husband, his respect for her and his patience.</p> <p>Did it make her question the Bible's teachings? \"All the time. No one can read it all and not get angry. It was written in a highly patriarchal culture, where wives were akin to slaves. But its troubling aspects don't, for me, erase its other messages.\"</p> <p>The book has already attracted controversy. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/17/mention-vagina-evangelical-bookshop\" title=\"\">A major US Christian book chain is not stocking it, she claims, because it includes the word vagina</a>. But Evans refused to remove the references out of respect for her \"impassioned readership\", rather than kowtowing to objections within the Christian publishing industry. Her website, <a href=\"http://rachelheldevans.com/\" title=\"\">rachelheldevans.com</a>, has a lot of clout, attracting nearly 5,000 readers a day.</p> <p>Does she think the book can speak to non-religious readers? \"I think my experiences are universal. And it will hopefully appeal to anyone who has an idealised vision of women \u2013 and how it's impossible not to fall short of that.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 A Year of Biblical Womanhood is published by Thomas Nelson, \u00a39.99.

  "<p>From day one, Walford has been littered with glum-looking youths, all of them ordered into cafes and on to benches, leaving their parents free to carry on with adultery, blood feuds and ballsing things up. But over the last few years, all but the most tolerant viewers have struggled with the sheer volume of young actors triple-somersaulting out of stage school into the Square.</p> <p>At the children's party <strong>EastEnders</strong> now often resembles, Lola can be found amid upturned bowls of crisps lobbing missiles at the clown. Plucked out of care by grandfather Billy Mitchell, she hasn't been dealt a bad hand so much as had life throw the deck in her face. Following her recent pregnancy \u2013 Lola was shackled for most of it \u2013 she was appointed a string of social workers in a story centred entirely around what they will not stop referring to as \"bum cream\". Since baby Lexi's birth, it's been bum cream this, bum cream that. Bum cream left, right and centre. \"Does Lexi have any bum cream, Lola?\" some raised eyebrow on legs would ask.</p> <p>\"It's all right, I'm nicking a haul of posh bum cream from Janine's nursery,\" she would reply. \"It's like taking bum cream from a baby.\" If the camera were to pan to the notes the social worker pointedly jotted down every 30 seconds, we'd see page upon page of \"bum cream, bum cream, bum cream\", like some post-natal redux of The Shining. The Whining, if you will.</p> <p>Despite her troubles, things had been looking relatively bright for Lola. About five minutes after wiping the sweat from her brow and drop-kicking her placenta into a nearby wheelie bin, she stuck on a tabard and poached enough cleaning clients to buy all the bum cream her little heart desired. She even had Alexa, an old children's home pal, turn up for some japes. EastEnders being EastEnders, this meant only one thing: abject misery. Alexa arrived out of the blue with her band of wayward girls. They advanced through Walford like an eddy of H&amp;M slogan T-shirts: scowling, smoking, happy-slapping Abi Branning and dripping with ire. Even little baby Lexi didn't escape. Alexa hadn't quite got the hang of cooing into a buggy, instead proffering \"she's a right minger\", and over-stepping the mark a little with, \"I think I'll give her her first kicking \u2013 put some colour in her cheeks.\"</p> <p>To this, Lola delivered one of the most deserved smack-in-the-gobs in EastEnders history, and boy have there been some contenders. This fist of justice morphed into a grinding, mangled train wreck, of course. Later that night, Lola wailed in the street as the police prised her baby from her arms and led her into custody.</p> <p>There's a different kind of child-catcher to fear over on <strong>Coronation Street</strong>. Tracy Barlow is the twisted figure for whom children check under their beds at night. \"You'd better behave, or Tracy will scratch at your window and gobble you up.\" Or in Michelle's case, shag your son, Ryan. Michelle's misdeed was shacking up with Steve, who weathered the worst of the ensuing shitstorm by buggering off to visit mum Liz in the Costa del Convenient.</p> <p>Recent drug scandal aside, Ryan is but a naive lamb of a boy, which Tracy exploited as only Tracy can. She chose the sexually charged atmosphere of Prima Doner kebab house to snare him, while Michelle suffered through gritted teeth. They canoodled by the warmth of the kebab spit. They canoodled in dank corners of the Rovers. They canoodled on Michelle's two-seater sofa (and believe me, a less inviting place to canoodle is hard to imagine). They canoodled until the sight gave Michelle heebie-jeebies of such magnitude that she had no choice but to chuck young Ryan out. So off he toddled with his bindle-stick to play at running away, taking refuge at Sally's house. In the most shocking soap twist the nation has witnessed, Sally actually played peace-maker.</p> <p>Across the cobbles, Tracy's nostrils flared at the scent of resolution. As mother and son made up, Tracy swooped over to make the surprise announcement that she had harvested Ryan's seed and was spawning. As if that wasn't enough for poor Michelle to deal with, Steve arrived back in stupid sunglasses clutching a pi\u00f1ata, and proved to be about as much help as, well, Steve McDonald in stupid sunglasses clutching a pi\u00f1ata.</p> <p>In the run-up to its 40th birthday special, <strong>Emmerdale</strong> hosted Homefields 2012 festival. Kerry Wyatt's declaration \u2013 \"I'm fully equipped for any emergency. I've got a blow-up cushion, glitter spray, and some novelty flashing sunnies\" \u2013 is the kind of hubris usually followed by a large-scale disaster. My heart swelled with hope for a pastoral Altamont but all the drama was saved for the hour-long live special, which featured two weddings, dual births and death by half-brick.</p> <p>Television births aren't known for being calm. The unrelenting panic usually leaves you trembling and exhausted, as if you've just birthed a wriggling 12lb lump of flesh yourself. Gennie's happy moment proved as dignified as it was tranquil, as she mooed her way through labour in the middle of a wedding reception. Roused by the sounds of bovine distress, Paddy the vet stepped in, but stumbled out again, three sheets to the wind, as a conga line of wedding guests craned their necks for a good peer up the birth canal. They could have at least turned the strobing disco light next to her head off.</p> <p><strong><em>If you are affected by any of the issues raised here, you can discuss them at </em></strong><a href=\"http://theguardian.com/tv-and-radio\" title=\"\"><strong><em>theguardian.com/tv-and-radio</em></strong></a><em> </em></p>",

Golding had a close connection with Salisbury. He lived in the city and taught at Bishop Wordsworth's grammar school in the Cathedral Close. It also provided him with the inspiration for The Spire which tells the story of Dean Jocelin and the men who envisaged building a 400-foot spire on Salisbury Cathedral, in spite of the fact that no one had ever built that high, the cathedral had no foundations, and there was no money. Gareth Machin directs a local story on an epic scale, adapted here by Roger Spottiswoode.</p> <p><strong><em>Salisbury Playhouse, Thu to 24 Nov</em></strong></p> <p><em>LG</em></p> <h2>Orpheus Descending, Manchester</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398407886\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/25/1351169563744/Orpheus-Descending-008.jpg\" alt=\"Orpheus Descending\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Imogen Stubbs.

But with the current US president being a black man espousing liberal values, it would seem that a great deal has changed since Williams's depiction of small-town life in America's deep south in the 1940s. Or has it? Frankcom's production aims to hold up a mirror to the contemporary world and maybe even to the hate crimes of modern America. She tells the story of a young drifter who arrives in a small town with nothing but a guitar and who manages to form a relationship with Lady Torrance, an unhappy woman trapped in a loveless marriage. She's played by Imogen Stubbs who scored a hit at the same theatre last year as Amanda in Private Lives.</p> <p><strong><em>Royal Exchange Theatre, to 24 Nov</em></strong></p> <p><em>LG</em></p> <h2>Daddy Long Legs, London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398407887\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/25/1351169713048/daddy-long-legs-008.jpg\" alt=\"daddy long legs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Adelman Hancock and Megan McGinnis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeanee Tanner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>John Caird, who co-directed Les Mis\u00e9rables and Nicholas Nickleby with Trevor Nunn, returns to the musical stage with a show of his own at London's newest theatre.

Don\u2019t read on if you haven\u2019t seen episode two \u2013 and if you\u2019ve seen later episodes, please do not leave spoilers.</em></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/oct/19/walking-dead-season-three-episode-one\" title=\"\">\u2022 Phelim O\u2019Neill\u2019s episode one blog</a></p> \n<h2>\u201cSick\u201d</h2> \n<p>We\u2019re straight into episode two with another no-messing around, impressively cold opening. I loved how the convicts were left with just Hershel\u2019s amputated leg in a pool of blood after their shell-shocking interruption.</p> \n<h2>The cast regulars</h2> \n<p>Lori and Rick seemed to be on the right footing again, with her comforting \u201cyou\u2019re not a killer\u201d speech and admittance that she was a \u201cshitty wife\u201d. But their quiet moment together later \u2013 when Rick signed off the conversation with an extremely hard-hearted \u201cWe\u2019re awful grateful for what you did\u201d and a token gesture of a hand on her shoulder \u2013 was more hurtful than any zombie bite. Harsh stuff.</p> \n<p>Saving Hershel\u2019s life and dealing with the prisoners gave them all plenty to do: a good distraction from continually complaining about Rick\u2019s leadership. And this was another fine week for the increasingly useful Carol who, it turned out, had received a little medical training from Hershel. Her idea to use one of the plentiful zombies as an anatomical learning tool for dealing with Lori\u2019s sure-to-be-problematic childbirth was inspired. But who \u2013 or more likely what \u2013 was watching her? Carl, meanwhile, appears to be entering his difficult teenage years a little early: it looks as if he\u2019s not going to put up with being treated like a kid for much longer.</p> \n<h2>New characters</h2> \n<p>Initially it seemed as if there were plenty of new survivors to be added to the cast. But by the end of the episode the five convicts had been whittled down to just two: Axel and Oscar. And even their future is far from guaranteed.</p> \n<p>(According to IMDB, the guy with the stylish moustache is Axel, while the ones that didn\u2019t last are poor old Big Tiny, Andrew \u2013 left in the zombie-filled exercise yard by Rick \u2013 and Tomas, the troublemaker with the spider tattoo.)</p> \n<p>The convicts were thinking in the same manner as 10 months ago; believing that society still existed and help was on the way. But they were too slow on the uptake, locked into a closed-mind prison mentality that proved their undoing: their fighting style was pure \u201cprison riot\u201d, which isn\u2019t much use on a zombie.</p> \n<p>Was Tomas really trying to kill Rick when he threw that zombie at him or testing to see how tough he was? Either way it was not behaviour that could be tolerated in a zombie-filled world, so he got a well-earned machete to the head (echoes of Romero\u2019s Dawn Of The Dead there). Axel and Oscar are sure to be interesting: they may claim to be harmless \u2026 but Axel looked expert with that shiv.</p> \n<h2>Surviving</h2> \n<p>The relentless grind of continually moving to avoid herds of walking dead has really taken its toll on the survivors. They had enough human decency left to play fair with the immediately aggressive prisoners, even though they were clearly more trouble than they were worth. But they have limits \u2013 and the breaking point seems to be reached very quickly. When faced with Tomas, the old Rick would have talked about the situation and possible outcomes for several episodes: the new proactive, worn-out Rick doesn\u2019t have that luxury. New Rick makes for better television.</p> \n<h2>Zombie of the Week</h2> \n<p>For a while it looked as if it was going to be Hershel \u2013 surely the kiss-of-life technique should be excised from medical books in a post zombie-apocalypse world? But the best zombie gag was the handcuffed prisoner walker who forced his own hand off to free himself from the cuffs \u2013 leaving a sharp bone weapon that proved Big Tiny\u2019s undoing. It looks as if criminal zombies are slightly more shifty than the regular, law-abiding ones.</p> \n<p>So how was it for you? It was more like part two of the season opener than a standalone instalment, but it looks as if next week we\u2019re away from the prison and off rejoining old friends and meeting more new characters. Maybe these ones will be able to stick around for a bit. The subject of comic-related spoilers cropped up a few times in the comments last week. Such things really should be avoided or at least clearly marked, but on that topic it should be noted that the prison events played out differently on TV from in the comics.</p> \n<figure

  "<p>A gay man from Essex who donated his sperm to enable a lesbian couple to have two children, but who was never named on their birth certificate and had no role in their upbringing, is being forced by the Child Support Agency to pay for their support \u2013 13 years after the first child was born.</p> <p>Mark Langridge, who has been with his partner for 16 years (and in a civil partnership for the last five), has called on the government to review the law after the CSA suddenly demanded that he start paying \u00a326 a week for two children he technically fathered over a decade ago.</p> <p>He has had no contact with the family since 2004, but the CSA said that he has to either pay up, or take a DNA test to show that he is not their natural father.</p> <p>His story will send shivers down the spine of any man who was asked to donate their sperm by a childless woman in the 90s.</p> <p>Back then it was impossible for women to use official sperm banks unless they had a male partner \u2013 something that is no longer the case.</p> <p>Changes to the law mean that if Langridge made the donation today in similar circumstances he wouldn't be financially liable for the children, and he has called for the law governing this area to be applied retrospectively. It is thought that there are several other men caught up in the same position.</p> <p>His story starts in 1997 when he and his partner Shaun met a lesbian couple in Bliss nightclub in Southend. They became good friends and it soon became clear that one of the women was keen to have children.</p> <p>As a result, in 1998, Langridge visited the Essex home of the mum-to-be, glass container in hand, and in a separate room the woman inseminated herself.</p> <p>He says he only agreed to it after being given repeated assurances that the couple were financially secure and would need no financial input from him at any stage. He was told by the mother that he was not named on the child's birth certificate, and that the mother's story would be that she'd had a fling and that the father had gone back to the US.</p> <p>A year later she asked him again to donate, as she wanted a sibling for her child and thought it would be nicer to have the same father. He agreed and another girl was born in the spring of 2000. Again, he was told he was not named on the birth certificate.</p> <p>A few years later his relationship with the mother and her female partner started to deteriorate, to the point where he no longer saw them or their daughters. He received the occasional letter from the girls, to which he replied.</p> <p>What he did not know was that the lesbian couple split up, leaving one of the mothers with both children, who later sought support from the state.</p> <p>One reason he felt willing to donate his sperm was that the couple had been promised a large sum of money which would give them a level of financial security. However, when that money came through they had separated.</p> <p>He understands that the non-biological mother in the pair continues to live near the former family home, and to see the girls at weekends, in the same way, he says, any other divorced or separated parent would \u2013 even though they were never civil partners. Yet the CSA is not chasing the other mother for support payments.</p> <p>He says that over the years the mother threatened she would tell the CSA that he was the father, and in June this year he received a letter demanding he contribute to the children's maintenance.</p> <p>Because he is self-employed and lives on a low income as a part-time book-keeper and gardener, the \u00a326 a week that has been calculated by the CSA is money, he says, he doesn't have. \"Of course, if I'd foreseen this all those years ago I would not have agreed to it. I just wanted to help a woman in need, and thought what harm could it do?\" he adds. \"I have told the CSA what happened but it has fallen on deaf ears. As far it is concerned, if I'm the biological father I have to pay \u2013 irrespective of the circumstances.\"</p> <p>Guardian Money made attempts to track down the women but we were unsuccessful and, as a result, have taken the decision not to name or identify them.</p> <p>A spokesman for the CSA confirmed the situation. \"The law covering unlicensed sperm donation has always been very clear. Only anonymous sperm donors, at licensed centres, are exempt from being treated as the legal father of a child born as a result of their donation.</p> <p>\"This has never applied to men who donate sperm as part of a personal arrangement. Unless the child is legally adopted, both biological parents are financially responsible for their child by law, regardless of whether both their names are entered on to the birth certificate.\"</p> <p>Natalie Gamble, founder of Natalie Gamble Associates, the UK's foremost experts on fertility law, says the law in this area changed a few years ago.</p> <p>\"Had the donation taken place after April 2009, or through a clinic, the law would have viewed his responsibility very differently. In that case he would not be deemed the father, provided the consenting couple to which he was making the donation were in a civil partnership, or his donation to the couple was through a licensed clinic. The fact that it was made on a private basis before that date means the law is very clear. He is considered the father.\"</p> <p>Her company represented the last high-profile case in this area \u2013 fireman Andy Bathie. His case, which came to light in 2007, was almost identical to Langridge's. His donation had enabled another lesbian couple to have children.</p> <p>When they split and the mother claimed benefits, he was chased by the CSA for thousands of pounds. He was forced to take a DNA test which confirmed he was the father.</p> <p>Unable to afford children of his own with his wife because of the payments, he called on the law to be applied retrospectively \u2013 a call echoed this week by Langridge, who says he simply can't afford the tens of thousands of pounds it would cost to mount a legal challenge through the courts.</p> <p>\"The law was changed because it was unfair, but it is still considered OK for men caught in my position to be penalised,\" he says.</p> <p>\"Our only crime was agreeing to do someone a good turn. It is absurd that I'm being chased for the money while the children's other mother makes no contribution to their upkeep.</p> <p>\"How can that be right in modern Britain in which we supposedly have equality?\" he asks.</p>",
  "<p>Roberto Di Matteo refused to condemn supporters who shout unacceptable abuse from the stands as he suggested it was commonplace at every stadium and had been for years, citing the example of his former Chelsea team-mate Graeme Le Saux, who routinely endured homophobic chants.</p> <p>Di Matteo's addiction to noncommittal answers led him into dangerous territory before the Premier League fixture against Manchester United at Stamford Bridge, when Rio Ferdinand could face hostility when he plays for the visitors over the support that he showed for his brother, Anton, in the John Terry racist slur saga. Ferdinand heard his every touch jeered in the corresponding fixture in February.</p> <p>Chelsea's players are set to wear Kick It Out T-shirts on Sunday and it was put to Di Matteo that, with emotions running high after Terry, the Chelsea captain, accepted a four-match domestic ban for racially abusing Anton Ferdinand, he might not want to see the booing of Rio Ferdinand. Di Matteo's answers, though, were shaped by a determination not to be seen to be criticising any Chelsea fans.</p> <p>\"I don't know how every single supporter will react,\" he said. \"Generally, our fans have been very respectful and very good in their behaviour. Don't forget, we get booed as well when we go away from home. It's not just focusing on our supporters. Our supporters have been generally very good.</p> <p>\"Hopefully, they will cheer us on and try to push us to win the game, more than anything.\"</p> <p>Di Matteo's reluctance to make a strong statement on offensive chanting was curious. \"I think you get that in every stadium,\" he said. \"It's happened with many players before. I remember when I was playing with Graeme Le Saux, he used to get booed a lot so \u2026 Some people feel that's right and some don't.\"</p> <p>Di Matteo was also asked whether Chelsea would support the Professional Footballers' Association's six-point plan to combat racism, drawn up in the wake of the Terry scandal, which would see players sacked for racist abuse.</p> <p>Chelsea fined Terry, who will use his programme notes on Sunday to state his support for the Kick It Out campaign, but did not consider dismissing him.</p> <p>\"It's a difficult one,\" Di Matteo said. \"If the majority believe that we need a law like that then we will obey it and support it. If it will become a rule, we will play by the rules, as we have always done. As a club, we are against any kind of discrimination and, if it does go through, then we will support it.\"</p> <p>Di Matteo described the United fixture as one of the season's \"classics\" but he will be without Frank Lampard, who has a calf strain that will rule him out for three weeks.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I am writing to express my concern at the poor service I have received from Willowbook, from whom I bought a mobility scooter in February.</strong></p> <p><strong>In July the scooter developed a fault. I called the customer services number three times before I was called back by a Willowbrook representative to arrange an engineer's visit. The \"engineer\" claimed it was an issue with \"bad cells\" in the batteries \u2013 but I knew this was wrong because I am a qualified engineering technician. Nevertheless, he claimed to have fixed it and left. </strong></p> <p><strong>A couple of weeks later, both indicator switches stopped working and the battery life was still poor, so I contacted customer services again. The scooter was collected and I was later advised they had not found any problems with it and it would be returned to me.</strong></p> <p><strong>Then in early September, as I was travelling along the road, the scooter suddenly made a nasty sound, reduced in speed and the battery indicator halved. I came to an abrupt stop and was nearly thrown out of my seat, causing a car following me to swerve to avoid hitting me. Can I get my money back? </strong><em>NB, London</em></p> <p>Your sorry tale is compounded by the fact you are a single parent living on benefits with an 18-month-old son and are unable to get out of your house without your scooter.</p> <p>You do have rights under the Sale of Goods Act if you buy an item that then develops a fault, but this is complicated by the amount of time you were able to successfully use the scooter. According to Which?, you would only be entitled to a full refund if the mobility scooter was found to be faulty when you first bought it, and if you had returned it to Willowbrook within a reasonable time with the intention of rejecting it.</p> <p>Which? says you may also be able to get your money back if you got little or no use out of the scooter and the repairs were unsuccessful. Your scooter worked for five months before it developed a fault. If you had asked for a refund at this point you would have been able to get one. Instead, you understandably agreed to repairs.</p> <p>You had had the scooter for seven months by the time it developed the second more serious fault. At this point, the company sent off the scooter \u2013 which was still under warranty \u2013 to the manufacturer and offered you a replacement scooter. You didn't want to accept, but according to David Foster, a partner at law firm Barlow Robbins, you don't have much choice because you have had your scooter too long to demand your money back.</p> <p>The company will not refund you the money but has replaced your scooter with a new one, apologised and sent you \u00a3100 as a goodwill gesture. If your scooter develops a fault in the next six months you will be able to demand a refund as your rights under the Sale of Goods Act start again with this new purchase.</p> <p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

  "<p>For the first eight months, I hid my pregnancy from my bosses, terrified it would spell the end of&#xa0;my career as a foreign correspondent. I simply didn't know any other women in the field with children. I flew to London for job interviews wearing loose-fitting clothes to hide my burgeoning bump. Being based in Malaysia for the BBC at the time made it a lot easier to keep secret from my employers, though I had to be careful about inhaling too much teargas in the weekly opposition street protests. Only when I was offered a role as a&#xa0;roving reporter in Europe did I&#xa0;come clean, since by then I was no longer legally allowed to fly.</p> <p>The reaction from colleagues was a little disturbing. One male journalist admitted he'd always assumed I couldn't have children because I'd left it so late (34 years). Female colleagues muttered in corridors, asking how I was going to&#xa0;manage such a demanding job and a child.</p> <p>I had indeed delayed getting pregnant because it seemed impossible to combine with foreign reporting, but a rebellious streak in me felt missing out on having children was too high a price to pay for an exciting career, and not fair on my husband.</p> <p>Two months after giving birth, I was posted as the BBC correspondent to Sri Lanka, which was in the midst of a vicious civil war. I'd seen my fair share of horror, poverty and bearded men with guns, but this time I found myself packing milk bottles and washable nappies as well as a&#xa0;flak jacket, helmet and first aid kit. It was the start of a&#xa0;double life as foreign correspondent and mother.</p> <p>We arrived in Sri Lanka in 2000, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/980489.stm\" title=\"\">just after the BBC's local reporter in Jaffna had been killed in a&#xa0;grenade attack on his home</a> in a government-controlled town. It is a&#xa0;murder that remains unsolved, like many others in Sri Lanka over the decades. One of my first tasks was to work out what&#xa0;to do about his widow, still numb with shock,&#xa0;and her three young children. My baby grew into a toddler while my colleague's terrified family waited to escape abroad to start all over again on icy shores.</p> <p>Having just created life, it was strange to spend so much time dealing with death. As a mother, I&#xa0;found it harder to fathom the extraordinary cruelty otherwise gentle people are capable of in wars. At night in Sri Lanka, I would sit under the ceiling fan and rock my tiny baby to sleep in my arms, haunted by the stories I&#xa0;reported by day: tales of torture, mass graves and the agony of the missing fighters' mothers who never received a&#xa0;corpse to mourn. Both sides reeled out casualty statistics like cricket scores, forgetting the people they talked about were once someone's baby, loved and protected. It made it hard to get excited about the military hardware side of war \u2013 it didn't matter much if it was a T56 or AK-47 that did the killing. In&#xa0;the male-dominated world of foreign reporting I&#xa0;never admitted it, but motherhood did bring a&#xa0;new perspective to the story.</p> <p>The capital Colombo was full of soldiers and the talk on the streets was of suicide bombers, but it was an otherwise safe city where normal life continued in spite of the war in the distance. The violence was both random and targeted, but my baby was at home so unlikely to be caught up in a&#xa0;bombing on the streets \u2013 and in a targeted attack it would be me, not him, they'd be after.</p> <p>Because of my job, we had bomb film plastered over our windows lest someone lobbed a grenade over the walls. The BBC sent a retired MI6 officer to check my security arrangements. He placed video cameras on the gate and barbed wire around the perimeter, and hired round-the-clock guards. Only once did I feel worried for my son's safety, after strange people had been calling and lurking about the house at a tense time politically. To&#xa0;be on the safe side, my husband and I took him with us to a dinner that night, full of journalists and politicians. The media minister, who clearly thought me a&#xa0;pain, mellowed when he saw I was a mother.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398426920\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351083298584/Frances-Harrison-with-her-008.jpg\" alt=\"Frances Harrison with her son\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frances and her son: 'Having just created life, it\u00a0was strange to spend so much time dealing with\u00a0death.' Photograph: Courtesy of Frances Harrison</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Frances Harrison</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I set things up so my office was in the garden, and employed two nannies who took it in turns to be with my son for 24 hours at a time. It was a&#xa0;bizarre arrangement, but it gave them time to sort out their own lives and enabled me to be permanently on call. My bosses never discussed my unusual status as mother and correspondent. An obsession with equality made it impossible for them to know how to navigate such uncharted territory. Managers regularly asked me at very short notice to travel for weeks at a time; not once did it cross my mind to refuse, convinced that I'd never be asked again. I missed my son when I travelled, but the trips were exciting and I knew he was well looked after.</p> <p>When the rebels attacked the country's only international airport in 2001, I was on air almost solidly for three days. My child would cry when I&#xa0;dashed into the house to get something to eat, because I didn't have time to spend with him. But&#xa0;there were slack periods that compensated, and when I travelled abroad he would sweetly kiss the TV screen when he saw me on air.</p> <p>My husband was a roving correspondent for CNN then, often away, too, but we agreed one of us would always be with our child at night if the other was travelling, and we wouldn't take the same flight to war areas lest the plane be shot down. One parent was not ideal, but better than none.</p> <p>If my husband was already abroad and I was given an assignment, my son came with me. After 9/11, when he was one year old, I took him to India on an open-ended trip. When the call came from London, I'd just that day sacked the nanny. Somehow I found a replacement, got her a visa and left the next morning. In Delhi, the wives of colleagues generously invited my son to join their playgroup and kept an eye on the new nanny. The hotel filled our room with balloons and the chef made special meals that we mashed up in a small food processor, spreading a&#xa0;large sheet on the floor to protect the carpet. At one point my husband flew in from Iran, where he was reporting, just to babysit for a weekend so I could go off to Kashmir, which was not a place to take a child at that time. Three months of living in a hotel gave my son a&#xa0;lifelong fondness for room service; unable to talk, he learned to point at the telephone when hungry.</p> <p>Twice I took my child and nanny to Pakistan, where I worked for a month at a time. On the first trip, when he was 16 months old, we were put in a&#xa0;communal guesthouse the BBC had hired in Islamabad for the influx of reporters. Surprisingly, female colleagues seemed more uneasy than the men about the baby's presence. When a&#xa0;Pakistani reporter overheard women reporters and producers backbiting about how ridiculous it was that I travelled with my nanny and baby, he invited us to stay with his family instead.</p> <p>Occasionally, my husband and I did leave our son at home when big stories broke. In 2003, when an earthquake killed 30,000 people in Bam, southern Iran, we both ran out of the door to the airport, leaving the child in Sri Lanka with my stunned mother, who'd been visiting for Christmas.</p> <p>In 2004, when my son was four, I became the first female BBC bureau chief in Iran. He was very upset about leaving Colombo and in the month we spent in transit in London, refused to eat food that wasn't Sri Lankan. He felt he belonged there, and when strangers asked where he came from he&#xa0;would answer that his mum was English, his dad Iranian and he was Sri Lankan. We lured him to Tehran by promising skiing and snow \u2013 a thrill for any child brought up in the tropics.</p> <p>Being a woman reporter in Iran was difficult enough without being a mother. As a woman, you lived the discrimination every day. In the president's office, journalists were taken to the canteen for lunch while waiting for a press conference, but as the only woman I was escorted away to eat on my own on a different floor. The hardline Basij militia wouldn't allow me inside their bases. Lowly security officials at the Iranian foreign ministry delighted in ordering me to pull my headscarf tighter around my forehead.</p> <p>Some Iranian officials seemed to know childcare was my achilles heel. I had struggled to find any Iranian who'd work the hours I did, so eventually I brought our Sri Lankan nanny to Tehran, flying her home three times a year to keep her sane. After Ahmadinejad came to power, the Iranian immigration department abruptly decided not to renew her work permit. She was given a week to leave. The government said it would provide a&#xa0;nanny to live with us \u2013 or rather to spy on us. I&#xa0;made a huge fuss and somehow ensured her stay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398426921\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351083541740/Frances-Harrison-with-her-008.jpg\" alt=\"Frances Harrison with her husband\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frances Harrison with her husband.  Photograph: Mohsen Shandiz</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mohsen Shandiz</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The authorities in Tehran also refused to give my husband a press card to work as a journalist, even though he was originally Iranian. This put pressure on all of us. Children find it very hard to accept such unfairness. I told my worried son that the government didn't like Daddy because he told the truth. Then he quite logically asked why \"they\" didn't have a&#xa0;problem with me, too.</p> <p>There were of course people abroad \u2013 as well as in Iran \u2013 who didn't like the fact that the BBC had sent a woman to Tehran. A picture appeared on the internet of a woman with a noose round her neck that was supposed to be me. The accompanying article implied I was a traitor to Britain and claimed my husband routinely beat me up to make sure I&#xa0;reported stories favourable to the regime.</p> <p>I worried terribly about what would happen to my son if one of us was arrested. Being married to an Iranian, I had to work on an Iranian passport, which offered no consular protection. If I got into trouble, I wouldn't be deported; at the very least, I'd have my passport confiscated. One week, my son's swimming teacher told me the word on the grapevine was that I was in the notorious Evin jail after a particularly risqu\u00e9 story. On another occasion I was taken to a revolutionary court as the criminally accused in a libel case that had nothing to do with my reporting. I had sleepless nights imagining how my child would cope if I was found guilty and put in prison. In revolutionary Iran, any minor court case could quickly snowball out of control if it involved a foreigner. The judge wasn't reassuring; his first move was to ask me what religion I was. Later, after the disputed 2009 elections, it felt as if almost every journalist we'd ever interviewed ended up in prison or exile.</p> <p>In 2007, we returned to London, needing a dose of normal life. I looked for foreign postings that would work for my husband's career and our child. A BBC manager asked if I'd contemplated Kabul. When I said I needed a place with a good school for a seven-year-old, he told me I'd limited my options by having a family. So&#xa0;I&#xa0;left the corporation, did another degree and stumbled into <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781846274695\" title=\"\">writing books</a>.</p> <p>After me, a few more women correspondents have had children \u2013 one even as a single mother of two in Uzbekistan. But since the BBC appointed its first woman to the job in 1986, most have been unmarried and/or childless.</p> <p>Like any working mother, I feel perpetual guilt, always wondering if I have done my best for my child. Umpteen bedtime stories were abandoned as the phone rang with a breaking story. Quite a&#xa0;few holidays were cut short, and countless family lunches and outings cancelled because of a new development that London was getting excited about. Recently, a stream of refugee journalists from repressive regimes have eaten up my spare time, which my son sometimes feels should belong to him. When I explain their stories, he understands why I want to help them. These sacrifices are nothing compared with those of some people I've met through working.</p> <p>For me, what it means to be a good mother is defined by the women I interviewed for my book on the horrific end to the civil war in Sri Lanka. At the height of the fighting in 2009, hundreds of thousands of civilians were shelled and bombed while hiding in flimsy earthen ditches. Mothers used their bodies to protect children from the flying shards of deadly metal. Dying women gave their babies one last breastfeed, knowing they'd otherwise starve in a place where milk cost more than gold. And some discussed suicide together because they couldn't bear to be separated.</p> <p>One Tamil widow I met has a daughter the same age as my son. The child lost half her body weight in five months from starvation. Surviving against all odds, the mother crawled under barbed wire in the middle of the night with her children to escape an army detention camp, only to get lost in the jungle. She hid in different safe houses every night, dodged rebel informers and somehow reached the unlikely sanctuary of New Malden in south London, where she immediately settled down to prepare her eldest child for the 11-plus school entrance exam. By day it was verbal reasoning, but by night she would comfort her daughter when she woke up screaming because she feared she was back in the war zone. These brave, strong women put the trials of motherhood in perspective.</p> <p>\u2022 Frances Harrison's book, Still Counting The Dead: Survivors Of Sri Lanka's Hidden War, is published by Portobello Books at \u00a314.99.

  "<h2><strong>Freelancing has left me drained and with no sense of direction</strong></h2> <p><strong>I'm nearing 40 and work in the cultural sector. About three years ago my role was made redundant while I was on maternity leave. I didn't find a job, was offered freelance work, and so went down that route. But I'm becoming increasingly worn out because: there is very little separation between work and home; the nature of freelance involves endless applications; doing work at short notice; trying to be as flexible as possible around part-time childcare; and no security.</strong></p> <p><strong>I need a sense of direction \u2013 and perhaps an escape route \u2013 now. I don't want to be that person who used to be quite good but lost their edge, but I don't want to work full-time while my child is small. When I look at jobs outside my immediate sector I struggle to see how my experience qualifies me \u2013 am I stuck in this sector forever? What else could I be good at? I can't afford to stop work or to retrain.</strong></p> <p><strong>I miss working in a team and being part of an organisation \u2013 I enjoyed the camaraderie and, of course, the relative stability of a monthly salary. From the things I'm doing now, I enjoy researching and writing, and the small amount of teaching I do, though I feel pressured by the limited amount of time in which to try to do a good job.</strong></p> <p><strong> Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>I'm not going to try to identify other occupations that you might \"escape\" to. You can't afford to retrain; I don't know nearly enough about you; and, anyway, I'm far from convinced that a total change of direction is your best course of action. From an analysis of your letter, it seems to me that virtually all your disillusionment springs not from the essential nature of your work, but from the circumstances in which you find yourself.</p> <p>You badly miss being part of a team. You miss the camaraderie. You find the incursion of work time on home time deeply wearing. Your need to make endless applications, few of which bring positive results, depresses you still further. All this, entirely understandably, has affected your enthusiasm for the job you do. You fear you've lost your drive \u2013 and that younger people may be better at the work than you are.</p> <p>I have to say that I doubt it. I think you feel trapped and tired. I think you need not so much a new job, as a new way of doing your existing job. Relieved of some of the loneliness and administrative burden, I believe you'd soon regain your appetite for work that, even now, you know you can not only do well, but greatly enjoy.</p> <p>You've sometimes worked with another colleague, so think positively about building on this. In all sorts of sectors, freelancers have benefited from forming themselves into groups \u2013 co-operatives, formal or informal \u2013 and then actively marketing themselves. If you've got a couple of like-minded colleagues, sound them out. Think of a name for yourselves; design some letter headings; write a proposal for prospective clients and I believe the weight of pessimism will lift.</p> <p>Despite the additional work it would involve, I'm fairly certain you'd find that to have a clear objective (your \"sense of direction\") would lighten your spirits immediately; as would the company of others with whom to share that objective \u2013 and the setbacks and successes it will inevitably entail.</p> <p><strong>Readers say</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Have you considered writing funding applications? You need to be able to assimilate a lot of information about an organisation and their activities relatively quickly and write persuasively, which may suit your current experience. It's a skill-set that's valuable not just in the cultural sector but across the third sector and higher education, and you could start off on a freelance basis while your child is young. <strong>babybat</strong></p> <p>\u2022 It doesn't have to be how you describe \u2013 you can find clients and places to work with who are happy to work on longer-term contracts. Often, that's just about contacts. Perhaps you need a little mentoring and a business plan. That will help you feel like you're working towards something. Without a plan or a goal you can feel a little bit out of control. There are regular networking events you can go to for the camaraderie \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.uk-jelly.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Jelly</a> is a good one. <strong>Brownie23</strong></p> <h2><strong>How can I turn my 'gap years' into a sensible career in tourism?</strong></h2> <p><strong>I am currently concentrating on \"living the dream\". Since graduating from university in 2010 with a 2:1 in Chinese and French I have worked in tourism as a ski resort manager for a major tour operator in the winter, and as a sailing instructor in the summer. While I am currently very happy with both roles and the lifestyle that comes with them, I am aware they do not pay salaries I will ever be able to retire on, and I'm not getting any younger.</strong></p> <p><strong>I have keen interests in the development of tourism in China and in the development and retail of sports equipment; both of which I consider to be sensible prospects carried out by large organisations. What would your and readers' advice be on making the transition to a more \"adult\" career, and how should I go about taking this&#xa0;step?</strong></p> <p><strong>How are my numerous gap years going to look to future employers, and by what age should I be looking to make the change?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>You're asking all the right questions at the right time. Only two years out of university, no prospective employer is going to think you've been a serious drifter. In another few years, they might. Of the two interests you mention, I would have thought that the development of tourism in China was the more promising.</p> <p>With your knowledge of Chinese and your experience as a resort manager, you should be able to present your credentials easily enough and impressively enough to attract the interest of any company involved with tourism in China.</p> <p>The sooner you start looking the better. Even if you continue to \"live the dream\" for another year or two, future potential employers will be reassured that you started planning ahead much earlier.</p> <p><strong>Readers say</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Tour operators almost certainly have \"grown up\" career progression paths too. Talk to your managers at both institutions and ask them about career progression and what roles are available for people experienced in the slopes/areas of the sea where you work every year. Most of us sell out to an office employer because we never have the opportunity to work in fun environments, not because it's somehow better. <strong>BobJanova</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Think about the \"major tour operator\" you already work for in the ski job \u2013 it sounds like they've had you back for a couple of seasons, and perhaps promoted you to a manager role, so you have good credibility and maybe contacts there. <strong>asasasas</strong></p> <p><strong>For Jeremy's and readers' advice on a work issue, send a brief email to </strong><a href=\"mailto:dear.jeremy@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong>dear.jeremy@theguardian.com</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000422/\" title=\"\">John Goodman</a> sits on the couch, immobile as Mount Rushmore, his forearms parked aboard meaty knees. Fishing responses from him is like chipping at granite. He says, \"No, sir\" and, \"I don't know\"; \"I suppose\" and, \"I&#xa0;wouldn't know about that.\" From time to time, he emits a&#xa0;long, breathy groan, as though invisible doctors are subjecting him to some invasive medical procedure. I don't know whether he's exhausted or sick; whether he hates interviews or this particular interviewer. On balance, with the benefit of hindsight, I&#xa0;decide it's all four of these things with the gas turned up.</p> <p>It is perhaps unfair to expect an actor to put on a show when the cameras aren't rolling. But after barely five minutes, I'm floundering, rattling through the questions, desperately attempting to snag his interest. Clearly, there is no sign of the joie de vivre Goodman brought to his role as earthy, expansive Dan Conner through nine seasons of Roseanne. Nor, for that matter, is there much evidence of the playful gusto and twinkling intelligence he smuggles into even his most baleful screen incarnations (volcanic Walter Sobchak in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/\" title=\"\">The Big Lebowski</a>, the one-eyed Bible salesman out of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190590/\" title=\"\">O Brother, Where Art Thou?</a>). Forgive the preconceptions: I walked in to meet a warm, funny, abundantly gifted actor whose work I've loved for years. Instead, this feels like dinner with Grendel.</p> <p>Goodman is here to promote his role in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/benaffleck\" title=\"\">Ben Affleck</a>'s new movie, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/07/argo-ben-affleck-review\" title=\"\">Argo</a>, though he's not in town for long, \"no, sir.\" The film itself is punchy and involving; a stranger-than-fiction account of&#xa0;Hollywood's deep-cover role in the Iranian hostage crisis that helped unseat the Carter administration. Affleck stars as CIA operative Tony Mendez, who concocts a fake movie as a&#xa0;means of springing six Americans who have gone to ground at the Canadian embassy in Tehran. Goodman plays the late John Chambers, a&#xa0;makeup artist best known for designing the masks on the original Planet Of The Apes pictures. Chambers' task is to cook up a sci-fi production that looks legit, passing off the imperilled Americans as workaday film-makers who have come to Iran to scout for locations. Don't worry, Chambers assures Mendez at one stage, \"You can teach a rhesus monkey to be a&#xa0;director in a day.\"</p> <p>I ask Goodman what research he did into the real-life Chambers and he heaves a heavy sigh. \"I&#xa0;didn't have much to go on or much time to do it. I just read a couple of things. Spoke to a couple of people who knew him. There wasn't really much to do. The script was self-explanatory.\"</p> <p>Did he perhaps base the character on any Hollywood crew members he's known in the past? Chambers, after all, is one of Hollywood's working Joes; the unsung heroes of film production. \"I'm a working Joe myself,\" Goodman says. \"A cog in the machine.\" So&#xa0;he feels a&#xa0;certain affinity with men such as Chambers? Goodman grimaces into the middle distance. He can't think what I mean. Well, I&#xa0;elaborate, he describes himself as a working Joe\u2026</p> <p>\"Do I?\" Goodman barks. \"Do I? Ah, well, if you&#xa0;say so.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398468443\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351077747005/John-Goodman-and-Ben-Affl-008.jpg\" alt=\"John Goodman and Ben Affleck in Argo\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Ben Affleck's new movie Argo, about Hollywood's role in the Iranian hostage crisis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By this point I sense we might have danced ourselves giddy with our chat about Argo, although I'm not quite sure where we go from here. Goodman seems so jaded, so hostile, so barely engaged that speaking to him has become a&#xa0;little unnerving. Is he feeling all right? \"Yes, sir.\" Can I get him some water? \"No, sir,\" he says and then waves me to continue.</p> <p>He was born in St Louis in 1952, to a waitress mum and a postman dad who died when he was two. He liked football as a boy, and played a little in college. Now he says that he was never that good; it would not have worked out. Acting, he claims, was the only thing he could do, and he had no plan B. He liked the idea of being <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/marlonbrando\" title=\"\">Marlon Brando</a>; he loved that whole method school of acting. \"Brando was different. He changed the world. He was the beginning and end of his own revolution.\" Is that what inspired Goodman, what fired him up? \"Yeah, I suppose.\" He laughs mirthlessly. \"Gee, I wish I could still get fired up.\"</p> <p>I had the impression that Goodman struggled during his early years as an actor, but he insists that this was not really the case \u2013 he was always able to pick up work. In his 20s, he acted on Broadway and cropped up on TV, bagging his first screen appearance as a hungry diner in a Burger King commercial. In the meantime, he was chasing the&#xa0;dream in 1980s New York, jockeying for position among a bunch of other young actors. \"Bruce Willis was a bartender at a place I used to&#xa0;go,\" he&#xa0;says, briefly illuminated by the memory. \"He was a great bartender, it was a&#xa0;performance every night. He&#xa0;just had the crowd&#xa0;in the palm of&#xa0;his hand. Ah, Bruce, he was great. He got me the drinks and I drank 'em down.\"</p> <p>In 1988, Goodman secured what would prove to be his breakthrough role. Roseanne Barr's portrait of a loving, scratchy, blue-collar family, struggling to get by in Lanford, Illinois, amounted to a&#xa0;roustabout salute to the real America, depicting a landscape of chintzy furnishings and ranch-style kitchens that was worlds away from Wall Street or Beverly Hills, though Goodman won't be drawn on the show's political impact. \"I was just showing up and doing my job,\" he says. \"And if I&#xa0;thought I was making some sort of statement, then I was in the wrong fucking business.\"</p> <p>Roseanne's on-screen fireworks sometimes spilled over on to the set as well. Life on the show could be fraught and demanding, driven with an iron hand by Barr herself, who oversaw the scripts and brought her then-husband, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Arnold_%28actor%29\" title=\"\">Tom Arnold</a>, to serve as executive producer. Still, the show topped the ratings and made Goodman a&#xa0;star. \"It was strange,\" he admits. \"I saw the world differently. I guess there was a sense of entitlement. People treated me differently and I&#xa0;got used to it. It's not pleasant to look back on right now.\"</p> <p>How does he look back on the show itself? \"Happily, now. It was great fun at first and then it was trouble. At times, it was hard to go to work.\"</p> <p>What was the trouble? \"A lot of individual things. She had fallen in love with this guy and brought him along and this kind of upset the balance. But, you know\u2026\" He gives an epic shrug. \"Everybody got along. It was like this big dysfunctional family.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398468444\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351078166676/Roseanne-008.jpg\" alt=\"Roseanne\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goodman in TV comedy Roseanne. Photograph: Moviestore Collection/Rex</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore Collection/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the years since Roseanne, Goodman has gone on to establish a&#xa0;rich, rewarding film career: sometimes as a leading man, more often as a&#xa0;galvanising support player, a safe pair of hands, a rock to anchor the ship. He played the US president on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Ht_zrRi5A\" title=\"\">The West Wing</a> and the monarch of&#xa0;England in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSHYS1RabYo\" title=\"\">King Ralph</a>. He reared up brilliantly&#xa0;through five collaborations with the Coen brothers, and rustled up a beautiful, heartbreaking turn as shaggy James P \"Sulley\" Sullivan in the animated <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvOQeozL4S0\" title=\"\">Monsters Inc</a>. All of which was a just reward for hard graft and talent. And yet what should have been his vintage years&#xa0;were also blighted by increasingly heavy drinking. In 2007, Goodman checked into a&#xa0;rehabilitation centre to get himself sober.</p> <p>\"It was getting to be too much,\" he tells me. \"It&#xa0;was 30 years of a disease that was taking its toll on everyone around me and it had got to the point where, every time I did it, it was becoming more and more debilitating. It was life or death. It&#xa0;was time to stop.\"</p> <p>Was the alcohol affecting his work? \"Yes, it certainly was.\"</p> <p>In what respect? \"Erm,\" he says. \"Temperament. Memory. Depression.\"</p> <p>All at once he swivels on the couch and stares off at the wall. He is silent for the longest time. His&#xa0;jaw is set, his colour is rising. Finally, he speaks: \"This is not something I want to chat about to sell a fucking movie. You understand? I&#xa0;don't know what you do. I'm sorry, I'm very tired. It&#xa0;seems a&#xa0;little cheap to me.\"</p> <p>OK, I say. I'm sorry if I've offended you. \"It's not your fault, it's the process,\" he says. \"I can't just waltz in here and talk about the movie, I&#xa0;have to dredge up some very unpleasant things and it's just not worth it. What's the fucking point?\"</p> <p>Goodman admits that he has sometimes used work as a distraction from all the other, swirling aspects of his life, and possibly as a means of controlling them, too. He explains that he likes acting because it involves working with good people. He likes shooting with the Coen brothers best of all, he says, because their scripts are so good they're practically foolproof, which effectively removes him from the equation: \"Which works for me.\" When a film isn't going well, it makes him very \"antsy\". When there's no film to work on, he gets antsier still \u2013 although he says he's working on that, it's part of a process. Last summer, he had some time on his hands, so he just ended up hanging out at home with Anna, his wife of 23 years. He fixed the house, read some books, watched a little baseball. \"I&#xa0;wound up rather enjoying myself,\" he says with surprise.</p> <p>At some stage he'd like to do more theatre. But&#xa0;right now he has an arthritic left knee that is&#xa0;in need of repair and a heap of new films poised&#xa0;to roll off the rank. Argo, for instance, is&#xa0;already being tipped as a potential Oscar contender, just as Michel Hazanavicius's silent-screen comedy <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK7pfLlsUQM\" title=\"\">The Artist</a> was last year. The actor shakes his head. He still can't get over what happened with The Artist, in which he took a&#xa0;small role as a&#xa0;Hollywood mogul. He agreed to appear in the thing only because it sounded like a neat idea, plus he didn't need to learn the lines. \"I&#xa0;thought it would be a nice little film that nobody would see.\"</p> <p>But that's the thing about this business, he shrugs. You can never predict which film will take&#xa0;off and which one will bomb. \"If I could do that, I&#xa0;wouldn't be sitting in this room. I'd be at a&#xa0;desk the size of a football pitch. Barking orders, or having someone else bark 'em for me. One thing's for sure: I wouldn't be sitting here with you, my friend.\"</p> <p>Afterwards, a little bruised from the encounter, I email Roseanne Barr for her thoughts on Goodman. I&#xa0;ask her about their working relationship on the set of Roseanne, about what aspects he brought to the role of Dan Conner. What I most want to know, I think, is what he's like as a person when he's off screen and relaxed, when he feels loved and fulfilled.</p> <p>Barr emails back straight away: \"John is the funniest and deepest actor in the world,\" she says. \"He has only gotten more open, more sweet, more expansive and giving, on-screen and off, if that were possible, since the Roseanne show.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Argo goes on general release on 7&#xa0;November.</p>",
  "<p>My wife is away again. Over the course of her absence, she sends me a few texts asking how the children are, but it is not a&#xa0;good&#xa0;week for knowing that sort of&#xa0;thing: on two mornings I am out of the house before they wake up; on two nights I do not get home until they are in bed.</p> <p>\"They seem fine,\" I text back. To be honest, the evidence of my children's presence is largely archaeological \u2013 crusted plates lying next to computers, socks on the stairs \u2013 but nothing I find points to anything being amiss. I wish I could say the same for the little dog.</p> <p>The little dog's chronic separation anxiety does not normally extend to me, because I never go anywhere. But this week, in violation of long established boundaries, I wake two nights running to find it sleeping on my head like a hat.</p> <p>The third day's schedule is entirely given over to chores and errands that should have been completed in the first two. I am in the supermarket when I receive a&#xa0;text from my wife reminding me to&#xa0;go to the tailor's, and asking if I&#xa0;have given the little dog its skin&#xa0;complaint pills. \"The dog has&#xa0;fleas, not disease,\" I text back. It&#xa0;is possible, even likely, that the dog has both fleas and disease, but&#xa0;I&#xa0;want it to sound as if I am on&#xa0;top of&#xa0;things.</p> <p>On the third night, I am woken by&#xa0;the little dog staring at me while thumping its tail on the floor. I look at the clock: it's 4.30am.</p> <p>\"What do you want?\" I ask.</p> <p>The dog rolls on to its back and bares its tiny front teeth.</p> <p>\"Oh God,\" I say. \"Why are you apologising? What have you done?\"</p> <p>I find the turd on the floor in my wife's office, sitting in a square of pale light from a distant streetlamp. This makes no sense. The little dog can go outside whenever it wants; it&#xa0;fits through the cat flap. I clean up&#xa0;the mess and go back to bed. The little dog collapses in supplication as&#xa0;I pass it on the stairs.</p> <p>\"I'm not interested in your issues,\" I tell it.</p> <p>The next night I take both dogs out to the park at 11pm, and then demonstrate the swinging action of the cat flap for the little dog's benefit. At 4.30 I hear its tail thumping against the floor. I find a&#xa0;puddle of urine on the landing.</p> <p>The following evening I'm due at a&#xa0;charity quiz, an invitation I&#xa0;accepted long before I knew my wife would be away, and also before I knew it was black tie. \"How do I&#xa0;look?\" I say to the middle one.</p> <p>\"Like a twat,\" he says, before shouting, \"Oops!\" and clapping his hand over his mouth. Looking in the mirror, I see what he means: my new secondhand dinner jacket has been taken in so much that the pockets are on the back. I check my hairline for fleas and leave.</p> <p>At 4.30 I am woken by the thumping tail, but I am too tired to&#xa0;open both eyes.</p> <p>\"I don't care,\" I say. \"Go away.\"</p> <p>The children have left for school by the time I rise. Downstairs I&#xa0;find&#xa0;the archaeological remains of&#xa0;some kind of ransacking: the contents of the refrigerator seem to&#xa0;have exploded across the kitchen.&#xa0;But I also discover evidence&#xa0;of a&#xa0;primitive form of cooperation: an attempt has been made to empty the dishwasher, and&#xa0;also to make brownies. Both,&#xa0;sadly, have failed. I&#xa0;have three&#xa0;hours to clean it all up before my wife gets home, not counting the time it will take me to find today's turd.</p>",
  "<p>This week's column isn't principally for existing beer lovers, but for those who think they don't like or aren't remotely interested in beer. Well, think again, because a&#xa0;revolution is taking place in British brewing that is resulting in beers unlike any we've ever tasted.</p> <p>I tried a good few of them at the <a href=\"http://www.indymanbeercon.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Independent Manchester Beer Convention</a> the other week, a joyous, two-day event held in the crumbling splendour of the Victoria Baths. Anything went: keg beers sat alongside cask, fresh chillies were being infused into chocolate stout (by Bitches Brewing Co), food included a Michelin-standard beer dinner (from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/aug/28/restaurant-review-aumbry-prestwich\" title=\"\">Aumbry</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.visitmanchester.com/articles/attractions/rusholme/\" title=\"\">Curry Mile-style</a> cheesy peas. The brewers were present to talk to the punters, who were largely under-35s and, at a&#xa0;guess, at least 30% women. Beers were poured in&#xa0;third-pint measures, so you could&#xa0;try more.</p> <p>Many of the fledgling breweries come from Yorkshire, which seems to be the epicentre of the new craft beer movement. The <a href=\"http://www.summerwinebrewery.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Summer Wine Brewery</a> of Holmfirth, for instance, was pouring exotic, dark, hoppy <a href=\"http://shop.summerwinebrewery.co.uk/cohort---double-black-belgian-rye-pa-75-abv-330ml-36-p.asp\" title=\"\"><strong>Cohort Double Black Belgian Rye PA</strong></a> (\u00a32.59; 7.5% abv) made with rye malt, American hops and Belgian yeast.</p> <p>The Henley-on-Thames-based <a href=\"http://www.lovibonds.com/\" title=\"\">Lovibonds</a> brewery, which has been playing around with Belgian-style sour beers, came up with an intensely refreshing, barrel-aged wheat beer called <a href=\"http://lovibonds.com/ourbeers.php\" title=\"\"><strong>Sour Grapes</strong></a>, which recently won a gold in the World Beer Awards (think sour-citrus, not sour-off); it's set shortly to release a limited edition of 500 bottles direct from the brewery (\u00a315 a full-size bottle; 6% abv).</p> <p>And there was, of course, <a href=\"http://www.brewdog.com/\" title=\"\">BrewDog</a> \u2013 still only five years old, but already a veteran of the craft beer scene, whose latest, <a href=\"http://www.brewdog.com/product/hello-my-name-is-beastie\" title=\"\"><strong>Hello, My Name Is Beastie</strong></a> (long story; check out the website), is a delicious, bramble-infused double IPA (\u00a32.69, or three for \u00a37.59; 8.2% abv) that would be great with autumnal roasts.</p> <p>Even while I've been writing this piece, a couple of new breweries have started up, including <a href=\"http://wildbeerco.com/\" title=\"\">the Wild Beer Co</a> in Somerset, which has just made a gorgeous, almost caramelly saison-style beer called <strong>Epic Saison</strong> (\u00a32.80, <a href=\"http://www.corksof.com/\" title=\"\">Corks of Cotham, Bristol</a>; 5%&#xa0;abv), which would be perfect with the Christmas (or Thanksgiving) turkey.</p> <p>The best place to discover craft beers is obviously a pub or bar.

I tend to make small allowances when I can \u2013 for instance, cutting down on carbs by taking one layer of bread off a&#xa0;sandwich. I also exercise every day, even if it's just a short run. I'm tasting and developing dishes all the&#xa0;time \u2013 we can have around 500 dishes in development at any one time between <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/the-fat-duck\" title=\"\">the Fat Duck</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dinnerbyheston.com/\" title=\"\">Dinner</a>, Waitrose and <a href=\"http://www.hindsheadbray.com/\" title=\"\">the two</a> <a href=\"http://www.thecrownatbray.com/\" title=\"\">pubs</a>, and that's not including the food for the TV work, so when I'm not filming, I'm kind of constantly eating/tasting. This has been an interesting exercise, though \u2013 I've never really analysed what I eat or drink. I guess I need to organise breakfast better, and I'm quite famous for drinking my body weight in Earl Grey tea, but&#xa0;the rest is just madness.</p> <p><strong>Sunday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Filming this morning, so&#xa0;just had a quick Earl Grey tea.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Tuna sandwich\u2026 from a&#xa0;shop&#xa0;somewhere.</p> <p><strong>Dinner</strong> Sunday lunch \u2013 well, kind of lunch/dinner by the time I got home. I think it was about 8.30pm, so that makes it officially Sunday dinner. A roast, of course! Dorset lamb this week. I always try to have a Sunday joint with all the trimmings \u2013 it's one of my favourite meals of the week.</p> <p><strong>Monday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Early morning phone interview with Australia and a cup&#xa0;of tea (Earl Grey with skimmed&#xa0;milk).</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Lunch? Not today\u2026 : (</p> <p><strong>Dinner </strong>Filming at the BBC studios for Jimmy Carr's Channel 4 show <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/8-out-of-10-cats\" title=\"\">8 Out Of 10 Cats</a> \u2013 great night, hilarious, but was up early, then straight off to filming and hadn't eaten all day. Arrived at the BBC starving \u2013 big mistake (dried-out meatballs) washed down with a few glasses (slightly warm pinot grigio). Delicious!?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398955392\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351100602071/Food-diary-Heston-008.jpg\" alt=\"Food diary: Heston\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A taste of Heston Blumenthal's week\u2026 Photograph: Heston Blumenthal</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heston Blumenthal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>My new TV series is out mid-November and we're still filming \u2013 cutting it neat! Had bacon butties to start the day off, cooked in the engine of a&#xa0;steam train \u2013 why&#xa0;not?</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Lunch was a bigger affair, but&#xa0;at least had packed my lunchbox. Grabbed some veg from the catering van, too.</p> <p><strong>Dinner </strong>Popped into the amazing <a href=\"http://www.zumarestaurant.com/zuma-landing/london/en/welcome\" title=\"\">Zuma</a> with my youngest, Joy,&#xa0;for her birthday. We were too full for dessert, so they just sent a little something.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Waitrose tasting for new hot cross buns for next Easter \u2013 Earl Grey jasmine tea and orange-flower water versus ginger and acacia honey. May sound nice, but had to taste brussels sprout leaves&#xa0;cooked in different ways at the same time.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Lunch at the lab: yoghurt and tampons. We were testing the effect of certain foods and how they coat the palate for an interactive presentation. The tampon dries the saliva out between spoonfuls, so you can identify how the tongue perceives flavour. It did work, but I&#xa0;wonder how it will go down.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Snack </strong>Everything is getting bigger for the new programme. We supersize everything, and cook and eat it with different communities throughout the UK. Things like afternoon tea and old sweets. Not sure where the huge whisky gum came from, but I think I know someone at the lab who knows.</p> <p><strong>Tea </strong>We have a lab grade centrifuge, a&#xa0;distillator, a rotary evaporator, vacuum centrifuge, vac packs, water baths\u2026 But no bloody kettle. A very complex cup of tea.</p> <p><strong>Dinner </strong>After a full day in Bray and a&#xa0;brainstorm meeting that overran, ended up in the garden of <a href=\"http://www.thecrownatbray.com/\" title=\"\">the Crown</a> for fish and chips \u2013 took the opportunity as a rare warm evening.</p> <p><strong>Thursday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Book signing back in office \u2013 finally a decent cup of tea, ahhh, found teapot.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Spent most of the day at <a href=\"http://www.dinnerbyheston.com/\" title=\"\">Dinner</a>. Meeting with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/jan/23/heston-blumenthal-palmer-watts-interview\" title=\"\">Ash</a> to discuss a new project \u2013 a historic British food book \u2013 and trying to get a&#xa0;modern \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/dec/02/heston-blumenthal-christmas-canapes-meat\" title=\"\">meat fruit</a>\" shot to contrast with the historic image. Lunch was a tasting of new dishes: new terrine, autumn tart and sambonade \u2013 a goat's cheese cheesecake with elderflower and a&#xa0;secret centre.</p> <p><strong>Dinner </strong>Stayed and had dinner with a&#xa0;couple of friends \u2013 obviously had a&#xa0;meat fruit. We're serving around 1,000 of them a week now!</p> <p><strong>Friday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>None at home because I&#xa0;was running late, but I had tea and breakfast canap\u00e9s at the launch of a&#xa0;new <a href=\"http://www.visionexpress.com/news/0042//\" title=\"\">Vision Express</a> shop on Oxford Street \u2013 loads of bites, so breakfast in stages.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Vision Express sushi before cutting the ribbon for the official store opening. I met another great spectacle-wearing geek, <a href=\"http://gadgetshow.channel5.com/profiles/Jason_Bradbury\" title=\"\">Jason Bradbury</a>, there from The Gadget Show, so had a lot to talk about.</p> <p><strong>Dinner </strong>Roast chicken at a friend's \u2013 it's the biggest joy when someone asks you to their home and cooks for you, but my mates always joke that it's such a stress. I think it's the other way round when they come to mine \u2013 it's not as if I can just cook up a steak. People are expecting to eat the cutlery at the very least.</p> <p><strong>Saturday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>A quick tea and pastry on the way&#xa0;to the lab \u2013 more Earl Grey.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Tasting two new dishes for the Duck. Nowhere near finished, but one will end up on the menu for Christmas as a kind of \"partridge in a pear tree\" \u2013 partridge cooked in butter at a low temperature to relax the meat, served on the breastbone with brandy butter, and chestnut and pine and mandarin (basically all the aromas and flavours we associate with Christmas). We're also looking at the leathering process from the 1800s for a turbot dish \u2013 tanning agents in early 1800s Britain were sumac, oak and mimosa bark, so we use all three. The drainage from the tanneries heated up the land, and we grew pineapples and melons on it, so we serve the fish with savoury melon and purple carrot. Oh, and frankincense and crystalised sea veg \u2013 we make our own leather from the fish skin, which you don't eat, but which will be part of the cutlery for the texture and smell. Easy, really, to balance all that?!</p> <p><strong>Dinner </strong>Working late in Bray after tasting, so had a beer and some of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/28/staff-meals-worlds-best-restaurants\" title=\"\">head chef Jonny Lake's</a> nachos with the boys after service.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>Heston's Fantastical Food starts on 6 November at 9pm on Channel 4.</p> <p></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/nigellalawson\" title=\"\"><strong>Nigella Lawson</strong></a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398955393\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/26/1351246121301/Nigella-Lawson-009.jpg\" alt=\"Nigella Lawson\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigella Lawson.

Straight after breakfast, made batch of coffee ice-cream and chocolate nougat cookies to take to curry favour with various radio and TV interviews that I have lined up for day.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>I am not good when I miss meals; being hungry makes me both murderous and suicidal. So didn't feel good that I didn't manage to get back for lunch until about 4.30pm and had to leave house for the next thingy at 5pm, so all I had time for was some rye toast with hummus and coriander on top, and a far too small portion at that.</p> <p><strong>Supper </strong>Roast chicken \u2013 I have all the bits with cartilage and skin, by choice, while pretending to make great sacrifices so that the children can eat the white meat \u2013 on escarole (my favourite lettuce) dressed just with Maldon, <a href=\"http://www.farrington-oils.co.uk/products/mellow-yellow/\" title=\"\">Mellow Yellow cold-pressed rapeseed oil</a>, lemon and lots of English mustard.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Made an egg and bacon sandwich for one of the children, but then ran too late to have breakfast myself. Not a good start to the day, made worse by the fact that I was going to a photographic shoot, which always makes me nervy.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Made up for lack of breakfast by eating huge amounts of rotisserie chicken, char-grilled corn and crinkly chips from <a href=\"http://www.chickenshop.com/\" title=\"\">Chicken Shop</a> in Kentish Town. Don't blame them for the poor display: I had a takeaway and didn't present the food (such was my quaking hunger) to its best advantage. From this point onwards, my life started looking up.</p> <p><strong>Supper </strong>By special request, made risi e bisi, a Venetian recipe (think a soupy pea risotto) that's a favourite in my home. I am always grateful when this is what I'm asked to cook, because it's quick and easy, and as comforting for the cook as the eater.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398955394\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351101106395/Food-diaries-Nigella-008.jpg\" alt=\"Food diaries Nigella\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigella Lawson: 'I am not good when I miss meals; being hungry makes me both murderous and\u00a0suicidal.'

I feel a real traitor to&#xa0;my country choosing Vegemite over Marmite, but there it is.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Since this is a day of interviews, and the meagre toast with Vegemite is wearing off to the point of panic, I order a steak and chips. True, there are only four chips on the plate (though I must tell you they were much bigger and hunkier than they look), but they've been generous with the b\u00e9arnaise sauce, and I also have a tube of <a href=\"http://www.colmans.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Colman's</a> in&#xa0;my bag, so I manage to get through the afternoon.</p> <p><strong>Supper </strong>By request, again, I make another of my children's favourites \u2013 penne with ham, peas and cream.</p> <p><strong>Thursday </strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast</strong> The usual rye toast and egg \u2013 and an awful lot of tea. In fact, I can never actually eat breakfast before I've had my two mugs of tea.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Have a meeting at home over lunch, so roast a butterflied leg of lamb, along with a tin of sliced pink fir apple potatoes, yellow courgettes, cherry tomatoes, leeks and black olives. There is no particular design to this vegetable mixture: I was just giving my fridge a bit of a going through, and bunged everything that needed to be used up into a roasting tin.</p> <p><strong>Supper </strong>Although I complied with children's wishes, making them burgers (not homemade, I must own up, but <a href=\"http://www.waitrose.com/shop/ProductView-10317-10001-134075-Heston+from+Waitrose+2+Ultimate+Beef+Burgers\" title=\"\">Heston's from Waitrose</a>) with plastic cheese, potatoes cut somewhere between wedges and chips, roasted with garlic cloves and pancetta cubes, and a rather 1970s-looking salad, I needed the simple salve of an avocado, eaten with nothing more than a spritz of lemon and a snowy throw of salt.</p> <p>I did succumb to some <a href=\"http://www.boojabooja.com/chocolate_truffles.asp\" title=\"\">Booja-Booja champagne truffles</a> later, but I never feel bad about that.</p> <p><strong>Friday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Smoked salmon, coarsely ground white pepper, lemon juice and lots of dill \u2013 for me, the best way to eat it. I am very fussy about the smoked salmon, though; it must be London-cure, which is so lusciously mild that it's more like eating wafer-thin sashimi than anything else. I&#xa0;get mine, as my grandmother did before me, from <a href=\"http://www.panzers.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Panzer's in St John's Wood</a>, despite the schlepp.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>A frantic day, and much as I&#xa0;like having proper meals and not grabbed snacks, lunch today is a&#xa0;toasted sandwich. Still, it's a very good toastie, buttery-crisp on the outside, lined with ham as thin and tender and pink as a kitten's tongue, and gooey with jarlsberg.</p> <p><strong>Supper </strong>Going to see Michael McIntyre at the O2, so supper has to be a picnic on the way there. I&#xa0;have an old picnic box I bought on eBay, and make a few batches of rice noodle and prawn salad, with beansprouts, sugar snaps and a lot of ginger, chilli and soy to go inside it. Friends we're going with a supply of champagne and, given that I can get drunk on one glass, I am reeling by the time I get home. Fantastic night, though, topped off by a buttered, toasted bagel on my return, followed by crisps and chocolate.</p> <p><strong>Saturday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Get up too late for breakfast, but manage a good lunch-after-the-night-before (and pre-opening snoop) at <a href=\"http://www.colbertchelsea.com/\" title=\"\">Colbert</a> of fried eggs with black pudding and cr\u00eapes with lemon and sugar.</p> <p><strong>Supper </strong>I live very near <a href=\"http://www.thechelseafishmonger.com/\" title=\"\">the Chelsea Fishmonger</a> and generally throw myself at Rex, the fishmonger, and get myself comfortingly overstocked for the weekend. Tonight's supper is part of this catch: halibut, juicily roasted and plonked on top of some treviso leaves, with broccoli cooked with garlic oil, anchovies, chilli and dry white vermouth. This is what I use whenever I want white wine taste, but without having to open a bottle. I know it sounds odd, but unless we're having friends over, it never occurs to me to open a&#xa0;bottle of wine.</p> <p><strong>Sunday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Up too late for breakfast, but I do manage a supersized cappuccino in bed with the papers.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Tuna tartare with capers, lemon zest, spring onions and rocket: this takes about three minutes to make and is a virtuous reward for the lazy and greedy.</p> <p><strong>Supper </strong>Ever since the children have been teenagers, the ritual of Sunday lunch has been shunted on to Sunday supper. Tonight, we're having pork belly slices \u2013 think melting meat and triumphant, bronze crackling \u2013 with soy and cumin gravy, mashed potato and broccoli. I've been experimenting with some mini versions of my cappuccino pavlova and have some bases left, as well as some coffee ice-cream from Monday, so do a housekeeping job of getting rid of the two together (that's my excuse), anointed with a sticky, gleaming drizzle of Golden Syrup which, along with Maldon and Colman's, constitute the holy trinity of&#xa0;Great British Foodstuffs.</p> <p>\u2022 Nigella Lawson's new book, Nigellissima: Instant Italian Inspiration, is published by Chatto &amp; Windus at \u00a326.

Lunch is a big variable \u2013 weekdays, if I'm writing, I'll just grab a bowl of soup or knock up a salad, but more often than not I'll be recipe testing or out tasting for the businesses I&#xa0;consult for, so don't want a proper lunch. Suppers, too, have no real pattern \u2013 I'm generally out no more than twice a week, and at home it's usually based around what's about to go off in the fridge.</p> <p><strong>Saturday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Bacon and pineapple butties \u2013 must be a Saturday!</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Friends over. Stunning bit of plaice, and probably the last time I&#xa0;do peas and lettuce this year \u2013 definitely a sunshine dish. And an emergency pud \u2013 vanilla sponge stolen from a friend with a quick plum compote and pistachios.</p> <p><strong>Dinner </strong>My sister and her kids came round for supper, so we had the first big beefy braise of the winter.</p> <p><strong>Sunday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Some days I have eggs, others muesli.

Basically any leftovers I had in the fridge.</p> <p><strong>Monday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Had the plaice bones from Saturday in the fridge, so put on a&#xa0;fish stock while eating my muesli.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>A cheese straw Parthenon set the tone on the first day of cooking for the new book. Didn't have a&#xa0;sit-down lunch because of that: shared a PPP \u2013 potato pesto pizza \u2013 with the girls for lunch, then more baking with raspberry jam tarts. Had a&#xa0;proper madeleine moment when I ate one later \u2013 hadn't had a&#xa0;jam tart for years and I&#xa0;came over a bit emotional.

  "<p>One of the functions of fiction is to serve as a kind of tourism, either showing us places, situations and people that we might not otherwise reach or scrolling through snapshots of events or sensations that we remember. Crime stories rarely serve the latter purpose \u2013 most admirers of homicide novels will, thankfully, never become or even know a murder victim \u2013 but are a perfect illustration of the former.</p> <p>Throughout its history, crime literature has operated as a sort of imaginative travel agency, taking customers across borders and introducing them to unknown cultures. The story commonly considered the birth of the whodunit \u2013 <a href=\"http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/eapoe/bl-eapoe-murders.htm\" title=\"\">Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" (1841)</a> \u2013 was written by an American and set in Paris. Since then, the genre has regularly been a ticket for a Grand Tour.</p> <p>Agatha Christie, an enthusiastic globe-trotter through her wealth and marriage to an archaeologist, sent <a href=\"http://www.poirot.us/poirot.php\" title=\"\">Hercule Poirot </a>on the Orient Express, Nile cruises and aeroplane journeys, depicting trips that the majority of her audience was unlikely ever to experience for real. Later in the 20th century, readers, listeners and viewers of detective tales learned about France from <a href=\"http://www.trussel.com/f_maig.htm\" title=\"\">Simenon's Maigret </a>and the Netherlands through <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/jul/22/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\" title=\"\">Nicolas Freeling's Commissaris Van der Valk</a>, who achieved the rare double of topping both the TV ratings lists (in the ITV series starring Barry Foster) and the pop charts, with the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_ZSaxF63Gs\" title=\"\">Simon Park Orchestra's recording of the theme tune, \"Eye Level\"</a>.</p> <p>And, these days, Britons have a greater understanding of Scandinavian culture than ever before: not from exports such as Abba, Bjorn Borg, Volvo or Ikea, but through what was \u2013 at least until the recent apothesois of sado-masochistic soft porn \u2013 the biggest publishing phenomenon of the 21st century: the super-selling mystery stories of writers from Sweden (Stieg Larsson, Henning Mankell) and Norway (Jo Nesb\u00f8).</p> <p>Retracing these journeys, I have made a 15-part series for BBC Radio 4, <em>Foreign Bodies</em>, which uses celebrated fictional detectives \u2013 from Christie's Poirot to <a href=\"http://www.jonesbo.co.uk/meetharryhole.asp\" title=\"\">Nesb\u00f8's Harry Hole</a> \u2013 to explore the history of modern Europe. Cop novels are a useful tool for such a survey because the police procedural turns on detail. Novelists working in crime-free narratives have no need (and often no wish) to specify a character's job, clothes, income or family background. But because observation and evidence are crucial to the investigation of a crime \u2013 the motive for which will often rest on who someone was or what they possessed or desired \u2013 crime writers routinely provide a mass of social detail: menus, train timetables, fashion labels, shops, newspaper stories. As a result, good crime novels become a case-file of their times. The introduction of the welfare system and unemployment benefit, for example, can be traced through the comments of posh employers in Christie's mysteries. And reporters preparing to cover the impending referendum on Scottish independence would be well advised to read <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/jun/06/rebus-back-reveals-ian-rankin\" title=\"\">Ian Rankin's DCI Rebus</a> books, which systematically depict the country's re-examination of its identity over the last 25 years, with one book \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/crime/9780752883632/set-in-darkness\" title=\"\"><em>Set in Darkness </em>(2000)</a> \u2013 even involving the discovery of a corpse in the foundations of the Scottish parliament building.</p> <p>In the same way, future historians considering why Sweden holds the improbable distinction of being the only western democracy to have both its prime minister and foreign minister assassinated in modern times \u2013 or why a racist gunman killed 77 people in Norway in 2011 \u2013 will find clues to the forces behind those events in crime novels written at least a decade earlier.</p> <p>Crime fiction is a magnifying glass that frequently reveals the fingerprints of history before they become visible to politicans or journalists. And \u2013 as in a forensic investigation \u2013 separate pieces of evidence can begin to reveal patterns.</p> <p>On <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/crimewatch/\" title=\"\"><em>Crimewatch UK</em></a>, during the update section just after the news in which the detectives discuss calls that have come in from the public, lead investigators will often comment, with a note of satisfaction, that \"certain names have come up several times already\". Weight of recognition, cross-referencing of mentions, is frequently a crucial clue in detection. And, in a more benevolent sense, it was striking how, while following the trail of crime novels written from before the second world war to the present day, the same names \u2013 of influential authors and characters \u2013 kept cropping up.</p> <p>As keen readers in the field might guess, the undisputed godfathers of the genre remain Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) and Sherlock Holmes, who lived in print from 1887 to 1923, although he carries on immortally in all entertainment forms. So long and so strong is the shadow of Holmes that anyone subsequently creating a detective in any culture has had to make a deliberate gesture of homage or avoidance to the resident of 221B Baker Street.</p> <p>For example, it is my strong suspicion that the reason Hercule Poirot (print-dates 1920-75) is Belgian is that, if Christie (1890-1976) had made him English, the detective's characteristics \u2013 intuitive, aloof, fastidious about couture and cuisine \u2013 would have made him too transparently a Holmes clone. The most dramatised detective after Holmes and Poirot, Commissaire Jules Maigret (1931-72), is again distanced from the template by his Parisian location, but he too has certain Holmesian aspects (hyper-intelligence, a pipe) that feel like deliberate nods from his creator, the officially Belgian but temperamentally French Georges Simenon (1903-89).</p> <p>With remarkable consistency across generations and nations, Holmes is the genre's homepage. The tendency of fictional detectives to be more cerebral and sensitive than their real-life counterparts \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2011/nov/04/pd-james-life-in-writing\" title=\"\">PD James'</a>s Adam Dalgliesh writes poetry, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15239392\" title=\"\">Ruth Rendell's Reg Wexford</a> was a probably rare Guardian-reading liberal in the 1960s force \u2013 follows Conan Doyle's model of the reflective detective, as does the latest top British cop:<a href=\"http://www.peterjames.com/books\" title=\"\"> Peter James's thoughtful, haunted DCI Roy Grace</a>.</p> <p>The Czechoslovakian writer Josef \u0160kvoreck\u00fd (1924-2012) created, in Inspector Boruvka of the Prague Homicide Bureau, a policeman profoundly indebted to Holmes in both hyper-intelligent rationalisation of crimes and near-clinical melancholy. And the newest super-sleuth in publishing \u2013 Nesb\u00f8's Norwegian private eye, Harry Hole \u2013 also allusively combines addiction with an almost supernatural ability to see into the minds of criminals.</p> <p>So pervasive is the post-Holmes type that only significant distinctions of background or gender can avoid the influence. Rankin's impulsive, earthy, working-class Scottish DCI Rebus seems deliberately to depart from the looming English examples. And <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/interview--dci-jane-tennison-yes-that-was-me-prime-suspect-was-far-more-than-mere-tv-for-jackie-malton-on-whose-rebellious-career-helen-mirrens-detective-was-based-1491767.html\" title=\"\">Lynda La Plante's DCI Jane Tennison</a>, who solved seven murder cases on television between 1991 and 2006, was almost as revolutionary as Sherlock in offering an alternative female model, which has been continued and extended in print by writers including Val McDermid and Denise Mina. However, because Conan Doyle is to some extent an invisible author \u2013 most of the Holmes stories employ the voice of Dr Watson and take the form of his report on the case \u2013 he is not the author with most influence on prose tone and structure. In that respect, my inquiries revealed, the biggest influence in European crime fiction is Simenon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398921185\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/10/25/1351182813735/Inspector-Montalbano-008.jpg\" alt=\"Inspector Montalbano\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrea Camilleri's Inspector Montalbano (played by Luca Zingaretti in the TV series) questions what it means to be a good policeman.

In Berlin, one of the leading German crime-writers, Jakob Arjouni, also kept a complete Simenon close to his desk. PD James cites Simenon as a master as well, confirming a literary afterlife that perhaps validates the view of Andr\u00e9 Gide that the Belgian writer should have won the Nobel prize for literature.</p> <p>This strong sense of tradition and succession in crime fiction was underlined by the almost universal tendency of leading crime novelists to acknowledge predecessors as inspirations. For example, Mankell admitted that his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/jul/23/wallander-cant-get-enough\" title=\"\">Kurt Wallander</a> \u2013 a melancholy Swedish policeman whose cases expose changes in Scandinavian society \u2013 could never have existed without the example of Martin Beck, a depressive, historically sensitive cop who featured in the novels of a married couple of former journalists, Maj Sj\u00f6wall and Per Wahl\u00f6\u00f6, whose 10 Beck books published between 1965 and 1975 are being dramatised by Radio 4 as part of this exploration of European crime fiction. Nesb\u00f8 argues that Beck is the source of the now dominant wave of Scandinavian crime stories: a Nordic Holmes.</p> <p>In describing the main remit of my inquiry as postwar crime fiction, I meant the second world war. And the conflict of 1939-45 has an understandably large presence in books written from the differing perspectives of Britain, France, Holland, Germany and Italy. More surprising, though, was the dawning realisation that even books set beyond the reach of that period seemed to have a significant relation with some other military standoff, as if postwar wounds were a natural driving force of the murder novel.</p> <p>The Vietnam war stalks the Martin Beck sequence: his creators met at a protest march against US involvement in south-east Asia. There are long echoes of that radicalising issue in Nesb\u00f8's novels as well. Meanwhile, through his books about the best man in the Prague Homicide Bureau, \u0160kvoreck\u00fd animates two key eastern European experiences of the cold war: occupation and exile. <em>The Mournful Demeanour of Lieutenant Boruvka</em>, written in 1966 in Prague under censorship from the Russian-backed puppet government, can only express dissidence through code and nudges. But, after the author gained asylum in Canada following the Soviet invasion of 1968, <em>The End of Lieutenant Boruvka</em> (1975) and <em>The Return of Lieutenant Boruvka</em> (1980) provide a compelling account of the moral horror and bureaucratic comedy of life under communism.</p> <p>In a similar way, <a href=\"http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/a/jakob-arjouni/\" title=\"\">Arjouni's</a> character of Kemal Kayankaya \u2013 a private eye born in Germany to a Turkish immigrant family \u2013 explores the consequences for Europe of the collapse of the Soviet empire, the wars in the former Yugoslavia and the reunification of Germany. From <em>Happy Birthday, Turk!</em> (1980) to <em>Brother Kemal</em> (to be published in English in 2013), in which Kayankaya is hired to protect a writer who has offended Islamist groups, Arjouni uses crimes to explore issues \u2013 of immigration, nationalism and religious sensitivity \u2013 that dominate contemporary European politics.</p> <p>In the work of Spain's foremost author in the form \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/oct/21/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries1\" title=\"\">Manuel V\u00e1zquez Montalb\u00e1n</a> (1939-2003) \u2013 the conflict that underlies the writing is the Spanish civil war, or, at least, the dictatorship of General Franco that followed and the subsequent transition to a constitutional monarchy, with King Juan Carlos I as a rare example of a monarch as a post-revolutionary figure. Montalb\u00e1n (after whom Camilleri's Inspector Montalbano is named in homage) employs his Barcelona private eye, Pepe Carvalho, to interrogate this complex political situation. Montalb\u00e1n's work is an exemplar of how crime novels can be used to analyse shifts in society: <em>An Olympic Death</em>, published just after the 1992 Barcelona games, makes fascinating reading in a London also struggling with the cost and legacy of hosting the event.</p> <p>Inevitably, though, it is scar tissue from the great global battles of the 20th century that runs through European crime fiction. Both Maigret and Poirot are war veterans: David Suchet laments that the limp from the Belgian's wound is the only characteristic he has failed to incorporate in his ITV portrayal. In the Van der Valk stories, on both page and screen, it was common for the solution to lie in whether victims or suspects had been collaborators or resistance fighters during the Nazi occupation of Holland.</p> <p>And, even though Nesb\u00f8 was not born until 1960, his books fascinatingly illuminate a specifically Scandinavian experience of the second world war. This is partly because of the writer's own personal legacy \u2013 his mother was in the resistance, while his father was among the Norwegians who fought with the Germans \u2013 but also because Norway has a literal inheritance from the period. As Scandinavians embodied the physical ideal of Nazi eugenicists, citizens were enlisted, during the occupation, in a breeding programme involving German officers, whose descendants remain in the population today. This dark history is threaded through the Harry Hole novels, particularly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/crime/9780099546764/the-devils-star\" title=\"\"><em>The Devil's Star</em></a> (2005). In retrospect, we can see that the books also chart the rise of modern Norwegian neo-Nazism, a psychopathic disciple of which, Anders Behring Breivik, murdered 77 people in Oslo and on Ut\u00f8ya island last year. While journalism explored these tensions after the event, Scandinavian crime fiction \u2013 as the genre often does \u2013 sensed the undercurrents before the massacre happened.</p> <p>Admittedly, there is one large and frustrating gap in the form's record of the causes and consequences of the second world war. Bernhard Schlink, who wrote a number of detective novels in the 1980s before becoming better known for literary fiction such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780297859321/the-reader\" title=\"\"><em>The Reader</em></a>, acknowledges that for decades German authors were reluctant to engage with their nation's past. My suspicion is that mystery stories were a particular victim of this self-censorship because the classic structure of the murder puzzle \u2013 in which the guilt of the past is exposed and secrets are revealed - was always likely to lead, in Germany, to the villains of the Hitler era. The continuing sensitivity of the subject was shown this year when Ferdinand von Schirach \u2013 whose grandfather was head of the Hitler Youth \u2013 achieved a bestseller but also triggered controversy with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/sep/21/thrillers-roundup-reviews\" title=\"\"><em>The Collini Case</em></a>, a legal thriller that deals with the continuing taboo of the infiltration of the postwar German political and judicial systems by former Nazis.</p> <p>Because of the belated and apprehensive literary response to the war in the defeated aggressor, the greatest German-language crime stories of the 20th century were written by a non-German. <a href=\"http://www.portwashington.com/moveweb/Guidewrite/durrenmatt.html\" title=\"\">Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt</a> (1921-90) was a Swiss polymath who worked as a playwright (<em>The Visit</em>, <em>The Physicists</em>), artist and essayist, but also wrote brilliant cop novels that explore the postwar guilt of Germany and Switzerland, whose official stance of political neutrality D\u00fcrrenmatt regarded as a lie.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398921186\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/10/25/1351183056513/The-Pledge-008.jpg\" alt=\"The Pledge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Nicholson as the compromised cop in <em>The Pledge</em>.

It is in the work of D\u00fcrrenmatt that the crime story most fulfils its potential as an instrument for moral exploration. In <em>The Pledge</em> (1958), provocatively subtitled \"Requiem for the Detective Novel\", a retired homicide detective shockingly uses a young girl as bait in the hope of catching a sex-killer who has eluded him. In an Americanised but still properly disturbing version, <em>The Pledge</em> was impresssively filmed by Sean Penn in 2001, with Jack Nicholson as the compromised cop.</p> <p>During months of interviews, one comment affected my thinking about the genre more than any other. The Spanish writer <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-summer-of-dead-toys-by-antonio-hill-7858672.html\" title=\"\">Antonio Hill </a>\u2013 who has just started a Barcelona-based series with <em>The Summer of Dead Toys</em> \u2013 told me that, on a recent trip to Mexico, his hosts had expressed astonishment at his profession. \"Why the hell,\" they asked, \"would you want to write books about policemen?\" Mexicans could not envisage a cop as a hero.</p> <p>The implication of this anecdote \u2013 that crime fiction depends on readers' respect for the investigator \u2013 poses a challenge to mainstream British crime fiction, in which there is an overwhelming assumption that justice will ultimately be done. With very rare exceptions \u2013 in one of PD James's novels, Dalgliesh is forced to accept that the real villain has evaded blame \u2013 the crime is correctly and satisfyingly solved. And yet, from the Birmingham Six to Hillsborough, via recent allegations of police complicity with tabloid journalists and earlier failures to investigate the paedophilia of Jimmy Savile, there are frequent worrying suggestions that the British police have been less reliably straight than their counterparts in fiction.</p> <p>Mexicans sceptical about this kind of literature, though, should note Italian crime fiction, which pointedly accommodates ambiguity about the possibility of resolution and the role of the investigator. Leonardo Sciascia (1921-89), identified as a past master by contemporary authors almost as often as Simenon, openly showed an Italian society in which the power of the Mafia is so great that the judicial system judges it unwise to identify the true culprits. In <em>Equal Danger</em> (1971), Inspector Rogas, a rural 'tec looking into murders in the legal profession, soon realises that his police and political bosses do not want him to uncover the truth. That novel, and <em>The Day of the Owl</em> (1961), were landmark books in making Cosa Nostra a legitimate subject for fiction.</p> <p>Andrea Camilleri \u2013 who, like Sciascia, comes from the Mafia heartland of Sicily \u2013 has continued his predecessor's project of dramatising the overlap between the political and gangster establishments. Inspector Montalbano directly addresses, in anguished inner monologue, the question of what it means to be a good policeman in a culture where it can be unwelcome \u2013 or even dangerous \u2013 to crack a case. The fine British writer <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/apr/04/culture.obituaries\" title=\"\">Michael Dibdin </a>(1947-2007), in his 11 books about the Venetian-born Inspector Zen, borrowed from Sciascia a very non-English scepticism about the good faith of police operations.</p> <p>The pressure to ignore the real perpetrator, or to pin the crime on a false suspect, is even greater for characters who serve as police officers in a police state. The Russian writer Boris Akunin addresses this dilemma \u2013 albeit through the distancing device of historical parallel \u2013 in his series about a 19th-century police officer, Erast Fandorin. But it was \u0160kvoreck\u00fd who, from his North American exile, most eloquently expressed the dilemma of the investigator encouraged to turn a blind eye. Inspector Boruvka's problem in Soviet-controlled Czechoslovakia, he wrote, was that \"the whole country was a crime scene\" in which mass murders were regularly carried out by the government. From his reading of Conan Doyle and others, \u0160kvoreck\u00fd understood that the classic homicide puzzle depends on violent death being an exceptional event. That is why the English genre \u2013 from Christie to James and Rendell \u2013 has often involved bodies being stumbled on in rural communities, guaranteeing a dissonance between order and disorder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398921187\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/10/25/1351183485871/Shadow-Dancer-008.jpg\" alt=\"Shadow Dancer\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Bradby's <em>Shadow Dancer</em> with (left to right) Domhnall Gleeson, Andrea Riseborough and Brid Brennan.

Only now, after years of ceasefire and peace process, is Northern Irish crime fiction flourishing through such writers as <a href=\"http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article/3473/stuart-neville-from-armagh-to-la\" title=\"\">Stuart Neville</a> and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/9440801/Tom-Bradby-how-I-brought-Shadow-Dancer-to-the-screen.html\" title=\"\">Tom Bradby</a>. Jason Webster points out that Spain's equivalent of the IRA, the Basque separatist terrorists ETA, who agreed a ceasefire only very recently, has yet to make a significant appearance in Spanish crime fiction. The cop novel seems to require chaos recollected from relative stability.</p> <p>It's notable, though, that even in settings where a redemptive ending is unlikely, the central investigator is invariably on the side of right. However pressured or frightened Boruvka, Rogas, Montalbano or Zen may be, they at least attempt to do the right thing. Even at its most sophisticated, the genre seems to reflect a belief that order will be restored.</p> <p>Among Sherlock Holmes's many profound influences on the genre is his status as a dire warning to authors of the risks of killing off a sleuth beloved by the public. Conan Doyle's medically unrealistic and narratively ridiculous resurrection of Holmes after killing him at the Reichenbach Falls has become a cautionary tale for crime novelists in much the way that makers of popular television are haunted by two notorious series-weakening links that also, curiously, involved water: Bobby Ewing coming out of the shower alive a year after dying in <em>Dallas</em> (his wife had dreamed his death!) and the Fonz raising his surfboard over a killer fish in <em>Happy Days</em>, leading to \"jumping the shark\" becoming the expression for a show that jettisons credibility.</p> <p>True to his cussed literary sensitivity, Nicolas Freeling believed that he could jump the Reichenbach Falls. In <em>A Long Silence</em> (1972), Van der Valk goes for an evening stroll on a rainy Dutch street and is killed in a hit-and-run related to the case he is working on. A shocking passage even when read in the knowledge of its outcome, it is one of Freeling's best pieces of writing (the critic Grey Gowrie describes Freeling as one of the finest writers of atmospheric weather) but it had a calamitous effect on his career. His readership, like the crazed fan in Stephen King's <em>Misery</em>, rebelled and refused to warm to his replacement franchise: a series featuring a French investigator, Henri Castang. In an emergency manoeuvre, Freeling was persuaded to turn to his dead detective's widow, Arlette, as a central character in a new Van der Valk series, but the audience would not be appeased.</p> <p>Conan Doyle and Freeling have the effect of a siren blaring in the head of any crime writer who, bored with a hero, considers sending them to Switzerland either literally (the Reichenbach Falls) or metaphorically, now that Zurich is code for euthanasia. Although, strangely enough, it is a Swiss detective who dies most decisively and irretrievably: almost the first thing we learn about Inspector Barlach of the Bern Police is that he has terminal cancer, which is why there are only two books about him. Killing a cerebral investigator in a Swiss canton may be another of D\u00fcrrenmatt's dark jokes.</p> <p>In the modern publishing world, with marketing managers craving a new title in a bestselling series every Christmas for as many years as possible, authors have to make a formal decision about the longevity of their cops. PD James told me that she could not bear to kill off Dalgliesh, because it would feel like writing her own death, although she declared the end of the series with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/crime/9780571242443/the-private-patient\" title=\"\"><em>The Private Patient</em></a> (2006). That same year, Rankin retired DCI John Rebus, but has brought him back to investigate a cold case (in line with realistic police procedure) in this autumn's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/crime/9781409144717/standing-in-another-mans-grave\" title=\"\"><em>Standing in Another Man's Grave</em></a>, having admitted to missing him. Mankell gave Wallander Alzheimer's disease in a book published three years ago, which means the detective could theoretically return but not practically, thereby reducing Mankell's risk of suffering the misery of having his ankles broken by a furious enthusiast holding him hostage in a snowy cabin. Camilleri told me that a final Montalbano novel was written out of sequence and locked in a safe at his publishers (as Christie did with the Poirot coda, <em>Curtain</em>). Miming a waterfall with his hands, he joked that he has made it impossible for his detective to be resurrected.</p> <p>At the Crime Writing Festival in Harrogate this year, Jo Nesb\u00f8, currently the world's bestselling crime writer, admitted that he knows exactly how many Harry Hole novels there will be. The front row, containing staff from his publisher, leaned forward nervously, but Nesb\u00f8 refused to disclose the number. A keen crime-reader I know believes that it will be 10: the number of career cases investigated by the godfather of Scandinavian detective fiction, Martin Beck, and the number of books to which Stieg Larsson intended his Millennium sequence to stretch until his early death confined Lisbeth Salander to a trilogy.</p> <p>Another Stockholm phenomenon \u2013 the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel prize for literature \u2013 ignored Gide's suggestion that the honour should go to Simenon. And such is the continuing snobbery against the genre that the Belgian's employment of crime fiction may have been held against him, as it may also have hobbled D\u00fcrrenmatt and \u0160kvoreck\u00fd, equally worthy candidates for the range of their writing. But, though sniffed at by literary history, crime writing, from Christie to Nesb\u00f8, has an enviable record of capturing the history of our times.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Foreign Bodies</em> runs on weekdays until 2 November at 1.45pm on BBC Radio 4. <em>The Martin Beck Killings</em> begins on 27 October at 2.30pm on BBC Radio 4.</p>",
  "<p>Vivienne Michel is perhaps the least well-known of the women for whom Ian Fleming arranged assignations with James Bond, and yet none of her more celebrated sisters, from <a href=\"http://jamesbond.wikia.com/wiki/Vesper_Lynd\" title=\"\">Vesper Lynd</a> through <a href=\"http://jamesbond.wikia.com/wiki/Tatiana_Romanova\" title=\"\">Tatiana Romanova</a> and <a href=\"http://jamesbond.wikia.com/wiki/Pussy_Galore\" title=\"\">Pussy Galore</a> to the <a href=\"http://jamesbond.wikia.com/wiki/Tracy_Bond\" title=\"\">Countess Teresa di Vicenzo</a>, succeeded in engaging the author's interest to the same extent. To her alone is accorded the honour of a Bond book written entirely in her voice, with 007 making a late appearance in a supporting role. And although, unlike some of the others, she survived to tell the tale, she was destined to suffer a different kind of literary death.</p> <p>Few novelists in Fleming's position, riding the public's voracious appetite for the adventures of a fictional hero, would opt for the sort of risk that he took with <em>The Spy Who Loved Me</em> in 1962. By the time he came to write the ninth of his Bond books, the already massive popularity of his creation was about to be transformed, by the release of the film of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/85424/dr-no\" title=\"\"><em>Dr No</em></a>, into a cultural phenomenon. Yet his health was starting to collapse, along with his interest in maintaining the formula established with the publication of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/thrillers/9780141187587/casino-royale\" title=\"\"><em>Casino Royale</em></a>, Bond's debut, nine years earlier. His response to an inner urge for novelty, and perhaps a desire for a more elevated kind of acclaim, was to employ an entirely different voice and to hold back the appearance of his celebrated protagonist until after the halfway point of the story.</p> <p>Although in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/thrillers/9780141045009/from-russia-with-love\" title=\"\"><em>From Russia, With Love</em></a>, five years earlier, he had filled the opening 77 pages with Rosa Klebb, Donovan Grant and Tatiana Romanova before bringing Bond on to the stage, there was never any doubt about the identity of the central character, and the device was a success. In the case of <em>The Spy Who Loved Me</em>, however, delay was not answered by gratification, and Fleming's gamble ended with his readers and reviewers feeling betrayed by the sudden change of tack and tone. \"His ability to invent a plot has deserted him almost entirely,\" the Glasgow Herald's critic harrumphed, \"and he has had to substitute for a fast-moving story the sorry misadventures of an upper-class tramp, told in dreary detail.\" A chastened Fleming wrote to Michael Howard, his publisher at Jonathan Cape, to insist that plans for a paperback edition should be abandoned; today's authors and publishers might be surprised to learn that his desire was honoured, at least until after his death two years later.</p> <p>Wisely, the current paperback edition omits the coy prologue written by Fleming for the original publication, a memo to the reader in which he claimed that the manuscript of <em>The Spy Who Loved Me</em> had simply materialised on his desk one day, along with a note from one \"Vivienne Michel\", asserting authorship of this narrative of what she claimed to have been a real incident. \"I was interested in this view of James Bond, through the wrong end of a telescope, so to speak,\" Fleming wrote, \"and after obtaining clearance for certain minor infringements of the Official Secrets Act I have much pleasure in sponsoring its publication.\"</p> <p>His narrator recounts her childhood in Canada, her education and early working life in England and her decision, at the age of 23, to return to North America and embark on a road trip from Quebec to Florida. In the Adirondacks, short of money, she accepts an offer of $60 to spend a night looking after an empty motel that is about to be closed for the winter. Two thugs arrive from New York (via Central Casting: their names are Sluggsy and Horror), apparently working for the owner. They are about to have their way with her in preparation for burning the place down in an insurance fire and leaving her corpse to take the blame, when Bond appears out of the stormy night, having suffered a puncture on the way from Nassau, and the conclusion of Operation Thunderball, to Toronto, where he has been assigned to protect a Russian defector. Thereafter Fleming gives us the standard mayhem in which Bond routs the hoodlums before sleeping with the girl in a scene that finds the author using his female narrator to express a view for which he has been roundly and regularly condemned: \"All women love semi-rape. They love to be taken. It was his sweet brutality against my bruised body that had made his act of love so piercingly wonderful.\"</p> <p>Fleming, a confirmed fan of sadism in his own relationship, certainly meant it. In <em>Casino Royale</em> he had Bond musing in similar terms on the prospect of sex with Vesper Lynd: \"And now he knew that \u2026 the conquest of her body, because of the central privacy in her, would have the sweet tang of rape.\" Which makes it more than a little surprising that the most interesting and convincing section of the book, and the one adding weight to the contention that Fleming could actually write, is the one in which Vivienne Michel introduces herself and describes the circumstances of her life up the point at which it is disrupted by Sluggsy and Horror.</p> <p>Like Jay McInerney, who followed the fashionable success of <em>Bright Lights, Big City</em> in the mid-80s with the poorly received <em>Story of My Life</em>, written in the voice of a 20-year-old New York party girl, Fleming attempts to locate the vocabulary and formulations that his narrator would use in writing a diary or talking into a recording device: something quite different from his usual prose. But whereas McInerney produced a cokehead's stream of heightened (or debased) consciousness, Fleming summons the voice of an intelligent middle-class young woman of the 1950s. Clearly drawing extensively on the experiences of female acquaintances in his active private life and in his professional capacity as the well-connected foreign manager of the Sunday Times, he allows Michel to tell her story in her own way, complete with the occasional girlish exclamation mark.</p> <p>Orphaned at an early age, she is brought up by an aunt who sends her, at the age of 16, to England to be \"finished\" at the sort of Home Counties establishment \u2013 still to be found in the 1960s but presumably now extinct \u2013 where flower arranging and cordon bleu cookery led the curriculum. For her season as a debutante she moves to London, shares a flat off Kings Road and finds her way into the Chelsea scene. Soon she is losing her virginity rather messily to an Oxford undergraduate called Derek; there is a vividly evoked scene, apparently drawn from Fleming's memory of his own defloration, of their discovery in flagrante by a flashlight-wielding cinema manager.</p> <p>Discarded by Derek, she gets a job on a local paper and, having learnt to spot and sell a story, is inspired by a cast of real-life Fleet Street figures: \"My gods, or rather goddesses (Katharine Whitehorn and Penelope Gilliatt were outside my orbit), were Drusilla Beyfus, Veronica Papworth, Jean Campbell, Shirley Lord, Barbara Griggs and Anne Sharpley.\" She joins the London staff of a foreign news agency run by a German who gets her pregnant and sends her to Zurich for an abortion, while giving her a month's pay in lieu of notice. Her sense of bewilderment and humiliation during these various ordeals is drawn with surprising empathy, accurately reflecting the prevailing mood and mores of the pre-feminist times.</p> <p>Fleming was in his early 50s and his health was already causing concern when he wrote <em>The Spy Who Loved Me</em> during his customary yearly stay at Goldeneye, his home on the north coast of Jamaica. That Christmas he had been no longer fit enough to ski on a family holiday in St Moritz. His relationship with his wife Ann, the former Lady Rothermere, was in difficulties, provoked in part by their unconcealed infidelities but also by the tendency of Ann's circle of literary friends, who included Evelyn Waugh, to look down on a mere writer of spy thrillers, their disdain almost certainly exacerbated by his commercial success.</p> <p>There was an added anxiety when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/thrillers/9780099576952/thunderball\" title=\"\"><em>Thunderball</em></a>, in which he resisted a strong urge to kill off Bond once and for all, was published in March 1961, despite a protracted and strenuous attempt by Kevin McClory, an Irish film producer with whom he had initially worked on the story, to secure an injunction. A fortnight after the book's appearance Fleming suffered a coronary during a Sunday Times editorial conference and spent a month in the London Clinic. During his convalescence, a deal with Eon Films was completed, giving him $100,000 per film and a 5% share of the producers' profits, starting with <em>Dr No</em>. Then he travelled to Goldeneye, where, ignoring his doctor's strict instruction to cut his consumption of alcohol and cigarettes, he set to work on <em>The Spy Who Loved Me</em>.</p> <p>The manuscript was revised, and its US sequences checked by an American librarian who had written during the summer of 1961 to point out errors in the transatlantic chapters of <em>Thunderball</em>. The cover art was prepared in the usual trompe l'oeil style of the Bond hardbacks by the artist Richard Chopping, whose fee of 250 guineas bust Cape's 25-guinea budget and was made up by the author himself. Meanwhile <em>Thunderball</em> was proving to be a massive success, hugely boosted in the US by a Life magazine story in which the young president John F Kennedy numbered the creator of James Bond among his favourite authors.</p> <p>Perhaps Fleming hoped to use <em>The Spy Who Loved Me</em> to demonstrate that he could broaden his literary range. For all the artlessness of Vivienne Michel's voice, he kept hold of his ability to flood his story with beguiling incidental detail, tinged with his usual amused scorn for American habits. Here he goes easy on the brand names so beloved of Bond, the mention of Michel's 150cc Vespa Gran Sport scooter and her Ferragamo sandals being among relatively few exceptions. More important, this most easily and frequently parodied of authors also displays his seldom noted feeling for the cadence of sentences and paragraphs, something that emerges in all his books amid the passages of mechanical clunkiness, and which has steadfastly eluded the army of novelists, including Kingsley Amis, Sebastian Faulks and most recently Jeffery Deaver, attempting what are known as \"continuation\" volumes.</p> <p>\"I was running away,\" Michel's narrative starts. \"I was running away from England, from my childhood, from the winter, from a sequence of untidy, unattractive love-affairs, from the few sticks of furniture and jumble of overworn clothes that my London life had collected around me; and I was running away from drabness, fustiness, snobbery, the claustrophobia of close horizons and from my inability, although I am quite an attractive rat, to make headway in the rat-race. In fact, I was running away from almost everything, except the law.\"</p> <p>Not a bad opening, in anyone's language, and there is more, including an amusing digression a few pages later concerning her vehement dislike of pine forests: surely Fleming's own, since the Bond books thrive on his own prejudices and discoveries. This is the Fleming capable of phrases that could lodge themselves in the memory for life, such as his description of the platform of Istanbul's Sirkeci station, as Bond prepares to board the Orient Express in <em>From Russia With Love</em>, \"throbbing with the tragic poetry of departure\".</p> <p>The lengthy denouement of <em>The Spy Who Loved Me</em> is clumsy and clich\u00e9d, as if telling Michel's backstory had exhausted Fleming's interest, but the book remains a worthwhile curiosity whose poor reception must have pained its author. The failure also forced him back into a more familiar mode. A year later Bond was present on the very first page of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/thrillers/9780099576976/on-her-majestys-secret-service\" title=\"\"><em>On Her Majesty's Secret Service</em></a>, in one of Fleming's most effective opening sequences, set on the beach at Royale-les-Eaux, the invented Picardy resort where readers had first encountered him in <em>Casino Royale</em>. The experiment was over. And when, 15 years later, they came to make a film of <em>The Spy Who Loved Me</em>, the only thing they kept was the title.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Skyfall</em> is on general release.</p>",
  "<p>A Russian woman who visited East Germany in 1986 on a Soviet school trip described to me recently how their East German official hosts explained the Berlin wall as a necessary defence against the hordes of West Germans who wished to storm into East Germany to escape West German economic misery and join in East Germany's success. And she and her 13-year-old Soviet friends had at the time no reason to doubt this, never in their lives having been told anything different. The eventual complete collapse of communism in eastern Europe has naturally tended to focus subsequent attention on its shambolic and incompetent aspects; but its effectiveness as a system of thought control should not be underestimated.</p> <p>Today, no one under 23 was even alive while communist rule in eastern Europe still existed. No one under 30 or so has any meaningful memories of it. The internet has made complete censorship of the old kind unimaginable to younger people today. As the four decades of the cold war fade into history and mythology, it is important to go on reminding people of the nature of communism in eastern Europe, and why West Germans and other Europeans were not, in fact, desperate to exchange the austere rigours of western capitalist democracy for the fleshpots and freedoms of communist rule.</p> <p>In <em>Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe 1944-56</em>, <a href=\"http://www.anneapplebaum.com/\" title=\"\">Anne Applebaum</a> does an excellent job of explaining this for the Stalinist and immediate post-Stalinist period in Poland, East Germany and Hungary. Her book is a masterly synthesis in English of recent research by scholars in these countries, and of the range of memoirs by participants and survivors.</p> <p>Applebaum's book has a political as well as a scholarly purpose, though on this occasion her political agenda does not detract significantly from her scholarship. As a rightwing cold warrior and director of political studies at the neoconservative Legatum Institute, she is clearly anxious to drive another nail into the coffin of the old European and American left, with their residual tendency to find excuses for Soviet communism.</p> <p>Thus her book begins with a strong argument against the revisionist belief that the Soviet imposition of communism in eastern Europe after 1945 was a response to hostile US moves at the start of the cold war, rather than a result of communist revolutionary ideology. She agrees that \"there is no evidence that Stalin expected to create a communist 'bloc' very quickly\", but on the other hand \"the Soviet Union did import certain key elements of the Soviet system into every nation occupied by the Red Army, from the very beginning\" \u2013 starting with the creation by the<a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RUSnkvd.htm\" title=\"\"> NKVD</a> of local communist secret police forces.</p> <p>Here I tend to agree with Applebaum \u2013 though since she addresses this question directly only in her introduction, she does not have the space to rebut the revisionist arguments in detail, or to take account of issues such as the effect on Soviet thinking of the complete end to US aid to the Soviet Union as soon as the war ended, at a time when the USSR was coping with colossal wartime destruction and impending famine.</p> <p>She is right that the template for a communist takeover was already well established since the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4517683.stm\" title=\"\">Soviet occupation of the Baltic states in 1940</a>, and most of Moscow's own local communist allies clearly expected full Soviet support for their seizure of power. As Applebaum brings out, many also genuinely believed for a time that they would receive enough mass support to win national elections.</p> <p>As far as Poland was concerned, it was evident from the entry of Soviet troops into Polish territory in the summer of 1944 that Stalin was not going to permit the creation of an independent Polish government that would demand Soviet withdrawal from the eastern territories seized from Poland under the <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/230972/German-Soviet-Nonaggression-Pact\" title=\"\">Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of&#xa0;1939</a>.</p> <p>Most of Applebaum's book, however, is not about the reasons for the communist takeover, but the nature of that takeover and of the system that the communists sought to introduce in East Germany, Poland and Hungary. It is an excellent account of the stages by which the communists seized power. It tells the story not only of the ferocity of communist repression, but also of the endless series of petty and not-so-petty compromises by which the mass of the population was persuaded to acquiesce in communist rule.</p> <p>I would differ somewhat with Applebaum on certain questions of emphasis. In addressing the willingness of many progressive intellectuals to go along \u2013 for a time \u2013 with communist rule, she does not perhaps give quite enough importance to widespread belief in the bankruptcy of the pre-1939 political orders; something that emerges clearly from the works of, for example, Polish writers such as <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1980/milosz-bio.html\" title=\"\">Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/apr/06/poland-tadeusz-konwicki-minor-apocalypse\" title=\"\">Tadeusz Konwicki</a>.</p> <p><em>Iron Curtain </em>contains some very vivid descriptions of the creation of new industrial towns in parts of central Europe, and how these were intended as models for the socialist society of the future. She pays due attention to the degree to which \u2013 for a while \u2013 many ordinary people from impoverished backgrounds also shared in this dream. In describing the actual grim realities of life in towns such as <a href=\"http://english.nh.pl/\" title=\"\">Nowa Huta</a>, however, she fails to set this in the context of early industrialisation \u2013 or indeed post-industrialism \u2013 in the world at large. Ideology aside, her picture of alcoholism, violence and prostitution amid urban deserts does not differ significantly from that in many parts of the capitalist world in the past and today.</p> <p>The choice of 1944 to 1956 as a period to study is legitimate, spanning as it does the communist seizure of power, the period of Stalinism and the changes after Stalin's death, culminating in the critically important but very different outcomes in Poland and Hungary. In <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/23/newsid_3140000/3140400.stm\" title=\"\">Hungary, this period ended with a violent anti-communist revolt</a> which was crushed by the Soviet army, thereby doing catastrophic damage to the image of communism in many parts of the world. In Poland, it ended with Soviet acquiescence in the coming to power of national communists who ushered in a much milder form of communist rule.</p> <p>Nonetheless, by taking the area and the period that she does, Applebaum makes her political case a good deal easier. Had she extended her study to cover the entire period of communist rule in eastern Europe, she would have had to examine how in Poland and Hungary communist rule remained authoritarian but ceased to be totalitarian, and how \u2013 contrary to the predictions of western rightwingers \u2013 communism eventually collapsed remarkably peacefully, above all because of changes in the Soviet Union itself.</p> <p>Moreover, by 1989, the most savagely totalitarian large communist country in eastern Europe \u2013 Romania \u2013 was no longer under Soviet geopolitical domination, and the repulsive <a href=\"http://www.rferl.org/content/Behind_Facade_Ceausescu_Regime/1145867.html\" title=\"\">Ceaucescu regime</a> was being wooed by western countries as part of their anti-Soviet strategy. Elsewhere in the world, the balance of morality between the west and the Soviet Union became even more complicated as the cold war continued.</p> <p>In Europe, however, the contrast between the horrors of Stalinist communism and the benefits of democratic capitalism became clear enough in these years, and younger European readers today need to be reminded of this \u2013 though not perhaps for entirely the reasons that Applebaum thinks. For communism to collapse in eastern Europe \u2013 spiritually in the late 50s, politically in the late 80s \u2013 ordinary people had to see that western democratic capitalism really did work better for them. This was not necessarily apparent in 1945. By the mid-50s, it was incontrovertible. This has a lesson for the present. It is not enough to assert as an article of faith the superiority of liberal capitalist democracy. If our system is to win and retain mass support as against other systems, it has to be seen to be superior.</p> <p>And the system which in the 50s showed itself to be superior to communism was not the \"turbo-charged\" free market capitalism of the Washington Consensus that led us into the crash of 2008. It was free-market democratic capitalism, yes, but it was also social-market capitalism, above all in West Germany, the frontline of cold war competition. It was to join this kind of system that millions of East Germans fled to West Germany and not the other way round. Once they became aware of social-market capitalism's benefits, millions of Russians also eventually decided to end communist rule.</p> <p>The problem is that in the 90s Russians did not get this kind of social market system, but something much closer to the feral capitalism of communist propaganda, with pseudo-democracy as a veil for the looting of the state by the new elites. The contrast between communist dreams and capitalist reality in western and central Europe explains the failure of communism. The contrast between democratic dreams and capitalist reality in Russia explains Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>\u2022 Anatol Lieven is a professor in the war studies department of King's College London.</p>",
  "<p>Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn's mothers don't always behave as they should; they are often unpredictable, occasionally downright troublesome, prone to gusts of passion or rage or \u2013 worse \u2013 unnatural indifference. Rarely are they uncomplicated figures of placid, nurturing devotion; but they do make for fantastically involving fiction. In his 2006 short-story collection, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/16/fiction.colmtoibin\" title=\"\"><em>Mothers and Sons</em></a>, T\u00f3ib\u00edn brought us relationships that were often characterised by the way they inverted traditional roles. An entrepreneurial widow plots to escape to the anonymity of the big city, clashing with her son's determination to hold fast to their small-town life; another man slinks away from a crowded pub rather than be spotted by the celebrated mother who has absented herself from his life; in \"A Long Winter\", a magnificent extended piece set in rural Spain, a young man is forced to keep house ineptly for his father after his alcoholic mother walks out into a snowstorm rather than be deprived of drink.</p> <p>It's not just made up mothers, either. <em>A Guest at the Feast</em>, the short memoir that T\u00f3ib\u00edn released as a Penguin Special ebook at the end of last year, contains tremendously tender, poignant portraits of his mother, father and other family members. But one memorable passage also depicts his mother on the warpath, as the young T\u00f3ib\u00edn runs into trouble at school:</p> <p>Now she went and got her hair done and put on her best high heels and set out for the monastery. For days afterwards, she gave anyone who called a vivid account of her interview with Brother Carbery. She told him she had no interest in anything he had to say, she was here to talk and not to listen. And she was here to tell him that if I didn't get a scholarship, declensions or no declensions, she would blame him personally and write to the head of the Christian Brothers in Ireland about him.</p> <p>It was deliciously unfair.</p> <p>It is no surprise, then, to discover more than a hint of that determination to face down authority and to have one's opinion heard in T\u00f3ib\u00edn's depiction of the most famous mother of all. <em>The Testament of Mary</em>, a novella that first manifested itself as the stage-play <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/oct/05/testament-review\" title=\"\"><em>Testament</em></a>, is bereft of high heels, or new hairdos, or mothers laying down the law; it is pitched in a far quieter and less dramatic register. But we are left in little doubt that its narrator, a woman mourning the death of her son and called upon to give an account of his life to two unnamed visitors, is more angry than she is accepting.</p> <p>The mother of Jesus \u2013 she cannot bring herself to utter his name, referring to him only as \"my son\", or \"the one who was here\" or, to her interlocutors, \"the one you are interested in\" \u2013 is living in a small house in Ephesus; after the crucifixion, when all those close to him came under surveillance and suspicion, she was spirited away by \"the Beloved Disciple\", whom we may fairly assume is John, the author of the fourth gospel. Now, some years later, he has returned with another man to question her. Again, we assume that he is in the act of writing his account of the times; what she says, therefore, will not only be part of the founding of a new religion, but also ensure the posterity of its author.</p> <p>What her visitors want is someone pliable, on-side, part of the project, someone who will satisfy their \"vast and insatiable needs\"; what they get is low-key resistance. \"Just as I cannot breathe the breath of another,\" Mary tells us, \"or help the heart of someone else to beat or their bones not to weaken or their flesh not to shrivel, I cannot say more than I can say.\"</p> <p>Instead, she tells the reader her story: the ambivalence, bordering on dislike, she feels for her son's followers, whom she describes as misfits, \"fools, twitchers, malcontents, stammerers\"; the estrangement she feels when he sheds his boyhood identity and becomes someone else, \"his voice all false, and his tone all stilted\". That estrangement reaches its height when, at the wedding feast in Cana, Jesus appears not to recognise his mother; he has become, she realises without rancour or self-pity, filled with \"unthinking energy\". Leaving the wedding, she almost turns back, but does not.</p> <p>T\u00f3ib\u00edn recounts a handful of these familiar stories, on each occasion making them subtly disturbing. The wedding, for example, includes an almost jocular aside about the lavishness of the gifts and the bride's clothes that first calls to mind the excess of contemporary weddings and then prompts a reflection on Mary and the cult of virginity. The resurrection of Lazarus is used as a way of thinking about the desirability \u2013 or otherwise \u2013 of immortality, the profound impact it might have on what it means to be&#xa0;human.</p> <p>The book's climax comes, of course, with the crucifixion. Here, Mary gives full rein not only to her love for her son but to her understanding of the limits of their bond; \"the pain was his and not mine\", she says, unburdening herself of a final moment of weakness that her visitors would rather not hear. \"The truth should be spoken at least once in the world.\"</p> <p>That truth, as T\u00f3ib\u00edn imagines it in this fearsomely strange, deeply thoughtful book, is far more subversive than it might at first seem. It runs counter to much Marian doctrine and many of the beliefs of the Roman Catholic church, not least the power of Mary to intercede on our behalf. The Mary who sits in her darkened house in Ephesus would not, I think, willingly take on the prayers of the world; all that she wishes for, she tells us at the book's close, is to confine dreams to the night-time and living to the daytime, and to live \"in full recognition of the difference between the two\".</p>",
  "<p>Last winter Europe was basking in its best snow season since social networks began. My friends' timelines were abuzz with updates and images chronicling the ridiculous amount of snow falling in the Alps. All of which would have been fine if I wasn't heading to the usually snowsure state of Colorado for 10 days, where it was having its \"worst\" winter for a decade.</p> <p>It hadn't snowed for two weeks and nothing was forecast for the duration of my stay. Landing under a starry sky in Durango \u2013 after a short internal hop from Denver \u2013 my planned powder quest was looking like a non-starter. I resolved to keep Wi-Fi off until my return home. Yet, even though not a flake fell, two mornings later I was carving turns in soft, untracked snow under a blazing sun and blue sky without a soul in sight.</p> <p>The San Juan mountains are a rugged range in the Rockies of south-western Colorado. Its resorts, unlike those that cluster around Denver, boast uncluttered slopes, minimal lift queues and far fewer British visitors. The region is famous for having the highest concentration of fourteeners (14,000ft peaks) in North America. It's popular with skiers and snowboarders seeking fresh snow and many of them are prepared to forgo the ski lifts and hike, ski tour or splitboard to access the finest untouched powder.</p> <p>Along Route 550, the road between Durango and Silverton, local powder-hounds pick the lines they fancy riding as they drive along the interstate, and their parked cars cluster around favourite starting points. The former 19th-century mining hub of Durango, still atmospherically soundtracked by a steam locomotive (now operated just for tourists to Silverton and back), is a friendly, outdoorsy town, which champions local produce, brews its own beer and boasts canyon vistas straight out of a western. In fact, many westerns have been filmed here and the Rochester Hotel (<a href=\"http://rochesterhotel.com/\" title=\"\">rochesterhotel.com</a>) in town pays tribute to them with themed rooms and marquee light-framed posters in the hallways.</p> <p>I spent my first day at nearby Durango Mountain Resort. It's a fun venue with striking views and though it wasn't particularly taxing terrain, it was a good place to get my legs back and my lungs used to the altitude \u2013 the town sits at 1,988m, with the resort summit at 3,299m.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398412964\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2012/10/26/1351254705840/The-former-mining-town-of-001.jpg\" alt=\"The former mining town of Silverton with San Juan Range of the Rockies in the background.\" width=\"460\" height=\"305\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The former mining town of Silverton with San Juan Range of the Rockies in the background. Photograph: Robert Francis/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Francis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To reach the best snow, I hired a guide \u2013 Josh from Kling Mountain Guides \u2013 who took me to a hire shop to pick up a splitboard for me to try, so we could hike to the powder stashes along the highway.</p> <p>\"So where are we off to,\" I asked. Josh pointed to a map of frequent avalanche paths in the region. \"Oh right,\" I said, \"So we'll avoid them?\"</p> <p>\"No,\" he said. \"That's where we'll find the best snow.\"</p> <p>Our target was McMillan Peak, a relatively straightforward climb with a rise of 550m from the car, at 3,352m, to the peak, at 3,902m. I was surprised to go from feeling like a waddling duck to a cross-country skier in a relatively short time as we nestled our fat \"skis\" into some ski touring tracks, which gently took us through a pine forest, past a couple of old mining huts, and then up steeper sections where I experienced the cool Spiderman-stick of my skins.</p> <p>At the summit a 360-degree panorama of snow-capped peaks spread before us, and while I caught my breath and took on some carbs, Josh pointed out gnarly couloirs he skied with friends on his days off. Our own descent was sublime. The snow might have been old but it was deep and dry in a way you rarely experience in Europe, though I struggled a little with the extra weight of the splitboard. By mid-afternoon, following a couple of short hikes, I wanted nothing more than to lie like a starfish in the snow and kip.</p> <p>The next day I let a snowcat do the uphill work for me. San Juan Snowcat Skiing operates off the back of Durango Mountain Resort, and claims to be the largest snowcat operation in Colorado, with a 60-square-mile playground at its disposal.</p> <p>I joined a group of eight to tackle a wind-shaped moonscape called Graysill Mountain. We accessed its 3,505m summit by taking chair one at Durango, followed by a smooth seven-mile drive in a van with snow-tyres and then a two-mile snowcat trip to the top. We managed 10&#xa0;drops throughout the day, with slight tweaks on that original route, sometimes carving through crusty snow, sometimes flying through nose-deep powder, straight-lining between the trees, and looking out for the occasional comedy wipeout. They call such falls a \"yard sale\" over here, which made sense once I'd watched a guy painstakingly retrieve two skis, a pair of goggles and a helmet camera dotted around the landscape slope above him. While you'd definitely have needed some off-piste experience for Durango, especially for the deeper sections, the terrain was rarely intimidatingly steep.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398412965\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2012/10/26/1351254798891/Snowboarding-on-Silverton-001.jpg\" alt=\"Snowboarding on Silverton Mountain\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Snowboarding on Silverton Mountain Photograph: Jon Paciaroni/Getty Images/Flickr</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Paciaroni/Getty Images/Flickr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My next stop, Silverton Mountain, is an hour's drive down the highway; so you need a hire car out here. It's an expert-only resort, where all runs are at least 35 degrees (30 degrees is considered steep in most ski resorts), are un-groomed, and start with a hike from a solitary two-man chair up to 3,700m, which has no safety bar, and swings like a pendulum in the wind, up to 3,700m. In February, the avalanche risk is so high only skiers with a guide are allowed on the mountain. For the rest of the season you can go it alone, but I joined a guided group anyway, hired an avalanche transceiver, probe and shovel, and signed a waiver reminding me: \"You could die here today.\"</p> <p>Silverton Mountain was created by husband-and-wife team, Jen and Aaron Brill, in 2002. The pair actually bought the land and the lift themselves, , inspired by the community-owned club ski fields they'd seen in New Zealand, taking advantage of its perma-sunken price \u2013 the last mine having closed in the region in 1991 \u2013 and the fact that no one was able to build on it as it was on an avalanche path.</p> <p>It normally snows 10 metres a year in Silverton, and yet it rarely attracts more than 80 skiers or snowboarders a day, so the chances of untracked powder are high. The lack of nearby airports or feasible sites to build one means this is unlikely to change. The resort is only open Thursday to Sunday and from the bravado-heavy chat that takes place in the beer tent/ticket office it's clearly trading well on its \"extreme\" tag. Professional snowboarder <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_White\" title=\"\">Shaun White</a> had his own secret halfpipe built nearby to train for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, lending more kudos to the area.</p> <p>Though I would have rather have tackled its bowls and chutes with fresher snow and fresher legs, Silverton still had some great snow stashes and is without doubt one of the most hardcore places I've ever snowboarded. After a fantastic day, we drove back from the lift station to the one-horse town of Silverton, and the Teller House Hotel, which was built in 1896, and still oozes <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age\" title=\"\">Gilded-Age</a> charm, with its lace curtains, wood panelling and portraits. Walking down Main Street among the brightly coloured shopfronts, swinging saloon doors and clockhouse, the town's gold and silver mining history felt like it happened just days ago.</p> <p>From Silverton a two-hour drive of dramatic bends, sheer drops, frozen waterfalls and a high mountain pass brought us to American celeb's favourite, Telluride. Here we found fantastic hike-to inbounds terrain, many reached in 1\u00bd hour's walk from a lift. Palmyra Peak, at just over 4,000m, and one and half hour's hike from the lift, was the standout, if your knocking knees can get past the super steep couloir at the start.</p> <p>Another two hours on from Telluride is Monarch; a very different resort. Small, low-key and affordable, it has a retro, family feel, and one of the oldest ski runs in Colorado \u2013 the Gunbarrel which opened in 1939. The tight tree skiing, natural hits and drops, and minimal queues, even on a powder day made for a fun stay. There are also 130 acres of steep, expert-only backcountry terrain in the Mirkwood Basin, which you can either hike to or reach on a snowcat.</p> <p>Hotels can be found nearer the resort but we stayed in the old railway town of Salida, a 20-minute drive away, and enjoyed the red-brick buildings, thrift shops and real ale-touting gastro bars downtown. From there we completed our loop with a three-and-a-half-hour drive to Denver, where, of course, fat flakes of snow were just starting to fall.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Visit Colorado (<a href=\"http://www.colorado.com/\" title=\"\">colorado.com</a>) provided accommodation at the Rochester Hotel (<a href=\"http://rochesterhotel.com/\" title=\"\">rochesterhotel.com</a>) and Teller House Hotel (<a href=\"http://www.tellerhouse.com/\" title=\"\">tellerhouse.com</a>), guiding through Kling Mountain Guides (<a href=\"http://klingmountainguides.com/\" title=\"\">klingmountainguides.com</a>), San Juan Snowcat Skiing (<a href=\"http://sanjuanski.com/\" title=\"\">sanjuanski.com</a>) and Silverton Mountain (<a href=\"http://silvertonmountain.com/page/home\" title=\"\">silvertonmountain.com</a>), and a return flight with British Airways from Heathrow to Denver (<a href=\"http://www.britishairways.com/travel/globalgateway.jsp/global/public/en_\" title=\"\">ba.com</a>), and United Airlines from Denver to Durango (<a href=\"https://www.united.com/web/en-US/default.aspx?SID=13CF4F7F7D584188B0DF6E88954B3314\" title=\"\">united.com</a>).

  "<p>Barack Obama received a pre-election boost on Friday when the latest economic figures showed a higher-than-expected rise in growth as both the Democratic and Republican teams stepped up efforts to break the deadlock before November 6.</p> <p>The growth was fuelled by rising consumer confidence, the fledgling recovery in the housing market and an uptick in government spending.</p> <p>The worry for Democrats is that the favourable figures may be arriving too late to have a big impact on the election.</p> <p>Obama and Republican presidential challenger Mitt Romney are stuck on 47% each in the polls, according to the average of polls on Real Clear Politics, and looking for an issue that will tip the balance in their favour in the final days of the campaign.</p> <p>There are big variations between individual polls, with the latest Gallup daily tracking poll putting Romney back up five points, on 51% to Obama's 46%.</p> <p>A CNN poll in Ohio, which has emerged as the pivotal state of the election, attracting more visits by the candidates than any other, shows Obama is on 50% to Romney's 46%. Republican senator Rob Portman, who is co-chair of Romney's campaign, admitted on NBC that it would be hard for Romney to win the White House without Ohio.</p> <p>Romney delivered a speech in Ames, Iowa, another swing state, what his aides had billed as a major address on the economic but in fact contained nothing new in terms of policy. He had one fresh rhetorical line, rehearsed by the Romney campaign in an ad earlier in the week, in which he accused Obama of focusing on trivial issues because he had no record worth fighting the election on.</p> <p>\"This is an election of consequence. Our campaign is about big things, because we happen to believe that America faces big challenges. We recognise this is a year with a big choice, and the American people want to see big changes. And together we can bring real change to this country,\" Romney said.</p> <p>\"Four years ago, candidate Obama spoke to the scale of the times. Today, he shrinks from it, trying instead to distract our attention from the biggest issues to the smallest, from characters on Sesame Street and silly word games to misdirected personal attacks he knows are false.\"</p> <p>He then returned to what is basically his stump speech.</p> <p>Although the election has been largely dominated by the economy, it has broadened to encompass social issues, mainly abortion and rape, and, more recently, racial tensions.</p> <p>On abortion and rape, the Obama campaign put out a new web page with a clock marking how long Romney has maintained his endorsement of Indiana senate candidate Richard Mourdock who on Tuesday said that that pregnancies from rape are \"something that God intended\". It follows a claim by another Republican senate candidate, Todd Akin, in Missouri, who used the phrase \"legitimate rape\".</p> <p>On race, the former governor of New Hampshire, John Sununu \u2013&#xa0;a leading Romney surrogates \u2013 was forced to go into reverse after suggesting that Colin Powell, a secretary of state in the George W Bush administration, had endorsed Obama simply because he is black.</p> <p>Democrats claimed this was not an off-the-cuff remark but part of a deliberate strategy on the part of the Romney campaign to make race an issue. A Washington Post poll this week showed fewer whites supporting Obama in this election than in 2008.</p> <p>Obama's 2008 opponent John McCain beat him among white voters by 12 points. According to the Washington Post poll, Obama is trailing Romney among whites by 23 points.</p> <p>On Friday, Sununu backtracked over his remark about Powell's endorsement. \"Colin Powell is a friend and I respect the endorsement decision he made and I do not doubt that it was based on anything but his support of the president's policies,\" Sununu, a former White House chief of staff, said.</p> <p>On Thursday night, speaking on CNN, Sununu had said: \"Frankly, when you take a look at Colin Powell, you have to wonder if that's an endorsement based on issues, or whether he's got a slightly different reason for preferring president Obama?\" Asked what reason that might be, Sununu said: \"Well, I think when you have somebody of your own race that you're proud of being president of the United States, I applaud Colin for standing with him.\"</p> <p>Tad Devine, a senior adviser to the Gore campaign in 2000 and Kerry in 2004, saw this as part of a Republican strategy aimed at making race part of the campaign. \"I believe there is a systematic effort on the part of the Republican party to introduce a racial component into this election \u2026 I don't think this is accidently shooting off at the mouth.\"</p> <p>Obama, speaking to Democratic campaign workers in his hometown Chicago on Thursday night before flying back to Washington, acknowledged that the race is close and that he might lose, while adding he still expected to win.</p> <p>\"This is going to be a close election, so we just got to work really hard over these next 12 days. If we let up and our voters don't turn out, we could lose this election,\" Obama said:.\"Now the good news is, if our voters do turn out, we will definitely win the election.\"</p> <p>The president spent Friday in the White House doing 10 interviews, mainly with media from the swing states that will decide the outcome on November 6, while Romney continued his campaign tour in Iowa and Ohio.</p> <p>The White House welcomed the news from the department of commerce on economic growth. Although the economy remains sluggish, this was the 13th straight month of growth.</p> <p>Alan Krueger, chairman of the White House council of economic advisers, said that over those 13 months the economy had expanded by 7.2% overall.</p> <p>\"While we have more work to do, together with other economic indicators, this report provides further evidence that the economy is moving in the right direction.,\" he said.</p> <p>The figures on growth, the last from the commerce department before the election, come after unemployment statistics released earlier this month showed a drop below the symbolically important 8%. The next unemployment figures are due just before polling day.</p> <p>Romney described the growth figures as discouraging. \"Slow economic growth means slow job growth and declining take-home pay. This is what four years of president Obama's policies have produced. Americans are ready for change \u2014 for growth, for jobs, for higher take-home pay,\" he said in a statement.</p> <p>In spite of the increase in consumer confidence, businesses are reining themselves in, worried about the so-called 'fiscal cliff\" at the end of the year when Bush-era tax cuts are due to expire and massive spending cuts scheduled to kick in unless there is a political compromise.</p> <p>With 10 days left to the election, the Obama campaign claims to have a slight edge in the swing states and to have stopped the momentum that Romney built up after his debate victory in Denver on December 3. The Romney campaign insisted that the momentum is still with them, bringing into play more states, such as Wisconsin.</p>",
  "<p>Technology is always, in the end, a bit disappointing, if only because we tend to burden it with such imaginative expectations. For example, despite the best efforts of comics across several generations, there is no sign anywhere of the disintegrator ray, or of the metallic silver face visor, or of entire meals that come in pellet form and taste delicious slipped casually into a glass of water. Robots in particular have been a massive disappointment. Doing the&#xa0;hoovering, dancing on YouTube, walking a dog in Japan: robots are better than this.</p> <p>The idea has always been that robots would at some point become evil, develop a malevolent intelligence, learn to run fast in a frightening, spidery way, and finally assume control of our barren, dust-blown future world, thereby confirming the ancient narrative of mankind's destruction by its own hand whether by \u2013 ahem \u2013 accumulated sin or by a successful and concerted robot uprising. Basically robots need to take a good look at themselves.</p> <p>Sometimes though technology simply dies a natural death, outmoded by other, newer technology. This is pretty much what has happened to teletext \u2013 also known variously as Ceefax, Oracle or The One On Channel 4 \u2013 which died this week after 38 years of service, much of it related to coverage of sport. The original horse-drawn internet, Ceefax is finally no more: a brilliantly cheap, brilliantly simple, hugely successful piece of technology that somehow seemed to age at triple-speed.</p> <p>There was some excitement on the day after Ceefax's final page, a kind of suicide note (\"I have been frozen out, another victim of BBC ageism\") as though \u2013 ha ha \u2013 there actually had been a death. This seems an unnecessary lightening of a what is a genuine moment of machine-bereavement, the disappearance for ever of the hidden robot face behind your TV screen.</p> <p>It will be a source of minor sadness for anybody who came to rely on that discreet but authoritative presence during those analogue years when, pre-rolling news, TV text had an absolute monopoly on these things. It was all so beautifully simple. Ceefax came in three formats. There. Not there. Or the upsetting and unnecessary \"mix\", which produced a horrible melding of overlaid text and TV pictures, based around an idea that it might be agreeable to \"watch\" Ceefax and moving pictures simultaneously, creating a kind of nightmare cyborg world of spectral floating league tables and walking babbling human beings, faces obscured by phrases like \"Swindon Town\" and \"Michael Atherton\", first unwitting victims of some strangulating football text-based robot dawn.</p> <p>Above all Ceefax was brilliant for sport. Even in death its page numbers remain horribly vital. Page 302 \u2013 a familiar spasm of finger and thumb \u2013 was football headlines. This was the real heart of Ceefax. Page 300 was always technically the sport home page, but there was something a little too diffuse&#xa0;and scattered about it, where the real strength of Ceefax was its remorseless focus. Page 324 was league tables. 316 was scores. 312, my thumb and finger want to tell me, was news in brief. Page 340 was the gateway to cricket, where my own favourite Ceefax memory was spent watching the numbers slowly flicker past as Brian Lara scored the last 200 runs of his world record 501 not out against Durham in 1994, an experience that ended with hugs and handshakes around the room, a sense of binding shared achievement, of really having seen the refresh function on page 347 through those difficult final overs. I saw the Lara 501 moment again later on TV: a roly-poly part-time early-evening half-volley thrashed through the covers to scattered whoops from the ground staff It was, frankly, no competition.</p> <p>Beyond this Ceefax was an example of genuine technical ingenuity, a BBC invention devised in the early 1970s by Corporation engineers in Surrey who found a way of sending information encrypted within the ordinary analogue TV signal. The Ceefax service was officially launched in June 1974, broadcast through a mini-computer known as \"Esmerelda\".</p> <p>And for a while it was Ceefax fever out there, the miracle of man-made electric TV-words driving a nationwide upgrading of TV sets along the lines of the recent flat-screen rush. In October 1981 the government announced the first \u2013 and, it turns out, only \u2013 National Teletext Month, as the British model for TV text services was rolled out around the world.</p> <p>Mainly Ceefax was that vanished thing, a voice of quiet authority: entirely straight, irreproachably trustworthy, even its name \u2013 \"see facts\" \u2013 devoid of all frippery. Ceefax had no side to it. Not only was its prose furiously disciplined, it was also entirely free of vanity. And in this it was, pertinently, an emblem of the BBC at its best.</p> <p>Ceefax had no byline picture. It had no angle to work, no cloud of nuanced personal ambition. Even in death there will be no Ceefax sex scandal. Ceefax did not have a caravan. Ceefax didn't want to feel you up. Ceefax wouldn't come jangling and panting and scrabbling at your door after lights out. In fact Ceefax had no interest in you at all. And this was the real nub, perhaps even its greatest distinction: it was courteously and brusquely non-interactive, unscarred by the current urge to embellish all \u2013 Have your shout! Speak your spume! Tell Us what YOU think even if it is essentially INANE and imitative MEWLING! \u2013 with the legitimising babble of transient public opinion.</p> <p>Perhaps we could still learn a little from Ceefax's orderly restraint at a time when all broadcasting seems intent on thrusting its great meaty fists out through the screen and presenting not so much a sense of authority, as a babble of shared misdirection, and when Sky Sports is even now broadcasting a kind of man-Ceefax on Saturday afternoons, a Ceefax of the flesh with real actual men dressed in wedding suits and ranged in front of invisible screens, frowning, shrugging, squawking, and essentially being human Ceefax on a grand, mob-handed scale.</p> <p>Faced with this Ceefax already seems laughably old-fashioned, not just over but entirely outside its time, untuned to the rhythms of a more voracious, participatory, chaotically needy media. The chair is now empty. The face behind the screen has gone, a last broadcasting hero of an age that has decisively passed.</p>",
  "<p>Mix It Up at Lunch Day is one of those programs that just seems like a nice thing to do.</p> <p>The idea is that on one day of the school year, kids are invited to have lunch with the kind of kids they don't usually hang out with: the jocks mix with the nerds, lunch tables are racially integrated, et cetera. Sponsored by the Southern Poverty Law Center as part of their <a href=\"http://www.splcenter.org/what-we-do/teaching-tolerance\">Teaching Tolerance</a> division, it arose out of a broad effort to tackle the problems of bullying in the schools and bigotry in society \u2013 and it appears to have been effective in breaking down stereotypes and reducing prejudice. Over 2,000 schools nationwide now participate in the program, which is set to take place this year on 30 October.</p> <p>You can argue about how permanent its effects are, or whether other approaches might be better, but the idea of making new friends in the lunchroom seems utterly benign. Right?</p> <p>Wrong, as it turns out \u2013 at least, according to the American Family Association, a radical rightwing evangelical policy group. Mix It Up at Lunch Day is, in fact, part of \"a nationwide push to promote the homosexual lifestyle in public schools\", <a href=\"http://www.afa.net/Detail.aspx?id=2147527678\">according to the AFA literature</a>. The program \"is an entry-level 'diversity' program designed specifically by SPCL (sic) to establish the acceptance of homosexuality into public schools, including elementary and junior high schools,\" warns the AFA website. \"See if your child's school is on the list.\"</p> <p>The AFA&#xa0;has urged parents to keep their kids home on 30 October, and claims that at least 200 schools have responded to its charge by canceling the program.</p> <p>There's a backstory here. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which has fought for civil rights causes since its founding in 1971, conceived and promoted Mix It Up at Lunch as part of their Teaching Tolerance program. The SPLC also, as it happens, named the AFA, along with a dozen other \"pro-family\" groups, as a \"hate group\" in 2010, citing, among other factors, AFA's expressed views on same-sex relationships. The \"homosexual agenda\" is not the only factor in the SPLC's decision to include AFA on the list. <a href=\"http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/profiles/bryan-fischer\">AFA's director of issues analysis, Bryan Fischer</a>, has appeared to suggest <a href=\"http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/afas-fischer-god-obviously-looking-more-phinehases-our-day\">that what is biblically deemed \"sexual immorality\" merits punishment by death</a>. He evidently hates Muslims, too, having recently opined that \"allowing a mosque to be built in town is fundamentally no different than granting a building permit to a KKK cultural center\".</p> <p>So, now it's payback time. The <a href=\"http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/fischer/121018\">AFA's jihad against Mix It Up at Lunch Day</a> is its way of saying \"I'm rubber, you're glue.\" It has come up with its own list of boycotts and hate groups, and sure enough the SPLC, on account of its \"incendiary language\", is on that list. </p> <p>Funny word games aside, the SPLC is right. It is, by now, well known that the AFA and the kind of interests they represent spread conspiratorial falsehoods about the LGBT community, placing blame for a wide variety of social ills on a \"gay agenda\". They also seem to support a certain type of bullying and bigotry in public schools \u2013 the faith-based kind \u2013 and believe there should be more of it. </p> <p>One example comes from an AFA cultural ally: Gateways to Better Education, formed in 1991 by Focus on the Family in tandem&#xa0;with a rightwing Christian legal advocacy group that calls itself the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF). Gateways publishes a \"Guide&#xa0;for Commemorating Religious Freedom at School\". But the freedom Gateways and the ADF have in mind applies&#xa0;only to those who share their religion.</p> <p>\"Religious Freedom Day is not 'celebrate-our-diversity-day,'\" <a href=\"http://religiousfreedomday.com/foreducators.html\">members are reminded</a>. Gateways advocates a \"Biblical approach to tolerance\", which apparently consists of intolerant attitudes toward what the ADF and Gateways call <a href=\"http://www.alliancedefendingfreedom.org/News/PRDetail/5624\">\"pro-homosexual education\"</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gtbe.org/news/index.php/4/18.html\">\"the gay activist agenda\"</a>. Parents' No 1 goal, they say, should be to \"encourage your children to be bolder\" in expressing their faith at school.</p> <p>The far right's fixation on same-sex relationships is so ludicrous that it defines a sub-category of camp. But let's take a step back for a moment. The big question, the one that keeps coming back in every one of these skirmishes in the culture wars, is: why is the loudest religion in American politics today so much about hate?</p> <p>Consider Mix it Up at Lunch Day from the perspective of the almost limitless other conceptions of the Christian religion that are out there. You could, for example, construe it as an exercise in \"loving thy neighbor\". You could quote the gospel of John that \"God is love.\" You could view it as part of the religious mission of charity. I have no doubt that there are countless Christian and non-Christian people in the US who would view Mix It Up Day in just this way.</p> <p>So why does the form of religion that seeks to claim the term \"Christian\" in the political realm have to focus so relentlessly on a \"gay conspiracy\" \u2013 not to mention sexually active singles and the purely evil Muslims?</p> <p>I don't believe for a moment that this hysterical voice that screeches in America's political sphere is the authentic voice of religion in America. Most religious Americans want to mix it up at lunch! They want to make friends across party lines, and they want to help people who are less fortunate. A survey by the Public Religious Research Institute, released on 24 October, reveals that 60% of Catholics believe the Church should place a greater emphasis on social justice issues and their obligation to the poor, even if that means focusing less on culture war issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage. Earlier this year, in response to the Ryan budget, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops joined other Christian leaders in insisting that a <a href=\"http://www.usccb.org/news/2012/12-063.cfm\">\"circle of protection\"</a> be drawn around \"essential programs that serve poor and vulnerable people\".</p> <p>So why is it that the so-called \"values voters\" are urged to vote against the politician who supports choice, not the politician who wants to shred that \"circle of protection\" for the poor and vulnerable? Why is it that when politicians want to demonstrate just how religiously righteous they are, they talk about banning same-sex marriage and making contraceptives hard to get, instead of showing what they have done to protect the weak? </p> <p>There is an obvious answer, and it is, in a sense, staring you in the face every time you watch a political debate or read about the latest antics of Focus on the Family and the AFA. The kind of religion that succeeds in politics tends to focus on the divisive element of religion. If you want to use religion to advance a partisan political agenda, the main objective you use it for is to divide people between us and them, between the in-group and the out-group, the believers and the infidels. <br> The result is a reduction of religion to a small handful of wedge issues. According to the religious leaders and policy organizations urging Americans to vote with their \"Biblical values\", to be Christian now means to support one or, at most, a small handful of policy positions. And it means voting for the Republican party. </p> <p>This type of rhetoric is also championed by a segment of Jewish conservatives. Alarmed that Obama won 78% of the Jewish vote in 2008, they accused Democratic Jews of being \"Jinos\" \u2013 Jews In Name Only. \"They eat bagels and lox; they watch 'Schindler's List,'\" writes <a href=\"http://townhall.com/columnists/benshapiro/2011/05/25/jews_in_name_only/page/full/\">Town Hall columnist Ben Shapiro</a>, \"but they do not care about Israel\" \u2013 at least, not in the way that Shapiro thinks we should. </p> <p>When religion is thus reduced to a single policy decision and support for a political party, it becomes shrill and bigoted. This abuse of religion for political purposes has been tremendously damaging for American politics. But it is worth pointing out that it has been destructive of religion, too. According to another poll this month, this one <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/09/no-religion-pew-report_n_1949598.html\">by the Pew Research Center</a>, record numbers of Americans are now reporting that they have no particular religious affiliation. Perhaps that is because, right now, the God of hate seems to be shouting louder than the God of love.</p>",
  "<p>The best stories in boxing invariably can be told only when the principals are dead. This is one of those stories.</p> <p>Manny Steward died on Thursday, aged 68, after losing a fight with cancer, and he leaves a legacy of excellence few in the history of the sport can match, the trainer of more than 40 world champions, most notably Tommy Hearns, Lennox Lewis and Wladimir Klitschko.</p> <p>Steward's first champion was not, as is often assumed, his masterpiece Hearns, the most illustrious student of his renowned Kronk gym in Detroit, but a fighter from outside that setup, Hilmer Kenty. The Texan was a lightweight of decent skill but no profile and how Steward got him his title shot sheds an interesting light on the workings of the fight game.</p> <p>In 1980, Steward took a trip to Puerto Rico to meet a character called Pepe Cordero, whose main function in life was as a go-between for the World Boxing Association; if you wanted a title shot, the quickest way was to pay Cordero (who has since died, largely unmourned).</p> <p>\"I heard they needed an opponent for the lightweight champion Ernesto Espa\u00f1a,\" Steward told the late Harry Mullan, editor of Boxing News, in 1997. The trainer, by now also a manager, related how Cordero, Espa\u00f1a's manager, took out a gun and put it on the table between them. He demanded $100,000 for the champion, $25,000 for the ageing welterweight Angel Espada, who was to be featured on the undercard, and $25,000 for himself.</p> <p>\"When the deal was done,\" Steward said, \"I was committed to something like $300,000.\"</p> <p>But Steward made plenty of money, too, turning his wit from the gym to the negotiating table and always struck a good deal with the many fine champions he trained. It was a mark of his genius that the best boxers in the world appreciated his input every bit as much as the novices, even though he never boxed professionally.</p> <p>Steward, by all accounts, was an outstanding amateur bantamweight, tall and rangy with keen boxing instincts honed in illegal fights as a teenager in the mountains of West Virginia, where he grew up. He won a national Golden Gloves title in 1964 but chose not to try for the US Olympics team, opting instead for the security of a job as an electrician.</p> <p>Tempted back to boxing two years later by his half-brother, he learnt the skills of coaching from the acknowledged master, Eddie Futch, and passed on that knowledge to a string of fine fighters, many of them from the Motor City.</p> <p>He elicited two key fundamentals from Futch: the meticulous wrapping of a boxer's hands, with the tape ending up in a tight knot in the middle of each hand; and instructing his fighters to tighten and turn their fists immediately before impact.</p> <p>\"I love knockouts,\" Steward told me, \"and those are two ways to make them happen, along with speed. Speed kills.\"</p> <p>When Hearns walked into the Kronk in a run-down part of Detroit as the skinniest 14-year-old Steward had ever seen, they clicked immediately but Hearns, the first boxer to win five world titles at different weights, was no great puncher until Steward turned him into the original \"Hitman\".</p> <p>The trainer stayed by Hearns's side through the many good times and a few not so good. He tried often to persuade him to quit when he had clearly seen better nights but was there for him when the 41-year-old Hearns came to the UK in 1999 and was the beneficiary of a close points win over Nate Miller. The crowd, who had cheered him in, booed him out. Hearns boxed on until 2006 and had to auction his house and other possessions in 2010 to pay tax and personal debts.</p> <p>Steward trained three British world champions: Lewis, Dennis Andries and Naseem Hamed, as well as Henry Akinwande. Andries was probably his most remarkable student, a crude swinger in a desperate and courageous defeat by Hearns in Detroit, then a disciplined and inordinately tough champion under Steward's subsequent tutelage.</p> <p>Steward was as comfortable with raw material as with the game's naturally gifted performers but he could not tame the wilder side of perhaps his most awesome student, Gerald McClellan.</p> <p>Steward split with McClellan not long before he fought Nigel Benn in London in 1995 and never quite resolved their falling out over money he claimed the fighter owed him. McClellan, who arrived with a rag-tag team and even wrapped his own hands, was left partially blind and deaf after that unforgettable fight.</p> <p>Steward also set up a version of the Kronk gym in London, which flourished briefly, and has been the astute mentor of the world heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko for several years, as well as earning a living as a ringside commentator.</p> <p>The original Kronk has closed, although Steward relocated with some of his boxers to another gym in Detroit .</p> <p>Steward was not alone in his appreciation of money but he husbanded it with greater care than some, notably the two-weight world champion Evander Holyfield, whom he trained for his second fight with Riddick Bowe.</p> <p>The \"Real Deal\" has just turned 50 and, sadly, announced this week he was returning to the ring, one year after his last fight and 28 years since his first as a professional. The man who won five world titles has gone through most of his \u00a3350m fortune, with a little help from the gaming tables of Las Vegas and the five mothers of his 11 children. He had to sell his 109-room mansion for $5m and lives in a small apartment in downtown Atlanta.</p> <p>Kenty? He won that fight against Espa\u00f1a, to become Detroit's first world champion since Joe Louis. He beat Espa\u00f1a again six months later and hung on to his title until Sean O'Grady took it off him in 1981, one of only two defeats in 31 bouts. He retired in 1984 and lives quietly in Detroit, a city \u2013 thanks in part to Emanuel Steward \u2013 almost as famous for its boxers as for its cars.</p>",
  "<h2>1) The Rams must establish the running game</h2> <p>With the multi-faceted Patriots offence capable of lighting up the scoreboard quickly, the Rams must control the clock and keep them off the field by establishing their running game. With two very capable backs \u2013 Steven Jackson and Daryl Richardson, who average 3.8 and 5.1 yards per carry respectively \u2013 they have a duo who complement one another and they should be given every opportunity to run the ball. That doesn't always happen: they ran only 22 times against the Packers last weekend yet averaged 4.9 yards per carry. Establishing the ground game will allow the Rams greater flexibility to attack the Patriots' porous secondary which has hampered them all year. Although the Patriots have intercepted a league-best five passes on throws more than 20 yards downfield, they've also allowed the most completions (18) and conceded five touchdowns off such passes.</p> <h2>2) Brady must be harried</h2> <p>Give the Patriots quarterback Tom Brady time and he will pick you apart. The Patriots have posted at least 350 total net yards in 16 consecutive games, equalling an NFL record, and in the 52-28 demolition of the Bills in week four, Brady threw for 333 yards as the Bills failed to get any pressure on him, only recording one sack. Yet Brady is not as mobile as other elite quarterbacks, so if the Rams defence are aggressive and show some hustle \u2013 especially defensive ends Robert Quinn and Chris Long, who have combined for 11 sacks this year \u2013 they could do some damage. It's noticeable that Brady's completion rate drops to 45.8% when he's pressured and his NFL quarterback rating becomes 74.1, a far cry from his overall rating this season of 96.9.</p> <h2>3) The Patriots will target Jenkins</h2> <p>Brady is one of the elite signal-callers in the NFL but his ability to find the right receiver against the wrong coverage is second to none. True, he has a wealth of offensive weapons but the Patriots' success is founded on him using them effectively and finding defensive weaknesses. And the obvious one to target on Sunday is Rams' rookie cornerback Janoris Jenkins, who has had a rough time versus the Packers and Dolphins recently. In those two games Jenkins was targeted on 19 occasions and the receivers caught the ball on 17 attempts, a conversion rate of 89%. Those sort of numbers will not have gone unnoticed by Patriots' offensive coordinator, Josh McDaniels. Watch out for either Brandon Lloyd or Wes Welker lining up against Jenkins to give him a torrid evening.</p> <h2>4) Watch out for Welker</h2> <p>While Welker may have had his problems <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/news/welker-belichick-comments-joke-210423331%E2%80%93nfl.html\" title=\"\">with the Patriots head coach, Bill Belichick,</a> the cause of that frustration stemmed from earlier in the season when the wide receiver appeared to be getting fewer balls thrown his way. Welker had only eight receptions in the first two weeks of the season and in the second of those games he was demoted from the starting line-up but he is still one of the most productive and consistent receivers in the NFL. His qualities include courage, concentration (especially in traffic) and the ability to separate from coverage \u2013 he already has 54 catches this year and he is the man Brady looks for in crucial situations, especially on third downs.</p> <h2>5) Don't stop watching even if the Patriots are dominating going into the fourth</h2> <p>The Patriots have had problems closing out games all season, even when they have been dominating field position, possession and on the scoreboard. Last Sunday they allowed the Jets to rally and needed a comeback to win the game in overtime to move to 4-3. Part of the Patriots' problem is their inability to score points in the fourth quarter. So far this year they have \"lost\" the last quarter on four occasions but, more worryingly, they have been outscored 55-61 \u2013 and 31 of their 55 points came against the Bills. In their last three games they have been outscored 6-34 in the final quarter. Different theories have been suggested \u2013 the Patriots have talked about losing concentration, while their inability to establish the run in the fourth quarter is another issue \u2013 but it's something they clearly need to sort out. The Patriots used to be considered great closers of matches. Not any more.</p>",
  "<p>Of the two big political transitions ahead of us next month, it is clear which will receive most attention and be the easiest to read. The US presidential election, in spite of some uncertainties about Mr Romney's real position on many issues, is a straightforward and dramatic electoral contest. It will be comprehensively covered everywhere, and its outcome exhaustively analysed. The replacement of China's leadership at the 18th party congress, a couple of days after the American vote, is, by contrast, already foreordained. It looks like Chinese business as usual, and will be an almost entirely opaque process, as unclear in its implications after it is over as it is before it has begun. Yet it is arguably the more important of the two.</p> <p>This is not because China is a bigger power than America, which it is not, and which it may never become. It is because China's accumulated problems are so numerous and its need for reform and renewal so evident that the course its leaders set in the next five years could be more critical for the world than the choices a single American president will make in the four years at his disposal. Ever since it became possible to talk about Chinese politics in something like western terms, outsiders have hoped for reforms that will take the country in the direction of the rule of law and democracy, and reduce its dependence on a combination of nationalism and consumerism as a source of legitimacy. So have many, although it is unclear how many, Chinese. These expectations have usually been disappointed, because both the party and the people in China are frightened of too much change \u2013 the party because it worries that it will lose its grip, and ordinary people because of the memory of the chaos and cruelty of earlier times. However angry they are about official corruption and mismanagement, they fear any lurch into the unknown.</p> <p>Corruption is a key to many aspects of the Chinese situation. As the distinguished British sinologist Roderick MacFarquhar recently argued, high-level Chinese corruption is not just theft. Together with the export of assets abroad, and the despatch of sons and daughters to foreign schools and universities, it suggests that the party brass lacks <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/21/opinion/in-china-fear-at-the-top.html\" title=\"\">confidence in the future</a>. Mao and the other earlier leaders had won the war against the nationalists, created a pervasive and effective party apparatus, and spread an ideology which was widely accepted. All of this is now in the distant past, to the point that, as MacFarquhar writes: \"Globalising one's assets\u2026 makes sense as a hedge against risk.\" The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/business/global/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">revelations</a> in the New York Times this week about the wealth amassed by the family of Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier, will undoubtedly find their way past the state's information filters, and their impact will be the more severe because he has been a relatively popular leader. The<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/26/bo-xilai-expelled-chinese-parliament\" title=\"\"> expulsion </a>of the disgraced Bo Xilai from the party and, yesterday, from parliament, for, among other offences, corruption, is hardly likely to convince a sceptical populace that China's leaders are ready to clean up their act.</p> <p>But that is what a new leadership must do, if it is to transform a society \"unstable at the grass roots, dejected in the middle strata, and out of control at the top\", which is how some Chinese scholars apparently described their country at a recent <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21565132-china%E2%80%99s-communist-party-preparing-its-ten-yearly-change-leadership-new-team\" title=\"\">conference</a> near Shanghai. Similarly, Deng Yuwen, a senior editor at one of the party's journals, has argued that the achievements of the last decade of growth may be outweighed by its failures, especially the <a href=\"http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/america-the-gutted/china-middle-class-economic-growth-wealth-disparity\" title=\"\">\"failure to nurture and grow a middle class\".</a> The most serious failure of all, as the Chinese writer <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2100133,00.html\" title=\"\">Yu Hua</a> has said, is the erosion of political belief and meaning to the point where, as he suggests, the phrase \"the people\" has become \"nothing more than a shell company, utilised by different eras to position different products in the marketplace\". Put that way, there is indeed a long way to go in China.</p>",
  "<p>The teacher's command of his class is total. \"Which one is the whole number?\" he asks crisply. \"Is it seven over three, or is it four?\"</p> <p>He zeroes in on a child who gives the right answer, then the next task: \"Seven over three divided by four over one? Hands, please \u2013 I'm looking for straight arms.\"</p> <p>The classes at Sci Academy, a charter school in New Orleans, feel like an assembly line; with each task stripped down to component parts, and the teacher orchestrating a brisk interaction that draws in students' bodies as well as their minds. They click fingers as a substitute for applause, or to show understanding, and sit poised to attention as the teacher moves around the room.</p> <p>New Orleans is a city that has been failed by government in the past, most tragically when Katrina struck. But one consequence of that disaster has been a root-and-branch transformation of its education system. </p> <p>The reforms had begun before Katrina, but the pace was accelerated after the disaster. It is now the only US city where a majority of public school pupils \u2013 around eight in ten \u2013 attend charter schools, which are non-unionised and enjoy a rare degree of operational independence from government.</p> <p>This academic year brings further change; under reforms brought in by Republican governor Bobby Jindal, poorer students attending poorly performing state schools can apply for vouchers to cover their fees at a private or religious school. Nearly 5,000 students in Louisiana have taken up the voucher programme, making it one of the most popular such initiatives nationally. Similar experiments are underway in several other states including Indiana and Ohio.</p> <p>The creation of a fully-fledged market in education is endorsed by Mitt Romney. If elected, the Republican candidate would provide $25bn in federal money to back school voucher systems.</p> <p>In education, as in health, vouchers are a dividing line between the parties. President Obama has embraced charter schools and increased accountability for teachers, but stops short of letting public money follow children to private schools.</p> <p>The pale blue corridors of Sci Academy, housed in a cluster of prefabricated blocks in New Orleans East, are lined with inspirational mottoes: \"Chase perfection, catch excellence,\" reads one. Another declares: \"We're never done, we're never finished\".</p> <p>The words are directed at students, but could apply just as well to the teachers, who are evaluated on each lesson. Staff here are regularly observed and receive constant feedback on their performance. Closer scrutiny of teachers \u2013 particularly the linking of evaluation to standardised test results \u2013 has been controversial nationally; it was one of the issues at stake in the Chicago teachers' strike.</p> <p>The goal in New Orleans is to reverse years of educational decline. Before Katrina, state schools here had become starkly segregated on race and class lines as white and middle class families removed their children.</p> <p>By 2004 one in three New Orleans students was at a private or religious school, compared with a national average of 11%. In high school exit exams that year, 96% of the city's public school students were below basic proficiency in English.</p> <p>In the years since Katrina, student performance in tests has improved, and fewer students now go to failing schools. Students have achieved a higher average score in the ACT test, which measures readiness for college.</p> <p><a href=\" http://www.coweninstitute.com/\">A study by the Cowen Institute</a> at Tulane University notes the improvement, but is cautious about the reasons why. Many claims have been put forward \"but few have been proven by the available data,\" it says.</p> <p>John White, Louisiana's state superintendent of education, argues that decentralisation has freed schools to act in children's best interests. Charter schools, state-funded but independently run by non-profit groups, are now the norm in New Orleans. In the past school year, 78% of public school students were enrolled in charters. The proportion will rise this year. Such schools enjoy great flexibility in managing their time and allocating resources.</p> <p>White said: \"A lot of this is about ensuring that parents don't leave. It's really not the state that is the best vehicle for keeping parents in our schools, it's the schools, and how do you do that? You create a policy environment where choice is the norm, where schools have the freedom to improve and retain parents. We have a choice and competition model, where schools are competing for the interest of parents.\"</p> <p>In the New Orleans school market, where parents are purchasers and schools tout for custom, the state's role is increasingly to act as a regulator rather than a provider of services.</p> <p>In an attempt to ensure that schools don't game the system, a unified system of enrolment has been introduced for the whole city, with places at oversubscribed schools decided by lottery rather than how close the family lives. Schools must abide by the same rules on exclusions. A network of school buses provides transport, enabling families to choose a school distant from their home.</p> <p>Parents are motivated by a range of inducements, not just a school's academic achievement. Ava Lee, director of the Samuel J Green charter school, says some are attracted to the extended school day, in which children are offered a range of sporting and cultural activities from flag football to African dance. Others appreciate the school's healthy eating ethos; it has an \"edible schoolyard\" growing aubergines, kale, chillies and strawberries. Learning how to cook and eat healthily is on the curriculum here.</p> <p>Lee said: \"Schools receive a report card now, parents are savvy \u2013 they research online and see how a school is performing. It's no longer the neighbourhood school; it's really parent choice.\"</p> <p>The most controversial aspect of the Louisiana reforms is the extension of school choice outside the public system. A pilot voucher programme has existed in New Orleans since 2008, but has been expanded statewide under measures signed into law by Governor Jindal in April. Unlike the pilot, the new programme is open to children from kindergarten to 12th grade. Places at private schools are assigned by lottery and the state voucher covers tuition fees.</p> <h2>The new programme</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398427478\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/26/1351259438636/Sci-Academy-in-New-Orlean-010.jpg\" alt=\"Sci Academy in New Orleans\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sci Academy in New Orleans. Photograph: Julie Dermansky for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julie Dermansky/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>Jack Loup, founder of the Coalition for Louisiana Public Education, argues that there is no evidence to support the view that private schools are better.</p> <p>\"They [private schools] have never taken any tests. I went to a parochial [church] school. I certainly have nothing against them. But they don't take any tests to prove they are doing better than other schools. All they have done is throw it out there, saying parents know what's best for their child \u2013 parents have no idea how well the school is teaching their child.\"</p> <p>The initiative has meant a significant boost to the enrolment of schools like the Life of Christ Christian Academy, a non-denominational religious school in New Orleans. The school, a neat brick cube in a neighbourhood of pastel-coloured shotgun houses, is now \"75% vouchers\", according to its principal and owner Cheryl Leufroy Frilot.</p> <p>She acknowledged that the religious setting is uncomfortable for some, but said her small class sizes and relaxed teaching style are attractive to many parents. The annual cost of tuition is around $6,000 for this academic year.</p> <p>Frilot said: \"It's a free place \u2013 they can come and be who they are. Its not robotic, not military-oriented.\"</p> <p>Many parents are drawn to the moral values she instils, Frilot said, as well as valuing her \"no-nonsense\" reputation. \"What they say is: if your child's having problems, take them to Miss Frilot.\"</p> <p>Religious education here takes the form of a Bible studies class rather than comparative faith, but science is never censored, Frilot said. \"We teach evolution, we teach reproduction. I'm not saying [religion] is the only way.\"</p> <p>Private schools that accept the vouchers must enter those students for the same standardised tests taken by public schools. If they fail to reach the bar set for state schools, they face removal from the programme.</p> <p>In Louisiana, the state sets clear limits on the marketplace. In the end, accountability to its testing regime trumps choice: the government will close a chronically underperforming public school even if parents continue to choose it.</p> <p>Neerav Kingsland, chief strategy officer of the not-for-profit group New Schools for New Orleans, likens it to licensing restaurants.</p> <p>\"If a restaurant is violating health codes, even if people want to go there, we're going to close the restaurant. If some schools are performing so bad on tests, even if parents want to got there it's a civic duty to close that option.\"</p> <p>Granting schools greater autonomy is regarded as vital to the health of the system. Freeing schools from central control \u2013 chiefly by setting up charters \u2013 has been a hallmark of education reform in the US, embraced by the leaders of both parties.</p> <p>With this freedom comes the latitude to tailor a bespoke approach to complex problems, White said.</p> <p>\"We have a school in the ninth ward where the principal has decided that he's going to serve breakfast, lunch and dinner to each child. He and I worked together in New York; we were joking about what would happen if we tried to do that in the New York City system.</p> <p>\"Not only would the teacher union say it was a violation of contract, but the food service would say: 'We don't do dinner'. Security would say: 'Yes, but we have to pay for the per diem', the electricity company would say: 'No, we shut school buildings down at this hour.' My point is that when you run systems on a basis where you have these monolithic contracts, they almost by their nature ignore the complexities of schools.\"</p> <p>In common with conservative education reforms across the US, New Orleans schools have come under increased competitive pressure while facing tight spending settlements.</p> <p>In particular, the Recovery School District \u2013 a group of underperforming Louisiana schools which have been taken over by the state government \u2013 is making \"significant cuts\" in expenditure, according to the Cowen Institute.</p> <p>Loup, of the Coalition for Louisiana Public Education, said: \"The money the state provides to our school system has not been increased in four years. That increase is what allows the school system to handle the increasing costs that we receive every year, for retirement, for healthcare, for the gas that goes on the bus. That's the biggest thing that's holding our school system back.</p> <p>\"Every time you take that money away, it's taking away programmes that help those who need it the most. It means the schools are not going to do well, they'll have lower scores, it makes us look like we're not doing our job.\"</p> <p>Even before Katrina, the quality of infrastructure in New Orleans was poor. Its roads, built on swampy ground and poorly maintained, are often bumpy and potholed. The officials behind its school reforms say one of their concerns is to deal with a gap the government can fix; the supply of skilled workers.</p> <p>Raising standards in schools means more jobs in sectors like oil and gas, a mainstay of the state's economy, can be filled by local people. Patrick Dobard, superintendent of the Recovery school district, said: \"As a state we have a number of chemical plants and what we're finding is that requirements in plant operators have changed dramatically over the last ten or 15 years, where you really need a couple of years of community college or two years of four-year college to perform at the level they need to have for workers, so there's a dire need in the industry to have higher performing workers.</p> <p>\"That's why we're trying to ensure we have strong technical education in our schools.\"</p> <p>The public school system in New Orleans remains skewed by race and income compared with the city it serves. In the academic year 2011-12, 90% of students in New Orleans public schools were African American and 85% were on free or reduced lunches, an indicator of poverty. The US census says 60% of the city population is black and 24% are classified as poor.</p> <h2>The US census says</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398427479\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/26/1351268827268/Clark-Prep-charter-school-008.jpg\" alt=\"Clark Prep charter school in New Orleans\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clark Prep: formerly a 'school of last resort'. Photograph: Julie Dermansky for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julie Dermansky/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>Meanwhile, those at the forefront of change are often white, prompting accusations that this is a reform imposed by outsiders. Since the charter school programme was accelerated in the wake of Katrina, the profile of school staff has changed; it has become whiter and younger. White, the state superintendent, acknowledges the change \u2013 around half of school leaders are now white, he says. He said: \"Its not far from the demographic of the city itself which has also changed. It's over a third white.\"</p> <p>The concentration of African American children in New Orleans schools dates back to desegregation; white flight created entirely black schools in the inner city, and largely white ones in the suburbs. Joseph S Clark prepatory school \u2013 better known as Clark Prep \u2013 was, before desegregation, a highly performing black school.</p> <p>But when it was taken over by charter operator FirstLine Schools, it had become a \"school of last resort,\" according to co-principal Alex Hochron.</p> <p>He said: \"The year before FirstLine took over in 2010, Clark was the lowest-performing high school in the whole of Louisiana. When we walked in here, spray-painted up one of the banisters was the word 'graveyard'. [We said] did someone do this because we're taking over the school? The response was: that's been up there for months.</p> <p>\"There was very little authority. There were fires being set in the bathrooms. I'm not saying the adults weren't working, but there wasn't a sense of consistency and support.\"</p> <p>The change in two years is evident to the students, who come up unprompted to tell outsiders of their pride in the school. One student, Henrietta London, said: \"This school used to be a mess; children were learning nothing. My mum sent me here because they're rebuilding the school and changing the culture.\"</p> <p>The school ran a poster campaign this year aimed at recruiting new parents. One poster showed faces from the class of 2012, highlighting how many had been accepted into college. Another featured a star student in his basketball gear, asking: \"What will be your legacy?\"</p> <p>Jay Altman, chief executive of FirstLine Schools, dismisses the idea that the competition for students discourages schools from sharing knowledge.</p> <p>\"Even though hospitals in this country are competing with each other and patients have relative choice, medicine has some of the best knowledge sharing in the world,\" he pointed out. \"Those of us who are trying to close the [education] achievement gap nationally, we share practices all the time.\"</p> <p>The future in Louisiana is one in which the competitive pressures will only get more intense. The state estimates that 380,000 schoolchildren, out of 700,000 statewide, are eligible for the voucher scheme. Charter schools, introduced in many other cities as competition to traditional public schools, are themselves facing the prospect of pupils being poached.</p> <p>The language of the marketplace pervades the conversation about schools here. When the architects of school reform in Louisiana speak about the public school system, it is reminiscent of a private equity firm casting a hawkish eye over a mediocre business they have just bought.</p> <p>White is uncompromising about the virtues of choice, even if that means weak schools being driven to the wall. \"I think competition is always to some degree destabilising to those who can't compete,\" he said. \"I have no problem with a school that is failing parents and kids being essentially destabilised because parents aren't choosing it.\"'</p>",
  "<p>China is the world's biggest market but for western media firms trying to expand it can be a bruising experience, with even the biggest names such as Rupert Murdoch and Google having come a cropper.</p> <p>So it was perhaps inevitable when the New York Times (NYT) decided to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/28/new-york-times-launches-chinese-website\" title=\"\">launch a Chinese language website in June</a> that it would at some point fall foul of the censors. But it did so in spectacular fashion on Friday when the government blocked access to the site, accusing it of trying to \"smear\" the country's name. Its crime was to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/26/new-york-times-china-wen-jiabao\" title=\"\">publish an article</a> claiming that the family of the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, had accumulated massive wealth \u2013 a handsome $2.7bn (\u00a31.67bn) \u2013 during his time in power.</p> <p>China swiftly blocked access to the paper's websites and censored searches for the NYT as well as the names of Wen's children and wife on China's main Twitter-like microblogging service, Weibo.</p> <p>A foreign ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, said the paper \"smears China's name and has ulterior motives\".</p> <p>The media group responded by saying it would \"ask the Chinese authorities to ensure that our readers in China can continue to enjoy New York Times journalism\".</p> <p>The NYT hired 30 staff for its Chinese website, most of whom are working as translators and editors, and publishes about 30 articles a day on national, foreign and arts topics, in addition to editorials. Two thirds of the content is translated from the paper and a third is written by Chinese editors and local freelance journalists.</p> <p>The US paper was unlikely to follow Google's initial approach when it launched in 2006 and censor its content but diplomacy would be needed to re-establish its service, said William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the Oxford Internet Institute.</p> <p>\"It will be impossible for China to stop people seeing this story even by censoring the site because there will be so much re-posting of the story from elsewhere. So I don't think censorship can be totally effective. This particular article will be more circulated and better known because of the censorship of the New York Times,\" said Dutton.</p> <p>He said the Chinese had become more effective at filtering stories but adopted a two-faced approach to criticism. \"It is OK for someone to protest in China, but not in Tiananmen Square; it is OK to criticise China, but not OK to criticise the prime minister. This is a symbolic reaction, more of a political stance.</p> <p>\"Strategically, how do the New York Times deal with it? Every publication has to figure out how they accommodate the law of the country they are in and if nobody loses their temper and takes time to figure out how and why this happened, then maybe they can figure out a way to climb down without losing face,\" said Dutton.</p> <p>Google found itself in a similar situation when it launched in China in 2006 with censored search results. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/23/google-china-firewall-censorship-internet?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">In the face of a barrage of criticism over censorship in 2010, it defied the authorities' warnings and started to redirect mainland Chinese users to its unrestricted Hong Kong website</a>.</p> <p>Rupert Murdoch also gave up his dream of piping Chinese TV to every home in the country. Over a period of almost 20 years, he travelled regularly to China and assiduously courted its leaders, in the hope of creating a truly global satellite network. But last August, News Corporation announced it was selling its controlling stakes in three of its Chinese television channels to a domestic private equity fund based in Beijing and Shanghai.</p> <p>The Financial Times and Murdoch's Wall Street Journal also run Chinese-language services, with the FT boasting 1.7 million users, and the New York Times will still be hoping to provide them with vigorous competition.</p>",
  "<p>The increasingly tense battle over the legal and political accountability of the security services has intensified with Ken Clarke, the minister without portfolio, accusing campaign organisations of describing his plans in hyperbolic terms that obfuscate the safeguards he is proposing.</p> <p>He has been accused of proposing secret courts in which civil claims of maltreatment by the security services would be heard.</p> <p>Clarke insists that under the justice and security bill, only judges, and not ministers, would decide if hearings should be held in private, and nothing currently heard in open court could be heard in closed court in future.</p> <p>He has written to the shadow justice secretary, Sadiq Khan, saying he was wrong to claim as he had a in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/21/secret-court-labour-letter-clegg\" title=\"\">letter to the Guardian </a>that \"ministers retain the power on what is kept secret\".</p> <p>The dispute over the bill, currently in the Lords, has become more fraught following the decision of the Liberal Democrat conference, against the advice of the party leadership, to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/25/secret-courts-lib-dem-conference\" title=\"\">vote overwhelmingly against the so-called secret courts</a>.</p> <p>Jo Shaw, the mover of the motion at the party conference, has now accused Liberal Democrat peers of apparently planning to ignore the conference decision, an issue that is leading to questions about the party's internal democracy, due to be raised at a meeting of the party's executive on Monday .</p> <p>The bill is due to return for its final stage in the Lords - its third reading - next month.</p> <p>Clarke in his letter to Khan, but also aimed at the Liberal Democrat debate, claimed misunderstandings had crept into the debate about what the bill would achieve.</p> <p>He wrote: \"The bill will ensure that in practice nothing currently heard in open court could be heard in closed court in future\".</p> <p>The bill arose after the government felt forced to abandon its defence against claims of torture made by Guant\u00e1namo Bay detainees. Clarke wrote that the cases were abandoned by the UK government because the \"defence against these claims rested extensively on national security sensitive evidence. There was no point spending years and potentially millions of pounds going through the motions of a full public interest immunity disclosure exercise. Any such exercise would have excluded crucial sections of the government's defence and been an exercise in banging your head against a brick wall\" - a phrase used by the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation David Anderson.</p> <p>Clarke said \"the serious problem we were left with was not that the intelligence officers would be forced to give secret evidence in public courts but that we were left with silence because the cases could not be heard\".</p> <p>He added: \"Reform will also help ensure that taxpayers money will not in future be paid to people who have not proved their case and who worse still may be dangerous simply because sensitive material exists that is relevant to the case which cannot be put before a court\".</p> <p>He also claimed that the judge would only permit national security material currently excluded from the courtroom to be heard in closed material procedure or a secret court if the interests of national security would be damaged if the relevant evidence was disclosed.</p> <p>Moreover, once the principle of a closed hearing was conceded by the judge, the secretary of state would have to apply to the judge for specific material to be heard in these closed proceedings.</p> <p>He argued that the judge could still order disclosure of material in full or part, or if the government elected not to make such disclosure, the judge could then order its exclusion from the courtroom and admissions to be made in its place.</p> <p>He concluded by saying he was convinced that \"the test of time will prove me right \u2026 that the justice and security bill will increase, not reduce, the accountability of the security and intelligence agencies\".</p> <p>In an earlier letter to the deputy prime minister in September, published in the Guardian, Khan wrote: \"This is not the judge-led process that Ken Clarke has claimed (\u2026) meaning the usual checks and balances that provide proper scrutiny of government action will not be present.\"</p>",

Both houses, the fictional and the real, dated from the early 19th century, but while the first was south of the Thames, the second lay&#xa0;north of the Forth.</p> <p>A firm of solicitors with a name like&#xa0;Macbeth, Macduff &amp; Duncan had advertised it in the local paper, in the days when ads for houses included neither a picture nor a price and were placed discreetly among other used items for sale such as prams and garden sheds. This was the case in Scotland, anyway, where in the 1960s about two in three households, including ours, lived in homes built by and rented from the local authority. No country west of Poland had a higher proportion of public housing, it was said, which meant private property and how one went about acquiring it was never a conversational topic among the people we knew. Looking back, and counting on my fingers, I reckon I had seen the inside of no more than four or five owner-occupied houses, including the dentist's, by the time I left school.</p> <p>The first thing, obviously, was to get&#xa0;in touch with Banquo, Macduff &amp; Macbeth, so I went to the call box at the end of the street and inserted my four pennies when the operator asked. The disdaining female voice at the solicitors clearly felt insulted that the majesty of house purchase was being approached with so little decorum, but she told me the price (somewhere about \u00a31,000) before announcing carelessly that she believed the house had been sold. And so it had, to a glamorous woman we knew who kept the cafe on the ferryboat pier. My parents took the news well, listing all the things that would have made them unhappy had they bought the house (mornings spent wrapped in sea mist, the probability of damp) and consoling themselves with the thought that their \u00a33,000 was still intact. By the time it was spent on voyages to Egypt and the Soviet Union, countries that for different reasons my father was keen to see, the brief flirtation with the prospect of home ownership had been forgotten. The rent to the county council went on being paid. None of us felt that a life-enhancing chance had been missed.</p> <p>The passion for home ownership that has developed in the half-century since must rank among the biggest changes in Britain's social and economic history. On a national scale, the effects include an unprecedented boom and bust in house prices, world-beating figures for household debt, and the diversion of capital from more useful purposes such as industry. At a more personal level, it means some of us own not one house but two, a luxury that 50 years ago would have seemed limited (though it probably wasn't so, in fact) to a few plutocrats with townhouses in Mayfair and shooting estates in Inverness. According to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/22/cornwall-revealed-second-homes-hotspot\" title=\"\">a report in the Guardian this week</a>, 2.3 million people in England and Wales can now lay claim to second homes, which is both strictly true and rather misleading. The 2.3 million is the number of people who, according to new data published by the Office for National Statistics, have a second address they use for more than 30 days a year. Most of them are students or the children of separated parents; the number of people in England and Wales who have second homes in the sense we usually understand the term \u2013 as holiday homes \u2013 is 165,000, which is less than 1% of the 23.4 million households in the two countries.</p> <p>Rich people, then, whose appetite for&#xa0;holiday homes has driven up prices, particularly in Cornwall and parts of Wales where young people who work there find they can no longer afford to live; Aran Jones, the leader of pressure group Cymuned, quoted in the Guardian report, spoke of \"societal breakdown\". As we have a second home, I of course feel defensive and can produce my little defensive lists. Why do we have it? Because neither my wife nor I has a decent pension beyond the state's, and 10 years ago property looked like a good way to protect our savings. Because we had children and it&#xa0;was beside the sea. Because it was cheap. Because a friend said that its situation under a wooded cliff reminded her of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/oct/18/hotels-india-shimla\" title=\"\">Shimla</a>. Because we thought we might move there for good. Because it connected me to my childhood in ways I&#xa0;thought meaningful.</p> <p>But the guilt is largely unnecessary. The island of Bute, where the house is, has the opposite problems to Cornwall. Nobody is flocking there now, though they did throughout most of the 19th century and well into the 20th. Its Victorian economy was partly founded on second homes; our house was built in a bigger house's back garden in the 1870s as summer overspill accommodation, so the tenants we displace aren't fishermen or care workers but the ghosts of visitors like ourselves. If anything, there aren't enough of us part-timers. House prices go down and newly converted flats stay unsold, while every month another shop or B&amp;B closes.</p> <p>We do our best. We take the local buses when they run and taxis when they don't, use local tradesmen, shop at the greengrocer, fishmongers, butchers, bakery and hardware store. To the permanent population we may seem sentimental, stupid in our opposition to the growing tide of islanders who take the car ferry to the mainland for their fortnightly shop at Scotland's largest Tesco. (There is more than one way to achieve \"societal breakdown\".)</p> <p>Still, I like our house, despite the fact its suggestion of an Indian hill station is invisible to most other eyes, and despite the damp in the cellar. I don't think our ownership of it has disadvantaged anyone other than possibly ourselves, depending on whether and how much it declines in value. When we decide to sell it, as we inevitably shall, I shall think of the moment when Dad won the pools and it occurred to me that interesting houses needn't always belong to someone else: that people like us could&#xa0;buy them if we had the money \u2013 or&#xa0;could borrow it. That notion changed everything, not always for the better.</p>",
  "<p>There's something about Santi Cazorla. He has a strange effect on people. Mention him and there it is: the wide eyes, the enthusiasm, the enjoyment, the sense of discovery, the fun. From Ruud van Nistelrooy escaping the sun at M\u00e1laga's training ground and offering a judgment of unsolicited simplicity, to Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez citing him as the embodiment of a footballing manifesto that has conquered all, there is something about him that brings out the fan in footballers. And in football managers.</p> <p>\"What a player Santi is,\" said Van Nistelrooy puffing out his cheeks early last season, just weeks after becoming his team-mate for the first time. Xavi, signalling his chest, said: \"Have you seen Santi Cazorla? You think I'm small? He's up to here on me and he's brilliant.\" Neither man was asked to talk about Cazorla; both men, team-mates of his, chose to. As for Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, he called on every kid in the country to watch Cazorla play. And it was not just what he said that stood out as the way he said it. The look on his face.</p> <p>Every time Arsenal's manager has mentioned Cazorla since he signed from M\u00e1laga for \u20ac15m (\u00a312m) there has been a childlike quality to his response. A giggling guilt: how did we get him? And for that price? A price that M\u00e1laga's coach, Manuel Pellegrini, this week called \"an unthinkable gift\". M\u00e1laga's financial crisis provides part of the answer; the passivity of other clubs, though, remains a mystery because, however much Cazorla is touted as an unknown revelation, he is nothing of the sort.</p> <p>The surprise is not that he is playing well \u2013 former team-mates say that they never had any doubts \u2013 but that, at 27, it has taken this long for him to be universally recognised. So far this season he has created more chances from open play than anyone else in England. It is not new: last season he created 82 goalscoring chances; only behind Lionel Messi, Mesut Ozil and Jes\u00fas Navas. The year before that, Opta put together a statistics-driven perfect XI of La Liga players: Cazorla and Juan Mata were the only non-Madrid or Barcelona players in it.</p> <p>\"When we signed him last summer, he symbolised us crossing from a good team to a great one. He is a player who plays and makes others play, supremely gifted. An artist,\" says the former M\u00e1laga sporting director Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez, whose job it was, fleetingly, to lead the first big money project in the country.</p> <p>Fifty caps for Spain \u2013 <em>this Spain</em> \u2013 say much, and Cazorla played a key role in winning Euro 2008, but he missed the 2010 World Cup through injury. The inevitable question runs: if he is so good, why did Madrid or Barcelona never sign him? The short answer is: they are Real Madrid and Barcelona. And Madrid tried. Twice.</p> <p>In 2008 Cazorla was caught by TV cameras talking on the phone to Iker Casillas about his imminent move to Madrid, but Villarreal moved to block the transfer. And this week Pellegrini, his coach at first Villarreal and then M\u00e1laga, told Gazetta dello Sport that he had tried to sign him for Madrid the following season.</p> <p>\"He has the talent to play for either of those two but when the situation arose, Villarreal made an effort to keep him and he wanted to show his gratitude to them after all they had done,\" explains Carlos Marchena, a team-mate with Villarreal and Spain.</p> <p>\"I could never understand why Madrid or Barcelona never signed him,\" says Marcelino Garc\u00eda Toral, his coach at Recreativo de Huelva. \"It is hard to explain and it also makes me a bit sad. I think it's a real pity for the Spanish league.\"</p> <p>Those who knew Cazorla knew. \"Anyone who has played with him knew that everyone in England would fall in love with him,\" Marchena says. Joan Capdevila, Cazorla's room mate at Villarreal, adds: \"He does things you've never seen. You want to know how good Santi is? <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ack6SJG5ThM&amp;feature=youtu.be\" title=\"\">Type 'Cazorla, Seitaridis' into YouTube</a>.\"</p> <p>The video is almost six years old, from the time that Cazorla spent at Recreativo de Huelva aged 21 to 22, a single-season hiatus in his seven years at Villarreal. In it, he flicks the ball from one foot to the other and through the legs of the Greek defender. It happens so fast you have to watch it again to appreciate the skill. And the problem, Capdevila says, is that few even watched it the first time: \"If he had done that in the Champions League it would have gone round the world.\"</p> <p>The technique is natural. Watch the Spanish national team do piggy-in-the-middle drills and you can see it. The ball whizzes round so fast, so precisely, that even very good players, world champions, can be made to look average. Cazorla is emphatically not one of them. Sit close and the speed can be dizzying. Cazorla barely flinches. Pass, pass, pass, right foot, left. \"I played with him for five years and I still don't know if he is right footed or left footed, even from corners and free-kicks: it's insane,\" Capdevila says.</p> <p>Marcos L\u00f3pez is a coach in Oviedo who remembers being struck by an eight-year-old playing five-a-side <em>futbol sala</em> for a team called Covadonga. A team of kids from the neighbourhood, they were in the same division as clubs with long histories like Astur, Sporting Gijon, Real Oviedo and Estadio, where Juan Mata would later play. Still they won their group. \"By the end of the season they could easily have scored 300 and conceded 20,\" L\u00f3pez says. \"Santi was very, very small but he was dynamic, could dribble and controlled games. He left everyone open mouthed.\"</p> <p>Real Oviedo picked him up. Among his coaches was Luis S\u00e1nchez. \"Santi stood out immediately, not least because he was tiny,\" he says. \"These days everyone plays on Astroturf but back then all the pitches were muddy and he looked so small. But although there were inevitable question marks I never feared that size was going to be a problem. He could already kick a ball wonderfully with both feet, technically he was miles better than everyone else: he was prodigious. He could go past you on either side, and he was the top scorer by miles. He was dynamic, different. His talent is innate. And besides, he got stronger: he looks little now, but he is tough.\"</p> <p>From Oviedo, Cazorla joined Villarreal at 15. But it was the year at Recreativo that made him. \"You could see even then that he had all the qualities to be world class,\" says Javi Guerrero, who played with Cazorla there. \"He was absolutely clear about where he wanted to go and we knew he would get there. He was two footed, even taking corners from both sides and both feet, swinging in or swinging out. I remember being impressed by that but what was most striking was how daring he was for a player so young.\"</p> <p>The word Guerrero uses is <em>desparpajo.</em> It's a word many employ to describe Cazorla, one that could almost be translated as cheek. And watching the video Capdevila recommends, it is easy to see why. Yet there is also something eminently sensible and calm about his game. <em>Listo</em>, smart, is another recurring word. He controls the pace, the fluidity. In fact, Marcos Senna sees him as a potential long-term replacement for Xavi in the Spain team.</p> <p>Recreativo's manager Marcelino says: \"I had first seen him as a kid playing in Asturias but I'd lost track of him. When Recre signed him, we quickly realised that he was special. He was extremely clever.\" \"He reads the game so well,\" says Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez. \"His movement with and without the ball is exceptional and his always takes the right decision. He improves those around him, playing for them not just himself.\"</p> <p>\"Santi is always available: he never, ever hides,\" says Capdevila. \"He is a real leader. Not in the sense of shouting at people: he is not aggressive, he doesn't confront the referee, but he is a winner. He's extremely stubborn and very determined. Even off the pitch: even when we play cards or on the PlayStation, he always wants to win.\" Capdevila talks from experience: Cazorla jokes that the \"one time\" Capdevila beat him, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/nov/11/santi-cazorla-small-talk-interview\" title=\"\">he took a photo of the screen as proof to show his team-mates </a>.</p> <p>\"I have watched him closely on the pitch for a long time and one of the things I don't think people see is that capacity to suffer, to read the game and know how to adapt: when to be practical, when to be expansive,\" Marchena says. \"He is also always there for you, in all games, injured or not. His commitment, for someone so talented, is extremely unusual. For weaker players, sure. But not for someone like him.\"</p> <p>\"Players who think they have got it all tend to stagnate but Santi was never like that,\" Marcelino says. \"He was straightforward, noble, very mature, humble. You didn't have to tell him much but when you did he listened and took it all on board. One of his greatest virtues was that he loves football. He watched every game, he was humble, he listened, and he wanted to win. He was a <em>f\u00fatbolista futbolero.\"</em></p> <p>Guerrero explains that description: \"He watched every game, read everything he could. He really lived the game.\" Friends recall him as a 10-year-old playing his own games before heading off to watch his brother play, a football always at his feet. \"With Santi it was football, football, football,\" Luis S\u00e1nchez says. \"He has changed a bit though. Back then he hardly talked. I still see him occasionally and now he is a joker.\"</p> <p>Cazorla's smile is part of his charm. \"He tells the worst jokes ever,\" says Capdevila and Capdevila knows a thing about telling rubbish jokes. \"His are worse \u2013 and he doesn't even know how to tell them properly. I laughed every single day with him.\" Marchena says: \"He is a great team-mate, good in the dressing room: he never has a bad word for anyone, he is always smiling, always willing to help you out.\" To put that in sporting director terms, M\u00e1laga's Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez says: \"He creates an environment conducive to success.\" The text message response from one player responding to a request to talk about Cazorla sums it up: \"For Santi, anything.\"</p> <p>When Cazorla left Villarreal, Senna said he felt like the team had cut off a finger. They had qualified for the Champions League in his last season; in their first without him, they went down. Senna explains: \"When Santi left, it left a huge hole. Both on the pitch and off it. If he had been there I am sure we would not have gone down. He is a player who never loses the ball. He's so complete: he knows when to pause, when to accelerate; he imposed a style and dynamism on the team. He interprets the game so well. And without him, we lost our identity, our way of playing.\"</p> <p>Marchena agrees: \"His departure was one of the main reasons that we struggled.\"</p> <p>While Villarreal went down, Cazorla's new club, M\u00e1laga qualified for the Champions League for the first time in their history. And, when financial crisis hit, he left them too. Wenger was ready to take advantage. The perfect player, perfectly suited to his new environment.</p> <p>Fern\u00e1ndez says: \"The other thing to take into account is that his style is perfect for Arsenal. He suits a team that wants to have the ball; he facilitates that approach.\" Senna says: \"If it had been any other club, I am sure his adaptation would have taken longer but Arsenal play his way, similar to Spanish teams, so I am not remotely surprised that he has been so successful.\"</p> <p>Wenger's definition sums it up: it is not just about creativity but about control. \"He opens defences with the quality of his passing and he gives us a technical security that allows us to escape when we are under pressure. He can make us stronger and more efficient,\" Wenger says. There is, Capdevila says, just one problem: the language. \"I want to see his first interview in English. Now, that is going to be a video worth watching.\"</p>",
  "<p>The UN could strip Britain's statutory human rights body of its \"A-list\" status because of deep cuts by the coalition government, leaked documents disclose.</p> <p>Letters between the home secretary, Theresa May, and senior UN officials show she has been warned that the Equality and Human Rights Commission would lose its financial autonomy \u2013 and consequently its UN rating \u2013 if cuts to its budget continued. This would mean the UK could no longer engage fully in the UN human rights council or work within the international co-ordinating committee. Countries with human rights organisations on the A-list include nearly all western European nations as well as Azerbaijan and Indonesia.</p> <p>Those with \"B-list\" status include Kazakhstan, Sri Lanka and Congo-Brazzaville.</p> <p>Any change in status within the UN would be deeply troubling to some senior Liberal Democrats who have voiced concerns over the way their coalition partners have slashed costs and undermined the influence of the commission. Last week, a bill passed through the Commons that will remove some of the commission's general duties including a commitment to support human rights and tackle discrimination.</p> <p>In a letter sent on 28 June, the UN commissioner on human rights, Navanethem Pillay, warned May that the government's proposals should be reassessed because cuts threaten the independence of the body.</p> <p>\"I would like to call on your government to review some of the proposals with a view to preserving EHRC's independence and to ensuring its continued compliance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions,\" she said.</p> <p>She went on the refer to the rules overseeing the commission's \"A\" rating and pointed out that Britain's statutory human rights body must retain financial autonomy.</p> <p>If May was in any doubt over concerns within the UN, Dr Mousa Burayzat, chair of the international co-ordinating committee (ICC), sent her a second letter on 16 July, warning that the cuts raised serious concerns.</p> <p>\"While, if considered alone, the proposed legislative changes may not negatively impact on the Commission's 'A' accreditation, taken as a whole the package or proposals clearly constitutes a diminution of the EHRC's role and responsibilities.</p> <p>\"Whether this amounts to a threat to the A accreditation is a matter that only the ICC's sub-committee on accreditation can authoritatively advise following a systematic review,\" he said.</p> <p>Burayzat, whose committee co-ordinates human rights organisations from across the world with support from the UN, criticised the government's decision to reduce the chairmanship from a full-time job to the equivalent of two days a week.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/18/lady-oneill-equality-commission-chair\" title=\"\">commission has appointed Lady O'Neill as a part-time</a> chairman to replace Trevor Phillips, whose term ended last month. May defended her decisions in a letter to Pillay. She blamed the commission for not keeping within its budget and said that its accounts had been questioned by the National Audit Office. She claimed the cuts were part of general government policy to reduce spending and insisted they had not compromised the commission's independence. She said the new chair will be a \"strong and experienced leader\" who will \"have knowledge or experience of discrimination or human rights.\"</p> <p>May's letter did not address the case for strengthening its independence or the need for stronger legislation to underpin this, nor propose any changes to the proposed cuts.</p> <p>The coalition has set the commission a budget of \u00a326.8m for 2014-15, a 62% cut to its 2007 budget of \u00a370m. Insiders fear that the budget is likely to be cut to \u00a318m.</p> <p>Commenting on the letters, Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, called for the government to drop plans to weaken the commission before they go before the House of Lords. \"The United Nations writing to ministers to raise concerns over the potential downgrading of the EHRC is a very serious matter and should ring alarm bells for a government which has been accused of abolishing the EHRC by stealth by its own supporters,\" he said.</p> <p>Institutions accredited by the UN with \"A-list\" status enjoy much greater access to UN human rights treaty bodies and other organs.</p> <p>They can participate fully in the international and regional work and meetings of national institutions, as voting members. They are also able to participate in sessions of the Human Rights Council and take the floor under any agenda item, submit documentation and take up separate seating.</p> <p>If reduced to \"B\" status, they participate as observers. They may not take the floor under agenda items or submit documentation to the Human Rights Council.</p> <p>Oversight of the commission has been moved from the Home Office to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. A DCMS spokeswoman said the government was reforming the commission because it had struggled to deliver across its wide remit, and hoped to retain its A rating. \"That is why we are implementing a package of reforms to focus the EHRC on its core role as Great Britain's independent equality body and A-rated national human rights institution. Improvements have already been made,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>The European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, expressed her concern for the jailed Iranian lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh as she received the European parliament's most prestigious human rights award.</p> <p>Sotoudeh and an acclaimed Iranian film director, Jafar Panahi, were on Friday awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, previously won by the likes of Aung San Suu Kyi and Nelson Mandela. The prize is named after the Soviet physicist and outspoken dissident Andrei Sakharov.</p> <p>Sotoudeh fell foul of the Iranian authorities for representing political activists and is serving a six-year prison term in Tehran's notorious Evin prison. She is on day 10 of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/24/iran-urged-release-nasrin-sotoudeh\" title=\"\">a hunger strike in protest at the state's harassment of her family </a>and is reported to have been taken to the prison's medical facility as her health deteriorated.</p> <p>\"I am following the case of Nasrin Sotoudeh and other human rights defenders with great concern,\" Ashton told the Guardian.\" We will continue to campaign for the charges against them to be dropped. We look to Iran to respect the human rights obligations it has signed up to.\"</p> <p>For the Sakharov prize, Sotoudeh and Panahi were up against the anti-Kremlin punk band Pussy Riot and Belarusian jailed political activist Ales Bialiatski. \"The award \u2026 is a message of solidarity and recognition to a woman and a man who have not been bowed by fear and intimidation and who have decided to put the fate of their country before their own,\" said Martin Schulz, the president of the European parliament.</p> <p>Panahi, a supporter of Iran's opposition green movement, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/20/iran-jails-jafar-panahi-films\" title=\"\">was sentenced in 2010 to six years in prison and a 20-year ban </a>on directing and producing films as well as travelling abroad. Unlike Sotoudeh, who is still in jail, Panahi was temporarily released after widespread condemnation of his conviction and a series of hunger strikes, but he risks arrest at any time.</p> <p>Amnesty International said fears were growing for Sotoudeh's state of health. \"For three months now Nasrin Sotoudeh has only had visits from her children while behind a glass screen \u2013 ever since the authorities discovered she had been using a tissue to write her defence for an upcoming court hearing,\" said Amnesty's deputy director for Middle East and North Africa programme, Ann Harrison.</p> <p>\"The Iranian authorities have imposed a travel ban on her daughter and on one occasion held her husband overnight in prison for their peaceful advocacy on her behalf.\"</p> <p>The UK's foreign secretary, William Hague, on Wednesday echoed Ashton's remarks about Sotoudeh and called on Iran to reconsider her \"outrageous\" and \"deplorable\" detention.</p> <p>\"I know that you require water, food, housing, a family, parents, love, and visits with your mother,\" Sotoudeh reportedly wrote to her children in a letter from jail after being denied to meet with them because of refusing to wear a chador, the full-length cloak worn by Iranian women. \"However, just as much, you need freedom, social security, the rule of law and justice.\"</p> <p>Karim Lahidji, the president of the Iranian League for the Defence of Human Rights, described the EU's decision to honour Sotoudeh and Panahi as a \"great victory\" for all rights defenders in the country.</p> <p>\"We are extremely worried about Nasrin's health which is rapidly deteriorating after 10 days of hunger strike,\" he said. \"We therefore urge Iranian authorities to release her and immediately stop subjecting her to arbitrary and punitive conditions of detention.\"</p>",
  "<p>Police in Belgium are searching for a gunman and accomplice who killed a British oil executive on the streets of Brussels.</p> <p>Nicholas Mockford, 60, was shot dead as he left a restaurant with his wife, Mary, nearly two weeks ago but details of the killing have only just emerged.</p> <p>Mockford's employer, ExxonMobil, on Friday said his death was not linked to his work.</p> <p>Belgian detectives have appealed for witnesses to the shooting. Police said two attackers wearing crash helmets tried to grab Mary Mockford's handbag, and then slapped her in the face during the attack. They said four shots were then fired at Mockford.</p> <p>One witness told Belgian television he twice tried to resuscitate the victim before an ambulance arrived. \"I heard a noise, 'tack tack', I thought that was bizarre and went outside to look,\" he told Flemish television channel, VTM.</p> <p>\"There was a woman lying on the floor on the pavement on the other side of the road. She was crying 'help, help'. There was also a man lying on the street, next to a car. [The] woman shouts out it was a white van.\"</p> <p>Initially witnesses believed Mockford had been run over by the van outside the restaurant in northern Brussels.</p> <p>\"Suddenly he stopped breathing,\" said the witness, who lived next door to the restaurant Da Marcello where the attack took place. \"I resuscitated him, he regained consciousness and then he became unconscious again. I resuscitated him a second time and then the ambulance arrived. Only then did neighbours realise the man had been shot.\"</p> <p>He said Mockford had what appeared to be bullet wounds to his chest and shoulder and he also saw blood on his head. Police found four bullet cases outside the restaurant.</p> <p>Detectives initially worked on the theory that the killing on 14 October might have been an attempted carjacking, because witnesses saw the couple walking across the street to their 4x4 vehicle before the attack.</p> <p>One Belgian officer was reported as saying the attack was a \"very strange case\" which had been passed to federal investigators.</p> <p>Exxon Mobil refused to answer questions about the case. It released a statement which said the killing had nothing to do with his work.</p> <p>\"We were shocked by the tragic death of Nick Mockford, one of our employees a fortnight ago in Brussels. Mr Mockford was a department manager at our office close to Brussels, but we have no indication the incident was work-related.</p> <p>\"Our thoughts are with his family, friends and colleagues and we are supporting them as best we can at this very difficult time,\" the company said.</p> <p>The victim was reported to have been born in Leicestershire but had been living for a number of years in Belgium and Singapore. He is believed to have worked for ExxonMobil since the 1970s and was head of marketing for interim technologies for ExxonMobil Chemicals, Europe, promoting new types of greener fuel.</p> <p>He and his wife, who is Belgian, had been married for 15 years. His three adult children from his first marriage live in Britain, according to reports.</p> <p>The Foreign Office is providing consular assistance to his family.</p> <p>The investigating judge imposed an order on police preventing them from releasing any detail on the case, which police said was not unusual in a serious murder case. As a result, initial news reports were sparse. But on Thursday, authorities switched course and decided to enlist the public's help, releasing a brief description of the crime.</p>",
  "<p>An unhappy week for Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, marked by defeats away at Norwich and at home to Schalke, and seasoned by a difficult club AGM. On the face of it, QPR look like ideal convalescent opposition: bottom of the league, with a manager under pressure, and unsettled both by recent team-building efforts and the unresolved background chunter of Anton Ferdinand's involvement in the John Terry affair. On the other hand, they are something of a bogey team, statistically Arsenal's least favoured opponents in the Premier League alongside Manchester United. Wenger could give Jack Wilshere his first top-flight appearance in 18 months and Bacary Sagna may also be back in the squad. <strong>Barney Ronay</strong></p> <p><strong>Venue</strong> Emirates Stadium, Saturday 3pm</p> <p><strong>Tickets </strong>Sold out</p> <p><strong>Last season </strong>Arsenal 1 QPR 0</p> <p><strong>Referee </strong>Anthony Taylor</p> <p><strong>This season's matches</strong> 6 <strong>Y</strong>10, <strong>R</strong>1, 1.83 cards per game</p> <p><strong>Odds </strong>Arsenal 2-5 QPR 8-1 Draw 9-2</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398427323\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/10/26/1351274914020/Arsenal-v-Queens-Park-Ran-001.jpg\" alt=\"Arsenal v Queens Park Rangers\" width=\"460\" height=\"650\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arsenal v Queens Park Rangers: Probable starters in bold, contenders in light.

  "<p>The newspaper industry could have the toughest system of press self-regulation in the free world established within three months of approval, Lord Black, chairman of the Press Standards Board of Finance, has said.</p> <p>A state-regulated system could take up to three years to establish, and possibly longer because of the threat of a legal challenge to some form of statutory based system, he said.</p> <p>Black is also executive director of the Telegraph Media Group and central to the campaign mounted by many newspapers to head off regulation before publication of the Leveson inquiry report.</p> <p>It is the first time that the newspaper industry has suggested that it could put a new system of press regulation in place so quickly, a spokesman for the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) said on Friday. In a sign of some newspapers' determination to oppose any form of regulation, even as a backstop, Lord Black told peers on Thursday that there was a \"binary choice. There is no easy middle way\".</p> <p>Senior Conservatives believe Leveson could propose much stronger, independent regulation answerable in some form to Ofcom, the current broadcasting regulator.</p> <p>With the support of much of the newspaper industry, the PCC chair, Lord Hunt, has proposed a new system of regulation legally underpinned through enforceable commercial contracts.</p> <p>\"Each publisher would be required to sign a contract with the regulator which will be enforceable through the civil law.</p> <p>\"The contract would bind publications into the system and equip the new regulator with powers of enforcement, effectively compelling co-operation with the regulator by enabling it to sue for any contractual breaches,\" he said.</p> <p>Black spoke of fines of up to \u00a31m. His intervention is part of a growing propaganda war between newspapers, broadly allied with key Conservative figures \u2013 although not at present the prime minister \u2013 on the one hand, and Labour and the Liberal Democrats on the other. Both sides have spawned campaign organisations \u2013 <a href=\"http://hackinginquiry.org/\" title=\"\">Hacked Off</a>, which makes the case for statutory underpinning, and the <a href=\"http://www.freespeechnetwork.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Free Speech Network</a>, which is opposed.</p> <p>A Channel 4 camerawoman accompanying Hugh Grant was refused entrance to the Free Speech Network launch. Another camera crew was already filming the event.</p> <p>In a sign of the tensions within the coalition over the issue, Lord Razzall speaking for the Liberal Democrats strongly backed statutory underpinning. He said: \"There is a very clear distinction between a statute that allows political interference in what newspapers want to publish and an entirely independent body established in law that holds powerful press interests to account for implementing their own codes of conduct.\"</p> <p>He said it was perfectly possible \"to establish an independent backstop regulator with powers carefully prescribed in law which does not interfere with content but simply ensures the self-regulated keep their own promises\".</p> <p>He added that no politician could be allowed on any backstop body on media matters. It is understood his position matches that of Nick Clegg.</p> <p>Viscount Younger of Leckie speaking for the government said he noted Lord Black's remarks about the slippery slope of state intervention. But he added: \"I think it is helpful to be clear that regulating process may not be the same as regulating content if it came to a form of statutory underpinning.\"</p> <p>A second Liberal Democrat peer, Lord Stoneham, also insisted that all newspaper companies and bloggers would have to sign up to a new editors' code. \"We cannot have companies simply dropping out \u2026 when they dislike a particular system'\" he said.</p> <p>He suggested a range of incentives or penalties to encourage newspapers to join the system of regulation, including better protection in the courts for defamation and public interest cases, cheaper insurance and even tax incentives.</p>",
  "<p>So many stories of employers pressuring their workers to vote for Romney have come out that you might think workplace intimidation was invented just for this election.</p> <p>Romney certainly hasn't done much to dispel this perception. In a conference call to the National Federation of Independent Business, the GOP candidate was <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/10/romney-told-employers-tell-employees-whom-vote/58076/\">recorded encouraging business owners</a> to:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[M]ake it very clear to your employees what you believe is in the best interest of your enterprise and therefore their job and their future in the upcoming elections.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>A number of Romney backers took it upon themselves to spell out more clearly to their workers what \"the best interest for their job\" really means. David Siegel, CEO of Florida's Westgate Resorts, <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5950189/the-ceo-who-built-himself-americas-largest-house-just-threatened-to-fire-his-employees-if-obamas-elected\">emailed</a> his employees that a second term for Obama would likely give him \"no choice but to reduce the size of this company\". Republican donor-activists Charles and David Koch were no less subtle when they sent 45,000 employees of their Georgia Pacific paper company a list of whom to vote for, warning that workers \"<a href=\"http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/14017/koch_industries_sends_45000_employees_pro_romney_mailing\">may suffer the consequences</a>\" if Obama is re-elected.</p> <p>Florida-based ASG Software CEO Arthur Allen informed his employees that he was contemplating a merger that would eliminate \"<a href=\"http://tv.msnbc.com/2012/10/14/exclusive-ceo-suggests-employees-jobs-may-be-at-stake-if-romney-doesnt-win/\">60% of the salaries</a>\" of the company \u2013 should Romney lose. In Ohio, coal mine owner Robert Murray <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/108140/coal-miners-donor-mitt-romney-benefactor\">left employees in no doubt that they were expected to attend a Romney rally</a> \u2013 off the clock and without pay. In Cuba, at least they pay workers for show demonstrations.</p> <p>Democrats are apoplectic. But as Romney assured those who have the power to hire and fire thousands of people, there is \"nothing illegal about you talking to your employees about what you believe is best for the business\". He's right. Heavy-handed? Yes. An abuse of authority? Probably. Against the law? Not likely.</p> <p>News outlets, on the other hand, are merely confused.</p> <p>\"Can your boss really tell you who to vote for?\" <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/10/can-your-boss-threaten-to-fire-you-if-you-dont-vote-for-romney/263709/\">asked</a> the Atlantic incredulously, before concluding the answer is \"probably yes\". Should this be a surprise? Seeing that your boss can legally tell you to do nearly anything else, down to what you may wear, when you may eat and how often you may go to the bathroom (and, if he wishes, demand samples when you do), the question comes across as a little na\u00efve. So, too, is the <a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/elections/campaign-trail/you-can-get-fired-talking-politics-work\">corollary</a> \"Can you be fired for expressing political views at work?\" Again, the answer is probably yes, which should only be a shock to anyone who has never held a job in an American private-sector workplace.</p> <p>In truth, as an \"at-will\" (that is, non-union) employee, you can be fired for much less. In Arizona, you can be fired for <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/ariz-birth-control-bill-lets-employers-fire-women-pill-based-religious-views-425530\">using birth control</a>. If you live in any one of 29 states, you can be fired for <a href=\"http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/5-people-who-were-fired-for-being-gay-and-the-29-states-where-that-is-still-legal/\">being gay</a>. You can be fired for <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/expresident/really-weird-reasons-for-getting-fired\">being a fan of the Green Bay Packers</a> if your boss roots for the Bears.</p> <p>Lest you think employer authority ends when you clock out, only four states \u2013 California, Colorado, New York and North Dakota \u2013 protect workers from being fired for legal activity <em>outside of work</em>. For the rest, workers can and <a href=\"http://crookedtimber.org/2012/07/01/let-it-bleed-libertarianism-and-the-workplace/\">have been fired for anything</a> from smoking to cross-dressing, all in the privacy of their homes. The growing practice of employers demanding job applicants to <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2122404/House-kills-plan-block-employers-demanding-Facebook-passwords-job-applicants.html\">hand over their Facebook passwords</a> underscores the blurring of the work-life divide in this information age.</p> <p>But free speech and voting rights are supposed to be more sacrosanct than the integrity of your Facebook account, so one would expect there to be greater political safeguards at work than there actually are. This is not to say they don't exist. Federal law makes it illegal to \"intimidate, threaten or coerce\" anyone against voting as they wish. But as Siegel, Allen and the Koch brothers have shown, the distinction between possible coercion or intimidation and \"worker education\" is rather fuzzy in the eyes of the law.</p> <p>Rather, the federal government largely punted questions of employee free speech to states, a legacy of federalism that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws\">hasn't had the best track record</a> when it comes to voting rights. In a state-by-state breakdown, UCLA law professor <a href=\"http://www.trolp.org/main_pgs/issues/v16n2/Volokh.pdf\">Eugene Volokh</a> finds such laws vary widely. About half of Americans live in states that provide some worker protection for political speech or from pressure to vote a certain way, such as threat of job loss. Florida is not one of them. Ohio bars employers from forcing workers to sign a petition, but not from <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/08/ohio-miners-required-attend-romney-rally\">standing in front of cameras</a> next to a \"Coal Country Stands With Mitt\" banner.</p> <p>Of course, what's on the books is one matter; enforcement is another. Even if you are lucky enough to live in New Mexico and have a signed letter saying you were fired for your Obama tote bag, it typically takes litigation to get your job back. And many people don't have the time or money to go through a court battle, even if the law is on their side.</p> <p>If anything is happening on the legal end, things are getting worse. The 2010 US supreme court Citizens United case greatly expanded the parameters of what is considered \"employer free speech\". Most famously, the decision lifted restrictions on corporate campaign spending and gave rise to Super Pacs. But the broader implications are unclear. If Citizens United gives companies free rein to mobilize their resources politically as they wish, one former FEC official <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/issues/58_32/Workplace-Intimidation-Becomes-Murky-Post-Citizens-United-Era-218456-1.html\">suggests</a> that employees could be considered resources which companies may mobilize.</p> <p>This is why the recent political turn of employee intimidation isn't an anomaly. It's an election year manifestation \u2013 aided by the supreme court \u2013 of fundamental power imbalances that exist in most workplaces. Brooklyn College political scientist Corey Robin sees a historical pattern: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"During the McCarthy years, the state outsourced the most significant forms of coercion and repression to the workplace. Fewer than 200 people went to jail for their political beliefs, but two out of every five American workers was investigated or subject to surveillance. </p> <p>\"Today, we're seeing a similar process of outsourcing. Government can't tell you how to vote, but it allows CEOs to do so.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Robin concluded:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When workers are forced to go to rallies in communist countries, we call that Stalinism. Here, we call it the free market.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>Former Conservative cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken was convicted in&#xa0;1999 of perjury and perverting the course of justice and served seven months in jail. Conrad Black, who once owned the Telegraph and has a seat in the House of Lords, was released from a US prison this year after serving time for fraud and obstruction of justice. This week they met to compare experiences. Susanna Rustin listened in.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Aitken:</strong> Anyone who's been through the experience of incarceration as a high-profile prisoner faces special challenges. One way to succeed is to go with the flow and find a way of getting on with the guys you are in with.</p> <p><strong>Conrad Black:</strong> In the US system, 97% of prosecutions end in guilty pleas and 85% of cases that go to trial are convictions. There's huge resentment of such an over-mighty prosecution system and respect for anyone who fights it. Because mine was a famous case, and the prisoners saw my arrival on CNN, they thought here's somebody who fought the system. So I was sort of a good chap in advance.</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong> I pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. That's a much easier way to go through it. I found it harder coming out of prison than going in, because people's attitudes to you are so strange.</p> <p><strong>Susanna Rustin:</strong> How did you find getting out of jail?</p> <p><strong>CB:</strong> Extremely agreeable. Because I was not a US citizen, I was handed over to the immigration and customs enforcement agency and conducted to Miami airport where my wife [Barbara Amiel] was waiting for me. We had a charter and we went right to the front of the line and took off. It was a very happy trip. My wife normally takes a dim view of any form of drinking, particularly prior to noon, but she served me a very nice glass of white wine at about 10am.</p> <p><strong>SR:</strong> Do you remember your first night in prison?</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong> I do for one comic reason and one scary reason. The comic reason was that on the day I was sentenced I was the most notorious person in the country. When I got inside I was interviewed by a&#xa0;prison psychiatrist who was blissfully ignorant of who I was. When he asked, \"Does anyone other than your next of kin know you're in prison?\" and I said, \"Maybe by now 20 million people know,\" he scribbled on his pad and became rather kind and asked had I&#xa0;ever suffered from delusions. The sinister reason was that when I got into my cell the prisoners set up a chant, and the gist of it was that Aitken has arrived, tomorrow morning let's show him! I&#xa0;now know that's what happens every night in Belmarsh. But I&#xa0;thought they meant it, so I was scared.</p> <p><strong>SR:</strong> Were you scared by prison?</p> <p><strong>CB:</strong> My spirits weren't lowered too much. My wife accused me of pretending it was Camp New Moon [a children's summer camp in Canada]. But I was worried about getting on. My background, like Jonathan's, is different from most of the people we were with and I&#xa0;didn't want to be an outcast. But they couldn't have been nicer, and I soon recognised the politics of the place \u2013 there were heads of ethnic groups and factions. The first night I was there, a mafioso came over and said nobody would bother me.</p> <p><strong>JA: </strong>Some people said to me, once you're out you'll go back to being a big cheese and forget about us. And I haven't. I made one tremendous friend in prison, and until he died recently I saw him twice a&#xa0;week. At my wedding [to Elizabeth Harris in 2003] by some strange statistical quirk there was the same number of ex-cabinet members as ex-cons.</p> <p><strong>SR:</strong> Did prison change your views on criminal justice?</p> <p><strong>CB:</strong> I was always rather liberal on these matters in American terms. We have to make a special case for violent people, obviously the public has to have some protection from them. But I think prison for non-violent people is nonsense.</p> <p><strong>SR:</strong> What is the appropriate punishment for people convicted, as you were, of financial crimes?</p> <p><strong>CB:</strong> Working for free, or if they have no means of support, then living in shelters [hostels] under a basic regime, contributing their service to designated causes. If you get recidivism you have to imprison people, but most in my opinion would not be repeat offenders.</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong> I get called a prison reformer now, and in a sense that's true, but the reforms this country ought to focus on are not the prison system, which is quite decently run, but rehabilitation.</p> <p><strong>CB:</strong> In the US private prisons are always agitating for more criminal offences, longer sentences and a larger prison population. It's just like any other business, only more tawdry and corrupt.</p> <p><strong>SR:</strong> What does it feel like to fall from the pinnacle of the British establishment to public humiliation?</p> <p><strong>CB:</strong> I was so contemptuous of the process by which I was sent to prison that I was determined not to let it diminish me. It was a novelty. I&#xa0;had never been in a milieu like this before, so I was naturally curious. I was relieved it wasn't more difficult. It was tedious and it was unjust that I was there at all. But I didn't find it humiliating.</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong> The struggle is to survive and say, I'm going to start again, I know I've got to have a different life but it may not be a worse life. I don't want to minimise the struggle of it, but I think reasonably strong characters \u2013 and I suspect Conrad and I could both be put in that bracket \u2013 are not going to go to pieces. The question is, how do you come back from that?</p> <p><strong>CB:</strong> I got messages of support every day and found them very encouraging. Some people I took to be friends were disappointing, but many people from whom I had no right to expect anything filled up much of that gap. I thought Rupert Murdoch [whose newspapers criticised Black] revealed himself as an absolutely beastly and terrible man, despite his very great achievements.</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong> I start from the notion that the \"hoops of steel\" club, as Shakespeare calls it, is very small. My friends in that category were rock solid. There were surprises among the rest. Two days after I was released, Denis Thatcher asked me to lunch at his club. I think if I was to go through the disappointments list with Conrad, we might find some people in common \u2013 Max Hastings for example.</p> <p><strong>SR:</strong> How important was religion?</p> <p><strong>CB:</strong> If you believe in God I think it's much easier to believe there is some purpose even when inexplicably unjust things are happening. Also, there's the idea that a setback on this scale is something you must draw a lesson from and work hard to see what the lesson might be. History is full of people who did come back from terrible setbacks and so you never lose hope. You aren't out of the game altogether, you just have to regroup.</p> <p><strong>JA: </strong>I would hate to have gone through all this without there being a huge spiritual element. To this day I do quite a lot of faith-based work in prisons.</p> <p><strong>SR:</strong> Should prisoners have the vote?</p> <p><strong>JA: </strong>No for constitutional reasons. I hate the idea of the British being pushed around by Strasbourg judges.</p> <p><strong>CB:</strong> For me there is a distinction between people convicted of violent crimes, who I think while they're in prison shouldn't have the vote. And the others shouldn't be in prison anyway so they should.</p> <p><strong>SR:</strong> Jonathan's first marriage ended in divorce. Did your marriage suffer?</p> <p><strong>CB:</strong> I think it was more difficult for my&#xa0;wife because she had a lonelier life without me. She doesn't like Florida, but she stayed there a lot because it was near to me. In the summer it's terribly hot and she has these magnificent dogs that have heavy fur coats. It was very uncomfortable for them.</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;A Matter of Principle by Conrad Black is published by Biteback, price \u00a314.99.</p>",
  "<p>A celebrity-backed, two-year campaign to save a public library that was opened by Mark Twain in 1900 is facing failure after the Oxford college that owns the building confirmed that it is in talks with a property developer to turn most of it into flats.</p> <p>Zadie Smith, Philip Pullman and Alan Bennett were among the authors who backed the campaign to save Kensal Rise library in north-west London, but All Souls College, Oxford, is now negotiating a sell-off that would leave room for only a small library. Campaigners have dismissed that as tokenistic.</p> <p>\"We feel quite shocked and shafted somewhat,\" said Margaret Bailey, the director of the Friends of Kensal Rise Library. \"Our proposal was to take on the whole building, run the library on the ground floor and get tenants in for the other floors such as from community groups and housing associations.\"</p> <p>The ownership of the library building returned to All Souls after the London borough of Brent decided to close it down in May, citing dwindling visitor numbers and \"the state of the buildings themselves\".</p> <p>There were bitter clashes between campaigners and officials and allegations of philistinism when the books, murals and the plaque commemorating Twain were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/may/29/kensal-rise-library-stripped-books?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">removed in the early hours of a morning</a> in May. All Souls <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/31/kensal-rise-library-regret?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">distanced itself from Brent's actions</a>. The college then began a process of exploring the options for the future of the building and in September this year invited proposals from developers and others.</p> <p>Thomas Seaman, the college bursar, said All Souls was sympathetic to the library campaigners and that the college had been impressed by the campaigners' insistence on the need for the library to continue operating. The campaigners set out to raise \u00a370,000 for their proposal to run a community library and exceeded their target by more than \u00a310,000.</p> <p>\"The college is pursuing a solution that would sustain library services in Kensal Rise and we have told the Friends of Kensal Rise Library we want them to run it,\" he said. \"We are currently discussing with a bidder who will allow a portion of the building to be a library in perpetuity. We chose to go forward with a solution that will create a newly renovated library space and the college will do a great deal to help them in this regard.\"</p> <p>But the campaigners said the space on offer amounted to less than half of the ground floor and this was insufficient. \"The pound signs are dangling in front of the college,\" added Desmond Clarke, a national library campaigner and former director at the publishers Faber and Faber. \"It is sad given All Souls is remarkably well-endowed college.\"</p> <p>All Souls stressed it was a charity and the trustees were responsible for ensuring it meets its charitable objectives. Its registered purpose is to \"advance research and education, particularly in the humanities, law, the social sciences, the natural sciences, and mathematics; promote the links between the academic world and public life; and maintain the tradition of the college as a place of prayer\".</p> <p>The campaign group wrote to supporters explaining its next steps. \"We will meet with this developer next week to see if there is any room for negotiation,\" Bailey wrote. \"There is also another bid being prepared by a developer that would be much more generous to us and this will be with the college on Monday. Once we know what is on offer we will be having a public meeting to share these details with you and to find out how you want to proceed.\"</p>",

  "<p>Elizabeth Bell, who has died aged 71 of cancer of the oesophagus, was an accomplished and versatile actor who was associated in&nbsp;particular with Alan Ayckbourn, although she also appeared with the English Stage Company at the Royal Court, the&nbsp;National theatre and at other London venues such as the Almeida and the Bush. She appeared in the inaugural season of Britain's first dedicated theatre-in-the-round, at Stoke-on-Trent, the brainchild of Stephen Joseph, whose acolytes, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/apr/29/peter-cheeseman-obituary\" title=\"\">Peter Cheeseman</a> and&nbsp;Ayckbourn, were, respectively, director and actor with the company.</p> <p>Ayckbourn was already writing plays while acting at the Library theatre in&nbsp;Scarborough between 1957 and 1962, and that company went with him to Stoke. Bell played a secretary to&nbsp;Ayckbourn's leading role in Christmas V Mastermind (1962), the last of his plays in which he also acted. The other two leading women in the company were Caroline Smith (later a director) and Heather Stoney (later Ayckbourn's second wife).</p> <p>Bell was struck for life by the passion and commitment to new work of these repertory theatre idealists \u2013 Joseph resembling a socialist realist poster in his paint-stained overalls, with his hammer at the ready \u2013 and she first saw Ayckbourn in the 1958 season at&nbsp;Scarborough, \"causing a few hearts to flutter,\" she told his biographer, Paul&nbsp;Allen.</p> <p>She was the daughter of Elizabeth and Neil Bell, born in Clifton, Leeds. Her father left when she was four and her mother, brother and grandmother moved to Scarborough, where she attended the girls' high school. She then opted for drama school, winning both the gold medal and the Sybil Thorndike prize at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London in 1961.</p> <p>A founder member of the Victoria theatre, now the New Vic, in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, she went on to work at the Royal Court in Peter Gill's definitive productions of Thomas Otway's The Soldier's Fortune in 1967 and DH Lawrence's The Daughter-in-Law (on tour), and as a highly regarded, languorously beautiful Yelena in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/mar/20/2\" title=\"\">Paul Scofield</a> Uncle Vanya, directed by&nbsp;Anthony Page in 1970.</p> <p>By 1971 she was living with the architect Henry Osborne who, following a divorce settlement, was converting a&nbsp;house he had built in Hampstead, north London, into two separate dwellings. He asked Bell if she knew of&nbsp;anyone who would like to buy the front half \u2013 and that is how Ayckbourn and Stoney became London neighbours of their Scarborough colleague.</p> <p>Bell made numerous television appearances, notably as Thea Elvsted in John Osborne's version of Hedda Gabler in 1981, with Diana Rigg and Alan Dobie, and many radio programmes, where she was always in demand for drama as well as readings on the BBC's Woman's Hour, Front Row, Poetry Please and Night Waves.</p> <p>She was also a notable member of Ayckbourn's 1987 company at the National Theatre, appearing opposite Michael Gambon in Arthur Miller's A&nbsp;View from the Bridge \u2013 her Beatrice was kind, anxious, perceptive, a&nbsp;masterclass in how to make goodness interesting; and as Anita, a dissatisfied housewife who has substituted whips, manacles and endless lovers for a pig of a husband with a Porsche and a little boat, in Ayckbourn's masterful study of a nation on the skids, A Small Family Business.</p> <p>Back at Scarborough, she created the role of Imogen (played in London by&nbsp;Joanna Lumley) in Ayckbourn's two-part epic The Revenger's Comedies (1989) and stayed on to play Emilia in&nbsp;the Michael Gambon Othello (Ken Stott was Iago, Claire Skinner Desdemona) the following year, and Lizzie, an erotic and self-deceiving former showgirl who, said the Guardian's Michael Billington, talks about her career as though she had been in the Bolshoi, in a revival of Ayckbourn's brilliantly structured Taking Steps.</p> <p>The better the company, the more Bell would shine, as was evident in David Hare's version of Brecht's The&nbsp;Life of&nbsp;Galileo (directed by Jonathan Kent), cast to the nines with Richard Griffiths in the lead, at the Almeida in 1994, and in Rodney Ackland's Absolute Hell (directed by Anthony Page) at the National in 1995, in which she played a&nbsp;socialist rich bitch in a&nbsp;bohemian gallery (Betty Marsden, Peter Woodthorpe, Sheila Burrell, June Brown, Barbara Hicks), supervised by Judi Dench as the hostess with the leastest.</p> <p>In her later years, Bell was a mentor for Central School students, an external examiner for Trinity College London and an in-house audio describer for the National theatre. She was one of the first actors to join the InterAct reading service for hospitals and stroke clubs.</p> <p>Her last stage appearances included a fussy old cleaning woman in Simon Bent's Chekhovian slice of west London low-life, Goldhawk Road, at&nbsp;the Bush in 1996, a powerful Duchess of York opposite Eddie Marsan's psychotic Richard III at the Pleasance in 1997, and a Rosa Kleb-like corrupt finance minister in The UN Inspector (Michael Sheen starring as the updated Gogol hero) at the National in 2005, wielding a&nbsp;deadly handbag containing a&nbsp;poisonous syringe.</p> <p>In 2007 she succeeded Frances de la Tour as Miss Lintott in Alan Bennett's The History Boys in the West End, treating her, said Billington, as \"a fount of practical wisdom\" and leading him to&nbsp;conclude that the history teacher was, in fact, Bennett's real hero.</p> <p>She is survived by Osborne, whom she married last year, and her stepchildren, Abigail and Ben.</p> <p><strong>Alan Ayckbourn writes:</strong> I worked with Liz in various capacities, as a director, a writer-director and in the early days as a fellow actor. So over the years I&nbsp;got to know her very well. We first met in our Scarborough theatre's original home in the public library when she, a tall, attractive drama student, was introduced to me, a fully fledged acting/assistant stage manager with all of 18 months' professional experience under my belt.</p> <p>I remember, in the face of my cocky, faux-blas\u00e9 manner, her shyness, reducing her to deep-toned monosyllables. A year or two later, considerably less shy and more vocal, she was back with the company as an actor, many of the qualities later to distinguish her as a performer already in place. A remarkable, distinctive voice, deep enough to make a 20-year-old clench his toes with excitement; in appearance, striking rather than conventionally beautiful but, onstage, blessed with that natural god-given sexual attractiveness which no amount of acting artifice or cosmetic cunning can ever quite achieve. Her range, too, in&nbsp;one so young, was considerable.</p> <p>Having seen her perform the Strange Lady in Shaw's Man of Destiny, I&nbsp;promptly cast her as a 60-something dotty old spinster in A Thief in Time (needs must when budgets are limited). Later, we appeared together onstage playing eccentric lovers, Fred and Maisie, in William Norfolk's new play, The Birds and the Well Wishers, and brother and sister, Roderick and Madeleine, in David Campton's adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's The Fall of the House of Usher.</p> <p>To act with, she was a joy. To direct, she was often challenging, forever questioning, not content to accept things purely on face value and, like any good actor, never settling for anything less than dramatic truth. If that makes her sound a tough proposition, then once her questions were answered, doubts reassured, she was fiercely loyal to you and the production.</p> <p>Later on, in the 1980s, I was invited by Peter Hall to form my own company at the NT. I approached Liz to ask her if&nbsp;she would like to be part of it, playing Beatrice opposite Gambon in A View from the Bridge and, again by stark contrast, the sexually provocative Anita in my own premiere, A Small Family Business.</p> <p>Over the phone, to my surprise, she sounded hesitant, almost reluctant. It&nbsp;was only after I spelt it out to her that the penny dropped. She was convinced that I had phoned to offer her the understudy roles. It was another side to her which, though present in most performers, one rarely saw: uncertainty, lack of confidence and vulnerability. She&nbsp;was a touchingly complex, infuriatingly intriguing actor \u2013 and a&nbsp;fierce, loyal, dear friend.</p> <p>\u2022 Elizabeth Bell, actor, born 20 March 1941; died 21 October 2012</p>",
  "<p>Harlem D\u00e9sir, the former anti-racism campaigner, will take leadership of the French Socialist party at a congress this weekend \u2013 the first time a black politician has headed a major French party.</p> <p>D\u00e9sir, an MEP, shot to fame in the 1980s as a young anti-discrimination campaigner who headed the SOS Racisme movement in France, leading vast street rallies against prejudice and the rise of the far right. Born in Paris to a father from the French Caribbean island of Martinique and a mother from Alsace, he was named Harlem as a tribute to the struggles of African Americans after slavery.</p> <p>In his 20s he was a feisty rights advocate who captivated TV audiences, a philosophy graduate from an ordinary background who had not studied at the elite graduate schools that dominate the political class. But now, after decades as a faithful apparatchik of the Socialist party machine, the media has criticised him for wooden, mealy-mouthed politician-speak and warned he lacked the charisma to be a potential French Barack Obama. Seen as willing to unquestioningly toe the line under Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's presidency, D\u00e9sir is under pressure to make his mark and spell out his vision for the party at this weekend's party congress in Toulouse.</p> <p>He takes over at a moment when the Socialist party enjoys the most power it has ever had in France, holding the presidency, the parliament, the senate, and most regions and large cities.

It took place as the ceasefire called to mark the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha was already faltering in parts of the country, with regime forces and rebel groups blaming each other for the violations.</p> <p>Car bombs have been increasingly used by rebel groups, including the Islamist Jabhat al-Nusraf organisation, which has some ideological links to the global jihad movement. However, such groups have largely targeted security bases.</p> <p>This bomb hit Daff al-Shouk square, where families were celebrating Eid, on the southern outskirts of the capital. No group had claimed responsibility for the blast by nightfall.</p> <p>Earlier, the truce brokered by the UN-Arab League peace envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, had done little to stem the violence in parts of Syria, including parts of Damascus and ravaged districts of Aleppo.</p> <p>The Local Co-ordination Committees, which monitor violence daily, reported 110 breaches of the truce and around 48 deaths, a toll that is sharply down on any other day in recent months. Other areas of the country, such as the cities of Homs and Hama, were quieter than in recent months. Activists there reported that families had taken to the streets of some neighbourhoods to celebrate one of the holiest occasions in the Islamic calendar.</p> <p>In Aleppo, the centre of violence since rebels stormed the city in mid-July, gains made by opposition fighters in three districts on Thursday were partially clawed back by the army. Rebels had moved into the districts, reporting little resistance from a Kurdish militia in one of the areas and Syrian troops in two others. Little ground had previously changed hands in Aleppo despite more than two months of fighting. Syrian forces retain control of much of the west of the city and strategic points on the outskirts, such as the airport. However, they remain unable to secure the east of the city, despite near constant aerial bombardment of rebels in some districts.</p> <p>On Thursday Turkey denied a Human Rights Watch claim that it was preventing thousands of Syrian refugees from crossing into its territory. Turkey is hosting about 103,000 Syrian refugees and says it expects thousands more as winter closes in. Refugee groups claim some of those fleeing have been unable to cross from Syria since late August. Lebanon and Jordan are sheltering similar numbers to Turkey. All three states say they are under-prepared for an expected influx in the last weeks of autumn.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch senior refugee researcher Gerry Simpson said: \" General assurances [from Turkey] alone will not open borders. Thousands of desperate Syrians remain stuck inside Syria on the Turkish and Iraqi borders amidst mounting insecurity and with winter fast approaching.</p> <p>\"Human Rights Watch calls on the UN refugee agency to report publicly on which border crossings are closed and how many Syrians are stuck inside Syria as a result.\"</p>",
  "<p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/25/penguin-random-house-merger-talks\" title=\"\">merger of Random House and Penguin</a> would create a \u00a32.5bn trade publisher \u2013 by some distance the biggest ever seen. Authors such as E L James, Salman Rushdie, John le Carre, Pippa Middleton, and Jamie Oliver may become bedfellows. No wonder agents and authors are using words like \"scary\" and \"sad\" in reaction to the news.</p> <p>But this is a consolidation driven not by authors, but by big tech giants, such as Amazon, and Apple, on whose platforms book publishers must now play.</p> <p>Even at that size the \"House of the Random Penguin\" (as it must surely be known) would be a squib compared to those companies \u2013 6% the size of Amazon, 8% of Google, and just 2% of Apple \u2013 but at least it might get a voice in the background, perhaps even a seat at the table.</p> <p>There has been talk of consolidation at the top of consumer publishing for a number of years now. Some believe the over the next decade the so-called \"big six\" publishers \u2013 in addition to \"Pengdom\", the list includes Hachette, Macmillan, Simon &amp; Schuster, and HarperCollins \u2013 will slowly be whittled down into the \"top two\".</p> <p>But mega-mergers in trade publishing have been on hold since 2006, when Hachette bought Time Warner's consumer book publishing business. Since then the big houses have been dancing around each other without ever quite coming close enough to begin talking dowries. The surprise here is not the talks, but those doing the talking. This may be a marriage of convenience, but shotguns were not involved: Random House is already the biggest trade publisher in the US and in the UK, thanks to the huge success of Fifty Shades, it is also back in the top spot. Penguin is somewhat smaller in both markets, but its brand is huge. Both are backed by huge media groups, RH by the German giant Bertelsmann, and Penguin by Pearson, the owner of education publisher Pearson Education, and of course the Financial Times (which broke the news of these talks on Thursday).</p> <p>The theory is surely that by putting Bertelsmann's corporate engine inside Penguin's Rolls Royce body, a vehicle can be manufactured that will race up the digital autobahns, while also appealing to consumers. Publishers are making a decent fist of \"getting digital\", but is the big tech groups that control the routes to the end user. Random House's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/30/clockwork-orange-burgess-app-ipad\" title=\"\">Clockwork Orange app</a>, and Penguin's forthcoming Diary of Anne Frank app, show businesses that are evolving how they use their content skills in this space, but it is Apple that will decide the release date of the apps, not the publishers. Similarly, Amazon controls 90% of the ebook market in the UK, and close to 40% of sales of all books. Fall foul of negotiations with the Seattle giant and buy buttons will be turned off. And if you are not selling ebooks through Amazon, then you are not selling ebooks at all. Publishers desperately need leverage, and they need money to build alternative platforms. Since the US Department of Justice \u2013 which earlier this year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/11/apple-accused-fixing-prices-ebooks\" title=\"\">sued the big US publishers over colluding to bring in fixed ebook prices</a> \u2013 has effectively ended collaboration, consolidation remains the only option.</p> <p>The worry for authors, agents, and smaller bookshop chains such as Waterstones, is that Penguin House would have too great a market share of consumer book sales: with judicious pruning this share might be taken down below the 25% threshold meaning the Competition Commission could nod it through. But in reality, in literary and commercial fiction, their hold would be bigger, and fearsome. The duo account for six titles in this week's mass-market fiction top 10 alone.</p> <p>But those fears look misplaced (at least in the wider context). Even within the larger publishers, such as Hachette, or Random House, individual imprints of the stature of Jonathan Cape, John Murray, and Michael Joseph would bid against each other. It is naive to imagine that the big groups don't set ceilings, but in truth advances are being driven down by fears over the future of high street bookshops and the shift to digital, not by consolidation at the top. The publishing world is also kept honest by those smaller independent publishers, such as Profile Books, often run by individuals discarded by the big groups. A publishing deal is still a relationship between one editor, one agent, and one author. The essence of this won't change.</p> <p>The Competition Commission could yet have a role to play, particularly if it chose to investigate the book market more widely, as many hoped it would do when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/27/amazon-takeover-book-depository-oft\" title=\"\">Amazon bought The Book Depository in 2011</a>. But it would need to get the details straight \u2013 in a way it lamentably failed to do when it nodded that acquisition through, despite a chorus of complaint from publishers and booksellers.</p> <p>Make no mistake, this is a huge deal, long on implication for many in the publishing business, and a shape of things to come. But the giants in the book business are no longer the publishers, whatever their sleeping arrangements.</p>",

When the morphine was doing its job, David would be pain-free, surrounded by his family, joking, or (unusual for him) telling them how they had enriched his life and how much he loved them. That is how dying should be. And proper palliative care allows that \u2013 the space and time for the dying and the grieving to say those things they need to say, to give each other reassurance, comfort and love.</p> <p>But mostly it was not like that.

  "<p>After a nanny allegedly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/26/new-york-nanny-suspect\">killed two children in her care</a> on the upper west side of New York on Thursday afternoon before apparently attempting suicide, the message boards at Urban Baby lit up with one consistent theme: how this terrible event will affect the relationship between parents and carers.</p> <p>\"I think after this tragedy with the nanny, people will be very hesitant to hire,\" one post began.</p> <p>\"Yes for sure!\" was the immediate response. \"I've had mine for five years and we love her like family but even so right now I'm a bit freaked out!\"</p> <p>And then \u2013 most tellingly: \"How many of you with nannies now will look at them more carefully?\"</p> <p>The nanny world in New York is like that of any other major metropolitan city \u2013 unorganized, vital, filled with a mix of experienced carers and inexperienced teens. Meanwhile working families are completely dependent on childcare. Without someone to take care of the kids \u2013 particularly in the years before they start school \u2013 a parent can't work. There is very little organized daycare available in the city, so in order for a mother and father to gain employment, they have to become an employer.</p> <p>So this economic backbone of the city is considered a subculture at best. Hires are mostly done by word of mouth. Despite bravado talk of background checks, they are as rare as nanny cams. There are agencies, but they are expensive. References are often out of date or inaccurate and impossible to check. Many nannies or babysitters advertise their services with homemade signs they stick up in pediatricians offices, libraries, the entrance to school and even lamp posts, with tear strips of their phone numbers printed at the bottom. Payment is low and in cash. Many nannies come from immigrant communities and work for affluent white families. Resentment on both sides is common.</p> <p>Mothers (and the relationship between parents and nannies is conducted mostly through the mother, although that balance is beginning to change) want to believe they are leaving their small children in not just safe but loving hands. Yet, while the violent circumstances of Thursday's incident are unique, employment often ends in a moment, with a nanny just disappearing or a family firing her on the spot.</p> <p>In a situation where parents want to feel they are conducting a relationship not a transaction, trust is a fragile commodity. Familiarity flows one way. A nanny may know practically everything about her employers, but they are rarely interested in the domestic circumstances of her own life. Parents confide in her, they think of her as \"family\", but she rarely is.</p> <p>The Krim family were different in this regard. They had actually visited their nanny's home in the Dominican Republic and even spent a few days at her sister's home in Santiago. \"We met Josie's amazing familia!!!\" Marina Krim wrote on her family blog. \"And the Dominican Republic is a wonderful country!! More pics to come!!\"</p> <p>The relative affluence of the Krims' neighborhood, close to Central Park, and the family's schedule for the day in which this happened, was typical for New York City. In the late afternoon, when the murders of six-year-old Lulu and two-year-old Leo apparently took place, their mother, Marina Krim, 38, was at a swimming lesson with three-year-old Nessie. Their father, Kevin, a CNBC executive, was on a plane back from the west coast. Marina Krim did not work full-time. She taught occasional art classes at the local playground, where nannies and mothers often interact, and regularly blogged about her family life, posting pictures and amusing comments.</p> <p>Many women on the upper west side of New York quit their careers when their children are born and stay at home with them. It's not unusual for these stay-at-home mothers to be able to afford to hire full- or part-time supplemental help on the basis of their husband's salary alone. Like Marina Krim, they divide the childcare with the nanny, taking their kids to classes and playgroups the park or the children's museums, the beach or local farms. They volunteer at school. While this is beyond the reach of most families in New York, in affluent circles, this is normal. </p> <p>But the shock of this crime transcends class boundaries, and families all over the city and beyond must be asking themselves the same questions. Will more mothers stay at home with their children after this killing? How many will, as the message boards ask, look at their nannies differently and trust them less? Will sales of nanny cams go up and background checks increase? Irrational panic is inevitable. Some women may think about quitting their jobs, and others might even consider letting their nannies go. </p> <p>As for nannies, they will fear that attitudes towards them will harden. As one nanny posted on Urban Baby: \"I'm \u2026 frightened that people will start thinking that all nannies are the sort who would somehow 'snap' and hurt children. I promise, I swear to you, we're not all like that and some of us are just as tearful tonight as you moms are \u2026 It breaks my heart, even more than the murder, that those children died frightened and betrayed by someone who was supposed to love and protect them. </p> <p>\"It makes me want to stop being a nanny and become a ... superhero, or a cop with laser eyes, or someone so strong that I could stop anyone who wanted to hurt kids anywhere. Instead, I know I'll just keep going to work and hugging the kids, because what else can we do?\"</p> <p>It is, of course, impossible to make sense out of something so senseless. But it's clear that an already uneasy relationship has overnight become altogether more complex.</p>",
  "<p>\"In the distant future they will have what I call 'the Tickles',\" said Alfred Hitchcock in 1963. \"People will go into a big darkened auditorium and they will be mass-hypnotized. Instead of identifying themselves with the characters on screen, they will be that character, and when they buy their ticket, they will be able to choose which character to be. They will suffer all of the agonies and enjoy the romance with a beautiful woman or handsome man. I call them 'the Tickles' because when a character is tickled, the audience will feel it. Then, the lights come up and it's all over.\"</p> <p>Hitchcock, son of a greengrocer, started off in theatre and moved into film, the new medium of his age, changing how we told stories. My background, meanwhile, is in audience engagement for the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/\" title=\"\">BBC</a>. But in November 2010, after successfully launching the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/DoctorWho\" title=\"\">Facebook page for Doctor Who</a>, I started asking myself the question: how would Alfred tell a story today?</p> <p>Not with a film, was my conclusion. Instead I think he would be using all the devices now available to us to tell stories \u2013 and one thing's for sure, his audience would take part in them.</p> <p>The biggest problem with this new audience appetite for immersive worlds is finding writers who know how to create them. When my company <a href=\"http://www.portalentertainment.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Portal Entertainment</a> started out there were no 'immersive writers' \u2013 TV writers tell great linear stories, while game writers focus on the non-linear, but their concept of dramatic conflict can be weak. We decided to create an event to rectify this.</p> <p>Together with BBC Writers Room, Circalit, Imaginox and Stellar Network we created the <a href=\"http://www.imaginox.co.uk/course/2397\" title=\"\">Immersive Writing Lab</a>, a two day event in August 2011 and accompanying three month competition to develop and grow the immersive writers of tomorrow. We got more than 120 entries, read more than 2,500 pages and we are now working with the winner of last year's competition.</p> <p>This year, the lab returns with a focus on roleplay \u2013 how to get your audience to discover and navigate themselves through your story. The best way we've found to try and solve this challenge is looking laterally at forms of entertainment that have been changing their performance mode for hundreds of years \u2013 comedy, immersive theatre and magic \u2013 as well as new forms of entertainment such as interactive comics and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/researchanddevelopment/2012/07/what-is-perceptive-media.shtml\" title=\"\">the 'perceptive media' coming out of BBC R&amp;D</a>. Curious minds are definitely welcome.</p> <p>After a first day of theory, we run the fun bit, the workshop, where teams of writers work together to come up with a storyworld. Henry Jenkins, screenwriter and author of <a href=\"http://henryjenkins.org/2006/06/welcome_to_convergence_culture.html\" title=\"\">Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide</a>, puts it this way: \"When I first started, you would pitch a story because without a good story you didn't really have a film. Later, once sequels started to take off, you pitched a character because a good character could support multiple stories. And now, you pitch a world because a world can support multiple characters and multiple stories across multiple media.\"</p> <p>The workshop day ran fantastically well last year \u2013 and a lot of those same teams are still working together. In the next few months, we will run another three month competition, with \u00a36,000 going to the winning storyworld. We don't have all the answers, but if the Immersive Writing Lab has taught us anything, it's that there are more curious minds than ever who want to create worlds for audiences to take part in, regardless of the medium. If you are one of them, the lab might just be for you.</p> <p>... and you never know. We might just end up making your world.</p> <p><em>Julian McCrea runs Portal Entertainment, a digital entertainment company that specialises in immersive entertainment \u2013 follow him on Twitter </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/julianmccrea\" title=\"\"><em>@julianmccrea</em></a><em> or like </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PortalEntertainment\" title=\"\"><em>Portal Entertainment's Facebook page</em></a><em> </em></p> <p><em>To find out more, visit the </em><a href=\"http://dmic.org.uk/event/immersive-writing-lab/\" title=\"\"><em>Immersive Writing Lab site</em></a><em> and follow </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/thelitplatform\" title=\"\"><em>@thelitplatform</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Jim Jones is trying to quiet the Camden Town crowd. \"Imagine,\" he tells them, \"you're a teenager having sex in your bedroom and you don't want your mum to find out.\" In that sentence is captured the essence of his Revue: Jones and guitarist Rupert Orton (brother of Beth) are old enough to be the parents of said teenager, but they're&nbsp;still in thrall to the sex and danger of&nbsp;rock'n'roll.</p> <p>And so, with no embarrassment, legs are splayed and instruments are thrust outwards. Their motto seems to be: what's the point of having an electric guitar if you can't pretend it's a giant penis? And what's the point in writing songs if you can't call them <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQd\\_lfMS5aM\" title=\"\">Killin' Spree</a> or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuHaQ49hTL8\" title=\"\">Shoot First</a>?</p> <p>It should be silly, especially when paired with music that joins the dots between Memphis in 1956, Detroit in 1969 and London and New York in 1977:&nbsp;the Jim Jones Revue take a reductive view of pop history. But if there is silliness, it's the right kind \u2013&nbsp;this&nbsp;is never a joke, it's an act of love to the music. With dry ice rolling across&nbsp;the stage, and the sharply dressed band backlit and silhouetted for much of the show, this is exactly how you would describe a rock'n'roll show to a Martian.</p> <p>The Revue's third album, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/oct/11/jim-jones-revue-savage-heart-review\" title=\"\">The Savage&nbsp;Heart</a>, sees the energy levels reined in a little. The band no longer sound like they're racing each other to the end of every song. That album is well represented tonight, but in truth the Revue could do with upping the tempo a little in the middle of the set. Their four most berserk rockers \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVClmEKbm0I\" title=\"\">Rock'n'Roll Psychosis</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ZlcLXFKTI\" title=\"\">Dishonest John</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ur6QowQbM\" title=\"\">Elemental</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujjgaR1LEI\" title=\"\">High Horse</a> \u2013 are saved for the very end of the set and the&nbsp;encores.</p> <p>But this is all relative. Even at their most understated, the Revue still sound several times more raucous than most bands. \"Elemental!\" Jones shrieks. \"She's out of control!\" He might as well be singing about himself.</p> <p>\u2022 What have you been to see lately?

  "<p>Two gay Jamaicans have launched a legal challenge to colonial-era laws, which in effect criminalise homosexuality, on the grounds that they are unconstitutional and promote homophobia throughout the Caribbean.</p> <p>The landmark action, supported by the UK-based Human Dignity Trust, is aimed at removing three clauses of the island's Offences Against Persons Act of 1864, commonly known as the \"buggery\" laws.</p> <p>The battle over the legislation \u2013 blamed by critics for perpetuating a popular culture of hatred for \"batty boys\", as gay men are derided in some dancehall music \u2013 has also drawn a British lawyer into the debate, who said that Jamaica should not follow the legislative example of the UK.</p> <p>The legal challenge is being taken to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which is modelled on the European Court of Human Rights. Jamaica is not a full member and any ruling would only be advisory and not binding; it would, nonetheless, send out a strong signal of international disapproval.</p> <p>When the Jamaican prime minister, Portia Simpson Miller, was elected last December, she said she would hire a gay person to serve in her cabinet and condemned discrimination. Despite early sympathetic signals, her government has not attempted to repeal the laws.</p> <p>The Offences Against Persons Act does not formally ban homosexuality but clause 76 provides for up to 10 years' imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for anyone convicted of the \"abominable crime of buggery committed either with mankind or any animal\". Two further clauses outlaw attempted buggery and gross indecency between two men.</p> <p>Jamaica has one of the highest murder rates in the world. Murders of gay men are increasing, according to Dane Lewis, executive director of the Jamaica Forum of Lesbians, All-Sexuals and Gays (J-Flag), who is one of those petitioning the commission.</p> <p>\"This year alone there have been nine [murders],\" he said. \"The violence in Jamaica is having a spillover effect on other parts of the Caribbean: St Lucia now has a murder or so every year.\"</p> <p>One prominent victim was John Terry, the British honorary consul in Montego Bay, who was found dead in 2009 having been beaten and strangled. A note left on his body read: \"This is what will happen to all gays.\"</p> <p>Many gay Jamaicans have fled abroad, some to the UK. In 2002, two gay Jamaican men were granted asylum in the UK because their lives were in danger from \"severe homophobia\" in the Caribbean.</p> <p>Senior Jamaican police officers have in the past dismissed killings as the result of gay-on-gay \"crimes of passion\" \u2013 an interpretation disputed by civil rights groups.</p> <p>In a House of Lords debate this week on the treatment of homosexual men and women in the developing world, the Conservative Lord Lexden said a \"wave of persecution and violence has been suffered by gay people connected with [J-Flag]\". Intolerance of homosexuality, he noted, was a legacy of the British empire: \"Today, 42 of the 54 nations of the Commonwealth criminalise same-sex relations.\"</p> <p>Jonathan Cooper, a London barrister who is the chief executive of the Human Dignity Trust, said: \"We want to ensure that Jamaica satisfies its international human rights treaty obligations. We are supporting J-Flag in this case.</p> <p>\"These, and two accompanying cases supported by Aids-Free World, are the first cases before the Inter-American Commission but the issue is clear in international human rights law.\"</p> <p>The UN's International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Jamaica is a signatory, protects private adult, consensual sexual activity.</p> <p>J-Flag has also received free pro-bono advice from the UK City law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in drawing up their legal challenge.</p> <p>One of the main bodies arguing to preserve the Offences Against Person Act is the Lawyers' Christian Fellowship in Jamaica (which has no connection to the UK Lawyers' Christian Fellowship).</p> <p>Paul Diamond, a British barrister and Evangelical Christian who specialises in religious discrimination cases, took part in a debate on Jamaica's laws at the University of the West Indies last December.</p> <p>\"[Jamaicans] feel they are being pressurised by the UK and US governments in terms of visas and aid grants to modify their position [on homosexuality], which they say is morally based,\" Diamond told the Guardian. \"I told them that England has totally failed in finding any balance between religious [and civil] freedoms.\"</p> <p>The prime minister's office in Jamaica did not respond to enquiries.</p> <h2>Anti-gay laws in the Caribbean</h2> <p>While Jamaica holds the crown for being the worst place in the Americas to be gay, the rest of the English-speaking Caribbean has a long history of homophobia. The British colonial administration entrenched \"buggery laws\" in its colonies, many of which remain in some form.</p> <p>The Bahamas criminalises same-sex activity between adults in public, although not in private. Jamaican, Guyanese and Grenadian laws do not mention lesbianism, but Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Antigua and St Lucia prohibit all acts of homosexuality.</p> <p>Trinidad and Tobago's state-sponsored homophobia extends further through immigration laws prohibiting \"prostitutes, homosexuals or persons living on the earnings of prostitutes or homosexuals, or persons reasonably suspected as coming to Trinidad and Tobago for these or any other immoral purposes\" from entering the country.</p> <p>Although the law is not enforced, there were attempts from Christian groups to prevent Elton John headlining the Tobago Jazz Festival in 2007. Church leaders were worried about the singer's potential influence on the \"impressionable minds\" of the island's young people.</p> <p>Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and the Turks and Caicos islands were forced to repeal their sodomy laws in 2000, when Britain issued an order to its overseas territories, which it had to do to meet international treaty obligations.</p>",
  "<p>Derry's city of culture team have a magnificent view of the river Foyle's west bank and the historic walled city as well as what could be a grand and popular public square \u2013 but one that most residents have despised with passion for decades.</p> <p>The enormous square was a British army parade ground. If you lived locally and did see the inside of Ebrington barracks, which were shielded by ugly corrugated iron and barbed wire, then it was probably for the wrong reasons. The base, used as the army's main barracks during 30 years of the Troubles, closed in 2004.</p> <p>This week there was more of a party feel in the square, the venue for the launch of the \u00a316m programme of events that will make up Derry's year as the first <a href=\"http://www.cityofculture2013.com/\" title=\"\">UK city of culture</a> \u2013 a dizzying list that will include performances by the Royal Ballet, the London Symphony Orchestra and the first staging of the Turner prize outside England. There will also be lots of community arts events. \"We want to take culture out on to the streets, to make it accessible to as many people as possible,\" said the executive programmer Graeme Farrow. \"People will have moments that they will never, ever forget.\"</p> <p>The area is already reaping benefits, although people in the city are taking one bit of news with a large pinch of salt. Lonely Planet this week named Derry as the fourth best city to visit next year after San Francisco, Amsterdam and Hyderabad. \"I don't think we're more interesting than Beijing [fifth], to be fair,\" said Michael Bradley, who was \u2013 and still is \u2013 bass player with the city's best-known musical sons, the Undertones.</p> <p>There must be something about Derry though. When the Undertones started achieving success in the late 1970s there was no question of moving. \"It was always important to us to base ourselves in Derry. It was homesickness and the punk ethic as well. Our manager always used to say: 'You can't go home again,' but I don't think we were ever away from Derry for more than four weeks.\"</p> <p>There was every reason not to go back. \"Anyone who knows about Northern Ireland will say that the 70s were bleak,\" said Bradley. \"And they kind of were.\" Apart from a very big pub quiz scene, \"entertainment had kind of dried up in Derry\".</p> <p>The twice-Turner-prize-nominated artist Willie Doherty is part of the same generation as Bradley and he remembers Derry being a modern art desert until the Orchard Gallery came along in the early 80s.</p> <p>Things have moved on a long way since then and the company behind the city of culture year expect it to be transformative for what is a small and young city \u2013 around 108,000 people, nearly half under the age of 25.</p> <p>Doherty agrees: \"It has the potential to be hugely significant for Derry, if it can be successful in delivering some kind of legacy. There's always the kind of fear with things like this that it brings a lot of excitement and a lot of energy for a year and then it kind of stops \u2013 it's like turning the tap on and quickly turning it off. Hopefully that won't be the case.\"</p> <p>The city has many issues to contend with, not least its violent past. But locals like to assure visitors that the violence is in the past. American tourists wander happily in search of their \"roots\"; the man at the Bloody Sunday museum cheerfully tells a Norwegian tourist that \"Derry is now one of the safest cities in Europe\" over the disturbing soundtrack of the events in 1972 played on a loop.</p> <p>According to Bradley, Derry now has the same problems as any other city \u2013 lack of money, job insecurity and so on. \"It does not have its unique problems.\"</p> <p>The city of culture's former offices have twice been targeted by dissident republicans, first with a pipe bomb in January 2011 and last October with a bomb left outside late at night. No one was injured and 250 people were moved to protest against the attacks.</p> <p>One of the most positive events has been the opening last year of the 312-metre-long pedestrian bridge over the Foyle, the \"Peace Bridge\" between the mainly Catholic cityside and the waterside where most Protestants live.</p> <p>\"I still get excited going across it,\" said Bradley. \"There's a really beautiful park over there and people this side said they hadn't been over in 30 years.\"</p> <p>Shona McCarthy, chief executive of the city of culture company, can easily see the bridge from her office in Building 71 of what was Ebrington barracks. She said it had been \"transformative\" and it is part of her job to take things even further. \"We are all a bit tired of the one-dimensional story. Even at this advanced stage of the peace process journalists still descend on this city if there's a dissident pipe bomb somewhere. There could be five shootings in Dublin in a night and Derry will still get more coverage. We are keen to take this moment over the next year to make a different statement about this place.\"</p> <p>The UK city of culture initiative was born out of the huge success of Liverpool as European city of culture in 2008. It was the embers of the Labour government and the then culture secretary Andy Burnham thought: \"Why not do it ourselves?\" He opened an application process for a UK city of culture which ended with a shortlist of Derry, Birmingham, Norwich and Sheffield.</p> <p>By the time Derry was announced as winner in 2010 the government had changed, but given that there was no money on offer from Westminster \u2013 it's all about leverage \u2013 there was no reason to put a brake on things.</p> <p>The overall cost is in the region of \u00a325m, with \u00a316m for programming. The lion's share, \u00a312.6m, is from the Northern Ireland Executive. \"It is the biggest single investment on this island ever made for cultural programming,\" said McCarthy. \"A total vote of confidence.\"</p> <p>The programme of events next year came out on Thursday. They include a new Sam Shepard play from Field Day, the theatre company set up in Derry 30 years ago by Brian Friel and Stephen Rea; a three-day participatory spectacle devised by Frank Cottrell Boyce called The Return of Colmcille; a \"punk musical\" called Teenage Kicks; and a concert by another Derry boy, the songwriter and performer Phil Coulter.</p> <p>The Turner prize will take place in a smart redbrick barracks building that used to house soldiers.</p> <p>Farrow said it was a huge deal. \"When you are talking about a city of 115,000 people I don't think you can overestimate the effect it will have. One of our aims is to get every schoolchild studying art in Northern Ireland to the Turner prize, getting them there for free and in for free.\"</p> <p>Inspiring a new generation and involving communities is a big part of the year. There is a \"music promise\" to involve more than 7,000 schoolchildren in events with thousands of free tickets.</p> <p>\"This is not the culture company's programme. It's not the city council's programme,\" said McCarthy. \"It is the programme of the neighbourhoods, the community, the education sector and cultural practitioners of this city.</p> <p>\"We've accumulated and curated a programme that creates a balance between genuine authentic cultural representation of this city and major national and international collaborations that lift us out of ourselves.\"</p> <p>What Derry wants to happen is what happened in Liverpool. Some of the rigorously compiled statistics are striking: 66% of residents took part in at least one city of culture event, visitor figures to Merseyside's biggest attractions rose 50%, and tourists flocked in their millions, having an economic impact of \u00a3754m.</p> <p>All the evidence shows that the \"city of culture\" idea works, but only if it is done properly \u2013 something McCarthy is well aware of.</p> <p>She thinks only Glasgow and Liverpool have made \"a radical strategic difference\". She added: \"Some have used it as a moment for absolutely exclusive high-end art.\"</p> <p>Derry is resolutely following the Glasgow and Liverpool model with its ambitions set just as high.</p> <p>Things so far have not been all plain sailing. Earlier this month the project hit the local headlines when the city council took control of the marketing department. McCarthy dismissed it as a \"non-story \u2026 it was just nonsense, just operational stuff, all of us were agreed it was about combining resources and efforts.\"</p> <p>Certainly it does not seem to have dimmed the frantic enthusiasm of the people involved in the company, most of whom are from Derry.</p> <p>There does appear to be a genuine sense of optimism in Derry. Bradley said most people had a wait-and-see mentality. \"I think we'll look back on it as a success,\" he said. \"My theory is that all you have to do is maybe go to three events and you'll think: 'Yes, that was good, I really enjoyed that.'\"</p>",
  "<p>Our legal affairs correspondent, Owen Bowcott, went to Strasbourg last week to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/21/sir-nicolas-bratza-defends-echr\">interview outgoing president</a> of the European court of human rights, Sir Nicolas Bratza. His departure, \"tinged with disappointment\", comes after 14 years as the UK's sole judge at the court. He <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/21/uk-undermining-human-rights-legislation\">responds to criticism</a> directed at the Strasbourg court and the ECtHR by the home secretary, Theresa May, and the lord chief justice, Lord Judge: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"Last month, Judge said legal holdups were 'a source of real fury to me' and in reference to [Abu] Hamza added: 'I do not think \u2026 you will discover that the delays in that particular case, or in many like it, are actually to be levelled at the doors of the courts here.'</p> <p>Speaking in Strasbourg, Bratza said: 'I have read what the lord chief justice has to say about it, where he exonerates his own courts and talks about 'the courts here', and the implication is that perhaps the Strasbourg court is to blame. I don't think that's fair if that's the implication.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Bratza also warned that the UK's reluctance to give prisoners voting rights \u2013 in defiance of repeated rulings by the ECHR \u2013 risked damaging the convention system. On Wednesday, the attorney general echoed this sentiment when he told the Commons justice committee that the UK's international reputation would suffer if Britain was seen to be breaking its treaty obligations. However, that didn't stop David Cameron saying that prisoners would not getting the vote under his government a couple of hours later. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/24/prisoner-votes-row-government-respect\">Joshua Rozenberg writes</a> that the prime minister's statement is \"profoundly depressing\", not because of the policy itself but the implicit snub to his senior law officer: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Grieve has already had to suffer the loss of a well-respected deputy, Sir Edward Garnier. Before the attorney general gave evidence to the justice committee, Cameron should have told him that he had made up his mind on prisoner voting.</p> </blockquote> <p>So if the UK doesn't comply with the Hirst judgment, will it have to leave the Council of Europe? Rozenberg continues:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The only state to have done so, temporarily, was Greece under the colonels. We have not come to that yet. The government does not want the UK to leave and the Council of Europe does not want to lose the UK. So perhaps the government is right to think that the worst that will happen to it is condemnation in even stronger terms by the Council of Europe's committee of ministers. No doubt that would be seen as a badge of honour by some Conservative MPs.</p> </blockquote> <h2>JOBS OF THE WEEK</h2> <p><a href=\"http://jobs.theguardian.com/job/4530511/paralegal/\">Paralegal, Howard League for Penal Reform</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://jobs.theguardian.com/job/4530080/legal-compliance-officer/\">Legal compliance officer, Kings College London</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://jobs.theguardian.com/job/4532414/lectureship-in-criminology/\">Lectureship in criminology, London School of Economics and Political Science</a></p> <h2>YOU MAY HAVE MISSED \u2026</h2> <p>The UK supreme court <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/24/birmingham-equal-pay-victory-women-city\">ruled in favour</a> of scores of women who worked at Birmingham city council in a fight for equal pay on Wednesday.

And the Swindon four-piece did quite well, with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/introducing/2011/10/tip_of_the_week_jess_hall_band.shtml\" title=\"\">some love from the people behind BBC Introducing</a> and daytime plays from Fearne Cotton, not to be confused with Fern Britton. Now, a year later, they've changed their name, which is now apparently based on an ambition of theirs to travel the world and mark the places they intend to visit on a globe with daubs of colour (they were this close to calling themselves Daub the Globe). Their sound and songwriting have matured considerably.</p> <p>Their self-titled debut EP is an accomplished piece of work. What stands out at first is Hall's voice \u2013 even in a week when New band of the day has been dominated by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/oct/23/laura-mvula-new-band\" title=\"\">up-and-coming female singers</a>. Not that it's striking or unusual, just that it's one of those voices that will surely make the odd A&amp;R chancer sidle up to her and suggest sneakily that she ditches the band and goes solo. The fact that she writes and produces the material herself in a studio she set up in her parents' garage make this an even more attractive proposition. But there is clearly something that she is able to achieve with her three bandmates, friends since childhood, so all credit to her for sticking to her guns.</p> <p>Actually, it's her voice together with guitarist Alex Hall's that you can hear in perfect harmony all over the Colour the Atlas EP, giving the songs something of the quality of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/the-xx\" title=\"\">the xx</a>. The band say they are influenced by Fleet Foxes, Bon Iver and Iron &amp; Wine, but they sound more English than that, with if anything less of a US country than a UK folk inflection. But such is the deft use of electronics that most of the folk traces are covered with a computer sheen. We had heard that Colour the Atlas were going to be fusing folk with trip-hop \u2013 Swindon isn't far from Bristol and they grew up listening to the latter's music \u2013 and there is some truth in the rumour. It could probably reasonably be argued that Snow, the lead track on the EP, offers a poppy update of that sound, although in this instance the beat is less trip-hoppy than drum'n'bass skippy. Satellites is slower, with sampled hiss and strings providing an affecting context for Hall's soulful warble as she sings her heart out about losing faith following a breakup. Despite the indie setup, this is commercial stuff \u2013 you could imagine Emeli Sand\u00e9 singing this track. The Maker opens with atmospheric keyboards and Hall and Stone doing an Auto-Tuned duet, a sad lament that, given the treatment of the voices and the way they're smothered by synths, could for all we know be about the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2000/dec/14/pressandpublishing3\" title=\"\">defunct music weekly</a>.

  "<p>\"Grandpa Wen,\" China's state media call him. Or \"The Premier of the People\". To many ordinary Chinese, China's 70-year-old premier Wen Jiabao is a series of endearing images \u2013 a grey-haired, bespectacled man playing basketball with primary school children, or bowing deeply to the families of natural disaster victims.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/business/global/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html\" title=\"\">report in Friday's New York Times</a> gave Wen's populist image a makeover. The paper found Wen's family has accumulated more than $2.7 billion (\u00a31.68bn) in assets, much of it from investments in companies that were directly influenced by Wen's position.</p> <p>Analysts say Wen's role as the Chinese Communist party's friendliest face \u2013 a counterpoint to the stodgy, unsmiling bureaucrats that fill its ranks \u2013 has made the disclosure of his family's wealth a deep embarrassment to the leadership.</p> <p>\"Someone like Wen is a very good focal point for the party's overall narrative \u2013 that it's the only vehicle that can maintain the prosperity that the Chinese people have achieved over the last 15 or 20 years,\" said Rana Mitter, an expert on Chinese politics at Oxford University.</p> <p>Wen has made much of his humble origins \u2013 that he grew up in poverty in Tianjin city before getting a postgraduate geology degree in Beijing. His mother, a teacher, raised him amid the turmoil of the Sino-Japanese war. \"The untold suffering in the days of old China left an indelible imprint on my tender mind,\" he told the National People's Congress in 2003.</p> <p>In his 42-year political career, Wen has gained the reputation of an intellectual. He regularly opens speeches with lines from ancient Chinese poets and scholars, expounding on the virtues of perseverance and commitment to duty. While visiting President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda in 2006, he <a href=\"http://www.chinese-embassy.org.za/eng/zxxx/t280214.htm\" title=\"\">improvised a poem</a>: \"Fifty years of journey sharing weal and woe / Brings Chinese and African hearts closer and ever so,\" he said, according to the website of China's embassy in South Africa.</p> <p>He has long been an ambiguous figure for China-watchers. Some say he could be a crusader for reform; others call him a figurehead. He has expressed support for anti-corruption legislation in speeches around the world. He visited Sichuan after a 2008 earthquake thought to have killed 90,000 people and has met migrant workers during labour unrest.</p> <p>When a high speed train crash in the coastal city Wenzhou in June 2011 became a focal point for popular discontent with the speed of China's development, Wen was quickly on the scene. \"I believe related departments will seriously learn a lesson from this incident,\" he said at a press conference after inspecting the crash site. \"If there is any corruption exposed in the investigation, we will handle it according to the law, and the consequences will be severe.\"</p> <p>Yet if Wen has enacted any real political reform, none of it is obvious. After his visit to the earthquake zone, the government harshly cracked down on activists demanding a list of the dead. His goal of improving migrant worker rights has gone largely unrealised. Corruption in China is still endemic, the country's wealth gap yawning, its thuggish state security apparatus stronger than ever.</p> <p>Analysts usually maintain one of two views on Wen, according to Mitter. \"One is that he's been genuinely trying to push for reform within the party, but has been isolated and not been allowed to succeed because of vested interests,\" he said. \"The other is that this is essentially a piece of self-aggrandizement by Wen.\"</p> <p>Analysts debate the importance of a photograph showing Wen standing alongside former premier Zhao Ziyang while visiting Tiananmen Square student protestors in 1989. While some say that Wen's proximity to Zhao \u2013 a staunch reformer who was placed under house arrest after the protests \u2013 shows his sympathy for the students' cause, others say it betrays nothing but a strong survival instinct, an impressive ability to further his career despite a dangerous political association.</p> <p>Wen has scored at least one big victory in his time as premier: he is widely considered instrumental in sacking the Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai \u2013 a charismatic leader with a flair for Mao-era grandiosity \u2013 triggering the party's most dramatic political upheaval in decades.</p> <p>\"The new problems that have cropped up in China's society will not be fundamentally resolved, and such historical tragedies as the Cultural Revolution may happen again,\" he told a political meeting in March, hours before Bo was stripped of his post.</p>",

  "<p>I like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco\" title=\"\">disco</a> as much as the next person, which is to say I like it at night, in moderate helpings, and only when accompanied by spirits. Disco has long been the musical genre to caricature rather than savour, best enjoyed in the background on hazy nights out rather than as a legitimate musical experience. So presented with the opportunity to sit through a two-hour disco documentary at the London film festival, I was a bit circumspect.</p> <p>But from the first bar of that sour-sweet high-octane disco beat, I was hooked. This is because <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/149697/secret-disco-revolution\" title=\"\">The Secret Disco Revolution</a> is no ordinary history lesson about the 70s craze. Rather than simply charting the rise and fall of disco to a thumping soundtrack, the film presents an unexpected school of thought \u2013 that disco was actually a vehicle of liberation, a revolutionary tool used to end the oppression of women and black and gay people in 1970s America.</p> <p>For those viewers who find that theory a bit dubious (mostly all of them), writer and director <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2040170/\" title=\"\">Jamie Kastner</a> offers a neat solution: tell the story of disco through the eyes of its \"revolutionary masterminds\": a sparkly trio waving their hands over a disco ball as they plot the liberation of America's underclass, using unwitting musicians who have no sense of their subversive purpose. This \"cheesy, glittery, over-the-top Mod Squad\", as Kastner himself describes them, gives us something to laugh about, and allows the film's thesis of revolution to be treated with the scepticism it initially deserves.</p> <p>But as you shimmy through the world of disco, you start to believe in its subversive nature. Finding its home in dark nightclubs where class, gender, race and sexual boundaries disappeared completely, early disco was the music that brought people together \u2013 all without the music industry's hegemony over the radio and Billboard charts.</p> <p>Interviews with the original disco DJ <a href=\"http://www.nickysiano.com/\" title=\"\">Nicky Siano</a> and historian <a href=\"http://www.djhistory.com/interviews/alice-echols\" title=\"\">Alice Echols</a> make the premise more believable as well, even if Echols's theories border on the surreal. At one point she brands Donna Summer's 20-minute <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1ArZEFwRsY&amp;feature=related\" title=\"\">Love to Love You Baby</a> as a \"musical critique for the feminist crusade against three-minute sex\". The entire audience laughed in disbelief, but on second thoughts \u2026</p> <p>Meanwhile, the likes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/may/20/popandrock1?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Gloria Gaynor</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thelmahouston.com/\" title=\"\">Thelma Houston</a>, <a href=\"http://www.marthawash.com/\" title=\"\">Martha Wash</a>, KC from <a href=\"http://www.heykcsb.com/\" title=\"\">KC and the Sunshine Band</a> and Kool from <a href=\"http://www.koolandthegang.com/\" title=\"\">Kool and the Gang</a> bring us back to the reality of being a disco musician, recalling riding the wave from being an underground hit to a record-industry product that was made cheap and sold big. None of them see themselves as emissaries of the revolution, but by this point you feel a bit sorry for them for not understanding their political worth. KC takes himself particularly seriously, still bitter at the music moguls who tore him away from funk and pushed him to the beats of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpoI7vK4uvY\" title=\"\">Get Down Tonight,</a> only to be left to the dogs when rock came along.</p> <p>The film reaches its zenith when we meet the <a href=\"http://officialvillagepeople.com/\" title=\"\">Village People</a>. Henri Belolo, the group's co-creator and songwriter, happily acknowledges what everyone assumed \u2013 that yes, the Village People were meant to be a subversive group, a gay icon, a tongue-in-cheek response to the rigid white middle class that so adored them. But put this theory to the People themselves, and all you get are blank, angry stares. Kastner asks: \"Do you see yourselves as performing double-entendres?\" They respond: \"No.\" \"Do you see yourselves as gay icons?\" \"No.\" \"What was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InBXu-iY7cw\" title=\"\">In the Navy</a> about?\" \"Well obviously, it was about being in the navy!\" The film then cuts to a clip of the quintet prancing around on an aircraft carrier for an official US Navy event, short-shorts and body paint barely covering their modesty, the all-male audience nodding along.</p> <p>As Secret Disco Revolution often reminds us, the kings and queens of the era rarely saw the political statement they were making, and it seems with the Village People, their fans didn't either. But change was happening all the same, and you can't help but respect disco's masterminds \u2013 whoever they were \u2013 for coming up with such a clever plan.</p>",

  "<p>If you still prefer real books to electronic gizmos, then Amazon's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/kindle-touch-paperwhite-amazon-reader/dp/B007OZO03M\" title=\"Amazon page\">Kindle Paperwhite</a> \u2013 which has just started shipping in the UK \u2013 is a good reason to think again.</p> <p>Where earlier Kindle e-readers had grey screens, the Paperwhite has a white, frontlit, E-Ink screen with greatly increased contrast, so it comes much closer to the ideal of black ink on white paper. There are some shiny tablets that could almost double as mirrors, but there's no way you can see your face in the flat matt screen of a Paperwhite.</p> <p>The exterior design has also come a long way from the original <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/oct/23/amazon-kindle-uk-review\" title=\"Kindle review\">Kindle</a> with its push-button keyboard. The Paperwhite's body is pleasantly matt and black, with no visible buttons. The only things that break the surface are the tiny on-off button, indicator light, and micro USB port on the bottom edge.</p> <p>Although some people will hanker after a physical \"next page\" button, you can move to the next page just by touching the screen. You can still read one-handed while standing on a bus or train. However, you might need two hands when you want to touch or tap a thin strip of screen down the left hand side, which takes you back a page, or along the top, which calls up the menu. (You can reach all three areas if you are left-handed.)</p> <p>Tablet users will note that you can swipe across the Paperwhite screen to turn pages, but why would you bother when the lightest tap does the job?</p> <p>The menu icons are easy to understand. From left to right, there's a home button, a back-arrow, a lightbulb for setting the light level, a shopping trolley, a magnifying glass for search, and three horizontal bars (like the ones on Google's Chrome browser) for a set of drop-down menu options. These options change according to what you're doing. When reading a book, for example, they include Add Bookmark, View Notes and Marks, and Reading Progress. One option switches from portrait to landscape mode. This is useful for graphical material, though the image quality is rather poor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398425700\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/26/1351264115578/Paperwhite-008.jpg\" alt=\"Paperwhite\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amazon\u2019s Kindle Paperwhite is light and its backlit screen makes it the most comfortable to use ereader on the market right now. Photograph: Amazon</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amazon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The lightbulb menu provides 24 levels of brightness, to cope with a wide range of lighting conditions from sunlight to complete darkness. The backlighting is unusually even across the screen, except for a thin strip along the bottom. At the maximum setting, the screen is very bright, while the minimum takes you back to the bad old days of black-on-grey ereading.</p> <p>The Paperwhite is designed to have the light on all the time. Amazon says: \"a single charge lasts up to eight weeks, based on half an hour of reading per day with wireless off and the light setting at 10.\"</p> <p>One big advantage of e-readers over paper books is that you can change the typeface and font size to suit your preferences. The Paperwhite offers a choice of six typefaces including Baskerville (with serifs) and Helvetica (without). Each comes in seven sizes from roughly 9 1/2 points to about 36 point text, and even the smallest size looks sharp on the 758 x 1024-pixel screen. You can also change the line spacing and margins.</p> <p>An e-reader can also measure your \"reading time\". The Paperwhite notes how often you turn pages and gives you an estimated time left in book. With physical books, you can see if you are close to the end, and the Paperwhite provides a substitute by counting down the hours and minutes to go.</p> <p>The Paperwhite also offers limited parental controls to block access to the somewhat primitive web browser, the Kindle store, and the Cloud where copies of all your books are stored. You can therefore let your kids read books without having to worry about them downloading inappropriate material or ordering tons of stuff from Amazon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398425701\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/26/1351264383004/Paperwhite-side-007.jpg\" alt=\"Paperwhite side\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Paperwhite has no headphone jack or loudspeaker for listening to audio books or playing background music. Photograph: Amazon</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amazon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But while Amazon has improved the Paperwhite's core functionality, some things have been lost. There's no headphone jack or loudspeaker for listening to audio books or playing background music, which you could do with a tablet. Also, the Paperwhite has only 1.25GB of free memory (out of the 2GB total). Amazon reckons this \"holds up to 1,100 books\", but it doesn't leave much room for your own PDF files, Microsoft Word documents, unprotected books etc, which you can load onto the Kindle by emailing them to a special Amazon address.</p> <p>The space problem could be solved if the Paperwhite had an SD memory card slot, but it doesn't. Of course, your books and emailed documents are stored \"in the cloud\" so you can redownload them via Wi-Fi (802.11b/g/n) just by touching them. But if you are often out of Wi-Fi range on beaches, trains, boats and planes, consider stumping up an extra \u00a360 for the 3G version with Amazon's free Whispernet access.</p> <p>So, all round, the Kindle Paperwhite looks like the best e-reader on the market. The problem is, the market is changing. There's a big gulf between a \u00a369 Kindle and a \u00a3250 laptop or a \u00a3400 tablet, but not between a \u00a3109 Paperwhite and a \u00a3129 <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B008GG0GBI/ref=famstripe_kO2\" title=\"Kindle Fire\">Kindle Fire</a> tablet (with \"special offers\"; ie ads), or even a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2012/jul/13/google-nexus-7-review\" title=\"Google Nexus 7 review\">Google Nexus 7</a> (from \u00a3170). Indeed, the 3G version of the Paperwhite (\u00a3169) costs \u00a310 more than the Kindle Fire HD (\u00a3159).</p> <p>I put the Paperwhite next to my Nexus 7 running Amazon's free Kindle app and there's not that much in it. The Nexus 7 is pretty good for reading novels, and considerably better for reading newspapers and magazines, browsing the web, listening to music, watching movies, playing games and so on. Of course, the Nexus 7 is a lot heavier and it has a much shorter battery life, but it does a lot more.</p> <p>I've not had a chance to try a Kindle Fire, which is Amazon's entry-level tablet, but its Kindle app does much the same job as the Paperwhite. It's a bit bulkier and almost twice as heavy (400g v 213g), but it has more storage (16GB v 2GB), a bigger colour screen (7in v 6in), and multimedia features the Paperwhite lacks. You can see why Amazon now feels the need to offer both.</p> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Light weight and long battery life make the Paperwhite almost perfect for reading novels and other long-form literature on the move, and its illuminated screen means you can read comfortably in bed. Books download quickly. It looks good and feels well made.</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> No colour, no sound, limited storage and no expansion facilities. Only \u00a320 cheaper than a Kindle Fire tablet.</p>",
  "<p>I've always enjoyed short stories; a little escape to get you through a commute. After finishing a collection of Hemingway's shorts I've been looking for something to move on to, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19002044\">opinionsLtd's thorough review of Nathan Englander's What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank</a> convinces me that this should be top of my list. This is Englander's return to the short story form and the \"book is a success\", containing \"a diversity of styles, bite-sized history lessons, colorful characters [with] politics shaping the background.\" Stories full of humour (\"Peep Show\", for instance, which as opinionsLtd explains, \"follows a normally virtuous husband into a surreal striptease club. The story leaves reality on the streets. But after each improbable scene, I wanted more\") sit alongside tales that expose the darkness of human nature, such as \"Camp Sundown\" (\"aged Holocaust survivors at a pensioner summer camp\"). It is a book, says opinionsLtd, which is not only \"funny\" but \"thought-provoking and insightful\".</p> <p>Another warm recommendation came for a novel by William Trevor. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18963615\">Jonathan Went was won over by Other People's Worlds</a>, \"the 10th of his 18 novels and novellas\", which simply \"beckons readers to come \u2026 this near peerless storyteller has created a morally unassuagable universe in which a conniving fabulist blackly wends his way into the lives of those unfortunate enough to meet him. Deception may be easily cast but the pain sewn is nearly always tragic.\" This sounds intriguing; I'm going to have to find myself a copy.</p> <p>Finally, we at the Guardian welcome people and authors from all walks of life, so if instead of curling up with a book to fill the lengthening evenings you feel like trying your hand at a bit of stuffing then Mike Gadd's Beginner Taxidermy: Small Mammal may well be the book for you. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18990337\">It's certainly the book for IsobelH</a>; she writes that \"It really is almost as good as having Mike standing beside you and teaching! I can highly recommend this book to anyone who is starting out in taxidermy \u2013 whether you have already tried mounting a couple of squirrels or if you have never done one before, this book is invaluable.\" I can't say I've tried mounting squirrels before, IsobelH, but it's good to know which book I should reach for should the mood take me.</p> <p>As always, if your review has been been mentioned, get in touch with Sarah Crown on sarah.crown@theguardian.com and she'll be sure to find you a treat from the cupboards. Meanwhile, enjoy your weekend and don't forget to change the clocks.</p>",
  "<p>142 Rue de Montmartre is a fairly innocuous-looking building on a fairly innocuous-looking Parisian street. There's no facade, no neon logo, no clue as to what happens inside; just a black wall with a door, next to a 24-hour supermarket on one side and a key cutters on the other. It's basically a multicoloured beaded door curtain away from looking like a Soho sex shop. What it is, in fact, is Silencio: Paris's first private members club, designed by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/davidlynch\" title=\"\">David Lynch</a>, and based on the club that appears in his 2001 cinematic headfuck, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/90677/mulholland.drive\" title=\"\">Mulholland Drive</a>.</p> <p>\"We are a very long way from home,\" whispers <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/polica\" title=\"\">Poli\u00e7a</a> frontwoman Channy Leaneagh, surveying her surroundings from a stage framed in gold and bookended by blood red velvet drapes. She means it literally \u2013 she lives in Minneapolis \u2013 but also metaphorically. Just over a year ago, Channy and her band (bass player Chris Bierden and drummers Ben Ivascu and Drew Christopherson) barely knew each other; <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/boniver\" title=\"\">Bon Iver</a> was yet to call them the best band he'd ever heard; SXSW had yet to fall completely in love with them; and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/jayz\" title=\"\">Jay-Z</a> hadn't premiered one of their videos on his blog.</p> <p>Recorded in just two weeks and written instinctively following the demise of Channy's marriage, Poli\u00e7a's debut album Give You The Ghost is a sometimes violent near-celebration of the end of something monumental, all wrapped up in guazy, claustrophobic post-rock R&amp;B. It's not hugely surprising that the lyric Channy couldn't get out of her head when writing the album was \"don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me\" from Jai Paul's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEjYt2qNwmg\" title=\"\">BTSTU</a>; that track's similar mix of fragility and aggression is at the core of Poli\u00e7a songs Form and the crushing Happy Be Fine.</p> <p>\"It sort of makes me feel vulnerable and maybe embarrassed to sing those songs, but it was a really dark time in my life,\" Channy says, enjoying a cocktail before the show. \"I was feeling pretty shitty and very sad, so I think that although these songs aren't necessarily biographical it's more the feeling of being confused about who is the enemy and who is the victim and really wishing that the person you've hurt would just kick you in the face so that you could maybe even things out a little bit.\" Blimey.</p> <p>The split was compounded by the fact that Channy and her husband, local musician Alexei Moon Casselle, were also both in Roma Di Luna, a successful folk band that grew out of the pair's early days spent busking in Minneapolis. \"We started the band in 2006 and during that time I had a baby,\" she explains. \"That meant our marriage became the band, and it was my first time being in a band and my first time being married.\" As their success grew, the band's dynamic shifted. \"My husband was always more of the performer. I toured with him, I drove and sold merch. Then all of sudden more and more I was becoming the frontperson. It was a strange switch in roles and it sort of screwed things up a little bit.\"</p> <p>As the relationship and the band were coming to an end, Channy was encouraged to work with local maverick Ryan Olson who was assembling a troupe of musicians \u2013 25 to be exact \u2013 for his latest project, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/mar/30/new-band-gayngs\" title=\"\">Gayngs</a>. Olson had been a fan of Channy's for a while and was keen to get her to add backing vocals to the album he was masterminding. Having been pushed to the front with her old band to the detriment of her marriage, she jumped at the chance to fade into the background. \"It was a place where I could learn a lot and not really be noticed,\" she says. \"I remember some guys would be like, 'Oh, is Channy still in the band?' It was a place for me to slip back and observe.\"</p> <h2>'We got stuck in the snow in the mountains in Colorado\u2026 There was no phone service. The guys all pushed and I was just sat crying in the corner. It was scary'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://player.muzu.tv/player/getPlayer/a/26082/vidId=1282201&amp;la=n\"> <object width=\"460\" height=\"369\" id=\"muzuplayer-26082\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://player.muzu.tv/player/getPlayer/a/26082/vidId=1282201&la=n\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://player.muzu.tv/player/getPlayer/a/26082/vidId=1282201&la=n\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" wmode=\"transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"369\" name=\"muzuplayer-26082\"></embed></object><br /><a href=\"http://www.muzu.tv/nme/polica-lay-your-cards-out-music-video/1282201/\">NME - Polica - 'Lay Your Cards Out'</a> on <a href=\"http://www.muzu.tv/\">MUZU.TV</a>. </figure>  <p><br><a href=\"http://player.muzu.tv/player/getPlayer/a/26082/vidId=1282201&amp;la=n\">Reading this on mobile?

I think he knows when people are ready for things and who they fit well with.\" Encouraging Channy to start a new band, he played her some old beats he'd made that hadn't ever come to anything. Channy picked her favourite 12 and started writing melodies, instinctively coming up with lyrics in his tiny studio-cum-living room. Having recorded using a vocal processor called a Helicon 5 in Gayngs, Channy was keen to continue experimenting with it, it's ghostly effect giving her songs a strange otherworldliness.</p> <p>Much has been made of the use of vocal effects on Poli\u00e7a songs and Channy bristles slightly when I suggest that the vocals become another instrument rather than something to sing along to. She sighs: \"I don't pronounce my words when I'm singing. I'm not a singer-songwriter. But the lyrics are so important because they help me have the right emotion on stage.\"</p> <p>Give You The Ghost was written and recorded during a heatwave and mainly at night, a clammy, nocturnal feel seeping into the fabric of the songs. \"The album's night as hell for sure,\" the laconic Olson tells me from his home in Minnesota (he doesn't travel with the band and rarely gives interviews). \"Channy would come over at about 9pm and she'd stay until about 2am, which for her is like being up for 48 hours. She's definitely a mum, and I'm trying to stay as sterile as humanly possible.\" Once the framework for the songs was finished, Olson personally hand-picked the rest of the band, selecting local musicians he admired. It was his decision to not include a guitarist because he reckons they're \"just embarrassing\".</p> <p>With gigs booked almost immediately, there was little time for Channy, Chris, Ben and Drew to get to know each other. When did they start to feel like a proper band of friends? \"Definitely when we got stuck in the snow in the mountains in Colorado on the way to a show,\" Channy remembers. \"We were hugging each other, like 'Oh my God, we survived!'

It was scary.\"</p> <p>In many ways, Poli\u00e7a are a manufactured band, assembled by a svengali-like figure who gets final say on videos and sends his devotees off to tour the world while he stays at home. \"I think it's helpful,\" Olson says of his governing role. \"There's a thing that can happen in bands where compromise can make the worst decisions, where no one's happy.\" So, is Channy happy?

  "<p>In 1992 the late Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese former leader and father of \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\", said: \"Let a part of the population get rich first.\" He did not explicitly assign that leading role to the Chinese Communist party, but the party, which continues to insist on its exclusive right to rule and its vanguard role in Chinese politics and society, took Deng's instructions to heart.</p> <p>Deng's reforms \u2013 economic liberalisation combined with the party's unchanging grip on China's politics, law, machinery of state, security apparatus, much of its industry and commerce and all of its land \u2013 kickstarted 30 years of rapid economic growth. That brought average per capita income in China up to a still modest $2,425 by 2010. It also facilitated the huge fortunes made by party leaders and their families over the same period.</p> <p>China is on the brink of a leadership change, the infighting for which exposed the accumulated family wealth of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/bo-xilai-trial-neil-heywood-murder\" title=\"\">Bo Xilai, the disgraced former party secretary of Chongqing</a>. Bo now faces a long list of charges, including corruption. But given the overwhelming evidence of the intimate relationship between political power and money in China, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Bo's behaviour, in this respect at least, was not an exception.</p> <p>The party itself has repeatedly stressed that corruption is one of the biggest threats to its continuing rule, but revealing details of the unprecedented wealth enjoyed by leaders' families remains unpopular with the Chinese authorities. Chinese media that do so can face the serious charge of threatening \"social stability\". International media are simply blocked, as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/26/new-york-times-china-wen-jiabao\" title=\"\">New York Times was this week</a> for its account of the fortunes of the family of China's premier, Wen Jiabao ($2.7bn in assets). <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-29/xi-jinping-millionaire-relations-reveal-fortunes-of-elite.html\" title=\"\">Bloomberg Business News was similarly blocked</a> for an account in June of the family wealth of Xi Jinping, the man expected to become China's president in November, a relatively modest $136m. Xi once advised colleagues in the Communist party to \"rein in your spouses, children, relatives, friends and staff, and vow not to use power for personal gain\".</p> <p>Wen's image as a benign and caring leader \u2013 he is popularly though sometimes satirically referred to as Grandpa Wen in China \u2013 has been honed over the years by regular TV appearances at moments of national trauma. He has comforted earthquake victims and apologised for breakdowns in the train service. He has also made statements in support of political reform, though no progress has been made under his leadership. Wen's family has not yet been implicated in any of the scandals of conspicuous wealth and jetset lifestyles that regularly fuel the resentment of the less fortunate majority.</p> <p>But the mechanisms by which Wen's wife and son built up their eye-watering portfolios are routinely discussed around Beijing dinner tables, and accounts of his and other leadership family fortunes have been published, in Chinese, in Hong Kong. The fact that Wen's wife, son and even his 90-year-old mother have swiftly grown spectacularly rich is not a big surprise in China.</p> <p>The symbiosis of politics and money extends to China's parliament, the National People's Congress which, as the <a href=\"http://www.hurun.net/usen/Default.aspx\" title=\"\">annual Hurun report on China's rich</a> has shown, is now a billionaires' club: the wealthiest 70 members enjoy a combined net worth of $85bn. By way of comparison, the estimated combined net worth of 660 top US officials, including the president, reportedly adds up to a mere $7.5bn.</p>",
  "<p>Threaten it with closure. Slash the budget. Let some of its longest-serving stars leave without so much as flinching. As sinking ships go, BBC Asian Network was taking the Titanic approach to a dignified exit: snap your lapels and keep the music playing \u2013 there are still standards to maintain. Plus, if you kept your head above water long enough, who knew what might happen? You might find a way to stay afloat.</p> <p>Which, in a sense, is what BBC Asian Network has done in the last couple of years. While its fellow station, 6 Music, survived with the help of a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/jul/05/bbc-6-music-saved\" title=\"\">high-profile media campaign</a>, this <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/mar/03/asian-network-campaign-save\" title=\"\">less fashionable niche cause</a> seems to have stemmed the tide through sheer bloodymindedness; 34% of the budget has gone. Five broadcasting bases have shrunk to two: Birmingham and London. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/aug/22/citizen-khan-sitcom-star-born\" title=\"\">Adil \u2013 AKA Citizen Khan \u2013 Ray</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/feb/13/bbc.radio?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Sonia Deol</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/asiannetwork/nikki_bedi/\" title=\"\">Nikki Beddi</a>, all star talents who cemented their careers at the station, have moved on. For better or worse (and it depends on who you ask), Vijay Sharma \u2013 the driving force behind turning the Asian Network from five hours a week of programming on BBC Radio Leicester back in the 70s, to a 21st-century operation \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/jan/18/bbc-asian-network-vijay-sharma\" title=\"\">also left the network this spring</a>.</p> <p>And yet, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/oct/25/chris-moyles-radio-one-today\" title=\"\">the latest Rajar figures</a> show 584,000 listeners are tuning in each week, rising steadily each quarter and up from 507,000 last year. That's around a fifth of all British Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Sri Lankans, comfortably making it the country's No 1 South Asian station (there are around a dozen). A new schedule <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2012/new-asian-network-schedule.html\" title=\"\">was launched on Monday</a> because, this weekend, BBC Asian Network also celebrates its 10th birthday as a national, digital broadcaster.</p> <p>Have things finally gone right?</p> <p>Once, Asian Network was the preset of choice for first generation parents tuning in for a couple of hours of <em>filmi</em> hits and <em>desi</em> chatter every week. The station has since set itself the mammoth task of chasing second-, third- and fourth-generation British Asian audiences, too. This, plus an existing remit to appeal across socio-economic and religious divides puts it in a bizarre place in an industry defined by much narrower targets. Who, after all, enjoys listening to the same radio station as their parents? And since when did a nostalgic fondness for AR Rahman also extend to a taste for Punjabi R&amp;B mash-ups? It's tricky territory.</p> <p>And so, the new format bedding in this week has seen a slight reduction in specialist language programmes \u2013 the few shows broadcast in Punjabi, Hindi, Gujarati etc \u2013 which pull in a core of loyal listeners. DJs Tommy Sandhu, Nihal, Noreen Khan, Bobby Friction and Ray Khan are all still on air, but with longer slots to fill. And from midnight to 6am, Asian Network links up to a Radio 5 feed instead.</p> <p>It makes a kind of sense, even if now the Asian Network seems a little less about housewives calling in to request an old Bollywood classic, or retired folks shooting the breeze. But just as the country's demographic has changed over the last 20 to 30 years, so has the station's MO.</p> <p>The trick, says Nihal , is \"never to patronise anyone\". I sit in on his phone-in show on its very first day in the rejigged format. Conversation is lively \u2013 Sony judges described him as \"quite simply brilliant\" when he scooped gold ahead of shows on Radio 4 and the World Service. Topics include British trade talks with the controversial chief minister of Gujarat, NHS care for pregnant women, and the death of Indian film icon Yash Chopra. The chat is stapled around a playlist of Bollywood, bhangra and Brit-Asian fusion.</p> <p>But Nihal, also a Radio 1 DJ, is a deft operator. Last year, he invited the EDL's Sikh spokesman, Guramit Singh, in for a debate. (According to the team, <a href=\"http://www.sikhsangat.com/index.php?/topic/59014-bbc-asian-network-in-trouble-over-holy-prophet-comments/\" title=\"\">that show provoked the year's second-highest number of complaints to Ofcom</a>.) He has talked about everything from child abuse to integration and strip clubs.</p> <p>Predictably, the station has been accused at one time or another of bias against each of the communities listening in \u2013 Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus. But just as it's true that no A-list star from the Indian subcontinent would dare make a promo trip to Britain without dropping in for a chat, so the internal reviews into neutrality help keep the station in check. The station has secured its future with the BBC Trust, but quite what that looks, or in fact sounds, like is continually developing \u2013 which is, I think, a good thing.</p> <p>You might well argue that the station's very existence is a lesson in the failure of multiculturalism. But these shows are uniquely British, broadcasting to multiple generations of British listeners. It's nothing short of an integrated success.</p>",

  "<p>A victim of the mining industry's machismo culture? Up to a point. It's true that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/26/anglo-american-cynthia-carroll-step-down\" title=\"\">Cynthia Carroll, throughout her six years at the top of Anglo American</a>, never shook off the \"outsider\" label. Even at the high point of her reign, rivals whispered - always in vague terms and in private - that Carroll might not be made of the right leadership stuff. The prejudice was always that she had a lot to prove.</p> <p>But look at records elsewhere. Tom Albanese at Rio Tinto and Mick Davis at Xstrata had to tap their shareholders for funds via rights issues after the greatest bull market for commodities in a generation. Those crimes against investors received considerably softer treatment. Anglo merely suspended dividends for a while after the pop in commodity prices in 2009.</p> <p>That said, the reasons for Carroll's departure are not vague. Shareholders have a long list of understandable complaints: a weak share price; slow copper production; delays to a huge iron ore project in Brazil; over-spending on acquisitions; and the unresolved <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/05/south-africa-miner-dies-anglo-american\" title=\"\">corporate nightmare of strikes, lay-offs and violence in the platinum mines in South Africa</a>.</p> <p>That collection of disappointments, however, should be set against the reality that Anglo American, circa 2007, was a hellishly difficult organisation to run. The twin power bases in Johannesburg and London pulled in opposite directions. The company carried its colonial baggage awkwardly and its safety record was appalling: the 2006 annual report recorded the death of 44 employees and contractors.</p> <p>In all those areas, Carroll has made improvements, preaching a once-alien gospel of community engagement, emphasising safety (though 17 deaths last year were more than in 2010) and attempting to tidy up the portfolio of assets by, for example, buying 100% control of De Beers.</p> <p>But the charge that Anglo has thrown capital around too casually is broadly accurate. Carroll's first big move was to buy the Minas Rio iron ore project in the Brazilian rain forest, an enormous mine requiring the construction of a new port and a 325-mile pipeline. The project is at least three years behind schedule, bogged down by permit and construction wrangles. Deutsche Bank's analysts estimated last month that Minas Rio has destroyed $5.5bn (\u00a33.4bn) of value for Anglo shareholders.</p> <p>Then there is platinum problem in South Africa. Prices are weak and the industry suffers over-capacity. There is no obvious way to satisfy the competing demands of South African politicians, the unions and Anglo's shareholders. One fear is that the saga is sliding towards nationalisation. Carroll will leave that challenge to her successor.</p> <p>He (as it probably will be) will face a question that dogged Carroll on her arrival: would Anglo be worth more if it was broken up into pieces? As it happens, dismembered is probably not the answer. There would be buyers for the best assets, such as copper, but real value will only be created when the huge South African problems are resolved. The country is simply too important to the company.</p> <p>Alex Vanselow, who departed BHP Billiton as finance director this year in search of a chief executive's job, has the virtue of being available now. But, if it's not Vanselow, a hunt will take time and a power vacuum at the top is the last thing Anglo needs given the pace of events in South Africa. Time for chairman Sir John Parker, ultimately responsible for succession, to demonstrate that there is a plan.</p>",
  "<p>Unless you work with it on a daily basis, big data is relatively unknown, both as a term and a concept. Even among industry experts its definition is the subject of intense debate. To some the key characteristic is a database's volume, to others it is its complexity, or even the speed at which data is gathered and analysed.</p> <p>To you and I, big data is probably best understood as the enormous datasets held by corporations, governments and other large organisations whose activities affect millions of people. Big data is used to determine your recommended friends on Facebook, suggested purchases on Amazon and the point at which your mobile phone network offers you a freebie to keep you on side.</p> <p>Some of these datasets, such as details of every one of a retailer's sales, will have a consistent format, with others stored as unstructured text. While it can be easy to dismiss big data as overly corporate, irrelevant outside the business world, it is becoming increasingly clear that it can be - and is being - a force for good in the wider world.</p> <p>Below are some examples.</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Fraud detection</strong></h2> <p>Tax fraud is a growing concern for governments looking to cut their deficits, and big data is being used to increase the efficiency of fraud detection processes. Where privacy law allows, government departments can now cross-reference tax databases with other information such as vehicle registrations and overseas travel data to find individuals whose spending patterns and tax contributions do not add up. While a suspicious result is not direct evidence of fraud and cannot be used to incriminate an individual, it can help officials better target their auditing and other checks and procedures.</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Healthcare and medicine</strong></h2> <p>The mapping of the human genome is widely regarded as one of the most significant advances in the history of medical research. The ability to map a person's genetic profile now allows doctors and scientists to predict a patient's susceptibility to certain diseases and other adverse conditions, and the major reductions in the time and cost of carrying out the procedure would not have been possible without big data.</p> <p>Improvements in the speed and functionality of data collection, storage and analysis tools have lowered the cost of sequencing from almost \u00a32bn to around \u00a32,000 today, and cut the time it takes from over a decade to a week. While more incremental gains would have taken place at any rate, such major strides have only been made achievable by the cloud computing services offered by - among others - Microsoft, Amazon and <a href=\"http://www.teradata.com/\">Teradata</a>.</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Humanitarian efforts</strong></h2> <p>The United Nations launched <a href=\"http://www.unglobalpulse.org/\">UN Global Pulse</a> in 2009 with the primary aim of using best practices in the big data industry to enable the organisation to make faster and better informed responses to humanitarian crises. A project using social media analysis to <a href=\"http://www.unglobalpulse.org/discoveringtrendsinbigdata-CHguestpost\">track public concerns in Indonesia and the US</a> has already showed the value such methods hold for crisis response and social science research as a whole.</p> <p>There are a number of other organisations working towards similar goals, including <a href=\"http://datakind.org/\">DataKind</a>, whose founder Jake Porway led a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/oct/03/datakind-london-data-dive\">'DataDive' earlier this year in London</a>, where data scientists collaborated with charities to offer analysis-driven solutions to recurring problems.</p> <p>US organisation <a href=\"http://www.awhere.com/en-us\">aWhere</a> is carrying out similar work, and in one of flagship projects uses data from satellite imagery to <a href=\"http://www.awhere.com/en-us/mosquito-abatement\">find and map pools of stagnant water</a> in developing nations that could become breeding grounds for malaria-carrying mosquitos.</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Privacy</strong></h2> <p>These datasets often contain detailed and potentially revealing information about us, giving rise to concerns over the implication for privacy, and this an issue taken seriously by firms working with big data.</p> <p>US firm Teradata, for example, impresses upon its data scientists that simply obeying privacy laws is not enough - they should take Google's 'don't be evil' motto one step further, using their work to make a positive change.</p> <p>This ideology was yesterday given substance when leading British data scientist Duncan Ross launched the <a href=\"http://www.causes.com/actions/1694321\">'Doing good with analytics' pledge.</a> Signatories commit to taking account of the potential wider impacts of their analysis and to using their skills to help those who could benefit the most.</p> <p><em>Full disclosure: I spent the last four days in Washington DC attending the Teradata Partners' Conference at the expense of Teradata Europe, Middle East and Asia.</em></p> <h2>NEW!

Who cares about whether you get health insurance, and specifically whether you get birth control. The consequences are huge.

Because this is what Obama thinks of your daughters.\"</p> <p>But wait: this ad, plainly, is aimed at women in their early twenties, who don't have voting-age daughters. Who mentioned daughters?</p> <p>Oh, it was John Nolte, Breitbart's editor-at-large, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NolteNC/status/261610193899630592\">who demanded on Twitter</a>: \"How could a president with two young, blossoming daughters\u2026\" Actually, on second thoughts, let's leave that disturbingly creepy observation right there.</p> <p>\u2022 What dark secrets, one wonders, might be exposed by the publication of a new \"angry tell-all\" memoir, written by a disaffected former aide of Joe Biden's? That he harbours a burning hatred of trains? That he's never set foot in Scranton, Pennsylvania? That his mother did not, in fact, sit him down at their kitchen table and say \"Joey, now listen to me,\" followed by a folsky version of whatever message the Obama campaign happens to be emphasising on any given day?</p> <p>None of the above, sadly. The Payoff, by a former Senate staffer named Jeff Connaughton, paints the vice-president as an \"egomaniacal autocrat\" who sometimes swears angrily at his assistants, all of which suggests, troublingly enough, that Biden may be a politician. The juiciest detail concerns Biden's clunky observation, on the 2008 campaign trail, that Obama would \"be tested\" early in his term by foreign enemies. \"Biden told us that Obama had called him and told him sharply that he didn't need public tutoring,\" Connaughton reports, quoting the president as telling his deputy: \"I don't need you acting like you're my Henry Higgins.\"</p> <p>Biden's response, the way his Connaughton tells it, was this splendidly Bidenesque observation: \"I'm going to have to earn his trust, but I'm not going to grovel to this guy. My manhood is not negotiable.\" Perhaps this helps clarify Obama's reference to Biden, in the final debate, as \"my current vice-president\"? Enough snippiness, guys! When I was a kid, growing up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, we'd have settled this with a simple old-fashioned knife fight.</p> <p>\u2022 In a game-changing development, the singer Meat Loaf has made his first ever political endorsement, backing Mitt Romney for president because of\u2026 well, because of storms. </p> <p>\"There has storm clouds come over the United States,\" Loaf -- that's his surname, right? -- told an Ohio rally, as quoted with mean-spirited precision by the Los Angeles Times. A terrifying storm is indeed headed America's way in the coming days, in the shape of Hurricane Sandy, but Loaf was speaking in metaphors. \"There is thunderstorms over Europe,\" he went on. </p> <p>\"There are hailstorms, and I mean major hailstorms, in the Middle East. There are storms brewing through China, through Asia, through everywhere.\" </p> <p>And Romney, he explained, was the man to quell those storms. Meat Loaf ought then to have presented the Republican with a special Romneyfied version of his most famous album, entitled Bat Out Of Heck, but did not.</p>",

Reading the <a href=\"http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s32592/ Appendix%201%20Investing%20in%20Council%20Housing.pdf\" title=\"\">Southwark housing commission report</a> published last week, I was struck by how little the issues had changed.</p> <p>Most of the commission's recommendations are not controversial, nor are they new. Southwark needs to improve its core housing management service, in particular repairs and maintenance, and become more responsive to its tenants and leaseholders. The scale of investment required is huge: 18,000 of the council's 39,000 homes do not meet decent homes standard and, without major refurbishment, many will soon reach the end of their useful life \u2013 the legacy of poor building standards and maintenance.</p> <p>There is though a divergence of opinion about whether Southwark should divest itself of much of its stock. The commission looked at three future options: stock remaining at 39,000; being reduced to 30,000; or being reduced to 20,000. The report's weakest point is its consideration of what would happen if the stock is nearly halved. Who would buy it? What would happen to the tenants? And would the stock remain available to meet housing need?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/editors-blog/2012/oct/19/ southwark-housing-crisis-at-large\" title=\"\">Hannah Fearn's blogpost</a> last week came down on the side of a divestment strategy that would enable investment through local partners and argued that this would be better than \"struggling on\". However tenants in Southwark have consistently said they want to stay with the council as their landlord and that should be respected. Experience elsewhere tells us that stock transfer business plans almost inevitably involve a major loss of social rented housing \u2013 the most precious resource in housing right now.</p> <p>My reason for optimism is that housing revenue account reform is a potential game-changer in places like Southwark. The council now has choices and much more power over the destiny of its housing stock. It has control of its own rental income and a sizeable borrowing capacity. It has a real opportunity to prepare a genuine (rather than a hopeful) 30-year strategy for its stock and has full responsibility for its implementation. The commission shows that a judicious mix \u2013 of redevelopment in the worst cases, physical improvement in many others, and using borrowing capacity to build new homes to replace those lost through right to buy and demolition, together with a major drive to improve the quality and responsiveness of housing management services \u2013 would be viable and sustainable. Within a pragmatic mix there may be examples where a small scale stock transfer is justified.</p> <p>Social rented homes are becoming so scarce that it is surely right that council leader Peter John has already <a href=\"http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/tenancies/southwark-leader-rules-out-large-scale-sale-of-stock/6524277.article\" title=\"\">ruled out drastic reductions in the stock</a> and reiterated the borough's commitment to <a href=\"http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/development/southwark-plans-1000-council-homes-by-2020/6521866.article\" title=\"\">building 1,000 new council homes by 2020</a>. The commission is right to say that keeping the stock will require \"a step change in the quality of strategic and project management\" and Southwark would probably admit the charge that it has a \"chequered history\" on council housing.</p> <p>But one thing is certain: if selling off half of Southwark's stock is the answer, somebody's been asking the wrong question.</p> <p><em>Steve Hilditch co-edits the </em><a href=\"http://www.redbrickblog.wordpress.com\" title=\"\"><em>Red Brick blog</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/housing/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and best practice to support your career</strong></p>",
  "<p>You can hear it from blocks away: the deafening beat of Pogrom, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/golden-dawn\" title=\"\">Golden Dawn</a>'s favourite band, blasting out of huge speakers by a&#xa0;makeshift stage. \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPigBDg8ydQ\" title=\"\">Rock for the fatherland</a>, this is our music, we don't want parasites and foreigners on our land\u2026\"</p> <p>It's a warm October evening and children on bicycles are riding up and down among the young men with crew cuts, the sleeves of their black T-shirts tight over pumped-up biceps, strolling with the stiff swagger of the muscle-bound. They look relaxed, off-duty. Two of them slap a&#xa0;handshake: \"Hey, fascist! How's it going?\"</p> <p>Trestle tables are stacked with Golden Dawn merchandise: black T-shirts bearing the party's name in Greek, Chrysi Avgi, the sigma shaped like the S on SS armbands; mugs with the party symbol, a&#xa0;Greek meander drawn to resemble a swastika; Greek&#xa0;flags and black lanyards, lighters and baseball caps. I lean over to talk to one woman stallholder, dressed in Golden Dawn black with thickly kohl-rimmed eyes, but as soon as she opens her mouth a man in a suit strides up: \"What are you writing? Are you a journalist? Tear that page out of your notebook. No, no, you can't talk to anyone.\"</p> <p>Tonight is the opening of the Golden Dawn office in Megara, a once prosperous farming town between Athens and Corinth. The Greek national socialist party polled more than 15% here \u2013 double the national average \u2013 in the June election, when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/07/neo-nazi-golden-dawn-party-greece\" title=\"\">it won 18 seats in parliament</a>. (One was taken up by the former bassist with Pogrom, whose hits include Auschwitz and Speak Greek Or Die.)</p> <p>Legitimised by democracy and by the media, Golden Dawn is opening branches in towns all over Greece and regularly coming third in national opinion polls. Its black-shirted vigilantes have been beating up immigrants for more than three years, unmolested by the police; lately they've taken to attacking Greeks they suspect of being gay or on the left. MPs participate proudly in the violence. In September, three of them led gangs of black-shirted heavies through street fairs in the towns of Rafina and Messolonghi, smashing up immigrant traders' stalls with Greek flags on thick poles.</p> <p>Such attacks are almost never prosecuted or punished. Ask Kayu Ligopora, of the Athens Tanzanian Community Association, whose premises were vandalised by around 80 \"local residents\" on 25 September after police walked away. He's lived in Greece for 20 years; for the first time, he says, he's thinking about leaving. Or&#xa0;Hussain Ahulam, 22, who told me how four men with dogs and a metal crowbar left him bleeding and unconscious by the side of the road as he walked home one day. Or 21-year-old HH, a&#xa0;Greek citizen of Egyptian origin, who was beaten on 12 October by three men with chains as he stepped off the trolley bus, and whose sight may be damaged for good.</p> <p>Or ask <a href=\"https://twitter.com/manolis\" title=\"\">@manolis</a>, a blogger for <a href=\"http://www.lifo.gr/\" title=\"\">Lifo</a> magazine, who on 11 October went to photograph Golden Dawn's attack on a theatre showing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/aug/22/vanessathorpe.theobserver\" title=\"\">Terrence McNally's Corpus Christi</a>, which casts Christ and the apostles as gay men in Texas. He says four or five people surrounded him in front of the riot police, hit him and spat on him, and put a lit cigarette in his pocket. \"A known Golden Dawn MP follows me, punches me twice in the face, knocks me down,\" he tweeted. \"I lose my glasses. The MP kicks me. The police are exactly two steps away.\" Another MP, Ilias Panagiotaros, stood on the sidelines ranting in front of video cameras: \"Wrap it up, you little faggots. Wrap it up, arse-fuckers. You little whores, your time has come. You fucked Albanian arseholes.\" A third, Christos Pappas, was filmed releasing a man from police custody. He is the only one now under police investigation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398419610\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351081796286/HH-a-Greek-of-Egyptian-or-008.jpg\" alt=\"HH, a Greek of Egyptian origin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">HH, a Greek of Egyptian origin, was beaten by three men with chains.

A&#xa0;woman in a long green dress and high-heeled silver mules is choosing a black T-shirt; another asks the price of a Greek flag. Suddenly there's shouting, a thunder of boots on asphalt: 50 yards from the stage, a group of braves have pushed a&#xa0;man off a red motorbike and are kicking and punching him as he lies on the ground. His arms are protecting his head; I can hear the boots go in. No one stirs until an older member calls them off: \"Come back to our space, fellow fighters. The Leader is on his way.\" The Leader, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, squat in a baggy suit, threads his way through the crowd accompanied by the party's spokesman, Ilias Kasidiaris, a&#xa0;former commando with five criminal charges pending, famous abroad <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVH9LlgLSLU\" title=\"\">for assaulting two women candidates on TV in June</a>. On talkshows, Kasidiaris scowls and slouches like a&#xa0;delinquent teenager, but tonight he looks expansive, almost rock star cool. The office door is flanked by men in camouflage trousers, with crash helmets and Greek flags rolled around wooden staves; more stand guard on the balcony and the roof.</p> <p>Standing among the citizens of Megara as Michaloliakos addresses them, I feel as if I've slipped into a parallel universe. As a Greek, I've known these people all my life: middle-aged women with coiffed hair and well-upholstered bosoms, men in clean white shirts and neatly belted trousers. They're the people who run the cafes and corner shops; who work hard every day, often at two or three jobs; who pinch children's cheeks and won't let you pay for your coffee; who were always cynical about politicians' promises. I&#xa0;never thought they could fall prey to fascist oratory. Yet here they are, applauding Michaloliakos as he barks and roars, floodlit against a low white building next to the petrol station. We could almost be back in the 1940s, between the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_occupation_of_Greece\" title=\"\">Axis occupation</a> and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Civil_War\" title=\"\">civil war</a>, when former collaborators whipped up hatred of the left resistance.</p> <p>Michaloliakos has his populism down pat. His message is pride, and purity, and power. He lambasts the other parties for selling out the country, for their lies and corruption, with special attention to the left party, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17980954\" title=\"\">Syriza</a>. Golden Dawn, he says, are the only patriots, the only ones who haven't dipped their hands in the honeypot. He praises Megara, which used to supply all of Greece, \"before we started eating Egyptian potatoes, Indian onions and Chilean apples\". Then he turns to \"the two million illegal immigrants who are the scourge of this country\", who sell heroin and weapons with impunity. \"Voting for us is not enough,\" he says. \"We want you to join the struggle for Greece. Don't rent your house to foreigners, don't employ them\u2026 We want all illegal foreigners out of our country, we want the usurers of the troika and the IMF out of our country for ever.\"</p> <p>After the fireworks and the flares and the national anthem, Efthimia Pipili, 67, gives me her reaction. \"Foreigners have come twice to my house to rob me in the night,\" she says. \"If I&#xa0;didn't have my rottweiler, I'd be dead by now. I&#xa0;used to vote for <a href=\"http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panhellenic_Socialist_Movement\" title=\"\">Pasok</a> [the Panhellenic Socialist Movement]. Last time I voted for Tsipras [the leader of Syriza] because I thought he was different. But Tsipras wants to protect the foreigners. I have \u20ac100 to last for the next three weeks. I owe \u20ac400 to the electricity company; they're going to cut me off. Why shouldn't I be for Golden Dawn, my love?\"</p> <p>Golden Dawn is many things: a party, a&#xa0;movement, a subculture; a&#xa0;vigilante force; a&#xa0;network inside the police and the judiciary. Vasilis Mastrogiannis of the Democratic Left, a former senior police officer turned politician, describes it frankly as \"a&#xa0;criminal organisation\". New Democracy MP Dimitrios Kyriazidis, who founded the Greek police union, calls it a \"political excrescence\". \"Because of my past in the police, I know very well where these people come from,\" Kyriazidis says. \"Most declare their profession as 'businessman'. But one has to pause at that.\"</p> <p>The party's founder and leader, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, served time in the late 1970s for assault and illegal possession of guns and explosives. While inside, he met members of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_military_junta_of_1967-1974\" title=\"\">military junta that ruled Greece from 1967 to 1974</a>, but his political views, as expressed in Golden Dawn, the magazine he started when he was released, were well to the right of theirs. Breaking the boundaries of \"acceptable\" rightwing nationalism, Michaloliakos published paeans to Adolf Hitler, arguing that Greece should have been at the side of the Axis in the second world war. The magazine, its covers periodically adorned with portraits of the F\u00fchrer and his acolytes, served up a weird amalgam of Nazi propaganda, antisemitism, traditional nationalism and pagan fantasy. The party that now courts and counts on the Orthodox church once advocated a return to \"the faith of the Aryans\" \u2013 the Olympian gods \u2013 claiming that Christianity had \"grafted Jewish obscurantism on to the trunk of European civilisation\". In the one interview I was allowed with a Golden Dawn official, MP Panagiotis Iliopoulos told me that, as a young man, the magazine expressed his ideas completely. Have the party's views changed since then? \"Not at all,\" he said. \"There are no neo-Nazi articles in the magazine. Only historical ones.\"</p> <p>Golden Dawn first drew attention in the early 1990s, when the dispute over the name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia fuelled an upsurge of Greek nationalism. It found fertile ground in the anti-immigrant sentiment that spread through Greece with the first wave of migrants from Albania and eastern Europe; it gathered strength as the failures of Greek and European policy turned Greece into a lobster trap for refugees and migrants coming from Asia, Africa and the Middle East. As thousands struggled to survive beside impoverished Greeks in neighbourhoods shattered by the economic crisis, Golden Dawn vigilantes began to \"clear\" Athenian squares with fists and clubs and knives; to storm unofficial mosques; to sell protection to shopkeepers; to escort old ladies to the supermarket. In 2009 the party polled a mere 0.29% in the national election. In 2010, Michaloliakos was elected to the Athens city council; he celebrated his arrival with a fascist salute.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398419611\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351081380943/Golden-Dawn-MPs-008.jpg\" alt=\"Golden Dawn MPs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Golden Dawn MPs.

In June, many voted for Golden Dawn as a protest against the parties that brought the country down: \"I want them in parliament to beat the others up.\" Now they are turning to it because hope is exhausted; because things are out of control and they want someone to take charge; because it's \"doing something\". \"It's not that Greece is going to be saved,\" one voter said to me. \"Greece can't be saved.\" What, then?</p> <p>The Golden Dawn office in downtown Athens is open three evenings a week. Most of the visitors are middle-aged women with dull eyes and sunken cheeks, faces too old for their bodies, hardened, tired expressions. More than 50 come in an hour. Quietly, they ask the bouncers, \"Are they giving out food inside?\" \"Third floor,\" the bouncers say; but most of the women come out empty-handed save for a&#xa0;mauve piece of paper with the Golden Dawn logo on it. There's only enough today for voters from this ward; they'll announce the next distribution on a poster, in the papers, if you phone.</p> <p>Away from the door, Maria Kirimi tells me she's been locked out of her flat with all her things inside since 29 July; the family are crowded at her mother's now, seven people surviving on \u20ac400 a&#xa0;month. \"We're the living dead,\" she says. Isn't she troubled by Golden Dawn's violence? \"The boys in the black shirts are the only ones I'm not scared of. I feel they'll protect me.\" I&#xa0;ask her mother, old enough to remember the junta, what she thinks of their far-right views. \"I heard Michaloliakos say on TV that their sign isn't Hitler's sign but a&#xa0;patriotic one,\" she says, and then looks down at her feet. \"It does upset me a&#xa0;bit. But I haven't heard of anyone else giving out food.\"</p> <p>For the young people drawn into its inner circle, Golden Dawn means much more. Vetta has Celtic crosses on her collar points, a pack of Stuyvesants and a can of Red Bull clutched in her left hand. Her kohl-rimmed eyes dart back and forth as she speaks, but she is open, friendly. The 33-year-old says she helped to \"clear\" Aghios Panteleimon square three years ago and was stunned by people's gratitude. She's a&#xa0;member now, one of 20 chosen each year for their contribution to the cause and given lessons in ideology and behaviour: \"We have to welcome everybody, to be polite but serious.\" There's a dress code for women \u2013 no heels, low-cut tops or bare backs \u2013 and a growing Women's Front, which offers training in self-defence. \"But there's no difference between men and women here. We all sweep and mop. And, yes, the men make coffee.\"</p> <p>The Golden Dawn office in industrial Aspropyrgos is in a flat above an empty garage, next to the old elevated motorway. The stairs are lined with crash helmets, black shields and Greek flags rolled on to wooden staves, ready to snatch up at a moment's notice. The walls are hung with the slogans of Greek nationalism \u2013 \"Macedonia is Greek soil\" \u2013 and a&#xa0;blown-up photograph of Golden Dawn supporters fighting the riot police. Arete Demestika \u2013 six months pregnant, ponytail down to her waist, earrings like black roses \u2013 waxes lyrical in praise of the party: \"It's an attitude, a&#xa0;way of life, it's what's called Greece. It awakens new parts of you and makes you stronger, it arms you with knowledge, it's a secret school. We learn our true history, the lore of the nation, because the Greeks are a superior race. And it's given me my family \u2013 I met my husband here \u2013 and made me feel I'm not alone in the struggle for our country.\"</p> <p>But outside, as the sun goes down, 27-year-old Costas, a black-booted Golden Dawn cadre, slips out from under the rhetoric and speaks in his own words. He's an inspector now in the Eleusis oil refineries, but that's not his vocation. He's a&#xa0;craftsman, a marble carver; he used to work at <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/404\" title=\"\">the Acropolis</a>, but the pay was terrible and you couldn't get a decent contract if you weren't in the right party. His face softens and sweetens as he talks about working the marble, learning the craft as a boy, and I realise that he comes from a&#xa0;village I know well. Suddenly we're two people \u2013 two Greeks \u2013 talking about a place we love, a place full of memories, almost as if things were normal.</p> <p>Deliberately, inexorably, Golden Dawn is moving into the gaps left open by the crippled Greek state. Its strategy is a blend of seduction and extortion, the exploitation of need backed by the threat of violence. To its existing \"solidarity projects\" \u2013 \"Food for Greeks only\" and \"Blood for Greeks only\" \u2013 the party has now added a&#xa0;third: \"Jobs for Greeks only\". Golden Dawn members are visiting workshops and factories, counting and publicising the number of foreign workers there, \"encouraging\" employers to hire Greeks instead. But its biggest success has been the provision of \"security\", with the collusion of the authorities: the intimidation of migrants, protection of Greek shops, vigilante patrols.</p> <p>Adept at spectacle, the party claims new territory with a show of black-shirted strength, fireworks and flares and fanfare, masculine energy. Physical fitness is a big part of its culture. There are Golden Dawn gyms that don't admit foreigners; Golden Dawn security firms. MP Panagiotaros owns a shop called Phalanga that sells military memorabilia; bovver boots and black gloves; ultra football shirts; kit by Pit Bull and Hooligan. Members of the military junta beam from photos on the wall. The heavy stuff is said to be kept in a back room.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398419612\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351082236610/Lawyer-Yianna-Kourtovik-008.jpg\" alt=\"Lawyer Yianna Kourtovik\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yianna Kourtovik acts for victims of racial attacks.

It's common knowledge that if you want to get squatters out of your flat, you call Golden Dawn, not the police, who at best will quietly pass you a Golden Dawn telephone number. The story has become a staple of dinner-party conversation; in the version I heard from unemployed journalist Julia Iliakopoulou, the Golden Dawn heavies who cleared the Pakistanis out of her friend's flat by \"beating them black and blue\" made them clean it up and paint it afterwards. \"Don't upset yourself,\" they said. \"We're Greeks helping Greeks.\"</p> <p>It's hard to measure just <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/oct/26/golden-dawn-greece-police-video\">how deeply Golden Dawn has penetrated the police</a>. In Athens wards where the police vote in large numbers, the party polled 19-24% last summer; Panagiotaros crows that 50-60% of the force is now with the movement. What's obvious is that rightwing violence almost always goes unchecked, even when it happens under officers' noses or on camera. Early in October, anti-fascist protesters told me they had been tortured in the Athens police headquarters: burned with a cigarette lighter; forced to strip naked, bend over and spread their buttocks; filmed by officers who said they'd give the pictures to Golden Dawn. As I&#xa0;tried to interview some of them in a public lobby of the Athens courthouse, an officer grabbed me by the arm and pulled me roughly away. A police spokesperson denied the protesters' allegations.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-398365913\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/25/1351185351838/Golden-Dawn-supporter-015.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/11/7/121025GoldenDawnFinal-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/11/7/121025GoldenDawnFinal-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/121025GoldenDawnFinal/121025GoldenDawnFinal.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/11/7/121025GoldenDawnFinal_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/11/7/121025GoldenDawnFinal_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video>   <p>Lawyer Yianna Kourtovik is familiar with Athens' most notorious police station, Aghios Panteleimon, which in 2010 was censured by a&#xa0;United Nations special rapporteur. She tells me that migrants trying to bring complaints of racist violence are routinely threatened with counter-charges and held in the cells; that local supporters of Golden Dawn wander freely in and out of rooms where complainants are giving statements; that she has had to prevent a friend of accused attackers from removing evidence. \"If that isn't giving cover to Golden Dawn, I&#xa0;don't know what is,\" she says. A few weeks ago, she was egged by Golden Dawn outside the station while the police looked on. Then: \"The other day, as I was walking down the road, two uniformed officers behind me started chanting, just loud enough for me to hear, 'Blood! Honour! Golden Dawn!'\"</p> <p>Why are such allegations never investigated? The usual response from those on the left is that Golden Dawn is \"the long arm of the state\" \u2013 that the government tolerates it to discourage immigration and keep people in a passive state of terror. But Golden Dawn is now much more of a threat to public order than protesters against austerity. There is also the fear of further alienating a desperately underfunded, underpaid and demoralised police force. New Democracy's Kyriazidis has led efforts to isolate Golden Dawn in parliament and, as a&#xa0;veteran union organiser, has intimate knowledge of the old militarised, post-junta police. But when I put the question to him, he hesitates: \"Now that Golden Dawn is a&#xa0;legal party in parliament, we can't do anything\u2026 If there is an investigation, it has to be done internally, to remove individuals who act in this way but not weaken the police as a whole.\"</p> <p>Through some lethal cocktail of intention, incompetence and inertia, the state has let a&#xa0;violent, anti-democratic force take control of law enforcement.</p> <p>Greece has bitter experience of what can happen when the far right infiltrates the security services. But the Democratic Left's Mastrogiannis thinks what is happening now is more dangerous than a&#xa0;coup. \"With the junta, you knew the enemy,\" he says. \"But these people are acting inside society, undermining the system from within. People doubt that democracy is alive. They see it as something that works only for the few, who exploit it to make money. And the circumstances are not transient. This situation could go on for 15, 20 years.\"</p> <p>Already Golden Dawn's success has moved the agenda to the right. Speaking in Paris last month, prime minister Antonis Samaras compared his country to 1930s Weimar. Trying to win back ground before the last election, he launched an ill-thought-out campaign (Xenios Zeus, or Zeus the Host) to round up illegal migrants, and spoke of taking back Greece's city centres. \"I try to tell myself that he meant from criminals,\" says Dr Yunus Mohammadi of the Greek Forum of Refugees, \"but really he meant from migrants.\"</p> <p>People quickly become inured to hate speech and violence. Panagiotaros now speaks openly of a \"new kind of civil war\" between Greeks and \"invaders\", nationalists and leftists. Two years ago, a friend who sits on the Athens city council came in late to find only one empty seat, beside Michaloliakos. He hesitated, but the Golden Dawn leader waved him over. \"Do sit down,\" he&#xa0;said. \"Fascism isn't contagious.\" At the time, we thought it funny.</p>",
  "<p>Sometimes even the most liberal among us need a dose of old-fashioned machismo. It's why that sexist, arrogant \"blunt instrument\" of the British secret service, James Bond, is still popular 50 years after his first cinematic adventure, why hearts leap whenever furrow-browed vigilante Batman takes out the bad guys the cops can't touch, and why Conan the Barbarian is still popular more than 80 years after pulp writer <a href=\"http://www.rehfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Robert E Howard</a> first created the musclebound Cimmerian barbarian.</p> <p>But while 007 and the Dark Knight have seen more than their fair share of decent celluloid adventures, Conan has been poorly treated on the big screen. Of the three movies to star the character, only <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082198/\" title=\"\">John Milius's majestic Conan the Barbarian from 1982</a> is worthy of the name. And that's why today's news that Hollywood is planning a direct sequel \u2013 restoring Arnold Schwarzenegger, no less, to the role which made him famous \u2013 is so inspiring.</p> <p>Reportedly the inspiration for John Goodman's unhinged Walter Sobchak in the Coen brothers' <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/77069/big.lebowski\" title=\"\">The Big Lebowski</a>, Milius <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2001/nov/08/artsfeatures\" title=\"\">once told</a> a Guardian interviewer that he would like to feed progressively minded movie producer Harvey Weinstein to the Taliban. Nevertheless, he was exactly the right guy to shoot a Conan movie. Milius's take, which he mostly wrote himself after excising almost all of Oliver Stone's original screenplay, posits the barbarian as the ultimate self-made man, the epitome of rightwing libertarianism. First seen as a small, orphaned child sold into slavery, Conan literally carves himself out of granite in front of our eyes, progressing from human power station (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMqQA1SUifw\" title=\"\">via the famous wheel of pain scene</a>) to pit fighter and on to free thief and adventurer as the film progresses.</p> <p>With Schwarzenegger in a career-defining role (despite apparently having to repeat his lines up to 40 times or more due to his Austrian accent) and a supporting cast that also included the great Max von Sydow and Japanese-American actor <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mako?from=Main.MakoIwamatsu\" title=\"\">Mako Iwamatsu</a> as wizard Akiro, Conan the Barbarian is an epic, yet strangely minimalist masterpiece. Few words are spoken throughout but those which are uttered have the utmost potency, largely because Milius purloined speeches almost wholesale from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2012/feb/07/political-message-nietzsche-god-is-dead\" title=\"\">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> (\"that which does not kill us makes us stronger\" in the film's opening) and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/blog/2005/apr/18/genghiskhana?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Genghis Khan</a>. When Conan is asked what is good in life, he paraphrases the latter: \"To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of their women.\"</p> <p>The new film is being put together by a team which at first glance does not have half of Milius's pedigree (the latter also wrote iconic lines such as \"Do I feel lucky? Well, do you punk?\" for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/97011/dirty-harry\" title=\"\">Dirty Harry</a> and \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning\" for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/36320/apocalypse.now\" title=\"\">Apocalypse Now</a>.) Producer Chris Morgan, who may well write the screenplay, has been involved in the last four Fast and Furious movies, which, while decent enough action flicks are hardly cult classics of the calibre of Conan the Barbarian.</p> <p>Nevertheless, he and co-producer Fredrik Malmberg are making all the right noises about the new project. \"The original ended with Arnold on the throne as a seasoned warrior, and this is the take of the film we will make,\" Malmberg told Deadline. \"It's that Nordic Viking mythic guy who has played the role of king, warrior, soldier and mercenary, and who has bedded more women than anyone, nearing the last cycle of his life. He knows he'll be going to Valhalla, and wants to go out with a good battle.\"</p> <p>\"After the original seminal movie, all that came after looked silly to me,\" Morgan added. \"Robert E Howard's mythology and some great philosophy from Nietzsche to Atilla the Hun was layered in the original film. People say he didn't speak for the first 20 minutes of the film, but that was calculated in depicting this man who takes control of life with his own hand. This movie picks up Conan where Arnold is now in his life, and we will be able to use the fact that he has aged in this story. I love the property of Conan so much that I wouldn't touch it unless we came up with something worthy. We think this is a worthy successor to the original film. Think of this as Conan's Unforgiven.\"</p> <p>All of which sounds suitably tantalising. But will the new film successfully excise memories of cheesy 1984 sequel <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087078/\" title=\"\">Conan the Destroyer</a>, a hokey quest movie featuring Arnie alongside Grace Jones and Andre the Giant which eschewed the violence and mysticism of the original in favour of a more family-friendly approach, and the recent misfiring <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/143159/conan-the-barbarian\" title=\"\">Jason Momoa-fronted reboot</a>? We'll find out in 2014, when the film is due to hit cinemas.</p> <p>One thing's certain: if Arnie must return to acting, I'd much rather see him playing Conan again in a role which makes use of his age than turning up in cheap tributes to 80s action films that were never all that great in the first place, or desperately trying to pull on that knackered old T-800 outfit one last time. Returning to the role that made him a star feels like the right way to bid a last hurrah to an iconic screen presence without resorting to cheap theatrics. Now all the producers need to do is pull Milius (who hasn't directed a cinematically released feature in 20 years and sees his fall from the grace as part of a leftwing Hollywood conspiracy) off the firing range and give him a say in the movie. Failing that, I hear Clint Eastwood is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/10/beyonce-clint-eastwood-quitting-star-born\" title=\"\">having issues</a> with casting his musical take on A Star is Born. Schwarzenegger directed by the ultimate macho movie hero would represent a fine farewell for both of them.</p>",
  "<p>Now that <a href=\"http://findingada.com/\">Ada Lovelace day</a> \u2013 which seeks to highlight inspirational stories about women in science \u2013 is safely over, I can mention something about it that concerns me. It is a broader concern than this one day, and is basically this: where were the men?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/the-h-word/2012/oct/16/history-science\">As I explained in an earlier post</a>, I am all for seeking out women's stories in history, because it gives us a different and equally important perspective on how science happens. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/the-h-word/2012/oct/19/women-fade-background-wikipedia\">I also showed, in the context of Wikipedia editing</a>, that it is hugely important for women to be making and sharing knowledge. However, I am concerned by the fact that the two things seem so often to have to go together. Women should be writing about women.</p> <p>In fact, men and women should be writing about men and women (and boys and girls, animals and instruments, seas and skies, or whatever). I think it would be hard to disagree with this point, and yet so often we find ourselves positioned against this.</p> <p>I very happily went along last Tuesday to host <a href=\"http://palaeosam.wordpress.com/2012/10/16/ada-lovelace-day/\">an Ada Lovelace special for PubSci</a>, to hear several women speaking about the women in history that helped provide inspiration in their scientific careers. But I would have loved it if there had been one or two men speaking about women too. (Though many thanks to the men who organised and attended the event!)</p> <p>In my academic career, writing about gender is something that has both had an appeal and something I have purposely avoided. After having written my undergraduate dissertation on women in 17th-century drama, I was keen not to find myself pigeonholed as a woman who only wrote about women and found myself for some time focusing fairly squarely on the men of science who formed the core of my postgraduate research.</p> <p>Fairly or unfairly, my sense was that this reinforcement of the view that women's history is by and for women can serve to trivialise both the makers and subjects of that research. It becomes a niche, when it should be an integral part.</p> <p>The same danger can arise when all the work and publicity about bringing women into research/academia/politics/business is delivered by women. If we agree that it is important that female voices should be much better represented in a host of important and influential places, then that is a concern for everyone.</p> <p>That it should be a shared concern is the reason why I do not agree with those (men) who complain about women-only shortlists, training sessions aimed at women, or the need to create \"binders of women\" that can be waved under the nose of politicians suffering female-selective blindness. But these things should be endorsed, created and delivered by men as well as women, until such future time that these particular distinctions cease to hold such significance in the workplace.</p>",

  "<p>Growth in the US economy picked up in the third quarter as Americans went on a shopping spree and government spending surged, with less than two weeks to go before the election.</p> <p>GDP rose by an annualised rate of 2%, up from 1.3% in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said. Wall Street economists had expected growth of 1.9%. However, a growth rate of more than 2.5% is needed over several quarters to bring the unemployment rate down. European shares erased losses after the figures were released. They are the last snapshot of economic growth before Americans go to the polls on 6 November.</p> <p>Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said: \"Thankfully GDP growth came in a little higher than we had feared, largely because of the big jump in federal spending, but the economy is still not growing rapidly enough to create sufficient jobs to reduce the unemployment rate.\"</p> <p>Encouraged by higher share prices and an improving housing market, consumers splashed out on a range of goods including cars and the iPhone 5. Consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of economic activity, grew by 2% compared with 1.5% in the second quarter. The pick-up came despite higher inflation, squeezed incomes and impending cuts in government spending and tax hikes.</p> <p>The worry is that with 23 million Americans out of work or underemployed, this pace of spending will not be sustained.</p> <p>The largest increase in defence spending in more than three years pushed government expenditure up by 3.7% following eight quarters of declines. Federal spending surged 9.6%, adding 0.7% to overall growth.</p> <p>However, companies cut back, with business investment dropping 1.3%, the first decline since the recession ended. The equipment and software industries posted a flat outturn, the weakest performance since mid-2009. Economic growth was also held back by the first drop in exports in more than three years.</p> <p>ING economist Rob Carnell said: \"In the end, what saved this figure from being much, much worse, was a somewhat freakish surge in government spending, driven by a 13% gain in national defence spending. In short, a decent headline, but a fairly poor background picture for domestic demand. The Fed will not be persuaded to trim their quantitative easing purchases on the back of this data, and instead will see further ammunition to expand QE3 to include Treasuries at the December meeting.\"</p>",
  "<p>Jason Roberts' refusal to wear a Kick It Out T-shirt on another day of action for the anti-racism group will grab the attention ahead of this match but Reading's focus is squarely on securing their first Premier League win of the season.

  "<p>This year, <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Death-penalty-focus-shifts-to-costs-3834362.php#page-1\">California's death row</a> will cost taxpayers $184m. What will the state get for that price? The same number of executions as last year, and the year before that, and every year since 2006: zero.</p> <p>A solution has been offered: the state's worst offenders would die in prison of natural causes, just as they are doing on death row today \u2013 only now, taxpayers would save $130m a year. That is <a href=\"http://swampland.time.com/2012/10/22/ballot-initiative-of-the-day-californias-death-penalty-ban/\">Proposition 34</a>, the ballot initiative to replace the death penalty with life in prison without the possibility of parole as the state's maximum sentence for murder.</p> <p>The economic benefit may not be obvious. After all, many people don't know that the death penalty <a href=\"http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty\">is far more expensive</a> than life in prison with no chance of parole. Voters are surprised to learn that every death row inmate comes with a lifelong team of lawyers, is housed to one cell and automatically gets extra security, and even extra visiting hours. Most often, death row inmates die of old age. It all adds up to a very large tab for no useful purpose.</p> <p>The one thing about the death penalty everyone agrees on: the system is broken beyond repair. There is simply no other way to describe spending nearly $1bn over six years in order <em>not to execute a single one</em> of the 726 prisoners currently on death row.</p> <p>Of course, by very definition, justice cannot be only a question of dollars and cents, no matter how staggering the cost \u2013 and this is even more true in matters of life and death. But having served as prosecutors at the highest levels of the legal system and convicted murderers and terrorists, we are confident there are better means of winning justice for victims and society at large than the death penalty.</p> <p>For starters, Proposition 34 directs $100m in savings to law enforcement to solve more murders, 46% of which statewide <a href=\"http://www.deathpenalty.org/article.php?id=666\">go unsolved</a> (the numbers are even worse for reported rapes, which will also be targeted with the saved funds). Under today's shrinking budgets, investigative units could not be farther from the crime labs we've all see on TV. In Los Angeles, police typically must wait <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/22/local/la-me-lapd-fingerprint-20120723\">six to eight weeks</a> for fingerprints from violent crimes.</p> <p>That's more than enough time for leads to disappear or, worse, suspects to strike again.</p> <p>Thankfully, focused funding has been shown to make a difference. Earlier this year, the California department of justice (which processes DNA in 47 of the state's 58 counties) was able to <a href=\"http://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-announces-end-backlog-slowed-dna-analysis\">reduce</a> the time for DNA testing to 30 days from four months, due in large part to investing in lab technology upgrades. Robotics now do in two hours what used to take two days. This is the sort of promise that awaits Californians if death penalty funding is redirected.</p> <p>There is also the matter of accountability. A sentence not carried out is little more than an idle threat \u2013 it undermines the authority of the justice system and provides no closure for victims' families. The contrast here between the death penalty and life in prison is stark. While <a href=\"http://www.safecalifornia.org/news/blog/epic-win-safe-california-act-to-replace-the-death-penalty-will-be-on-the-november-ballot\">only about 1%</a> of California's death penalty inmates since 1978 have been executed, over that same period, every person justly sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole remains in prison or has died there. A sentence of life without parole means exactly that.</p> <p>To be sure, some will argue that the system can be fixed or streamlined to benefit both justice and the budget. In fact, such an approach would be harmful to both. The death penalty process in California could be expedited only by spending more money \u2013 at least $85m per year, <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/20/local/la-me-adv-death-penalty-costs-20110620\">according</a> to a substantive report by federal judge (and death penalty supporter) Arthur Alarc\u00f3n and Loyola Law professor Paula Mitchell.</p> <p>You can't hurry justice without making grave mistakes. Nationwide, <a href=\"http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/innocence-and-death-penalty\">141 people</a> have been freed from death row. That is gratifying and horrifying at the same time: were other innocent people less fortunate? We'll never know. Even prosecutors who apply the highest possible standards know that a fatal \u2013 and irreversible \u2013 mistake is always possible with the death penalty.</p> <p>The only way to eliminate the risk of a wrongful execution is to replace the death penalty with life in prison without parole. It would give California the resources it needs to protect its citizens and to solve more violent crimes. And by actually carrying out the sentences that juries impose, it just might also give victims and families the legal finality and peace they so richly deserve.</p>",
  "<p>Welcome to the last weekend of the regular season. Sporting Kansas City have already secured the top seeding in the East with their victory over <strong>Philadelphia Union</strong> on Wednesday night, but behind them there's a whole mess of possibilities that will determine who we get to watch on Halloween(!) in the Eastern wild card game. The Union can still have a big say on the playoff line ups when they host <strong>New York Red Bulls</strong> on Saturday afternoon. A New York win would depose one of <strong>Chicago Fire</strong> and <strong>DC United</strong>, from their current positions as 3rd and 2nd in the standings, as those two face each other later on Saturday afternoon. <strong>Houston Dynamo</strong> meanwhile are just a point behind New York going into a final day game at a <strong>Colorado Rapids</strong> side with nothing left to play for.</p> <p><strong>Montreal Impact</strong> can still guarantee a decent seeding in next season's Canadian championship with a win over <strong>New England</strong>. Not much but local bragging rights to play for when<strong> Columbus Crew</strong> face <strong>Toronto FC</strong> on Sunday, with the hosts wondering what might have been had they got that late goal instead of DC last week. <strong>FC Dallas</strong> also saw their faint play off hopes depart last week - though the damage was arguably done when they failed to beat <strong>Chivas USA</strong> a couple of rounds ago. The sides meet again on Sunday evening with both looking forward to the end of the season.</p> <p>The only remaining question in the West is which side secures home advantage in the semi-final featuring Real Salt Lake and Seattle Sounders. <strong>Real Salt Lake </strong>host <strong>Vancouver</strong> in one outside permutation for a possible conference final, while <strong>this weekend's Guardian live game features another possible conference final when Los Angeles Galaxy take on Seattle Sounders</strong> in the final game of the regular season. </p> <p>For one last time this year, our cast of fan reps, bloggers, beat writers and podcasters have joined us for a preview of the weekend's action. See what they have to say below, have your say in the comments, and join us for the live game of <strong>LA Galaxy vs Seattle Sounders on Sunday at 9pm ET</strong>, then again on Monday when Joe and I will have 5 Things we learned, and through the week, as the playoffs get under way. </p> <p>Speaking of our contributors this year, some of them will be back with us through the playoffs, while some of them will be showing up again when the season's done and dusted to have their say on how it went for their side. All of them have been extraordinarily generous with their time and contributions this season - and I'd like to thank them for that. Special shout out to Ben Hoelzel from the Crew Union, who just endured playoff elimination for his team and hip surgery in the same week, but still showed up with his preview.

Philadelphia Union vs New York Red Bulls, Sat 1.30pm (NBC, TSN 2)</h2> <p><strong>Scott Kessler</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.brotherlygame.com/\">The Brotherly Game</a>, Philadelphia:</p> <p>John Hackworth has brought an ebb-and-flow approach to results for the Philadelphia Union, and recently that has meant pointless affairs for the team. This week was spent picking the ball out of the back of the net, despite Jack McInerney scoring in four straight games and Antoine Hoppenot adding a goal, bringing his season total up to four. A 3-1 loss to Houston, last Saturday, left Philadelphia reeling after they tried to ride the energy they gained from two consecutive victories previously - and it showed on Wednesday night against Sporting Kansas City. It was another game where the Union were absolutely dominated by a better team in the first half.</p> <p>However, when the second half began, Hoppenot, who had come on for Gabriel Gomez at half time, and the Union looked like a different team. Where Kansas City had been able to apply high pressure and pass where ever they wanted, out of nowhere the Union were closing space and finding room to move. Hoppenot's game tying goal gave the Union some hope of at least taking a point out of Kansas City, but then, in classic Union fashion, they gave up a late goal to cede control of the game and scoreline to Sporting.</p> <p>Philadelphia will host their rival, the New York Red Bulls, on Saturday at PPL Park for the Union's last game of the season. The club has nothing to play for beyond pride and trying to send the Red Bulls into the postseason on a poor note. Prediction: 2-1 Union</p> <p><strong>Brent Gamit</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.empiresupportersclub.com\">Empire Supporters Club, New York</a></p> <p>After all the upheaval with Erik Soler's removal, Hans Backe's statement to foreign media, Wilman Conde's absence due to personal reasons, and Brandon Barklage's injury, a result similar to SKC's last visit to RBA wouldn't have been a surprise last week. Instead, the team came out and fought well, doing their best to score, knowing full well that SKC had parked the proverbial bus in front of net. Jimmy Nielsen's play in goal was phenomenal, unfortunately, constantly frustrating RBNY's attack and die-hard supporters with his acrobatic saves. A 0-0 draw in front of a large and raucous crowd disappointed some, while it gave others some hope.</p> <p>This Saturday, a large contingent of RBNY's supporters will be making the short trip south, knowing that with Conde still absent and Barklage and Lloyd Sam out for the year, the team still needs a result. With some key players in defense absent for this crucial match, it will not be easy. The Union won't lie down and this will be a big game for them and their fans. The expectations for this match are tricky. Most players in attack and midfield will be available. With Sam being out, however, old mainstays like Joel Lindpere and Jan Gunnar Solli will be given the opportunity to play, even though their performances of late have been disappointingly average at best. In defense, the tandem of Markus Holgersson and Rafael Marquez, who did quite well while surprising many against SKC, will have their work cut out for them. Prediction: 1-1 draw.</p> <p></p> <h2>2. Montreal Impact vs New England Revolution, Sat 2pm</h2> <p><strong>Sofiane Benzaza</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.mountroyalsoccer.com\">Mount Royal Soccer</a>, Montreal:</p> <p>What happened last week in Montreal Impact action was probably one of the dullest games in the short MLS history of the 19th franchise. I don't believe Montreal Impact vs Toronto FC to be a derby yet. Not having seen a spark, event, incident or clash of civilizations, I still believe in giving this potential rivalry time and love \u2013 or maybe lack of love. Many do not agree with my very binary view but that 0-0 draw at BMO field did not help.<br> But moving along to the next and last MLS game for the Impact, Stade Saputo will host fans that have been loyal to the club through some low points at its beginnings. The Ultras Montreal group will have a special tifo/banner and game day is tagged \"supporters day\", with interesting fan-centric activities. About the actual game, the 2013 Amway Canadian Championship seeding is still in play and being the best MLS Canadian club is a good honor to have. With an exciting and offensive New England Revolution team coming to Montreal, the game should be entertaining and pride will be in play.</p> <p><strong>Julie Kumor</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.midnightriders.com/\">Midnight Riders</a></p> <p>Last week was the last home game of this god-awful season; last time to see the sad empty stadium, a field with football lines and see the sad New England Revolution play; they were even predicting heavy rain. So, I was pleasantly surprised to find none of that \u2013 it was a beautiful Saturday, the line of cars coming into the stadium was heavy and even the Revs played like the game meant something to them. </p> <p>When it comes to soccer players, I admit I am a size-ist. I like my soccer players tall, big and meaningful, so I am not a big fan of Diego Fagundez. On Saturday, though, against the Fire, he was everywhere on that field and just before he took that shot on goal, the doubter in me shook my head. That was before a goal and for the first time, I was happy to hear that shrill screaming that comes from 12-and-under girls and accompanies Diego's play. The Fire looked like the team whose season was over, not on their way to the playoffs. AJ Soares looked comfortable for the first time in a long time in his center-back position. Blair Gavin got his first runout on the field since the trade when we got him for Shalrie Joseph and I thought he did a decent job moving the ball through the midfield. </p> <p>The Revs did a good job of ending their season on a high note, but the Gillette Stadium crew didn't get the note that it was \"Fan Appreciation Night\" \u2013 before I had even walked away from my seat, they were erasing the soccer field lines from under the already painted-on Patriots lines.</p> <p></p> <h2>3. Chicago Fire vs DC United, Sat 4pm (NBCSN, TSN 2)</h2> <p><strong>Dan Martin</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.section8chicago.com/\">Section 8</a>, Chicago:</p> <p>The only way I can describe the Fire's game at New England is as a \"complete loss\" \u2013 the opposite of the oft-referenced \"complete win\". The team came out flat, seemingly without inspiration. I hoped for half-time changes, some sort of a Plan B, any kind of improvement... and was left wanting. Credit to the Revs, they neutralized Chris Rolfe and it seemed like they were always there for a challenge when the Fire began to move the ball into the final third \u2013 or should I say past the 35-yard line?</p> <p>Since there was virtually nothing positive about the game in Foxboro, turning attention to the regular season finale at TP is the only thing that Fire fans can do. DC is no doubt on a hot streak and hasn't lost in Chicago since 2006. I have little doubt that United will come out and play a similar game to the midfield-stifling tactics employed by the Revs. Better play will be required of the Fire's creative players, especially DP Alvaro Fernandez. The possible return of Pavel Pardo is on the table but really, the Fire won at New York without him and they should be able to take care of business at home. Even without Pardo, Arne Friedrich's return will definitely help fill a discernable leadership gap that existed last weekend. My hope is that the Fire come out swinging and wrest control from the get-go, but if they can't I'll settle for seeing some kind of backup plan to take this crucial three points at home and avoid the dreaded wildcard play-in games to kick off the postseason.</p> <p><strong>Martin Shatzer</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.blackandredunited.com/\">Black and Red United</a>, DC:</p> <p>DC United clinched their first playoff berth in five years on Saturday night, in a 3-2 win over the Columbus Crew. United showed true resilience, coming from behind twice and then scoring the game-winner in stoppage time, as Branko Boskovic sent a beautiful no-look over-the-shoulder pass to Lewis Neal, who beat the charging Columbus goalkeeper with a one-touch shot. RFK Stadium erupted as United was finally able to exorcise its demons and get over the hump. United is back in the playoffs where it belongs.</p> <p>The upcoming match this weekend has United paying a visit to the Chicago Fire \u2013 a team that is actually the likeliest first-round matchup for United in the playoffs. DC might struggle a bit to maintain the emotional high that was exhausted in the win over Columbus, but they certainly have a chance against the Fire, who have been inconsistent of late. Look for Ben Olsen to try to continue to develop the striking partnership of Lionard Pajoy and Maicon Santos up top, and for the United back line to continue its recent success, having allowed only four goals in its last six matches.</p> <p></p> <h2>4. Portland Timbers vs San Jose Earthquakes, Sat 6.30pm (NBCSN, TSN 2)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398431098\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/9/22/1348342890931/Chris-Wondolowski-of-the--010.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Wondolowski of the San Jose Earthquakes in action against Real Salt Lake\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Wondolowski of the San Jose Earthquakes in action. Photograph: Ezra Shaw/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ezra Shaw/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br><strong>Michael Orr</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.maofootball.wordpress.com\">Mao Football</a>, host of <a href=\"http://nasn.tv/category/soccer-made-in-portland/\">Soccer made in PDX</a> podcast:</p> <p>The Portland Timbers finally had something to celebrate in capturing the Cascadia Cup last weekend in Vancouver, with a 1-0 win over the Whitecaps. Not only did the victory secure the Timbers' first Cup in a three-way competition (they won it in 2009 and 2010 when competing only against Vancouver) but it also kept Portland off of the ignominious list of clubs to go an entire season without an away win. Jack Jewsbury was the hero with a terrific 39th-minute goal while Donovan Ricketts provided the Timbers' first clean sheet since 31 August \u2013 which was also the last time Portland won a game.</p> <p>In this final round of the season, there is very little left for the Timbers to evaluate as Caleb Porter's arrival draws nearer. Center-backs Futty Danso and Eric Brunner each had surgery this week, while Hanyer Mosquera is a serious question due to IT band tightness, leaving rookie Andrew Jean Baptiste as the only fully healthy option opposite David Horst. Gavin Wilkinson has suggested he will give several players a chance to play, so predicting the starting XI will be near impossible. Apart from possibly viewing a few rarely used players, the only other real drama in Saturday's game will be seeing if Portland can prevent Chris Wondolowski from breaking the MLS single-season scoring record. Given that he scored twice in 20 minutes in their last meeting, all eyes will be on the Quakes player.</p> <p><strong>Lisa Erickson</strong>, <a href=\"\" http: www.centerlinesoccer.com \"\">Center Line Soccer</a>, San Jose:</p> <p>The final edition California Clasico took place Sunday and it wasn't a San Jose sweep. The San Jose Earthquakes won the Supporters' Shield the night before, had a historic morning with the Guinness Book Record set for the most people participating in a groundbreaking (6,256) for their new stadium, and then met up with the LA Galaxy at Buck Shaw. LA was without Landon Donovan (injury) and David Beckham (small stadium syndrome) while San Jose was missing Alan Gordon (injury) and Jason Hernandez (suspension). The first half was Omar Gonzalez shutting down all aerial crosses that were looking for Steven Lenhart's head, which led to the Quakes having only two attempts on goal in the period. The second half was another story, with LA going up twice and San Jose finding the equalizer only minutes later. The last goal of the night was from Chris Wondolowski, his 26th of the season, which is one shy of Roy Lassiter's record. Lassiter happened to be in the stadium to meet the MLS MVP frontrunner.</p> <p>Now it's off to Portland to face the Timbers in a game that doesn't have any true bearing on the season for either team, except for that Wondolowski record chance. The Quakes will do everything in their power to see if Wondo can score one or more goals in order to share or take the record. However, it might not be that easy. The Quakes have never beaten Portland since they have come into MLS (they are 0-1-3) and Wondo has never scored a goal at Jeld-Wen field. Portland is a bit beaten up though, with three of their central defenders out with injury, so perhaps this Saturday we will see history made.</p> <p></p> <h2>5. Real Salt Lake vs Vancouver Whitecaps, Sat 9pm</h2> <p><strong>Denzel Eslinger</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.rslsoapbox.com/\">RSL Soapbox</a>:</p> <p>For Real there is little drama left to the season, after Tuesday's 0-0 draw with CS Herediano ended their Champions League campaign. RSL know they will face the Seattle Sounders in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs and the result of the match with Vancouver on Saturday can only impact which leg of the series will be played at home. There is no time to mourn the lost opportunity \u2013 there is time to prepare for the playoffs by regaining momentum in league play and to try to get healthy. Both Will Johnson and Chris Schuler left the midweek match with injuries but RSL are hopeful of getting Jamison Olave back for Saturday.</p> <p>I have a feeling it is likely that Vancouver will be using this as a light practice for their \"wildcard\" match against the LA Galaxy, while RSL actually have that last bit of potential drama to play for. RSL is currently fifth overall in MLS, so a win could see them move as high as third and a loss could put them as low as eighth, positioning that could have an impact upon potential Champions League slots for next summer. That is something worth playing for, so I expect RSL to pick up a 2-0 win over the Whitecaps, who have struggled recently and are clearly focused on their first MLS playoff match.</p> <p><strong>Benjamin Massey</strong>, Editor, <a href=\"http://www.eightysixforever.com\">Eighty Six Forever</a>, Vancouver:</p> <p>Caps are in the playoffs! The Whitecaps are in the playoffs! All else is irrelevant. Vancouver's playing Salt Lake this weekend? What's a \"Salt Lake\"? Is this a friendly prior to the Los Angeles Galaxy game, because have I mentioned the Whitecaps are in the playoffs?</p> <p>Now, if anything else were relevant, I might point out that the Whitecaps stank out the joint in one of the most desultory soccer games in BC Place history, losing 1-0 to last-placed Portland Timbers in what ought to have been a certain win and, worse than that, being comprehensively outplayed. The Whitecaps only secured a playoff spot thanks to Brad Evans and the Sounders thrashing FC Dallas. In their previous game, Vancouver absolutely demolished Chivas USA in an equally-important game against an equally-crap adversary, proving that if there's one thing you can count on from the Whitecaps, it's not being able to count on anything.</p> <p>Normally, you might expect Vancouver to rest veterans in the tough conditions of Rio Tinto, bearing in mind that, as has been established, the Whitecaps are in the playoffs. But having stumbled into the post-season like Saturday night drunks on Granville, the Whitecaps have a greater-than-usual motivation to play a good game against a Salt Lake side trying to find some form. And RSL has as little as it's mathematically possible to play for while still having something, so does this mean the Whitecaps will reverse their Portland garbage game and snatch a surprise result at the Riot? Probably not.</p> <p></p> <h2>6. Colorado Rapids vs Houston Dynamo, Sat 4pm</h2> <p><strong>Richard Bamber</strong>, COO, <a href=\"http://www.bulldogsupporters.com\">Bulldog Supporters Group</a>, Colorado Rapids:</p> <p>The Rapids finally got an away win, the first since FC Dallas way back on 6 May. OK, so it was against Chivas, a team who must be thoroughly sick of the sight of us as you have to go back to 2009 for the last time they got three points of us. But it was pleasing to see a goal each from Martin Rivero and Kamani Hill, both no doubt assisted by the Goats' total inability to man mark attacking players. A win is a win \u2013 and Portland's victory on Sunday ensured that Chivas will get the Western Conference wooden spoon.</p> <p>So with nothing at stake except vying with Portland for seventh in the West, we welcome a Houston team who really have everything to play for. The Dynamo are in fifth, although they could find themselves playing for third and thus avoiding the play-in game if results from earlier games go their way. So they'll be up for it, then...</p> <p>As for the Burgundy boys, expect a mix of fringe players and those first-teamers we still have fit to turn out on Saturday. Known absentees so far will be Matt Pickens, Brian Mullan and Conor Casey, in addition to our long-term injured players. While it's always nice to see the Rapids win, I doubt our fans will really care. Most will be relieved when the final whistle goes as it will mean this trainwreck of a season will be over at last.</p> <p><strong>Zach Woosley</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.dynamotheory.com/\">Dynamo Theory</a>, Houston:</p> <p>For a while last weekend, Dynamo fans were getting worried. The Crew were winning, the Dynamo were tied, the playoffs were slipping away. Then DC turned things around and the Dynamo offense finally awoke and a playoff spot was clinched. For me, the feeling was more about relief than excitement \u2013 after all, nobody wanted to join the list of MLS teams that had made the cup final and missed the playoffs the following season.</p> <p>As for the final game of the regular season, against the Rapids, it's hard to say how important it will be just yet. The Dynamo will know if they have a chance to move up to third or fourth place since the games that affect those chances will play earlier in the day before them. If things break right a win over Colorado could get the Dynamo out of the wild-card game\u2026 or they could move to host it\u2026 or they could stay in fifth. Nothing like possibilities!</p> <p></p> <h2>7. Columbus Crew vs Toronto FC, Sun 4pm (TSN, RDS2)</h2> <p><strong>Ben Hoelzel</strong>, <a href=\"http://crewunion.com\">Crew Union</a>, Columbus Crew:</p> <p>Last week's loss at DC ended the Crew's dramatic playoff push. For the first time since 2008, the MLS playoffs will be played without the Black and Gold. The Crew took an early lead and were up 2-1 at halftime. To be honest, DC does not look like that great of a team, but the Crew players came out of halftime and looked like they simply didn't care. Poor defending, lackadaisical play and lazy passing doomed the Crew. With the exception of the tireless work rate of Eddie Gaven and a few flashes from some other players, the Crew looked like they just didn't care anymore, and the result reflected their effort.</p> <p>The last game of the season sees old foe Toronto come to town. Toronto has not had much to play for in quite some time and has not won a game in about a month. The Crew have nothing to play for either and already looked like they didn't care about playing last week. I wouldn't expect an exciting game. However, the Crew are slightly better and slightly less uninterested than Toronto and will take the game 3-1 for a useless three points.</p> <p><strong>Boris Aguilar</strong>, Executive, <a href=\"http://www.redpatchboys.ca/\">Red Patch Boys</a>:</p> <p>The year that all TFC fans and supporters just want to end keeps bringing extreme disappointment. There's no other word that comes to mind that describes this season. Disappointment. From our on-field performance to a lack of support, it's all been a disappointment. TFC has extended its winless streak to 13 matches. The team has not won since the dog days of summer and we are entering the middle of fall. The weather is as cold as the luck we have gotten this season. </p> <p>Last weekend's game was no different. TFC was lucky to even come out with a point in the Canadian derby (sorry, Vancouver). Toronto just could not remember how to handle a ball in the last third of the field. Our defense, which has never been great, continued to let the opposition just walk right in and take kicking practice against the keeper. The only positive is that in our three matches against Montreal we were 1-1-1. </p> <p>Having said that, this week we face our closest (by distance) American \"rival\", Columbus. I expect TFC to play with heart. I expect TFC to remind fans and supporters alike why we fell in love with them in the first place. I firmly believe we can win this game 2-1. </p> <p></p> <h2>8. FC Dallas vs Chivas USA, Sun 7pm (Galavision)</h2> <p><strong>Gina Zippilli</strong>, <a href=\"http://the-inferno.net\">The Inferno</a>, Dallas:</p> <p>Last week was incredibly disappointing. The team came out totally flat against Seattle. Portland did us a huge favor earlier in the day by winning at Vancouver, but with a playoff spot still possible, the team totally lacked energy and focus. They've made such progress in the second half of the season that to just fall short at the last minute is so frustrating, and it was an old pattern \u2013 the team go a goal down, then get hauled back into it on Blas Perez's back, then let the game slip again. There's been no injury rash or wave of call-ups to explain it, it's just very frustrating to be handed a lifeline by Portland and then play like you didn't know it was there.</p> <p>Last game of the season against Chivas, then. Basically, whatever. The fans are looking at this game as one big party, regardless of what happens on the field. The players were tweeting their disappointment after the game last week, but they didn't do anything on the day to show they cared and would do anything to win. </p> <p><strong>Alicia Ratterree</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.thegoatparade.com/\">The Goat Parade</a>, Chivas USA:</p> <p>In their last match, Chivas lost 2-0 to the Colorado Rapids. Although there was hope that they would revive their form after the previous performance, they came out flat and could not keep up with a rather pedestrian effort from Colorado. It was a disappointing end to the home campaign, but given the turmoil Chivas have gone through in the past few months the result was not unexpected.</p> <p>The season will conclude with the Dallas match. Working in Chivas' favor is that they played well against Dallas last time out. Working against Chivas is the report that they are set to fire Robin Fraser after the season ends, so what will that mean for this game? Certainly the team could seek to end Fraser's tenure on a high note with a win, but the timing of the report will likely further demoralize the Goats. Regardless of the outcome, it is probably for the best that an ultimately poor season is coming to an end.</p> <p></p> <h2>9. LA Galaxy vs Seattle Sounders, Sun 9pm (ESPN, ESPND, TSN 2)</h2> <p><strong>GUARDIAN LIVE GAME</strong></p> <p><strong>Josie Becker</strong>, Editor, <a href=\"http://www.lagconfidential.com\">LAG Confidential</a>, Los Angeles:</p> <p>The LA Galaxy managed their best result of the season against San Jose. Once again they were the pacesetters in goal scoring, but for once Alan Gordon was unavailable to come off the bench and Berzerker his way to a goal. The draw for the Galaxy was a confidence-builder going into a likely playoff showdown. LA managed the draw without Landon Donovan and David Beckham as Bruce Arena once against pulled a reverse Don Revie (instead of a player saying he's hurt and then showing up, players give no indication they're hurt and then don't show up). Getting a goal from Robbie Keane is nothing new for LA, as he's started to blossom in MLS, but getting a goal from Edson Buddle showed that the maligned striker still has a purpose going forward. </p> <p>This week against Seattle will be a bit of a training test as Donovan and Beckham try to get their fitness back before the play-in match against Vancouver. AJ DeLaGarza is also supposed to be back for the playoffs, so the Galaxy will be back at full strength once the postseason begins. What they won't be is hot. The fortunate bit for the Galaxy is no team in the West is hot. In playing each other this past week, the top four in the West all shared a point. Still, San Jose's style of play \u2013 thank goodness they didn't play in Champions League, or their wheels would have fallen off ages ago \u2013 could be enough to carry them through. No lead in an aggregate series will be safe. </p> <p><strong>Sam Chesneau</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.gorillafc.com/\">Gorilla FC</a>, Seattle:</p> <p>The Sounders wrapped up a great week of results with 3-1 victories at home against FC Dallas and Marathon of Honduras. The former match saw a great performance and a brace from MLS player of the week Brad Evans, and the latter saw the return of Marcus Hahnemann between the sticks and a well balanced effort by a crop of players fighting for their place in the rotation leading up to the playoffs. Mario Martinez made some news after tweeting his frustration at not getting playing time, and while it might have lacked judgement to make his feelings viewable to the world wide web, his performance against Marathon with two assists certainly supported his case, putting the pressure on Sigi Schmid to decide who starts and who comes in to our crowded midfield with all that talent. A good problem to have, but one well above my pay grade.</p> <p>This week marks the closing of a season that was much of the same the past four years for the Sounders. I think, like in any relationship, you have to introduce new ways to make it exciting \u2013 having a good regular season just isn't enough to keep the fans happy. I have no doubts that the votes will come in favor of retaining Adrian Hanauer, for the wonderful work he and his front office have done constructing a winner on day one. </p> <p>However, not having a US Open Cup, a Cascadia Cup or a Supporters' Shield, and having to wait for Champions League quarterfinals next season, means there is only one thing left to do: as the fictional character Jake Taylor of the Cleveland Indians from Major League said: \"Win the whole ******** thing.\" </p> <p>In order for this season to not be a bust, making it out of the Western Conference into the MLS Cup and securing a Champions League spot for 2013-2014 is the only option at this point. So as for this match against the Galaxy, a win is necessary to secure that No2 seeding, in the hopes of potentially having 67,000 watch the Sounders hoist the silverware for the fans. I'm predicting a 1-0 win over an uninspired Galaxy at Home Depot.</p>",
  "<p>Poor Andy Smith. As a digital security adviser at the Cabinet Office, you'd think he'd be safe <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20082493\" title=\"\">offering up a bit of digital security advice</a> at a digital security conference.</p> <p>But instead, the luckless fellow now stands accused of advocating a practice that enables the abuse of children. Helen Goodman, shadow culture minister, said it was \"totally outrageous\" that Smith had the gall to advise attendees of the <a href=\"http://www.parliamentandinternet.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Parliament and the Internet Conference</a> to be wary of the personal details they give out online. If a social networking site forces you to provide information you're uncomfortable about offering up \u2013 including your name and date of birth \u2013 give false information, he suggested.</p> <p>I'm not sure making up data is necessarily the best advice Smith could have given, but you can see where he was coming from: if you are suspicious about why a site is asking for your details, don't give them. That's not how Goodman saw it: \"It is exactly what we don't want,\" she told the BBC. \"We want more security online. It's anonymity which facilitates cyberbullying, the abuse of children. I was genuinely shocked that a public official could say such a thing\".</p> <p>Of course, we all want to feel secure online, and I hope even the hardest hearts would want to end online bullying. But placing our sensitive personal details into the hands of online companies isn't going to make either of these come true. I'm not sure where her shock comes from, but her argument is misplaced.</p> <p>Increased online security requires less identifying information out there, not more. While systems trying to keep data secure online have rapidly developed, it is worth remembering the history of data protection is still littered with mistakes. Even recently big, well-known companies such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/apr/26/playstation-network-hackers-data?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Sony</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jun/06/linkedin-hacking\" title=\"\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/dec/13/gawker-hacked-password-change\" title=\"\">eHarmony</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/aug/02/sun-website-users-personal-details-hacked\" title=\"\">the Sun</a> have had customer data stolen by hackers. This does suggest you should be a bit discerning about who you share your details with and how much you give out.</p> <p>Worse is when you do all the hard work for the thieves. Earlier this year, a report into US identity fraud found it was on the rise, in part because of the incredible amount of personal information being shared on public social media profiles. Internet users forget we can leave a trail of information around the web that, with just a few Google searches, can build a detailed picture of us. This was brought home for me when \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.joannageary.com/2011/08/02/privacy-and-social-media-investigation-how-i-tracked-down-an-entire-family-from-one-tweet/\" title=\"\">from just one tweet</a> \u2013 I was able to track down the name, address, location, family members and military status of a person in nine steps. Making lots of data publicly available online will put you at a greater risk. Therefore, don't put up so much. You are under no obligation to give over your real details on signing up to a site.</p> <p>While I sympathise with the concern that bullies can hide behind a pseudonym; there is a body of evidence that suggests forcing people to give over real details won't necessarily stop nasty behaviour. South Korea demonstrates that very well. In 2007, in an attempt to crack down on cyberbullying, the country required any website with over 100,000 visitors a day to ask for a real name and national ID before a user could post or upload content. This summer, the <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444082904577606794167615620.html\" title=\"\">law was repealed</a> after it was deemed unconstitutional and ineffective. Another nail in its coffin was that hackers managed to access the verification system and <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/tech-news/personal-data-of-35-million-hacked-in-attack-on-south-korean-social-media-sites/article588550/\" title=\"\">stole the IDs of 35 million people</a>.</p> <p>Less anonymity did not equal more security or less bullying. Rather than requiring more personal information, perhaps the answer lies in sites having a duty of care to those who experience bullying and developing systems to take action. Parents and schools also need to educate children to both the possibilities and dangers of the web \u2013 teach them how to be suspicious of anonymous accounts and how to take action against those that bully. But to conclude privacy causes bullying, as Goodman does, is to tread a dangerous path. We all have the right to privacy and there is absolutely no reason why attempts to curb cyberbullying should prevent us from maintaining that.</p> <p>That's not shocking, that's just common sense.</p>",
  "<p>This month, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/a-room-for-london\" title=\"\">A Room for London</a> plays host to novelist Kamila Shamsie. For four days each month, a different artist is spending time in the houseboat currently perched on the top of the South Bank Centre in London <a href=\"http://www.aroomforlondon.co.uk/hearts-of-darkness\" title=\"\">as part of Artangel's year-long project, A London Address</a>. Earlier in the year we welcomed<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2012/jan/24/live-webchat-juan-gabriel-vasquez\"> Juan Gabriel V\u00e1squez</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2012/feb/22/jeanette-winterson-live-webchat\">Jeanette Winterson</a> for live webchats from the boat.</p> <p>The writer currently undertaking this challenge is <a href=\"http://literature.britishcouncil.org/kamila-shamsie\" title=\"\">Kamila Shamsie</a>, author of the novels <a href=\"http://bookdragon.si.edu/2009/11/01/in-the-city-by-the-sea-by-kamila-shamsie/\" title=\"\">In the City by the Sea</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2003/jun/07/featuresreviews.guardianreview2\" title=\"\">Kartography</a> (both shortlisted for the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize), <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Salt and Saffron</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2005/apr/16/featuresreviews.guardianreview8\" title=\"\">Broken Verses</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/mar/07/burnt-shadows-kamila-shamsie-review\" title=\"\">Burnt Shadows</a> which was shortlisted for the Orange Prize.</p> <p>Kamila will be holding a webchat live from the boat on <strong>Monday 29 October, taking place here between 1-2pm (BST)</strong>. She will be talking about the time she has spent on the boat and whether it has aided her creativity and productivity, as well as discussing her work and writing.</p> <p>Post your questions below now and come back on Monday at 1pm to chat live to Kamila.</p> <p>We've posted the conversation here to make it easier to follow:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19106772\">epigrapheuse asks</a>:</h2> <p>Hi Kamila, I'm really excited that you're on A Room for London! I'm intrigued by your experience of living atop -- or beside, rather -- the Thames; do you find that living in a boat, as such, as opposed to any regular room with a view of the Thames, makes a particular difference to your process? The word that comes to mind is \"unsettling\", for we tend to think of boats as creatures inseparable from water. How has that affected you?</p> <p>This would lead into a larger question about your relationship with water bodies generally: you are from Karachi, which is, as you say, the city by the sea. The sea also features as a rather prominent figure in novels like Kartography. Is water a powerful influence on your writing, in terms of poiesis?</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19142099\">kamilashamsie replies</a>:</h2> <p>I think the primary difference living up here makes to process has to do with time. When I sit down at a desk it can take me a while to sink into a frame of mind where nothing distracts me from the sentences, the thoughts I'm attempting to string together. Up here, I seem to be living in a concrete (or wooden) version of that frame of mind \u2013 slightly separate from the world but with a view on it, nothing pressing down on me, a sense of unexpectedness all around. So I don't need to struggle to find my way into a writing frame of mind \u2013 I am in in automatically. Fancy way of saying I've been writing very productively here.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19141854\">Gravesend123 asks</a>:</h2> <p>Oh and a second question. According to A Room for London's website, there's a library of books aboard the boat. Have you read or looked at any? Do you have a favourite book about London?</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19142154\">kamilashamsie replies</a>:</h2> <p>Yes, I'm surrounded by wonderful books. Including three copies of 'Heart of Darkness', many books about London and rivers and ships. There are so many books here I haven't read and yet - because this is Conrad's boat - I find I'm unable to move away from 'Heart of Darkness' which I've read and re-read before.</p> <p>Favourite book about London: well, as I'm up in this aerial ship, the first thing that comes to mind is Peter Pen.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19141866\">CinziaSy asks</a>:</h2> <p>As a post colonialist writer, how relevant do you feel novels such as Joseph Conrad's 'The Heart of Darkness' are to members of twenty-first century society?</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19142238\">kamilashamsie replies</a>:</h2> <p>I'm always a little wary around the post-colonialist tag - so let's just say that as someone living in the 21st century I'm struck by how Heart of Darkness seems to speak even more to me now than it did when I first read it 20 years ago. That could be because I'm older; but more likely, I think, that we're still surrounded by Kurtz-like figures and Imperial Vanities.<br>But this time around - and I've written about this for my podcast - I'm also struck by the overwhelming maleness of Conrad's world. And i wish that felt more outdated than it does!</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19101307\">everbleed asks</a>:</h2> <p>Over time, great literature is subsumed into the consciousness of a nation. Even though your novels are mostly set in Pakistan, they remain inaccessible to the majority of the people therein.</p> <p>Your stories, no matter how well told, will never truly be part of the zeitgeist for a people. Although it is supremely arrogant for any writer to set out with that goal primarily in mind, it is surely something that many must at least secretly aspire to.</p> <p>Does it bother you that your work will, in all probability, never achieve that status?</p> <p>Why do you think it is that many of the brightest literary minds in the subcontinent are writing in a foreign language?</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19142378\">kamilashamsie replies</a>:</h2> <p>I don't know that all writers secretly aspire to being part of the zeitgeist of a particular nation. I'm not bothered by being un-zeitgeisty, but of course I wish more people in Pakistan could read my books. This has nothing to do with a 'foreign' language - isn't it odd that both Pakistan's official language (English) and its national language (Urdu) get referred to as foreign languages because they originated outside the geographical boundaries of the nation-state? But yes, English is a language that only a small minority know well enough to read novels in it. The same is true of many other languages of Pakistan - Balochi, Siraiki etc. Though in the case of English it isn't ethnic background that divides the readers. The real answer, of course, for writers in all Pakistan's languages lies in translation - but sadly, the publishing infrastructure in the country doesn't support a healthy translation industry.<br>Given how low the literacy rates are in the country, in any language, it's really poets who are part of the zeitgeist, much more than novelists.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19105392\">SKMGweme asks</a>:</h2> <p>Hi Kamila. Great to see you here. Can you tell us about the education project that you took part in that was funded by the Open Society? I also understand that you have worked with Amnesty International. Do you see yourself as a a writer and activist?</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19142607\">kamilashamsie replies</a>:</h2> <p>Hi, and thanks. The education project is called Writers Bloc. It was started by 5 writers - Zadie Smith, Nick Laird, Hari Kunzru, Rachel Holmes and myself - with funding from OSF. The brief is simple: send writers to different countries to write about education there. Leave it to the writers' curiosity and imagination to decide what they want to write about. The intention was to end up with a series of essays on education that did something which policy papers - irreplaceable as they are - can't do, which is to talk about some of the challenges around education in very human terms. The essays were published in Guernica - here's the introduction by Zadie Smith, with links to the other pieces: http://www.guernicamag.com/features/smith_01_15_12/</p> <p>As for how I see myself - I wouldn't say writer/activist. That would be an insult to people who really are activists. But every so often there are opportunities for my writing life to overlap with campaigns, ideas that activists are working on.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19142562\">CinziaSy asks</a>:</h2> <p>Thank you Kamila for your response, and I certainly take your point about the maleness of Conrad's novel not being as outdated as one would wish it was! However, which is more important to you today: your gender or your nationality, and which do you think is more significant in society today?</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19142774\">kamilashamsie replies</a>:</h2> <p>Depends entirely on the context. both to me and to society. But the significant difference is I can walk through various parts of the world and not be immediately recognised as a Pakistani (or I can be in a place where everyone is Pakistani so it's not a way of separating me from the others around me). But I'm always recognised as female. So I suppose I encounter and am aware of responses to my femaleness more of the time.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19102357\">atavisticendeavor asks</a>:</h2> <p>Hi Kamila. In Burnt Shadows it seems one of your intentions was to transcend the nation, as the novel's traditional frame, and point individual awareness in a different direction.</p> <p>Can I ask what your reasons were for this and whether you would describe Burnt Shadows as a novel of globalisation, internationalism or cosmopolitanism?</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19142920\">kamilashamsie replies</a>:</h2> <p>Hi - the question of intention assumes, well, intention. I do start off my novels with some kind of intentions but they generally get thrown overboard very quickly. 'Burnt Shadows' was supposed to be a novel about the Indo-Pak nuclear stand-off. Go figure, as they say. I like Michael Ondaatje's phrase 'following the brush' to describe writers whose process involve working out what you're doing only as you're doing it.<br>Certainly my own deep misgivings about the nation-state make its way through the novel, but I didn't at any point think that I was transcending the novel's traditional frame. And I suppose this is because some of the novels I love the most - Ondaatje's 'the English Patient' and 'In the Skin of a Lion' particularly come to mind - have already achieved this far better than I could.<br>How would I describe 'Burnt Shadows'? The book wot I wrote. Beyond that, I leave it to the critics.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19140355\">Skasster asks</a>:</h2> <p>What project are you working on right now? Novel/ short stories? Will you be writing a non-fiction book in the near future?</p> <p>Also - if you were to appear on Come Dine with Me, what would you make for your guests? (No, I really want to know!)</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19143182\">kamilashamsie replies</a>:</h2> <p>This morning I was working up finishing up the 'London address' which will be podcast at the end of my stay up here on this amazing boat. But mostly these days I'm working on a new novel set mainly in Peshwar in 1915 and 1930.<br>Come Dine With Me: now this a question that requires deep thought. And an Urdu-English dictionary (in culinary terms, my English falters). Probably something like this: baghary baingan, deep fried bhindi, garam masala aloo, murgh korma, timatur kut.<br>Now I'm hungry.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19142991\">@simon_r_katz on twitter asks</a>:</h2> <p>Kamila, have you been cooking and if so what have you cooked?</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19143230\">kamilashamsie replies</a>:</h2> <p>I have not! Only a microwave here, but let's be honest - I'm so near Borough Market and the foodstalls behind the Royal Festival Hall that there's not much likelihood I'd be donning an apron even if the kitchen was fully equipped.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19142923\">Carolina via email</a>:</h2> <p>Kamila, was it daunting to take on Hiroshima when you wrote Burnt Shadows? Did you feel a responsibility to the people who'd died, and did that change the way you wrote the book? thanks!</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19143357\">kamilashamsie replies</a>:</h2> <p>Nagasaki, not Hiroshima. And yes, it was tremendously daunting. If I could have thought of a way to write about the bombing of Nagasaki without writing about the bombing of Nagsaki i expect I'd have done that - I was only really able to do it because I started off thinking, well, this will never work and I'll have to give up at some point but let's see what I can manage.<br>And yes, there is of course some sense of responsibility - but if I'd ever framed it to myself in terms of being responsible to hundreds of thousands of people who'd died or suffered the effects of radiation I'd probably have crawled into a dark corner somewhere. In the end, what I kept in mind was my responsibility as a novelist to create this world to the best of my abilities, without shortcuts or compromises.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19143198\">littlewhite asks</a>:</h2> <p>Hi Kamila</p> <p>I am interested to know whether anything has particularly surprised you about spending four days alone in the Room For London? Or is it pretty much as you expected? Have you seen anything out of the ordinary/ unexpected which you would like to share with us?</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19143474\">kamilashamsie replies</a>:</h2> <p>I'd be surprised if even the most imaginative novelists could find their expectations of this place matching up to actually being here. Surprises: how much more breath-taking the view is than I would have imagined; how time seems to slow down after sunset so that the night seems a vast and wonderful expanse in which to read and write and listen to Billie Holiday; the lift which takes you up and down is manufactured by a company called ALIMAK, which is my name backwards; the lights are turned off on Big Ben's clockface at midnight the night BST ends; the spaciousness of the boat, the excellent water pressure of the shower. etc etc etc</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19141760\">Gravesend123 asks</a>:</h2> <p>I hope you're enjoying your stay in the boat. As A London Address is a series of podcast recordings, I'm wondering if you've approached the writing of the piece any differently knowing that you have to read it aloud? Thank you.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19143568\">kamilashamsie replies</a>:</h2> <p>Yes - I've written for the radio before, and I always find that I'm writing in a slightly different rhythm if I know it's going to be recorded. A little more conversational - and I try to avoid complex sentence structures which the eye can follow but the ear might have more trouble with (particularly if the ear hears it being read by someone who isn't a trained actor able to articulate a semi-colon.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19103444\">Beeeee asks</a>:</h2> <p>Does it matter where you come from?</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19143636\">kamilashamsie replies</a>:</h2> <p>Well, context always matters \u2013 and where you're from is always part of your context (as is where you've been, and where you are.) In terms of my novels they seem increasingly to circle back in one way or another to Pakistan's history \u2013 which is both very short and also filled with gaps (in terms of my own understanding of it). Though having said that, I don't mean I feel limited by the nation-as-subject, or bound exclusively to it.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19143234\">CinziaSy asks</a>:</h2> <p>Do you ever feel conscious that many readers will approach your literature with more defined preconceptions about Pakistan than they would about any other culture due to media coverage of the troubles in the region? If so, do you feel works in your favor or not?</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19143696\">kamilashamsie replies</a>:</h2> <p>When I'm writing, no. When the books are published, it's hard to get away from questions about Pakistan. But all novelists create the world of their novels on the page - so like any other novelist I concentrate on creating that world of the novel, and trust my readers to enter into it on the terms in which it's presented.

  "<p>Last month, Vanity Fair featured <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/10/michael-lewis-profile-barack-obama\">a major profile of President Obama</a> by Michael Lewis, who was given what <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/a-journalist-with-rare-access-to-obama-had-to-play-by-quote-rule/\">the New York Times called</a> \"rare\" and \"extraordinary access\". Lewis \"conducted multiple interviews with the president\"; \"rode in the official presidential limousine\"; \"was given a special lapel pin that identified him to the Secret Service as someone who was allowed to be in close proximity to the president\"; and \"flew with the president on several foreign and domestic trips\" -- \"not with the rest of the press corps in the back of Air Force One, but near the front.\" And, noted the Times, \"the president even allowed Mr. Lewis to play on his basketball team.\"</p> <p>But in exchange for such access, Lewis, unbeknownst to readers of his profile, had agreed to a journalistically corrupt practice - now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/us-news-blog/2012/sep/20/new-york-times-bans-quote-approval\">banned by many large media outlets</a> - whereby the only quotes he was permitted to use were ones the White House approved in advance. Unsurprisingly, the profile was pure hagiography that left Obama's most devoted media fans <a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2012/09/how-to-be-president.html\">gushing with ecstacy</a>.</p> <p>Though I would have thought it impossible, Rolling Stone somehow just managed to top that profile when it comes to sycophantic, power-worshiping \"journalism\". This week, it features <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/obama-and-the-road-ahead-the-rolling-stone-interview-20121025\">a cover story on Obama</a> by its contributing editor, the historian Douglas Brinkley, largely based on a 45-minute interview in the Oval Office. The questions Brinkley posed are so vapid and reverent that it is hard to believe it's not satire.</p> <p>Most of his questions are some iteration of asking Obama: <em>Seriously, how heinous is Mitt Romney? How gross is he? And really, how great are you?</em> Just behold some of the questions which this historian and journalist - given the opportunity for a one-on-one interview with the president of the United States - chose to ask, beginning with the first four of the interview:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Let's start with how the campaign has been going. Ever since the first debate, Romney has abruptly shifted his position on a whole host of issues, from his tax plan to financial regulation [that's the entirety of his first \"question\"]. </p> <p>\"Many observers have commented on how Romney has misrepresented or even changed his positions in this last leg of the campaign \u2013 that he's been like a chameleon on plaid. Do you feel that he has lied to the American people? </p> <p>\"Where were you when you first saw Romney's speech in Boca Raton about the 47 percent? What was your first reaction? </p> <p>\"What has surprised you the most about the Republican campaign this year? </p> <p>\"You said, 'a.k.a. Obamacare.' Do you mind if historians call the achievement Obamacare?</p> <p>\"You sometimes use the term 'fair shake'. FDR had the New Deal, Lyndon Johnson had the Great Society. Is the Fair Shake something you'd be comfortable with to describe your legacy? </p> <p>\"The auto bailout helped rescue states like Ohio from economic disaster. What, in turn, have you learned from the people of Ohio during your many visits to the state? </p> <p>\"Bill Clinton \u2013 how important is he as a surrogate for you? What's your friendship with him like these days? </p> <p>\"Halloween's coming up. If you could have Mitt Romney dress in a costume, what should he be for Halloween?\" </p> </blockquote> <p>If nothing else, shouldn't a concern for his own dignity lead Brinkley to have at least a pretense of adversarial substance? An interview of Obama by White House Press Secretary Jay Carney would have been more challenging. Had Brinkley had more time, next on his list of questions undoubtedly included: \"Do you believe Romney is more like Hitler or Satan?\", and \"Sir, do you mind that historians will likely see you as a mix of Gandhi and Jesus?\"</p> <p>Ample ink is spilled over debating whether the US media is biased in favor of Republicans or Democrats. It is neither. The overwhelming, driving bias of the US media is subservience to power, whoever happens to be wielding it.</p> <p>That is what explains why the US media has been so obsequious first with George Bush and now with his Democratic successor (for those who doubt that \"the liberal media\" venerated Bush as much as Lewis and Brinkely do Obama, I'll remind you of <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/research/2006/04/27/mission-accomplished-a-look-back-at-the-medias/135513\">this still-remarkable, borderline pornographic display of giddy fawning</a> on Mission Accomplished Day, or the fact that Bush's own Press Secretary <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2008/05/28/mcclellan_6/\">wrote a book</a> mocking the US media for how \"deferential\" it was to the Bush White House). It's why journalists <a href=\"http://wonkette.com/402599/david-gregory-famous-for-one-thing-dancing\">joyously dance with top officials</a>, <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/2008/10/tire_swinging_the_alternative.php\">swing on their tires</a>, are <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/06/07/washington_3/\">creepily grateful when they're sprayed in the face by their squirt guns</a>, and <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/a-football-draw-for-romneys-staff-and-the-press/\">play fun beach games with the very campaign officials they're ostensibly covering</a>.</p> <p>The central function, the religion, of the US establishment media is adulation of those who wield power, <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/05/03/nbc_news_top_hagiographer/\">especially military power</a> as personified by the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2008/11/02/biden_12/\">inaptly referred to</a> \"commander-in-chief\". Brinkley conducted the interview in the Oval Office from his knees because - with some significant exceptions - that's the posture which US media culture assumes in the presence of the royal court.</p> <p>What makes this most ironic, and most destructive, is that this function is the exact antithesis of what media figures claim they perform and what pioneers of press freedom protections envisioned. The political media is designed to be adversarial because it is supposed to serve as a scrutinizing check on the claims of those in power, not serve as worshipful, propagandistic amplifiers of those claims. </p> <p>If, as is obviously the case, Brinkley desperately craves Obama's re-election, that's fine. But as a journalist and historian, there are all sorts of dubious assertions and controversial actions on the part of the president that merit questioning and challenge. One would think that minimal intellectual curiosity, or at least base professional self-esteem, would prevent someone like Brinkley from completely squandering this opportunity by taking the time he was given to flatter and serve the president.</p> <p>But one would be wrong. He was given this time and access precisely because the White House knew how and toward what end he would use it. In other words, they knew he was a typical member of the US press corps and his behavior would therefore be reverent in the extreme. One cannot blame the White House for exploiting those eager to spit up hagiography masquerading as journalism. The fault lies with those who deceive the public by holding themselves out as journalists.</p>",
  "<p>Spain's Princess Cristina and her husband, I\u00f1aki Urdangar\u00edn, took a \u20ac5m mortgage on his declared monthly salary of \u20ac3,000, it has emerged, the latest embarrassing details about the financial dealings of the king's daughter and son-in-law.</p> <p>Leaked documents from a court investigation into alleged fraud by Urdangar\u00edn, the duke of Palma, revealed that the Caixa savings bank gave him the mortgage in 2004 to buy a \u20ac5.8m house in one of the most exclusive areas of Barcelona.</p> <p>The duke had presented the bank with a tax declaration that showed his work income was \u20ac36,000 a year. He declared another \u20ac76,000 in income from investments.</p> <p>It was not clear how much the princess declared. Court papers reportedly show that she earned about \u20ac90,000 that year working for the Caixa's charitable foundation, and received a further \u20ac72,000 from her father, King Juan Carlos.</p> <p>The duke, a former Olympic handball player turned self-employed businessman who was given his title after marrying Cristina, had \u20ac1.3m of savings in bank accounts. The tax declaration was published in El Pa\u00eds newspaper.</p> <p>The duke is being investigated for alleged fraud and tax evasion after using his position to win contracts to organise sports events and conferences for regional governments in Valencia and the Balearic islands. He and his partners allegedly channelled \u20ac6m from these contracts through not-for-profit organisations, and money was then sent on to tax havens.</p> <p>The king has since struck Cristina and her husband off the list of those who represent the crown at official occasions.</p> <p>News of the miraculous mortgage came as protesters gathered outside a branch of the nationalised bank Bankia in Madrid to demand it stop throwing indebted borrowers out of their homes. \"We don't negotiate with collectives, only with individual mortgage holders,\" a spokeswoman for the bank said.</p> <p>It has been a bad year for Juan Carlos, whose popularity suffered when he was found to have accepted an all-expenses-paid trip to hunt elephants in Africa in the middle of the worst economic crisis Spain has seen for decades. He injured himself during the trip, and was forced to offer a public apology.</p>",
  "<p>Burma has taken another step towards reintegration into the global economy with the announcement by the <a href=\"http://www.adb.org/countries/myanmar/main\" title=\"\">Asian Development Bank</a> (ADB) of a strategy that sets the stage for a resumption of full operations in a country cut off from western funds for decades.</p> <p>The bank has not provided direct assistance to Burma since 1988, but has maintained contact with the government through the country's participation in the Greater Mekong sub-region programme, a regional economic integration initiative. The ADB is the first multilateral development bank to approve an interim country partnership strategy for Burma.</p> <p>\"ADB will work with the government to create jobs and lay the foundation for long-term economic growth that benefits the country as a whole,\" said Stephen Groff, ADB's vice-president for east Asia, south-east Asia and the Pacific. \"This strategy will guide our re-engagement with Myanmar [Burma] to make sure the country is set on a path of sustainable and inclusive growth.\"</p> <p>Burma has undertaken democratic reforms under President Thein Sein, including byelections held this year for parliament, in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/aung-san-suu-kyi\" title=\"\">Aung San Suu Kyi</a>, the Nobel laureate and pro-democracy leader, won a seat. A second wave of reforms was announced in June.</p> <p>The democratic opening has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/27/us-eases-burma-sanctions-clinton-sein\" title=\"\">prompted the US and other countries to lift sanctions against Rangoon</a>. Last week, Thein Sein said Burma's foreign investment law could be ready soon. However, western companies are still wary because of legal uncertainty over foreign investment laws, which are governed by a decades-old code.</p> <p>Burma, the largest country in mainland south-east Asia, sits on considerable natural riches, including arable land, forests, minerals, natural gas, fresh water and marine resources. The economy is dominated by agriculture and farm-related activities, which account for 36% of GDP and 60-70% of employment.</p> <p>Despite some progress on poverty reduction, primary education and gender equality, Burma remains one of the world's poorest countries, with a per-capita GDP of $857 (\u00a3536). It is ranked 149 out of 187 countries in the UN human development index.</p> <p>Burma's economic outlook is positive, however. The ADB notes that the country has been bolstered by strong export earnings from commodities and increased foreign investment, and forecasts that Burma's GDP growth will accelerate from about 5.5% this year to 6.3% in 2013 and 6.5% in 2014. In the near term, the ADB will roll out grants aimed at helping government ministries to better plan and implement development projects, manage reforms and improve data gathering.</p> <p>A central aim of the ADB's strategy is to narrow the income gap between urban and rural areas, and to close the development gap with Burma's neighbours. To boost growth, the ADB will work with the government to identify key infrastructure investments, particularly in transport and energy. The bank will collaborate with communities on infrastructure and other projects to improve livelihoods in rural areas \u2013 including ethnic minority areas \u2013 where the majority of people live.</p> <p>However, full resumption of ADB operations is contingent on the full settlement of Burma's $520.5m arrears with the bank. Japan has agreed to provide bridge loans to Burma through its Bank of International Co-operation so that the country's arrears to both the ADB and the World Bank can be cleared. This is expected to be done by January, paving the way for multilateral lending for Rangoon. In August, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19077440\" title=\"\">the World Bank said it was considering restarting aid to Burma</a>, adding that it was preparing up to $85m in grants.</p> <p>The UN special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Burma, Tom\u00e1s Ojea Quintana, has emphasised that human rights should lie at the heart of the country's reform. <a href=\"http://undocs.org/A/67/333\" title=\"\">He acknowledged in a report the dramatic economic development Burma will experience over the coming years</a> (pdf), but highlighted concerns about land and housing rights, including \"land grabbing\". He also made recommendations on private companies and foreign investment to help ensure a sustainable form of development that is not exploitative.</p> <p>\"Human rights considerations need to shape the process of economic growth, legislative reform and institutional change, while also guiding responses to ongoing serious human rights situations, including in Rakhine and Kachin states,\" he said. Conflict between <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/video/2012/jun/22/rohingya-refugees-burma-bangladesh-video\" title=\"\">Buddhist and Muslim communities in Rakhine</a> (video) has left scores dead, more than 850 people detained and tens of thousands displaced.</p>",
  "<p>I have made some terrible TV shows in my life. I am honestly blushing just thinking about them. I've never actually intended to do this, but from time to time you lose control of the steering and can only watch as your project drives into a brick wall. We all make mistakes, right? But not all of our mistakes end up being presented by Nick Knowles on primetime TV.

What I actually did was marry the mind-numbing tedium of a second-rate reality show, with the plodding boredom of a sub-standard pub quiz. Presented by Barry from EastEnders. It really didn't work. I did actually figure out how to fix it towards the end of its short run but by then it had already been encased in lead and dumped into the North Sea by ITV executives. If you listen very carefully on the Harwich to Stavanger ferry you can still hear it screaming. The only good news is that I don't get too much stick for it. Firstly because everyone knows how easy it is to make a bad gameshow, and secondly because I sit opposite the guy who came up with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b010w1y2\" title=\"\">Don't Scare The Hare</a>, so I'm not even the biggest loser on my desk.</p> <h2>Red Or Black</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398397045\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/26/1351247599131/Red-or-Black-008.jpg\" alt=\"Red or Black\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Rex</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The lesson: Don't rip off Deal Or No Deal</strong></p> <p>As a simple rule of thumb, if Ant &amp; Dec are hosting your show, and you're giving away \u00a31m every night, and people still won't watch, then your format doesn't work; and in gameshows, format is everything. You need a mechanic: a set of rules which create jeopardy and reward skill. In that respect, a successful format is like a sport. The first series of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/red-or-black\" title=\"\">Red Or Black</a>, however, rested on the central conceit of blind chance. A chimp or a plank of wood would have exactly the same chance of winning as a sentient human being. They might as well have called it Lucky Chimp, or Planks Win Prizes. The producers of Red Or Black are all smart and talented people, and introduced skill into series two, but by then the ship had sunk. You can see where the mistake came from. Red Or Black attempted \u2013 as did Channel 5's Heads Or Tails and ITV's The Colour Of Money \u2013 to rip off the magic formula of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/mar/13/deal-or-no-deal-gambling-c4\" title=\"\">Deal Or No Deal</a>. But Deal Or No Deal is not really about luck. It's about knowing when to quit. It is essentially \"stick or twist\" in the same way as any job or relationship you've ever had is. What man, when his mind turns to marriage, hasn't thought: \"It's a lovely offer, but perhaps I should just open three more boxes?\" Even the guy behind Deal Or No Deal couldn't rip off Deal Or No Deal. After Deal \u2026 had been such a worldwide success, its creator Dick de Rijk found it easy to sell any new idea. This led to Show Me The Money, the UK pilot of which is the single worst piece of television I have ever seen. And I am including Don't Scare The Hare.</p> <h2>Petrolheads</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398397046\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/26/1351247705142/PETROLHEADS-008.jpg\" alt=\"PETROLHEADS\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Kieron McCarron</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kieron McCarron</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The lesson: Panel shows are much harder to make than they look</strong></p> <p>Panel shows are the fashionable end of the gameshow market, and are allowed to win Baftas. They require a central idea that will give you endless material, strong comic talent, and a team of great writers. But for every Have I Got News For You or QI, there is a litany of forgettable shows. The most cautionary example would be BBC2's Petrolheads, a short-lived motoring panel show hosted by Neil Morrissey. Through experience, I am willing to bet that before settling on Petrolheads as a title, they will have considered They Think It's All Rover, Have I Got Subarus For You and Never Mind The Clutch Box. Petrolheads should have been a cast-iron hit \u2013 the logic behind it was exemplary: people love Have I Got News For You, people love Top Gear, Neil Morrissey is a beloved comic actor. However the highlight of the first show was a round in which you watched Ronan Keating parallel park, and thus the Bafta committee remained untroubled. Other notable Have I Got News rip-offs include <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/julian-fellowes\" title=\"\">Julian Fellowes</a>'s BBC4 panel show about punctuation, genuinely called Never Mind The Full Stops; and The Answer Lies In The Soil, an ITV panel show effort that largely involved identifying seeds.</p> <h2>Shafted</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398397047\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/26/1351247849491/Shafted-008.jpg\" alt=\"Shafted\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shafted</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The lesson: Don't pick a massively unsuitable host</strong></p> <p>Some time in the early noughties, ITV aired a brand-new quiz show, Shafted. The show was perfectly serviceable, with a neat question mechanic, and an exciting \"share or shaft\" endgame where you could steal vast sums of money from your opponent. The floor was requisitely shiny and the music suitably ominous and jeopardy-friendly. A hit was smelled by all. But this was the era in which \"queen of mean\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2011/apr/23/anne-robinson-weakest-link-interview\" title=\"\">Anne Robinson</a> had convinced executives that the public wanted their TV shows presented by sneering bullies. So that hit was dashed by just three simple words: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2011/sep/23/robert-kilroy-silk-returns-interview\" title=\"\">Robert Kilroy-Silk</a>. The second the show began, everyone involved was hit by exactly the same revelation: \"Of course, absolutely nobody in the whole of Britain actually likes Robert Kilroy-Silk. We should have gone with Brian Conley.\" The same logic has seen quiz shows presented by Jeremy Kyle, Jerry Springer, John McEnroe and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/ann-widdecombe\" title=\"\">Ann Widdecombe</a>. (Interestingly, three of those four people are absolutely lovely. As is Barry from EastEnders.) The two very talented brains behind Shafted, David Flynn and Adam Adler, went on, separately, to invent two of the biggest gameshows of the last decade, The Million Pound Drop and The Cube. Tellingly, those were presented by masters of their craft, Davina McCall and Phillip Schofield.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>I am writing this in a dusty Portakabin on a tropical island, where we are currently making Prize Island, a brand-new gameshow for ITV. Do we have a hit on our hands? Considering I've just watched a couple from Birmingham win a fitted kitchen by bouncing off an enormous inflatable octopus, your guess is very much as good as mine.</p>",
  "<p>The UK government has reiterated that it does not believe military action against Iran would be appropriate at the moment, following the disclosure that Britain has rebuffed US requests to use UK military bases to support the buildup of forces in the Gulf.</p> <p>Downing Street said: \"We are working closely with the US with regard to UK bases\" but \"the government does not think military action is the right course at this point of time\".</p> <p>David Cameron made a lengthy speech last week urging Israel to show restraint, and pointing to the way in which sanctions are having an impact on the Iranian economy.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/25/uk-reject-us-request-bases-iran\" title=\"\">The Guardian has been told</a> that US diplomats have also lobbied for the use of British bases in Cyprus, and for permission to fly from US bases on Ascension Island in the Atlantic and Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, both of which are British territories.</p> <p>The US approaches are part of contingency planning over the nuclear standoff with Tehran, but British ministers have so far reacted coolly. On Friday, Downing Street said such contingency planning was something that was done as a matter of routine.</p> <p>They have pointed US officials to legal advice drafted by the attorney general's office and which has been circulated to Downing Street, the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence.</p> <p>It states that providing assistance to forces that could be involved in a pre-emptive strike would be a clear breach of international law on the basis that Iran, which has consistently denied it has plans to develop a nuclear weapon, does not currently represent \"a clear and present threat\".</p> <p>\"The UK would be in breach of international law if it facilitated what amounted to a pre-emptive strike on Iran,\" said a senior Whitehall source. \"It is explicit. The government has been using this to push back against the Americans.\"</p> <p>Sources said the US had yet to make a formal request, and that they did not believe an acceleration towards conflict was imminent or more likely. The discussions so far had been to scope out the British position, they said.</p> <p>\"But I think the US has been surprised that ministers have been reluctant to provide assurances about this kind of upfront assistance,\" said one source. \"They'd expect resistance from senior Liberal Democrats, but it's Tories as well.

  "<h2>Exhibition of the week: Seduced by Art \u2013 Photography Past and Present</h2> <p>If the <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Gallery</a> was New York's <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/\" title=\"\">Metropolitan Museum</a> it would have a rich photography department alongside its collection of paintings. Its younger London sister museum, the <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">V&amp;A</a>, does have such a collection. But at the National Gallery, paintings hang in solitary splendour \u2013 oil on canvas is king. So this is a revolutionary event, a <a href=\"http://www.artfund.org/what-to-see/exhibitions/2012/10/31/seduced-by-art-photography-past-and-present\" title=\"\">direct encounter between photography and painting</a>, at a gallery that has always stood for the pure daub. It emphasises two moments in the story of photography: the mid-19th century and the present day.

  "<p>Anyone tempted to get indignant on learning for the first time today that Winston Churchill proposed shooting leading Nazis in 1945 rather than putting them on trial should first ponder the fact that how the allies eventually treated their defeated enemies at Nuremberg was widely criticised at the time as victors' justice, a lynching party even. Courts can always be pretty rough places, that's still obvious in 2012.</p> <p>As Ian Cobain reports,<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/26/britain-execution-nuremberg-nazi-leaders\" title=\"\"> the war-time prime minister had long thought that Hitler and his henchfolk should be bumped off</a> if caught alive, the law being squared if necessary by an act of attainder passed in parliament. Stalin and Roosevelt thought trials would be better \u2013 FDR because that's what US public opinion would want, Stalin because he had extensive experience of the value of show trials for propaganda purposes.</p> <p>What the newly released papers don't appear to confirm is that at their Tehran conference in 1943 \u2013 Iran was a divided Soviet-UK zone of influence \u2013 Stalin had proposed shooting 50,000 to 100,000 German officers, the sort of thing he'd done to the Poles in the Katyn Forest in 1940.</p> <p>FDR joked that perhaps 49,000 would do, but Churchill, a former fighting soldier himself, recoiled in horror that soldiers would be shot for doing their duty by their country \u2013 he'd rather be \"taken out into the courtyard and shot\" himself. Later in the war FDR's heart hardened when, at Yalta, he saw for himself what German occupation had done.</p> <p>In the event, 23 top Nazis were initially tried in 1945-46 \u2013 including G\u00f6ring, whose suicide pill cheated the hangman \u2013 and sentenced, 12 to death, seven to prison and three acquitted. Martin Bormann was absent, never caught despite repeated claims by the London tabloids. Two hundred or so lesser officials and soldiers were tried later at Nuremberg, 2,000 in normal courts. The basics are all <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Trials\" title=\"\">here</a>. Similar trials were held in Tokyo.</p> <p>It all fitted the public's angry, understandable desire for retribution against those who had launched a war that caused so much death and destruction, far more savage than had been realised until the post-war debris was assessed. Nuremberg became the precedent for all sorts of international jurisdiction, up to and including the international criminal court (ICC), most of it welcome, little of it free of controversy.</p> <p>But right from the start there was always unease. Harlan Fiske Stone, a member of the US supreme court, said Robert Jackson, the chief US prosecutor, was away \"conducting his high-grade lynching party in Nuremberg\". Not that Stone minded what was done to the Nazis, he just didn't want justice to be tainted by it in fraudulent trials.</p> <p>Why? Because all sorts of indefensible things had to be conceded. Some of the charges were retrospective; others should have been levied against the Soviets who had taken part in the invasion and partition of Poland \u2013 the cause of the war in 1939 \u2013 and done dreadful things both at home and abroad. It presented false testimony to cover up complicity. Normally inadmissible evidence was admitted, no appeals were allowed. And plenty more.</p> <p>So perhaps Churchill's plan for summary executions had the merit of lacking hypocrisy, unacceptable though it was in the new world of international war emerging from the ruins of 1945. But international tribunals of one kind or another remain open to the charges of partiality, of victors' justice. Serbian defendants at The Hague routinely complain about it; critics of Tony Blair and George Bush, who led the 2003 invasion of Iraq, say they should be in the dock there, too.</p> <p>The charge of \"substituting power for principle\" \u2013 made about Nuremberg in 1945 \u2013 lingers on. Imperfect justice is better than anarchy or the assertion that might is right, the prevailing principle for most of humanity during most of recorded history.</p> <p>But it's always messy. If you missed <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-20036674\" title=\"\">Conrad Black's interview with Newsnight's Jeremy Paxman </a>this week you will enjoy it. In a series of interviews on his return to Britain, the jailed Daily Telegraph tycoon is spectacularly self-deluding as well as abusive. Paxo can \u2013 and does \u2013 defend himself with ease, against a more appropriate target for his disdain than young female Treasury ministers.</p> <p>Yet Black's attack on the US justice system (a \"fraudulent, fascistic conveyor belt of a corrupt system\") and its propensity to lock people up \u2013 it has 5% of the world's population but 20% of its prisoners \u2013 is not something merely to be shrugged off.</p> <p>News that<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/26/christopher-tappin-us-plea-deal\" title=\"\"> Christopher Tappin</a>, the British businessman accused of breaking the arms embargo to Iran, is close to doing a plea-bargaining deal with prosecutors in Houston, Texas (he was extradited), which may save him years in a brutish prison.</p> <p>Is that justice? I don't know, but one of the NatWest Three \u2013 convicted in similar circumstances in the US \u2013 is quoted as saying that a US prosecutor can become \"judge, jury and executioner\" by threatening a suspect with heinous charges but settling for a quick and cheap compromise. As Black points out to Paxo, US conviction rates are very high.</p> <p>Closer to home I wasn't wildly enthusiastic at the prosecution of PC Alex MacFarlane for what is called a racially aggravated public order offence \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/oct/25/pc-alex-macfarlane-jury-discharged\" title=\"\">you can read the case here</a> \u2013 on the basis of what I have read in the Guardian. As I often remind readers, you have to have been in court to understand exactly what happened, but two juries failed to agree and the authorities have now given up.</p> <p>Some people will think the failure to convict an outrage, others will be outraged that the case was ever brought. Meanwhile I'd love to know why the Belgian authorities imposed a news blackout on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/26/british-oil-executive-shot-brussels\" title=\"\">shooting of British oil executive</a>, Nicholas Moxford, outside a Brussels restaurant on 14 October \u2013 almost two weeks ago.</p> <p>A shooting in a street is a secret? Well, well. But justice is funny stuff. We strive for enforceable international laws and standards, but we all do it our own way.</p>",
  "<p>The sayings of Bill Shankly would, and indeed have, filled a book. What may not be realised, however, is that in most cases he was being perfectly serious. When Shankly declared football to be more important than mere matters of life and death, he meant it.</p> <p>Which is not to say that his tongue was never in his cheek. Sitting next to Shanks on the Liverpool bus as it made its way from Speke airport in the early hours after one European trip, a quiet doze was interrupted by a nudge: \"Davie, I think you should know that we're passing Everton's training ground. But don't worry. So long as you stay on the coach you'll not be contaminated.\"</p> <p>At the moment Liverpool supporters may find themselves hoping that whatever Everton have got is highly contagious. Sunday's first Merseyside derby of the season finds David Moyes's side beginning to acquire the attributes of past Liverpool teams while Brendan Rodgers is struggling to restore any kind of identity to what is happening at Anfield.</p> <p>True, Liverpool beat Everton twice in the league last season, winning 2-0 at Goodison and 3-0 in the return game, and 2-1 in their FA Cup semi-final. But they finished behind their rivals in the Premier League and are at present loitering in the bottom half of the table while Everton are in the top four.</p> <p>There was a time when the results of meetings between Liverpool and Everton reverberated throughout the land. In the 60s and early 70s Shankly's Liverpool and Harry Catterick's Everton regularly shared centre stage with the Uniteds of Manchester and Leeds. Then, while Liverpool found even greater success under Bob Paisley, Everton lost their way and did not return from the wilderness until Howard Kendall restored the league title to Goodison in the mid-80s.</p> <p>Now what was once one of English football's most eagerly awaited derbies has become a nostalgic sideshow, left behind by the millions poured into the coffers of Chelsea and Manchester City and the enduringly powerful presence of Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United. Even if City's historic knack of shooting themselves in the foot proved itself alive and well against Ajax on Wednesday, at least the Etihad is watching Champions League football again while Liverpool have been slumming it in the Europa Thursday League.</p> <p>It seems safe to say that neither Everton nor Liverpool will win the Premier League this season, or in the foreseeable future. Getting into the Champions League via a top-four finish is the best that either can expect and, for Everton at least, that is looking a distinct possibility. With the other likely contestants for fourth place, Arsenal and Tottenham, feeling the effects of selling their better players, this could be Goodison's chance.</p> <p>The way Moyes has organised Everton teams since taking over from Walter Smith 10 years ago is reminiscent of Shankly's early days at Anfield. When Shanks became Liverpool's manager in 1959 the team were slumped in the old Second Division. Shankly took them back to the First at the third attempt and by the mid-60s they were reaching the semi-finals of the European Cup.</p> <p>Like Shankly, Moyes has restored quality and consistency to Everton's football through his painstaking development of the team allied to a clear idea of how he wants them to play. Given Goodison's relatively modest finances he has been unable to compete with the bigger spenders, not that he would have been likely to sign Andy Carroll for \u00a335m or even a fraction of that amount.</p> <p>Then again, having given the young Wayne Rooney his chance, the Everton manager's frustration at seeing his prodigy leave for Manchester United in 2004 because Old Trafford's offer could not be refused can only be imagined. Managing on modest resources is hard enough when a team are simply seeking to stay in the Premier League. If Moyes gets Everton into the Champions League he would surely be a shoo-in for manager of the season.</p> <p>It is worth noting that during his time at Goodison Liverpool have had five managers whereas during the 24 years of their greatest success they had just two, Shankly and Paisley. Liverpool, moreover, are on their second set of American owners while Everton's chairman, Bill Kenwright, echoes Coronation Street rather than Wall Street.</p> <p>Even if Liverpool win Sunday's derby, Everton, in terms of continuity, managerial longevity and a clear notion of what they are about on the field, are at present walking alone.</p> <p><em>This article was amended on 26 October to reflect the fact that Liverpool also beat Everton in their 2011-12 FA Cup semi-final</em></p>",

They will only end up competing head on with established online companies who sell better products, cheaper, faster and with a standard of customer service light years beyond Argos.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19043177 \"><strong>besidethesea</strong></a> added:<br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I live near three Argos stores within roughly a six mile radius. I've bought odd bits from them over the years, never had any problems, items bought did exactly what I wanted and they were reasonably priced.<br>I do look online but I picked up a copy of their latest catalogue a few weeks back because sometimes I just want to flick through the pages rather than fire up the laptop. :-)</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19044713\"><strong>leebeatsthedevil</strong></a> said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I know what a godsend Argos is in some places - if you need something, they will more than likely have it - and be the only place to get it (mind you, Tesco is replacing them in so many areas). Their actual physical stores are exactly the same as they were 30 years ago, tired and depressing - they should turn it into some kind of coffee shop where you can relax while you wait. I don't see people complaining about the Ikea catalogue - some people do actually like catalogues, and shock horror, some people still don't have the internet. Still, if they are to compete with Amazon, agreed - that's an enormous task. Argos to me feels studenty and first-time buyerish (the second of which I am, the first of which i was many moons ago)</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19047102\"><strong>GuillotinesRUs</strong></a> said:<br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Argos is a victim of changing shopping habits. I have used Argos in the past but I must admit the last time I was in one of their stores must be a couple of years ago. Now if I need something I just type in a search on the Internet, find what I need and then look for the most competitive deal.<br>I can't really think what Argos's USP might be, there are so many differant outlets on the Net now days, the purchaser is spoilt for choice.</p> </blockquote> <p><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19049118\"><strong>dash4cash</strong></a> added this insight:<br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I briefly worked with Argos last year on a study to re-invent their catalogue digitally and the core problem was the sheer cost and logistics of physical catalogue production. What I learnt was staggering: it takes months and months to produce (most of the year, in fact); the work is split across the internal Argos catalogue team and multiple design and production agencies; it costs a fortune to ship and print; it couldn't be updated easily; they can't add anymore products to it because it would become too heavy and unwieldy (which adds to shipping costs); and the catalogue was becoming less relevant with the rise of digital shopping.<br>In terms of competing with Amazon, they were plainly aware they were a catalogue business and, without it, they would possibly sink into obscurity if they couldn't compete with Amazon on price. But their advantage is their network of local stores, which is a effectively a decentralised network of stock warehouses; they can satisfy customers who want a product very quickly, faster and in a more predictable fashion than even same day shipping.<br>In short, how they redefine their catalogue and still use their store network is the challenge they'll have to surmount to safeguard their future</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19041272\"><strong>BeckyDavidson</strong></a> said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Digital or non-digital, they're a pretty cruddy outfit.<br>My last online purchase at Argos: Habitat salt and pepper grinders. Same price as Habitat online minus the \u00a35 p+p. One arrived without protective packaging, a dent and a gummy sticker print - had to arrange for a replacement to be delivered to my local store.<br>The online purchase before that - a remote controlled car. Car was fine but the recommended batteries were the wrong ones. Contacted Argos to tell them. They said thanks, we'll get that changed on the website but they wouldn't refund the batteries I had no use for as I'd got them in another store.<br>And the product photos are misleading too</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19041794\"><strong>FortescueMundy</strong></a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Has anyone tried ordering something from Argos online? I ordered an air conditioning unit as my old one had broken down. Fortunately, the summer was not that hot, as it took a whole month for me to get the unit. I had to chase over the telephone more than once. The second time I rang I was told the unit had arrived, but was faulty. On reflection, I felt that this was just an excuse. I know that these days, retailers use the 'just in time' method of acquiring the goods they are going to sell, but they need to do better if they want to compete.<br>The next time I need a large article which Argos classes as 'home delivery' I will be going to somewhere like Curry's and taking it home with me. I also find that the in-store service (supposedly quicker than going to a conventional store) is often slow.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19042109   \"><strong>SuperClive</strong></a> said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Where are the 75 stores under threat? While the (ENORMOUS) catalogue is a bit of a throwback, it's very handy to buy online and then pop into a high street store to pick your stuff up, rather than being messed around by couriers. A retreat into retail parks would be a mistake.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19043062\"><strong>HelenWilsonMK</strong></a> said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I'd of thought they should be looking at using the Homebase stores for collection and ordering points would see the end for the need of all Argos stores nationwide. Maybe supplement the homebase stores with entering into a arrangement with struggling retailers like WH Smiths for ordering and collection points in-store.<br>The current way the stores are run is redundant given most of the tatty bits of crockery ect... can be brought cheaper from the local supermarket these days. All they need now is a centralized distribution hub and become a sort of RS of tat using the internet, colletion/ordering concessions and phone ordering.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Memories of analogue:</h2> <p>With this being the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/24/analogue-television-switchover-northern-ireland?commentpage=1#comment-19050099\">last week of analogue television and the end of Ceefax</a>, our readers shared their memories and favourite thoughts.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19042473 \"><strong>tumteatum</strong></a> said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I loved ceefax and even bought a flight off teletext (page 81/360). Quick, easy to digest facts be it the news, sport, top 40 etc. It was far superior to the net or red button in what it offered. I mourne the loss of analogue. I had a great, little portable in my bedroom with a tempermental ariel that we had to prop up on the headboard ... but no more. Now we have one tv in the front room - the sound fades in and out, and we get nothing at all in bad weather - and that is assuming there is anything to watch - I was happy with 4 channels. One of the saddest things was my mum saying recently that since she lost the use of her portable, she no longer has the choice to watch programmes she likes and she has to sit night after night staring at a screen controlled by someone else. She cannot be the only one. Bah humbug to the techno-lovers, with their overpriced, sweatshop gadgetry sucking up resources and energy - some changes are not for the best.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19041066\"><strong>PeterHove</strong></a> said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Magic Box on BBC Northern Ireland and UTV last night, a LIVE show that celebrated 60 years of TV in the province and marked the end of analogue television. Some great memories.<br>I first saw CEEFAX on August 15 1981. I was in a bar at the Copthorne Hotel at Copthorne in Sussex, waiting for a table in the restaurant. A keen cricket fan, I noticed the TV in the bar was showing the England Test match score. I pointed this out to my dad, also a cricket fan. My initial thought was how it brilliant ts was that the viewer could call up information, like a newspaper, on their television screen.<br>Earlier that year, we had only just \"gone\" colour at home, and bought a video recorder. Both the TV and the video had remote controls, even though the video remote was actually connected by a cable, which we would occasionally trip on. But the TV didn't have teletext.<br>It was two later - in 1983 - that we first had CEEFAX and ITV's rival service, Oracle, at home. The new TV we rented at that time also had stereo! We paid \u00a326 a month to rental firm DER, as I recall.<br>Back on CEEFAX - my favourite pages were 340 for the cricket, 302 for football, and the news pages.<br>In later life, as a journalist and government press officer, I used CEEFAX to keep me up to date with the news, professionally.<br>When I was a press officer at the Health and Safety Executive in the 90s and 00s, the HSE's director-general said he realised the importance of the out-of-hours press office when he saw three of the top five news stories on CEEFAX were about health and safety.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19040812    \"><strong>Jimmyji</strong></a> added: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For news I consulted Ceefax till the last day on BBC World program.

These failures are themselves hugely expensive over the life of an individual, but state care also costs as it is being given - up to \u00a350k a year. Grandparents are often the best option to provide stability, to love and nurture damaged children but the state needs to recognise that taking on the responsibility of a second family when entering retirement places a huge burden on people. The long-term savings where a child can be placed with a family member needs recognising with a statutory and non-means tested benefit. We do not means test the allowances paid to foster carers and owe it to family members caring for a child who would otherwise be in the care of the state to recompense them for the additional costs they are bearing.</p> </blockquote> <p> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18986499\"><strong>Shelly James </strong></a> said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Many of the children taken on by kinship carers need specialised help, some are traumatised and some are dealing with bereavement, a lot are on the autistic spectrum and many suffer from Attachment Disorder. You would not ask a foster carer to do the same out of love, children still need to be clothed and fed. Foster children get fast track access to all the specialised help they need, Kinship carers on the other hand are in limbo, the children are treated as third class citizens. The financial side of things is only one side of the story, there is the emotional support needed as well. How would you deal with no longer being a grandparent but now the main carer, how would you approach the child's school when they are dealing with family dynamics but because of the various laws now in place, they don't actually know how to explain to other class members why a certain child does not live with their parents.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18986982\"><strong>paulinemackie</strong></a> added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My husband and I had to take out a residency order for our grandaughter who was 18 months at the time,Mum unable to cope and a violent partner,I could'nt work as going through treatment at the time,it cost us \u00a3340 for the solicitor as residency is a civil action,a few weeks after we had her with us I needed major surgery,our wonderful health visitor got her into a day nursery for 5 hours a day,I was unable to get out due to op and ill health,I phoned social services to ask for help with transport to get our grandaughter to nursrey and back,the answer astonished me \" There is nothing we do when grandparents are in situ\"My husband was fortunate that he had a good boss who allowed him to leave work to take her to nursery and again to pick her up.<br>My husband only earned \u00a3240 a week and this was just 5 years ago,we contacted our MP as we had lost out on legal aid as civil actions had a high ceiling at the time,we almost qualified for it,however as my husband is also a volunteer coastguard,who's income from this was only paid by callout,some months maybe \u00a350 another \u00a35,she was very sorry,what she did manage to do was to get us Kinship Allowance from our LA the grand sum of \u00a323 a week,why did'nt the social worker tell me about this?<br>Our story ends well,within 18 months our daughter was able to function and care for the wee one and they have a brillaint relationship now,we did it out of love and care,but some extra income would have been handy.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18990973\"><strong>northernglam</strong></a> said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As a parent of a disabled child who has to give up my career to care - because the childcare and education services available were completely unsuitable, yes there is support, but carers allowance and DLA do not make up for the loss of 30 years earnings and the pension I would have had. \u00a355 a week carers allowance does not cover even 1/4 of the average mortgage now, let alone bills and food, running a car, replacing a washing machine or house repairs. Yes we manage, mainly because we had paid down a lot of the mortgage before the disabled child came along but we will have to live on a basic pension, our non disabled children cannot go on school trips and will not get any of the family support we expected to be able to give them to go to university.

I found that i talked too fast and since i work on the phones for a living it is much more conductive for me to just be normal and make sure i have enough sleep.

Firstly, what the author fails to state here is that modafinil is known to act as an anti-depressant - its not that you necessarily find the work more interesting, it is that your mood can be enhanced. In fact, for certina types of study, personally, i think that modafinil doesn't quite cut it. For mechanical - revision style - learning of facts etc., modafinil is a good drug, but when it comes to thinking about something properly and creatively, it isnt as effective. As a revision aid i think that it can certianly better performance ofr the average person. Another thing the author doesn't explicitly mention here is that this stuff can SERIOUSLY affect your sleep. If you take it at 8 in the morning, it can stop you sleeping that night, though im sure this varies from person to person.</p> </blockquote> <h2>'Parasite' porn websites stealing images and videos posted by young people</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/22/parasite-porn-websites-images-videos\">Children and young people are posting thousands of sexually explicit images of themselves and their peers online</a>, which are then being stolen by porn websites, according to the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF).</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19005134\"><strong>trickywicked</strong></a> said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can imagine as a teenager it can seem to be a bit of an adult thrill to use images of yourself to tease the opposite sex, without fully understanding the risks, it can seem so simple and almost safe to do.

I recently talked to one young girl whose friend had posted a picture of herself in her underwear on Facebook, and that picture had turned up in other places. \"She should have restricted it to friends only\", she said. So I asked her how many Facebook friends she had, and of course it ran into the hundreds.

I have seen this contribute to truancy, emotional instability and academic decline.<br>I read with sadness about the suicide of Amanda Todd, a girl in just this situation, and watched the moving video she had made.

I have a wife, a teenage daughter and a job I feel passionately about. To have any of these relationships threatened because of a mistake, a failure of judgement or a betrayal of trust when I was at school would be horrific. There will be individuals who have no issues with their actions, but many, especially young people, may not have realised the long-lasting impact of their decisions. If indeed it was their decision.<br>Raising awareness of this is one of the few ways to protect people. We protect the weak and vulnerable.

Parents do have a responsibility to ensure their children understand these things and all the other little rules of thumb that help people get by. However, there is a flip side to these horror stories which is that people cared and were judgmental about the whole thing. If we all treated someone having naked pictures online as no big deal and just one of those things that can happen when a bit of risky fun goes wrong, like breaking your arm falling off your bike, then it wouldn't be a big deal. It is only because we tell people that it is somehow shameful or immoral to have images of your body available for all to see, even if it wasn't your intention, that people are hurt. We should learn to shrug these things off. If we condemn anyone we should condemn those who share these images more widely than intended.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Europe's lost generation costs 153 billion euros a year</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/22/europe-lost-generation-costs-study\">A lost generation of 14 million out-of-work and disengaged young Europeans</a> is costing member states a total of \u20ac153bn (\u00a3124bn) a year \u2013 1.2% of the EU's gross domestic product \u2013 the largest study of the young unemployed has concluded.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18998343\"><strong>Acidfairyy</strong></a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I'm 25 and working part time; am on Jobseeker's to top up my wages whilst I look for fulltime employment.

  "<p>The Bank of England has warned that a full breakup of Britain's banks might ultimately be needed to prevent their problems wrecking the economy or burdening the taxpayer.</p> <p>Andrew Haldane, Threadneedle Street's director for financial stability, expressed doubts that current proposals would be sufficient to tackle the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2012/oct/01/break-up-banks-question-four-years\" title=\"\">\"too big to fail\" issue</a> that has dogged the financial sector since the crisis of 2007-08.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2012/100.aspx\" title=\"\">In a speech to the Institute of Economic Affairs</a> on Thursday night, Haldane said current initiatives were a step in the right direction but did not go far enough.</p> <p>Ultimately, he said, banks might need to have their activities curtailed by tough capital requirements, limits on their size or a modern Glass-Steagall Act, the 1930s law that separated investment from retail banking in the US.</p> <p>Haldane said banks had increased in size dramatically over past decades and this \u2013 together with consolidation and concentration of the industry \u2013 had created expectations of state bailouts in times of trouble.</p> <p>\"These expectations generate lower funding costs, in particular for the largest banks, which in turn encourages further expansion and concentration, worsening the too-big-to-fail dilemma,\" Haldane said.</p> <p>In 2009, following the government support that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Haldane said estimates of the implicit taxpayer subsidy to the world's banks came to $700bn (\u00a3435bn). This implied that \"too big to fail had become hardwired into the structure and pricing of the financial system\".</p> <p>Subsequent reforms of the banks have involved forcing them to hold more capital so that they can absorb losses, ensuring that mechanisms are in place to wind them up without bringing down other institutions with them \u2013 so-called living wills \u2013 and proposals to prevent the speculative activities of banks damaging their high street operations.</p> <p>Haldane said the extra capital surcharges agreed internationally would leave much of the implicit taxpayer subsidy intact. He flagged two possible problems with more effective wind-up regimes: that they would lead to even greater concentration of banks and that there was a risk governments would take the safe option of a bailout if a big bank ran into trouble, rather than face the threat of a systemic meltdown.</p> <p>Haldane said that was concerning, because there was already evidence that recent bailouts had increased government debt to levels that \"may be a significant drag on medium-term growth\".</p> <p>Since the crisis, teams of experts <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/14/vickers-report-banking-reforms-dilution\" title=\"\">led by Sir John Vickers in the UK</a>, Paul Volcker in the US and Erkki Liikanen in the EU, have been looking at ways of separating investment and retail banking.</p> <p>In order to prevent cross-contamination, Haldane said \"full and faithful implementation of the spirit as well as the letter of the Volcker, Vickers and Liikanen plans\" will be needed.</p> <p>A true separation of capital and culture within the big banks, together with the elimination of \"too big to fail\" would \"require entirely separate governance, risk and balance sheet management on either side of the ringfence \u2026 Only time will tell whether cultural separation can be achieved under the existing structural reform proposals.\"</p> <p>Noting that current reform proposals may prove insufficient, Haldane outlined a number of more radical suggestions. Increasing the level of capital that banks have to hold to several times the current suggested levels would \"reduce materially expected system-wide losses\".</p> <p>In addition, limits could be put on the size of banks, since despite claims by the industry that bigger institutions were more efficient and less costly to operate, there was no evidence that economies of scale applied to banks above $100bn.</p> <p>Haldane said a full separation of investment and commercial banking \u2013 \"a modern-day Glass-Steagall Act\" \u2013 would lessen the risk of basic banking activities being starved of human or financial capital. Increasing competition by removing the barriers to entry would also help to reduce banking concentration and with it the \"too big to fail\" problem.</p>",

It offers 30 yoga classes in HD video form, with the ability to stitch the videos together into custom routines, and browse photos of more than 280 poses.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/journals-mama-mae-leelee/id569755982?mt=8\">The Journals of Mama Mae &amp; LeeLee</a></h2> <p>If music and children are two of the big themes on iOS this fortnight, then The Journals of Mama Mae &amp; LeeLee brings them together.

That means a location-based guide to restaurants, cafes, playgrounds, parks, pools, toy and clothes shops and other businesses for parents on the go.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/acoustik/id562902303?mt=8\">Acoustik</a></h2> <p>Not a book-app, but an audiobook-app. Acoustik is the work of Findaway World, as a way for people to listen to audiobooks in the Acoustik format.

It's based on the Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) format that's being used in a number of schools, with the idea being that students create their own tests across a range of subjects, and also find those created by others. Better than flashcards, claim its developers.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/csn/id553219031?mt=8\">CSN</a></h2> <p>This app will only be of interest to fans of rock supergroup Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, but it's noteworthy for its business model too.

It's based on the museum's Hollywood Costume exhibition, and offers up 16 famous film costumes to (virtually) try on, then share the results on social networks.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/striiv-smart-pedometer-activity/id564936523?mt=8\">Striiv Smart Pedometer</a></h2> <p>There are an increasing number of fitness apps that include pedometer functions for iOS. Striiv takes a slightly different tack to most though, by including \"activity-based games\" to motivate your walking and running. That includes challenges (\"burn the calories in a cupcake\") as well as trophies and a virtual island to populate. It also works with calorie-counting service MyFitnessPal on the nutrition side.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/inkly-cards/id557932128?mt=8\">Inkly Cards</a></h2> <p>We've seen several startups launch apps to turn photos into physical postcards over the last few years. Inkly Cards is different: it's about making traditional greetings cards with an actual handwritten message inside. That means scribbling on real paper then taking a photo of it to upload with the card order. Independent artists and designers provide the card designs.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/my-first-orchestra-app-hd/id568583429?mt=8\">My First Orchestra App HD</a></h2> <p>Another musical children's app, this comes from classical label Naxos, as a way of introducing kids aged four and upwards to the different instruments in an orchestra.

  "<p>China's foreign ministry has accused the New York Times of smearing the country by reporting that the premier Wen Jiabao's extended family has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/business/global/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html\" title=\"\">controlled assets worth at least $2.7bn</a> (\u00a31.67bn).</p> <p>A spokesman, Hong Lei, said the report \"blackens China's name and has ulterior motives\". Authorities have also blocked the news organisation's main and Chinese-language websites and banned searches for \"New York Times\" in English and Chinese on microblogs.</p> <p>\"China manages the internet in accordance with laws and rules,\" Hong told reporters at a daily briefing when asked why the sites were inaccessible.</p> <p>The New York Times reported that several of Wen's close relatives had become extremely wealthy since his ascent to leadership. But in many cases their holdings were obscured by layers of partnerships and investment vehicles involving friends, colleagues or business partners, it said, in a detailed and lengthy account based on an extensive review of company and regulatory filings.</p> <p>A single investment held on paper by Wen's 90-year-old mother Yang Zhiyun \u2013 a retired schoolteacher \u2013 was worth $120m five years ago, the New York Times said. It added it was unclear if Yang was aware of the holdings in her name.</p> <p>The report is embarrassing not only for Wen himself \u2013 who comes from a modest background and is widely seen as the sympathetic, populist face of the government \u2013 but for the party. It is the latest in a string of unwelcome revelations about the vast wealth amassed by those around senior leaders.</p> <p>Authorities blocked the Bloomberg website earlier this year after it exposed the multimillion-dollar assets held by the extended family of Xi Jinping, heir-apparent to the presidency. The news agency has also reported that relatives of the disgraced politician Bo Xilai accumulated at least $136m in assets.</p> <p>Many people \u2013 particularly among the elite \u2013 had been aware of rumours about Wen's relatives, but the full detail of the report and the scale of their assets is striking. The timing is also sensitive, given that the once-a-decade leadership transition is weeks away.</p> <p>But the blocking of the websites and censorship on Chinese microblogs means that many may remain unaware of the New York Times report.</p> <p>Several users commented on the article on the Sina Weibo service, but the remarks were quickly deleted. A BBC news report was blacked out in Beijing as it referred to the article.</p> <p>Wen has repeatedly stressed the need to curb corruption, urging leaders to ensure their families and associates do not abuse government influence, and pushed for officials to disclose the assets of their immediate families.</p> <p>Such declarations are not made public and the Times said four-fifths of the assets they found were held by relatives such as his mother, younger brother and various in-laws \u2013 none of whom would be covered by the party rules.</p> <p>A former government colleague of Wen's, who spoke anonymously, told the Times: \"In the senior leadership, there's no family that doesn't have these problems \u2026 His enemies are intentionally trying to smear him by letting this leak out.\"</p> <p>A US diplomatic cable obtained by WikiLeaks, dating from 2007, quoted an executive in Shanghai as saying: \"Wen is disgusted with his family's activities, but is either unable or unwilling to curtail them.\"</p> <p>In March, the prime minister made a point of telling reporters at his annual press conference that he had \"never pursued personal gain\", adding that while he had faced criticism, \"history will have the final say\".</p> <p>Wen's mother's shares, and those of other relatives, were held via an investment vehicle, Taihong, run by Duan Weihong, a wealthy businesswoman close to Wen's wife. Weihong told the Times that the investments were actually her own but she had sought a low profile so asked relatives to find other people to hold the shares on her behalf; they had by \"accident\" and without her knowledge chosen the prime minister's relatives.</p> <p>Wen's wife, Zhang Beili, who is rarely seen with her husband, works in the diamond trade. Their son Winston Wen runs New Horizon Capital, now one of China's biggest private equity funds.</p> <p>His wife Yang Xiaomeng told the Times: \"Everything that has been written about him has been wrong.</p> <p>\"He's really not doing that much business any more.\"</p> <p>The Times said members of Wen's family had declined to comment or did not respond.</p> <p>Separately, the Brookings Institution said the brother of the man expected to replace Wen Jiabao \u2013 Li Keqiang, already vice-premier \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-25/china-leader-s-job-at-odds-with-tobacco-ties-brookings-says-1-.html\" title=\"\">should be moved from his post as a senior official at China's state-owned tobacco monopoly</a>. Li oversees public health as part of his duties.</p> <p>His younger brother Li Keming is deputy director of the tobacco body and Cheng Li, author of the Brookings report, suggested his role might have set back attempts to curb tobacco use in China.</p>",
  "<p>Law firms should not underestimate&#xa0;the immeasurable marketing potential of social media technologies. A recent <a href=\"http://www.lexisnexis.com/community/portal/lfmc/resourcepage.aspx?PostId=236206\" title=\"\">study </a>from Lexis Nexis shows that more than three-quarters of people looking for a lawyer in the US did so online and Facebook was the most popular resource used by consumers in their searches.</p> <p>The report concludes that social media, blogging and online legal forums are playing an increasingly significant role in the search for legal services. Are firms taking full advantage of social media? \"The vast majority of law firms do not understand social media and those that do typically are failing to use it in an effective way or have unrealistic expectations of how social media fits within the marketing mix,\" says consultant Mark Tillison.</p> <p>Manchester firm <a href=\"http://www.pannone.com/\" title=\"\">Pannone</a> is one of the few that places a significant value on social media. \"Off-page is very important,\" says Digital marketing director Steve Simpson. \"Getting quality links back to the site for our chosen terms,blogging on our website, articles and really important press releases, and all these then get pushed via 'social', Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google plus and, where suitable, YouTube.\"</p> <p>The rewards are tangible according to Simpson, because over 30 per cent of the firm's business is generated from the firm's website. Pannone may, however, be an exception. Tillison says: \"There are a number of sites I've seen which are contemporary, easy to navigate, compelling and engage the user, but these are few and far between. Those that have positioned themselves in this way are almost certainly gaining business over their competitors.\"</p> <p>Though many law firms are missing a trick by largely ignoring the online world, some are starting to cotton on to the value of blogs which can be easily shared through social media. \"The benefits of blogs are two-fold: they help clients find you, and they reassure those near to making a purchase that your firm will be able to help them, says Mike Bean of Isaac Parker Communications. \"If you were a divorce lawyer you might give your right arm to be ranked highly for the term 'divorce lawyer' in Google, but actually, clients close to purchase tend to use longer, multi-word search terms like 'how to file for a divorce'. Blogs help you get found for these searches and the posts you write give clients-to-be the reassurance that you will deliver a great service.\"</p> <p>Thomas Eggar launched a new website last month and social media&#xa0;has, says marketing executive Yasemin Kaynakci,&#xa0;played a huge part in planning, developing and monitoring its effectiveness: \"Law is a fast moving, newsworthy topic and the old ways of providing updates just don't appeal to our target audiences as much as they used to.\"</p> <p>The firm uses social media icons on its site to encourage users to share content and Twitter feed is a home page feature. Kaynakci says: \"We&#xa0;want&#xa0;to build communities&#xa0;around topics of interest&#xa0;by providing industry comment, events, blogs or news items that benefit existing and potential clients and other target audiences. We also believe it's vital to offer&#xa0;a&#xa0;mix of communication&#xa0;mediums that cater for different preferences.\"</p> <p>Thomas Eggar also uses video on its site, a feature that is under-utilised by law firms . Kaynakci explains: \"We want to take advantage&#xa0;of what technology can offer, and videos&#xa0;enable us to captivate our audience&#xa0;in a creative and unique way. Bite sized video feeds meet the needs of people today.\"</p> <p>Bond Pearce's site uses audio and video to communicate in a \"bespoke manner and with personality,\" says Emma Price, the firm's business development director. \"These features provide us with a different way to engage with our clients and contacts on a more personal level,\" she says. \"The new dynamic is that today, access to information is instantaneous and if you aren't providing it, then your clients will get it from a competitor.\"</p>",

A government-owned holding company, Directly Operated Railways, has been running services since then, with plans to return the franchise to the private sector in 2013.</p> <p><strong>Services</strong> East Coast currently operates services from London King's Cross to Yorkshire, the&#xa0;north-east&#xa0;and&#xa0;Scotland. Half-hourly services run from King's Cross to Leeds and Newcastle, with an hourly service continuing to Edinburgh. Glasgow, Aberdeen, Inverness, Hull, Lincoln, Skipton, Harrogate and Bradford are all served by infrequent services.</p> <p><strong>Ease of booking </strong>The East Coast website was easy to navigate, with no booking fee charges applied to purchases. First-class postage for tickets costs \u00a31.</p> <p><strong>Price</strong> York to London King's Cross: anytime single \u00a3124.50; anytime return \u00a3249; off-peak single \u00a393.10; off-peak return \u00a394.10.</p> <p><strong>Was it on time?</strong> Our test train departed King's Cross on time but arrived at York four minutes behind schedule. According to <a href=\"http://www.networkrail.co.uk/about/performance/\" title=\"\">Network Rail's statistics</a> 87.8% of East Coast services in the year to 13 October 2012 were described as \"punctual\" \u2013 that is arriving at their destination within 10 minutes of the scheduled time.</p> <p><strong>Seating</strong> The majority of carriages on the train were standard class, with each containing a small number of table seats with the rest in airline style.</p> <p><strong>Staff </strong>The on-board staff were polite and friendly, with frequent announcements about the facilities offered.</p> <p><strong>Facilities </strong>This East Coast service contained a full on-board cafe and trolley service. Items included coffee (\u00a32.20), tea (\u00a31.85), a bacon butty (\u00a33.55) and chocolate bars (80p), with a minimum card spend of \u00a35. Wi-Fi is available on board all services, free to passengers travelling in first class but costing \u00a34.95 an hour or \u00a39.95 for 24-hours in standard class, although the latter are given 15 minutes of free internet access.</p> <p>The train was generally well kept, with on-board toilets in a clean and tidy condition.</p> <p><strong>Rating</strong> 7/10.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.grandcentralrail.com/\" title=\"Grand Central website\">Grand Central</a></h2> <p><strong>Background </strong>Grand Central is one of a handful of open-access operators running rail services in the UK. It was given approval to operate services <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2006/mar/24/transportintheuk.travelnews?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"Small-scale train operator given green signal on east coast\">between London and the north-east in 2006</a>, with its first trains running by the end of 2007. Founded by former British Rail area manager Ian Yeowart in 2000, Grand Central was sold to transport giant Arriva in November 2011.</p> <p><strong>Services </strong>Grand Central runs four daily services in each direction between London King's Cross and Sunderland, via Hartlepool and York. A fifth daily service is due to be added in December 2012. The firm also operates three services in either direction between London and Bradford, via Doncaster and Wakefield.</p> <p><strong>Ease of booking </strong>The Grand Central website contained plenty of information about its services and destinations, no booking fees were charged and first-class postage was offered free of charge.</p> <p><strong>Price </strong>York to London King's Cross: anytime single \u00a375; anytime return \u00a3120; off-peak single \u00a350; off-peak return \u00a385.</p> <p><strong>Was it on time? </strong>The service tested between York and King's Cross departed on time and arrived in the capital a minute ahead of schedule. Unfortunately, Grand Central punctuality statistics are not published by National Rail.</p> <p><strong>Seating </strong>The service had one first-class coach with the rest of the train taken up with standard class carriages. The standard coaches had a good mix of airline style and table seats, all with ample leg room.</p> <p><strong>Facilities </strong>The on-board cafe had a good range with competitive prices. Tea and coffee (\u00a31.50), a bacon butty (\u00a33) and chocolate bars (80p) were on offer, as well as playing cards and travel games. Passengers wishing to pay by card had a minimum spend of \u00a36. Wi-Fi is offered to all customers free of charge, while the on-board toilet facilities were more than adequate.</p> <p><strong>Staff </strong>The on-board crew were well-mannered, especially when confronted with a troublesome customer in the carriage. The on-board announcements, however, were perhaps too frequent for most people's tastes.</p> <p><strong>Rating</strong> 9/10.</p> <p><strong>Adam's verdict</strong> One of the few sections of UK railway to have more than one operator in direct competition, the York to London stretch is served by two competent providers in East Coast and Grand Central. East Coast is a considerably bigger firm and Grand Central was not able compete on the number of services offered, although it has already announced plans to add more in the near future.</p> <p>Walk-up prices were considerably cheaper on Grand Central, with anytime return tickets nearly \u00a3130 cheaper than its rival. However, both firms offer a wide range of cheaper advance tickets.</p> <p>The carriages on the Grand Central train were far roomier than those on East Coast, with more table seats available and considerably more leg room. Grand Central also offered free Wi-Fi and the prices of on-board snacks were far cheaper.</p> <p>Despite running fewer services, the lower prices mean Grand Central is worth waiting for.</p> <h2>Last week</h2> <p>We pitted <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/oct/19/itunes-blinkbox-which-better\" title=\"iTunes or blinkbox  which is better?\">iTunes against blinkbox</a> in the battle of the film downloads.

  "<p><em>David Pardey is the head of research and policy at the </em><a href=\"http://www.i-l-m.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Institute of Leadership and Management (ILM)</em></a></p> <p><strong>Think about employing staff virtually: </strong>Employing and managing people virtually is a great idea and opens up opportunities for some innovative employment practices. It also means you don't have the kind of control you would normally enjoy \u2013 simply seeing someone working, and being able to monitor their input and their output. Therefore, you need to be absolutely clear on what you will put in place. Do you want them working set hours \u2013 probably easier for your peace of mind, at least at first? Do you want them to log into a virtual private network (VPN) or have a morning phone call at the start of the working day? This is all about trust, and it's hard to trust someone you don't really know, so it's important that you establish clearly how you will go about working together from the start to build trust and move to a freer way of working.</p> <p><strong>Your staff will have a different perspective on your business:</strong> Remember that you and they have a very different emotional relationship with the business. For you, work and your personal identity are identical \u2013 the business is you and you are the business. For employees the relationship is essentially transactional \u2013 they work and you pay them. Who they are isn't defined by you employing them, it's just one part of their life, and probably not the most important emotionally. This means that you need to think hard about how you motivate them and inspire them with your own vision and values, so that they develop a similar level of commitment to you. Far too many entrepreneurs struggle to get the best out of employees because of the difference in their perspectives on the business. They won't think like you about it, so you have to understand them and encourage them to become committed to it from where they are emotionally.</p> <p><strong>Good working relationships are key:</strong> There is so much comment about how much legal protection employees have, that it creates an illusion that all employees are waiting for a chance to sue their employer. The reality is that most employers and employees get on well. The simplest rule in employing people is the golden rule: treat people the way that you would want to be treated. Be fair, honest and open. You can be demanding, but only to expect people to achieve what they are capable of doing. If they aren't performing well, tell them, but be prepared to show, train or coach them to do it better.

If this is true, it has a big impact on whether or not you should recruit someone to help. It's also a good idea to create a profit and loss forecast for your business so that you can confidently show that you can afford to employ someone over the coming months or years. Alternatively you might want to look into employing someone remotely or virtually on a pay-as-you-go basis, which may offer a safer and more affordable option to get the help you need.</p> <p><em>Gregory Guilford is the director of </em><a href=\"http://www.hrsolutions-uk.com/\" title=\"\"><em>HR Solutions</em></a></p> <p><strong>Think about flexible solutions to a permanent office:</strong> Some staff will need constant support, others can work autonomously. Maybe consider a shared serviced office, as these can be quite reasonable, and you can have them on short-lease contracts too. If they work from their home you need to ensure that their office is fit for purpose, and you will most likely need to kit it out, including a laptop, broadband, phone and so on.</p> <p><em>Kevin Mole is associate professor of enterprise at </em><a href=\"http://www.wbs.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Warwick Business School</em></a></p> <p><strong>When recruiting, make sure you know what you're looking for:</strong> Are you looking for someone who can do what you know already or are you looking to hire knowledge that would complement your work and skills?

  "<figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8467/8122735770_921def8ac5.jpg\"> <img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8467/8122735770_921def8ac5.jpg\" width=\"460\" height=\"391\" /> </figure>  <p>This week's element is Hafnium, which has the atomic symbol <strong>Hf</strong> and the atomic number <strong>72</strong>. Hafnium gets its name from the Latin for Copenhagen, where it was discovered. </p> <p>Hafnium is a shiny, silver-coloured metal that is never found free in the wild. Hafnium is closely associated with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/dec/02/1\">zirconium</a> with which it shares many similarities. In fact, hafnium is so chemically similar to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/dec/02/1\">zirconium</a> that these twin elements are extremely difficult to distinguish and separate. For this reason, hafnium often contains <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/dec/02/1\">zirconium</a> impurities. </p> <p> </p> <p>In addition to having similar chemical reactions and forming the same chemical compounds, hafnium and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/dec/02/1\">zirconium</a> are also interesting because the diameters of their atoms are the same size due to the internal configuration of hafnium's additional electrons. Thus, hafnium is much denser than its twin element, so after pure samples of hafnium were finally prepared, the atomic mass of both hafnium and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/dec/02/1\">zirconium</a> had to be revised. For these reasons, hafnium was the penultimate radiostable element to be discovered. </p> <p>In addition to its close association with its twin element, hafnium is scientifically interesting because Dmitri Mendeleev predicted its existence based on his periodic table 54 years before it was actually discovered. </p> <p>Hafnium is used by the computer industry to create smaller and smaller microchips that operate more effectively whilst using less energy by regulating the flow of electricity through transistors. Hafnium is also useful to the nuclear power industry as a \"neutron sponge\" in reactor control rods. This is one characteristic that distinguishes hafnium from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/dec/02/1\">zirconium</a>: hafnium is 600 times more effective at absorbing neutrons than its elemental twin.</p> <p>Hafnium is not very interesting to biologists because it is not necessary for life. Although assumed to be biologically harmful, its toxicity is poorly characterised because pure samples are so difficult (and so expensive) to obtain. However, that said, no one has ever died of hafnium poisoning. </p> <p>Here are our favourite chemists telling us a little more about hafnium:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/egw79BA_0PA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/egw79BA_0PA?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>[<a href=\"http://youtu.be/egw79BA_0PA\">video link</a>]</p> <p>.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. </p> <p>Video journalist <a href=\"http://periodicvideos.blogspot.com/\">Brady Haran</a> is the man with the camera and the <a href=\"http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/\">University of Nottingham</a> is the place with the chemists.

Chelsea will have to secure the title without Radamel Falcao, however, with the Blues willing to stump up only \u00a340m for the Colombian striker. Falcao, who scored a hat-trick against Chelsea in the Super Cup at the start of the campaign, has a reported minimum fee release clause of \u00a348m at Atletico Madrid.</p> <p>One player who will not be leaving Stamford Bridge, yet anyway, is Florent Malouda.

When their team director, the former Brazil left-back Roberto Carlos, was quizzed on a possible move for Rooney, he said: \"Why not? He's one of the best players in the world and any team would be happy to have him in their squad. He's still a very young player.</p> <p>\"Of course I could not say when, and if, it will happen. It's not only Anzhi who can want to buy him. There are plenty of teams in Italy and Spain, all over the world, who are eager to have a player like Rooney. If the owner of Anzhi has a wish to buy somebody, he will go and do it. But we are trying to change the image of the club.

  "<p>What is it really like to be responsible for corporate responsibility in a large company? Tim Mohin's book, <a href=\"http://www.greenleaf-publishing.com/productdetail.kmod?productid=3590\" title=\"\">Changing Business from the Inside Out: A Treehugger's guide to working in Corporations</a>, answers this question very well indeed.</p> <p>Addressed in the main to the aspiring CSR manager, it tells the story of how you will be \"responsible for a wide range of corporate behaviours and programs for which you have almost no control.\"</p> <p>If that doesn't put you off, then you will find that the majority of the book provides wise advice on how to negotiate the corporate whirlpools of business cases, committees and presentations and do the best you can for CSR. Assuming it is possible to reconcile making money and a passion for the state of the world, this book provides a manual for how to steer the corporate supertanker away from the rocks of unsustainability. It covers a range of issues, including reporting, supply chains and the environment. And it vividly conveys the rich experience that Mohin undoubtedly has.</p> <p>The guiding premise is that all this is better done from within. However important campaigning NGOs might be, for Mohin they pale in comparison to, say, leveraging a multinational corporation's buying power to improve conditions in its supply chain.</p> <p>But is that premise right? Mohin divides those companies active in CSR into two: those who have had an epiphany (they just get it) and the 2x4's (where a 2x4 is a piece of wood). The \"2x4 company\" has been whacked over the head, suffering a reputation crash, perhaps. Yet someone must be on the other end of each of those 2x4's; for every whack, there is an NGO or a journalist wielding the stick that has brought the issue to the attention of the world.</p> <p>Few companies start to think about their supply chain without attention from civil society. It is a moot point whether the NGO or the company in the end \"does more good\" or is more important. But I do recall a CSR manager in an oil company telling me that what he most needed was another NGO campaign to frighten his board \u2013 then he could really get things done. In the end both manager and campaigner are each absolutely necessary.</p> <p>Just as the efforts of a CSR manager need to be put in the context of civil society, the measures of CSR success \u2013 awards, peer comparisons and performance trends \u2013 need to be put in the context of actual sustainability. The question must always be asked: what if everyone did this (say produce 80% fewer tonnes of CO2e)? Would we then have a sustainable world? And would it make a difference if all companies gained the latest CSR award? Or are we in that wonderland where all that matters is that everyone must have a prize?</p> <p>Likewise, the company as a whole needs to be put in the context of its stakeholders. Of course stakeholders of every stripe figure prominently throughout the book. But the emphasis within CSR is on what your stakeholders can do for you: \"At its essence, stakeholder engagement is really about getting input on your program goals, progress and plans,\" Mohin writes.</p> <p>Again in Mohin's approach to materiality, a balance is to be struck between the importance of an issue to 'stakeholders' and the importance to the company. Yet 'the company' here really means a few powerful stakeholders, particularly shareholders and senior management. In this classic CSR materiality analysis 'the company' is given equal weight to all other stakeholders put together. Perhaps you should ask not what your stakeholder can do for you, but what you can do for your stakeholders.</p> <p>So my main criticism of this book is not so much about the extent to which it provides valid advice for those engaged with CSR \u2013 it does \u2013 but more about the nature and effectiveness of CSR itself, which this book does not question. Can CSR ever be enough? That of course depends on how you define it. But Mohin seems to confine CSR to an exercise in navigational tactics: doing the best you can within the confines of a business case.</p> <p>CSR is not in the game of setting fundamental direction or strategy. Yet it is from questioning the viability of business models and strategy that real change derives.

The ceasefire has no monitoring mechanism. After a few days (or even a few hours) of rest, fighters on both sides may feel like going at it again. The regime is not going to want peaceful demonstrations showing the strength of the rebellion or rearming of the Free Syrian Army. The armed rebels are not going to want the regime to use the ceasefire to regain its balance and reset its strategy, which has accomplished little beyond destruction so far.</p> <p>Brahimi and his team will need enormous patience and commitment.

Our colleague Mona Mahmood has been talking via Skype with Aula Sulaiman, a resident in the Nile Street district of the city (on the southern edge of Khalidiyeh district) which is under Syrian army control.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is no sign of Eid in my neighbourhood. Some people were trying to do shopping yesterday, but it was not like the day before Eid at all.</p> <p>We didn't do the special cake we do every Eid and didn't even buy the sweets we used to buy every Eid to offer to our guests. We are in a big crisis and there is no space for such things \u2013 we hardly can be happy even if it is Eid.</p> <p>Eid prayers today had very few people and mosques near areas under shelling did not open at all today.</p> <p>We were able to slaughter a sheep today, and some other people did, though people are very short of money. We intend to take the meat to refugees in schools and gardens and also to liberated districts as butchers' shops are closed there. Getting a sheep in Aleppo is not easy these days .. and the price is $300-$500.</p> <p>The main market, Al-Madina market is in old Aleppo near the castle. It is where people used to do all their shopping as it has moderate prices. Now, no one can access it as half of it is occupied by the FSA and the the other half by the Syrian army and snipers are on top of the buildings.</p> <p>Yesterday, we had heavy rain in Aleppo and as the city has been neglected for a long time without municipality services water swamped the roads. Shops and street vendors lost everything as the water covered their goods.</p> <p>The FSA fighters were able to access new districts in Aleppo yesterday \u2013 Ashrafiyeh, al-Rahman mosque and al-Sabeel. The FSA are surrounding the Criminal Security now but the Syrian army have brought tanks to Ashrafiyeh district today. The tanks did not fire any shells.</p> <p>If the tanks do open fire there, it will be a disaster as Ashrafiyeh is very populated and the people would have to move out.</p> <p>There is a barracks Syrian army in the district where I live. The FSA are controlling part of it and trying to get control of the other two parts but till now they could not. This barracks has anti-aircraft missiles. If the FSA can liberate this barracks, they can liberate our district too.</p> <p>After the FSA attack yesterday, we expected a retaliation by the Syrian army \u2013 specially by planes \u2013 but thank God it did not happen. Some of the people here are talking about Jabhat al-Nusra being able to get anti-aircraft missiles from abroad, which stops the Syrian army shelling the the city with planes. I have to say that the planes have not shelled Aleppo for three days now.</p> <p>There is an artillery in al-Zahra district. It has been shooting a site near Ashrafiyeh since this morning. I have heard more than six shells so far.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-508aa4ac95cb4ec5a031ba1d\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-26T14:56:44.256Z\">3.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Children injured in Damascus bomb</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Several children were injured in the Damascus car bomb according to an activist in the city.</p> <p>A playground was hit, according to Susan Ahmad, spokeswoman for the Revolutionary Command Council of Damascus.

And there are reports, as you know, of serious fighting in Aleppo and Idlib, et cetera.</p> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18JTkk8JbeU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/18JTkk8JbeU?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-508a3d1195cb4897f0db538f\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-26T07:34:43.473Z\">8.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Welcome to Middle East Live on the first day of an unmonitored ceasefire in Syria to mark the Eid al-Adha holiday.</p> <p>Here's a roundup of the latest developments:</p> <h2>Syria</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20091598\"><strong>The four-day ceasefire started at dawn on Friday, but the army warned it would retaliate against rebel attacks, the BBC reports.</strong></a> The truce&#xa0;was proposed by UN and Arab League envoy Lakhdar Brahimi in the face of scepticism from opposition activists and rebels. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/oct/25/syria-eid-al-adha-ceasefire-video\">Syrian state TV announced the army's intention to suspend military operations on Thursday night.</a></p> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/26/us-syria-crisis-clashes-idUSBRE89P07N20121026\">The truce was broken early in southern Deraa province when three people were wounded by gunfire from security forces dispersing protesters, Reuters reports citing the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. </a></strong>The three people were wounded as they left a mosque in Inkhil, it said.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43378&amp;Cr=syria&amp;Cr1=#.UIoko3EaC3U\"><strong>UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon welcomed the ceasefire agreement and urged both sides to adhere to it, his chief spokesman said.</strong></a> Martin Nesirky told a news conference: \"We all understand that there is a lack of trust between parties, and therefore we all understand that we cannot be sure yet what will transpire, but the hope is that guns will fall silent for the people of Syria, so that they have peace and quiet during this holy holiday.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/25/syria-rebels-advance-aleppo\"><strong>After more than two months of near stalemate, rebel groups have advanced into three government-held areas of central Aleppo, ahead of the ceasefire.</strong></a> It&#xa0;was the first time that territory has changed hands since mid-August with rebel&#xa0;gains in two Christian areas of Aleppo as well as a Kurdish enclave.&#xa0;A rebel fighter in Aleppo, Abu Yousef, said: \"Brigades of the FSA were able to progress from al-Ashrafiyeh district.

  "<p>For as long as I can remember, councils have been considered a helping hand of last resort, providing safe secure homes at an affordable price and emergency accommodation for those who find themselves homeless. It has become part of the national mindset that if things get really bad you can always go \"down the council\" and they'll sort you out.</p> <p>In fact, things changed some time ago. The Housing Act 1996 allowed local authorities to discharge their duty to the homeless by offering accommodation in the private rental sector, as well as a council or housing association property.</p> <p>On 17 October 2012, any notions of a safety net were finally blown away by the announcement that in November the \"homelessness suitability of accommodation (England) order\" will come into force.</p> <p>All of us working in housing have known this was coming for over a year, but the public knows little of this truly seismic shift. You can <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/2601/pdfs/uksi_20122601_en.pdf\" title=\"\">read through the statutory instrument</a> itself, but I will explain in detail what will happen to the public when they walk through the doors of a local homelessness unit after 9 November.</p> <p>Currently, when a homeless application is made the council can make an offer to help set the applicant up with a private letting, sometimes assisting with the deposit or rent in advance. However the applicant can turn it down, saying they are prepared to sit in temporary accommodation until a council or housing association property becomes available. That is their right, but from November that right will be lost.</p> <p>In future, when a person makes an approach and is met by a homelessness prevention officer, they are likely to explain there is no need to go through a full homelessness assessment because the council has a partner landlord who owns an available property, and will offer it as a 12-month assured shorthold tenancy. The prevention team could also advise the applicant that, if they prefer, they could find their own private sector accommodation and the homelessness unit could help with deposit or other financial assistance. This way they would have more choice and control over where they end up.</p> <p>If the applicant refuses this, and want instead to be fully assessed to determine whether the council owes them a greater duty of care, then the unit will have to carry out what is called a \"part VII assessment\". Five tests must be passed; the applicant must be:</p> <p>\u2022 Eligible for assistance</p> <p>\u2022 Legally homeless (there are several definitions of homelessness, but they don't have to be sleeping on the street)</p> <p>\u2022 In priority need, for example with dependent children, with physical or mental health problems or expecting a child</p> <p>\u2022 Not made homeless intentionally, through a failure to pay rent or mortgage (as well as other factors)</p> <p>\u2022 Possess a local connection with the council, usually a former resident themselves or with close family who are residents</p> <p>What is important to note is that if the applicant fails just one of the tests, which are carried out in the sequence above, then their claim for support will fail and they will generally be expected to make their own arrangements. If they get through the five tests they will be owed the full housing duty of care, which at the moment is met by either the offer of a private letting or a choice to wait in temporary accommodation until a social letting comes up.</p> <p>But from next month, when an applicant passes all five tests and the full housing duty is owed, the council will once again offer the same private property they were offered when they first came through the door.</p> <p>So the homeless household has a certain amount of choice and control if they accept the homelessness prevention offer. Yet if they choose to go through the full assessment route, they run the risk of failing a test and getting no housing assistance at all. And if they pass the five tests they will probably be offered the very same property.</p> <p>It is a profound and astonishing change in policy. The notion that homelessness applications can be used as a route to social housing will be completely gone by the end of next month.</p> <p>I never cease to be astonished at how resilient the idea is that if you were born and brought up in an area you will get a council house at some point. I can still remember when that was the case, but it has been at least 15 years since policy and popular opinion were married and yet people still hold that urban myth. I wonder how long it will take for the penny to drop about the new way of working?</p> <p>While everyone is (quite rightly) up in arms about welfare reform and the introduction of universal credit, another massive social upheaval is taking place and going unnoticed.</p> <p>Hard times indeed, and there is a chill wind blowing. People working in frontline housing services will feel its bite.</p> <p><em>Ben Reeve-Lewis is a tenancy relations officer for a local authority in London</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/housing/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for news, views and the latest jobs direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>Spirituality has always been associated with the quest for health. Camberwell in south London, I recently learned, derives its name from a healing well frequented by those who were \"cambered\", or physically disabled. But it is only a scientific age that would seek to distil causal links between a spiritual practice and its physical effects, and perhaps also be concerned to exorcise any metaphysical excess.</p> <p>The discussion of the benefits of practices traditionally associated with religions is firmly on the secular agenda. The new edition of the <a href=\"http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780195335958.do#.UIZzC7T3AnU\" title=\"\">Handbook of Religion and Health</a> lists more than 3,000 published studies. Research on forgiveness and gratitude alone has increased by an order of magnitude since the turn of the millennium.</p> <p>Robert Emmons, professor of psychology at University of California, Davis, has gathered evidence to show that gratitude has psychological benefits, sustains physical wellbeing and feeds human relationships. He also believes there is an important spiritual side to the virtue, as gratitude cultivates a sense of fulfilment in life by nurturing the sense of dependency on others and God.</p> <p>Or consider forgiveness. A significant cultural reassessment of this virtue seems under way: it is now taken less as a sign of weakness and more of inner strength. \"Genuine forgiveness is important in transforming relations, just as confession, apology and repentance are. Forgiveness is connected to other virtues, like empathy and justice,\" adds Charlotte vanOyen-Witvliet, professor of psychology at Hope College, Michigan. She is also keen to stress that forgiveness is not about forgetting the damage of the offence, but is interested in the wellbeing of the offender.</p> <p>Researchers emphasise that the links between spirituality and wellbeing need much further study. \"Do we really know what it is about what sort of religion, spirituality or belief that enhances health?\" asks Stephen Post, author of <a href=\"http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470887818.html\" title=\"\">The Hidden Gifts of Helping</a> and moderator of a recent conference that addressed these issues, <a href=\"http://www.acelebrationofspirit.org/events/human-spirit/\" title=\"\">Spiritual Progress and Human Flourishing</a>. His answer is no, but \"progress is being made\".</p> <p>Teaching spirituality and health is also being promoted. In August, Oxford University Press published a textbook for public health professionals, <a href=\"http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199571390.do#.UGXCOEL3AnU\" title=\"\">The Oxford Textbook of Spirituality in Healthcare</a>. Christina Puchalski of the <a href=\"http://www.gwish.org\" title=\"\">George Washington Institute for Spirituality and Health</a>, and one of the book's editors, argues that healthcare improvements have been driven by technology. \"What is unfortunately missing is a relationship-centred compassionate approach,\" she argues, \"and that's the foundation of spirituality in healthcare.\"</p> <p>And the burgeoning interest raises theological questions too. Another book, published in September by the Templeton Press, asks whether healthcare risks turning faith into a medical commodity. <a href=\"http://templetonpress.org/book/healing-all-their-flesh\" title=\"\">Healing To All Their Flesh: Jewish and Christian Perspectives on Spirituality, Theology, and Health</a>, worries that, while research on religion and health is now acceptable, it may be distorting. As Jeff Levin, one of the book's editors, writes in the prologue: \"Religion is just more grist for the mill of structural-equation models, survival analyses, logistic regressions and the like.\"</p> <p>In other words, there is a lack of theoretical and theological reflection in the field and that matters for two reasons. One is scientific. Levin continues: \"A medical researcher would never conduct a study of the health impact of, say, environmental toxins or nutritional status or social support without first consulting an environmental toxicologist or a nutritionist or a sociologist who could expertly identify what questions to ask, what hypotheses to frame, and, once data were collected, how to analyse the data and then how to interpret findings. Yet, in studies of religion and health, this is done all the time; it is probably the norm. This is foolish, irresponsible and self-defeating.\"</p> <p>Second, it matters at a human level. Could there be something cruel in \"prescribing\" a spiritual practice as if it were a pill because of the implications for the patient when the supposed \"remedy\" fails to work? What is not being asked is what religious traditions actually teach about the link between faith and health \u2013 a question that might then lead to others, like how the status of the spirit matters for the functioning of the body?</p> <p>After all, it seems likely that the wellbeing gained from religious practices would be indirect. The believer who says grace at the start of a meal does not do so to be happy but to thank God. Alternatively, and reflecting on Julian Baggini's interesting article on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/oct/22/navratri-lessons-fasting-atheists\" title=\"\">atheists fasting</a>, celebrating a newfound control of the appetites could confuse the means with the end: spiritually speaking, fasting is about expanding an individual's range of interests so that they can move beyond material concerns.</p> <p>Spirituality and health are both great goods. But confusing the two brings risks. It might load individuals already anxious about their lifestyles with yet more burdens. And it could stymie the spiritual transformation of the person.</p>",
  "<p>I live in Exeter, where I train mental health professionals at the university in postgraduate programmes. Two days a week I work in London, seeing clients in psychotherapy and also doing consultancy work advising organisations.</p> <p>I get up at about 6.30am, do my short exercise regime, have breakfast, then either leg it down a steep hill to the station to make the London train, or walk up another winding hill to the university. I have always walked, but it was only after my diagnosis of breast cancer in 1995 that I began to take the idea of regular exercise seriously.</p> <p>If I'm in London I see clients all morning. I work in a joint practice and try to grab moments to catch up with colleagues. Because I've written and lectured about breast cancer, particularly about its effects on families, I often get referrals from women who have, or have had breast cancer themselves, or from family members of people with breast cancer.</p> <p>If I'm in Exeter, on Thursday mornings I work with a different group of clinicians, mostly family therapists, at the university. As it is a training clinic, we supervise upcoming clinical psychologists and family therapists in working with couples.</p> <p>On other days I might be teaching. If there isn't a lecture scheduled I will be writing up or developing research and training projects. My work on breast cancer in families was one example of this; currently I am working on developing programmes around best management of conflict and early prevention of relationship decline within couples.</p> <p>If I'm in London I will have made myself a lunch from home or else grabbed a salad en route. I eat between clinical appointments \u2013 I close the door, don't answer emails, and do the crossword, tuning out the world. It's bliss!</p> <p>I am a psychologist who has always specialised in families and couples clinically and also as a researcher and broadcaster. Recently I have been working with Avon to create the <a href=\"http://www.avon.uk.com/PRSuite/20120802_bcam_promise.page#.UIpzV79y9E4\">Avon Breast Promise Report</a>.</p> <p>The report explores why, despite all the information available, woman are still not regularly checking their breasts and, based on the psychology behind what will motivate a change in this behaviour, advises as to how to get into the habit.</p> <p>I was part of a family that experienced breast cancer over a long period, as it struck my mother and her sisters, each at the centre of their families, as young mothers, in a time when there was both little knowledge and little discussion of it.</p> <p>I came from a strong family and my parents had a devoted marriage, but I experienced the toll breast cancer took on their relationship and their children.</p> <p>My own mother ended up surviving until my early adulthood. She made me very aware of how to check myself from an early age. Significantly, the difference between my own experience, both of my mother's illness in contrast to her sisters' and my own, was early diagnosis and treatment. This is the main reason I was motivated to work on the report.</p> <p>I leave my clinical practice on Mondays at 7pm or 7:30pm, staying over in London, and on Tuesdays I leave earlier taking a train at 6pm and getting home at 8:30pm. If I'm in Exeter I stop at 7pm.</p> <p>As for unwinding, the rituals of it give a satisfying end to the shape of my day. If I miss them I feel frazzled. When I get home I listen to the radio and make dinner. When my husband gets home we eat, have a glass of wine and then watch an episode of a box-set we've chosen, and then it's time for bed.</p> <p>I always read myself to sleep.

  "<p>For most of human history, mind-altering substances have been regarded as a source of innocent pleasure, or perhaps something better than pleasure: religious rapture, aesthetic insight, or rushes of courage or love. But they can do obvious harm as well: occasional adventures may make you clumsy, reckless, deluded or obtuse, and if they coalesce into steady habits you could end up as an outcast or a helpless invalid.</p> <p>As long as such effects were confined to upper-class adults like Samuel Taylor Coleridge, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/18/confessions-of-an-opium-eater\" title=\"\">Thomas de Quincey</a> or <a href=\"http://century.theguardian.com/1910-1919/Story/0,,126410,00.html\" title=\"\">Florence Nightingale</a>, they could be treated as individual misfortunes; but when they were observed among the productive classes and their children, moral indifference was hard to sustain. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/picture/2012/sep/12/william-hogarth-gin-lane\" title=\"\">gin craze</a> in 18th-century London provoked a handful of panicky government reactions, and a century later the British state embarked on systematic regulation of the opiates contained in popular patent medicines. But specific legislation against so-called narcotic drugs did not start till the first world war, when the government \u2013 worried about public order, national security and military discipline \u2013 imposed restrictions on pub opening hours, and made unauthorised possession of cocaine and opium a criminal offence.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/cannabis\" title=\"\">Cannabis</a> was added to the list of forbidden substances shortly afterwards, but it always carried an aura that set it apart. It was held to be relatively harmless \u2013 more like alcohol and tobacco than opium or cocaine \u2013 and in any case, it was associated with bohemian intellectuals in studios and jazz clubs rather than scowling proletarians in dens of vice and iniquity. If there were steep increases in cannabis consumption after the second world war, they were concentrated among the kind of people who were considered too genteel to be of any interest to the police.</p> <p>What happened next is the subject of the latest polemic by the conservative columnist Peter Hitchens. The story he tells, though it has some difficulty emerging from his tangled exposition, is meant to shock and appal. In the beginning there were the Beatles, scattering sinister references to drugs in their sweet-sounding songs. Then there were the celebrity drug-busts: Donovan and his naked girlfriend in 1966, followed by Mick Jagger and his rolling friends. To Hitchens's consternation, these criminals managed to escape the obloquy they deserved. In the first place, there were gaggles of teenage fans \"voiding their bladders\", as he puts it, in uncontrollable excitement. Then there was the louche coterie of lascivious libertarians who placed an advertisement in the Times in 1967, calling for complete decriminalisation of cannabis. And finally there was utter calamity in the form of the cultural revolution of 1968.</p> <p>Hitchens is not the kind of conservative who rhapsodises about the persistence of tradition in British life. As far as he is concerned, the institutions that once made Britain great \u2013 from parliament to the ancient seats of learning, from monarchy and the common law to the Church of England \u2013 have all been hollowed out and subverted by cynical <em>soixante-huitards</em>.</p> <p>He traces the damage to what he calls the \"central committee of the British cultural revolution\", most of whose members, he claims, were signatories of the petition in the Times: David Hockney, Graham Greene, Jonathan Aitken, Alasdair MacIntyre, Kenneth Tynan, Francis Crick and David Dimbleby, among others. If these names strike you as rather safe, that only demonstrates the triumph of their silky stratagems. With the help of other university-educated subversives \u2013 from Tony Crosland, Harold Wilson and Roy Jenkins on the left to Reginald Maudling, William Rees-Mogg and Michael Portillo on the right \u2013 they worked tirelessly to turn Britain into a country with no moral aspirations apart from sex, drugs and rock'n'roll. They recruited a number of luckless ladies as well, notably Diana Runciman (\"divorced\"), Barbara Wootton (\"battleaxe\") and Joan Bakewell (\"adulteress\").</p> <p>If you want their monument, you need only open your eyes to observe a Britain where parents are no longer allowed to be parents, where teachers will not teach, and where the police are more interested in political correctness than the prosecution of crime. Divorce, you will find, has become \"easier than ending a car-leasing agreement\", and restrictions on the sale and use of alcohol have been abolished. In due course, you will become aware of the most terrible scandal of all: that the law against cannabis and other stupefying narcotics is now \"so feebly enforced that it might as well not exist\".</p> <p>If you still have difficulty recognising Hitchens's version of contemporary Britain, that only confirms the power of the Big Lie. Ever since 1968, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/08/leader-drugs-legalisation-reform-marijuana\" title=\"\">our unelected rulers have given an impression of fighting a war against drugs</a>, while surreptitiously dismantling our last defences against them. Without anyone realising what they were up to, they have wiped out the old ethic of hard work and honest trade, and turned us into a nation of pot-smokers.</p> <p>Hitchens is a virtuoso of the magniloquent non-sequitur. He devotes many pages to denouncing research into the risks associated with different drugs (\"meaningless\", he calls it), and spends just as many stringing together anecdotes to suggest that cannabis is the most harmful drug of all. He notes that American attempts to prohibit alcohol in the 1920s were a self-defeating disaster, but goes on to call for exactly the same no-tolerance approach to cannabis in Britain now. And when he offers a bemused account of the government's success in reducing the use of tobacco in Britain, he manages to overlook the obvious inference: that if cannabis is as dangerous as he supposes, then it ought to be explicitly decriminalised and subjected to the same controls as tobacco.</p> <p>I have never been very impressed by the idea that human nature changed in 1968. And Hitchens's unhinged affirmation that, since that date, young people have considered themselves entitled to everything they want without any effort or study is not going to make me change my mind. In a period of glorious achievement in classical music and theatre, I find it hard to believe \"high culture, effort, self-discipline and patience\" have lost out entirely to \"young men and women who brawl and spew in the midnight streets of our great cities\".</p> <p>I am surprised, however, to find that someone who claims to respect culture and discipline chooses to mock Reginald Maudling as a \"Hegel enthusiast\", as if habitual Hegel-reading were a wretched self-indulgence rather than an arduous long-term cultural investment. And I am astonished that he can base an entire book on a few cuttings from the Evening Standard, the Daily Mail and the News of the World.</p> <p>But it occurs to me that I may always have been wrong about 1968. Perhaps it really did change the world \u2013 not by turning us all into junkies, but by unleashing the virulent strain of hysterical moralising that Hitchens appears to be suffering from. Like many other members of his generation \u2013 fogeys of the left as well as the right \u2013 he seems to be addicted to a form of self-righteousness so intense that it amounts to moral racism. His own instincts strike him as so self-evident that anyone who does not share them has to be dismissed with total contempt. If we are indeed surrounded by cultural ruin, then Hitchens is a fine specimen of it: one of those manic preachers who have been shouting so long that they can no longer hear any voice apart from their own.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan R\u00e9e's <em>I See a Voice</em> is published by Flamingo.</p>",

In life, over a period spanning decades, the Leeds-born and bred celebrity is now accused of committing a massive con-exercise on the public.</p> <p>Support for numerous charities and good causes, including the Leeds General Infirmary in his home city, led many to consider him eccentric, but with a good heart. Such was the respect people had for him that he was given what amounted to a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/nov/08/jimmy-savile-coffin-public-display\">lying in state </a>at the Queen's Hotel in Leeds, with 5,000 mourners passing his coffin before his burial on a Scarborough hilltop.</p> <p>A year on, that legacy has turned into one of trauma and destruction. As police investigate the sickening possibility that he led a double life, involved in repeated child abuse, Scotland Yard has said that<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/oct/25/jimmy-savile-sexual-assault-complaints-alive\"> it is investigating</a> around 300 potential cases. Across the country, men and women have come forward to tell heart-wrenching stories of times when on public property, including that of the BBC and the National Health Service, Savile allegedly abused some of the most vulnerable children in society in the knowledge that that same society was unlikely to believe their word against his. </p> <p>At the time of his death, the <em>Guardian</em>'s <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/oct/29/sir-jimmy-savile\">obituary noted:</a></p> <blockquote> <p>Many considered that there was something strange about Savile. His enthusiasm for spending quite so much time in the hospital environment had a touch of the macabre about it.</p> </blockquote> <p>This comment goes to the heart of the case: that while rumour and speculation existed, Savile had done enough to ensure that those who had their concerns did not feel they had sufficient evidence to make public accusations of the kind that, with hindsight, they should have made. </p> <p>Coupled with the scarring of lives, the affair risks a loss of public trust in that cherished institution, the BBC. So loved that we know it as Auntie, it now faces questions over the future of its new director general, George Entwistle, and the chair of the BBC Trust, Lord Patten. The issue has spread to the <em>New York Times</em> and <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/ny-times-public-editor-calls-incoming-ceo-thompson-060009630--finance.html\">the role of Mark Thompson</a>, appointed as the paper's chief executive just last month, who was the BBC's director general at the time of the issue of whether Newsnight should or should not have televised its investigation into Savile. </p> <p>The Culture Secretary, Maria Miller, has <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com/uk/article/64170/letter_from_culture_secretary_maria_miller_to_bbc_trust_chair_lord_patten.html\">raised \"real concerns\" </a>about the loss of \"public trust and confidence in the BBC\" and this leads to the wider point. The Corporation is not the first public institution in current and recent times to lose the confidence of the public that it is there to serve. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2012-10-22a.719.0&amp;s=speaker:11814\">debate over Hillsborough</a> in the House of Commons on Monday reminded many of the difficult questions being asked of senior serving police officers, leading to<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/24/norman-bettison-resigns-hillsborough-west-yorkshire\"> the resignation this week </a>of Sir Norman Bettison as chief constable of West Yorkshire. The Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, found himself apologising in the same debate for the errors identified in the Hillsborough report in the way that another cherished institution, the National Health Service, responded to the disaster.</p> <p>Add to that the sapping of confidence in the banking system following a meltdown which had its roots in the 1980s culture of making a fast buck; an MPs' expenses scandal which developed over many years as politicians of all parties were encouraged to increase their expenses so that their wages could be kept down to avoid public opprobrium; and the loss of a substantial amount of public trust and confidence in the press, as the Leveson Inquiry has unearthed all sorts of skeletons in closets. Is the sum of these a perfect storm?</p> <p>Our politicians, elected to govern; our media, called upon to tell truth to power; our police, in place uphold the law; and our banks, in which many had trusted to protect their savings, have one by one found themselves undermined by events many years in the making.</p> <p>As a child born in the mid-1980s I have no recollection of much of those origins; but what does seem increasingly clear is that there was a culture, something within a number of our public services, that seemed to accept police colluding to denigrate fans crushed to death at a football match; to ignore the likely consequences of celebrities using their sex appeal with children; and to think that getting stinking rich by risking everything was OK. </p> <p>Once we truly get to the heart of both Hillsborough and Savile, and justice in those individual cases is done, a much bigger argument therefore awaits us. What was it with society then? How could so many of our public and financial institutions have failed in the way that they did? And most importantly, have we changed sufficiently to make it impossible for such events to occur again?</p> <p>As a nation and as a society we must learn the lessons so that those fundamental pillars of democracy \u2013 Parliament, the press, the police and financial institutions - can once again be held in the esteem that should be theirs. </p> <p><em><em><strong>Ed Jacobs</strong> is a political consultant at the&#xa0;Leeds based&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.publicaffairsco.com/\">Public Affairs Company</a>&#xa0;and devolution correspondent for the centre-left political and policy blog,&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.leftfootforward.org/\">Left Foot Forward</a>. </em></em></p>",
  "<p>A quick burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team</p> <h2><a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/5953866/microsoft-surface-rt-review-this-is-technological-heartbreak\">Microsoft Surface RT Review: this Is technological heartbreak &gt;&gt; Gizmodo</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>Should you buy it?</p> <p> No. The Surface, with an obligatory Touch Cover, is $600. That's a lot of money. Especially given that it's no laptop replacement, no matter how it looks or what Microsoft says. It's a tablet-plus, priced right alongside the iPad and in most ways inferior.</p> </blockquote> <p> A long and considered review, with plenty that it likes about the Surface. But somewhat more it doesn't.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.citeworld.com/tablets/20990/microsofts-approach-tablet-market-wrong\">Microsoft is taking the wrong approach to tablets &gt;&gt; CITEworld</a></h2> <p>Ron Miller: </p> <blockquote> <p>Tablet manufacturers have been trying to give us keyboards for our tablets for a while now, and they haven't stuck. I saw a device from Asus at CeBIT in March, 2011 that combined a tablet with a little slide out keyboard. Sound familiar? Why didn't they fly off the shelves? You could argue it's because the wrong company produced them, or because the early version of Android it was based on did not work well for tablets, but I think it's more fundamental than that. The touch-screen tablet has changed the way we interact with devices. People want software that takes advantage of that - and doesn't force us to use it like a laptop.</p> </blockquote> <p> On the \"nobody knows anything\" hypothesis, this means the Surface is a runaway hit.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/10/surmounting-the-insurmountable-wikipedia-is-nearing-completion-in-a-sense/264111/\">Surmounting the Insurmountable: Wikipedia Is nearing completion, in a sense &gt;&gt; The Atlantic</a></h2> <p>Interesting question from Rebecca Rosen: </p> <blockquote> <p>what if the decline in engagement has little to do with culture or the design of the site? What if, instead, it's that there's just less for new Wikipedians to do?</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-25/apple-s-online-radio-service-to-challenge-pandora-in-2013.html\">Apple's online radio service to challenge Pandora in 2013 &gt;&gt; Bloomberg</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>Apple Inc. (AAPL) and major music labels have intensified negotiations to start an advertising-supported internet radio service by early next year, according to people with knowledge of the talks.</p> <p> Talks are centered in part around how to share ad revenue and a deal could be reached by mid-November, with Apple starting a service within the first three months of 2013, said the people, who asked not to be named because discussions are still in progress. Shares of Internet-radio leader Pandora Media plunged.</p> </blockquote> <p> Samsung is interested in this space too.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.fosspatents.com/2012/10/preliminary-itc-ruling-finds-samsung-in.html\">Preliminary ITC ruling finds Samsung in infringement of four Apple patents &gt;&gt; FOSS Patents</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>Previous ITC decisions either cleared Android devices of violation of the asserted patents (Apple's three-patent complaint against Motorola) or identified a violation with respect to only one or two patents at a time. But on Wednesday, Administrative Law Judge Thomas B. Pender issued a <a href=\"http://usitc.gov/press_room/documents/337_796_ID.pdf\">preliminary ruling</a> in Apple's favor against Samsung over four patents: one design patent, one hardware patent, and two multitouch software patents...</p> <p> The total number of valid Apple and Microsoft patents that Android-based devices have been held by courts around the world and the ITC to infringe has now increased to 20.</p> </blockquote> <p> The ITC ruling is preliminary and can be appealed, and/or worked around. Still means hassle for Samsung. The total of patents against Android doesn't seem to have been fixed by buying Motorola at all.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Google-Drive-opens-backdoor-to-Google-accounts-1735069.html\">Google Drive opens backdoor to Google accounts &gt;&gt; The H Security</a></h2> <p>In reference to the desktop clients on Windows and Mac: </p> <blockquote> <p>The sync tool includes a \"Visit Google Drive on the web\" link which opens Drive's web interface in the default browser and automatically logs the user in. Somewhat problematic is the fact that this session can then be used to switch to other Google services such as GMail and Google Calendar.</p> <p> Even if the user explicitly logs out of the Google sites by clicking the \"Sign out\" link, the Drive client will open a new session without requiring a password. The desktop clients request login credentials only once, when they are first installed and launched.</p> </blockquote> <p> This routes around even Google's two-factor authentication. But you already have a timeout lock on your screen, right?</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/show/6385/microsoft-surface-review\">Microsoft Surface Review &gt;&gt; Anandtech</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>After using Microsoft's Surface for the past week I can say that I honestly get it. This isn't an iPad competitor, nor is it an Android tablet competitor. It truly is something different. A unique perspective, not necessarily the right one, but a different one that will definitely resonate well with some (not all) users. After the past week I also understand Panos Panay's desire for secrecy. From a distance, without using one, Surface is easy to judge. It's a Windows tablet that doesn't run most Windows applications, that doesn't have most of the same new mobile apps that iOS and Android have, and it's not priced aggressively enough to make those facts disappear. After living with Surface however, I understand the appeal. It's worth a discussion, perhaps even consideration as it does some things better than any tablet on the market, and it does others worse.</p> </blockquote> <p> Brew that coffee: you've got 12 pages to go through. </p> <h2><a href=\"http://pandodaily.com/2012/10/24/travis-shrugged/\">Travis Shrugged: The creepy, dangerous ideology behind Silicon Valley's Cult of Disruption &gt;&gt; PandoDaily</a></h2> <p>Paul Carr: </p> <blockquote> <p>Laws don't exist merely to frustrate the business ambitions of coastal hipsters: They also exist to protect the more vulnerable members of society. Back home in London (where such statistics are available), 11 women a month are attacked in unlicensed cabs, and unlicensed drivers are responsible for a horrifying 80 percent of all stranger rapes. If Uber doesn't have to follow licensing laws, then neither does any Tom, Dick, or Harry who chooses to paint the word \"TAXI\" on the side of his car, and start offering rides via the Internet. A disruptive CEO will shrug (and there's a foreshadowing word) and insist that it's not his fault that such criminals exist. \"Just because there are people who want to rape, murder, or rob you shouldn't prevent me from making another million dollars,\" he'll argue.</p> <p> Remarkably, a large part of the Internet community -- by which I <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/11/a-community-of-dunces/\">mean</a> that tiny number of social media fanatics who spend their days on Twitter, looking for the next cause to rally behind or the next bad guy to boycott -- will agree with him.</p> </blockquote> <p> (Thanks @jseths on Twitter for the link.)</p> <p>You can follow <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:guardiantech\">Guardian Technology's linkbucket on Pinboard</a>.

  "<p>Chinese authorities have blocked the Chinese website of the New York Times and most access to the main website after it revealed that the extended family of premier <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/business/global/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html \">Wen Jiabao has controlled assets worth at least $2.7bn</a> (\u00a31.67bn). </p> <p>Several of Wen's close relatives have become extremely wealthy since his ascent to the top leadership, the news organisation said. But in many cases their holdings were obscured by layers of partnerships and investment vehicles involving friends, colleagues or business partners.</p> <p>A single investment held on paper by Wen's 90-year-old mother Yang Zhiyun - a retired schoolteacher - was worth $120m five years ago, the Times said. It added it was unclear if Yang was aware of the holdings in her name.</p> <p>The report is embarrassing not only for Wen himself - who comes from a modest background and is widely seen as the sympathetic, populist face of the government - but for the party. It is the latest in a string of unwelcome revelations about the vast wealth amassed by those around senior leaders.</p> <p>Authorities blocked the Bloomberg website earlier this year after it exposed the multi-million dollar <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/29/china-bloomberg-xi-jinping \">assets held by the extended family of Xi Jinping</a>, heir-apparent to the presidency. The news agency has also reported that relatives of disgraced politician Bo Xilai accumulated at least $136m in assets.</p> <p>Many people - particularly among the elite - had been aware of rumours about relatives of Wen. But the full detail of the report and the scale of their assets is striking. The timing is also sensitive, given that the once-a-decade leadership transition is weeks away. </p> <p>But the blocking of the websites and censorship on Chinese microblogs means that many may remain unaware of the Times account.</p> <p>Several users commented on the report on the Sina Weibo service, but the remarks were quickly deleted. A BBC news report was blacked out in Beijing as it referred to the article.</p> <p>Wen has repeatedly stressed the need to curb corruption, urging leaders to ensure their families and associates do not abuse government influence, and pushed for officials to disclose the assets of their immediate families. </p> <p>Such declarations are not made public and the Times said four-fifths of the assets they found were held by relatives such as his mother, younger brother and various in-laws - none of whom would be covered by the party rules.</p> <p>A former government colleague of Wen's, who spoke anonymously, told the Times: \"In the senior leadership, there's no family that doesn't have these problems...His enemies are intentionally trying to smear him by letting this leak out.\"</p> <p>A US diplomatic cable obtained by Wikileaks, dating from 2007, quoted an executive in Shanghai as saying: \"Wen is disgusted with his family's activities, but is either unable or unwilling to curtail them.\" </p> <p>In March, the prime minister made a point of telling reporters at his annual press conference that he had \"never pursued personal gain\", adding that while he had faced criticism, \"history will have the final say\". </p> <p>Wen's mother's shares, and those of other relatives, were held via an investment vehicle, Taihong, run by a wealthy businesswoman close to Wen's wife. Duan Weihong told the Times that the investments were actually her own but she had sought a low profile so asked relatives to find other people to hold the shares on her behalf; they had by \"accident\" and without her knowledge chosen the prime minister's relatives. </p> <p>Wen's wife Zhang Beili, who is rarely seen with her husband, works in the diamond trade. Their son Winston Wen runs New Horizon Capital, now one of China's biggest private equity funds. </p> <p>His wife Yang Xiaomeng told the Times: \"Everything that has been written about him has been wrong.</p> <p>\"He's really not doing that much business anymore.\"</p> <p>The Times said the Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the investments, the prime minister or his relatives. Members of Wen's family also declined to comment or did not respond.</p> <p>The Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a Guardian request for comment. </p> <p>Separately, the Brookings Institution said the brother of the man expected to replace Wen Jiabao - Li Keqiang, already vice premier - <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-25/china-leader-s-job-at-odds-with-tobacco-ties-brookings-says-1-.html\">should be moved from his post as a senior official at China's state-owned tobacco monopoly</a>. Li oversees public health as part of his duties. </p> <p>His younger brother Li Keming is deputy director of the tobacco body and Cheng Li, author of the Brookings report, suggested his role might have set back attempts to curb tobacco use in China.</p>",
  "<p>David Laws has accused teachers of hindering social mobility by failing to encourage children to \"reach for the stars\".</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat education minister blamed school staff and careers advisers for the \"depressingly low expectations\" of many young people. He claimed too many children were led to believe that top exam grades, places at elite universities and high flying careers were beyond them.</p> <p>Even in relatively affluent parts of the country, schools were failing to encourage children to aim high and telling them a local job should be the summit of their ambition, Laws told the Daily Telegraph.</p> <p>He said: \"Teachers, colleges, careers advisers have a role and a responsibility to aim for the stars and to encourage people to believe they can reach the top in education and employment. That's not happening as much as it should do at the moment.\"</p> <p>The comments by Laws, a close ally of deputy prime minister Nick Clegg who returned to the government in last month's reshuffle, are likely to further aggravate teaching unions already at odds with ministers over education reforms.</p> <p>Laws said that outside London many young people believed that careers in law, journalism or banking were effectively closed to them.</p> <p>\"Even in my own constituency, Yeovil, which would not be regarded as one of the deprivation blackspots of the country, most young people would regard going into investment banking as almost leaving the country, because it's a different world,\" he said. \"They will often be encouraged to think it is beyond them.\"</p> <p>His comments come a week after the government was warned that social mobility was now \"flatlining at best\" by its independent adviser Alan Milburn. The former Labour health secretary called on the government and universities to make changes to encourage and fund students from disadvantaged backgrounds to enter higher education.</p> <p>Laws resigned as chief secretary to the Treasury in 2011 after he claimed more than \u00a340,000 in expenses for rent paid to his partner. He was subsequently found guilty of breaching six House of Commons rules in a report by the parliament's standards watchdog.</p>"
