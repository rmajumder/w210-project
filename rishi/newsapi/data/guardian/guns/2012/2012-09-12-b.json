He described the killing, the first of a US ambassador since 1979, as \"outrageous and shocking\". </p> <p>Crucially, though, the president made it clear that the US would work alongside the Libyan government to track down those responsible and would not be turning its back on the Arab spring in Libya or elsewhere in the Middle East.</p> <p>\"This attack will not break the bonds between the United States and Libya,\" he said.</p> <p>One witness told the Guardian that a mob fired at least one rocket at the consulate building then stormed it, setting everything ablaze. Stevens is understood to have died from smoke inhalation. Several Libyan security officers were also reported to have been killed in the attack.</p> <p>The Libyan government expressed deep regret over the attack. The country's interim leader, Mohammed Magarief, apologised, calling the killings \"cowardly criminal acts\" and part of a campaign \"to impede our democratic experiment\".</p> <p>The FBI is being dispatched to Libya to help with the hunt, as well as 50 marines to reinforce the Tripoli embassy. Two US warships were reportedly heading towards the Libyan coast on Wednesday night. US surveillance drones are being redeployed to search for suspects among alleged jihadist camps in eastern Libya.</p> <p>The state department ordered the evacuation of all non-essential staff from the country.</p> <p>US secretary of state Hillary Clinton blamed the killings on \"a small and savage group\". CNN reported a senior US official saying the assault was planned to coincide with the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington and that those responsible used the protests as cover. The fact that a rocket-propelled grenade was used is cited as evidence.</p> <p>Congressman Mike Rogers, head of the House intelligence committee, who is usually briefed by the intelligence agencies during a crisis, said details were still fuzzy but it was \"a well co-ordinated attack\", one in which he said he could see the \"signature of al-Qaida\" and a link to the 9/11 anniversary.</p> <p>Rogers, a former FBI agent, told CNN: \"It has all the hallmarks of an al-Qaida-style event.\"</p> <p>Jay Carney, Obama's White House spokesman, responding to a question from a journalist whether the consulate attack was planned, said: \"It's too early for us to make that judgment.\"</p> <p>Mohammed el-Kish, a former official with the National Transitional Council, which handed power to an elected parliament last month, blamed the attack on hardline jihadists, as did the Quilliam thinktank in London which tracks jihadist groups. </p> <p>But other officials cautioned against jumping to conclusions, suggesting that the attack was more likely to have been opportunistic than planned many days in advance.</p> <p>The killings led to a political row between Obama and his Republican presidential rival Mitt Romney. In what may turn out to be one of the defining moments in the race for the White House, Romney attempted to pin some of the blame on the Obama administration, accusing it of being an apologist for American values.</p> <p>It was a badly-handled, confused intervention that immediately backfired, with former diplomats, foreign policy analysts and even fellow-Republicans accusing Romney of behaving in an unpresidential manner, making political points with the American corpses barely cold. </p> <p>Stevens, 52, a career diplomat since 1991, had been a strong backer of the rebels, going into Benghazi at the height of the revolt aboard a cargo ship. </p> <p>Also killed was another diplomat, Sean Smith, an air force veteran who was based in the Hague but was on temporary transfer to Libya. The other two Americans were security staff. </p> <p>A senior Obama administration official said three staff were wounded in addition to the four killed. The official ran through the timeline, saying the attackers opened fire about 10pm Libyan time and within 15 minutes they had gained access to the compound shot. They attacked the main building which held three staff, Stevens, Smith and a regional security officer and which caught fire. </p> <p>\"They became separated from each other due to the heavy, dark smoke while they were trying to evacuate the burning building. The regional security officer made it outside, and then he and other security personnel returned into the burning building in an attempt to rescue Chris and Sean. </p> <p>\"At that time, they found Sean. He was already dead, and they pulled him from the building. They were unable, however, to locate Chris before they were driven from the building due to the heavy fire and smoke and the continuing small arms fire.\"</p> <p>Exchanges of gunfire continued for a further four hours until Libyan security forces helped the US gain control. Stevens body was found and taken to a hospital in Benghazi.</p> <p>The attack in Benghazi came after a protest at the US embassy in Cairo on Tuesday afternoon over an American-produced amateur film denigrating Muslims. This was ostensibly the motive behind the protests in Benghazi too.</p> <p>It was supposedly made by a Californian real estate developer called Sam Bacile, and both the Associated Press and the Wall St Journal had quoted somebody using that name saying that he was in hiding. </p> <p>But by Wednesday evening, there were signs that Bacile did not exist and it was unclear who was behind the production. Cast members said they had been duped into making it and that anti-Islamic dialogue had been dubbed on later.</p> <p>Obama, in an apparent swipe at the film, said the US was a nation that respected all faiths and \"we reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others\". In spite of that, he added: \"There is no justification for this senseless violence. None. The world must stand together to unequivocally reject these brutal acts.\"</p> <p>The ambassador's killing follows an attack in June on the UK ambassador to Libya, Dominic Asquith. Two British bodyguards were injured after a rocket was fired at Asquith's convoy in Benghazi. There have been similar attacks on the Red Cross and the UN premises. The UK foreign secretary, William Hague, condemned the attack as \"brutal and senseless\".</p> <p>According to the Libya Herald, which cited local witnesses, the killers included members of the hardline Islamist group Ansar al-Sharia. But a spokesman, Hani al-Mansouri, told the Guardian the allegation was false.</p> <p>Noman Benotman, a former Libyan jihadi who now runs the Quilliam thinktank in London, said he had information it was a terrorist attack that was planned to avenge Abu Yahya al-Libi, al-Qaida's Libyan second-in-command, who was killed in a US drone strike a few months ago. </p> <p>Egypt's president, Mohammed Morsi, who used to lead the country's Muslim Brotherhood, was criticised for not speaking out to condemn the Cairo incident. But he asked the Egyptian embassy in Washington to take legal action in the US against the makers of a film. </p> <p>The Brotherhood called for nationwide protests on Friday outside all main mosques. \"The president has to balance between his domestic alliances with ultraconservative Islamists and Egypt's relations with the US on the foreign affairs front,\" said analyst Khalil a-Anani.</p> <p>As anger over the film spread across the Muslim world, the Afghan government gave orders for YouTube to be closed to the public until the offending film was removed, though the site was still visible to internet users in Kabul.</p> <p>\u2022 Additional reporting by Luke Harding, Chris Stephen and Sarah Sirgany.</p>",
  "<p>Peruvian food's having a bit of what the fashion desk might call a \"moment\" \u2013 in the novelty-hungry capital at least. I shall have to rely on all of you outside the London bubble to inform me whether Margate is currently going mad for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sopa_de_mondongo\">mondongo</a>, or Crewe crazy for <a href=\"http://gosouthamerica.about.com/od/cuisine/a/cuy.htm\">cuy</a>, but here three new restaurants specialising in the Peruvian cuisine have opened in the last six months. And, of course, in the manner of any self-respecting food trend there's a Peruvian pop-up, called, rather wonderfully, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TLDOPisco\">The Last Days of Pisco</a>.</p> <p>Many of the dishes on offer \u2013 the halibut with Andean herbs at <a href=\"http://www.limalondon.com/\">Lima London</a>, or the pumpkin and sweet potato doughnuts at <a href=\"http://www.tierraperu.co.uk/\">Tierra Peru</a> \u2013 are not likely to become staples in British kitchens, but one dish which appears on all the menus, ceviche, really deserves to be brought to the attention of fish lovers. OK, so it's not strictly Peruvian \u2013 it's common throughout Latin America, and I first came across it at a Mexican beach shack, but it's so associated with the country that they've declared a national holiday in honour of this vital piece of their culinary heritage.<br><br>Ceviche, for those that steer clear of such vulgar things as trends, is, at its most basic, raw fish marinated in citrus juice and spices; the acid in the juice <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A36202-2004Nov9.html\">denatures the proteins</a> in the meat in much the same way as cooking would. The flesh becomes opaque, the texture firmer and dryer, yet the flavours remain spanking fresh: it's the perfect zingy dish for a warm autumn day. American chef Rick Moonen describes it as a \"citrus cocktail\", which sounds about right.</p> <p>In Ecuador, they commonly add tomato sauce, while in Central America ceviche is often served salsa-style with tacos or tostadas, but in Peru, simplicity seems to reign supreme. Fish or shellfish, citrus, chilli, perhaps some onion \u2013 why would you want anything more? As the American writer Calvin Trillin put it in a <a href=\"http://www.gourmet.com/magazine/2000s/2000/08/ceviche?currentPage=2\">wonderful article on the subject</a> for the now-defunct Gourmet magazine, \"I would imagine that Peruvians consider their version of ceviche stately and Ecuadoreans consider it dull.\" But trust me, for the British palate, at least, the dish is anything but.</p> <h2>The fish</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396151656\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/12/1347462529239/Olive-magazine-recipe-cev-002.jpg\" alt=\"Olive magazine recipe ceviche\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olive magazine recipe ceviche - an unusual mixture of salmon and plaice. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It goes without saying that any fish served raw should be spanking fresh, but even in Peru there's no single species that's particularly favoured for ceviche. It makes sense to use the local catch and the species used changes depending on availability: inland, freshwater fish such as trout replace the corvina, sea bass or shark of the coast. Henrietta Clancy, chef at the Last Days of Pisco (and, in the spirit of full and frank disclosure, also a good friend of mine) has experimented with various species. In theory, she says, any white fish can be used, but \"many fragile fish can become rubbery or totally dissolve in the lime juice\".</p> <p>She plumps for sea bass: it retains its flavour and texture and is the closest thing to the tilapia she ate in Peru last year. Martin Morales, the man behind the appropriately-named Ceviche in Soho, suggests <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/jan/13/martin-morales-ceviche-recipe-peru\">\"dover sole or other white fish\"</a>, Tom Aikens recommends sea bream in his fish cookbook, and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Nick Fisher suggest black bream or sea bass in The River Cottage Fish Book noting, like Henrietta, that \"firm, well-muscled varieties such as bream and bass are ideal ... but we have had good results with gurnard and pollack as well\". Elisabeth Luard, author of The Latin American Kitchen, <a href=\"http://citypalate.ca/recipes/allrecipes.php?idrecipes=595&amp;category=Seafood\">calls for salmon in a recipe</a> I clipped out of Waitrose Food Illustrated years ago and have been using ever since, and olive magazine uses a mixture of plaice and salmon.</p> <p>I find the salmon too strong a flavour: it's nice, but it doesn't take on the flavour of the lime and spices in the same way as the white fish. Plaice and sole, meanwhile, seem a little dry and flaky once marinated. The bass and bream get the universal thumbs up: as Henrietta suggested, they stand up well to the acid, remaining juicy throughout.</p> <h2>To dice or slice?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396151657\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/12/1347462305162/Tom-Aikens-recipe-ceviche-002.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Aikens recipe ceviche\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Aikens recipe ceviche. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The cut is also important, and suggestions range from largeish (3x2cm chunks) from Morales to slicing the fish <a href=\"http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/4347/ceviche\">\"as thinly as possible\" from olive</a>. Henrietta advises that dicing, rather than slicing, will \"ensure a good distribution of raw fish and fish cooked on the outside\" \u2013 contrast between the inside and the outside is important, but I actually find that, with Martin's recipe, there's too much raw fish because the chunks are so large. I prefer the more intense citrus flavour of Tom Aikens' small dice, but I'm going to make them slightly bigger to highlight the different textures in the dish.</p> <h2>Citrus</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396151658\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/12/1347464606007/A-lime-002.jpg\" alt=\"A lime\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lime. Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The chief marinating ingredient is, of course, citrus juice. Lime is most commonly used, but lemons and even Seville oranges are sometimes seen (the latter, unlike ordinary oranges, having the requisite acidity for the job). I can't find any recipes calling for them, perhaps fortunately, as they're not in season, but <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/4food/recipes/chefs/hugh-fearnley-whittingstall/black-bream-ceviche-07-11-08\">Hugh and Nick's</a> does utilise a mixture of lime, lemon and orange. Aikens uses lemon, zest and juice, while everyone else sticks with lime in varying amounts, Morales using 15 for 600g of fish, nearly five times as many as the olive recipe.</p> <p>I prefer the fruity sharpness of limes here to the sourness of lemons, but Henrietta tells me she feels that the limes in this country are less sweet than the ones in Peru. So although I can't really taste it in the River Cottage marinade, I adopt the idea of adding orange juice to tame the sourness. The bitterness of the zest, though, feels wrong here \u2013 it's a distraction from the clean flavour of the juice. </p> <p>Henrietta uses mixed peel in her celery, parsley and orange ceviche, which I really like \u2013 the sweetness is a pleasant contrast to the zingy marinade, but I have to concede that it's probably not an essential. It is, however, absolutely vital to use a generous amount of citrus \u2013 that way you get a good spoonful along with the fish. Peruvians often drink the leftover marinade, known as tiger's milk, after finishing the dish itself, but this is strictly optional \u2013 as a hangover cure, it's in the do or die category.</p> <h2>Alliums</h2> <p>Alliums of some sort are almost non-negotiable: Aikens and olive use finely chopped shallots while everyone else goes for red onion. I prefer the more straightforward sweetness of the latter, but I think soaking it in iced water briefly before use, like Morales, is essential if it isn't to overpower the entire dish. It seems more usual to leave the onion in thin strips, but I'm going to finely dice it so every bite of ceviche has a good balance of flavour.</p> <h2>Spices and other ingredients</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396151659\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/12/1347463491385/The-Last-Days-of-Pisco-re-002.jpg\" alt=\"The Last Days of Pisco recipe ceviche\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Last Days of Pisco recipe ceviche. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everyone apart from Aikens uses chilli, but the only recipe I find calling for the <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/06/spice-hunting-aji-amarillo-chile.html\">aji amarillo</a>, a fruity pepper described by Henrietta as having a citrussy, almost pineapple-like flavour and popular in Peruvian cooking, is her own. They're difficult to track down in this country, but you can order them dried online, or find them frozen in South American shops \u2013 I reconstitute a dried chilli, and pound it into a paste for Henrietta's ceviche. The fruity tanginess works well with the lime, and if you can find it, it's well worth a try, but a vibrant red bird's eye chilli will add heat and a splash of colour if not.</p> <p>Generosity with the salt, a step missed by many recipes, seems essential: the twin punch of the lime and the salt is an essential part of ceviche's appeal. Henrietta rubs it on the fish and leaves it to sit for a minute so the surface \"is more receptive to the marinating liquid\". This is a good tip: the fish seems to absorb the flavours better, both of the marinade and the seasoning itself.</p> <p>Herbs like coriander and parsley are often included to add freshness: coriander is most popular in the recipes I try, but Flor Arcaya de Deliot, author of <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781903141687\">The Food and Cooking of Peru</a>, uses parsley instead, as well as celery, which also features in the River Cottage recipe. I find the pepperiness of the parsley less pleasing with the lime and the fish than the fresh flavour of the coriander.</p> <h2>Marinating time</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396151660\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/12/1347462210147/Flor-Arcaya-de-Deliot-rec-002.jpg\" alt=\"Flor Arcaya de Deliot recipe ceviche\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flor Arcaya de Deliot recipe ceviche.

I find even 4 hours excessive: the fish has become chalky and dry. Tom's, meanwhile, is good, but undeniably sashimi-like (the Peruvians in fact <a href=\"http://perudelights.com/is-it-carpaccio-is-it-sashimi-no-its-tiradito/\">have their own version of this</a>, called tiradito). Flor goes for 30 minutes, while Henrietta says she tends to tend towards a shorter marination, to maximise the contrast \"between what your dish tastes like at the beginning of the meal compared to what you get at the end\". I find 10 minutes perfect: the outside layer of the fish has absorbed the flavour of the marinade, while the insides remain soft and juicy. So simple, yet so utterly delicious.</p> <h2>Perfect ceviche</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396151661\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/12/1347461646208/Felicitys-perfect-ceviche-006.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity's perfect ceviche\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity's perfect ceviche.

  "<p>An NHS hospital is being sued by a family who say doctors placed a \"do not resuscitate\" order on their relative, denying him potentially life-saving treatment, because he has Down's syndrome.</p> <p>The unnamed family are bringing a legal challenge against a hospital in Kent where a doctor apparently decided staff should make no attempt to resuscitate the patient if he suffered cardiac or respiratory arrest, on the basis of his disability.</p> <p>Lawyers for the family said a form added to the man's medical notes last September gave the reasons for no resuscitation as \"Down's syndrome\", \"unable to swallow\" (the man has a feeding tube in his stomach), \"bedbound\" and \"learning difficulties\".</p> <p>The form, which said the decision should remain in force indefinitely, showed the doctor concerned had no discussion with the patient because the patient did not have mental capacity, said the lawyers.</p> <p>The man, referred to as AWA, is still alive and in residential care a year later, after his carers argued for the DNR to be removed.</p> <p>No information was given to his next of kin or sought from them, because they were \"unavailable\". A space where clinicians should report whether an information leaflet about such decisions has been given to AWA's family was blank.</p> <p>Subsequent inquiries revealed that another DNR had been issued on the same patient, who also has dementia, a month earlier.</p> <p>A close relative, X, who is also the man's \"litigation friend\", told the Guardian AWA's treatment had been \"degrading and disgraceful\".</p> <p>East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust said it could not comment on the case for legal reasons, but said it had \"put a great deal in place in recent years to meet the needs of vulnerable patients\" and had signed up to the Mencap charity's \"Getting it right\" charter on helping those with learning disability. It had a \"clear and robust policy\" on decisions not to attempt resuscitation which complied with professional guidance, it said.</p> <p>News of the legal action comes two months before the high court in London conducts a judicial review of the actions of Addenbrooke's hospital, Cambridge, and health ministers over DNRs in a case brought by David Tracey, whose wife, Janet, died at Addenbrooke's.</p> <p>Both the hospital and health department deny breaches of the Human Rights Act. There is no national government policy in England on DNRs, although hospitals should have local ones.</p> <p>Sensitive life and death decisions of a different kind have been raised by cases brought by two severely disabled people with locked-in syndrome, Tony Nicklinson and a man known as Martin. Last month they lost a high court battle for permission to die with medical help.</p> <p>X said AWA had gone into residential care in late 2010 after being cared for by his parents for nearly 50 years. In August 2011 he was admitted to Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother hospital in Margate to have a feeding tube fitted. He returned there in September after problems with the tube.</p> <p>After he was discharged, a carer unpacking his bag found a DNR form. \"It was folded in four in his belongings. She was absolutely horrified. The issue had not been discussed with any relatives at the hospital,\" X said.</p> <p>The home alerted AWA's community learning disabilities nurse, who telephoned the hospital and challenged the doctor. \"Basically the doctor stated that with Down's syndrome at his age, people's reserve is limited, that they age faster than the rest of the population and have associated heart problems\".</p> <p>AWA had been admitted to hospital again, this time to Kent and Canterbury hospital, with pneumonia, and the nurse had to talk to a trust executive before the DNR form was removed, X said. \"I was very angry and was ready to storm into the hospital. It is just not acceptable, not being consulted on whether someone lives or dies.\"</p> <p>AWA was unaware of the DNR or the legal case, X said, but \"a year on, he is sitting up in his chair and getting the best possible care \u2026 he seems well in himself\".</p> <p>Merry Varney, of the law firm Leigh Day &amp; Co, representing X, said the case was one of most extreme it had seen. \"To use Down's syndrome and learning difficulties as a reason to withhold lifesaving treatment is nothing short of blatant discrimination,\" she said.</p> <p>\"If an individual was physically preventing a doctor from administering life-saving treatment to a disabled relative, it would undoubtedly be a matter for police, yet we see doctors taking this decision without consent or consultation regularly. The absurdity of this is highlighted by the strict rules preventing patients such as Tony Nicklinson and our own case of Martin, people with capacity trying to make decisions to end their own life.\"</p> <p>Varney added: \"Having applied for and received AWA's medical notes, an earlier DNR appears to have been imposed, which we understand the family also had no knowledge of. Families and carers of those lacking mental capacity want to and have a right to be involved in decisions affecting access to medical treatment, yet both DNRs record that no family member or next of kin was consulted or informed.\"</p> <p>Mencap has previously <a href=\"http://www.mencap.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/Death%20by%20Indifference%20-%2074%20Deaths%20and%20counting.pdf\" title=\"\">criticised the NHS's treatment of those with learning difficulties, including the use of DNRs</a>. Beverley Dawkins, its policy adviser on health, said: \"It is a serious problem \u2026 It is institutional discrimination.\"</p> <h2>Whose decision?</h2> <p>Behind the stark initials scattered through documents across the NHS and medical lawyers' officers \u2013 DNACPR (do not attempt cardio-pulmonary resuscitation), DNAR (do not attempt resuscitation), DNR (do not resuscitate) \u2013 lies a fraught debate over life and death choices.</p> <p>Any decision not to attempt resuscitation legally rests with doctors, according to their regulator, the General Medical Council. They have no obligation to prolong life if they do not think it to patients' benefit.</p> <p>Professional guidance from the British Medical Association, Resuscitation Council and Royal College of Nursing says for patients with mental capacity there should also be sensitive exploration of the \"patient's wishes, feelings, beliefs and values\". But a discussion should not be forced on them. Doctors' leaders also say good practice mean that, with patients' permission, such decisions should involve families.</p> <p>If a patient lacks capacity, any previously expressed wishes should be considered,says the guidance. There should also be be discussion and agreement between the healthcare team and those close to or representing the patient.</p> <p>If they have a welfare attorney or guardian, this person must be consulted about CPR decisions.\"Where a patient has not appointed a welfare attorney or made an advance decision, the treatment decision rests with the most senior clinician in charge of the patient's care. </p> <p>\"The views of those close to the patient should be sought, unless this is impossible, to determine any previously expressed wishes and what level or chance of recovery the patient would be likely to consider of benefit, given the inherent risks and adverse effects of CPR.\"</p> <p>In England and Wales, \"the Mental Capacity Act requires that best-interests decisions must include seeking the views of anyone named by the patient as someone to be consulted, anyone engaged in caring for the person or interested in the patient's welfare,\" says the guidance.</p> <p>In England, unlike Scotland, there is no national NHS policy. It is left to local trusts.</p> <p><em>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 September to add an additional element that was missing due to an error in the production process</em></p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama has stepped into the political row over Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's ill-judged response to the Benghazi consulate attack.</p> <p>Romney faced heavy criticism from across the political spectrum for statements issued on Tuesday evening and repeated at a press conference on Wednesday morning in which he accused the Obama administration of being too ready to apologise for American values.</p> <p>Former diplomats, foreign policy analysts and many Republicans distanced themselves from Romney's remarks, accusing him of being premature in trying to make political capital out of a fatal attack on US diplomats. To add to his problems, the statements were quickly shown to be factually inaccurate.</p> <p>On Wednesday morning, Obama had remained above the fray, focusing a statement in the White House rose garden on paying tribute to US ambassador Chris Stevens and the three other Americans who were killed, and promising justice.</p> <p>But by mid-afternoon, while flying to a campaign stop in Las Vegas on Air Force One, he had engaged with the political row. In an interview with CBS, Obama said: \"You know, Governor Romney seems to have a tendency to shoot first and aim later.\"</p> <p>He added: \"As president, one of the things I've learned is you can't do that. It's important for you to make sure that the statements that you make are backed up by the facts. And that you've thought through the ramifications before you make them.\"</p> <p>Asked if Romney's statements were \"irresponsible,\" Obama replied: 'I'll let the American people judge that.\"</p> <p>\"I think most Americans, Democrats or Republicans, understand that there are times when we set politics aside, and one of those is when we've got a direct threat to American personnel overseas,\" Obama said.</p> <p>\"And so I think that if you look at how most Republicans, most elected officials, have reacted, they've reacted responsibly, waiting to find out the facts before they talk, making sure that our number one priority is the safety and security of American personnel.\"</p> <p>Romney's disastrous 24 hours began late on Tuesday \u2013 the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks \u2013 in the wake of protests at the embassy in Cairo and as the Benghazi consulate attack was still unfolding.</p> <p>He picked up on a statement by Cairo embassy staff expressing sympathy with Muslims angry over an anti-Islamic film apparently made in California. The embassy condemned \"continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims\". Romney characterised this as an apology by the Obama administration for the right to free speech.</p> <p>Waking up on Wednesday morning to critical reviews \u2013 and the news that the ambassador and three others were dead \u2013 Romney nevertheless repeated the attack, and went as far as to accuse Obama of sympathising with the Cairo protesters.</p> <p>\"They clearly sent mixed messages to the world, and the statement that came from the administration and the embassy is the administration,\" he said during his hastily-convened press conference. \"The statement that came from the administration was a statement akin to an apology.\"</p> <p>Romney was pressed repeatedly by reporters about whether he had jumped the gun in issuing his statement. But he insisted he had not made a mistake.</p> <p>It could turn out to be one of the defining moments of the 2012 election, one that again exposed Romney's lack of foreign policy experience. It may have done him more damage than all the millions of spent on negative campaign ads over the last two months by the Obama campaign.</p> <p>Many senior Republicans greeted the renewed attack with horror, briefing reporters that Romney had made a catastrophic error of judgment that could have fatal consequences for his election campaign.</p> <p>John McCain, the 2008 presidential candidate and a backer of Romney, refused to be drawn. But he did send a tweet applauding secretary of state Hillary Clinton for the tone of her statement, in which she said that the killings should not lead to a break in US-Libyan relations. </p> <p>The Brookings Institution's Martin Indyk, a former ambassador who served in the Clinton administration, told CNN issues such as these should not be used as political footballs. He added that Romney should have held back for at least a day.</p> <p>The Democratic chairman of the Senate foreign affairs committee, John Kerry, said it was irresponsible, inexperienced and callous for Romney to make statements before knowing the facts.</p> <p>\"I don't think he knows what he is talking about,\" Kerry said.</p>",
  "<p>Chris Stevens, the US ambassador to Libya killed in an attack on the consulate in Benghazi, was the sort of diplomat that America can ill afford to lose. Deeply knowledgable after more than 20 years in the Arab world, and personable too, if anyone could start to reverse the deep suspicion in which America is held in the Arab world, it would be someone like him.</p> <p>That he met his end along with three others in Benghazi, the city that considered itself saved by Nato's bombardment, demonstrates how volatile allegiances in post revolutionary Libya are. If anyone doubts this, look what then happened to the vote parliament was due to take on a new prime minister. The pro-western candidate Mahmoud Jibril lost and Mustafa Abushagur, a candidate considered acceptable to both liberals and Islamists, won.</p> <p>If the circumstances of the firefight that led to the ambassador's death are unclear (there were conflicting reports last night about whether the attack was planned) the provenance of a grotesquely offensive film that depicts the prophet Muhammad as a feckless philanderer, which provoked the anti-US protests, was today equally murky.</p> <p>The film was attributed by US media reports to a man whom no one can now find any trace of. Indeed the original film may not have existed at all. A clip, dubbed in Arabic, was promoted by a virulent Islamophobe, Morris Sadik, an Egyptian Copt based in California, who campaigns for Egypt to be divided into five states and whose views are disowned by Christian Copts at home. The final poison of this toxic brew was added by the Florida pastor Terry Jones, who has a track record in inciting violence by burning the Qur'an.</p> <p>The whole episode may have been a grotesque provocation, of which all sides taking positions in this culture war should be wary.</p> <p>The revolutions in Libya and Egypt have represented \u2013 until now \u2013 a defeat for Ayman al-Zawahiri, the Egyptian-born doctor and ideologue behind Osama bin Laden's global terror campaign. His deadliest enemies are fellow Islamists \u2013 the proponents of non-violent political Islam who are now in power in Egypt and Tunisia and who are trying to lay the foundations of law-based democratic states.</p> <p>After a long period of hesitation, the US, Britain and France are about to invest heavily in the Egyptian presidency of Mohamed Morsi. The consulate attack came on the final day of a big US business delegation. Egypt is broke and in desperate need of foreign investment and both it and Libya remain highly volatile. They are critically vulnerable to grenades lobbed from afar, in this case from diaspora communities in California. It is clear where Egyptian and US interests of the type that Stevens was trying to forge lie. They lie in working together for a better future for the Arab world.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 14 September 2012 because the original misnamed Libya's new prime minister as Mustafa al-Shakoura. He is Mustafa Abushagur.</p>",
  "<p>The image of a smirking Mitt Romney as he walked away from his press conference regarding the terrorist attacks in Libya is his <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6071148/ns/politics-campaign_ad_watch/t/new-bush-ad-says-kerry-shifts-wind/\">John Kerry-windsurfing moment</a>. Much as with the Kerry image, critics are making too much of a fleeting moment: Romney partisans are correct to point out that <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/12/mitt-romney-obama-adminstration_n_1877295.html\">Romney's expression</a> is only that \u2013 not a deep-seated reflection of an inner belief.</p> <p>Kerry was (and is) a serious person who made thoughtful and deliberate decisions about policy. His hobbies didn't carry a hidden meaning. Romney is a serious person who, no doubt, feels the loss of a fellow American as deeply as any patriot.</p> <p>I make jokes about his robotic affect (I had to resist making one just now) not because I genuinely believe he's uncaring, but because his stiffness so aptly reflects his cold-blooded professionalism and efficiency (he enjoys <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57355212-503544/mitt-romney-i-like-being-able-to-fire-people-for-bad-service/\">firing people!</a> <em>He put a dog on the roof of his car</em>). As with so much in politics, there's the literal truth and what we feel to be true. When an image, or a phrase or a joke resonates with the public, it's usually because the difference between the two harmonizes rather than clashes.</p> <p>That dissonance is why Clint Eastwood's characterization of <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/08/30/clint-eastwood-talks-to-imaginary-obama/\">Invisible Obama</a> as vulgar and obnoxious felt not just baffling, but <em>wrong</em>. Obama, if anything, is too polite and restrained \u2013 to the point of paralysis.

And Romney has this very day shown himself too willing to use international tragedy for personal gain \u2013 <a href=\"http://cdn.theatlanticwire.com/img/upload/2012/09/12/rendered/3ba6cc083a1e6b11a098475cc7b82641_250x534.jpg\">the expression</a> captured by the camera may have been an accident of musculature but it doesn't <em>feel</em> that way.</p> <p>It feels like <a href=\"http://www.americablog.com/2012/09/romney-blasted-for-politicizing-death.html\">the self-satisfied snicker</a> of someone walking away from the negotiating table knowing (or thinking) he put one over on the other guy. One assumes Romney had a much less smug expression on his face as the timeline of today's events unfolded, and clarity about their causes and motivations emerged.</p> <p>Romney's campaign, it turns out, was in the midst of cynically spinning a Tweet (a Tweet!) from the US embassy in Cairo into an \"administration apology\", even as Libyan terrorists <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/news-agencies-us-ambassador-to-libya-killed-in-attack-outside-consulate/2012/09/12/665de5fc-fcc4-11e1-a31e-804fccb658f9_story.html\">used the protests as cover for a premeditated strike</a>. The anti-Muslim film trailer that prompted the protests \u2013 and was the subject of the Cairo embassy's criticism \u2013 was convenient, not causal.</p> <p>Given the GOP's kneejerk invocation of Obama's \"apologetic\" foreign policy, you'd think the Romney campaign would have been able to spot someone else opportunistically using a tangentially-related event for a premeditated attack.</p> <p>Reporters soon uncovered a set of Romney talking points aimed at justifying its previous, premature talking points. \"Did Governor Romney 'jump the gun' last night in releasing his statement?\" went the not-very-hypothetical question. Suggested response? \"No. It is never too soon to stand up for American values and interests.\" The speed of this rationalization does not make the initial attack seem any less premeditated, just not very well thought-out. The Romney campaign reacts rather than responds. This is not what one wants in a commander-in-chief.</p> <p>We've gotten jaded about tragedy being co-opted for political purposes. The campaigns' advertising <a href=\"http://www.newser.com/article/da17sbdo2/for-911-presidential-campaigns-suspend-partisan-digs-but-politics-continues-on-anniversary.html\">boycott on 9/11</a> is a subtle confirmation just how deeply ingrained the expectation is \u2013 the boycott itself proof that the subconscious tendency must be overtly checked. Pols and pundits on all sides often get away with capitalizing on pain because we all know they all do it.</p> <p>There is an implicit wink behind the more outrageous attacks. Obama does not believe that Romney actively <em>hates</em> women. Romney does not doubt that Obama <em>was</em> born in Hawaii. If some voters on the fringe believe the worst? Hey, the Etch-a-Sketch will be shaken, and campaign slurs often fade in the amnesiac, slow-motion blur of actual governing.</p> <p>But sometimes, the wink isn't just a wink. It's a tic, an unthinking habit that won't go away. The Romney reaction to the news out of Libya suggests something even more dangerous: a habit of unthinking. As Fred Exley put it, in his classic A Fan's Notes, bemoaning the latent cynicism that allows good people to excuse themselves for doing bad things:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A wink eventually becomes a twitch, the twitch a sign of some inner disturbance.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<h2><strong>Ignored warnings from history</strong></h2> <p>The Hillsborough Panel found the safety of fans admitted to the terrace at the Leppings Lane end of the ground was \"compromised at every level\". From the condition of the turnstiles to the management of the crowd, alterations to the terrace, the construction of the \"pens\" in which fans were held, the placement of the crush barriers and the access to the fateful central pens via a tunnel with a one in six gradient. The deficiencies were \"well known\" and made the crush on 15 April 1989 foreseeable.</p> <p>According to documents disclosed to the inquiry, there was a serious crush on the terrace at the 1981 FA Cup semi-final between Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers in which \"many people were injured and fatalities narrowly avoided\". New documents show following that incident there was a breakdown in the relationship between Sheffield Wednesday and South Yorkshire Police, which considered the capacity of the terrace too high at 10,100.</p> <p>The ground was not used for semi finals again until 1987, by which time there had been various moderations and alterations \u2013 none of which led to revised safety certificates. Recommendations to feed the pens from designated turnstiles, enabling the club to monitor the number of fans in each one, were ignored because it would cost too much.</p> <p>\"It is evident from the disclosed documents that South Yorkshire Police were preoccupied with crowd management [but] ... Sheffield Wednesday's primary concern was to limit costs.\" The issue of congested access to the turnstiles remained unresolved, with over 24,000 fans entering through 23 turnstiles at Leppings Lane. The panel found that key issues were not \"discussed or recorded\" at annual safety inspections. There was a delayed kick off at the 1987 FA Cup semi-final and crushing at the 1988 semi-final. The debriefings from both were \"inadequate\".</p> <h2><strong>The day of the disaster and the failings of the police </strong></h2> <p>The decision to replace an experienced match commander, chief superintendent Brian Mole, with one with minimal experience of Hillsborough, chief superintendent David Duckenfield, remains unexplained. But the panel finds that \"flaws in responding to the emerging crisis on the day were rooted in institutional tension within and between organisations\".</p> <p>There was inadequate communication and senior officers' decision making was hampered by a malfunctioning radio system and the design of the control box.</p> <p>The management roles and responsibilites of the police were unclear and the prevailing mindset \"prioritised crowd control over crowd safety\". Duckenfield acceded to a request for exit gate C to be opened to relieve pressure outside the ground but failed to anticipate the impact on the already-packed central pen of fans descending the tunnel directly opposite. There was no instruction given to manage the flow or direction of the incoming crowd. \"From the documents provided to the panel it is clear the crush at the Leppings Lane turnstiles outside the stadium was not caused by fans arriving 'late' for the kick off,\" it concluded.</p> <h2><strong>'Finding their own level'</strong></h2> <p>Unlike previous years, fans were not filtered or checked on their approach to the ground. South Yorkshire police said the distribution of fans between the pens was based on an informal practice that allowed fans to \"find their own level\". Information relating to a crush at the previous year's semi-final was deleted from officers' statements and information showing that they had controlled access to the tunnel once central pens were full was also deleted from some statements. \"Senior SYP officers denied knowledge of tunnel closures at previous semi-finals \u2026 yet SYP officers responsible for closing the tunnel in 1988 claimed they had acted under instructions from senior officers,\" it said.</p> <h2><strong>Emergency response and aftermath </strong></h2> <p>For a prolonged period, the number of casualties and their serious nature overwhelmed those involved in the initial rescue. The panel found the emergency response to the disaster had not previously been fully examined because of the (wrongful) assumption that the outcome for those who died was irretrievably fixed long before they could have helped.</p> <p>Disclosed documents show senior officers interpreted crowd unrest in the Leppings Lane end as a sign of potential disorder and were slow to recognise spectators were being \"crushed, injured and killed\". Ambulance service officers were slower than police to realise the severity of the crush, despite being close to the central pens. Neither fully activated the major incident procedure.</p> <p>Disclosed documents show \"clear and repeated evidence of failures in leadership and emergency response co-ordination\". There was a lack of basic equipment and no triage. Statements and ambulance transcripts reveal opportunities to exercise control were missed for almost an hour. The gymnasium was used as a temporary mortuary for unexplained reasons and intrusive questioning about the social and drinking habits of the deceased was perceived as being insensitive and irrelevant.</p> <h2><strong>Medical evidence</strong></h2> <p>The evidence from pathologists led the coroner, Dr Stefan Popper, to impose a cut off time of 3.15pm for his inquest \u2013 based on the assumption that all of those who died were already critically injured by then. But the panel finds that is unsustainable.The panel found there was \"clear evidence\" that 28 of those who died did not have traumatic asphyxia and it may have taken longer to be fatal. There was separate evidence that the heart and lungs of 31 victimshad continued to function after the crush and that was for a prolonged period in 16 of the cases.</p> <p>Some featured in both groups, but in all 41 victims fell into one or both category. Finally, despite the coroner ordering blood alcohol levels to be taken from all the deceased, there was \"no evidence to support the proposition that alcohol played any part in the genesis of the disaster and it is regrettable that those in positions of responsibility created and promoted a portrayal of drunkness as contributing to the disaster\".</p> <h2><strong>Parallel investigations</strong></h2> <p>Throughout multiple investigations including the Taylor inquiry, the coroner's inquiry and inquest and a criminal inquiry led by West Midlands police, it is evident that South Yorkshire police sought to establish a case emphasising exceptional levels of drunkenness and aggression among Liverpool fans, alleging many arrived at the stadium late, without tickets and determined to force entry.</p> <p>The panel found that Margaret Thatcher was very likely given this version of events when she arrived in Liverpool on the Sunday after the disaster, though it found no evidence she colluded with them.</p> <p>In the immediate aftermath of the disaster, SYP prioritised an internal investigation and the collection of handwritten statements in which officers should consider themselves \"the accused\".</p> <p>Following the publication of the Taylor report, which laid the blame at the door of the police and exonerated the fans, the prime minister was briefed that the \"defensive \u2013 at times close to deceitful \u2013 behaviour by the senior officers in South Yorkshire sounds depressingly familiar\". In cabinet papers Thatcher expresses her concern that the \"broad thrust\" of Taylor's report constitutes \"a devastating criticism of the police\".</p> <h2><strong>Civil litigation</strong></h2> <p>Documents disclosed to the panel show that South Yorkshire police sought to avoid any admission of liability in the settlement of compensation claims and that officers who claimed compensation were pressured to withdraw their own claims.</p> <h2><strong>The coroner's inquiry</strong></h2> <p>Popper decided to hold the inquest in two parts: a \"mini inquest\" for each death, followed by a later generic inquest to consider the circumstances of the disaster. The procedures adopted for the presentation of evidence to the jury prevented its examination. Families' correspondence demonstrates \"serious concerns\" regarding what they considered to be a \"flawed process\".</p> <h2><strong>The generic hearing </strong></h2> <p>It is clear from the documents that South Yorkshire police considered the generic hearings an opportunity to use the court to respond to criticisms levelled against the force by the Taylor report, making it \"adversarial rather than inquisitorial\" in nature.</p> <p>\"There is a substantial amount of documentary evidence concerning the inadequacy of the inquest process\". When Lord Justice Stuart-Smith recognised the complexities and difficulties facing the coroner he considered it had become \"out of control\" and that it would have been more appropriate to adopt the findings of the Taylor inquiry than to conduct a generic hearing.</p> <h2><strong>The 3:15pm \"cut-off\" at the inquest</strong></h2> <p>The coroner at the Sheffield inquest limited evidence to events before 3.15pm the day of the disaster, based on pathologists' evidence that all those who died were by that time beyond recovery.</p> <p>The panel report found that West Midlands police, the investigating force, had also advised a \"cut-off\" of 3.05pm. The 3.15pm cut-off the coroner chose meant that no evidence was taken on the ambulance and emergency response to the disaster.</p> <p>The panel found that there are \"significant doubts\" about the opinion that the victims were beyond recovery and, in fact, 41 victims might have been saved even after 3.15pm had the ambulance response been more effective.</p> <p>\"The imposition of the 3.15pm cut-of severely limited examination of the rescue, evacuation and treatment of those who died,\" the panel concluded. \"This raised profound concerns regarding sufficiency of inquiry and examination of evidence.\"</p> <p>The attorney general Dominic Grieve is considering an application from Anne Williams, whose son Kevin, 15, died at Hillsborough, for a new inquest to be held.</p> <h2><strong>Review and alteration of police and ambulance service statements </strong></h2> <p>It emerged in 1997 that senior South Yorkshire police officers had subjected the statements of junior officers on duty at Hillsborough to a process of \"review and alteration\". The police themselves said it was done to remove \"conjecture\" and \"opinion\" from the junior officers' statements, leaving only matters of fact.</p> <p>However, the panel found that the statements were changed, by senior South Yorkshire police officers working with the force's solicitor, to alter, delete or qualify comments made by officers \"unhelpful to the force's case\".</p> <p>Of 164 statements substantially amended, the panel found 116 were to \"remove or alter comments unfavourable to South Yorkshire police\". Allegations of drunkenness by supporters were emphasised, criticism of the police's own operation or of senior officers was changed or deleted. The panel also found that statements from the South Yorkshire Metropolitan ambulance service were also altered. \"In a number of cases they deflected criticisms and emphasised the efficiency of the SYMAS response.\"</p> <h2><strong>The spreading of unsubstantiated allegations to the media </strong></h2> <p>The panel found that the origin of the \"serious allegations\" of misbehaviour by Liverpool supporters, most infamously carried by the Sun on 19 April 1989, came from Whites Press Agency in Sheffield. The agency was \"informed by\" several South Yorkshire police officers, a police federation spokesperson and Irvine Patnick, a local Conservative MP.</p> <p>The panel found \"there is no evidence\" to support the allegations of drunkenness, ticketlessness and violence by supporters which were spread by the police.</p> <p>The panel also found that the South Yorkshire police chief constable, Peter Wright, encouraged junior officers to present this case to the media, as \"a defence\", to present \"a rock solid story\". The nature of the stories was to falsely blame the supporters for causing the disaster, and ensure the police would be exonerated by Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry.</p> <h2>Conflicting emotions<br></h2> <p>Trevor Hicks, who lost two daughters in the disaster, embraced Ian Ayre, the managing director of Liverpool FC, in a crypt inside the city's Anglican cathedral and whispered: \"What a result.\" Margaret Aspinall, for too long identified as the chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group and not as the mother of James, cut out the celebration. \"We will always be the losers at Hillsborough,\" she said.</p> <p>That conflict of emotion was tangible among the bereaved parents, sisters, brothers and children of the 96 who died at Hillsborough as they digested the findings of the independent panel on Wednesday.</p> <p>Relief was a common factor among those who have spent 23 years seeking the truth in the face of a cover-up that Michael Mansfield QC described as the biggest in British legal history. Dean Harris, who survived the carnage that day, said: \"There has been a cloud hanging over us for 23 years and that has been lifted. It is not a sense of joy but one of relief. This is one of the biggest moments in my life. I have had that weight upon me since I was 16.\"</p> <p>Inevitably, having learned that 41 victims could have been saved, there was anger too.</p> <p>Becky Shah, who lost her mother, Inger, said: \"I have mixed feelings. I am really relieved that Liverpool fans, survivors and the dead have been exonerated, and the city of Liverpool too, which I feel is important and I am not from here. But I was a young woman of 17 who lost her only parent at Hillsborough and the fact it has taken more than half of my life to get to this point is absolutely outrageous in a democratic society.\"<strong> Andy Hunter </strong></p>",
  "<p>Apple's iPhone 5 launch <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/sep/12/iphone-5-launch-apple-live-coverage\">held few surprises</a> on the hardware front, thanks to the barrage of pretty-accurate leaks in the weeks leading up to the event. But now the new handset has been unveiled \u2013&#xa0;as well as a new iPod touch \u2013&#xa0;what are the implications for developers?</p> <p>Well. In the short-term, plenty of apps will be updated to fill that new four-inch screen, although it's not an urgent task. As shown during the launch, existing apps will simply be centered on the new screen, so developers can take a bit more time to figure out how to best make use of that additional space.</p> <p>Games developers will be digesting the potential of the device's new A6 processor, which Apple claims is twice as fast as its predecessor, the A5. Spiffier graphics, then \u2013&#xa0;the phrase \"console-quality\" will become even more bandied-about in the months to come.</p> <p>Yet as the demo of Real Racing 3 at the event showed, innovation is as likely to come from canny use of Apple's software as from its hardware: the idea of \"time-shifted multiplayer\" sounded like a silly attempt to rebrand ghost racing, before EA's Rob Murray explained that players will be able to bump their friends' cars and affect their times \u2013&#xa0;even if that friend raced the day before.</p> <p>The iPhone 5's improved camera will be welcomed by various genres of apps, from augmented reality to barcode-scanners. Evolution rather than revolution, to use a hackneyed but still-appropriate phrase.</p> <p>Meanwhile, that new dock connector was so thoroughly leaked that it's unlikely to put the wind up the burgeoning \"appcessories\" industry (yes, a word used seriously by real companies). As Apple's Phil Schiller noted, a lot of the interesting stuff happening around accessories involves wireless connectivity now, rather than plugs and docks.</p> <p>So yes, nice hardware, but nothing seismic from the point of view of developers in the iPhone 5 itself. It will sell in its tens of millions very quickly, so the business case for supporting its particular specs (screen, processor etc) is clear \u2013&#xa0;something that could also be said of flagship Android handsets like the Samsung Galaxy S III.</p> <p>In truth, the bigger news for app developers tonight was getting a date for the rollout of Apple's iOS 6 software \u2013&#xa0;19 September \u2013&#xa0;which is when we can expect a blizzard of updates taking advantage of the new features in that. Again, no panic: developers have had iOS 6 betas since WWDC earlier in the summer, and the consumer-launch date is as expected.</p> <p>Developers will be zooming out for a wider view of Apple's product family for iOS: the iPhone 4, iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 as the current models on sale, as well as the new iPod touch \u2013&#xa0;all with Retina displays, albeit now at two sizes rather than one.</p> <p>As ever, the fact that older iPhones are dropping in price is meaningful for developers if it brings another influx of upgraders into the iOS ecosystem.</p> <p>There will be legacy models to support too: the old iPod touch remains on sale at a cheaper price, while the iPhone 3GS is seemingly off-sale, but will still get iOS 6. And, of course, there are the three iPad models to consider too \u2013 we'll save the iPad mini discussion for October.</p> <p>In short, iOS will be a bit more fragmented, but sales of the two new devices with the four-inch screens are likely to be high enough to justify the costs of supporting them. Again, not a surprise.</p> <h2>Recommendations improvement</h2> <p>If there was a disappointment for developers tonight, it came in the segment of the presentation that covered iTunes, and specifically the redesigned App Store on iOS devices \u2013&#xa0;more than two thirds of Apple's content downloads happen on these, but since that includes music and films, I'd be willing to bet the percentage is higher for apps specifically.</p> <p>Developers have already had a look at the new App Store in the iOS 6 betas. It's clean and elegant, and the Facebook integration should spur a bit more word-of-mouth buzz.</p> <p>A bit? Well, it relies on people recommending an app at the point of purchase \u2013&#xa0;i.e. before they even download it \u2013&#xa0;or going back in to find its page on the App Store later. Developers integrating Facebook Likes into the apps themselves is more likely to move the needle in this area.</p> <p>The disappointment comes in the silence about how app recommendations startup Chomp's technology is being built into the App Store following its acquisition earlier this year.</p> <p>Apple's senior vice president of internet software and services Eddy Cue referred to \"improved search results\" during his section of the presentation, but from his demonstration, this looked more like Google's autocomplete suggestions than full-on Chomp-style recommendations.</p> <p>To put this another way: app developers knew Apple's iPhone 5 would be an improved version of its predecessor; they knew the on-device App Store was getting a makeover; and they know that all the new iOS devices will sell like hot cakes, thus continuing to expand the potential market for their apps.</p> <p>With 700,000 iOS apps now available in the App Store, though, developers are keen to see what changes Apple has up its sleeves to significantly shake up recommendation and discovery on the store beyond a nicer design. We didn't quite get that today.</p> <p>Even so, iPhone 5 bolsters iOS' position as the first-choice mobile platform for the majority of app developers, not least because Apple continues to do a good job of selling the dream \u2013&#xa0;a theme I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2012/sep/05/lumia-920-windows-phone-apps\">wrote about last week</a> following Nokia's Lumia launch.</p> <p>The dream in this case was epitomised by the two external developers on-stage at the iPhone 5 launch: Rob Murray of EA Studios \u2013&#xa0;formerly of Flight Control and Real Racing developer Firemint until it was acquired \u2013&#xa0;and Torsten Reil of NaturalMotion.</p> <p>Four years ago, Firemint was an unknown indie developer and NaturalMotion was best known for its (console) physics engine technology. Real Racing is now a bona-fide AAA racing franchise, while NaturalMotion made $12m in a single month from its CSR Racing iOS game earlier this year.</p> <p>iPhone 5 is an impressive piece of hardware, but so is the Galaxy S III, Lumia 920 and so on. It's the dream of joining the companies above and other shooting stars in the iOS ecosystem that will linger with app developers.</p>",
  "<p>What are we to make of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/12/chris-stevens-us-ambassador-libya-killed\">murder of the American ambassador and members of his staff in Benghazi</a>? What will be the consequences?</p> <p>The murder of a serving ambassador is deeply shocking, not only for the obvious human reasons, but because it is a blow against the fabric of the international community in which we all live. The immunity that ambassadors enjoy is not simply a matter of duty-free alcohol and avoiding parking fines. It is essential for communication between governments in a world of nation states which are often hostile to each other if not actually at war.</p> <p>There have, of course, always been such murders, and I have myself been close to some of them. In Aden, I lost a colleague and close friend, shot down in the street. Shortly after I left Athens, Britain's defence attach\u00e9 was murdered by Greek terrorists as he drove to the embassy using a route I had used a hundred times myself. When I served as an ambassador, I got used to an armed guard trailing around with me all day. I used to ask myself \"is it really necessary?\" \u2013 in peaceful Luxembourg, for example. But the British ambassador in The Hague had been murdered by the IRA.</p> <p>Most Libyans will be shocked for other reasons, as well. The obligations of hospitality, of which Libyans are acutely conscious, have been flouted. America deserved well of Libya during the overthrow of Gaddafi last year, and US Ambassador Chris Stevens played his part in that. Libyans will blame a small minority of extremists: religious fanatics who have already outraged public opinion (for example, by their desecration of Sufi shrines, the tombs of saints, which are dear to the people).</p> <p>The Libyan government will be acutely embarrassed. Although normal security in Libya is not bad, the Libyan government has yet to take control of the so-called militias, fighters who took up arms during the revolution last year. They are not in revolt against the government; yet, neither does the government enjoy the monopoly of force. Libya has, quite understandably, refused permission for international security companies to operate there, learning the lesson of Iraq. But this means that responsibility for security rests entirely with the state \u2013 and events, particularly the latest events in Benghazi, have shown that they are not yet up to it.</p> <p>The background to the Benghazi murders may be complicated, with several factors at work. Part of the story was popular indignation at an American film insulting Islam and its prophet, which caused <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2012/sep/12/anti-us-protests-libya-egypt\">demonstrations, presumably coordinated, in other Muslim countries, as well</a>. Another part may have been the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/05/al-qaida-abu-yahya-libi\">killing a few months ago of Abu Yahya al-Libi, al-Qaida's Libyan second in command</a>, by the US. His death was announced by al-Qaida on the anniversary of 9/11 with a call for revenge. More generally, there is deep bitterness throughout the Arab and Muslim world against America's actions in Iraq and Afghanistan and over the Palestinian question.</p> <p>What happens next? Everything will depend on the reactions in Libya and the United States. Libya must take robust and effective action, while retaining the democratic standards it has fought so hard to achieve. This could be the testing time: the Libyan people know what has to be done and will respond to decent leadership.</p> <p>The US will have to show restraint, insisting on a proper reaction from Libya, but not overwhelming it with disproportionate force. This would not be easy at any time, but is least of all so now when everything in Washington is done with an eye on electoral politics \u2013 as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2012/sep/12/libya-egypt-attacks-muhammad-film-live?intcmp=239#block-50509c4358f98e4e461a869c\">Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's contemptible knee-jerk reaction</a> makes all too clear.</p> <p>\u2022 Editor's note: A missplaced parenthesis added by an editor implied that Othe author had had an armed guard while he was UK ambassador to Libya in 1984; this was not, in fact, the case, although he did have a bodyguard at other times in his diplomatic career.

  "<p>Will you want to buy one? Like any of the top-end smartphones with which it's competing, such as the Samsung Galaxy SIII and Nokia's forthcoming Lumia 920, buying the top-end version will be a big commitment.</p> <p>Two groups of people will be delighted to snap this up: anyone with an iPhone from before September 2010 (so the iPhone 3G, 3GS, or 4); and anyone who wants to get 4G superfast mobile broadband speeds and is with Orange (aka T-Mobile, aka Everything Everywhere). The first group will be delighted to get a new phone; the second, to get really rapid downloads in citiesThe screen isn't bigger than the Samsung Galaxy SIII, and only a side-by-side comparison with the (as yet unreleased) Nokia Lumia will tell how their camera software matches up.</p> <p>But the iPhone is going to be available later this month \u2014 whereas Nokia hasn't given a date yet.</p> <p>Android users considering a switch will probably enjoy features such as iMessage (the equivalent of BBM, but already bigger because Apple has a larger user base than BlackBerry).</p> <p>And the software that runs iMessage works on every iPhone since 2009. There's nothing as good as the Siri voice control on any other system. And the simplicity of use is something people clearly like. But if you leave Android or BlackBerry, you'll have to abandon your apps \u2014 although the equivalents are almost certain to be available on the Apple App Store. The only difference? You might have to pay for the App Store ones. Android users also like the shortcuts built into the system, which they won't find on the the iPhone.</p> <p>BlackBerry users meanwhile will miss the keyboard \u2014 but they'll like the giant screen. And they'll like and all the apps.The maps software will have to be closely compared against Google's; but the addition of detail on traffic from TomTom means that even though Apple is cutting more its ties to the search giant, the maps look great: during the demonstration Apple showed off an aerial view of Big Ben. Early UK users of the software already say it's great.</p> <p>The new \"lightning\" connector, which makes about a billion existing ones obsolete in a flash, isn't going to ruin your life \u2013 you'll be able to get adaptors.</p> <p>If you don't have a smartphone, the cost will look daunting. (Though the prices of the older iPhones has come down substantially.) Samsung's Galaxy S3 is becoming cheaper, and Nokia may be able to compete \u2014 once we know the prices. But the key difference there is that neither company designs the software that runs the phone. Samsung uses Google's Android; Nokia, Microsoft's Windows Phone. That limits both in subtle ways.Apple offers a walled garden, it's true \u2013 and it's hard to break out once you're inside. Android has the advantage that it offers many different brands, while Windows Phone is borne up almost entirely by Nokia. But with any of these you'll only buy once every couple of years. If the time and the price is right, the iPhone 5 is definitely the most integrated phone out there. <strong> </strong></p>",
  "<p>Brand a view of events a conspiracy, and you lump it in with moon landing denials and wilder accounts of the Roswell UFO incident. But conspiracies can happen in real life too; On Wednesday we learned about one that took place&#xa0;within the South Yorkshire police in 1989. In the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster, which eventually <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/datablog/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-victims-list\" title=\"\">killed 96</a>, officers should have concentrated on learning the lessons to ensure it could never happen again. Instead, it transpires from the forensic work of the <a href=\"http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/repository/report/HIP_report.pdf\" title=\"\">Hillsborough Independent Panel</a>, they looked after their own. In no fewer than&#xa0;116 cases, the police substantially amended their own original written statements before submitting them to the inquiry, in order \"to&#xa0;remove or alter comments unfavourable\"&#xa0;to them.</p> <p>This fixing of the facts has been confirmed, after long years in which bereaved families, dogged campaigners and journalists \u2013 including our own <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidconn\" title=\"\">David Conn</a> \u2013 have picked away at an official take on the tragedy that played down police culpability, and at surrounding slander that implied that Liverpudlian victims had somehow authored their own fate. Certain oddities were always evident, such as the official inquest's seeming undermining of parts of <a href=\"http://www.southyorks.police.uk/sites/default/files/Taylor%20Interim%20Report.pdf\" title=\"\">the Taylor report</a>, and its arbitrary insistence that all fatalities had occurred by 3.15pm. But now that we know that these peculiarities were accompanied by a great cloaking cover-up, the next question is how on earth it was allowed to stand. The answer is: with the connivance of several pillars of an establishment that was \u2013 at that time \u2013 gripped by something approaching the mentality of class war.</p> <p>Four years earlier the South Yorkshire force itself had dabbled in something that was \u2013 in many local communities \u2013 regarded as literal class warfare, during the great miners' strike. With Mrs Thatcher still in Downing Street, the divisive mood of that time lingered on. Football was a more working-class game than it is today, and the Liverpool of the 80s \u2013 the city of Militant, and of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys_from_the_Blackstuff\" title=\"\">Boys from the Blackstuff</a> \u2013 was poor and leftish. On top of that, there had been a genuine issue of violence on the terraces, and memories of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/apr/03/newsstory.sport\" title=\"\">Heysel</a> made it easier than it might have been to taint Liverpool fans with that. The police federation, a local Tory MP \u2013 Irvine Patnick \u2013 and the Sun newspaper were only too eager to do so. They all did their bit to push blame away from the authorities and towards the fans. While the tabloid screamed that \"the truth\" was fans pickpocketing victims and urinating on cops, the real truth was that blood samples of the the dead \u2013 including children \u2013 were taken, and where the victims had alcohol in their blood the police then checked to see if they had criminal records.</p> <p>Although we are fortunate to live in times that are not quite as divisive, this sort of conduct is a reminder of where it can lead when one section of society sneers at another. David Cameron on Wednesday showed the kinder, gentler self he projected in opposition. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/12/david-cameron-hillsborough-report-statement\" title=\"\">a statement</a> that echoed his statesmanlike response to the Saville inquiry, he apologised full-throatedly on behalf of the government, damned the \"denigration of the deceased\", and signalled that the attorney general could look afresh at a new inquest. All sorts of other fallouts would seem to be possibilities \u2013 charges for perverting the course of justice, perhaps, or fresh negligence claims from the vindicated families.</p> <p>The wider lesson, however, is surely \u2013 and once again \u2013 that where blocking out daylight is a possibility, there will be dark motives for seeing that it is done. The contempt and cover-up of Hillsborough might seem like something from even longer ago \u2013 more Life on Mars than The Bill \u2013 but these things could be more easily organised until the Human Rights Act and freedom of information began to change the culture. There is a lesson there, surely, for a government that is bent on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/11/un-official-secret-courts-torture\" title=\"\">pressing on with a new generation of secret courts</a>. That, however, is a matter for another day. Today is a day to remember the dead as well as the injured and the bereaved. The nation sang that they would never walk alone; that is precisely what the self-serving authorities left them to do.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 14 September 2012 because the original incorrectly said, at the end of the third paragraph, \"the real truth was the police probing victims' criminal records and taking blood samples from dead children in the hope of establishing drunkenness\".</p>",
  "<p>My boyfriend at the time had stayed at a mansion called <a href=\"http://www.lilfordhall.com/index.asp\" title=\"\">Lilford Hall in Northamptonshire</a> when he was a student, so in 1970, we went off on a&nbsp;magical mystery tour to rediscover it.&nbsp;The property had been owned by <a href=\"http://www.lilfordhall.com/4th-Baron-Lilford.asp\" title=\"\">Baron Lilford</a>, who kept bears and falcons, and ended up killing himself&nbsp;by jumping from a&nbsp;turret. The&nbsp;place had since been&nbsp;abandoned.</p> <p>We got permission to shoot there and spent a few days working, not staying over but going to and fro.

Surrealism is a wonderful tool to probe the subconscious layers of the feminine psyche, which had not been fully explored at that time.

Our criminal justice system should deliver on its duty by ensuring that these two British citizens, alleged to have committed very serious crimes in the UK, are tried and, if appropriate, imprisoned here. The US's attempt to seek jurisdiction, by dint of the accused's web servers being \"based\" in the US, seems tenuous at best. If this is the extent of the claim to prosecute in the US, then as a result we're all subjected to US law irrespective of our nationality and residence. It is not for the US to deliver universal justice to us all, and such a suggestion should worry us all deeply.</p> <p>I have no sympathy for terrorists. I can also understand why American justice suits the American psyche. But we are not the 51st state of the union; in the UK, we don't vote for American presidents, nor for American poodles. Babar Ahmad and Talha Ahsan are British citizens born and brought up in the UK; they are accused of crimes allegedly committed here.

  "<p>As the president of the anti-slavery organisation <a href=\"http://www.sosesclaves.org/EnglishPages.htm\" title=\"\">SOS-Esclaves</a>, I must respond to Pieter Tesch's assertion that \"there is no slavery in Mauritania\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/06/mauritania-eradicate-hangover-slavery-pieter-tesch\" title=\"\">Comment</a>, 7 September).</p> <p>I have a great deal of experience of slavery in Mauritania. It is not, as suggested, a narrative of western NGOs, despite the attempts of the Mauritanian government to portray it as such. It is a real and common phenomenon, evidenced by the dozens of cases pending before the courts and the fact that a slave-owner was recently prosecuted for the crime. Slavery may have been abolished and is no longer officially legitimised, but it is still widespread.</p> <p>It is certainly difficult to quantify slavery, especially given concerted efforts to deny that the practice exists. With an administration dominated by the slave-owning classes, there is strong opposition to pursuing cases of slavery before the courts; the police and judiciary tend to act in the interests of slave-owners. Indeed, anti-slavery activists are more likely to be imprisoned for their protests than slave-owners are. Furthermore, people in slavery are typically disadvantaged on a social, political, economic and educational level; these circumstances do not make it easy for them to bring cases forward.</p> <p>Slavery practices exist to varying degrees in all ethnic groups in Mauritania, but it is most prevalent among the Moors. Still, there is no question of pitting one ethnic group against another; ours is a struggle against oppression that unites both direct and indirect victims of slavery with people of goodwill from any ethnic background. <br><strong>Boubacar Messaoud</strong><br><em>President, SOS-Esclaves, Nouakchott, Mauritania</em></p>",

These were the words most infamously abused by that headline in the Sun, above <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-disaster-inquest-prosecutions-report\" title=\"\">stories we now know, in extraordinarily shocking detail, were fed by the South Yorkshire police to deflect their own culpability</a> for the disaster on to the innocent victims.</p> <p>Margaret Aspinall, whose son James, then 18, died at what should have been a joyful day out, an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest in spring sunshine, said the families had been forced to fight, for 23 years, for just that: the truth. Aspinall, chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said that although the families' loss would never fade, she was \"delighted\" at the unequivocal, \"profound\" apology given for Hillsborough's savage failings by David Cameron.</p> <p>The Hillsborough Independent Panel, chaired by the bishop of Liverpool, James Jones, had inspected 450,000 documents generated by the police, Sheffield Wednesday and all other bodies responsible, and delivered its remarkable 395-page report indicting official failings and vindicating the victims and football supporters.</p> <p>Some of what happened to cause the disaster, and the police's subsequent blame-shifting, has been exposed over these long decades. But the depth of what the families call a cover-up, in particular the deliberate, relentless South Yorkshire police campaign to avoid its own responsibilities and craft the false case against the supporters, was still startling.</p> <p>In a concerted campaign begun even as the dead were lying in a temporary mortuary at Hillsborough itself \u2013 led, the panel found, by the chief constable, Peter Wright \u2013 the South Yorkshire police marshalled their story that drunken supporters or those without tickets had caused the disaster. The victims, most younger than 30, many of them teenagers, the youngest aged 10, had their blood tested for alcohol levels. This was \"an exceptional decision\", the panel said, for which it found \"no rationale\". One of the new revelations from this extraordinary process, in which all the organisations released to the panel their internal documents relating to Hillsborough, was that where victims had alcohol in their blood, the police then checked to find if they had criminal records.</p> <p>The report, substantially authored by professor Phil Scraton of Queen's University, Belfast, and unanimously agreed by the panel of eight experts, found there was \"no evidence \u2026 to verify the serious allegations of exceptional levels of drunkenness, ticketlessness or violence among Liverpool fans\".</p> <p>The report found that even as the family members, many of them parents stricken with the loss of their children, were plunged into the most dreadful of nightmares, Wright was meeting his police federation in a Sheffield restaurant to prepare \"a defence\" and \"a rock-solid story\". The secretary of the South Yorkshire police federation branch, constable Paul Middup, according to the minutes cited by the panel, told the restaurant meeting before Wright turned up: \"The chief constable had said the truth could not come from him, but had given the secretary a totally free hand and supported him,\" as had many senior officers.</p> <p>The meeting, at the Pickwick restaurant in Sheffield, was held on the morning of 19 April 1989, just four days after the disaster. It was the day that Kelvin MacKenzie's Sun newspaper splashed its headline \"The Truth\" over lies fed to it, via Whites Press agency, by, the panel found, four senior South Yorkshire police officers. Middup was encouraged to continue this police campaign of defaming Liverpool supporters for supposed drunkenness and misbehaviour and \"to get the message \u2013 togetherness \u2013 across to the force\".</p> <p>The panel's report sustained the allegation made in parliament \u2013 by the Labour Merseyside MP Maria Eagle \u2013 that the orchestrated changing of junior officers' statements by senior South Yorkshire police officers amounted to a \"black propaganda unit\".</p> <p>The officers' statements, presented as official police accounts to the subsequent inquiry by Lord Justice Taylor, were changed to delete criticism of the police themselves on the day, and, largely, emphasise misbehaviour by supporters. The panel found that the operation went as deep and extensive as 116 of 164 statements being amended \"to remove or alter comments unfavourable to South Yorkshire police\".</p> <p>The police had claimed this was done only to remove \"conjecture\" and \"opinion\" from the statements, but the panel had no doubt the operation, to craft a case rather than deliver truthful police accounts, went further.</p> <p>\"It was done to remove criticism of the police,\" Scraton said.</p> <p>This propaganda, generated as family members wept in houses with suddenly empty bedrooms, did not convince Taylor. He ruled as quickly as August 1989 that the police stories of fan drunkenness and misbehaviour were false, and criticised the police for advancing the claims. Taylor exposed that Sheffield Wednesday's football ground was unsafe in crucial respects, that the Football Association had selected it as the venue for its prestigious match without even checking if Hillsborough had a valid safety certificate, which it did not.</p> <p>In that landscape of neglect, it was the mismanagement of the crowd by South Yorkshire police, commanded by an inexperienced Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield, which was \"the prime cause\" of the disaster. The police lost control outside the ground, where 24,000 Liverpool fans had to be funnelled through just 23 turnstiles, so Duckenfield ordered a large exit gate to be opened and a large number of people to be allowed in. His \"blunder of the first magnitude\", according to Taylor, was the failure to close off the tunnel that led to the already overcrowded central \"pens\" \u2013 a dreadful word for a sports venue \u2013 of the Leppings Lane terrace.</p> <p>That much was established by the Taylor report, yet the police, undaunted, repeated their claims to the subsequent inquest. Its procedure was marked by the coroner's decision not to take evidence of what happened after 3.15pm on the day of the disaster, thereby excluding an emergency response the panel found to have been chaotic. The finding that 41 of the 96 who died could possibly have been saved had the police and ambulance service done their jobs decently is damning of those bodies and, Aspinall said, difficult for the families to contemplate.</p> <p>The attorney general, Dominic Grieve, is now, in the light of the panel's report, to consider whether to make an application to the high court for the inquest verdict of accidental death to be quashed and a new inquest held.</p> <p>There may be prosecutions too, after all these years, of Sheffield Wednesday, South Yorkshire police and Sheffield city council, which failed in its duty to oversee safety of the football ground. Trevor Hicks, the president of the HFSG, both of whose teenage daughters, Sarah and Victoria, died in the Leppings Lane crush, said they will pursue all legal redress: \"The truth is out today,\" Hicks said. \"Tomorrow is for justice.\"</p> <p>Aspinall said she felt a profound sense of outrage and injustice at the campaign she and other families have been forced to fight, especially as the real truth was known to authorities all along.</p> <p>\"What the families have been put through for 23 years was a disgrace, to put the families through this much pain.\" She complained that while the families had to find the money to pay their own costs through years of legal processes, the South Yorkshire police force, individual officers and other public bodies had theirs paid by the taxpayer.</p> <p>\"Yet,\" she said, \"they were liars and we were the truthful ones.\"</p> <p>Jones, sitting calmly in the cathedral from which he performs his duties to the diocese of Liverpool, said that as a pastor he was \"committed to a just and fair world\". He added: \"That goes to the heart of our work as a panel: we are looking for truth, and justice.\"</p> <p>And there was that word again. After so many years, so much pain, so long and terrible a battle waged by families who would not give up for their loved ones, it has been finally reclaimed. The truth.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 14 September 2012 because it incorrectly said \"where victims had no alcohol in their blood, the police then checked to find if they had criminal records\".</p>",
  "<p>Investigators attempting to piece together why a British family was murdered in the French Alps last week say they are now pursuing three main leads, as relatives who said they were heartbroken called for whoever carried out the brutal killings to be brought to justice.</p> <p>A week after the bullet-ridden bodies of Surrey-based engineer Saad al-Hilli, his wife Iqbal and her mother Suhaila al-Allaf were found in a car near Lake Annecy, with a passing cyclist also shot dead nearby, prosecutor Eric Maillaud said the investigation was focusing on three factors: an alleged family dispute, Saad al-Hilli's profession as a contractor for a satellite technology company in Surrey, and his origins in Iraq.</p> <p>Key witness testimony from the couple's seven-year-old daughter, Zainab, who was shot and badly beaten during the attack, has yet to be heard. Investigators waiting to question her have yet to be given the go ahead by doctors, said Maillaud, who said she remained in a \"delicate\" state of health after being brought out of a medically induced coma at the hospital in Grenoble where she is under armed guard.</p> <p>Her four-year-old sister, Zeena, who survived the attack physically unscathed by hiding under her mother's legs, has returned home to Britain.</p> <p>In their first public statement since the killings last Wednesday, relatives called on investigators to move quickly in their hunt. In a statement issued by the Foreign Office, Ahmed Al-Saffar, brother of the 74-year-old Swedish-Iraqi Suhaila al-Allaf, said: \"The victim's family and I are heartbroken by this shocking crime and we have been touched by the expressions of sympathy from people all over the world ... We are very grateful for the support provided by the British, French and Iraqi authorities during this difficult time. We hope that those responsible for the deaths of our loved ones are brought swiftly to justice.\"</p> <p>Maillaud and one of the two investigating judges responsible for the case are due to visit the UK on Thursday in order, he said, to \"further develop and strengthen the quality of co-operation\" between the investigators in the two countries. He will visit the Hillis' mock-Tudor home in Claygate, Surrey, and meet police officers and officials from the Crown Prosecution Service.</p> <p>He said that both sides had been trying to work together and understand each other, but the language barrier and legal system differences had presented difficulties. \"I think the British police would say the same,\" he told a press conference in Annecy. \"We can say that basically we exist in the same western universe and that we are very close, that we share the same things, but we have different legal systems and there are sometimes difficulties in understanding which slow down and we all regret that.\"</p> <p>He said a large part of the investigation was taking place in Britain where French authorities believe a \"great number of clues\" could be found. However, he cautioned that a case of this scale \u2013 it now stretches across four countries \u2013 could take years to solve.</p> <p>Much attention has focused on the family and an alleged financial feud between 50-year-old Saad and his brother Zaid, who is also based in the UK. However, Zaid al-Hilli is understood to have approached British police officers to deny the reports, and Maillaud said the \"familial lead\" was no more deserving of interest than Hilli's job or his family roots.</p> <p>\"The fact that he was born in Iraq, that he had family in Iraq, of course that's something that is of interest and we are asking ourselves if there is a link between that and his death,\" Maillaud said. That line of investigation was being pursued by \"people who know who to contact in order to be able to work with that country so, for example, we have a security attache we are working with\". There was a great difficulty in obtaining reliable information from Iraq, he said.</p> <p>One of the original theories behind the killings of the three family members \u2013 who were found dead in their maroon BMW to the side of a<br>road leading through the Combe d'Ire forest near Chevaline \u2013 and<br>Sylvain Mollier, a French cyclist murdered alongside them, was that of<br>robbery. However, without saying that any lead had been discarded, Maillaud said numerous identification documents had been left in the car after the attack.</p> <p>He would give no further information concerning the weapon used, believed to be a 7.65 calibre pistol, saying he deplored the leaks that had surfaced in the media surrounding the nature of the weapon and number of perpetrators.</p> <p>He also refused to comment on remarks reportedly made by police that the family did not appear to have the profile of \"ordinary tourists\".</p> <p>In separate reports, fellow campers have told the media that Saad al-Hilli had behaved \"strangely\" in the days leading up to the attack.</p> <p>Maillaud said the bodies of all four people killed in the attack had now been returned to their families.</p>",
  "<p>The attack on the US consulate in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi came after midnight in a blaze of gunfire and grenade explosions, taking the diplomats inside by surprise.</p> <p>The consulate IT expert, Sean Smith, was chatting online to fellow internet gamers when it happened. According to another player, who goes by the online handle of <a href=\"http://themittani.com/news/rip-vile-rat\" title=\"\">The_Mittani</a>, Smith \"said 'fuck' and 'gunfire' and then disconnected and never returned\".</p> <p>Smith was one of four Americans killed in the Benghazi attack along with the ambassador, Chris Stevens, and two bodyguards who have not yet been named, presumably because they were members of US special forces. <a href=\"http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/12/new-details-on-benghazi-attack/\" title=\"\">CNN</a> quoted a senior US official as saying the four became separated from their colleagues trying to escape to the roof, where they succumbed to smoke inhalation.</p> <p>A photograph taken in the chaos outside showed Stevens being carried, apparently unconscious, by a crowd of Libyans. He was taken to a Benghazi hospital where a doctor, Ziad Abu Zeid, initially had no idea who the emergency patient was. The doctor told Associated Press that Stevens had \"severe asphyxia\", apparently from smoke inhalation, causing stomach bleeding, but had no other injuries. The doctor tried for 90 minutes to revive him but to no avail.</p> <p>Stevens was only the sixth American ambassador to be killed in the line of duty in the country's history. His killing is likely to have far-reaching consequences in American attitudes towards the Arab spring, and could become a factor in the US presidential elections.</p> <p>It was the culmination of a day of rage in north Africa ostensibly triggered by a previously obscure, rabidly anti-Islamic film made a year earlier in the US. Demonstrators stormed the US embassy compound in Cairo, climbing over the outer wall, taking down the flag and daubing the buildings with Islamic slogans. There were suggestions by unnamed senior US officials that the attack in Benghazi had been planned by an extremist group using outrage at the film as a diversion. But it seems likely the anger generated by the movie provided both the occasion and pretext for the lethal assault.</p> <p>According to al-Jazeera's correspondent in Benghazi, Suleiman Idrissi, \"at about 11.30pm a group of people calling themselves Islamic law [Sharia] supporters heard there would be an American movie insulting the prophet Muhammad. Once they heard this news they came out of their military garrison, and went into the streets calling on people to go ahead and attack the American consulate in Benghazi.\"</p> <p>The long fuse that led to the explosion of violence that ultimately killed Stevens was lit last summer in California, where someone calling himself Sam Bacile set about making what is likely to be remembered as one of the most notorious films in recent history. It is far from clear who Bacile is. He described himself in telephone interviews this week with the <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444017504577645681057498266.html\" title=\"\">Wall Street Journal</a> and AP as an Israeli-American property developer, but neither the Israeli authorities nor the California realtors association had heard his name.</p> <p>In July, a clip from Bacile's film, called Innocence of Muslims, a bizarre and amateurish attack on the prophet Muhammad, appeared on the internet. The subject is religion but the style, production values and acting are reminiscent of gonzo, low-budget porn, a vast industry in southern California, where this movie seems to have been made. Rarely has the porn industry produced anything as intentionally offensive as the Bacile film.</p> <p>Steve Klein, a militant Christian activist credited as a consultant on the film, told The Atlantic online: \"He's not Israeli \u2026 His name is a pseudonym. All these Middle Eastern folks I work with have pseudonyms. I doubt he's Jewish. I would suspect this is a disinformation campaign.\"</p> <p>The man calling himself Bacile said he had raised a budget of $5m from 100 \"Jewish donors\", whom he declined to name, to make the film, which he wrote and directed himself with the aim of demonstrating his belief, as he described it to the Wall Street Journal, that \"Islam is a cancer\".</p> <p>To that end, Bacile got his amateur cast to depict the prophet Muhammad as a feckless philanderer who approved of child abuse. It took three months, 59 actors and about 45 crew. The result was two hours of stumbling dialogue and wooden acting among flimsy sets, and a stream of gratuitous insults aimed at Muslims. It was screened in an almost empty cinema in Hollywood earlier this year. In another age, that would probably have been the end of the story. In the YouTube era, however, it was a bomb primed for detonation.</p> <p>Bacile posted a 13-minute English-language trailer on YouTube in early July but it was only in the past week that it appears to have caught on of the online sectarian culture wars.</p> <p>A Florida pastor, Terry Jones, who had triggered protests in the Islamic world for burning the Qur'an and his campaign to stop the construction of a mosque at the site of the 9/11 attacks, promoted the film on his website and announced his intention to broadcast the trailer at his Gainesville church this week.</p> <p>The film clip was also promoted last week by Morris Sadik, the Egyptian Coptic Christian also based in California, who runs a small, virulently Islamophobic group called the National American Coptic Assembly. It was later denounced by mainstream Copts in Egypt, but it was too late to stop it going viral.</p> <p>At some point over the summer, a version of the YouTube trailer surfaced with the dialogue dubbed in Egyptian Arabic and the translated clip was picked up by a firebrand Cairo television host, Sheikh Khaled Abdallah, with a record of focusing on perceived threats to Islam. He aired clips from the video on his television show on Saturday, and the same video clips were posted to YouTube on Monday.</p> <p>As the audience for Innocence of Muslims grew exponentially, militant Islamists called for a mass protest at the US embassy in Cairo. The organisers said they began planning it last week when Sadik began promoting the trailers, but support for the demonstration snowballed after the Sheikh Abdallah programme.</p> <p>A crowd of some 2,000 is reported to have gathered outside the embassy walls in Cairo on Tuesday. The security services appear to have been caught flat-footed even though the protest had been announced. Most of the diplomats and local staff had left early and a few dozen of the demonstrators were able to scale a wall, take down the stars and stripes and replace it with a black flag. The Egyptian police only managed to evict them in the late evening.</p> <p>By that time, however, the spark had jumped westwards to the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi. According to al-Jazeera, an extremist militia called Ansar al-Sharia, one of many such armed groups staking out fiefdoms in Libya in the aftermath of Muammar Gaddafi's fall, heard about the storming of the Cairo embassy and the American film.</p> <p>Stevens had the misfortune to be making a short visit to Benghazi, and, according to US officials quoted on Wednesday, was probably not the intended target.</p> <p>Bacile, whoever he is, was reported to have gone into hiding on Wednesday night. He spoke to AP from an undisclosed location, said he had not expected such a furious reaction, and criticised security at US diplomatic outposts. \"I feel sorry for the embassy. I am mad,\" he said. But Bacile insisted that the movie would help Israel by exposing what he described as Islam's flaws to the world.</p> <p>\"My plan is to make a series of 200 hours,\" he claimed.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Wartime Farm</strong><br>8pm, BBC2<br></h2> <p>Wartime lifestyle porn as Ruth, Alex and Peter try to make ends meet in a world where imported food is scarce. Manor Farm is a hive of activity this week. Ruth recruits a Pig Club and gets cracking on a lovely swill, as well as picking up tips on how to steal petrol. Alex and Peter are occupied with silage, but disaster strikes when they realise the cows have enjoyed a premature munch on their sugar beets. Meanwhile, the ladies of the Hampshire WI get busy with the preserves. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>Screenwriters \u2013 The Bafta And BFI Lectures<br>8pm, Sky Arts1</h2> <p>The last in this series of masterclass lectures from prominent writers from film and TV may well be the best of the lot, featuring an insight into the inner workings of the inimitable Charlie Kaufman, the mind behind such knotty greats as Adaptation and Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. Kaufman argues here that a production-line culture in Hollywood has stunted the creative output of many of his peers, and calls for a shift towards original screenwriters. Easier said than done, one fears, but a fine sentiment nonetheless. <em>Gwilym Mumford</em></p> <h2><strong>Good Cop</strong><br>9pm, BBC1<br></h2> <p>This is a drama with the premise of a bad US cop movie, but which has been cast and played like the best kind of UK drama. Warren Brown continues to do a great job as John-Paul, a slightly anonymous-looking Liverpool policeman whose vigilante actions to avenge his murdered co-worker are beginning to give him a few worries. It's a tense drama, that finds John-Paul not so much losing the plot as pursuing tangential storylines \u2013 none of which are particularly well-advised. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2><strong>The Audience</strong><br>9pm, Channel 4<br></h2> <p>On paper the concept for this new series is nuts. One person who faces a life-changing decision is literally followed around by 50 people for a week as they go about their lives. The audience observe, ask questions and meet people involved in the dilemma, before coming to a conclusion as to what should be done. As TV it works remarkably well, as people's different opinions are brought to bear, though the filmmakers are skilful in carving a narrative and know exactly what to do with the emotional capital generated. First up is dairy farmer Ian Wainwright, who must decide whether to stay at his family's farm or to start a new life. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p> <h2><strong>The InterCity 125: The&#xa0;Age Of The Train </strong><br>9pm, BBC4<br></h2> <p>Perhaps best-known due to Jimmy Savile's long-running ad campaign, or for inspiring one of Ben \"Double Seat\" Elton's most memorable routines, the InterCity 125 was introduced by British Rail in 1976 with the aim of revitalising its commercial fortunes and to make travelling by train a more appealing experience for the public.

Or at least, tones it down to the point where phrases like \"Check it out!\" and \"Quantum physics \u2013 I told you it was weird!\" become commonplace. It's unnerving initially, but at least underlines the fact that this science gubbins is supposed to be fun. In this first episode, Hawking covers everything from gravity to the finely named luminiferous aether, while asking \"What is this universe stuff anyway?\" <em>Ali Catterall</em></p>",
  "<p>All hail Borisconi \u2013 formerly known as Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson and the political Mo Farah of the Olympics. Bojo is still keeping it real, sometimes too real. Don't mention the affairs or the Spectator editorial about Hillsborough that he had a hand in. The man with his finger on the national pulse once thought it was OK to pontificate on the wallowing in self-pity of Liverpudlians. Water under the bridge now, as fireworks and flags are everywhere. Such is Boris's appeal that should he be caught at a bunga bunga party it would be written off as Prince Harry-style exuberance.</p> <p>The psyche of Boris may appear as unruly as his hair but his timing is razor-sharp. The victory parade turned into a Boris rally with Cameron looking timid next to him. He bashed the French and cracked some great jokes. What more do you want? Please don't say substance. Boris's style is substantial enough to have made him the most recognisable and popular politician in the land. While he often seemed bored during his own mayoral campaign, he has, as they say, \"owned\" these Olympics.</p> <p>The polls now register his charisma, hence much over-excited premature speculation. He is not yet PM, not even an MP. When he was, he was fairly lacklustre. Nor does he appeal so much to those weird minorities the Tories need to win power: women, northerners, the upper-working classes. A quick trip past Luton pricks the Boris bubble. Yet his ability to embody hope, cheer and pride over the summer has been indeed phenomenal. While Osborne was booed and Ed Miliband took himself to Greece to think deep thoughts, Boris invited Murdoch as his special guest. Murdoch bumped into Jeremy Hunt near the aquatics. We were told they had a chat about swimming. Yes, and I am faster than Usain Bolt. Murdoch likes to associate himself with winners, as we know. And the media tentacles spread. Boris now employs his ex-champion, former Evening Standard editor Veronica Wadley. Still, you wouldn't want Wadley's husband Tom Bower doing one of his donkey-punch biographies, would you?</p> <p>Undoubtedly Boris is brilliant and funny and clever. Before he was so powerful he would liven up many a boring debate on the euro with the admission that he had gone into a deep trance. Detail is not his forte; the big picture, the grand symbolic gesture, is. His outbursts of honesty hide his imperial attitude. They hide his utter ruthlessness and the fact that he a politician, not a gameshow panellist.</p> <p>His record shows that he is not above betraying people he has worked for, in one way or another. He promised more than he can deliver. He did not deliver the Olympics but is sucking up vast amounts of credit for them. His hack trick&#xa0;of&#xa0;winging it has come into its own. The level at which he needs to be in control is frightening and that control combined with his intellect is what makes him a superb writer. The clownishness masks the absolute need to win. Once he got me into a party. Some Tory do, not his party, let me make that clear, and he said I&#xa0;could stay for 20 minutes. I was happily chatting as I knew many people there when he whispered after exactly 20 minutes: \"Your time is up.\" That's bonhomie for you.</p> <p>Petty but telling, I felt, and not in the least shambolic. If you don't know his core of steel then rewind the tape of the conversation he had&#xa0;with self-confessed \"potential psychopath\"&#xa0;Darius Guppy. Guppy is after a telephone number for someone who has too much information on him. \"If this guy is seriously hurt, I am going to be fucking furious,\" says Boris. Guppy reassures him it won't be \"intensive care\". Just cracked ribs. Nice.</p> <p>This man's lifestyle is hardly the stuff of Tory \"family values\" but what does Boris think of abortion and single parents? Is such fecklessness fine if you can afford it? He once supported Section 28. Since then, he has been at Pride marches. He will do what it takes. He has bashed the bankers. And he wants an island with an airport on it. What his values are is hard to say. His achievements as mayor have been rather like the bikes: unwieldy, expensive, not his own idea, but heavily branded as if they were.</p> <p>The idea of him as party leader is terrifying even to many in his own party. The laissez-faire chaotic individuality is superficially attractive but what does he want power for? To simply scoop up adulation and the daft women who throw themselves at him? His rise is the product of a deeply anti-politics mood that&#xa0;looks appealingly different but is not&#xa0;as&#xa0;transgressive at it appears. He is able&#xa0;to summon up the \"national\" mood, work the media and make us feel good. But&#xa0;do not mistake this laughter for freedom. He is no&#xa0;libertarian but someone with an actual lust for authority. Hilarious, if you actually want a Borisconi in charge. Not so funny if you don't.</p>",
  "<p>Immediately after his 10,000m triumph, Mo Farah <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcXjzP5oFwQ\" title=\"\">was asked by the BBC's trackside reporter</a> what it takes to win gold. \"It's the grafting and hard work,\" he said, \"120 miles, week in, week out \u2013 long distance is a lonely event.\"</p> <p>Consciously or not, Farah was echoing a phrase that first drifted into the mind of writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/apr/25/alan-sillitoe-obituary\" title=\"\">Alan Sillitoe</a> one chilly November morning in 1959. Before his death in 2010, Sillitoe recalled: \"I was staring out of the window when this figure wearing shorts and vest came jogging past. I wrote at the top of the page: The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner. I didn't know what it meant. I&nbsp;thought I might write a poem.\"</p> <p>What came out wasn't a poem but a piece of short fiction unlike any other: a torrent of uncensored prose expressing the thoughts of Colin Smith, a 17-year-old borstal boy with a talent for running. \"If I had the whip hand,\" Colin says, \"I'd take all the cops, governors, pen-pushers, army officers, Members of Parliament, stick them up against a wall and let them have it, like they'd have done with blokes like us.\"</p> <p>For many, the image of Sillitoe's runner is indelibly associated with Tom Courtenay, pounding through the bleak yet beautifully framed landscapes of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXMS5ZXKvYA\" title=\"\">Tony Richardson's classic film</a>. One of the landmark achievements of <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/445176/index.html\" title=\"\">the British New Wave</a>, the film is 50 this year. But Sillitoe's proletarian parable shows no signs of ageing: playwright <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/jun/07/roy-williams-sucker-punch-interview\" title=\"\">Roy Williams</a> has now created a stage version, updating the action to the&nbsp;aftermath of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/06/tottenham-riots-protesters-police\" title=\"\">last year's Tottenham&nbsp;riots&nbsp;in London</a>.</p> <p>In Sillitoe's book, Colin is sent down for robbing a bakery. Williams's adaptation, presented by <a href=\"http://www.pilot-theatre.com/\" title=\"\">Pilot Theatre</a>, finds him convicted for looting a Greggs. This is not Williams' first foray into sport and social disturbances: his 2010 drama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/jun/20/sucker-punch-theatre-review\" title=\"\">Sucker Punch</a> set the rivalry between two north London boxers against the background of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/07/tottenham-riot-broadwater-farm\" title=\"\">the 1985 riots on the Broadwater Farm estate</a>. \"I was actually quite wary of focusing on the riots, or even young people again,\" Williams says. \"But then when everything erupted, I felt I&nbsp;had to respond.\"</p> <p>Sillitoe's story seemed the perfect vehicle: the famously ambiguous conclusion (in which Colin deliberately loses the race) leaves it up to the reader to decide whether this is an act of rebellion against the established order, or a capitulation. \"It was precisely how I felt when I saw the TV images of young people going out on a looting spree,\" Williams says. \"I've almost exclusively made that generation the subject of my plays, and seeing them behave like that brought tears to my eyes. I mean, I love&nbsp;them, and I want to fight for them,&nbsp;but I also feel the urge to slap them sometimes.\"</p> <p>Williams has not made any major revisions to the story, but adapted some of the dialogue and brought the references up to date. He has, however, made one significant alteration. In Sillitoe's story, Colin is white; in Williams's version, he is black. Does he think this will influence the audience's perception of the character? \"I don't think it alters it at all,\" Williams counters. \"It just seemed right. That's partly down to my own inclination to see young, strong, black characters on stage. But it is a play about a race, rather than a 'race play'.\"</p> <p>The alterations were made with the consent of Sillitoe's widow, Ruth, who oversees the writer's estate. Tom Courtenay also accepts that certain aspects of the story may be due for revision. \"A friend pointed out recently that a young offender's institution would certainly not be exclusively Anglo-Saxon, and maybe not quite so much like a public school,\" he says.</p> <p>Courtenay came from a working-class background in Hull and was freshly out of drama school when Richardson cast him. \"Tom was perfect,\" Sillitoe said. \"I actually felt Tom was closer to my image of Colin than Albert Finney had been as Arthur in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6gY5a8n1Hg\" title=\"\">Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</a>. He had that lean, hungry, aware look.\" Yet despite having given the definitive performance, Courtenay claims not to have had much in common with the character. \"I couldn't empathise with him much at all. His working-class upbringing I could identify with \u2013 but I didn't share his rebelliousness or his hatred of society. It was the romantic side of his character that appealed to me \u2013 the way he uses his talent as a means of escape. I really wasn't an angry young man at all.\"</p> <p>The film was shot entirely on location, in quasi-documentary style, with a minimum of takes. Richardson used borstal inmates as extras, but could not gain permission to film in a real remand home: <a href=\"http://surrey.greatbritishlife.co.uk/article/ruxley-towers-claygate--historic-surrey-homes-10042/\" title=\"\">Ruxley Towers</a>, a&nbsp;Victorian mock-castle in Surrey, had to substitute. \"I still see the tower all the time, driving past,\" Courtenay says. \"It gives me the shivers.\"</p> <p>Richardson's portrayal of a young offenders' institution now seems mild in comparison with films such as <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079871/\" title=\"\">Alan Clarke's Scum</a>; at the time, it revealed a shocking level of brutality and privation that came as a shock to contemporary cinema audiences. The film's sustained attack on the political establishment upset the censors: one report described the film as \"blatant and very trying communist propaganda\". But it also remains remarkable for its technical innovation:&nbsp;Richardson's use of hand-held cameras and improvisation was ahead of its time \u2013 though Courtenay points out that the low budget left its mark. \"If you look at the scenes in which I'm running, sometimes I'm wearing socks and at other times I'm not,\" he says. \"That was because they put in some of the earlier test footage, which they didn't have to pay me for.\"</p> <p>Courtenay's haphazard running style \u2013 all fierce facial contortions and flailing arms \u2013 might best be described as untutored. \"Time magazine wrote that I had studied <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6--kiYKx9kA\" title=\"\">[runner Emil] Z\u00e1topek</a>,\" Courtenay laughs. \"But I&nbsp;wasn't an athlete at all.

While the film required Sillitoe to pad out his original story with additional scenes and characters, Williams' script unfolds in real time, over the course of the race. The set features an 8m treadmill (the only one of its kind in the country), on which Barnes-Worrell will be required to run for approximately half the show. \"That's averaging out as the equivalent of 5km per night,\" he says, \"so I get a genuine sweat on.\"</p> <p>Fortunately, Barnes-Worrell, who is making his professional debut, happens to be a member of the alternative London running club, <a href=\"http://www.rundemcrew.com/about\" title=\"\">Run Dem Crew</a>. \"It started as a group who were looking for the camaraderie of a running club without all the cliques and Lycra,\" he says. Throughout his time at drama school, Barnes-Worrell ran 10km, four times a week. \"But I had to leave the crew in order to prepare for this part,\" he says. \"Running solo is&nbsp;very different.

  "<p>Peter Cummings, the HBOS banker whose division lent billions of pounds to property developers, has been given a lifetime ban by the Financial Services Authority for his role in the banking crisis.</p> <p>Cummings, who has also been fined \u00a3500,000, is the only former HBOS banker to be penalised by the City regulator as a result of the near-collapse of the bank which was rescued by Lloyds in September 2008 - and the highest profile banker to be punished since the financial crisis.</p> <p>The 57-year old Scottish banker launched a stinging attack on the regulator for not taking action against any of his former colleagues at the bank which eventually needed a \u00a320bn taxpayer bail out.</p> <p>Calling for an independent report into the HBOS collapse, Cummings, who retired with a \u00a3352,000 a year pension, said: \"This is tokenism at its most sinister, and has made it feel throughout like institutional oppression\".</p> <p>The action against the retired banker, well known as a lender to Top Shop founder Sir Philip Green and other high profile business executives, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/09/bank-of-scotland-fsa-serious-misconduct\" title=\"\">follows the announcement by the FSA in March</a> that the Bank of Scotland corporate division of HBOS which had run and which was found guilty of \"very serious misconduct\".</p> <p>The FSA said it would begin work on finding out what went wrong at the bank - created in 2001 through the merger of Halifax and Bank of Scotland - and publish a report before it is disbanded in March next year.</p> <p>Cummings, who retired in January 2009 following the Lloyds rescue after a career <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/11/peter-cummings-hbos\" title=\"\">that began at Bank of Scotland when he was just 18,</a> was found to have failed to \"exercise due skill, care and diligence\" in running the corporate banking division and failed to manage \"high value transactions\" as they showed signed of stress as the banking crisis took hold.</p> <p>A softly spoken Glaswegian, Cummings' first job was said to be making tea in his local Dumbarton branch. It was not until January 2006 that he was promoted to main board level when Sir James Crosby was still chief executive of HBOS. Crosby handed the helm to Andy Hornby, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jul/18/andy-hornby-new-boss-coral\" title=\"\">now boss of Coral</a>, in July 2006 while Lord Stevenson was chairman of the bank during the period.</p> <p>Bank of Scotland corporate division became well known as a lender to property companies but also taking equity stakes in companies such as retirement-home builder McCarthy &amp; Stone, and housebuilder Crest Nicholson. It helped fund Green's ill-fated tilt at Marks &amp; Spencer in 2004.</p> <p>The division kept expanding in the months running up to the financial crisis, even as rivals were pulling back - and the FSA, <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/static/pubs/final/peter-cummings.pdf\" title=\"\">in a 92-page final notice</a>, argued that Cummings should have restrained the business which operated \"with a culture of optimism\" with bonuses linked to sales. The investigation covered the three years starting in early 2006 and ended in December 2008, just as Lloyds was taking control of HBOS. Shortly afterwards, in February 2009, the enlarged bank, known as Lloyds Banking Group and 40% owned by the taxpayer, was forced to increase the level of bad debt provision to \u00a37bn from \u00a33.3bn in December because HBOS had taken an \"optimistic\" approach to provisioning.</p> <p>In March, the regulator said it did not fine HBOS because the bill would have been picked up the taxpayer.</p> <p>Explaining he was not taking the FSA to a tribunal because of the cost and impact on his family, Cummings said: \"Many people must bear collective responsibility for what happened, including governments and regulators as well as the boards of the banks themselves. But the fact that I am the only individual from HBOS to face investigation defies comprehension\". The FSA said it had taken into account the fact had waived a \u00a31.3m bonus when he left.</p> <p>There has been speculation that Cummings had originally faced a \u00a31m fine from the FSA which has been under fire for its handling of the financial crisis.</p> <p>It closed its investigation in to what went wrong at Royal Bank of Scotland <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2011/dec/12/royal-bank-of-scotland-fsa-report\" title=\"\">without taking action against Fred Goodwin</a>, the former chief executive who has since been stripped of his knighthood. Johnny Cameron, the former head of investment banking at RBS, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/may/18/rbs-boss-cameron-never-take-bank-job\" title=\"\">agreed not to work in the City again</a> although no regulatory action was taken against him.</p> <h2>Rise in bad debts</h2> <p>Peter Cummings, the former boss of the Bank of Scotland corporate division inside HBOS, was found by the FSA to have a led a \"culture of optimism\" which led to the bank being slow to notice a rise in bad debts.</p> <p>While the FSA admitted that some of the problems existed before Cummings took over and other directors shared responsibility, it said the bank allowed too many big loans to a small number of borrowers and that the full extent of the bad debts inside the corporate division were not immediately clear to the board, its auditors or regulators.</p> <p>The FSA noted that the corporate division took on risk by taking on 100% exposure to loans which it then sold down rather than trying to join in a club with other banks to reduce the risk.</p>",

The greyed and blotched photographs are startling things. They have been seen as premonitions of Afghanistan's looming war with the Russian bear, but like much of Polke's work, their meaning remains elusive. This is surely part of Polke's point (he was probably a tad unhinged when he made these, while on his drug-addled Grand Tour, and the images evince a kind of muzzy, stoned paranoia). The way they deal with danger and violence could not be more unlike British photojournalist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2003/jan/18/highereducation.news\" title=\"\">Larry Burrows</a>' large-scale and filmic scenes from Cambodia and the Vietnam war.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396062689\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/9/12/1347472784339/Boris-Mikhailov--008.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Mikhailov \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A work by Boris Mikhailov.

I, for one, have never worried too much about such things. Going from William Eggleston's photographs to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2011/apr/24/bruce-davidson-interview-sean-ohagan\" title=\"\">Bruce Davidson</a>'s of the civil rights era, you ask what the link might be. Perhaps what Eggleston photographs, intuitively and beautifully, is a kind of southern mindset and emotional tenor; a sort of deep background to the situations Davidson records. But the comparisons don't tell us very much, nor do the differences between approaches and subjects.</p> <p>Everything Was Moving is better as a book than a show, and better taken as a series of solo exhibitions \u2013 most of which don't go deep enough. There is an enormous gulf, say, between Burrows (who died in Laos in 1971) and the black-and-white portraits by the wonderful <a href=\"http://www.mocp.org/collections/permanent/iturbide_graciela.php\" title=\"\">Graciela Iturbide</a>; a total change of register and intent. Burrows' photograph of a US soldier crying in shock, and Iturbide's portrait of Our Lady of the Iguanas, a proud woman whose head is covered by live reptiles, are worlds apart. For me, Iturbide is one of the discoveries of this show.</p> <p>Is there a connection between a jukebox on a wall in Los Alamos, shot by Eggleston, and a soldier's helmet to which the skull has fused, in a photograph by Tomatsu? If there is, it has nothing to do with photography, though it might have something to do with Los Alamos, where the atomic bomb was developed, and Nagasaki, where it was dropped. We scuttle back and forth, in time and space.</p>",

This performance is continuing to improve.</p> <p>\"We acknowledge that, as with the old system, there have been challenges.

  "<p>Angela Merkel said Germany's highest court had sent a powerful message to the rest of Europe and beyond, after it paved the way for the creation of a \u20ac500bn rescue fund to tackle the eurozone's debt crisis.</p> <p>Markets rallied following the decision by the eight justices of the constitutional court in Karlsruhe to let Germany ratify a treaty to establish the European stability mechanism (ESM). The euro reached a four-month high and European stock markets rose after the court imposed conditions that were less burdensome than German parliamentarians and other ESM supporters had feared.</p> <p>The ESM can now start up next month and become fully operational by the new year, despite the warnings of analysts who say it will not work. The ruling was considered one of the most important in the court's 61-year history.</p> <p>A key condition attached to the ruling means that Germany's liabilities will be capped at \u20ac190bn. But the fact that the Bundestag and Germany's ESM representative can override the limitation led some observers to say it was a bluff, introduced to assuage the concerns of German taxpayers whose frustration at the prospect of having to bail out indebted southern European countries indefinitely has been on the rise.</p> <p>A poll before the ruling showed that 54% of Germans wanted the court to block the ESM, amid growing fears that Germany is ceding too many powers to European institutions. The court was petitioned by 37,000 Germans arguing that the ESM was anti-constitutional.</p> <p>The ruling is a breakthrough for Merkel and allows the go-ahead of the two-pronged approach she favours of both bailouts and budgetary discipline in the form of the ESM and the fiscal pact. She said the decision sent a strong signal of Germany's commitment to Europe, and was positive news for German taxpayers, who she said had been provided with certainty.</p> <p>\"This is a good day for Germany, a good day for Europe,\" she told the Bundestag. \"We haven't yet overcome the crisis, but we have achieved our first steps.\"</p> <p>Frank-Walter Steinmeier, leader of the opposition Social Democrats, expressed his relief that the ESM \u2013 whose creation had been substantially delayed by the constitutional court's deliberations \u2013 could now start to work. \"The significance of this decision for the future of Europe cannot be underestimated,\" he told the Bundestag.</p> <p>Neil Prothero, of the Economist Intelligence Unit, said the decision would come as a relief to policymakers across the eurozone. \"A decision against the ESM would have thrown the region's crisis response strategy into disarray,\" he said.</p> <p>But Gunnar Beck, an EU analyst at London's School of Oriental and African Studies, called the decision \"a completely absurd judgment from a legal point of view\", because it meant Germany's liability was fixed \"unless it is decided otherwise, which means there's no limit to it\".</p> <p>He was gloomy about the long-term effects of the decision, predicting that the markets' enthusiasm would not last. \"In the short term the market will be booming, but in the long term this means unending horror. Germany is locked in now and it means that if the ECB buys unlimited bonds, Germany's liability is unlimited as well,\" he said. \"Germany is like a bank that has lent too much to its biggest client so that it has to continue lending until the client goes bust\".</p> <p>The court had been under huge pressure not to torpedo the ESM, amid fears that it would cause the destruction of the euro and have a chaotic effect on the global economy. Andreas Vosskuhle, the court's president, said the economic and political consequences of delaying the law's introduction were \"almost impossible to calculate reliably\".</p> <p>Despite repeated claims of the court's independence, there have been strong suggestions of at least one high-level meeting between the government and the court, reports about which led to speculation that the two bodies might have worked closely on a face-saving solution.</p> <p>A little light relief amid the gravitas was offered by a slip of the tongue by Vosskuhle, who called the petitions to block the ESM \"justified\" before changing it to \"unjustified\" after being corrected by a colleague, as peals of laughter filled the courtroom.</p> <h2>Bank power balance<br></h2> <p>The EU executive has unveiled new laws empowering the European Central Bank to police 6,000 banks in the eurozone, a step towards a more centralised federation in response to almost three years of the bloc's currency crisis.</p> <p>The aim, accompanied by decisions on direct eurozone recapitalisation of struggling banks, is to establish a far more robust supervisory and regulatory regime over the banks and to break the pernicious links between weak sovereigns and vulnerable banks feeding Europe's debt crisis.</p> <p>While broadly welcomed by all of the EU including Britain, which will take no part in the new regime, the detail of the draft legislation will be hugely contested by EU governments between now and the end of the year, with London and Berlin squaring off as opposite poles in the argument.</p> <p>Signalling the new draft represented just the start of months of wrestling over the outcome, a British diplomat said: \"A banking union for the euro area must also respect the integrity of the single market for the whole of the European Union, and we'll ensure the agreement on it does that.\"</p> <p>Germany strongly resists planned supervision of all 6,000 banks, seeking to minimise the ECB's remit to just 20-odd \"systemic\" banks, the biggest in the eurozone, which would include only two German institutions. Berlin is also reluctant to rush into using eurozone bailout funds for direct bank recapitalisation.</p> <p>Berlin, the first to call for the \"banking union\" and to insist that the supervisory powers be vested in the ECB in Frankfurt, appear to be keen on the policing of eurozone banks as long as few as possible German banks are controlled.</p> <p>The British, remaining outside the new regime, are worried about the impact of the new system on non-euro members, on the European single market, and on the City of London, disputing complicated new proposed voting arrangements they fear could leave them defenceless against moves to penalise London-based banks while making it harder to force action against eurozone banks.</p> <p>For the ECB to gain the sweeping new powers,including that to grant and withdraw banking licenses in the eurozone, all 27 EU governments must agree, giving the UK a veto if they fail to force concessions.</p> <p>The ECB's supervisory role is to be phased in, according to the plan, kicking off next January with extensive intrusive powers of scrutiny over weak banks already being bailed out, notably in Spain, extending to the 20-30 systemic banks by the middle of next year, and then putting all 6,000 banks under ECB policing by the beginning of 2014.</p> <p>The draft law concerns solely supervisory powers. The plan is to then expand the regime over a few years to include a common eurozone resolution authority and funds for winding up or restructuring failing banks as well as common deposit guarantee schemes for eurozone savers.</p> <p>Both elements are also contested by Berlin which is wary of being made co-liable for the costs of other countries' banking failures and savings guarantees. While the new ECB regime will apply to all of the eurozone, non-euro countries can also come under the system without gaining voting rights in the new ECB supervisory board. Of the non-euro countries, Poland is the keenest to join but is also arguing for better terms.</p> <p>While Michel Barnier, the single market commissioner in charge, sounded optimistic on Wednesday that several non-euro countries would join the new supervisory system, senior officials expect it to start with only the 17 single currency countries.</p> <p>The trickiest part of the new system concerns relations between the ECB authority representing the 17 and the London-based European Banking Authority which groups national supervisors and coordinates between them.</p> <p>The Germans are scathing about the performance of the EBA, the ECB in Frankfurt sees it as a rival, while the British are worried that the role of the EBA is actually being strengthened and could damage UK interests.</p> <p><strong> Ian Traynor in Brussels</strong></p>",
  "<p>Scientists have partially restored the hearing of deaf gerbils with injections of nerve cells created from human embryonic stem cells.</p> <p>The procedure marks a first step towards treating deaf people by replacing damaged auditory neurons in the hearing system.</p> <p>Researchers at the University of Sheffield said the treatment, if proven to be safe and effective, could be suitable for about 15% of the 10 million deaf people in Britain who have a condition called <a href=\"http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing/pages/neuropathy.aspx\" title=\"NIDCD: Auditory neuropathy\">auditory neuropathy</a>. The disorder occurs when nerves that ferry acoustic signals to the brain are damaged or destroyed.</p> <p>The team, led by <a href=\"http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/bms/research/rivolta\" title=\"Sheffield University; Marcelo Rivolta\">Marcelo Rivolta</a>, took human embryonic stem cells, which can grow into many different tissue types, and transformed them with chemical growth factors into both early stage auditory neurons and sensory hair cells found in the cochlea \u2013 the spiral tube that forms part of the inner ear. Together, these cells convert sounds from the outside world into electrical signals.</p> <p>Tests on cells created in the lab found they processed electrical signals in a similar way to healthy adult auditory cells, a sign that they should perform normally when implanted.</p> <p>The scientists tried the auditory neurons on gerbils because they have a hearing range close to that of humans.</p> <p>The animals were first given a drug in one ear that caused deafness by damaging the auditory nerves. The team then cut an incision behind the ear, drilled a small hole in the temporal bone to get into the cochlea, and injected about 50,000 of the early-stage auditory neurons.</p> <p>After 10 weeks, the 18 animals that received cell implants had regained 46% of their hearing ability on average, measured by the volume of sound to which they responded.</p> <p>A control group of eight gerbils that received no treatment remained profoundly deaf. The animals' hearing was also tested by using electrodes to pick up brain signals triggered by sound.</p> <p>\"If this were a human patient, it would mean going from being so deaf that you wouldn't be able to hear a lorry on the street to a point where you can maintain a conversation in this room,\" Rivolta told a press conference in London.</p> <p>\"It's not a full restoration and the restoration is very variable but, on average, that is the kind of recovery we see.\"</p> <p>The improvement in the animals' hearing depended on the number of injected nerve cells that took hold in the cochlea. On average, about a third of the 50,000 cells remained in the inner ear after 10 weeks. Some of the animals regained almost no hearing. The work appears in the journal <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature11415\" title=\"Nature: Restoration of auditory evoked responses by human  ES-cell-derived otic progenitors  \">Nature</a>.</p> <p>The Sheffield team has yet to transplant the sensory hair cells into animals. These cells have the potential to treat a much larger proportion of people who are deaf, but the procedure is more complicated.</p> <p>Rivolta said it would be several years before the nerve cells could be trialled in humans. In some patients, the cells could ultimately be used alongside cochlear implants, which help restore hearing in people whose deafness is caused by damaged or destroyed sensory hair cells.</p> <p>Ralph Holme, head of biomedical research for <a href=\"http://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/\" title=\"Action on Hearing Loss\">Action on Hearing Loss</a>, which part-funded the study, said the work was tremendously encouraging and gave \"real hope that it will be possible to fix the actual cause of some types of hearing loss in the future\".</p>",

And by conventional we mean rooted in the pop conventions of the past, only of different eras. They mix and match well, though, creating not a radical juxtaposition of contrasting opposites but a smooth puree of sounds and styles. The vocals, in particular, are striking \u2013 strikingly suave and serene, as though from that pre-British Invasion period when pop was dominated by cutely dashing boys called Bobby (<a href=\"http://www.honeyguide.co.uk/images/6a00d414298a4e3c7f0123ddd1739d860d-500pi.jpg\" title=\"\">Vee</a>, Vinton, Darin). Every word is enunciated with a clarity and precision that is quite unusual these days, and the production further ensures that no syllable is missed. Meanwhile, the guitars have a <a href=\"http://www.alisdair.com/africanpages/africanhighlife.html\" title=\"\">high-life accent</a>, the beats are tropical, the melodies are memorable, and there are keyboards aplenty, although synthpop this ain't. The band themselves reference \"the [early-] 70s AM pop of Todd Rundgren\" in their blurb, but we can hear more of a late-70s radio sheen. It's doo wop innocence meets the mellifluous MOR of Fleetwood Mac. In Africa.</p> <p>Blacks&amp; (Black Sand, presumably) began playing as a band last summer and have since carved out a large following on LA's live circuit, playing everywhere \"from summer parties to heaving, sweaty clubs\". This is what they tell us anyway. Everything else we're having to glean from their music, which is fine, because we could listen to it all day, quite a compliment considering there are only three tracks \u2013 that's, what, four hours per track, with eight hours for sleep? We really like them. Their debut single, The Race Is On, is the first release on new imprint Hey Moon. The title song is spare but lush, lilting and lovely, with a pretty bass pattern, a smattering of clattering on the drum rims and a keyboard accompaniment that provides a wash of sadness as a second synth bubbles away. You can imagine it soundtracking a movie where Adam Sandler makes a klutz of himself but still manages to prove irresistible to Jennifer Aniston. It's pure romance with a dash of magic and mystery. What race? The singer doesn't say. What he does say is that he's \"been to Skid Row\" and \"chased a diamond down a rabbit hole\" and still he isn't sure what he wants. He's chasing the ineffability of rapture, and he could be some time. But it takes less than the five minutes that it lasts for us to decide it's one of the best things we've heard in its class \u2013 and it is pure class \u2013 all (late) summer. The other two songs on the single don't let the side down. Tonight plays the same trick: sumptuous arrangement, lyric with a kick (\"I can't face those demons tonight\"). And What They Think is a cool caress, its oohs and aahs lapping creamily against the keyboards and guitars. Popped-up shimmerfunk is what it is. Someone asked recently why Blacks&amp; weren't \"completely swarmed in Band to Watch hype yet?\" They will be now.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"The band has delicately crafted a delightful island pop sound with angular tendencies\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.weallwantsomeone.org/2012/04/06/blacks-the-race-is-on/\" title=\"\">weallwantsomeone.org</a>.</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> It's sugary and sweet \u2013 but just <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz5Ubqhru7g\" title=\"\">go with it</a>.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Be wedding singers.</p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oigOOCGp2M\" title=\"\">Be zoo keepers</a>.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> The Race Is On is released by Hey Moon on 22 October.</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> Vampire Weekend, Fleetwood Mac, Todd Rundgren, Work Drugs.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://blacksandmusic.bandcamp.com\" title=\"\">blacksandmusic.bandcamp.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>Thursday's new band:</strong> The GTW &amp; Bengfang.</p>",
  "<p>Three of South Africa's biggest mines came to a standstill on Wednesday as wildcat strikes spurred by a police massacre and firebrand politician threatened to paralyse the industry.</p> <p>A walkout at the Lonmin platinum mine in Marikana, where 34 workers were gunned down by police last month, showed no sign of relenting, with the company reporting attendance down to 1.8% at all its shafts.</p> <p>The unrest continued to spread elsewhere as security guards fired teargas at strikers at Gold Fields' KDC west gold mine, near Carletonville, where 85% of the workforce downed tools. The company said the workers had been intimidating and threatening contractors.</p> <p>The world's top platinum producer was also hit. A column of 1,500 marchers, chanting and waving sticks, confronted riot police backed by armoured vehicles in a tense stand-off at Anglo American Platinum's Bathopele shaft. The company said it had to redirect its staff from the premises for their own safety.</p> <p>The mining sector, which accounts for a fifth of South African gross domestic product, has been in turmoil since the strike at Marikana last month which led to the deaths of 44 people, including police and security guards.</p> <p>On Tuesday, near the area where miners were striking, another, unidentified, body was found with deep cuts in the back of the neck.</p> <p>The flames have been fanned by Julius Malema, a former youth leader who was expelled from the governing African National Congress for ill discipline this year.</p> <p>ANC officials and unions have accused him of exploiting the situation at the mines so as to revive his career, but Malema's ferocious anti-elite rhetoric has struck a chord with angry miners who feel betrayed by the government. Malema has toured mines making soapbox speeches and urging a national strike.</p> <p>In an interview on South Africa's Talk Radio 702 on Wednesday, Malema said: \"We are calling for mine change in South Africa. We want the mines nationalised. We want the workers paid a living wage \u2026 and somebody has to listen.</p> <p>\"Maybe this call has been ridiculed \u2026 by the authorities and mining bosses. Now we want to show them that we mean business. We are going to be engaging in very peaceful yet radical and militant action that will hit straight into the pockets of white monopoly capital.\"</p> <p>Malema, who is facing an official investigation into corruption, widened his campaign on Wednesday by addressing disgruntled members of the South African army, prompting the country's military bases to be placed on high alert for the first time since the advent of democracy in 1994.</p> <p>Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, the defence minister, accused him of trying to \"mobilise against the state\".</p> <p>Speaking to about 60 soldiers in civilian clothes at a recreation centre south of Johannesburg, Malema said he would never conspire to overthrow the government through undemocratic means, but told his audience to mobilise in a disciplined way to save their jobs.</p> <p>He condemned the president, Jacob Zuma, for treating them as a low priority and he drew attention to the president's polygamous lifestyle.</p> <p>He said: \"I don't know what is a priority to him, maybe getting married every year. He specialises on that one. Maybe that is what is going right for him.</p> <p>\"Here, children don't have books, people in hospitals don't have the necessary machines, they don't have roads or clean water.</p> <p>\"No one is above the law, not the military, not the presidency, and not parliament. Every court decision must be respected. We must respect the courts, but the leadership of this banana republic disrespects the courts.\"</p> <p>Malema led the crowd in an alternative version of the struggle song that led to a court action against him for hate speech. Instead of the lyric Shoot the Boer, he settled for Kiss the Boer.</p> <p>In another flash of humour <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Julius_S_Malema\" title=\"Malema tweeted\">Malema tweeted</a>: \"Defence Minister &amp; Mr Zuma can remove the SANDF on high-alert now. We are finished with the mtng and there is no mutiny &amp; no coup de tat.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, at Anglo American Platinum's Bathopele shaft protesters jeered fellow workers inside the plant.</p> <p>One man, who did not wish to be named, told Reuters: \"We are here to say to the men that work here that you must join us in the strike. We are not here to fight.\"</p> <p>Anglo American Platinum said some operations had been halted by what it described as \"widespread cases of intimidation\". It claimed that many of the protesters were not its employees but members of neighbouring communities.</p> <p>Evans Ramokga, a workers' leader, threatened to stop production in the entire platinum belt around the city of Rustenburg. \"On Thursday we are going to combine efforts with the striking comrades at Lonmin mines,\" he told South African media. \"We want to assure you that by Monday next week there will be no mining operation in Rustenburg.\"</p> <p>Four Anglo American Platinum mines near Rustenburg employ more than 19,000 people, but have come under pressure since a collapse in platinum prices in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>South Africa is home to 80% of known reserves of platinum, which is used in jewellery and vehicle catalytic converters. The platinum price has gained nearly 20% since the shootings at Marikana, the worst security incident since the end of apartheid in 1994.</p> <p>The strikes, which stem from a challenge by the small but militant Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) to the dominance of the ANC-affiliated National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), are also infecting the gold sector.</p> <p>The NUM said workers at the Beatrix mine, run by Gold Fields, were set to strike this week, compounding industrial action already underway by 15,000 workers at the company's KDC West mine west of Johannesburg.</p> <p>Malema has appeared twice at KDC to speak to striking workers and call for a monthly, five-day, national shutdown and the removal of the NUM's president.</p> <p>His messages typically point to a narrow elite that has benefited in the 18 years since the end of racial apartheid but failed to deliver jobs and services to the majority. In one refrain, he said: \"They have been stealing this gold from you. Now it's your turn.\"</p> <p>The shootings at Marikana, and the government's inability to resolve the unrest, is also giving fresh impetus to a campaign to unseat Zuma at internal ANC elections in December. Malema has repeatedly called for him to stand down.</p>",
  "<p>Mexico's small and medium sized enterprises account for more than 99% of the four million businesses in the country, generate 52% of GDP and provide 72% of employment. The government's business accelerator programme supports these SMEs by funding institutions that can help the sector grow by improving competitiveness, business opportunities and market scalability.</p> <p>One such business accelerator is the IDEARSE Center at Anahuac University in Mexico City. The centre's business model for SME acceleration is built around CSR, incorporating environmental impacts, human rights, self-regulation, social impacts and community involvement and stakeholder engagement.</p> <p>More remarkable still is that, by working with the supply chains of big brands such as Sony, Coca-Cola and Cemex and having trained more than 150 SMEs since 2007, the SMEs achieved sales growth of between 5% and 37% and jobs growth of between 5% and 19%. At the same time SME performance across all six CSR areas has improved between 23% and 46%. These numbers debunk several popular myths, most notably that CSR is not relevant, too expensive or not incentivised for SMEs. Let's look more closely at these myths.</p> <h2><strong>Is CSR relevant for SMEs?</strong></h2> <p>The issue of relevance largely hinges on whether you adopt a very literal and narrow interpretation of CSR. Laura Spence, director of the Royal Holloway, University of London's <a href=\"http://www.rhul.ac.uk/management/cris/\" title=\"\">Centre for Research into Sustainability</a>, says that the terminology of CSR is both inaccurate (as small firms are unlikely to be corporations) and off-putting jargon for SMEs.</p> <p>\"Also since CSR practice is often associated with reporting, SMEs don't stand a chance. They are unlikely to have external financial reports, let alone the time resources or need to produce a glossy CSR report,\" says Spence.</p> <p>So first, we need to get the labels and definitions right. The IDEARSE centre, for example, describes CSR as \"a permanent and continuous commitment, voluntarily adopted by the business, to respond to the economic, social and environmental impacts of its activities, and to guarantee the sustainable and human development to all its stakeholders.\" No doubt, it helps that CSR in Spanish (responsabilidad social empresarial or RSE) translates more accurately as socially responsible 'enterprise'.</p> <h2>Explicit or implicit CSR?</h2> <p>The second issue \u2013 whether CSR is too costly \u2013 is a real concern, but once again, it depends what we mean by CSR. Work by CSR academics Dirk Matten and Jeremy Moon distinguish between explicit and implicit CSR. Explicit CSR refers to many of the formalised practices we associate with large corporates, such as CSR codes, standards, managers, systems, reports and audits. These are resource intensive and mostly not feasible for SMEs.</p> <p>Implicit CSR, on the other hand, includes informal ethical practices that are not dependent on size or financial muscle. \"If you talk about the content of a socially responsible business \u2013 integrity, reputation, caring for employees, building relationships, community engagement \u2013 that is often simply an everyday part of SME life,\" Spence says. Many SMEs, thus, are practicing social responsibility without even knowing it or needing to give it a CSR label.</p> <p>Besides these implicit CSR practices, Itzel Lopez of the IDEARSE centre says that CSR is often crucial for SMEs because it can be \"a requirement imposed, not by the law, but by the market itself.\"</p> <p>She is referring to the growing practice of large companies in demanding ethical standards of their suppliers. Nike's supplier code of conduct and Walmart's supplier sustainability assessment are two cases that increasingly illustrate the rule rather than the exception.</p> <p>There is also a middle ground between too costly (explicit CSR) and business critical (supply chain compliance). As with CSR practiced by multinationals, SMEs can often find a business case in cost savings from eco-efficiency, especially from reductions in waste, water and energy. Furthermore, Lopez believes that \"CSR strategies can lend prestige and boost consumer confidence. They can also increase productivity by motivating employees and encourage loyalty.\"</p> <h2>Collaboration, values and frameworks</h2> <p>We should also not totally discount formalised CSR practices among SMEs. One of the things I observed when visiting the sugar plantations of Guatemala was that they had formed a cooperative of farms in order to tackle CSR. Individually, they were too small to justify a sustainable business programme, but collectively, it made sense. This is one of the ways that SMEs can address CSR, through pooling their resources and collaborating.</p> <p>On the issue of incentives, as most SMEs are owner-managed, the values of the director play a crucial role. My experience has been that most SME owners live in their communities and that responsibility often comes naturally to them. After all, they usually have to personally interact with their customers every day. The exceptions tend to be when SMEs are entirely set up for export and their employees are not also their customers. This not only creates worker dependency, but also low accountability for impacts on the community and environment.</p> <p>Besides the moral orientation of SME owners, governments can also help to create incentives for CSR adoption. It is no surprise that the IDEARSE centre was selected as one of the business accelerators in Mexico, since the government developed a national CSR standard in 2004 and has subsequently adopted ISO 26000 on social responsibility as a best practice guideline. Local support is also important. For instance, some years back I observed a local government agency in Scotland that had established a dedicated unit to offer free sustainable business advisory services to SMEs.</p> <p>But there is no denying that SMEs face many barriers \u2013 from alienating definitions and weak incentives to prohibitive costs and heavy-handed supply chain audits. But at least perceptions are changing, the evidence of benefits is mounting and helpful tools are increasingly available, such as the recently launched <a href=\"http://nbs.net/knowledge/primer-business-sustainability-for-smes/\" title=\"\">Primer on Business Sustainability for SMEs</a> and ACCA's report on <a href=\"http://www.accaglobal.com/content/dam/acca/global/PDF-technical/small-business/rr-128-001.pdf\" title=\"\">Environmental Aspects of Sustainability: SMEs and the Role of the Accountant</a>.</p> <p>I look forward to the day when pioneering British economist EF Schumacher's small is beautiful idiom applies as much to sustainable business as to economic activity. If Mexico's example is anything to go by, that day may come sooner than we expect.</p> <p><em>Wayne Visser is director of Kaleidoscope Futures and senior associate at the </em><a href=\"http://www.cpsl.cam.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>University of Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership</em></a><em>.

  "<p>Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the president of the European commission, has thrown fresh doubt on claims by Alex Salmond that an independent Scotland would automatically remain within the EU.</p> <p>Barroso said new states that hoped to join the EU would have to apply for membership in their own right, appearing to quash Salmond's assertions that an independent Scotland would inherit its share of the UK's membership.</p> <p>Meanwhile a spokesman in Brussels appeared to retract a similar statement implying that Catalonia would have to reapply if it seceded from Spain.</p> <p>In an interview with the BBC, Barroso said he would not discuss Scotland's future within the UK.</p> <p>\"I am not going to speculate now about possible secessions, it is not my job. But I can tell you that to join the European Union, yes, we have a procedure. It is a procedure of international law,\" he said.</p> <p>\"A state has to be a democracy first of all, and that state has to apply to become a member of the European Union and all the other member states have to give their consent.\"</p> <p>Pressed on whether all new countries were regarded as new states by the EU, Barroso said: \"A new state, if it wants to join the European Union, has to apply to become a member like any state. In fact, I see no country leaving and I see many countries wanting to join.\"</p> <p>His remarks put Salmond under pressure to defend his government's position, which is intended to reassure Scottish voters in the runup to the independence referendum in 2014 that there are few risks posed by breaking away from the UK.</p> <p>His intervention produced a clear shift in stance from the first minister.</p> <p>Earlier on Wednesday Keith Brown, Scottish government minister, said an independent Scotland would \"take on the same obligations and treaties that we currently have\". However, Salmond confirmed last that fresh negotiations with the EU would be needed after independence.</p> <p>\"Yes, there will have to be negotiations, the negotiations will take place from within the context of the European union. The negotiations are about the representation Scotland will have and the rest of it.\"</p> <p>There is little doubt an independent Scotland would join the EU, but this intervention suggests there may be a delay.</p> <p>The pro-UK parties and the Better Together campaign said Barroso's remarks were a blow to Salmond and the Scottish government as it threw into doubt his assertions that Scotland would not need to join the euro as required for new member states or have to adopt tougher treaty obligations on border controls, crime and security.</p> <p>Salmond and his ministers had previously repeatedly argued that after independence Scotland would automatically inherit all the UK's ties and treaty optouts as a successor state.</p> <p>Scottish ministers have also suggested that could mean the rest of the UK would have to renegotiate membership of the EU at the same time.</p> <p>The Scottish government said it had legal and expert opinions to support that case. Salmond has refused, however, to publish his government's legal advice on EU membership and has gone to court to overturn a ruling by the Scottish information commissioner requiring its publication.</p> <p>A Better Together spokesman said: \"We now have it straight from the horse's mouth. Scotland will have to apply to be a member of the European Union if it breaks away from Britain to form a separate state. The SNP's assertion that we would be granted automatic entry has proven to be, like so many of their arguments, a baseless assertion.\"</p> <p>Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, said: \"We now have the European commission reaffirming what everyone knows \u2013 that a separate Scotland cannot simply waltz into the EU unchallenged. Application to the EU means Scotland would have to take the euro, could have huge implications about corporation tax \u2013 leaving the country at a disadvantage to the rest of the UK \u2013 and could affect border and passport arrangements.\"</p> <p>On Tuesday a European commission spokesman, Olivier Bailly, said that after independence Scotland would have to apply to join the EU afresh. \"There are two different steps, there is a secession process under international law and the request for accession to EU member state under the EU treaties,\" Bailly said. \"In the meantime, of course, the new treaty is not part of the EU as he [sic] has to make request for accession.\"</p> <p>Aware that his remarks had caused a storm of protest in Catalonia, where 1.5 million people marched in support of independence this week, Bailly appeared to retract the statement on Wednesday, saying he had been speaking about a \"hypothetical scenario\". It was not the commission's role to speculate about the internal affairs of member states, he said.</p> <p>Academics believe that in reality, a newly independent country's negotiations with Brussels would be based on the premise that the EU would be very keen to keep an independent Catalonia or Scotland within the union, since the EU is an expansionist organisation that believes in pan-European integration.</p> <p>A Scottish government spokesman said: \"As we have always said, an independent Scotland will remain an integral part of the EU, as it has been for almost four decades, and by definition Scotland already meets all the criteria of EU membership.\"</p> <p>Following Barosso's remarks, a Foreign Office spokesman said: \"It is clear that the Scottish government cannot take for granted the idea that Scotland would secede from the UK but automatically stay in the EU. [The] most likely scenario would be that Scotland would have to join the EU as a new state, requiring negotiation with other member states.\"</p>",
  "<p>On 15 April, 1989, the Hillsborough disaster took place - it led to 96 deaths and the publication today of a <a href=\"http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk\">major independent inquiry</a> into the events, the police actions and the subsequent cover-up.</p> <p>As part of the inquiry, <a href=\"http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/catalogue/index/organisation/all/outofscope/all/perpage/20/page/1.html\">thousands of documents have been released</a>, in one of the most organised official crowdsourcing exercises ever. And all as open data. </p> <p>It's a fascinating data dump and a great source for anyone interested in data journalism. This is my first take. </p> <p>There are 25,911 documents released today by the panel - over 450,000 pages published on its site, which also allows you to download the full catalogue, which we've done here. Unlike many official reports, the team have <a href=\"http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/open-data/\">signed up to open data in a big way</a> and have made the metadata publicly available, complete with links so the scraping of all the documents is made easier. There's also a guide to <a href=\"http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/open-data/taxonomy/\">what the headings mean</a>.</p> <p>What kinds of documents were they?</p> <p>The vast majority - 25,246 - were on paper; memos, letters and reports. These have now been digitised by the team at the Inquiry. There were also 297 photographs and 22 audio/visual reports, with a handful more on disk, and even ancient formats such as floppy disks and computer tapes.</p> <p></p> <p>12,905, half of all the documents, came from the South Yorkshire police, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-disaster-david-cameron-apologises\">which was heavily criticised</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The panel concluded that the main cause of the Hillsborough disaster was a \"failure in police control\" but also revealed \"multiple failures\" within other organisations that compromised crowd safety.

  "<p>Leadership and team development are siblings of the business world, but how to be effective in both are usually the questions first asked by the business leaders of today. Before looking at the bottom line, securing investment or breaking into international markets, business leaders in the creative industries are most concerned by leadership and team development.</p> <p>This was a finding from research released this month by <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Nesta</a> that looked at the attitudes of creative industry executives towards business operations. It found that the top two rated questions an executive would ask a business mentor would be: how can I be a better leader; and how do I build and develop the best team?</p> <p>This year, I have been asked to be a mentor for <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/areas_of_work/creative_economy/creative_business_mentor_network#mentors\" title=\"\">Nesta's Creative Business Mentor Network</a>, and the findings of the survey prompted me to think about the advice that businesses in the creative industries will be looking for.</p> <h2>How can I be a better leader?</h2> <p>It's worth distinguishing leadership from management. It's a real issue in early-stage companies, not least because the size of the team frequently means these two functions have to be performed by the same person. A founder may drive the business strategically \u2013 but also give instructions to a small team of developers or designers, who perhaps are too young and inexperienced to manage themselves.</p> <p>Plus, there is no one else to do it. Even when there's more than one business owner, the usual scenario is that sometime early on in getting the business going the question was asked: who's going to run this thing? And the others took a pace backwards, leaving the most organised and numerate one in the frame. I call this person 'the reluctant MD' and they are everywhere in creative businesses.</p> <p>This awkward hybrid, the leader/manager, can helm a fledgling creative enterprise only so far along the path of growth, until it reaches a point in size and complexity where leadership and management add up to more than one full-time job. One common solution is for the person to work the hours of one-and-a-half people \u2013 again, we all know people like this.</p> <p>We also know that it is not sustainable. Stress, exhaustion, botched home lives, tattered relationships, anxiety, indecision and errors at work are the recurring symptoms of this state.</p> <p>So leadership must be separated from management, sooner or later, for the sake of everyone's sanity and good health. My own prescription for this malaise is to develop the more capable and mature people on the team to run the business, together as a team, day-to-day. Generally, they are already there, invariably in positions that are unequal to their abilities; held down by 'flat' organisational structures, by control-obsessed founders and reactive short-term thinking. The most demanding task is always to get the leader/manager to trust their team, to learn how to delegate, empower and let go. It's a massive emotional wrench for many owners, convinced that they are the only person who can run the business.</p> <p>So, if it is possible to free up a founder to become a leader, what do they need in order to play that role? It's a long list, so I'll focus on three things that are essential: vision, self-management and getting out of the way.</p> <p>There's an old adage that you cannot lead if you don't know where you're going. Correct. Yet it is surprising how many entrepreneurs have no idea or image of where they want to get to. They often have numbers \u2013 for turnover, net profit, staff numbers, how many international offices or whatever \u2013 but no real sense of what the destination looks and feels like.</p> <p>I get them to draw pictures, which some find surprisingly difficult. Vision is, literally, an image \u2013 however crude \u2013 of the thing you want to create. Most leaders could, if they chose, get a secure, comfortable and well-paid full-time job. So they have chosen this much harder path for a reason. They're heading somewhere, and I work with them to make them aware of it.</p> <p>Vision does not only give the leader a sense of purpose, meaning and direction; it is crucial in defining a differentiated offer and positioning for the business. It is essential to motivate and inspire the team. And it leads to road maps and business plans \u2013 the practical instruments for organising the realisation of vision \u2013 the getting-there.</p> <h2>How do I build and develop the best team? </h2> <p>Start with managing yourself. Self-management might seem an odd thing for a leader to focus on, but you soon see its importance when a leader lacks it. The Greek philosopher Epictetus established this way of thinking two and a half millennia ago, but it's best summed up in this 19th century version: \"Who is fit to govern others? He who governs himself.\"</p> <p>You cannot lead others effectively if you are not aware of, and actively managing, your own emotional state. If your internal workings tend towards insecurity and anxiety, you will be an autocratic, controlling and untrusting leader who repeatedly slips back into managing others' work for them. If you are needy and insecure, your leadership will be distorted by wanting people to like you, and your desire for approbation will engender weak decision-making and indulgence of under-performing favourites. The individual variations are infinite, but the core principle remains the same.</p> <p>Finally, the necessity of 'getting out of the way' \u2013 I'm indebted here to the influential business philosopher Peter Koestenbaum, who has stated that a key function of a leader is to develop the individual freedom of the others. When working as a business leader, it is my goal \u2013 and I fail, frequently \u2013 to never tell anyone what to do. That's a manager's job.</p> <p>The leader ensures that the conditions \u2013 organisational structure, processes, infrastructure, clarity of roles and responsibilities, training and personal development, culture etc \u2013 are all in place to enable the individuals on the team to do, to their highest ability, what they are there to do. There may well be some upfront work needed to help those individuals see their tasks clearly. That in itself is a job for the empathetic leader.</p> <p>But once all those conditions are in place there is absolutely no doubt about the leader's next action. They have to get out of the way, and find the next challenge for the business, the next steps on the journey, the latest iteration of the vision. Once the team really gets going, it's back to the drawing board for the leader.</p> <p><em>Steve Taylor is part-time chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.the-neighbourhood.com/\" title=\"\"><em>The Neighbourhood</em></a><em> and a mentor for Nesta's Creative Business Mentor Network, which is open for applications until 13 September 2012 \u2013 </em><a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/areas_of_work/creative_economy/creative_business_mentor_network\" title=\"\"><em>apply and find out more here</em></a></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/media-network/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> to the </strong><a href=\"http://guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/12/chris-stevens-us-ambassador-libya-killed\" title=\"\">assassination in Benghazi of the American ambassador to Libya</a> is an appalling act \u2013 and one foreseen by his employers. On 27 August, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10410528\" title=\"\">the state department warned US citizens against all but essential travel to Libya</a>, painting a picture of a country beset by increasing instability and fraught with danger.</p> <p>\"The incidence of violent crime, especially carjacking and robbery, has become a serious problem\u2026 Political violence, including car bombings in Tripoli and assassinations of military officers and alleged former regime officials in Benghazi, has increased. Inter-militia conflict can erupt at any time or any place in the country,\" the state department said.</p> <p>Exactly who is responsible for the death of Christopher Stevens and three embassy staff is unclear. Libyan officials blamed pro-Gaddafi loyalists linked to the bombings in Tripoli. Salafists, ultra-conservative Muslims who besieged the Benghazi consulate overnight, seem to be the more likely culprits. They have mounted a string of recent attacks on Sufi shrines and are said to have been enraged by clips of a film on the internet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2012/sep/12/libya-anti-muhammad-youtube-clips\" title=\"\">that defames the prophet Muhammad</a>.</p> <p>Any number of other Libyan armed groups might have had a hand in the killings. But in truth, responsibility may also be traced back, directly or indirectly, to those in London, Paris, Brussels and Washington who launched last year's Nato intervention in Libya with insouciant disregard for the consequences. It was clear then, or should have been, that toppling Muammar Gaddafi was the easy bit. Preventing an Iraq-style implosion, or some form of Afghan anarchy, would be much harder.</p> <p>Yet this is exactly what Stevens's death may presage. Once again, the western powers have started a fire they cannot extinguish. A year after David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy jointly travelled to Libya to lay claim to a liberator's bogus laurels, the Libyan revolution they fanned and fuelled is in danger of degenerating into a chaotic, violent free-for-all.</p> <p>Do not be misled by the fig leaf of this summer's national assembly polls. Post-Gaddafi Libya lacks viable national political leadership, a constitution, functioning institutions, and most importantly, security. Nationwide parliamentary elections are still a year away. The east-west divide is as problematic as ever. Political factions fight over the bones of the former regime, symbolised by the forthcoming trials of Gaddafi's son, Saif, and his intelligence chief, Abdullah al-Senussi.</p> <p>Effective central control, meanwhile, is largely absent. And into this vacuum have stepped armed groups \u2013 whether politically, religiously or financially inspired matters little \u2013 all claiming sectional suzerainty over the multitude of fractured fiefdoms that was, until Nato barged in, a unified state.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/H-Research_Notes/SAS-Research-Note-18.pdf\" title=\"\">Research published in June by the Small Arms Survey</a> suggested that the emergence and influence of armed groups challenging national government and army was accelerating rapidly. The survey identified four distinct types including experienced revolutionary brigades accounting for up to 85% of all weapons not controlled by the state and myriad militias \u2013 loosely defined as armed gangs, criminal networks and religious extremists bent on exploiting post-revolution weakness.</p> <p>A power struggle is now under way between the Libyan army and these various groups, and while some play a constructive role, others threaten the future of the Libyan state, the survey said. In Misrata, for example, in addition to about 30,000 small arms, revolutionary brigades \"control more than 820 tanks, dozens of heavy artillery pieces, and more than 2,300 vehicles equipped with machine-guns and anti-aircraft weapons.\" Misrata, scene of some of the worst fighting last year, has become a state within a state.</p> <p>In its weakened condition, politically and economically, Libya appears especially vulnerable to extremist ideology and foreign influence. In an echo of Taliban depredations, the Salafists who besieged the Benghazi consulate have also been involved in a wave of attacks on historic Sufi mosques and libraries and attempts to intimidate female university students who eschew the hijab.</p> <p>In this they are reportedly encouraged by a Saudi-based scholar, Sheik Mohamed Al-Madkhalee, who issued a fatwa praising the desecration of Sufi graves and urging Libyan Salafists to do more to clear the country of the taint of Sufi worship. According to author Jamie Dettmer <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/04/ultraconservative-salafists-destroy-sufi-landmarks-in-libya.html\" title=\"\">writing in the Daily Beast</a>, the Libyan government has complained to Riyadh about al-Madkhalee, but to no avail.</p> <p>Christopher Stevens was a respected diplomat who was helping hold Libya together in the wake of last year's upheavals. Maybe it was always an impossible task. But it was rendered all the harder by western politicians who, just as in Iraq, jumped feet first into a complex situation without sufficient care or thought for the future.</p>",

He said: \"It has taken more than two decades, 400,000 documents and a two-year inquiry to discover to my horror that it would have been far more accurate had I written the headline The Lies rather than The Truth. I published in good faith and I am sorry that it was so wrong.\"</p> <p>MacKenzie added: \"I too was totally misled. Twenty-three years ago I was handed a piece of copy from a reputable news agency in Sheffield in which a senior police officer and a senior local MP were making serious allegations against fans in the stadium.</p> <p>\"I had absolutely no reason to believe that these authority figures would lie and deceive over such a disaster.</p> <p>\"As the prime minister has made clear these allegations were wholly untrue and were part of a concerted plot by police officers to discredit the supporters thereby shifting the blame for the tragedy from themselves.\"</p> <p>Hillsborough campaigner Trevor Hicks, who lost two daughters in the disaster, branded MacKenzie's apology \"too little, too late\", calling him \"lowlife, clever lowlife, but lowlife\".</p> <p>The damning report detailed attempts to shift the blame for Hillsborough on to Liverpool supporters, including how police witness statements submitted to Lord Justice Taylor's earlier inquiry were doctored. It also for the first time identifies a Tory MP, Irvine Patnick, and high-ranking South Yorkshire police officers as the sources for the allegations that led to the Sun's notorious front page.</p> <p>The April 1989 splash claimed in three sub-headlines that: \"Some fans picked pockets of victims; Some fans urinated on the brave cops; Some fans beat up PC giving kiss of life\". Other papers carried the story but qualified it by saying there were reports that fans had been abusive.</p> <p>Documents released to the Hillsborough independent panel showed that the South Yorkshire police federation and Patnick, the then MP for Sheffield Hallam, were responsible for passing false allegations to Whites Press Agency in Sheffield that led to the Sun story.</p> <p>In the past MacKenzie has said a Tory MP had made the allegations, protesting that his only \"mistake was I believed what an MP said\".</p> <p>The prime minister told parliament that the families \"were right\" to have \"long believed that some of the authorities attempted to create a completely unjust account of events that sought to blame the fans for what happened\".</p> <p>In an opening address on the report, Cameron said: \"Several newspapers reported false allegations that fans were drunk and violent and stole from the dead.</p> <p>\"The Sun's report sensationalised these allegations under a banner headline 'The Truth'. This was clearly wrong and caused huge offence, distress and hurt.\"</p> <p>Cameron revealed that News International had co-operated with the Hillsborough panel. \"For the first time, today's report reveals that the source for these despicable untruths was a Sheffield news agency reporting conversations with South Yorkshire police and Irvine Patnick, the then MP for Sheffield Hallam,\" said Cameron.</p> <p>During questions about MacKenzie's legacy in relation to Hillsborough, he said he \"hopes he stands up to his responsibilities\".</p> <p>Asked by Labour MP Chris Bryant whether the Sun should apologise, Cameron said he understood that the paper had done so in the past.</p> <p>However he added what the paper had written was \"appalling\" and \"my view is that Kelvin MacKenzie needs to take responsibility for that\". He added: \"Now is the time for proper heartfelt apologies, not only 'I'm sorry' but here's what went wrong.\"</p> <p>The current editor of the Sun, Dominic Mohan, said on Wednesday that the paper was \"deeply ashamed and profoundly sorry\" for publishing \"an inaccurate and offensive story\" and would be \"reflect our deep sense of shame\" in Thursday's edition.</p> <p>In July 2004, the Sun said it was \"truly sorry\" and that its false allegations were \"the most terrible mistake in its history\". It made the statement after Wayne Rooney, who then played for Everton, was criticised for a series of exclusive interviews.</p> <p>Less than a year later, in February 2005, the Sun's managing editor Graham Dudman, admitted in a BBC documentary that the Hillsborough coverage <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2005/jan/31/sun.mondaymediasection\" title=\"\">was \"the worst mistake in our history\"</a>.</p> <p>However a year later, old wounds were re-opened after MacKenzie was quoted as saying at a private business lunch with a Newcastle law firm: \"All I did wrong was tell the truth ... I was not sorry then and I'm not sorry now because we told the truth.\"</p> <p>London mayor Boris Johnson was also called upon to apologise to the people of Liverpool. In 2004, when Johnson was editor of the Spectator, the magazine carried an editorial which blamed \"drunken fans at the back of the crowd who mindlessly tried to fight their way into the ground\" for playing a part in the disaster. The editorial added: \"The police became a convenient scapegoat, and the Sun newspaper a whipping boy for daring, albeit in a tasteless fashion, to hint at the wider causes of the incident.\"</p> <p>Johnson swiftly said he regretted the editorial, but Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi asked David Cameron to demand a proper apology from Johnson. The prime minister agreed.</p> <p>\"People right across the country, whether they are in positions of power or not, this now is the proper explanation of what happened and people who thought it was something else need to come to their senses and realise this is what happened.\"</p>",
  "<p>Germany's political elite is relieved. T<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/12/german-court-euro-rescue-fund\" title=\"\">he Karlsruhe court ruling on the constitutionality of the euro bailout fund</a> unties chancellor Angela Merkel's hands in the longrunning effort to save the single currency.</p> <p>But it also highlights the curbs on any German government's freedom to make policy, particularly on arguably the most pressing issue in Merkel's in-tray \u2014 what to do about Europe?</p> <p>Merkel's mantra in recent weeks is that she wants \"more Europe\". Her Christian Democratic party has passed a motion calling for greater European integration. On Wednesday in his state of the union speech to the European parliament, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, president of the European commission, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/12/eurozone-crisis-german-court-bailout-fund#block-50503823c0e312b4deaa485b\" title=\"\">lined up behind Merkel for the first time with a radical rallying call</a>.</p> <p>\"Let's not be afraid of the words. We will need to move towards a federation of nation states. This is what we need. This is our political horizon,\" he declared.</p> <p>A new European federation with common fiscal, economic, and budget policies stripping national parliaments and governments of the most fundamental powers, a directly elected president of Europe with the main European political party groupings putting up candidates at the next European parliament elections in 2014 for Barroso's job \u2014 head of the European executive.</p> <p>All of this effectively requires a new European constitution or at the very least a renegotiation of the Lisbon treaty, triggering referendums in some countries, including Britain and in all likelihood a UK exit from the EU.</p> <p>It's not a new, but a nonetheless radical federalist blueprint re-energised by the EU's worst ever crisis, the euro meltdown. Much of this vision is not only shared but originates in Berlin.</p> <p>But it would never get past the eight judges in Karlsruhe.</p> <p>Is Merkel serious about her European \"political union\"?</p> <p>\"It might be a distraction from the immediate crisis, but yes, they're serious,\" said Katinka Barysch, a German economist at the Centre for European Reform. \"You can still convince most Germans that more Europe is a good thing. And they're doing this out of political necessity, to show the public they're not panicking blindly because of market pressure.\"</p> <p>The problem for the politicians is the constitutional court. \"The <em>Grundgesetz</em> [basic law] is a constraint,\" added Barysch.</p> <p>The proposals from Barroso on Wednesday and the kind of EU quantum leap being mulled in Berlin require vast transfers of sovereignty to EU institutions from national parliaments and governments.</p> <p>Karlsruhe already set firm limits on this in its verdict on the Lisbon treaty a couple of years ago. Andreas Vosskuhle, the judge who read out Wednesday's verdict, has said previously that the scope for further European integration is already exhausted under the terms of Germany's constitution.</p> <p>In short, Germany as well as the EU needs a new constitution for the Merkel-Barroso vision to be more than a mirage. And that means a referendum.</p> <p>National referendums are banned in Germany because of the plebiscitary abuse performed during the Third Reich. The sole grounds for a referendum is to change the constitution. This is already shaping up to be a major issue on the assumption that Merkel wins a third term a year from now. If, as often predicted, she forms a \"grand coalition\" with the opposition social democrats, the two big pro-EU parties will have a thumping majority to push constitutional change.</p> <p>\"Everything will depend on what coalition she forms next year,\" said Ulrike Guerot of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.</p> <p>\"The pressure on the constitution has become so high that you cannot make the big game-shift.\"</p> <p>All of this is treacherous political territory where Merkel has to perform two formidable and parallel tasks \u2014 persuade German public opinion, fed up with the euro crisis and revering the big independent institutions, the court in Karlsruhe and the Bundesbank in Frankfurt, that the Basic Law needs to be changed, while also coaxing the rest of the leaders of Europe into backing what Barroso is describing as a \"new deal.\"</p> <p>No French president has ever assented to the federalist plot. Will Fran\u00e7ois Hollande be any different? While supporting German hawkishness on the euro crisis, the Dutch don't want to transfer any more powers to Brussels. Another Irish referendum could wreck the gameplan. No British government would take part.</p> <p>At which point the Germans and Barroso will lower their sights and settle for a eurozone rather than a full EU federation. Berlin will tell Paris and everyone else that if they want to use German credit cards to guarantee or redeem their debt, the federation is the price they will have to pay.</p> <p>Much of the eurozone is keen on pooling liability, but not on giving up sovereignty, Merkel is fond of complaining.</p> <p>Hollande, if he is unable to turn around a weakening French economy, will face very tough choices.</p> <p>\"The really big German concern is about France,\" said Guerot. \"That's the big debate, but it's a Venus-Mars discussion. Will France make the compromise needed for political union to get German money? Either the French jump or we all don't jump at all.\"</p>",
  "<h2>CAMERON APOLOGISES AS HILLSBOROUGH COVER-UP EXPOSED</h2> <p>David Cameron said he was \"profoundly sorry\" for the failures that caused the Hillsborough disaster and the subsequent attempts to shift blame for the tragedy on to supporters after the publication of a damning report on the events 23 years ago that left 96 dead. Speaking in the Commons, the prime minister said the findings in the report were \"deeply distressing\", adding: \"With the weight of the new evidence in the report it's right for me today as prime minister to make a proper apology to the families of the 96 \u2026 On behalf of the government, and indeed of our country, I am profoundly sorry that this double injustice has been left uncorrected for so long\"</p> <p>The report by the Hillsborough Independent Panel, established three years ago and chaired by the Bishop of Liverpool, James Jones, found that there was a failure of authorities to protect people and an attempt to blame fans. The panel concluded that the main cause of the Hillsborough disaster was a \"failure in police control\" but also revealed \"multiple failures\" within other organisations that compromised crowd safety. It underlined the \"clear operational failure\" that led to the disaster and the attempts by South Yorkshire police (SYP) and the ambulance service to cover up their shortcomings. The fact that the ambulance service also altered statements from staff is revealed for the first time. The evidence shows \"conclusively\" that Liverpool fans \"neither caused nor contributed to the deaths\" and shows the extent to which attempts, endorsed by the South Yorkshire chief constable Peter Wright, were made to smear them.</p> <p>Documents released to the panel show how high-ranking police sources, the South Yorkshire Police Federation and the Tory MP Irvine Patnick were responsible for feeding the stories to Whites News Agency in Yorkshire. They led to the infamous Sun headline \"The Truth\" that led to a longstanding boycott of the paper in Liverpool.</p> <p>\"The Police Federation, supported informally by the SYP chief constable, sought to develop and publicise a version of events derived in police officers' allegations of drunkenness, ticketless fans and violence. This extended beyond the media to parliament,\" said the panel. \"From the mass of documents, television and CCTV coverage disclosed to the panel there is no evidence to support these allegations other than a few isolated examples of aggressive or verbally abusive behaviour clearly reflecting frustration and desperation. The vast majority of fans on the pitch assisted in rescuing and evacuating the dead and injured.\"</p> <p>The panel found that 164 police statements were significantly amended and 116 explicitly removed negative comments about the policing operation, including its lack of leadership, a revelation that drew gasps when relayed by Cameron in parliament. Officers carried out police national computer checks on those who had died in an attempt \"to impugn the reputations of the deceased\" and the coroner took blood alcohol levels from all of the deceased, including children. The panel found that close analysis of the documents demonstrated that the weight placed on blood alcohol levels was inappropriate, fuelling \"persistent and unsustainable assertions about drunken fan behaviour not supported by evidence of moderate patterns of drinking unremarkable for a leisure event.\"</p> <p>Documents disclosed to the panel also reveal that the original pathologists' evidence of a single unvarying pattern of death is unsustainable. The assumption was the basis of a coroner's imposition of a 3.15pm cut-off on evidence to the inquests. It led to the mistaken belief that an effective emergency service intervention could not have saved lives. The panel's disclosure confirms that in some cases death was not immediate and the outcome depended on events after 3.15pm. Dr Bill Kirkup, from the panel, said at a press conference at the Anglican cathedral in Liverpool that 41 of the victims had \"potential to survive\", although he could not say for sure how many could have been saved.</p> <p>Cameron said it would be for the attorney general to decide whether to apply to the high court to quash the original inquest and seek a new one, as the families are demanding. But he added that it was clear \"today's report raises vital questions which must be examined\". The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, made his own apology for his party not doing more to uncover the truth during its 13 years in office from 1997 to 2010. \"We on this side also apologise to the families that we didn't do enough to help,\" he said. A succession of MPs called for legal action against those responsible for the failures that led to the tragedy or who were involved in the subsequent cover-up, variously suggesting that proceedings should be brought for defamation, misconduct in public office and perverting the course of justice.</p> <p>More than 23 years after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/datablog/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-victims-list\" title=\"\">96 men, women and children</a> died in the Leppings Lane end of the ground on 15 April 1989, the families of those who died gave the panel a standing ovation in Liverpool Cathedral as it delivered its findings. \"For nearly a quarter of a century the families of the 96 and the survivors of Hillsborough have nursed an open wound waiting for answers to unresolved questions. It has been a frustrating and painful experience adding to their grief. In spite of all the investigations they have sensed that their search for truth and justice has been thwarted and that no one has been held accountable,\" said Jones. \"The documents disclosed to and analysed by the panel show that the tragedy should never have happened. There were clear operational failures in response to the disaster and in its aftermath there were strenuous attempts to deflect the blame on to the fans. The panel's detailed report shows how vulnerable victims, survivors and their families are when transparency and accountability are compromised.\"</p> <p>Sheila Coleman of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign welcomed Cameron's apology. She told BBC Radio 4's World at One that the inquest verdicts \"have to be quashed\" and that criminal charges should be brought \"because all the evidence today shows that South Yorkshire police and people in South Yorkshire police lied and operated a cover-up.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 The full report from the Hillsborough Independent Panel <a href=\"http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/hc1213/hc05/0581/0581.pdf\">is available as a downloadable pdf here</a>, while all 450,000 documents reviewed by the panel <a href=\"http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">can be accessed here</a>.</em></p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY No1</h2> <p>\"Quite simply, yes\" \u2013 Michael Mansfield QC, when asked if this is the biggest cover-up in British history.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY No2</h2> <p>\"Too little, too late.

In one corner you had the Pollyannas, Exciting Mr Roy casting off the impression that he was about to go postal while doing his Norman Collier chicken routine up the touchline, and optimistic greybeard Craig \"pure dead brilliant\" Levein channelling out the jeers to emphasise the positives. In the other the Eeyores, Michael \"the secret manager\" O'Neill and Chris \"down the dip\" Coleman lamenting the shortcoming of Norn Iron and Wales with faces as long as undertakers' tape measures.</p> <p>\"I was very pleased with many of the aspects of the play tonight,\" said Mr Roy of England's draw with Ukraine after Tom Cleverley spurned three chances to gloss over familiar failings and the sauce flowed so freely in the sponsors' area that they initially tried to give the man of the match award to $tevie Mbe.</p> <p>\"I leave Wembley a lot more confident that we have a group of players who will take this England team to Rio,\" Mr Roy continued, doing the opposite of what he intended by raising doubt about an outcome that had been taken for granted. The original concern had been how rubbish they'll be once they're there but after last night we're not even sure of that.</p> <p>Meanwhile at Hampden Park Levein enjoyed an encore of boos after yet another sterile Scotland performance, this time in a miserable 1-1 draw with Macedonia. Afterwards he looked at the dregs in his glass and declared himself overjoyed by their abundance. \"I look at the league table and we are two points off the top after two matches and there's 24 points left to play for,\" he said, narrowing his eyes to suggest the nuggets asking the questions would be brave to quibble with this spin.</p> <p>Levein can lend Coleman his rosy specs when Scotland play in Cardiff next month and on the evidence of Serbia's trouncing of Wales the Scots will need to have the finishing of a Cleverley or the selection policy of a Levein not to at least score. \"To lose 6-1 is an absolute hammering and we can't ignore that,\" Coleman said. \"To say we are disappointed is an understatement and we have to do much better because the goals we conceded were criminal. I'm embarrassed by the performance, I have to use that word.\" Criminal? Crivens, that'll do wonders for morale.</p> <p>Over in Belfast O'Neill joined Coleman in the dumps. \"I'm very disappointed. We had enough chances to win more than one game and we didn't capitalise,\" he said after the 1-1 draw with the team formerly known as Luxembourgnil. \"We probably let anxiety creep into our play too easily and our performance suffered as a result,\" he went on, promising to address it, which would help. That and tattooing \"the recipient is in an offside position if he is nearer to his opponents' goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent\" on Kyle Lafferty's arm.</p> <h2>GET A FREE \u00a325 BET WITH BLUE SQUARE</h2> <p><a href=\"http://ads.bluesq.com/redirect.aspx?pid=5296&amp;bid=2932\" title=\"\">Step one: open an account with Blue Square and deposit any amount; step two: place a bet of at least \u00a35 on any sport; step three: we will match your bet with a free bet of up to \u00a325</a>.</p> <h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2> <p>\"The FA must have figured out that getting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/12/england-brazil-ireland-fa-anniversary\" title=\"\">a hiding by an actually good team</a> is a good way to boost your Fifa ranking.

In the case of Churchill, I conducted one of the final interviews she did \u2013 for the Independent in 1987, when Serious Money opened \u2013 and so have occasionally felt like someone who hears that their former partner has become a celibate nun.</p> <p>I did once check, through a mutual acquaintance, that it wasn't me who had turned Churchill off the whole business, and received a kind and polite reply, explaining that she was simply happier to let the work speak for itself. It had also been apparent during our conversation on the steps of the Royal Court that the writer is naturally shy \u2013 a quality shared with Alan Bennett and Terry Johnson, two playwrights who have likewise avoided interviews unless the pleas of producers and marketing departments persuade them to help with the sale of tickets.</p> <p>As a member of the interviewers' union, I should probably regard these writers as brewers see teetotallers or undertakers view immortals. But, in fact, I have some sympathy for the view once expressed by Michael Frayn, in a newspaper interview about Copenhagen, that he didn't \"spend two years writing a play in order to sum it up impromptu over lunch\". Although, ironically, the ability to deliver such colourful soundbites explains why people are always so keen to talk to him.</p> <p>The problem Frayn expresses is clearly one that many writers feel. If you've researched and written a complex drama about a mysterious meeting between the nuclear physicists Heisenberg and Bohr, and chosen a structure that reflects the historical ambiguities, it is no doubt depressing to be questioned on what you think really happened or what you meant \u2013 even, if in my experience, the best conversations about a new piece of art tend to be plot-spoiling, theme-revealing or intrusively autobiographical.</p> <p>For me, there is a lot of sense in the American practice \u2013 followed, for example, by the New York Times \u2013 of delaying interviews until after the opening night, when a project's content and commercial prospects are clearer, and creators feel more free to speak. But in the UK the journalistic impetus to get in first, and the pressure to use interviews as a publicity tactic (cheaper than buying advertising), mean that preview pieces remain the main tool.</p> <p>Churchill and Tucker Green, though, decline interview requests no matter when they're scheduled to occur. Why? My guess \u2013 clearly, I haven't been able to ask her \u2013 is that Churchill may feel weary as well as wary about enduring questions on her own attitudes to feminism, women in the workplace, marriage and motherhood, which each revival of Top Girls might invite. Instead of reading or listening to her opinions on such matters, she might rather people watch her arguing with herself \u2013 the dynamic of any good play \u2013 and then argue among themselves. And, if I were Debbie Tucker Green's PR adviser, I would warn her that conversations about Random (the TV adaptation of which recently won the Bafta best single drama award) would inevitably invite questions about racism and knife violence, the play's themes. Perhaps she simply prefers to remain a writer-director rather than being co-opted by the media as a social cohesion tsar.</p> <p>Strangely, I have found myself sitting next to both Churchill and Tucker Green at performances of their plays. In what was probably a failure of journalism \u2013 but possibly a human virtue \u2013 I left them alone, on the grounds that it would be like trying to force a large scotch on a recovering alcoholic.</p> <p>The only weakness of this attitude is that, when a work becomes publicly contested, the writer may be tried and convicted in their absence. When Churchill's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/apr/06/caryl-churchill-seven-jewish-children\" title=\"\">Seven Jewish Children: A Play for Gaza</a> (2009) was accused by some of anti-semitism in its depiction of Israel's history, the dramatist defended herself in press statements and letters to newspapers, but her absence from TV and radio studios gave an advantage to her detractors.</p> <p>Also, while interviews have many faults, there is a benefit for posterity and academic study in being able to hear and see a writer discussing their methods and intentions. If either Churchill or Tucker Green wish to renounce their vow of silence, I'm available \u2013 but will fully understand if they won't.</p>",
  "<p>Manchester's Town hall, opened in 1877 and designed by Alfred Waterhouse in the then fashionable neo-Gothic style, is one of the jewels in the city's architectural crown, visited by thousands every year. </p> <p>There is one notable exception to the list of visitors, however: Queen Victoria. </p> <p>When asked to perform the opening ceremony, she refused.</p> <p>Whilst no reason was publicly stated, it was widely believed that this was because of the radical past of the Lord Mayor at the time, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel_Heywood\">Coun Abel Heywood</a> who was born in Prestwich in 1810 and began work in a warehouse aged just nine. When he was older he attended evening classes to improve his education and eventually went into business, running a reading room and selling books.</p> <p>In 1832, the year of the Great Reform Act, he was sent to the New Bailey prison in Salford for four months for selling an unstamped newspaper, <em><a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRpoor.htm\">The Poor Man's Guardian</a></em>, a weekly journal published by <a href=\"http://www.chartists.net/Henry-Hetherington.htm\">Thomas Hetherington</a> from 1830 to 1835 with the resounding strapline 'Published in Defiance of the Law to try the power of Might against Right.' The government had imposed a stamp-duty on newspapers in 1819 in an attempt to price out of existence the vigorous radical press of the period, especially <em>Cobbett's Weekly Register</em> which exposed conditions in the countryside every bit as dire as in the new mill towns. </p> <p>Heywood was an active <a href=\"http://www.chartists.net\">Chartist</a>, publishing the movement's literature from his bookselling business at 60 Oldham Street. He was fined again in 1834 and 1836. He was also elected as a Commissioner of the Police but that did not stop him being prosecuted yet again in 1840 for selling allegedly \"blasphemous material\". The book in question was C. J. Halam's Letters to the Clergy, mild indeed by the standards of today. </p> <p>Heywood also stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in 1859 and 1865 as a Liberal in Manchester. In 1862 he became Lord Mayor for the first time, working hard to alleviate the distress caused by the Cotton Famine. He was Lord Mayor again from 1876 to 1877. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396049160\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2011/11/16/1321464553793/The-clock-tower-at-Manche-008.jpg\" alt=\"The clock tower at Manchester Town Hall\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Look what she missed, daft thing. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Queen Victoria's refusal excited a great deal of comment. W.E.Axon, for instance, published a pamphlet entitled <em>The Mayor of Manchester and his Slanderers</em>, refuting the rumours circulating in the city that Heywood had been prosecuted for selling obscene publications, rather than the unstamped press:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He need fear no scrutiny of the past, for his conduct has been that of a steady and consistent friend of progress and popular rights. He was not afraid of espousing the right when it was unpopular. He has suffered fine and imprisonment in defence of that liberty of speech which all now enjoy. If the Crown deliberately abstains from honouring the man who has made his way in the world by sheer force of character; the man who has not flinched to make heavy sacrifices for the causes he deems to be right; the man who has earned the respect of his fellow-citizens by his long labours on their behalf, then the discredit attaches itself not to the victim but to the Minister who allows himself to become the tool of party spite or personal malice.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Rejected by the Queen, the Corporation brightly asked Heywood to perform the opening ceremony instead. At a meeting in the new Town Hall, Robert Austin of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers proposed a procession of the trade societies to add to the proceedings. W.H.Wood of the Typographical Society, who was Secretary of the Manchester Trades Union Council, was appointed Secretary of the organising committee. </p> <p>In this era most people worked all day on Saturdays, so the committee placed advertisments in the press asking employers to give their workers time off to take part in the procession. </p> <p>On the day itself, 15 September, there were three assembly points \u2013 Piccadilly, Stevenson Square and Oldham Road. In all some 69 trade societies took part, with the procession stretching for over a mile and taking three hours to pass the Town Hall steps where Abel and his wife stood in modest glory. The <em>Manchester Guardian </em>reported:</p> <blockquote> <p>The display of banners in Market Street and other parts of the route was tasteful if not profuse. Not a window from which a view of the procession could be had was without its occupants, and no available spot on the tops of the buildings commanding a sight of the display was not utilised. Albert Square was, of course, the centre of the demonstration, and a most animated picture was there presented. The members of the Corporation and the Corporation officials were privileged to bring their families to the Town Hall, the Mayor having set apart the windows for their use. The magnificent offices and warehouses on all sides of the square were picturesquely decorated and the windows thereof were alive with cheerful faces looking at the panorama below.</p> </blockquote> <p>More than 50,000 people were estimated to have taken part, with the largest contingent being from the Amalgamated Society Of Engineers, who numbered 3,000. The General Union of Carpenters carried a banner which proclaimed: </p> <blockquote> <p>Those who assert that politics will ruin trades unions have yet something to learn </p> </blockquote> <p><br>whilst the Tailors and Tailoresses carried a banner showing Adam and Eve wearing aprons made from fig leaves \u2013 the world's first clothes! The Manchester Tin Makers were led by a silk banner representing the arms of the trade followed by a mounted knight in armour. The chimney sweeps seem to have been mainly Irish, for they carried a banner with a picture of Daniel O'Connell which said 'Ireland remembers O'Connell'. The Union of Operative Bakers carried a 16lb loaf. There were also many local and military bands on the procession.</p> <p>The clock bell of the Town Hall, Great Abel, is named after Heywood and weighs 8 tons.

  "<p>Somalia's newly elected president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, has escaped injury after suicide bombers attacked a hotel in Mogadishu where he was holding a news conference with visiting Kenyan officials.</p> <p>Islamist militants from al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack, which served as a deadly reminder of the challenges facing the 57-year-old professor as he seeks to end more than two decades of conflict.</p> <p>A spokesman for Mogadishu's mayor said two suicide bombers had blown themselves up at the gate of the hotel and at least five people had been killed. There were reports that a third suicide bomb had failed to detonate.</p> <p>Mohamud was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/10/somalia-chooses-new-president-elections?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">elected by MPs on Monday</a>, becoming the first new leader to be chosen inside Somalia since the military dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown in 1991. Mohamud defeated the incumbent Sheikh Sharif Ahmed, whose UN-backed transitional administration was accused of being corrupt and inept.</p> <p>After Mohamud's election, al-Shabaab branded him a traitor and described the vote as a ploy by the west to boost its economic and strategic interests.</p> <p>\"The fact that Hassan Sheikh Mohamud is not an Islamist in the mould of his predecessor will give an additional edge to al-Shabaab's continued opposition,\" said J Peter Pham, director of the Africa programme at the <a href=\"http://www.acus.org/\" title=\"\">Atlantic Council</a> in Washington. \"The euphoria surrounding [his] appointment \u2026 needs to be tempered by recognition of the realities confronting him.\"</p> <p>Al-Shabaab had threatened Mohamud, who founded the Peace and Development party in 2011, in the past. \"Anybody who lives here in Mogadishu always lives under enormous risk. We have a coping mechanism but it doesn't always work,\" he told the Guardian in an interview last month.</p> <p>Since al-Shabaab withdrew from Mogadishu last year after fierce battles with the African Union peacekeeping force Amisom, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/19/somalians-planning-better-future\" title=\"\">the city has experienced something of a rebirth</a>, with new buildings rising among the ruins and Somalis returning from abroad to open businesses.</p> <p>Although weakened, the al-Qaida-linked militant group still controls the southern port of Kismayo and launches regular hit-and-run attacks on areas under Amisom and Somali army control, including inside Mogadishu.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Amisom said Somali government forces, backed by its troops, had seized the town of Harbole as they pushed from Afmadow to Kismayo.</p> <p>However, despite the military push, some observers are wary of predictions of al-Shabaab's demise.</p> <p>Pham said al-Shabaab would remain a threat to Somalia and neighbouring countries even in the event of an attack on Kismayo.</p> <p>\"When and if that action succeeds, the defeat of al-Shabaab as an insurgency may well have the unintended consequence of turning the hardcore elements of the movement \u2026 into the very type of fully fledged terrorist group that \u2026 it could not be so long as it also had to play the role of an insurgency-cum-territorial administration.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Additional reporting by David Smith in Johannesburg</p>",
  "<p>In October last year I wrote a blog item headlined <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2011/oct/17/sun-hillsborough-disaster\">The Sun's Hillsborough source has never been a secret - it was the police</a>. So today's confirmation came as little surprise.</p> <p>A couple of months later, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2011/dec/09/kelvin-mackenzie-hillsborough-disaster\">I also wrote about the former Sun editor,</a> Kelvin MacKenzie, having falsely claimed that the front page article he published in 1989, \"The Truth\", was filed by a Liverpool news agency (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2011/dec/09/kelvin-mackenzie-liverpool\">which he retracted within 24 hours</a>). </p> <p>That allegation prompted a former Daily Mirror reporter, Gordon Hay, to email me and give an interesting insight into what happened the night The Sun ran its controversial story. I am now able to tell it for the first time.<br> Three days after the tragedy, the Mirror had three reporters in Liverpool - the vastly experienced Syd Young (now retired), plus Christian Gysin (now with the Daily Mail) and Hay (now running <a href=\"http://www.hay-mckerron.co.uk/who-we-are.html\">a media consultancy</a> in Scotland). </p> <p>The London newsdesk called to alert them to copy that had been filed by Whites news agency in Sheffield that afternoon (<a href=\"http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/repository/docs/NGN000000010001.pdf\">here's a pdf copy of that</a>). It made serious allegations against the Liverpool fans, claiming they had been drunk, had pick-pocketed victims and had urinated on policemen.</p> <p>The trio were told by the newsdesk briefer that he had previously called the paper's two reporters in Sheffield - the late Ted Oliver and Frank Thorne (now freelancing in Australia) - with the same information. They had looked into it and rejected it as untrue. </p> <p>They told the desk they could not stand up the allegations so they would not be filing. Oliver actually said that if such a story appeared under his byline he would resign.<br> So Young, Gysin and Hay made calls too and couldn't find any supporting evidence for the allegations. Indeed, all the indications they were getting suggested \"the Yorkshire cops were trying to divert attention away from their own failings.\"</p> <p>Hay told me: \"We discussed it and, having agreed that we could not verify the claims, passed on [to the desk] our suspicions about the Yorkshire police spin.\"<br> He was full of praise for the response of the night news editor, the now-retired Mark Dowdney. Hay said: \"Despite the pressures on him and the knowledge that others might run with the story, he sided with his men in the field and spiked the story.\"</p> <p>Well, he didn't actually spike it. But the Mirror's extreme scepticism about the claims - properly reflecting the views of their five reporters in Sheffield and Liverpool - is clear from the angle the paper took, exemplified by the headline, \"Fury as police claim victims were robbed.\" Very different, in other words, to \"The truth\".</p> <h2>Why Whites news agency filed its controversial story</h2> <p>One of the most revealing documents to emerge today is <a href=\"http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/repository/docs/NGN000000070001.pdf\">a memo from Whites to the London Evening Standard's news editor</a> about its original copy. Clearly, the paper had raised queries about the authenticity of the allegations made in its copy sent on 18 April. </p> <p>Dated 12 June, the memo mentions four unidentified senior police sources plus \"a leading MP backing many of the police claims.\" It states:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"All the allegations in the stories we filed were made unsolicited by ranking officers in the South Yorkshire force to three different experienced senior journalists who are partners in this agency. All four ooficers involved had been on duty at Hillsborough.</p> <p>The first claims of bad behaviour came on Saturday April 15th, a few hours after the tragedy, when one reporter met by chance a senior police officer he has known for many years.</p> <p>Without prompting the officer told him he had been punched and urinated on as he tried to save a dying victim at Hillsborough. The following day there was another chance meeting with [a] second officer who again without prompting said he had seen some fans behaving badly, including attacking police and urinating on officers. </p> <p>At this stage we felt it was not enough confirmation to send a story making such serious claims. However, on Monday 17th another reporter met a third officer who volunteered information and reiterated similar stories saying he had seen police attacked and had been told of fans urinating down the terraces as police pulled away the dead and injured.</p> <p>At that stage we felt we should tell the story and sent it out the following morning... Later the same day a third reporter met a fourth officer he has known for many years who repeated the allegations and added that Liverpool supporters had been stealing from the dead. </p> <p>Though he had not seen it personally he said despite fingertip searches of the terracing a lot of personal property belonging to the dead was missing and other officers had told him of pilfering.</p> <p>We sent out the additional details plus a report by South Yorkshire's chief ambulance officer that one of his men was injured when attacked as he treated a an on the pitch.</p> <p>Further quotes were sent in a later story after we spoke to the Tory MP for Sheffield Hallam Irvine Patnick. He said he had spoken to police officers on Saturday night who said they had been attacked and urinated on. He had not volunteered the information previously because he felt it would inflame a very sensitive situation.</p> <p>We also added quotes from South Yorkshire's police federation secretary who said he had heard 'terrible' accounts of the behaviour of some fans. In some respects we 'watered down' the allegations...</p> <p>We felt we did as much as we could to check the authenticity of the story in the time available and reported faithfully what we were told.\"</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>All the world's a stage in John O'Keeffe's good-natured 1791 comedy, which reopens Bristol's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/sep/09/bristol-old-vic-reopens\" title=\"\">restored gem of a Georgian theatre</a>. There are few plays that invoke the spirit of Shakespeare quite so warmly as this tale of Jack Rover (Sam Alexander), a strolling player fond of quoting the Bard, who masquerades as a gentleman and falls into the arms of an heiress (Jo Herbert). She has come under the influence of the hypocritical Quaker, Ephraim Smooth (Philip Bird), who loathes everything to do with the theatre. There is a lovely moment when Smooth tosses a copy of Rover's beloved As You Like It to the ground. \"Trample on Shakespeare!\" screeches Rover, with the outrage of one who has had his holy book desecrated.</p> <p>The play \u2013 and Mark Rosenblatt's revival, which updates the action to the 1950s \u2013 are at their best when they are celebrating the wonder of theatre and the transformations of the heart, even if the plot is hardly a model of compactness. It involves a runaway son who has taken up with travelling players, a mislaid child and husband, a greedy farmer, a pantomime villain bailiff and an old sea dog whose wild oats are belatedly sprouting.</p> <p>Rosenblatt doesn't quite keep control as the confusions multiply, and is inclined to overlay the play's natural comedy with touches of his own. Some, such as Rover's defeat of a foe by mime, are sublime silliness; others fall flat \u2013 the motorcycle comic capers make it hard to get a grip on the narrative in the crucial opening moments.</p> <p>Although the production doesn't find its rhythm until the second half, it always looks good in Ben Stones' simple stage-within-a-stage design, and Alexander's Rover is a warm presence, almost a dashing one. It's such a genial play that it's impossible not to smile, even if this revival is not quite the riotous romp O'Keeffe's work deserves.</p> <p><em>What have you been to see lately?

  "<p>The long fuse that led to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/12/chris-stevens-us-ambassador-libya-killed\" title=\"\">explosion of violence that killed the US ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens</a>, was lit last summer in the pleasant hills of southern California, where a man who claims to be an Israeli-American real estate developer, Sam Bacile, set about making a film.</p> <p>The citrus groves and villas around Los Angeles are home not just to Hollywood but to a lucrative underside, a vast industry pumping out huge numbers of amateur, gonzo productions for internet distribution, most of them pornographic. But few have been intended to be as grotesquely offensive as Bacile's production, and none have had such explosive consequences.</p> <p>By his own account, Bacile raised a budget of $5m (\u00a33m) from 100 unnamed Jewish donors for The Innocence of Muslims, which he wrote and directed himself, with the aim of demonstrating his belief, as he <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444426404577647060576633348.html?mod=WSJ_World_LeadStoryEurope\" title=\"\">described it to the Wall Street Journal</a>, that \"Islam is a cancer\".</p> <p>To that end, Bacile got his amateur cast to depict the prophet Muhammad as a feckless philanderer who approved of child abuse. It took three months, 59 actors and about 45 crew. The result was two hours of stumbling dialogue and wooden acting among flimsy sets, and a stream of gratuitous insults aimed at Muslims. It was screened in an almost empty cinema in Hollywood earlier this year.</p> <p>In another age, that would probably have been the end of the story. But in the YouTube era, in which the voices of fanatics are amplified, it was a bomb primed for detonation, months later and thousands of miles away.</p> <p>Bacile posted a 13-minute English-language trailer on YouTube in early July but it was only in the past week that it appears to have caught the attention of combatants in the online culture wars.</p> <p>A Florida pastor, Terry Jones, who had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/02/nine-killed-81-injured-kandahar-protest-quran?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">triggered protests in the Islamic world by burning the Qur'an</a> and with his campaign to stop the construction of a mosque at the site of the 9/11 attacks, promoted the film on his website and announced his intention to broadcast the trailer at his Gainesville church this week.</p> <p>\"It is an American production, not designed to attack Muslims but to show the destructive ideology of Islam,\" he said in a statement. \"The movie further reveals in a satirical fashion the life of Muhammad.\"</p> <p>The film clip was also spotted and promoted last week by Morris Sadik, an Egyptian Coptic Christian based in California who runs a small virulently Islamophobic group called the National American Coptic Assembly. It was later denounced by mainstream Copts in Egypt, but it was too late to stop it going viral.</p> <p>At some point over the summer a version of the YouTube trailer surfaced with the dialogue dubbed in Egyptian Arabic \u2013 Bacile says he has no idea who did the translation but has claimed it sounded accurate \u2013 and the translated clip was picked up by a firebrand Cairo television host, Sheikh Khaled Abdallah, who has a record of focusing on perceived threats to Islam and amplifying them. He aired clips from the video on his television show on Saturday, and the same video clips were posted to YouTube on Monday.</p> <p>As the Arab audience for the film grew exponentially, militant Islamists called for a mass protest at the US embassy in Cairo. The organisers told Associated Press that planning began last week when Sadik began promoting the trailers but the support for the demonstration snowballed after the Sheikh Abdallah programme on Saturday.</p> <p>A crowd of some 2,000 is reported to have gathered outside the embassy walls in Cairo on Tuesday night, catching the local security services flat-flooted. Most of the diplomats and local staff had left early and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/11/egypt-protest\" title=\"\">a few dozen of the demonstrators were able to scale the wall, take down the stars and stripes and replace it with a black flag</a>. The Egyptian police only managed to evict them from the compound by late evening.</p> <p>By that time, however, the spark had jumped westwards to the Libyan city of Benghazi. According to al-Jazeera, an extremist militia called Ansar al-Sharia, one of many such <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/12/us-consulate-attack-libya-gaddafi\" title=\"\">armed groups staking out little fiefdoms in the aftermath of Muammar Gaddafi's fall</a>, heard about the storming of the Cairo embassy and the American film.</p> <p>According to al-Jazeera's correspondent in Benghazi, Suleiman Idrissi, \"At about 11.30 pm a group of people calling themselves Islamic law [Sharia] supporters heard there would be an American movie insulting the prophet Muhammad. Once they heard this news they came out out of their military garrison, and went into the streets calling on people to go ahead and attack the American consulate in Benghazi.\"</p> <p>Rocket-propelled grenades were reported to have been fired from a farm next door to the consulate, and film clips on al-Jazeera show men roaming through the ornate gardens amid vehicles, vegetation and buildings in flames. Ambassador Stevens, who was on a short visit to Benghazi, is reported to have died from smoke inhalation, along with an American computer expert at the consulate, Sean Smith, and two security guards.</p> <p>Smith was an internet gaming enthusiast and was chatting online to another player at the time of the attack. According to the other player, who goes by the online handle of The_Mittani, Smith \"said 'FUCK' and 'GUNFIRE' and then disconnected and never returned\".</p> <p>By Wednesday, Sam Bacile was in hiding. He spoke to Associated Press from an undisclosed location, saying he had not expected such a furious reaction.

  "<p>The differences in fundraising and charitable giving in different countries and cultures can give fundraisers pause for thought. As many countries are throwing off the old orders, how can fundraisers take advantage of new opportunities?</p> <p>Mark Cook of <a href=\"http://movingthinking.com/\" title=\"\">Moving Thinking </a>tells a story of the experiences of his uncle, an English ex-pat living in a small village in rural Thailand. The local temple regularly requests donations from people living in the village to fund small things like building a new shack for a destitute villager, refurbishing a classroom in the village school or helping a family with medical bills.</p> <p>The interesting part of the system is the attitude to donor privacy \u2013 or lack of it. In the centre of the village is a telegraph pole with a loud speaker attached to it for important public announcements. The temple uses this to announce the names of everyone that supports the current fundraiser, along with how much they've given. And they make these announcements loudly and often. The effect is powerful. Donors feel publicly recognised and feel good about doing it again. As a resident it is very hard to avoid donating (your neighbours will know and chastise you).</p> <p>A specific sum is usually requested and you must give around that sum or people will think you're mean. The wealthy villagers will often give high amounts to get the kudos of giving the most. It's a system that seems to work, but for a reserved Englishman it's excruciating. It tells us a lot about our expectations that our giving remain private and the comfort that affords.</p> <p>Sustainability is an issue in the Arab world. Atallah Kuttab, founder and chairman of <a href=\"http://saaned.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=64&amp;Itemid=72\" title=\"\">SAANED for Philanthropy Advisory</a> in the Arab Region, says: \"Fundraising in the Arab world is nascent and complex \u2013 intertwining between regulatory and religious, both in fundraising and service delivery. In some Arab countries, making a charitable donation to help those in another country can be illegal if it is outside the sanction of the government and if you do this you can get into big trouble. But people still give. In the move to strategic giving we are asking governments to relax rules on giving so strategic giving is easier.\"</p> <p>On the religious side, Islam has three ways of giving. Foremost and most ingrained in Islam's attitude to philanthropy is zakat where you are required to give a certain percentage (usually 2.5%) of your wealth above the amount you need to live on to charity. Indeed, there is an argument whether this should be seen as 'charity' or is more a 'right' of poor people.</p> <p>Then there is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waqf\" title=\"\">waqf</a>, which is similar to an endowment in Judaeo/Christian religion. Indeed, waqf is the forerunner of western giving, having been introduced by returning crusaders. There are guidelines as to how much you can give and where it should go. You must state what you are giving, what the intent is and who is the beneficiary. For example, you might give a sum of money to build a hospital to help the people of a certain city.</p> <p>Thirdly is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadaqah\" title=\"\">sadaqa</a>, \"voluntary charity' which is flexible \u2013 how much you want to give out on top of zakat \u2013 for public benefit. It might be donating money, volunteering or sponsoring an orphan. Atallah says: \"The religious side to giving is self-driving and you cannot do much with it, but you can find ways.\"</p> <p>In Libya now there is legislation being discussed for charities and Islamic ways of giving, but it is early days. One encouraging development is that whereas before the Arab Spring most Arab 'family' giving went to support causes on their doorsteps, it has recently been mobilised to support the opposition movements that toppled the Libyan regime, and the same seems to be happening in Syria. Atallah says: \"It was very moving to hear the story of the young Libyan living in Turkey who sold all the property he had inherited to fund the medical treatment of Libyans arriving in Turkey from Misrata in Libya and mobilised thousands of dollars from the Libyan diaspora and from people across the Arab region.\"</p> <p>It is clear that each region around the world has different cultures, channels, modes of interpersonal relationships (particularly about charity) and different infrastructures. Thus each region has different lessons to teach the rest of the world about fundraising. In tune with this, the <a href=\"http://www.resource-alliance.org/pages/en/ifc.html\">International Fundraising Congress </a>for the first time ever, this year will be introducing specific sessions offering new perspectives, case studies and insights on fundraising from different geographical areas around the globe including Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.</p> <p>These sessions have been design to allow fundraisers to learn from others how best to overcome regional challenges, enabling them to successfully raise funds and friends to solve global problems. Neelam Makhijani, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.resource-alliance.org/\" title=\"\">Resource Alliance </a>highlights \"There are fundraisers from over 60 different countries that come to the IFC which brings together such diversity. At this year's Congress, we are showcasing amazing fundraising stories from small and medium sized NGOs from Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle east. These stories will touch you, inspire you and will be a great source for learning. It is vital to the sector that fundraisers come together from across the globe to learn from each other and take advantage of different approaches. By doing this we can help create a strong and sustainable civil society for the future.\"</p> <p><em>Jon Shepherd is head of marketing and communications at the Resource Alliance, which is organising the </em><a href=\"http://www.resource-alliance.org/pages/en/ifc.html\" title=\"\"><em>International Fundraising Congress</em></a><em> in Amsterdam from 16-19 October this year. </em></p> <p><em>This article is sponsored by</em><a href=\"http://www.resource-alliance.org/\" title=\"\"><em> the Resource Alliance</em></a><em>, which organises the </em><a href=\"http://www.resource-alliance.org/pages/en/ifc.html\" title=\"\"><em>International Fundraising Congress</em></a><em>.</em></p>",
  "<p>Steve Caplan believes that calls for the academic boycott of Israel, part of the wider <a href=\"http://www.bdsmovement.net/\" title=\"\">Boycott Divestment Sanctions (BDS)</a> campaign, are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/occams-corner/2012/sep/11/academic-boycotts-science-hypocrisy-israeli\" title=\"\">hypocritical and counterproductive</a>. Leaving aside his Israel advocacy \"talking points\" version of history, Caplan's argument has three significant flaws.</p> <p>First, his only really substantive case against the boycott as a tactic is the claim that it is \"aimed at the very segment of the population\" \u2013 those in academia \u2013 who back Palestinian statehood and \"compromise\".</p> <p>But the assertion that Israeli professors are particularly supportive of Palestinian rights is made with scant evidence. Emphasising that \"as individuals they are not being boycotted\", Israeli activist Ofer Neiman tells me that \"the overwhelming majority of university professors do not act as dissidents. The best they will do is opine, and very softly. Very few of them use their enormous privileges \u2013 those that do are the exceptions.\"</p> <p>Indeed, as <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/leftist-views-don-t-keep-professors-from-teaching-at-ariel-1.458869\" title=\"\">an article in Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz</a> last month reported, even self-defining \"leftist\" academics who vote for Labor or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meretz\" title=\"\">Meretz</a> are happy to teach at the college in Ariel, an illegal West Bank settlement.</p> <p>These are the \"progressives\" who apparently support Palestinian rights, a distortion of reality similar to Caplan's praise for Yitzhak Rabin. In fact, the former Israeli PM's \"permanent solution\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1995/10/PM+Rabin+in+Knesset-+Ratification+of+Interim+Agree.htm\" title=\"\">as he told the Knesset shortly before he was assassinated</a> \u2013 meant giving Palestinians \"an entity which is less than a state\", with \"united Jerusalem\" as Israel's capital and \"the establishment of blocs of settlements\" in the West Bank.</p> <p>A second problem with Caplan's piece is the omission of a key part of the argument for a boycott: the complicity of Israeli academic institutions in an occupation where violations of international law and human rights are routine.</p> <p>A 2009 report, <a href=\"http://usacbi.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/economy_of_the_occupation_23-24.pdf\" title=\"\">\"Academic boycott of Israel and the complicity of Israeli academic institutions in occupation of Palestinian territories\"</a> did an excellent job of documenting ways in which \"Israeli academic institutions have not opted to take a neutral, apolitical position toward the Israeli occupation but to fully support the Israeli security forces and policies toward the Palestinians.\"</p> <p>As Sara Hirschhorn, who is actually an opponent of the boycott, put it in <a href=\"http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/occupying-minds/\" title=\"\">an op-ed for The Times of Israel</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The entire nation is complicit in the occupation, and there is no safe haven in the libraries and laboratories within the Green Line \u2026 Israel's educational network \u2013 regardless of the political persuasions of faculty \u2013 is already entrenched in the occupation.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>One example is the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, a university with an international reputation for research \u2013 and <a href=\"http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/02/06/lse-new-concerns-over-human-rights/\" title=\"\">strong ties with the Israeli military and arms manufacturers</a>.</p> <p>Technion's scientists have <a href=\"http://pard.technion.ac.il/archives/PressEng.NotActive/Pdf/PR_d-9Eng_20_10.pdf\" title=\"\">developed</a> a <a href=\"http://twitpic.com/8gdw1q\" title=\"\">remote-controlled bulldozer</a> used to demolish Palestinian homes, with the university offering <a href=\"http://www.admin.technion.ac.il/President/Eng/President%27s%20Report%202011_FINAL.pdf\" title=\"\">\"tailored\" programmes to the \"IDF [Israel Defence Forces] and Ministry of Defense\"</a>.</p> <p>Technion also has a <a href=\"http://ir.elbitsystems.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=61849&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1376090&amp;highlight\" title=\"\">close relationship</a> with companies like Elbit Systems \u2013 a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/23/gaza-war-crimes-allegations-drones\" title=\"\">drone manufacturer</a> targeted for divestment around the world due to its involvement in <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/u-s-pension-fund-giant-confirms-divestment-from-israel-firm-1.8029\" title=\"\">\"violations of international humanitarian law\"</a>.</p> <p>Finally, it is revealing that Caplan also omits to mention that it is occupied and colonised Palestinians who are asking for a boycott as one tactic in a campaign for basic rights.</p> <p><a href=\"http://pacbi.org/etemplate.php?id=868\" title=\"\">The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel</a> was launched in 2004, and helped to start the BDS campaign the year after. PACBI urges <a href=\"http://www.pacbi.org/etemplate.php?id=1108\" title=\"\">a boycott</a> to be applied in ways such as refraining from \"collaboration or joint projects with Israeli institutions\". It is nothing to do with, as Caplan incorrectly claims, \"excluding someone because of his or her government's views\".</p> <p>As with South Africa, those suffering under policies of <a href=\"http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/03/21/israel-segregation-discrimination-and-forced-displacement/\" title=\"\">segregation and forced displacement</a> are urging boycott campaigns as a means of ending Israel's impunity and realising their basic rights.</p> <p>BDS makes the link between Israeli crimes and a response to them: the kind of nonviolent, grassroots campaign that has long been used to challenge injustice. Academia is not exempt.</p>",

  "<p>On the 14 August, Jon Taylor wrote a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2012/aug/14/philisophical-teaching-students\">blog piece</a> for the Guardian Teacher Network in praise of the Socratic method, and its application in teaching. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17674960\">comments</a> on the article (perhaps predictably) focused on the lack of any form of assessment for rational thought, or the ability to assess critical thinking as a skill within the framework of most subjects. But the truth is, critical thinking and teaching through the Socratic method have been around for donkey's years. Why then are they not used and recognised?</p> <p>One of the most overused quotes in any liberal teacher's hymn book is that the majority of jobs our students will work in their adult lives, have yet to be invented. This is often used as a lynchpin for the teacher to justify their avant-garde teaching techniques (the same ones that come up every five years) that are politely indulged by line managers as a harmless exercise in career development, before their results come in under target, and they get on with the serious business of getting the students to pass the exams.</p> <p>And herein lies the problem. The same problem that education has been ignoring like the increasingly large elephant in the room for the past 20 years. Schools are businesses (now so more than ever, as they balance their books one playing field at a time) and the bottom line is league tables. If not nationally, then locally. A* to C pass rates that can be printed in 72 point text in promotional literature, attracting parents, their darling children, and with it the pupil premium.</p> <p>By contrast, critical thinking as a subject has been around in schools for many years. It was brought in as a replacement to the brilliantly terrible general studies in the hope that students might get something specific and useful, rather than well, general. And with the speed at which the world is developing, the need for the ability to rationalise argument, and synthesising new information into a cogent, reflective and logical action is surely at a paramount, not to mention the core of a teacher's purpose?</p> <p>Well \u2013 yes and no. Yes, in theory, but here's the thing. Universities hate critical thinking. The overwhelming majority do not offer UCAS points for grades in critical thinking. Durham Law School give the wonderfully <a href=\"http://www.dur.ac.uk/law/undergraduate/apply/admissionsfaq/?faqno=1483\">vague claim</a> that \"it is hoped that evidence of a student's critical abilities will be found in their past and predicted examination performances\", and while Oxbridge say they like to see it on an application, they offer no accreditation to the exam either. </p> <p>This dunderheaded decision has lead to a domino effect in secondary education. If a school's primary purpose is to generate pass rates and percentages into higher education (and it currently is, like it or not), then why devote staff to critical thinking? Let it fill up part-time staff's timetables, or pad out that under scheduled music teacher's day. Motivated students question what the point is to the subject, and while I would love to explain to them its long term importance, at 17, with a stack of English essays and biology research to write up, all of which has a concrete pay-off in a year's time, even they struggle to see the benefits.

  "<p>As anxiety around high and volatile food prices grows, global hunger is again prominent on the international agenda. Later this month, <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/09/11/g20-mexico-idINL1E8KBD9J20120911\" title=\"\">G20 officials meeting in Mexico City</a> will discuss global action to tackle food price spikes. On Tuesday, French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said he is trying to persuade world leaders to set up <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/09/11/uk-france-grain-hollande-idUKBRE88A17320120911\" title=\"\">strategic stockpiles of agricultural commodities</a> as a buffer against extreme price swings. In October, the UN is expected to release <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/jan/26/global-hunger-fao-figures-add-up\" title=\"\">revised estimates</a> of how many people go to bed hungry each night.</p> <p>The Guardian is currently hosting an exhibition by photographer <a href=\"http://gideonmendel.com/\" title=\"\">Gideon Mendel</a>, who visited four schemes run by <a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en\" title=\"\">Concern Worldwide</a> in northern Kenya, where many of the poorest families spend up to 80% of their income on food. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2012/sep/12/tackling-hunger-kenya-in-pictures?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">This collection of photos</a> helps capture the human dimension of the ongoing battle against hunger.</p> <p>Teso Diba lives in the dusty and barren settlement of Sahgel, around 18 miles from the mountains of Marsabit in northern Kenya. She faces a daily struggle to provide food for her children. Teso and her family are pastoralists who herd livestock and rely on their animals for food and income, but poor rainfall has depleted the herd and the remaining animals are weak and hard to sell.</p> <p>Diba's four-year-old son is being treated for severe malnutrition in Concern's outreach nutrition programme. \"My son Umuro started losing weight and getting sick, and I knew it was because I didn't have enough food in the house,\" she says. \"When Concern arrived at the village, they asked if I wanted to have my children checked and weighed and I was glad someone was seeing him finally. Now he is in the programme he is getting better and stronger, but food has really become a problem for us lately.\"</p> <p>Another programme featured in the exhibition aims to combat the effects of drought, one of the toughest problems the pastoralists have to face. A micro-irrigation project in Madowadi, a small settlement in northern Kenya by the Ethiopian border, 430 miles from Nairobi, provides pastoralists with an alternative livelihood. The programme participants are Borana \u2013 a pastoral people who have lost most of their animals to drought.</p> <p>The micro-irrigation project has now been running for two years. Before it was set up, people had to cut down trees for wood to use in construction projects, or for charcoal \u2013 hazardous work, because it is illegal to cut down the trees for charcoal. They would have to wait, entering the towns and villages when the ministry men were gone, or selling the fruits of their labour on the road outside.</p> <p>The micro-irrigation programme set up by Concern and its local partner, <a href=\"http://www.cifakenya.org/\" title=\"\">Community Initiative Facilitation and Assistance</a> (Cifa), has helped transform this settlement into an oasis of green in a usually dry landscape, providing the community with new sources of food. There are 30 households in the programme and each has a plot.</p> <p>From dawn to dusk, Jillo Dabassa, one of the programme's participants, works on her plot. \"I was divorced and left with with children, and I had to find a way of making a living,\" she says. \"I burned charcoal and borrowed money. I was looked down on in the village and no one helped me out. Then Cifa came to my community. They introduced me to farming and gave me training.\"</p> <p>Water is pumped from a pan built by Cifa and directed to tiny holes 20cm apart in plastic pipes. Plants are placed exactly where the water drips out, ensuring that the water seeps gently but effectively into the roots. Tomatoes, onions and kale are flourishing. The goal is to protect the community protect against the shock of future droughts, and building resilience is a key aim . Anne O'Mahony, Concern's country director, says: \"The problem that many of the most vulnerable people face is the uncertainty of how they will provide for their families. There are so many factors that are outside of their control. We are working out ways that address their immediate needs but, more importantly, enable people to secure their own stable futures. \"</p> <p>The exhibition, Four Stories about Hunger, is on until Thursday 20 September 2012 at the Guardian Gallery, Kings Place, London N1.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Chris Elliott is the Guardian's readers' editor and a trustee of </em><a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en\" title=\"\"><em>Concern Worldwide</em></a><em> (UK).

  "<p>The man who has <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2200948/Juror-tells-judge-try-cases-extreme-views.html\" title=\"\">got off jury service at Southampton crown court</a> chose a disconcerting way of doing so. Having been shortlisted to be a juror in a trial for assault and dangerous driving, he wrote to the judge brazenly asserting his unfitness for the task: \"I hold extreme prejudices against homosexuals and black/foreign people and couldn't possibly be impartial if either appeared in court.\"</p> <p>He undermined his position by adding that he would be so keen to see the case concluded, he would simply vote with the majority anyway and not give his true opinion. This rather implied that he wouldn't let his prejudices, however extreme, hold back the jury from reaching a speedy verdict.</p> <p>Even so, the judge was in a dilemma. On the one hand, such a blatant lack of tolerance might well seem to disqualify a person from sitting in judgment on a fellow citizen. On the other, it was quite possible the man had presented himself in this obnoxious light purely as a ruse for getting out of jury service. Judge Burrell questioned the man about the sincerity of his beliefs but, with no satisfactory result. He was dismissed \u2013 though with the threat of a possible prosecution for contempt of court hanging over him.</p> <p>If he were indeed prosecuted, it would not be for being \"honest\" about his prejudices. It would be for deceiving the court into rejecting him as a juror. After all, if claiming to be a racist or a homophobe or the holder of any kind of extreme view came to be seen as a way of dodging a jury summons, thousands would be at it.</p> <p>Not so long ago, it was a gaping flaw in the jury system that all manner of well-heeled folk were either exempt altogether or could easily wriggle out of doing jury service by claiming they were needed at the office or had a skiing holiday booked. The consequence was a widespread perception, especially among the chattering and jury-dodging classes, that juries were entirely peopled by the feckless, the illiterate and the unemployed.</p> <p>Some years ago I was a juryman on a long kidnap trial at the Old Bailey. Journalist colleagues thought I was insane not to have got out of it, which I easily could have. I was glad I hadn't. The experience <a href=\"http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-jurymans-tale-9780747545583\" title=\"\">inspired a book about the jury system</a> in which I made it something of a mission to urge the ending of this middle-class opt-out, so that juries might indeed represent all walks of life.</p> <p>In 2004, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jun/17/politics.politicalnews\" title=\"\">things changed</a>. Now everyone must do jury service, even policemen and high court judges, unless they have compelling reasons to be excused. Jury service is legally recognised as a civic duty for all, irrespective of class, profession, religion or race \u2013 which is as it should be, and which brings us back to the Southampton man and his self-proclaimed prejudices. I think the judge was wrong to dismiss him.</p> <p>Any randomly picked jury may include people with uncommon or unfashionable views, or extreme political opinions. Some will be outspoken about their prejudices, typically against the police or immigrants. Some have religious reasons for not wishing to be judgmental at all. How could it be otherwise? And if these people have the right to vote, even for the BNP, surely it should not be otherwise.</p> <p>That is the beauty of a tribunal of 12 men and women. Common sense nearly always prevails. In my own experience and that of former jurors I have spoken to, juries take their responsibilities enormously seriously. They try very hard to live up to their oath to \"faithfully try the defendant and give a true verdict according to the evidence\". The bigots and extremists tend to be out-argued or out-voted \u2013 if needs be by a majority verdict. It's a fair bet that if the Southampton man had been allowed to sit, his unpleasant views, if genuine, would have turned the other jurors against him.</p> <p>Serious challenges face the jury system, especially the risk of jurors <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jan/23/juror-contempt-court-online-research\" title=\"\">researching their cases</a> in mid-trial on Google or even Facebooking a defendant, as we have recently seen. But this was no such threat. Judge Burrell should have shown more confidence that the jury system could neutralise a nutter. It does so all the time.</p>",
  "<p>Today the Bishop of Liverpool, the Rt Reverend James Jones, is publishing the report of the Hillsborough Independent Panel.</p> <p>The disaster at the Hillsborough football stadium on 15 April 1989 was one of the greatest peacetime tragedies of the last century. Ninety-six people died as a result of a crush in the Leppings Lane Terrace at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.</p> <p>There was a public inquiry at the time by Lord Justice Taylor which found \u2013 and I quote \u2013 that the main cause of the disaster was \"a failure of police control\".</p> <p>But the inquiry didn't have access to all the documents that have since become available. It didn't properly examine the response of the emergency services. It was followed by a deeply controversial inquest and by a media version of events that sought to blame the fans.</p> <p>As a result, the families have not heard the truth and have not found justice. That is why the previous government \u2013 and in particular \u2013 the Rt Hon Member for Leigh was right to set up this panel. And it is why this government insisted that no stone should be left unturned and that all papers should be made available to the Bishop of Liverpool and his team.</p> <p>Mr Speaker, in total over 450,000 pages of evidence have been reviewed. It was right that the families should see the report first. As a result, the government has only had a very limited amount of time to study the evidence so far.</p> <p>But it is already very clear that many of the report's findings are deeply distressing.</p> <p>There are three areas in particular. The failure of the authorities to help protect people. The attempt to blame the fans. And the doubt cast on the original coroner's inquest. Let me take each in turn.</p> <p>First, there is new evidence about how the authorities failed. There is a trail of new documents which show the extent to which the safety of the crowd at Hillsborough was \"compromised at every level\". The ground failed to meet minimum standards and the \"deficiencies were well known\". The turnstiles were inadequate. The ground capacity had been significantly over-calculated. The crush barriers failed to meet safety standards. There had been a crush at exactly the same match the year before. And today's report shows clearly that lessons had not been learnt.</p> <p>The report backs up again the key finding of the Taylor Report on police failure. But it goes further by revealing for the first time the shortcomings of the ambulance and emergency services' response. The major incident plan was not fully implemented. Rescue attempts were held back by failures of leadership and co-ordination. And, significantly, new documents today show there was a delay from the emergency services when people were being crushed and killed.</p> <p>Second, the families have long believed that some of the authorities attempted to create a completely unjust account of events that sought to blame the fans for what happened. Mr Speaker, the families were right.</p> <p>The evidence in today's report includes briefings to the media and attempts by the police to change the record of events. On the media: several newspapers reported false allegations that fans were drunk and violent and stole from the dead. The Sun's report sensationalised these allegations under a banner headline, \"The Truth\". This was clearly wrong and caused huge offence, distress and hurt.</p> <p>News International has co-operated with the panel and, for the first time, today's report reveals that the source for these despicable untruths was a Sheffield news agency reporting conversations with South Yorkshire police and Irvine Patnick, the then MP for Sheffield Hallam.</p> <p>The report finds that this was part of police efforts \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \"to develop and publicise a version of events that focused on \u2026 allegations of drunkenness, ticketlessness and violence.\" In terms of changing the record of events, we already know that police reports were significantly altered but the full extent was not drawn to Lord Justice Taylor's attention.</p> <p>Today's report finds that 164 statements were significantly amended \u2013 and 116 explicitly removed negative comments about the policing operation \u2013 including its lack of leadership.</p> <p>The report also makes important findings about particular actions taken by the police and coroner while investigating the deaths. There is new evidence which shows that police officers carried out police national computer checks on those who had died in an attempt \u2013 and I quote from the report \u2013 \"to impugn the reputations of the deceased.\"</p> <p>The coroner took blood alcohol levels from all of the deceased including children. The panel finds no rationale whatsoever for what it regards as an \"exceptional\" decision. The report states clearly that the attempt of the inquest to draw a link between blood alcohol and late arrival was \"fundamentally flawed\". And that alcohol consumption was \"unremarkable and not exceptional for a social or leisure occasion\".</p> <p>Mr Speaker, over all these years questions have been raised about the role of the government \u2013 including whether it did enough to uncover the truth. It is certainly true that some of the language in the government papers published today was insensitive. But having been through every document \u2013 and every government document including cabinet minutes will be published \u2014 the panel found no evidence of any government trying to conceal the truth.</p> <p>At the time of the Taylor Report, the then Prime Minister was briefed by her private secretary that the defensive and \u2013 I quote \u2013 \"close to deceitful\" behaviour of senior South Yorkshire officers was \"depressingly familiar\". And it is clear that the then government thought it right that the chief constable of South Yorkshire should resign. But as the Rt Hon Member for Leigh has rightly highlighted, governments then and since have simply not done enough to challenge publicly the unjust and untrue narrative that sought to blame the fans.</p> <p>Third, and perhaps most significantly of all, the Bishop of Liverpool's report presents new evidence which casts significant doubt over the adequacy of the original inquest. The coroner \u2013 on the advice of pathologists \u2013 believed that victims suffered traumatic asphyxia leading to unconsciousness within seconds and death within a few minutes. As a result he asserted that beyond 3.15pm there were no actions that could have changed the fate of the victims and he limited the scope of the inquest accordingly.</p> <p>But by analysing postmortem reports the panel have found that 28 did not have obstruction of blood circulation and 31 had evidence of heart and lungs continuing to function after the crush. This means that individuals in those groups could have had potentially reversible asphyxia beyond 3.15pm in contrast to the findings of the coroner and a subsequent judicial review. And the panel states clearly that \"it is highly likely that what happened to those individuals after 3.15pm was significant\" in determining whether they died.</p> <p>Mr Speaker, the conclusions of this report will be harrowing for many of the families affected. Anyone who has lost a child knows the pain never leaves you. But to read a report years afterwards that says \u2013 and I quote\u2013 \"a swifter, more appropriate, better focused and properly equipped response had the potential to save more lives\" can only add to the pain.</p> <p>It is for the attorney general to decide whether to apply to the high court to quash the original inquest and seek a new one. In this capacity he acts independently of government. And he will need to examine the evidence himself. But it is clear to me that the new evidence in today's report raises vital questions which must be examined. And the attorney general has assured me that he will examine this new evidence immediately and reach a decision as fast as possible. But ultimately it is for the high court to decide.</p> <p>It is also right that the house should have an opportunity to debate the issues raised in this report fully. My Rt Hon friend the home secretary will be taking forward a debate in government time. And this will happen when the house returns in October.</p> <p>Mr Speaker, I want to be very clear about the view the government takes about these findings and why after 23 years this matters so much, not just for the families but for Liverpool and for our country as a whole. Mr Speaker what happened that day \u2013 and since \u2013 was wrong. It was wrong that the responsible authorities knew Hillsborough did not meet minimum safety standards and yet still allowed the match to go ahead. It was wrong that the families have had to wait for so long \u2013 and fight so hard \u2013 just to get to the truth. And it was wrong that the police changed the records of what happened and tried to blame the fans.</p> <p>We ask the police to do difficult and often very dangerous things on our behalf. And South Yorkshire police is a very different organisation today from what it was then. But we do the many, many honourable police men and women a great disservice if we try to defend the indefensible.</p> <p>It was also wrong that neither Lord Justice Taylor nor the coroner looked properly at the response of the other emergency services. Again, these are dedicated people who do extraordinary things to serve the public.</p> <p>But the evidence from today's report makes very difficult reading.</p> <p>Mr Speaker, with the weight of the new evidence in this report, it is right for me today as prime minister to make a proper apology to the families of the 96 for all they have suffered over the past 23 years. Indeed, the new evidence that we are presented with today makes clear that these families have suffered a double injustice. The injustice of the appalling events \u2013 the failure of the state to protect their loved ones and the indefensible wait to get to the truth. And the injustice of the denigration of the deceased \u2013 that they were somehow at fault for their own deaths.</p> <p>On behalf of the government \u2013 and indeed our country \u2013 I am profoundly sorry for this double injustice that has been left uncorrected for so long.</p> <p>Mr Speaker, because of what I have described as the second injustice \u2013 the false version of events \u2013 not enough people in this country understand what the people of Merseyside have been through. This appalling death toll of so many loved ones lost was compounded by an attempt to blame the victims. A narrative about hooliganism on that day was created which led many in the country to accept that it was somehow a grey area. Today's report is black and white. The Liverpool fans \"were not the cause of the disaster\".</p> <p>The panel has quite simply found \"no evidence\" in support of allegations of \"exceptional levels of drunkenness, ticketlessness or violence among Liverpool fans\", \"no evidence that fans had conspired to arrive late at the stadium\" and \"no evidence that they stole from the dead and dying\".</p> <p>Mr Speaker, I'm sure the whole house will want to thank the Bishop of Liverpool and his panel for all the work they have done. And I am sure that all sides will join with me in paying tribute to the incredible strength and dignity of the Hillsborough families and the community which has backed them in their long search for justice.</p> <p>While nothing can ever bring back those who have been lost with all the documents revealed and nothing held back the families, at last, have access to the truth. And I commend this statement to the house.</p>",
  "<p>Our dear friend Clover Graham, who has been murdered in Jamaica aged 56, was a lawyer, human rights activist and since 1998 honorary liaison in Jamaica to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).</p> <p>Born in Portland, Jamaica, she joined her father in Britain when she was six. She prospered academically, gaining undergraduate and postgraduate degrees from Kingston University and the London School of Economics as she pursued a career in law.</p> <p>Clover developed a political and social consciousness through study and voluntary work, beginning with her campaign at Norwood girls' school in south London to have the histories and achievements of black people reflected in the curriculum. She continued this work, through participation in the Brixton Black Women's group, supporting poor young mothers in the Mary Seacole craft group as they moved towards economic and psychological independence and through her unstinting support for Sabarr Books in Brixton \u2013 the first volunteer-run black bookshop in south London.</p> <p>On qualifying as a lawyer, she worked at Brixton Community Law Centre, defending the black community against discrimination. She preferred to work quietly and painstakingly behind the scenes. At a particularly difficult time, during the first Brixton uprising in 1981, she contributed to the acquittal of many defendants.</p> <p>In 1990 Clover decided she could make a greater contribution in Jamaica, continuing the work started in the UK. She worked at the legal aid clinic of the Norman Manley Law School in Kingston; lectured at the University of Technology on land law, a critical aspect of a young country's development; and worked with the UNHCR.</p> <p>All her work reflected a life in law, and most importantly in service to others \u2013 devoted to the defence of the marginalised and the dispossessed. Clover was first diagnosed with cancer in 2001, and it returned seven years later. In 2007 her son, Taiwo, was murdered in St Andrew, Jamaica. Nevertheless, she lived without bitterness and encouraged others to do so.</p> <p>She is survived by her husband, Rex McKenzie, whom she married in 1984, and two daughters, Arusha and Zakiya.</p>",
  "<p>Defence sources have dismissed as \"political posturing\" reports that soldiers will be deployed as strike-breakers.</p> <p>The military has in the past been brought in to cover for strikers, most recently in the fire service, but has done so specifically to ensure public safety. There is no appetite for troops to cover for immigration workers or tube drivers, for example, as reports suggested.</p> <p>One official source described the suggestion as \"not realistic\". Another said any proposal to bring in troops in areas not related to public safety but, for example, to prop up the economy would be entirely new territory.</p> <p>The contingency plans, said to have been discussed by David Cameron and the Cabinet Office minister, Francis Maude, appear to have come as a surprise to the Ministry of Defence.</p> <p>Officials pointed out that apart from the fire service, other groups that could have an impact on public safety, including prison officers and the police, were prevented from taking strike action.</p> <p>Ministers appear to have been impressed by the way the military came in to help control entry into Olympic venues after the failure of the private security company G4S to recruit and train sufficient people. But this was an informal, entirely voluntary arrangement.</p> <p>The Fire Brigades Union has warned the government that using soldiers as a replacement public sector workforce in the event of co-ordinated mass strikes risks politicising the army.</p> <p>The FBU's general secretary, Matt Wrack, said reports of creating an auxiliary workforce to mitigate walkouts would not be welcomed by members of the armed forces who were also facing redundancies and spending cuts. \"It starts to politicise the role of the armed forces in relation to political and industrial matters,\" said Wrack.</p> <p>He added: \"It's provocative, especially after they have made hundreds if not thousands of service people redundant, suffering the same austerity cuts as anyone else. I suspect armed forces personnel themselves may not be too happy about it.\"</p> <p>The report in the Times of a government strike contingency strategy emerged as the annual Trades Union Congress in Brighton carried a motion calling on the union umbrella body to consider the practicalities of calling a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/11/tuc-to-consider-general-strike\" title=\"\">general strike</a>. A day earlier the TUC carried a motion calling for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/10/tuc-public-sector-strikes-pay\" title=\"\">co-ordinated action</a> over public sector pay restraint, a scenario viewed as much more likely than a general strike.</p> <p>The TUC general secretary, Brendan Barber, who has played down the chances of a general strike, also warned that involving the armed forces in strike contingencies would politicise the army. \"The government should concentrate on resolving issues through negotiation, not through the provocative use of troops as strike-breakers,\" he said. \"It is hard to think that the armed services would be happy to used in this highly political way. It would mark the UK out from other similar advanced democracies.\"</p> <p>Help provided by the armed forces in the event of emergencies and threats to public safety are governed by Military Aid to the Civil Authorities (Maca), a term that contains specific criteria relating to maintenance of law, order and public safety. They include the principle that military intervention should always be the last resort and that the need for the military to act is urgent. Maca includes disarming unexploded bombs, air-sea rescue and mountain rescue.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Prime Minister said: \"Of course we have contingency plans in place. Clearly I'm not going to comment on specifics of our contingency plans but those plans have not changed. Those plans are designed to take action over a range of scenarios. But the main point here is we do not think strike action is appropriate: it won't benefit anyone, we are not intending to re-open negotiations on pay and pensions, which have already been settled.\"</p> <p>A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: \"National contingency arrangements are a matter for the Cabinet Office. Established procedures for the provision of military assistance to the civilian authorities exist, which are tried and tested and were employed during both the recent Olympic Games and in preparation for a possible fuel strike earlier this year. These have not changed.\"</p>",

He said: \"With the weight of the new evidence in the report it's right for me today as prime minister to make a proper apology to the families of the 96 \u2026 On behalf of the government, and indeed of our country, I am profoundly sorry that this double injustice has been left uncorrected for so long.\"</p> <p>The report by the Hillsborough independent panel, established three years ago and chaired by the bishop of Liverpool, James Jones, found that there was a failure of authorities to protect people and an attempt to blame fans.</p> <p>The panel concluded that the main cause of the Hillsborough disaster was a \"failure in police control\" but also revealed \"multiple failures\" within other organisations that compromised crowd safety. It underlined the \"clear operational failure\" that led to the disaster and the attempts by South Yorkshire police (SYP) and the ambulance service to cover up their shortcomings. The fact that the ambulance service also altered statements from staff is revealed for the first time. The evidence shows \"conclusively\" that Liverpool fans \"neither caused nor contributed to the deaths\" and shows the extent to which attempts, endorsed by the South Yorkshire chief constable Peter Wright, were made to smear them.</p> <p>Documents released to the panel show how high-ranking police sources, the South Yorkshire Police Federation and the Tory MP Irvine Patnick were responsible for feeding the stories to Whites News Agency in Yorkshire.</p> <p>They led to the infamous Sun headline \"The Truth\" that led to a longstanding boycott of the paper in Liverpool.</p> <p>\"The Police Federation, supported informally by the SYP chief constable, sought to develop and publicise a version of events derived in police officers' allegations of drunkenness, ticketless fans and violence. This extended beyond the media to parliament,\" said the panel.\"From the mass of documents, television and CCTV coverage disclosed to the panel there is no evidence to support these allegations other than a few isolated examples of aggressive or verbally abusive behaviour clearly reflecting frustration and desperation. The vast majority of fans on the pitch assisted in rescuing and evacuating the dead and injured.\"</p> <p>The panel found that 164 police statements were significantly amended and 116 explicitly removed negative comments about the policing operation, including its lack of leadership, a revelation that drew gasps when relayed by Cameron in parliament. Officers carried out police national computer checks on those who had died in an attempt \"to impugn the reputations of the deceased\" and the coroner took blood alcohol levels from all of the deceased, including children. The panel found that close analysis of the documents demonstrated that the weight placed on blood alcohol levels was inappropriate, fuelling \"persistent and unsustainable assertions about drunken fan behaviour not supported by evidence of moderate patterns of drinking unremarkable for a leisure event.\"</p> <p>Documents disclosed to the panel also reveal that the original pathologists' evidence of a single unvarying pattern of death is unsustainable. The assumption was the basis of a coroner's imposition of a 3.15pm cut-off on evidence to the inquests. It led to the mistaken belief that an effective emergency service intervention could not have saved lives. The panel's disclosure confirms that in some cases death was not immediate and the outcome depended on events after 3.15pm.</p> <p>Dr Bill Kirkup, from the panel, said at a press conference at the Anglican cathedral in Liverpool that 41 of the victims had \"potential to survive\", although he could not say for sure how many could have been saved.</p> <p>Cameron said it would be for the attorney general to decide whether to apply to the high court to quash the original inquest and seek a new one, as the families are demanding. But he added that it was clear \"today's report raises vital questions which must be examined\".</p> <p>The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, made his own apology for his party not doing more to uncover the truth during its 13 years in office from 1997 to 2010. \"We on this side also apologise to the families that we didn't do enough to help,\" he said. A succession of MPs called for legal action against those responsible for the failures that led to the tragedy or who were involved in the subsequent cover-up, variously suggesting that proceedings should be brought for defamation, misconduct in public office and perverting the course of justice.</p> <p>More than 23 years after 96 men, women and children died in the Leppings Lane end of the ground on 15 April 1989, the families of those who died gave the panel a standing ovation in Liverpool Cathedral as it delivered its findings. \"For nearly a quarter of a century the families of the 96 and the survivors of Hillsborough have nursed an open wound waiting for answers to unresolved questions. It has been a frustrating and painful experience adding to their grief. In spite of all the investigations they have sensed that their search for truth and justice has been thwarted and that no one has been held accountable,\" said Jones. \"The documents disclosed to and analysed by the panel show that the tragedy should never have happened. There were clear operational failures in response to the disaster and in its aftermath there were strenuous attempts to deflect the blame on to the fans. The panel's detailed report shows how vulnerable victims, survivors and their families are when transparency and accountability are compromised.\"</p> <p>Sheila Coleman of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign welcomed Cameron's apology. She told BBC Radio 4's World at One that the inquest verdicts \"have to be quashed\" and that criminal charges should be brought \"because all the evidence today shows that South Yorkshire police and people in South Yorkshire police lied and operated a cover-up.\"</p>",
  "<p>Public support for the war in Afghanistan is collapsing in western and Nato member countries, with 53% of Europeans and 44% of Americans favouring the immediate withdrawal of all troops, an <a href=\"http://trends.gmfus.org/\" title=\"\">international survey</a> shows.</p> <p>Large majorities \u2013 75% of European respondents and 68% of Americans \u2013 support either withdrawal or an immediate troop reduction, according to the annual transatlantic trends survey conducted by the German Marshall Fund of the United States.</p> <p>In each of the top European Nato members supplying troops in Afghanistan, the majority of respondents preferred complete withdrawal: Germany (51%), the UK (52%), Italy (55%), France (61%), and Poland (62%).</p> <p>The number of Americans who preferred increasing troop levels in Afghanistan shrank from 30% in 2009 to 5% this year, and the proportion wanting immediate withdrawal rose nine points in a year, from 35% in 2011.</p> <p>The findings come amid worries that the security situation in Afghanistan is deteriorating after a spate of lethal attacks on coalition troops by members of the Afghan army and police, and continuing casualties among Afghan civilians.</p> <p>Under present plans, the US and British governments are committed to handing over security control to Afghan forces and withdrawing their troops by 2014. Little substantive progress has been made in peace talks with the Taliban, despite numerous initiatives in the past two years.</p> <p>The survey found a sharp increase in public doubts about the prospects for a successful outcome in Afghanistan: 56% of Americans said they were pessimistic and 38% optimistic, an almost exact reversal of the findings two years ago. On average, 70% of Europeans were gloomy about the conflict, with the French (84%) and the Germans (81%) the most pessimistic of all.</p> <p>The survey reveals that public opinion on both sides of the Atlantic is split on the overall wisdom of military intervention. Fewer than 50% of people in most European countries believed the Iraq and Afghanistan interventions were worthwhile. Even last year's Libya Nato intervention, which was judged successful at the time, received very mixed support.</p> <p>The survey found very little support for military action against Iran to halt its suspected nuclear programme. Only 7% of people in the EU preferred military action over all other options, and 34% preferred offering economic incentives to Tehran to abandon the programme.</p> <p>In the US, 32% preferred economic sanctions. American public support for the Obama administration's policy of helping the Iranian opposition fell sharply from 25% in 2010 to 10% in 2012, closely matching the European figure of 13%.</p> <p>When respondents were given an either-or choice between accepting a nuclear-armed Iran or using military force to prevent it, opinion shifted significantly. In Europe, 46% said they would support military action, and in the US 57%. But resistance to an attack on Iran was high even in this scenario. In the UK 49% of people said they would prefer to accept a nuclear-armed Iran rather than go to war.</p> <p>When those who said they would support military action against Iran were asked whether they also supported their own country's involvement, or the use of their country's ground troops, enthusiasm for an attack ebbed even further.</p> <p>Large majorities on both sides of the Atlantic agreed with the proposition that the international community has a responsibility to protect civilians against violence by their own government. But this sentiment did not translate into strong support for western military intervention in Syria, the survey found. Roughly one in three respondents in the US, Europe and Turkey backed the idea of intervention in Syria. Majorities in Europe (59%), the US (55%) and Turkey (57%) said their countries should stay out of the conflict completely.</p> <p>\u2022 The German Marshall Fund of the United States transatlantic trends survey interviewed people in the US, Russia and Turkey and 12 European countries in June this year.</p>",

Surprised? Our rhetoric on equality rarely matches our delivery.</p> <p>Recent upbeat reactions to the sporting summer only highlight our collective amnesia about the persistent patterns of racial inequality that mean that while we have taken Mo Farah to our national heart, if he chose to apply for an office job he would still have to make nearly twice as many applications to a similarly qualified Greg Rutherford to even get an interview simply because his name is identifiably Somali.</p> <p>Phillips, as head of the equality superquango, was always bound to be caught in this rhetorical gap. He can rightly be proud of the commission's work to embed the Race Relations Amendment Act and its successor Equality Act \u2013 turning 30,000 public institutions into activists for equality on his watch, and providing a focus on outcomes rather than the soft soap of \"celebrating diversity\". He will be disheartened at the ease with which the current government has dismissed such progress as mere red tape.</p> <p>Perhaps a marker of his success is the current fervour with which the EHRC is being dismantled. When a high-profile, media-savvy commentator, was appointed to the Commission for Racial Equality and then the EHRC, there was always the danger that opponents of equality would seek to play the man and not the ball. There were times when Phillips became the story. His legacy, however, is a greater honesty about the limits of government intervention in this area and more widespread realisation that solving our racism problem cannot simply be outsourced to a government agency.</p> <p>\u2022 Rob Berkeley is director of the Runnymede Trust</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/sandra-kerr\" title=\"\">Sandra Kerr</a>: 'This is a call to action for politicians'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396035642\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/12/1347451818934/Sandra-Kerr.jpg\" alt=\"Sandra Kerr\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>On his departure, Trevor Phillips wrote a letter to his staff highlighting their successes and reminding them of the challenges ahead.

What was a priority 10 or five years ago is no more \u2013 we are now facing the unequal social impact of the economic downturn.</p> <p>The question to ask here isn't just \"What has Trevor Phillips done for us?\", but what have UK employers done to support him in his efforts to promote opportunity for all?</p> <p>As it stands, inequality continues and we need to collectively stand up to address this. Currently, only one in 16 of FTSE-100 board members are from a black, Asian or minority ethnic background.</p> <p>As Phillips said in his letter, what is needed is \"the sheer hard work of many people, inside and outside the EHRC, to change our country's sometimes grudging toleration of our differences into an enthusiastic celebration of our diversity\".</p> <p>This is a call to action for politicians, employers \u2013 public sector, private sector, multinationals and small- and medium-sized businesses \u2013 the media and individuals to do more and do better in driving organisational and cultural change.</p> <p>No one person can achieve this.

Couple that with having your budget slashed by half and losing more than half your staff and the job became an even greater challenge.</p> <p>Some may say that the media-savvy Phillips should have fought harder. While I agree he might have been more vocal, anyone who cared to look at our robust response to changes to the Commission and equality law could not doubt Phillips' commitment.</p> <p>When I joined the Commission three years ago I wasn't sure I could work with Phillips. We disagreed in many areas, not least around multiculturalism. I argued that Islamophobia, misguided imams and foreign policy lay behind the radicalisation of British Muslims, not the soft implementation of multiculturalism.</p> <p>But working with him I witnessed just how passionate he is about equality. Together we took on and beat the British National party, and convinced many within the police that racial profiling of stop and search would do more harm than good. We also encouraged the FA to stamp out racism and nurture black managers and, driven by Phillips, our conversation with big business has helped many see the business case for equality.</p> <p>\u2022 Simon Woolley is director of Operation Black Vote and a commissioner on the Equality and Human Rights Commission</p>",
  "<p>Tony Blair seems to lead a double life, one as a hunted fugitive, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/02/tony-blair-iraq-war-desmond-tutu\" title=\"\">condemned by no less a commanding moral authority than Archbishop Desmond Tutu</a>, the other as a tanned and successful global statesman and deal-maker. Exactly a week after Tutu attacked him in the Observer he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/07/glencore-delay-xstrata-merger-vote\" title=\"\">popped up in this week's Sunday papers</a> helping to rescue the troubled $80bn mining mega-merger between Glencore and Xstrata.</p> <p>What's going on? Well, for one thing Blair is going on. His hair seems to be getting blonder but that could happen to anyone who spends much of the summer on the tennis court. According to reports, if the Glencore/Xstrata merger/takeover is completed \u2013 it's still in doubt \u2013 he may pick up $1m (\u00a3620,000) for work on the phone and a crucial session at Claridge's hotel.</p> <p>A handy addition to his fine collection of banknotes, it's all of a piece with the role the former prime minister has created for himself after being driven from office by Gordon Brown's cohorts in 2007, part businessman, part philanthropist \u2013 all those foundations for sport, faith and Africa \u2013 part roving statesman in the Middle East and elsewhere.</p> <p>He's made millions but, as I've written before, his friends sometimes warn him that he's spread himself too thinly and that he'll never make enough to be accepted on equal terms with the really rich. \"Do less better,\" they say, as some said in his heyday at No 10. I suspect it's not in his restless nature to be still or reflective for long.</p> <p>But all this goes on side-by-side with his parallel image as a fugitive from international justice, at least in the eyes of his detractors on both left and right, a very unholy and hardline alliance between a familiar chorus of America-bashers and the Blair-baiting Daily Mail tribe \u2013 John Pilger and Simon Heffer, Noam Chomsky and Stephen Glover, George Monbiot and Max Hastings. <a href=\"http://www.medialens.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=692:the-return-of-the-king-tony-blair-and-the-magically-disappearing-blood&amp;catid=25:alerts-2012&amp;Itemid=69\" title=\"\">Here's</a> a recent sample from MediaLens.</p> <p>Some of these people hate each other as much as they hate Blair (or the Tory ones hate David Cameron, for that matter), they're good haters and he's always in the Rolodex when there's a temporary shortage of targets and 1,000 words to write. Tutu's declared refusal to attend a conference where the man of blood was present was a cue for renewed attacks and speculations, including an imaginary \u2013 and rather improbable \u2013 account of Blair's future Old Bailey trial.</p> <p>The 2,000-word hatchet job was written for the Mail by a thriller writer called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cain_(author)\" title=\"\">Tom Cain</a> who turns out to be a recycled version of the fiftysomething Fleet Street journalist David Thomas. Hang on to the day job, David.</p> <h2>Aggression</h2> <p>No less a figure than the Guardian's own George Monbiot took time off from his day job guarding planet Earth from its despoilers to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/03/tony-blair-the-hague-iraq-war\" title=\"\">persuade loyal readers</a> that Tutu's pronouncement had helped \"de-normalise\" Blair and made more likely an eventual appearance in some foreign court charged with crimes of aggression in breach of international law. <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/2009/10/26/arresting-blair/\" title=\"\">Here's</a> an earlier version.</p> <p>No, I don't ever expect this to happen, nor do I think it should. But I usually find the formidable Monbiot's arguments stimulating even when I disagree with them. Like William Rees-Mogg of the Times, a rather older curmudgeon, he illuminates the landscape in interesting and sometimes unpredictable ways \u2013 and can also admit to changing his mind, say on nuclear power or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/02/peak-oil-we-we-wrong\" title=\"\">peak oil</a>, which is a good virtue. Not everyone can do it.</p> <p>This year Monbiot has even <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/2012/05/21/see-no-evil/\" title=\"\">resumed combat</a> with his former hero <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky\" title=\"\">Noam Chomsky</a> over the familiar controversy surrounding the shameful 1995 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/srebrenica-massacre\" title=\"Guardian\">Srebrenica massacre</a>, a dangerous thing to do considering the militant cult that guards the old man.</p> <p>In this instance I fear GM is re-ploughing muddy ground on the Iraq war and that most of his key points are open to dispute in a pretty fundamental way \u2013 arguments with which most people are familiar. To take up one of them, after much shilly-shallying the then attorney general, Peter Goldsmith, assured the fateful cabinet on 17 March 2003 that military action against Saddam Hussein would be legal.</p> <p>I read that \u2013 again \u2013 in Peter Hain's new memoirs (Outside In, Biteback \u00a312.99) last week: I know what you're thinking, but Hain was present and uncomfortable. He has never been a pushover either \u2013 not since his high-profile, high-risk sports boycotting teens. Others present in cabinet have said the same.</p> <p>It's also not true that ministers knew Saddam didn't have weapons of mass destruction and lied about it. Whitehall and Washington persuaded themselves that he did \u2013 as Saddam wished them (and his own people) to believe. And so on. Did UNSCR 1441 authorise the use of force? Its crucial ambiguity will remain just that.</p> <p>There's little point in rehashing all this much-disputed territory, though I have been pleased to note lately that adamant assertions of a one-million-plus death toll in Iraq are becoming more tentative and now acknowledge the lower 100,000 estimates of the carnage. In due course it may be possible to acknowledge who did most of the killing in the quasi-civil war unleashed by Saddam's overthrow and the incompetent occupation strategy. Not Americans, I think.</p> <h2>Bounty</h2> <p>George Monbiot's passion to nail Blair has resulted in the very interesting <a href=\"http://www.arrestblair.org/\" title=\"\">ArrestBlair website</a> and the offer of bounty money, for which a <a href=\"http://hongwrong.com/arrest-blair-bounty/\" title=\"\">Hong Kong activist</a> was paid \u00a32,420 for a failed attempt to collar the ex-PM in June. The theory is that there are at least 25 states \u2013 and rising \u2013 which now incorporate the crime of aggression into their domestic law. Hope springs eternal.</p> <p>I suppose that this sort of campaign is admirable if you feel very strongly about something, but for those of us who don't it's puzzlingly selective. Why Iraq, a complex situation then as now, with few untainted good guys? Why not so many other grisly failures of statecraft, some of which cannot be laid at Blair's or George Bush's door?</p> <p>And why are some people so much keener than others to shoehorn events into their own preconceived value system \u2013 west always good/west always bad etc \u2013 when real life is usually much messier? Some veteran anti-apartheid campaigners were even puzzled by the redoubtable archbishop's attack on Blair at a time when targets closer to home \u2013 the Marikana mine massacre \u2013 looked more urgent.</p> <p>Perhaps they told him because he later <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/04/desmond-tutu-expresses-outrage-failing-politicians\" title=\"\">weighed in</a> on behalf of the striking miners and attacked his old ANC comrades, now in government. Good for him.</p> <p>But Blair remains an unusual example of a public figure with a very bifurcated status \u2013 both reviled and respected as only Margaret Thatcher has been on this scale in Britain's postwar politics and, in her case, the loathing is partisan, mostly from the left. Despite being Labour's great election winner \u2013 or is it because of it \u2013 Blair gets it in the neck from both sides but continues to lead his tanned and successful parallel life while his enemies fume.</p> <p>Puzzling. Yet it is far too soon to assess his place, if any, in the history of our times, both domestic and foreign. Why, only the other day I heard a well connected Arab suggest that yes, the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 had indeed been a trigger for the wave of democratic self-assertion now sweeping the Arab world with incalculable consequences. We'll see \u2013 and so will he.</p> <p>Meanwhile what has happened to the much-delayed Chilcot report, the latest doomed attempt to nail Blair for blame he doesn't deserve or widely shares (not least with the Tories)? It's now due next year, but don't hold your breath. Houdini's critics will not get their day in court.</p>",

Photograph: AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By way of background, Hayek was adamant that the central economic function of government is to organize and administer markets in such a way as to promote and protect competition. His central focus was on the neutrality of government rules \u2013 or what he called (on p117), \"the Rule of Law, in the sense of the rule of formal law, the absence of legal privileges of particular people designated by authority\" \u2013 not the elimination of government rules:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The liberal argument is in favor of making the best possible use of the forces of competition as a means of coordinating human efforts, not an argument for leaving things just as they are.\" (p85)</p> </blockquote> <p>Hayek emphasized that it is a pure and simple \u2013 and highly misleading \u2013 mischaracterization of his own thought, and of liberal economic theory, to suggest that government should do nothing. \"In no system that could be rationally defended would the state just do nothing\", he stressed in The Road to Serfdom (p88).</p> <p>In this sense, Hayek firmly believed that the notion of a \"free market\" is an illusion:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The question whether the state should or should not 'act' or 'interfere' poses an altogether false alternative, and the term 'laissez faire' is a highly ambiguous and misleading description of the principles on which a liberal policy is based. Of course, every state must act and every action of the state interferes with something or other.\" (p118)</p> </blockquote> <p>The key question for Hayek was whether the government rules are unbiased. Not that there be no rules, but that they be predictable and neutral \u2013 that they not favor the elites. So, for instance:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[W]ith respect to most of the general and permanent rules which the state may establish with regard to production, such as building regulations or factory laws: these may be wise or unwise in the particular instance, but they do not conflict with liberal principles so long as they are intended to be permanent and are not used to favor or harm particular people.\" (p118)</p> </blockquote> <p>Hayek's general theory of government was complex, and I am by no means a defender or a disciple. Personally, I believe that Hayek irrationally clung to a notion of natural order \u2013 what he called \"spontaneous order\" \u2013 that blinded him to the humanly-constructed nature of the wealth distributions that occur under conditions that he called \"competitive\". As a result, Hayek himself fell in the cold war trap, instead of working out the full implications of his own economic theory. Hayek made naturalistic assumptions in the economic realm \u2013 about the naturalness of skill and talent, and about natural order \u2013 that belong in churches and temples, not in political economy.</p> <p>But one thing is clear: as applied to the more specific issue of healthcare, Hayek favored a robust notion of security that included \"security against severe physical privation\" and \"the certainty of a given minimum of sustenance for all\" (p147). Hayek was adamant about this. \"There is no reason why in a society which has reached the general level of wealth which ours has attained,\" Hayek wrote, on the next page. \"[This] kind of security should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom.\" He continued, \"there can be no doubt that some minimum of food, shelter, and clothing, sufficient to preserve health and the capacity to work, can be assured to everybody.\" And for Hayek, this extended to healthcare: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Nor is there any reason why the state should not assist the individuals in providing for those common hazards of life against which, because of their uncertainty, few individuals can make adequate provision.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Hayek recognized that the provision of healthcare is complex and that we may disagree as to the exact structure of the assistance necessary:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"But there is no incompatibility in principle between the state's providing greater security in this way and the preservation of individual freedom.\" (p148)</p> </blockquote> <p>Hayek did not subscribe, in his own words, to a \"dogmatic laissez faire attitude\" (p85). He believed in rules \"to limit working hours or to require certain sanitary arrangements\", and believed they were \"fully compatible with the preservation of competition\" (p86). He added on the next page: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Nor is the preservation of competition incompatible with an extensive system of social services \u2013 so long as the organization of these services is not designed in such a way as to make competition ineffective over wide fields.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I could go on, but I sense you've gotten my point by now. It's important to read a thinker like Friedrich Hayek closely and honestly \u2013 never to idolize, nor to simplify and certainly never to highjack. Equally important, I believe, is to keep a critical perspective, to identify their hidden assumptions, to challenge them when they take a leap of faith. There would be a lot more to say about that and much to contest in Hayek \u2013 but it would have to start, at a minimum, from an honest and close reading.</p> <p>For now, I propose that we close with another interesting passage: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Wherever communal action can mitigate disasters against which the individual can neither attempt to guard himself nor make provision for the consequences, such communal action should undoubtedly be taken.\" (p148)</p> </blockquote> <p>I hope that staffers from both presidential campaigns will ponder those words. It would actually militate in favor of more universal healthcare than the Affordable Health Care Act now provides.</p>",

  "<p>Barack Obama's campaign team has published an <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/truth-team/entry/2016-obamas-america-is-a-deliberate-distortion-of-president-obamas-record-a\" title=\"\">extensive critique of a documentary</a> which accuses the US president of being an anti-colonialist who will work to reduce his country's influence on world affairs if he is re-elected this winter.</p> <p>2016: Obama's America, directed by Indian-American conservative author and commentator Dinesh D'Souza, has been a surprise box office success in the US this summer. As of last weekend, it had taken $26.2m (\u00a316.3m), behind only Michael Moore's anti-George W Bush polemic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2004/jul/09/1\" title=\"\">Fahrenheit 9/11</a> in the pantheon of US political documentaries.</p> <p>D'Souza's film argues the president's political instincts are anti-American \u2013 allegedly due to the influence of his supposedly anti-colonialist Kenyan father, Barack Obama Sr. It warns that a second term for the Democratic candidate after November's presidential election could change the country for good, and ends with the statement: \"The future is in your hands.\"</p> <p>Obama's re-election team hit back on Wednesday with an online post via the campaign website <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/\" title=\"\">BarackObama.com</a>. \"That his writings and film are based on lies should not come as a surprise to anyone given D'Souza's long history of attempting to add a veneer of intellectual respectability to fringe theories, conspiratorial fear-mongering, and flat-out falsehoods,\" it reads.</p> <p>\"Right-wing author Dinesh D'Souza has recently released 2016: Obama's America, a movie that falsely smears President Obama as having a hidden agenda bent on realising 'anti-colonial' ambitions',\" the post begins, before quoting a series of poor verdicts on the film and its director's previous work across a range of media.</p> <p>\"A self-proclaimed expert on the president, D'Souza bases the film around his own past works, which were previously described as 'the worst kind of smear journalism,' and riddled with 'lazy' errors,\" the post continues. \"The result is what Variety calls a 'cavalcade of conspiracy theories, psycho-politico conjectures and incendiary labelling' and what the LA Times labels a 'badly disguised and overly long attack ad'. A look at D'Souza's record is a look at a history of demonstrably false and ridiculous claims about the president, and 2016 is no exception. In fact, admitting President Obama was born in the US is what Bloomberg calls 'as close to moderation as this nutty film gets'.\"</p> <p>It adds: \"2016 promises to show viewers what they 'don't know' about President Obama, but instead reveals what Newsday called a 'ranter' peddling conspiracy theories. In place of an actual documentary, D'Souza employs 'pseudo-scholarly leaps of logic' to invent an imaginary character who has inherited 'anti-colonial,' 'Third World' views from his father \u2014 whom he last saw when he was 10 years old.\"</p> <p>Obama's team also suggests that D'Souza once falsely accused the president of backing the release of the Lockerbie bomber, despite his administration having stated its opposition to the move and written to the Scottish government to raise its strong objection. The team alleges that D'Souza once accused Obama of authorising the US bank bailouts when it was George W Bush who signed the troubled asset relief programme into law in October 2008.</p> <p>D'Souza, meanwhile, hit back in an <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/2016-obamas-america-documentary-barack-dinesh-dsouza-369598\" title=\"\">interview with the Hollywood Reporter</a>. \"Their original strategy was to lie low and hope this goes away, but now they're launching a full-scale attack,\" he said. \"And this is one of the most bizarre, clumsy and ineffective attacks I have seen in politics. Half of the stuff they talk about isn't even in the film \u2013 like the Lockerbie bomber. These guys are referencing a Columbia Journalism Review article that's two years old and is about my book, not about the film.\"</p> <p>D'Souza pointed out that Obama's team made no mention of the interview the commentator conducted with the president's Kenyan half-brother, George Obama, who lives in Huruma Flats near Nairobi, and who the film-maker claims lives in poverty.</p> <p>\"If Mitt Romney had a half brother living destitute in a third-world slum, it would be on the front page of the New York Times and a topic on MSNBC, CBS News and the Sunday talk shows,\" said D'Souza. \"But this fact is not even reported by those outlets. They just pretend it doesn't exist. It's immensely interesting that a guy who has more than 50 times quoted the Bible \u2013 'we are our brother's keeper' \u2013 has a half-brother he won't help at all. That's not a story?\"</p>",
  "<p>The taxman has clawed back an extra \u00a3500m from 5,000 of Britain's richest people after finding evidence of undeclared offshore income and tax evasion, it has emerged.</p> <p>The money, which averages out at \u00a3100,000 for each multi-millionaire targeted, has been collected by a special unit set up by HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) in 2009.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/menus/hnwu.htm\" title=\"\">High Net Worth Unit</a> (HNWU) has been looking into the personal tax affairs of about 5,000 of the UK's wealthiest taxpayers, each of whom has assets in excess of \u00a320m.</p> <p>HMRC said the unit had exceeded its collection targets. It had been expected to bring in about \u00a3100m a year, but in 2011-12 the tax yield hit \u00a3200m, which was on top of the \u00a3162m collected the previous year and the \u00a383m in 2009-10. Since April 2012 the unit has brought in \u00a380m.</p> <p>This money collected is on top of what the individuals normally pay.</p> <p>Some of the 5,000 will have been investigated and found to be in the clear, while others may have owed sizeable sums. The \u00a3500m includes \u00a387.5m of tax recovered from avoidance schemes HMRC had challenged.</p> <p>\"The very wealthy individuals dealt with by the HNWU usually have complex affairs, which means we need to pay particular attention to these customers and where possible work co-operatively with their agents to ensure the correct tax is paid,\" HMRC said.</p> <p>Often there are differences of legal opinion about how legislation applies in these circumstances \u2013 for example, where an individual has many different sources of income from UK and overseas activities.</p> <p>Martin Randall, head of the unit, which has 380 staff, said: \"The majority of the wealthiest taxpayers play by the rules, paying the right tax at the right time, but we take action against the minority who don't.\"</p> <p>Exchequer secretary David Gauke added: \"The government is committed to a fair tax system where those with the most contribute the most.

  "<p>Frankland prison in County Durham is notorious. The high-security, men-only jail has housed some of the most dangerous criminals in the country, including Charles Bronson, Harold Shipman and Ian Huntley. Three months ago, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/12/pair-killed-disembowelled-inmate\" title=\"\">two inmates there murdered and then disembowelled another</a>.</p> <p>It's not the sort of place where you might imagine a spot of cross stitch would go down well. But for more than six years Linda MacMullen, a grandmother and part-time French teacher, has been going to Frankland every fortnight to teach needlework to a group of 12 prisoners. She wears a personal alarm around her neck every time she goes in, and two prison officers stand outside the open door as she teaches.</p> <p>\"I know all the men who come to our class are in there for life sentences. I assume they are responsible for killing someone, but I don't know that. And I don't want to know. I just don't,\" she says. \"But I also think they are different people now to who they were. You can't be in a prison for 10, 15 years and still be that same person.\"</p> <p>MacMullen is one of 200 volunteers with <a href=\"http://www.finecellwork.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Fine Cell Work</a> (FCW), a social enterprise and charity which trains prisoners in paid intricate needlework, producing cushions, wall hangings and quilts. Most volunteers help out at the charity's offices \u2013 but 60 of them, like MacMullen, go into jails to work directly with prisoners.</p> <p>On Monday, the charity was presented with the <a href=\"http://www.finecellwork.co.uk/news_and_events/events/218_queens_award_for_voluntary_service\" title=\"\">Queen's award for voluntary service</a>, the highest possible honour that can be given to a volunteer group. FCW's founder, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/aug/20/lady-anne-tree-obituary\" title=\"\">Lady Anne Tree, who died in 2010</a>, spent decades lobbying the government to change the law to enable prisoners to earn money from their cells, before officially launching the charity in 1997. There are now more than 400 prisoners in 29 prisons across the UK making FCW products.</p> <p>It has been a busy time for FCW: the charity's first retail space opened last month (albeit a temporary one), <a href=\"http://www.finecellwork.co.uk/news_and_events/latest_news/203_fine_cell_work_pops_up_in_mayfair\" title=\"\">a pop-up store in Mayfair</a>. Products for sale include hand-embroidered cushions in retro geometric patterns, tote bags emblazoned with the word \"swag\" and pretty patchwork quilts. Big names in the craft world including <a href=\"http://www.emilypeacock.com/EmilyPeacockTapestry/Tapestry_Kits_designed_for_today.html\" title=\"\">Emily Peacock</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cathkidston.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Cath Kidston</a> and <a href=\"http://www.daisydevilleneuve.com/\" title=\"\">Daisy de Villeneuve</a> came up with designs specifically for the shop, which the prisoners then stitched up. The pieces aren't cheap (there are cushions for \u00a3150), but reflect the painstakingly long hours that go into each item \u2013 one cushion can take 100 hours to make, while a quilt takes a year.</p> <p>Next week the shop will be hosting craft events as part of the <a href=\"http://www.londondesignfestival.com/\">London Design Festival</a>, including an <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/353676964711854/\">all-day stitching session</a> where members of the public can drop in and sew a message to a prisoner. </p> <p>Almost all of the volunteers who teach needlework are women and the majority of the prisoners are men. It can make for a challenging dynamic, says Piero Donat, who works in FCW's head office. \"It is tough. We need to know the volunteers can work in a prison environment. Some prisoners haven't been taught by a woman before.\"</p> <p>Caroline Wilkinson is a retired teacher from south-east London. She started volunteering to teach patchwork and quilting at Wandsworth prison 12 years ago. Recently, the wing where she taught closed and the classes have since moved to Brixton jail.</p> <p>\"Wandsworth prison is pretty horrific. The physical surroundings are really intimidating. But inside the people are like you and me,\" she says. \"That's what I've come to appreciate.\"</p> <p>In the early days of her involvement with FCW, Wilkinson said she didn't want to go in a men's jail. But Katy Emck, the charity's CEO, persuaded her to give it a try. \"She said: 'It might not be as bad as you think.' And she was right.\"</p> <p>Wilkinson teaches three groups of 12 once a week. \"I did wonder how quilting would go down. It's not a very macho thing and I didn't think it would be attractive to them. But then 27 men turned up to my introduction, and I realised they just wanted to do something. The chance to earn money was a motivation, but not the only one. They are bored out of their minds and a lot of the prisoners just want to do something meaningful. And they can \u2013 just because they are in jail, it doesn't mean that they don't have practical or creative skills.\"</p> <p>Marjorie Coles is a former nurse who used to teach quilting to local women in her spare time; now she teaches a group of 10 male prisoners at Bullingdon prison in Bicester.</p> <p>\"Very occasionally there will be someone who I can tell is thinking, 'Oh, you're just a woman', but I ignore it,\" she says. \"My group is not aggressive or high-tension in any way, and works well together. They tell me they are much less wound up now when they are in their cells because they have something to do. I wouldn't say I know them very well, but I don't see them as prisoners. I see them as people.\"</p> <p>FCW prepares its volunteers for going into prison as much as it can. It advises them not to ask about crimes committed \u2013 \"The important thing is not the crime, but that the prisoner is trying to take a step towards changing his life,\" says Donat \u2013 and cautions against sharing personal details.</p> <p>But the volunteers say it's natural to form some sense of attachment and pride, especially when work is finished and handed in.</p> <p>\"The change you see in the men who come to the classes is amazing,\" says MacMullen. \"At first, they tend to be withdrawn. They won't make eye contact and won't talk, or lean away if you sit next to them. But slowly, with encouragement, they start to see what they are capable of. They start to talk, help each other. One man told me he was always being put in solitary [confinement] for fights, but that since he'd taken up stitching he didn't get put in there anymore. Instead of fighting, he's in his cell, stitching for hours and hours. That's the difference this makes.\"</p> <p>Hanging just inside the entrance to the pop-up store is a cream quilt with embroidered maroon birds in flight. It was made by one of Wilkinson's class members, and she called his sister to let her know it was there. \"She is absolutely devastated that he is in prison. It's the first time anything like that has happened to their family. But his sister is just so proud of the work he's doing, and knowing that has given him self-esteem too,\" Wilkinson says. \"It's just so extraordinary that craftwork can make such a difference.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 A volunteer will speaking about her experience of teaching embroidery to life-serving prisoners at the <a href=\"http://www.finecellwork.co.uk/\" title=\"\">FCW pop-up shop at 5 Grosvenor Street, London W1K 4DJ</a>, on 26 September.</em></p>",
  "<p>We've heard mixed responses to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/11/divorce-law-incomplete-uninformative\" title=\"\">Law Commission's consultation paper</a> from private client and high net worth family lawyers. \"If the Law Commission's critique of spousal maintenance is translated into law, that would be very welcome news to many working divorcees who see the effect of the current regime as a millstone which provides a meal ticket for life\", says Suzanne Todd of Withers.</p> <p>The current framework of divorce law is \"incomplete and uninformative\" and \"inaccessible and difficult to discover\", according to the Law Commission, because it doesn't provide judges with proper guidance for making consistent decisions about dividing marital property and because the rules about the treatment of assets brought into a marriage, or inherited during it, are unclear. This in turn makes it difficult for lawyers to advise clients and for those who can't afford legal advice to work out what they're entitled to when a marriage breaks down.</p> <p> \"We now have a hugely flexible and discretionary system which can cater for just about any domestic scenario,\" says Sandra Davis of Mishcon de Reya - the firm that acted for Princess Diana in her divorce. \"In most cases it is extremely difficult for a lawyer to predict on any given day what any given judge may think is a fair redistribution of matrimonial assets and income.\" She welcomes a review of the law but adds: \"There's no guarantee that a new description of the purpose of the legislation or a formula setting out how the assets and income should be divided would be any more certain or fairer.\"</p> <p>Richard Collins, a divorce expert at Charles Russell, is wary of proposals for reform, particularly the use of formulas: \"The unique feature of English and Welsh divorce law currently is that the court is able to apply fairness and reasonableness when it produces a bespoke, individual solution for each divorcing couple,\" he says. \"Whilst it has to be better for divorcing couples to have clarity and accessibility to the law, it is doubtful whether a one size fits all approach is fairer than the current situation where a judge exercises a wide discretion to provide a tailor made solution\".</p> <p>Ian Kennerley of Newcastle firm Silk Family Law thinks it is unfair of the Law Commission to compare a judge in a family court to bus driver, who hasn't been told where to go or why to go there. \"There is guidance there, but there is a need for further guidance, in particular on the issue of sharing future income and achieving a clean break in a longer marriage,\" he says.</p> <p>There has been a lot of talk about prenuptial agreements gaining popularity following the UK supreme court's decision in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/interactive/2010/oct/20/radmacher-judgment-prenups-supreme-court\" title=\"\">Radmacher v Granatino</a> and these have also been reviewed by the Law Commission. Post Radmacher the enforceability of a prenup remains difficult to predict as a court may hold that it isn't fair, nevertheless lawyers say they are on the increase. Kennerley is in favour of giving them statutory support. \"They will reduce the level of litigation and provide certainty,\" he says, \"But there needs to be the fallback consideration of fairness and they need to be reviewed and varied so that they continue to be fair after the birth of every child and after any significant change. What might be fair for a young couple at 25, may not be fair 25 years later.\"</p> <p>Mishcon de Reya's Miles Geffin says: \"We don't have a property or community regime in this jurisdiction. We have a system where a divorce court has an extremely wide discretion to distribute assets at the point of divorce.\" Prenups, which fix the amount the economically disadvantaged party gets on a breakup mitigate the risk. \"From the point of view of multimillionaires, the sharing principle is insane,\" he says. \"Anything they accumulated prior to the marriage is vulnerable for sharing.\"</p> <p>\"There are many more prenups since Radmacher and lawyers in England are beginning to realise and explore the possibilities of those agreements to address the parties expectations not just about a financial split on a breakdown but also how they commit to one another that their marriage is to be led,\" says John Burrell of Davenport Lyons. \"There is an appetite for some couples to make the agreed financial provision on a breakdown to be dependent on continued fidelity. The enforceability of such provision in a prenup remains untested. It would be wholly ignored on a divorce without a prenup.\"</p> <p>Burrell says that while each of the parties to a divorce is entitled to ask for his or her needs to be met there is no detailed guidance as to what that means. \"If the Law Commission produces a change which does state clearly what is to be regarded as 'needs' then that change in itself will give much greater clarity for the parties both in negotiating a prenup and, on an otherwise unregulated divorce, to know what they can expect.\"</p> <p>Kennerly tells me that as well as proving popular with people contemplating second marriages, he sees parents of young couples pushing for prenups in order to preserve inheritances and business assets.</p> <p>I can't decide whether it's odd, or just realistic to reduce the prospect of marriage to a commercial transaction with an end date. How do a couple in love, plus lawyers, hammer out a deal? Geffin tells me that, while US and Russian clients will usually have worked out what they want to happen when they come to see him, his UK clients tend not to have negotiated prenup terms when they arrive in his office. \"We Brits have a peculiar relationship with money,\" he says. \"We don't like talking about it.\"</p> <p>Doesn't the negotiation of the prenup cause problems in the relationship? \"Frequently it does\", says Geffin. \"If I'm acting for a wealthy husband-to-be who hasn't discussed with his fiancee what he wants to do and it just about passes the fairness test and the first contact she or her lawyers get is a very low proposed settlement, it is bound to cause difficulties, particularly if her expectation is somewhere closer to 50%.\" Geffin advises clients to agree the principles over the kitchen table or dinner before going to lawyers. \"The popular perception is that [prenups] are terribly unromantic, but isn't it better to agree in the best of times what you want to do in the worst of times?\" he asks.</p>",
  "<p>The questions are increasingly numerous. The answer remains as elusive as their subject.</p> <p>China's foreign ministry has spent a third straight day batting away queries on the whereabouts and health of the country's vice-president and heir apparent Xi Jinping.</p> <p>The 59-year-old, who is expected to take charge of the Communist party as early as next month, has <a href=\"please package with http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/11/xi-jinping-china-not-seen\" title=\"\">made no recorded appearances since 1 September</a> and, more unusually, has cancelled expected meetings with foreign leaders.</p> <p>Asked repeatedly and in various ways about Xi's health and schedule, spokesman Hong Lei told reporters at a daily press briefing: \"I have no information.\"</p> <p>Rumours have flown \u2013 the most common suggestion is that he has suffered some kind of injury or illness, possibly hurting his back. Others wonder if he is engaged in delicate political business in the runup to the party congress, which will unveil the new leadership line-up.</p> <p>Linda Jakobson, East Asia programme director at the Sydney-based Lowy Institute, described the affair as \"a debacle, not a crisis\" for the party. \"My hunch is that if this was a serious crisis we would see indications of it,\" she said.</p> <p>There is no sign of increased security in the Chinese capital and top leaders have continued to travel. Some have surmised that Xi must have a conspicuous injury or illness, so that releasing photographs or video of him would raise further questions.</p> <p>Jakobson said that was possible. \"But equally plausible would be that the people in charge of this issue are so set in their ways, and feel the state of the Chinese leaders is no one else's business, that they feel there is no need to produce a photograph \u2013 even if it would put to rest all these questions,\" she added. \"From my experience, the senior officials in charge of propaganda and communications tend to be the most old-fashioned, conservative and hardline people within the bureaucracy.\"</p> <p>Joseph Cheng, professor of political science at City University of Hong Kong, told Reuters that conservative elements feared releasing this kind of information might affect the leadership succession process or the party congress. \"They lack a sense of accountability to the domestic population and the international community,\" he said. \"Of course, they are concerned that talking about these issues may anger top leaders who don't want their health being discussed.\"</p> <p>There is precedent for such speculation: in 1993, the country's premier was not seen for seven weeks. It is thought that Li Peng suffered a heart attack, although his absence was officially ascribed to a cold. But China is now the world's second largest economy and an increasingly powerful player in international affairs. It is also less able to control the information available to its citizens. While many in China are happily oblivious to the rumours, microblog users have eagerly discussed them despite the best efforts of censors, finding oblique ways to refer to the vice-president. One user argued that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/11/senkaku-islands-china-patrol-ships\" title=\"\">extensive coverage of the dispute with Japan over islands in the East China Sea</a> was intended to cover up Xi's disappearance.</p> <p>Another noted: \"At present, the crown prince's accident is the most important thing. The remote island is nothing. Do you guys really know that or pretend not to know that?\" A third used English to evade controls, writing: \"Some said he has an ailment: a slight heart attack. It's blurry and opaque for our [politics] in China.\"</p> <p>Experts said it was likely that some within the party would be pushing for an explanation of Xi's absence from the public eye. Last year, state news agency Xinhua issued a terse statement <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/07/china-denies-reports-jiang-zemin-death\" title=\"\">denying that former president Jiang Zemin was dead</a> after a Hong Kong broadcaster wrongly reported his demise.</p>",
  "<p>Never let it be said that cannabis smokers can barely find enough energy to make their once-daily trip to the garage for crisps and chocolate milk: thanks to the weedheads of Australia, we now know that their habit is synonymous with artistry and digital activism on a truly industrial scale.</p> <p>On Instagram, you will find thousands of pictures documenting cannabis use in all its fascinating glory. Such subtle hashtags as \"cannabis\", \"marijuana\" and \"weed\" flag up photos of buds, bongs, towering home-grown plants, joints the size of baseball bats (obligatory, obviously), and scores of dead-eyed weed enthusiasts in the act of partaking.</p> <p>As a result, two things have happened. First, a whole knuckle-headed subculture has grown around the snaps, perfectly crystallised by a scintillating <a href=\"http://www.hailmaryjane.com/the-20-hottest-girlswhosmokeweed-on-instagr-am-ive-found-so-far/\" title=\"\">blog entry</a> from back in March titled The 20 Hottest #Girlswhosmokeweed on Instagram I've found (so far) and tweeted over 7,000 times. Second, there have been <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourcommunity/2012/09/instagram-hashtags-help-aussie-police-crack-down-on-marijuana.html\" title=\"\">threats from the authorities in Victoria</a> to somehow pursue anyone who has posted such images \u2013 which, predictably enough, have only accelerated the craze further.</p> <p>At which point, it is worth pausing for thought, and marvelling at the stupidity of it all. Of course, the state getting in such a lather about cannabis use only underlines the lunacy of its prohibition \u2013 as with this week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/11/cannabis-trade-rise-gun-violence\" title=\"\">Guardian story</a> about weed-trade-related violence and shootings, complete with a senior cop in Merseyside advocating harsher sentencing for those who grow and sell it. Both stories flag up much the same organised idiocy: the <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/true-crime-scene/potheads-use-photo-sharing-site-instagram-to-document-their-marijuana-crops/story-fnat7jnn-1226468152883\" title=\"\">Melbourne-based Herald Sun </a> quotes police warning that \"anyone who posts images of this nature may find themselves subject to a criminal investigation\"; assistant chief constable Andy Ward thunders that \"the amount of money being made by criminals should be reflected in the sentencing\". Shades, as always, of <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/chi-081112-repeal-photogallery,0,6414799.photogallery\" title=\"\">Chicago circa 1925</a>, a colossal waste of human effort \u2013 and, all too often, utterly needless gangsterism.</p> <p>That much surely ought to be accepted by anyone even halfway rational. But at the same time, the Australian Instagram hoo-hah also points up marijuana's real dangers \u2013 which, for most of its users, are less a matter of psychosis and mental breakdown, than induction into a culture of narcissistic tedium. Once you're in, it is very hard to escape: if you're not careful, as well as your daily motivation crashing to the point that even the aforementioned crisps and chocolate milk become a stretch, you will find yourself boxed in by a great wall of novelty cigarette papers, \"amusing\" stash tins and equally entertaining water-pipes. Worse, weed may well end up being all you talk about, in much the same way that real ale enthusiasts go on endlessly about \"hoppy brews\" and \"session ales\", talking to no one but themselves.</p> <p>In that sense, the Instagram galleries amount to a great big cautionary tale. Look at her, with her <a href=\"http://statigr.am/p/278667328773778405_221631113\" title=\"\">leaf-shaped tattoo</a>! Look at him, with his presumably <a href=\"http://statigr.am/p/256114432315408795_205610175\" title=\"\">brain-shredding bong</a>!

And then think about the spectacle of a drug culture that does not put its chosen substance at the centre of a whole creative firmament (a la ecstasy, acid, and at a push, booze), but that worships intoxication for its own sake. Boring!</p> <p>Therein, I think, lies one of the best arguments for decriminalisation \u2013 not just of the use of cannabis, but the whole industry that feeds it. Just imagine: we might thereby separate dope-smoking from the kudos that comes with illegality, convince a few Instagram-posting types that smoking weed is not interesting or sexy in any way, and thereby stop people making such a huge fuss about a substance that is, in any case, often a byword for humanity at its most myopic and useless (hash in particular has always struck me as leaden means of glueing yourself to the furniture, thinking crap music great, and finding amusement in the most banal rubbish). We can but hope: on this evidence, though, the revolution is not about to start in Australia.</p>",

Please can you look into documentation which explains the reasons for this reduced manpower?</p> <p>G7 \u2014 Ref: PC 2302 Powell, Taylor Report referring to the policing in Leppings Lane at 2.45pm. The following passage was omitted: The first thing I said was \"where are all the Bobbies, there is hardly anyone there\", I could not understand how such a crowd could possibly gathered. I recall in previous games there was usually a large police presence concentrated on this part of the ground, usually forming some sort of cordon.

Why was the order given to open gates and not consider the consequences to the people inside? It wasn't just one person in the control box, everybody there had a duty of care to those attending the match.</p> <p>G22 \u2014 Taylor states: \"Duckenfield made a blunder of the first magnitude by opening the gates and not sealing off the already full pens.\" Other officers in the control box could have told Duckenfield that he needed to close the tunnel leading to pens 3 and 4 before opening the gates. Was this the case?</p> <p>G23 \u2014 This scenario also applies to the implementation of the major accident and emergency plan: nobody in the control box set the plan in motion, although all had been trained in major accident procedures. Will the panel please investigate this in greater detail than Taylor did especially with their greater access to relevant documentation?</p> <p>G24 \u2014 At the mini inquest Dr Ernest Gumpet said it wouldn't be possible to establish life extinct unless a person has had an ECG, so why did only 14 of the victims get to hospital? The rest were declared dead in the temporary mortuary by two doctors with one stethoscope between them.</p> <p>G25 \u2014 How many people were placed by the river Don, being assumed dead, and for how long were they left \u2013 note we have no evidence backing this point.</p> <p>G26 \u2014 The treatment the families received at the temporary mortuary on the night of 15 April 1989 requires further scrutiny: statements were taken immediately after the families had identified their loved ones, without any legal representation. These statements were then used in inquests etc. The inference was all around alcohol.</p> <p>G27 \u2014 Coroner Dr Popper's instructions were to take blood alcohol levels on all victims \u2013 why were no blood alcohol levels taken from the senior police officers and other key officials as would be the case in, for example, a road crash. Points to the fact that even by 5pm the decision was taken to blame other people and they assumed alcohol played a relevant part.</p> <p>G28 \u2014 According to Senior Nurse Manager Mr Eccleston (who attended the temporary mortuary at 3.55pm) \"the scene was of absolute chaos\". With statements like this how could two doctors still manage to certify people dead?</p> <p>G29 \u2014 Why did Peter Wright make such a speedy exit?</p> <p>G30 \u2014 Why did South Yorkshire police request West Midlands police force to conduct enquiries and collect statements from witnesses?</p> <p>G31 \u2014 Why were the radial fence gates of Pens 2 and 3 locked when Sheffield Wednesday were told those pens were only safe if the gates were left open? (The fire service stated it was safe only if those gates remained open!)</p> <p>G32 \u2014 Why was the football club or its officials never charged with neglect and/or failing in their duty of care?</p> <p>G33 \u2014 Will the panel be looking into events as a whole or will they also address individual cases and aspects?</p> <p>G34 \u2014 How can the panel be sure they have reviewed all the documents? How would they even know if they have been given all the documents?

Raves and other music events are also being proposed, that will focus attention on the cull and make it more difficult to carry out.</p> <p>A group of mainstream campaigners including the RSPCA, the League Against Cruel Sports, the Badger Trust and the Humane Society will continue to push the government to change its mind over the cull, which is designed to combat the spread of bovine tuberculosis (TB). They are still hoping that \"people power\" could force the coalition to reverse its decision to allow badgers to be shot.</p> <p>But it is also clear that if all legal avenues and political avenues are shut off, some people are determined to take direct action to sabotage the cull.</p> <p>Among those at a national rally against the cull held in Bristol on Tuesday were animal rights activists from Manchester who said they would be back in the west of England at the end of this month and the start of next when the cull is expected to start.</p> <p>One of them, who asked to be identified as Nuala Bug-Eye, said they would work within the law. \"We know who the cullers are,\" she said. \"We'll be in those areas making sure they can't come out and quietly go about their shooting. If you're in the area making noise, badgers are not going to come out and be shot. We feel the science has been ignored and badgers are being scapegoated.</p> <p>\"We can understand that it's awful for the farmers, it's awful for the cattle. Once they've done the badgers will they go after the deer? It's not going to end with the badgers.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LCN_MbtGaDE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LCN_MbtGaDE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The rally was a colourful one with some turning up in animal costumes, wearing badger masks or black and white face paint. Woody Fox (his real name, changed by deed poll) said he also feared the badger cull could open the door for other wildlife to be culled.</p> <p>\"We have hardly any wildlife left. There seems to be excuse after excuse to kill them all. I can understand the plight of farmers but it has never been proven that culls can work. It's another attack on wildlife. It goes on and on. Every creature we have is persecuted.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/s9r9qzEv3YU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/s9r9qzEv3YU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Brian May, the guitarist from the rock band Queen and a vocal animal rights campaigner, spoke at the rally and said the fight would continue. \"I think we are all hoping that David Cameron is looking at the possibility of reorganising and delaying the cull while they look more carefully at vaccination. You could kill all the badgers in Britain and it would not stop the problem of bovine TB in cows.\"</p> <p>At the appeal court in London the Badger Trust's legal team had argued the cull would break the 1992 law protecting badgers, which allows culling to \"prevent the spread of disease\". They claimed the law is intended only to license culls for one or two landowners, not a mass cull. But three court of appeal judges <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/11/badger-cull-legal-challenge-fails\" title=\"\">decided the government's proposals did not break the law</a>.</p> <p>The trust will now decide whether to attempt to take their legal action to the supreme court.</p> <p>Gwendolen Morgan, a solicitor at Bindmans acting for the trust, said: \"It makes no sense economically, scientifically, ethically or logically, or in terms of public safety.\"</p> <p>Morgan, who worked on the trust's successful legal challenge against a badger cull in Wales, added that the proposed cull would actually spread bovine TB, based on the findings of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jul/11/badger-culling-ineffective-krebs\" title=\"\">a landmark decade-long trial which showed that fleeing badgers carried TB to new areas</a>. The trial found that, at best, TB incidence was reduced in the cull area by just 16% after nine years.</p> <p>The government argues the cull is necessary to curb the rising number of tuberculosis infections in cattle, which led farmers to slaughter 26,000 animals in 2011 alone. Owen Paterson, the new environment secretary, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/sep/04/environment-owen-paterson-spelman-reshuffle\" title=\"\">is a strong supporter of culling</a>.</p> <p>A badger vaccination programme is replacing the cull plan in Wales, that was abandoned following legal challenges and the election of a new political administration. Vaccination is being tested by the National Trust in Devon and by the Wildlife Trust in Gloucestershire. The previous Labour government said an oral badger vaccine would be ready by 2015. The coalition cancelled five of the six trials of injectable vaccines and said a viable oral vaccine is \"years away\".</p> <p>One other avenue still open is a complaint at the Council of Europe from the Humane Society International (HSI), <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/30/uk-badger-cull-breach-eu-law\" title=\"\">which argues the badger cull contravenes the Bern Convention that protects wildlife</a>.</p> <p>Mark Jones, the executive director of HSI UK said: \"As signatories to Bern, the UK is obliged to keep the badger population out of danger, a duty that is unquestionably abused by the plan to shoot and kill the vast majority of these magical animals in local areas.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2Zca2-ahY80?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2Zca2-ahY80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\"The badger is an iconic wild mammal, one of the few we've got left in the UK.

  "<p>Governance in the public sector is a mystery. The revelation at the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/former-care-chief-sorry-for-attack-on-whistleblower-8126148.html\" title=\"\">Commons health select committee hearing</a> on Tuesday of name-calling around the Care Quality Commission board table adds to that mystery.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/07/head-care-quality-commission-resigns\" title=\"\">Dame Jo Williams' exit from the care regulator</a> is not going to stop NHS trusts worrying about inspections, at least as long as the public views them as credible. Nor will her going ease new chief executive David Behan's difficulties in reconciling the volume of registration and inspection he can afford with burgeoning demand, especially when it's shouted for by the very ministers and MPs intent on cutting his budget.</p> <p>But nursery school behaviour on a corporate board matters. If the chair of the regulator of mental health provision in the NHS plays fast and loose with the alleged mental health of one of her board members, what does that imply about the regulator's capacity and fairness?</p> <p>What can the CQC now say about the governance of NHS trusts with a straight face? We don't know enough about what inspectors actually do, either when they are present or when they hover as a potential threat. In my experience CQC visits are resented, rather than regarded as opportunities to learn. Relations between NHS and social care staff with individual CQC staff may be good, but there is a grinding resentment felt at the institution. That sense of the CQC as an imposition and cost can only have grown as a result of its corporate shenanigans.</p> <p>In re-building the regulator, Behan will draw on personal experience. It's not that long since Guardian Public magazine featured Behan, then chief executive of the Commission for Social Care Inspection, and Dame Denise Platt, then chair of CSCI, as a formidable duo, who seemed to have resolved the tensions inherent in the twin roles. CSCI was of course subsequently absorbed into the CQC.</p> <p>Behan has to cope, as do leaders of all state regulators, with the debilitating background presence of civil servants and ministers, who often treat the formula 'arm's length' with disdain \u2013 as perhaps Behan did in his <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/06/david-behan-cqc/\" title=\"\">former role at the Department of Health</a>. Richmond House will be poking into the CQC and Behan, with Williams' successor, will enter a relationship of administrative troilism. It's an open question whether Whitehall departments want chairs to exercise independent judgement, whatever it says on the tin.</p> <p>Last week, Communities and Local Government officials must have rubbed their hands as they listened to the <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmcomloc/553/55302.htm\" title=\"\">pre-appointment hearing </a>for the new chair of the Audit Commission, Jeremy Newman.</p> <p>Newman, who is from the accountancy firm BDO, did his utmost to persuade listeners that the perception of accountants as the greyest of the grey is correct. In winding up the commission \u2013 provided the legislation goes through \u2013 Newman is not going to give communities secretary Eric Pickles or his civil servants any trouble.</p> <p>That may not be the case, however, for another recent high profile regulatory appointment, that of writer and broadcaster William Shawcross as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2012/sep/07/new-charity-commission-chair-appointed\" title=\"\">chair of the Charity Commission</a>. Shawcross is, of course, politically sound, as a supporter of Margaret Thatcher and sweetly sympathetic biographer of Rupert Murdoch. But loud-mouthed journalists do not always know when to shut up, and Shawcross could well commit some verbal blunder, offending the voluntary sector and giving Francis Maude and his colleagues second thoughts about having one of their own in position.</p> <p>But will Shawcross do the legwork, read the papers, master the detail of charity regulation to the point that he will make any difference to what chief executive Sam Younger and his staff, struggling with shrunken budgets, would do anyway?</p> <p>That brings us back to the question of what difference any given boardroom or governance setup makes, especially in these regulatory bodies that are so closely monitored by their 'parent' Whitehall departments. If, pending sorely needed research and evaluation, their impact comes close to 'not a great deal', then we can safely watch the antics of Williams and Co as mere entertainment, lacking administrative significance.</p> <p><em>David Walker is contributing editor to the Public Leaders Network.</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The list of things that people are expecting \u2013 or perhaps hoping \u2013 to see in an iPhone 5 is growing longer and longer: 4G/LTE connectivity, fingerprint recognition, a bigger screen. But what are the things that would really be useful in the next iPhone? </p> <p>Having used an iPhone for around a year, and before that having used Android phones, and having also used Windows Phones at various points in between, here's my list of things that I really want to see in the next iPhone \u2013 though I'm not necessarily optimistic that they'll arrive. There's also a list of things that are rumoured (some more than others) but I don't expect.</p> <h2>What the next iPhone should have</h2> <p><strong>1) Better signal reception.</strong> I live in a rural area where the mobile signal is variable at best; though it's possible to get a signal in the kitchen standing at the end of the table, moving a few inches to left or right can kill it to zero. When I've tried Samsung smartphones and non-smartphones on the same network in the same location, they seem to handle it fine. </p> <p><strong>2) Longer battery life.</strong> Of course, everyone says they want this, but the iPhone is again not a great contender. The iPhone 4S in particular has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/11/iphone-4s-battery-life-standby\">shorter standby battery life than the iPhone 4</a>, for reasons that have never been explained (though might be due to the heftier CPU). Certainly I've found that after a day consisting of a couple of hours' music listening, in parallel with a few hours' email, web and app use plus some phone calls, that the iPhone falls gasping across the threshold as you arrive home. </p> <p>Other makers (Samsung again, and RIM's BlackBerrys, and to a lesser extent Nokia's new Lumias) do better here. Perhaps the addition of an LTE capability with a larger screen (both anticipated) will mean a bigger battery capacity \u2013 so that if you're not using 4G, you'll get more battery time. I certainly hope so.</p> <p><strong>3) Android's \"pattern unlock\" system.</strong> Since I first used it on the first Android phone (the G1), I've liked this system enormously. You have a 3x3 grid of dots: you swipe a pattern (which you decide) to unlock it. Much quicker and easier to get right than numeric pins you type in. Obviously, to offer this Apple would have to license the patent from Google \u2013 and that's unlikely to happen in a hurry.</p> <p><strong>4) A \"scripting language\"</strong> to tie together multiple functions. Sometimes you want to turn off your Wi-Fi or turn off your 3G at the same time that you start a new app, or set an alarm for 15 minutes' time unless you receive a phone call, or any number of combined actions. That's when you need to be able to chain together functions from different settings or apps. Desktop OSs have this (Apple has a language called \"Applescript\"), and Android has an app that uses it in the form of <a href=\"http://tasker.dinglisch.net/\">Tasker</a>. As smartphones get smarter, we need to make them simpler to use by putting programs together. </p> <p>There are some signs that Apple is doing something like this, with a <a href=\"http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/12/08/28/apple_patent_hints_at_situationally_aware_iphone.html\">patent on a system to change smartphone settings by location</a>, but that falls a little short. Also, the strings of actions you want to trigger aren't necessarily location-dependent; it might depend on time, or battery level, or location.</p> <p><strong>5) More control of phone functions using Siri.</strong> Though everyone was dismissive about Siri when it was introduced, I have found it increasingly effective: having a phone with a multi-digit numeric lock means that it's often faster to tell Siri \"Tell X I'm on my way over\" and have that sent as a text message than to unlock the phone, go to the Messages app, type a name and type a message. I can also walk while Siri does the hard work, which means I get there sooner. </p> <p>Voice control is surprisingly liberating once you start using it enough. Get a pair of headphones with a mic and you don't have to take the phone out of your pocket.</p> <p>But what's missing is the ability to use Siri to turn functions such as Wi-Fi on or off, <strike> or to launch apps </strike> (<a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/siri/\">you can launch apps in iOS6</a>), or trigger a chain of actions created by your scripting language as above. (Obviously you'd want to block: \"Siri, factory reset.\") There's a whole landscape of voice-controlled potential out there just waiting to be used. </p> <p><strong>6) A bigger screen.</strong> It's not that high on my list, but it's definitely a good thing in a phone. In time I can see phones becoming more like Samsung's Galaxy Note with its 5in screen: you control it mostly without having to see it (by voice), and then bring it out when you do want to interact with the screen, which because it's big offers the best interaction. Samsung is definitely on the right track with the Note.</p> <p><strong>7) Better use of colour</strong> to indicate status in the status bar at the top of the screen. At the moment they're monochrome; but it would be useful to know whether the phone signal is strong or weak through coloured bars (red, orange, green) as well as the number of bars; ditto for Wi-Fi and battery. It means at-a-glance understanding of what the phone's state is.</p> <p><strong>8) Less intrusive notifications.</strong> The introduction of notifications in the status bar in iOS5 (which people say copy Android, but are actually much more like Palm's webOS \u2013 because the engineer came from Palm) is great: it's a very quick way to find out what's new. But they have an annoying habit of covering navigation elements at the top of any onscreen page.</p> <p>That means that if you're in a hurry and haven't been using your phone and have a lot of notifications, they keep rolling over the element and getting in your way; you have to flick them out of the way like flies, and there's a high risk of hitting a notification instead of an element, and getting yanked over to the notifying app. This is really annoying. Perhaps a larger screen will solve this by putting more space between status bar and the onscreen elements. Here's hoping.</p> <p><strong>9) 4G/LTE.</strong> We know this is coming, but it would be good to have the option of the superfast speeds it offers, even at the cost of burning through one's battery in an hour or so.</p> <p><strong>10) Wireless charging.</strong> Nokia got here first with the Lumia 920 (and HP before that with the TouchPad tablet). It is indubitably cool to be able to dump a phone in a cradle without attachments and then grab it up when you need it. </p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href=\"http://twitter.com/HmmmUK/status/245539620337627136\">one remark on Twitter</a> was \"it appears a 'Samsung Android' already answers a number of your iPhone X requirements\". That's true except in one key area: user experience. In my opinion, the iOS experience is better than Android in lots of subtle ways that cumulatively all add up.

  "<p>The most memorable concoction that fizzed out of the brain of Douglas Adams was the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/guide/babelfish.shtml\" title=\"\">Babelfish</a>, the universal translator. Even so, there were times during the first Global Chemical Industry Sustainability summit in Brussels where I could have used a gallon jar of Adams' other great concoction, the <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bartending/Cocktails/Pan_Galactic_Gargle_Blaster\" title=\"\">Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster</a>, a cocktail to end all cocktails.</p> <p>Listening to some speakers was like being an architect of the Tower of Babel, watching aghast as the best-laid plans broke down into a welter of competing tongues. Perhaps I exaggerate slightly, but we really do have a language problem in this space, and it seems to be getting worse.</p> <p>One speaker showed a slide headed 'Sustainability is \u2026', spotlighting Shin-Etsu, a Japanese chemical company that suffered a major explosion. Instead of clamming up, as Japanese corporate leaders are wont to do, the CEO took a voluntary pay-cut and went out to apologise to the local community.</p> <p>Apologising to people when you have accidentally blown them up makes sense, most of the time, but in the context of the global challenges we face I struggle to see this as a definitive (indeed, even a legitimate) case of sustainability in practice.</p> <p>Then another speaker, this time from ExxonMobil Chemical, asserted that \u2013 based on the latest life-cycle assessment data \u2013 shopping bags made out of high density polyethylene (HDPE) are the sustainable option. Paper bags, he insisted, should be dropped because of the energy and water consumption involved. Ah. When the discussion period came, I asked whether the data had taken into account the great swirling gyres of plastic debris that now scar large areas of the world ocean? No, he admitted.</p> <p>For such people, as a speaker from BASF assured us, sustainability means we \"are on a journey\". Like many others, this German company has talked to a considerable number of stakeholders (350, by their reckoning) and boiled it all down to a shortlist of issues (just 40 of those). The main conclusion seems to be that we must all create more shared value while, simultaneously, shrinking our environmental footprints.</p> <p>Good, but by how much? That's a question that the sector finds it hard to answer, except in areas where there is a legal requirement that the use of particular chemicals be driven to zero, like hexavalent chromium. And, while most participants intensely dislike the idea of further regulation, there were those \u2013 including Peter Kunze of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association \u2013 who argued for much clearer signals on which chemicals would be banned ultimately, coupled with \"smart legislation\" to ensure that the process of conversion didn't undermine industrial or regional competitiveness.</p> <p>It was intriguing to see successive speakers through the lenses of vested interests. A panel of four speakers, for example, agreed that renewable feedstocks were very unlikely to make much of an impression on the industry in the next decade or two. Then a colleague from another chemical company whispered in my ear that three of the four companies were backwards-integrated into the oil sector, effectively making them fossil fuel junkies. Hardly surprising, then, that they find it hard to imagine \u2013 or at least publicly admit the possibility of \u2013 a radically different future.</p> <p>Behind the scenes people spoke quietly of lobbying that is underway by parts of the industry: in the US, for example, chemical companies are fighting tooth-and-nail to ensure suspect chemicals and products like formaldehyde and styrene continue to be allowed in LEED-certified buildings.</p> <p>On the upside, Nicholas Denis of McKinsey &amp; Co reported results of their recent market survey showing that green products are now seen much more positively by both consumers and industry executives, with between 82 and 93% of both categories saying they want to go greener, even though \"the road to green chemicals is harder than we thought initially\" and the notion of a \"green premium is still a Holy Grail for most companies.\"</p> <p>Procter &amp; Gamble promptly disagreed, to a degree, noting that their efforts to promote greener products like compact detergents had been stymied by the unwillingness of most consumers to change to seemingly smaller products at the same price-point. So the detergent industry went to government, asked for permission to avoid anti-trust rules, and moved as a group of companies to strip non-compact products from the shelves. \"I would love it if consumers wanted greener products, mused P&amp;G's Peter Kunze, \"because we would then have a business model!\"</p> <p>One of the most interesting moments was when Barend van Bergen, who heads up KPMG's climate and sustainability centre, reported the results of a survey they had done of different sectors looking at how much of their profits are at risk because of environmental and wider sustainability issues. The answer for the chemical sector: 43%.</p> <p>In contrast to most summit meetings, many of the people in Brussels were in the middle to upper-middle layers of their companies. They might argue that \"sustainable development is in the genes of our company,\" as one speaker from Solvay did, but too often they were fighting their battles in the foothills, either unable to see the wider landscape, or without the authority to break ranks and embrace disruptive concepts like zero, waste or toxics.</p> <p>But I and John Pearson, the entrepreneurial American CEO of Chemical Industry Roundtables LLP, relish a challenge. We agreed that we would aim to keep the sector under pressure and propose an event in 2013, using zero-based thinking as a means of stretching the sustainability agenda.</p> <p>And things may just be going our way. The <a href=\"http://www.wbcsd.org/vision2050.aspx\" title=\"\">Vision 2050</a> mapping done by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) contained a number of zero targets, but the news that WBCSD is now going to test its projections against the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/business-solutions-based-scientific-analysis\" title=\"\">Stockholm Resilience Centre's nine planetary boundaries</a> suggests there could well be a lot more <a href=\"http://thezeronauts.com/\" title=\"\">zero, net-zero or towards zero</a> targets in a year or two.</p> <p><em>John Elkington is executive chairman of </em><a href=\"http://www.volans.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Volans</em></a><em> and non-executive director at </em><a href=\"http://www.sustainability.com/\" title=\"\"><em>SustainAbility</em></a><em>.

  "<p>A group of environmentalists in Glasgow has launched a campaign to improve some of the city's most dilapidated housing. Not with placards or postcards, but with peas, beetroot and thermal imaging cameras.</p> <p>Volunteers from the charity <a href=\"http://southseeds.org/\">South Seeds</a> are focusing on tenement blocks on the city's south side \u2013 home to some of Glasgow most dilapidated slum housing - in an effort to increase the buildings' energy efficiency and raise living conditions for residents.</p> <p>Maf Smith, a key figure in South Seed's managing committee and a renewable energy specialist, said the project also focused on working with tenants and residents, not housing officials, by training \"tenement champions\" to strengthen community bonds and foster a spirit of self-help. He said: </p> <blockquote> <p>Tenements are classed as 'hard to treat homes', and if improvements can be made in one area of the building, it's often only possible with the agreement of all the residents.</p> <p>That can be a real brake when people are trying to take action, so our Tenement Champions programme is trying to find people who can coordinate their neighbours and improve their buildings.</p> </blockquote> <p>Established in 2011, South Seeds has already worked to turn derelict sites in Glasgow into community gardens. The group is now expanding after receiving a \u00a3278,000 grant from the Scottish government's <a href=\"http://ccf.keepscotlandbeautiful.org/\">Climate Challenge Fund</a>, which provides money for community environmental projects.</p> <p>It will carry out thermal imaging of tenement blocks to identify the buildings most in need of insulation. It will offer advice on grants and incentives for repairs and property improvements, and produce online videos explaining how residents can increase the energy efficiency of their homes.</p> <p>Caroline Gausden, who lives with her daughter in a tenement flat in the south side district of Crosshill, said that South Seeds' efforts had had a noticeable effect on her and her neighbours' living conditions:</p> <blockquote> <p>We asked for their help to build a garden in our back court, which was very overgrown and had been used to dump rubbish.</p> <p>They worked with us to tidy it all up, cut the grass and put in vegetable beds. It used to be just an unused space, but this summer the neighbours have been out sunbathing and it's a safe place for my daughter to play.</p> <p>We've grown peas, beetroot, potatoes, courgettes \u2013 everyone's been really keen to get involved.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Gausden said before the project she had only really known neighbours on her own landing. Now she knows all the residents involved in the garden:</p> <blockquote> <p>We started talking about the state of the building. We had a really rubbish factor [property manager] who always said they were getting quotes for repairs, but the work was never done, so we got together and booted them out.</p> <p>Since then we've installed foam insulation in the loft and had treatment for damp, which has been a problem for the three years I've been here. We also helped an older lady with major repairs to her flat which she wasn't able to do on her own.</p> </blockquote> <p>Built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Glasgow's tenements became notorious for their overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, with large extended families crammed into one or two small rooms. Their back courts commonly featured communal outdoor toilets and rubbish heaps known as middens \u2013 dumps for food scraps, discarded household and human waste.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396049818\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/9/3/1346680906071/South-Seeds-Glasgow-Agnew-003.jpg\" alt=\"South Seeds, Glasgow, Agnew Lane\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Agnew Lane, Glasgow, before South Seeds began work. Photograph: South Seeds</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: South Seeds</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The buildings have since been renovated. In some areas of the city tenement flats are sought-after for their thick walls, high ceilings and period features. But other buildings are in a poor state of repair; parts of the city may be seeing accelerating improvements in the housing stock but in some, historic problems endure.</p> <p>Govanhill, on the city's south side, has had a particular problem with tenements in slum conditions. Many flats bought by private landlords in the buy-to-let boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s have fallen into disrepair and now serve as cheap, poor-quality housing for recent immigrants.</p> <p>A spokesman for <a href=\"http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/\">Glasgow City Council</a>, said it had invested \u00a310m over the past three years in such properties but it had been forced, because of the scale of the task, to prioritise the buildings in the greatest need of repair:</p> <blockquote> <p>We've had to do roof work and major structural repairs, deal with damp and rot and secure the foundations of tenements that were built over old mine-workings.</p> <p>Unfortunately a lot of these flats have been bought by people who didn't understand the need for ongoing investment in a property. We've had people with significant property portfolios who have been struck off the landlords' register.</p> <p>There can also be difficulties where residents are in agreement that work needs to be done, but one or two owners are unable or unwilling to contribute their share of the costs.</p> </blockquote> <p>Smith believes South Seeds' approach helps tenements residents take back some control of their lives and homes. They can give people on each stair confidence and support, even with just a very modest \u00a3278,000 to share around.</p> <blockquote> <p>The tenement champions can build up trust between neighbours. Once that's done, there's a lot that people can do for themselves.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>* This article has been amended to remove the name of the Glasgow city council spokesman.

Apparently, he had nothing to declare but his genius.</p> <h2>Celebrity</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396023046\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2012/9/11/1347377670080/Film-still-of-Wilde-004.jpg\" alt=\"Film still of 'Wilde'\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Film still of 'Wilde', starring Stephen Fry as Oscar Wilde Photograph: Liam Daniel</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liam Daniel/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You may not expect this film to begin in the American west, but it does. Wilde (Stephen Fry, who could not be more perfectly cast) is on a speaking tour of the US. A silver mine in Colorado is being named after him. Thoughtfully, the owners have filled it with hunky miners who are mostly naked. He addresses these \"enormous, powerfully-built men \u2026 their brawny arms folded over their muscular chests, a loaded gun on each thigh\" (his description) on the subject of 16th-century Italian goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini. They ask why Wilde hasn't brought Cellini along. Wilde explains sadly that he is dead. \"Who shot him?\" asks one. According to Wilde's letters, this is true.</p> <h2>Sexuality</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396023047\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Archive/Search/2012/9/12/1347444099598/Wilde-006.jpg\" alt=\"Wilde\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wilde Photograph: Moviestore Collection / Rex Feat</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore Collection / Rex Feat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At this stage (1882), Wilde appears to be heterosexual. This has been disputed by Wilde's recent biographer Neil McKenna, who has argued that Wilde had a sexual relationship with Frank Miles in 1876 \u2013 but McKenna's book was published in 2003, and this film was made in 1997. Wilde marries Constance Lloyd (Jennifer Ehle) and produces two children. The kiddies grow up at breakneck speed, on account of 1882 to 1888 being given only a couple of minutes of screentime: there is more detail than is strictly needed, but the film does stick to the facts. Wilde is seduced by a young friend, Robbie Ross (Michael Sheen, who it is now impossible not to see as Tony Blair \u2013 lending this scene a curious extra frisson). He ventures out at night to spend time with his boy, telling Constance: \"I shan't be back till late. I'm dining with the Asquiths.\" A splendid new euphemism.</p> <h2>Love</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396023048\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Archive/Search/2012/9/12/1347444029320/Wilde-006.jpg\" alt=\"Wilde\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wilde Photograph: Moviestore Collection / Rex Feat</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore Collection / Rex Feat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the premiere of Lady Windermere's Fan in February 1892, Wilde meets Lord Alfred Douglas, known as Bosie (Jude Law). In real life, the two met when another of Wilde's young men brought Bosie to his residence on Tite Street in 1891. Wilde offers to visit Bosie at Magdalen College, Oxford. \"They're threatening to send me down,\" Bosie brags. \"How could they be so cruel to one so beautiful?\" replies Wilde. A long pause later, Bosie replies pompously: \"Dons. They're so middle class.\" Oh dear, he's a git. Unfortunately, Wilde falls so hopelessly in love that he can't seem to see Bosie's gittishness. Instead, he blames every appalling tantrum from his golden boy on the boy's violent father, the Marquess of Queensberry.</p> <h2>Scandal</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396023049\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Archive/Search/2012/9/12/1347443500317/Wilde-006.jpg\" alt=\"Wilde\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wilde Photograph: Moviestore Collection / Rex Feat</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore Collection / Rex Feat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Defiant in the face of Queensberry's rage, Wilde and Bosie spend all their time enthusiastically dining with the Asquiths. Finally, Queensberry leaves a card for Wilde with an insult scrawled illegibly on it. Wilde read this as \"To Oscar Wilde, ponce and Somdomite\" (Queensberry meant \"sodomite\", but wasn't too good at spelling). Queensberry claimed it read \"posing as a Somdomite\". Later readers have interpreted it as \"posing Somdomite\". Wilde sues for libel. Bad idea: for something to be a libel, it must be untrue. Queensberry is acquitted. Wilde is arrested for sodomy and gross indecency, tried, and sentenced to two years' hard labour. The film does a sterling job of representing the trial, including the whole of <a href=\"http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/wilde/Crimwilde.html\" title=\"\">Wilde's eloquent real-life speech</a> in response to the question \"What is the 'love that dare not speak its name'?\"</p> <h2>Reputations</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396023050\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Archive/Search/2012/9/12/1347444177826/Wilde-006.jpg\" alt=\"Wilde\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wilde Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After his release, Wilde goes into exile. He visits his late wife's grave, which is inscribed \"Wife of Oscar Wilde\". In the context of Wilde's disgrace, this looks like a brave, loyal gesture on Constance's part; but it's not accurate. As the real Wilde wrote at the time, it was \"very tragic seeing her name carved on a tomb \u2013 her surname, my name not mentioned of course \u2013 just 'Constance Mary, daughter of Horace Lloyd QC' and a verse from Revelations.\" The words \"Wife of Oscar Wilde\" were added long after both their deaths, in 1963.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>A solid biopic, with fine performances \u2013 though in its sombre tone and attempt to cover too much of Wilde's life, it could be accused of overstating the vital importance of being earnest.</p>",

  "<p>The wailing and gnashing of teeth about the disintegration of cultural institutions \u2013 an increasingly difficult and at the same time incomprehensible economic situation \u2013 and the vanishing political lobby for so-called 'high culture' is a never-ending phenomenon in Germany. Set against the background of the European and wider economic crisis, the breast-beating is louder than ever.</p> <p>At the same time we should not lose sight of the fact that in Germany the number of diverse cultural institutions supported by public funds is unparalleled worldwide: from grassroots to world class leaders in the field. Attendance figures for classical music concerts, and in particular festivals, are consistently rising. This is due to a growing demand for the 'live experience' in a globalised, digitalised and ever-changing world.</p> <p>Anyone wishing to pursue a career in the performing arts sector will continue to find numerous opportunities to both train and work in Germany, be it as a musician, actor, singer, director or conductor. There has been a sharp increase in courses that specialise in cultural management, cultural education, and cultural studies. Interestingly, the entry requirements for such courses often state that while some musical training is an advantage, it is not a prerequisite.</p> <p>Is a student fully prepared for a career in cultural management, and its increasing challenges, after a two to five year heavily structured and largely practical course? Shouldn't the foundation for musical education and the use of cultural institutions be laid much, much earlier? This question is all the more urgent because, with just a few exceptions, school education in the arts lacks content, rarely motivates students, and often simply does not take place at all, due to lack of resources or a shortage of teachers.</p> <p>As the artistic and managing director of <a href=\"http://en.beethovenfest.de/\" title=\"\">Beethovenfest Bonn</a>, I have, together with my team, given much thought to how we can make our classical music festival accessible to young people with little or no access to the genre or to the procedures of how to run a festival. What began as an experimental pilot project in 2009 has become the award-winning pinnacle of our youth activities, involving more than 4,500 young people: these are the student managers of <a href=\"http://en.beethovenfest.de/schuelerprojekte-junges-beethovenfest/\" title=\"\">the Young Beethovenfest</a>.</p> <p>Following a rigorous interview process, a group of 10 to 15 school students aged 15 to 18 are appointed as student managers and, under the guidance of the permanent festival staff, organise one of the concerts in the festival's main programme. The current intake mirrors all areas of the adult festival including general management, marketing, PR and artistic management.</p> <p>Since January they have been preparing a concert with the German rap star <a href=\"http://www.samy-deluxe.de/\" title=\"\">Samy Deluxe and his Tsunami Band</a>, which will be held in the Deutsche Telekom Forum in September in front of an audience of 1,700. Samy Deluxe will also conduct three day workshops focusing on beatboxing, songwriting, dance and VJ-ing, attended by 200 students from middle schools. The children aged 13 to 15 will perform their work before the main concert, all of which has been organised and will be presented by the student managers.</p> <p>Our experience since 2009 has shown that over a period of nine months, the young 'managers' mature enormously and develop ideas that benefit the whole festival. Their familiarity with social media has opened up new ways for the festival to reach different target groups. In turn the permanent staff of Beethovenfest learn to communicate their own roles to the student managers.</p> <p>The students gain an insight into the organisational processes of the festival and through their own first-hand involvement leave with an understanding of the professionalism and quality that is required to deliver outstanding performances on stage and happy artists backstage. The managers attend a number of Beethovenfest concerts, learn to communicate with artists, agents and sponsors, gain an insight into the difficult conditions in which artists operate on a daily basis and experience the highly competitive market in which Beethovenfest Bonn operates. Crucially, they are treated as equals to the rest of the permanent staff.</p> <p>Back to the beginning: cultural pessimism, wailing and gnashing of teeth are alien to Beethovenfest's student managers. Some of them will certainly become ardent advocates of cultural institutions and their promotion, regardless of whether they end up working in the arts. The Beethovenfest experience cannot be taken away from them.</p> <p>It's up to them how often and for how long they wish to keep in touch. Some have been appointed to sit on selection panels for education projects and others continue to work for us as presenters at youth projects. We are proud that the festival has appointed one of the student managers from the pilot year in 2009 his first job with us at Beethovenfest Bonn as a marketing and event management trainee \u2013 I am certain he will not be the last.</p> <p><em>Ilona Schmiel is artistic and managing director of </em><a href=\"http://www.beethovenfest.de/vorschaltseite/\" title=\"\"><em>Beethovenfest Bonn</em></a><em>, which runs until 7 October 2012 \u2013 follow the festival on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Beethovenfest\" title=\"\"><em>@Beethovenfest</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

He is pursuing Muse's label on the grounds of copyright infringement, unfair trade practices and unfair competition, <a href=\"http://www.entlawdigest.com/2012/09/06/1772.htm\" title=\"\">Courthouse News reported</a>, and has filed papers in Manhattan federal court.</p> <p>\"[The lawsuit is] based on a 'screenplay', which the band never received or saw, produced by someone the band has never heard of,\" Muse said. \"The band is exploring what remedies may be available to them in the US in relation to these untrue and baseless allegations.\"</p> <p>The Resistance, released in 2009, incorporates a three-song suite called Exogenesis. According to Matthew Bellamy's sleevenotes, \"it is a story of humanity coming to an end and everyone pinning their hopes on a group of astronauts who go out to explore space and spread humanity to another planet\". Eventually the astronauts \"realise that it is just one big cycle, and recognise that unless humanity can change it will happen all over again\".</p> <p>Bollfrass alleges this is the same storyline as in his script for Exogenesis. He sent it to Muse hoping they would compose the score; they did not reply until in 2006, he claims, saying they weren't interested. In addition to the similarities in plot, Bollfrass asserts that The Resistance's album cover resembles the storyboards he sent the group.</p> <p>Muse have sold more than a million copies of The Resistance, which topped the album charts in 19 countries. It garnered the band their first Grammy and a Brit nomination for best British band. Muse's sixth studio album, The 2nd Law, is due next month.</p>",
  "<p>We will miss Rowan Williams when he is gone. Not because public life will be the poorer without that beard, those eyebrows: Boris Johnson's blond mop can fill the gap. Not because conservatives and liberals alike will lose a ready scapegoat: there will be others upon whom to load our discontent. But because he is, to my mind, the leading public intellectual of his generation.</p> <p>I know that reading him can be like watching a jellyfish disintegrate in a jacuzzi, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/27/philosophy.society\" title=\"\">as one notable commentator memorably put it</a>. My own version of that experience came after attending his lectures at university. During the series, I bumped into a friend on the high street and exclaimed: \"why weren't you there?\" After an excuse, they asked me what had been said. I stumbled and tried to explain before realising that the great man's words can seem like bright soap bubbles, bursting as they rise in the air. But of this I was sure: I wanted my friend to be there because it was obvious that something important was being aired, something unexpected would be said. Those words came from a place of vitality. Here is someone whom Aristotle would have called megalopsyche or \"great souled\". You want to sit alongside such humans on the rare occasions they come your way, which is presumably why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/feb/23/richard-dawkins-rowan-williams-bout\" title=\"\">even his biggest ideological opponents have done so</a>.</p> <p>It is always worth reading the archbishop for yourself, not how he is redacted in the press. Hoping you might agree, here is what I hear him saying in the new introduction to his collected lectures, <a href=\"http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/articles.php/2535/faith-in-the-public-square-forthcoming-book-by-archbishop-rowan-williams\" title=\"\">Faith in the Public Square</a>, crucial elements lost <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9530382/Archbishop-launches-parting-attack-on-critics.html\" title=\"\">in the reports of last weekend's media</a>.</p> <p>He does criticise the way the economy is run when focused on growth for growth's sake. He does have a pop at his predecessor, Lord Carey, who has complained that Christians are being persecuted in this country. But what is missed in the headlines are the deeper, penetrating points. \"We have been hearing a lot about the dangers of 'aggressive secularism',\" he writes, but that noise obscures the fact that the notion of secularism does not describe where our society is at. (Keeping up the noise presumably suits the \"aggressors\".)</p> <p>Most people do not live in a disenchanted world. Public rituals persist. I write as the Red Arrows fly overhead, celebrating the Olympics. Why do acrobatic jets suit the moment? Is it the roar? The colour? It is hard to say, which is partly why the ritual works. So if we are to progress crucial questions about how society can be organised around a diversity of beliefs, Williams continues, hadn't we better be clearer about where we are actually at?</p> <p>The way he frames his interventions is striking too. To attempt to be a public commentator of any weight, he stresses, is to be doomed to failure. Some will accuse you of straying into their territory. Others will accuse you of platitudinous dumbing down. Others again will make the case for inscrutability. Williams knows he will fail. He signed up to that when he signed up to Christianity because Christianity recognises that failure is what human beings do. And yet, the recognition is not humiliating but liberating \"because it delivers us from aspiring to mythic goals of absolute human control over human destiny\".</p> <p>He practises the risk he preaches. In <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9529526/Archbishop-of-Canterbury-interview-I-dont-think-I-cracked-it.html\" title=\"\">the interview he gave at the weekend</a>, he floated the idea of a president of the Anglican communion to relieve the next archbishop of his global duties. He is undoubtedly right that the job is impossible and will become more undoable. That solution, though, would surely sink the church into further division and squabbles. Can you imagine the power struggle that would ensue in the selection of such a figurehead?</p> <p>In the book, Williams continues: \"The best thing to hope for is that at least some of the inevitable mistakes may be interesting enough (or simply big enough) for someone else to work out better responses.\" Which professional politician would and could express such mitigated optimism? Actually, I suspect Boris conveys a not dissimilar stance and that is part of his appeal. Maybe the hair does matter.</p>",
  "<p>Tate Britain's new Pre-Raphaelites exhibition is a steam-punk triumph, a raw and rollicking resurrection of the attitudes, ideas and passions of our engineering, imperialist, industrialist, capitalist and novel-writing ancestors. The pistons are pounding, the steam is hissing, cigars are being lit and secret lives once more being concealed. The Victorians are back in town. This is as much a costume drama as a show, jam-packed with heroes and villains and innocent victims, holding up a lurid mirror to the age that built Britain.</p> <p>As is the way with costume dramas, it is at once delightful and a bit silly. It delights because the curators really believe in the artistic brilliance of the \"Brotherhood\" and that enthusiasm is infectious. The silliness is inherent in Pre-Raphaelite art, which has some of the relentlessness of a speech by William Gladstone and the timebound detail of a condition-of-England novel by Benjamin Disraeli. You can't have everything.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396020437\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/11/1347366874532/Pre-Raphaelites-Edward-Co-001.jpg\" alt=\"Pre-Raphaelites: Edward Coley Burne-Jones, Laus Veneris 1873-1878\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edward Coley Burne-Jones, Laus Veneris 1873-1878.

I am stopped in my tracks by a portrait of Thomas Fairbairn, painted in 1873-4 by William Holman Hunt, resplendent in a broad black waistcoat, proudly displaying an ample stomach hung with a gold chain. Fairbairn was a Manchester industrialist, who in 1852 led an employers' conspiracy to destroy one of the first unions, the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, yet used his wealth to support the arts. Hunt portrays him in the hippest gallery of the age, the Victoria and Albert Museum in South Kensington.</p> <p>In one of many thoughtful curatorial choices, Fairbairn the capitalist is hung near a portrait of poverty. <a href=\"http://www.preraphaelites.org/the-collection/1936P506/the-stone-breaker/\" title=\"\">The Stonebreaker by Henry Wallis</a> depicts a rural worker ruined by meaningless, exhausting toil.

Isabella's brothers murder her unsuitable lover. Millais suggests these brothers have incestuous designs on their sister: one of them points a white-stockinged leg phallically at Isabella. The foregrounded brothers are creepy in the extreme, but the most villainous faces in Millais' painting belong to a row of respectable bourgeois types who share their dinner table: they radiate the cold propriety of Poor Law guardians. This is a painting about secrets and lies, and Millais makes it a psychodrama full of resonance with the Victorian period.</p> <p>This exhibition bursts with sexuality, like the colossally energetic Victorian WE Gladstone, who had to chop down trees to calm himself. When in 1853 Millais began painting the critic <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2010/jun/20/john-ruskin-john-everett-millais\" title=\"\">John Ruskin</a>, who shared the Pre-Raphaelites' passion for the \"honest\" crafts of the middle ages, he looked on this guru with reverence. Yet the finished portrait, completed a year later, casts him as a tragically enclosed figure among the rushing waters of wild nature. Millais and Ruskin's wife, Effie, had, in the meantime, become lovers. Ruskin's marriage was subsequently annulled, and Effie married Millais.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396020439\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/11/1347367062816/Pre-Raphaelites-John-Ever-001.jpg\" alt=\"Pre-Raphaelites: John Everett Millais, Mariana 1851\" width=\"220\" height=\"270\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Everett Millais, Mariana 1851 Photograph: Tate</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You get the impression, in this exhibition, that the Pre-Raphaelites had a good time because they were the only Victorian men who recognised women as sexual beings.

Dali brings us to a critical question. This is by far the best exhibition of Pre-Raphaelite art I have seen \u2013 but does it make the case that these painters were an \"avant garde\" (the exhibition's subtitle) who helped create modern art?</p> <p>Their work is meticulous to the point of pedantry. The Pre-Raphaelites used this laborious technique to create supercharged, luminous and sometimes genuinely dream-like images such as <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/online/pre-raphaelites/graphics/large/scapegoat.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/online/pre-raphaelites/scapegoat/&amp;h=327&amp;w=475&amp;sz=31&amp;tbnid=Wscoj17Q1LT5LM:&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=131&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__p1-rfe4erF3e3HWmPSYVuGvhOKY=&amp;docid=Pt60C0x9BT7ClM&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c8BNUMONHKGw0QWdlICwAg&amp;ved=0CEQQ9QEwAw&amp;dur=2008\" title=\"\">William Holman Hunt's The Scapegoat</a>. Painted in 1854-46, this unearthly creature, its hair glowing, stands close to the picture surface, surrounded by a salty, desiccated desert that glints with portentous silvers and purples. There is a direct line from Hunt's lurid revelation to the Symbolist art of the late 19th century, and from there to surrealism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396020440\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/11/1347367009047/Pre-Raphaelites-William-H-001.jpg\" alt=\"Pre-Raphaelites: William Holman Hunt\" width=\"220\" height=\"283\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William Holman Hunt, The Lady of Shalott 1886-1905 Wadsworth Altheneum.

A lot of critics disdain this period, and with good cause. The Pre-Raphaelites' paintings exhibit Victorian vices as well as virtues: they can be too sleek, too complacent in their reliance on artistic formulae \u2013 as if there were a <a href=\"http://www.mrsbeeton.com/\" title=\"\">Mrs Beeton recipe</a> for greatness. The reason their art works so well in the massive quantities on display here is partly because, frankly, I don't think you can look at one Pre-Raphaelite painting for too long. That bold, hard brightness is captivating on first view but palls, being so sealed within its own aesthetic bubble.</p> <p>Where it has me hooked is in its Dickensian or Hardyesque appetite for the drama of Victorian life.

  "<p>As many kids have done before me, I lapped up Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when primary-school age. However, when I tried to tune in to the evening ITV show <a href=\"http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/861\" title=\"\">Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected</a>, I was forcibly ejected from the sitting room by my parents. The 70s title sequence of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqAavKou7Ck\" title=\"\">curvy female silhouettes dirty-dancing against a red background</a> was enough to signal to them that this smut was not for me.</p> <p>Thirty odd years on, the \"national treasure\" status of this complex character best known for his prolific children's fiction is now assured. It may not yet be printed in your average week-at-a-view desk diary but 13 September is <a href=\"http://www.roalddahlday.info/\" title=\"\">Roald Dahl Day</a>.</p> <p>I've recently re-familiarised myself with Dahl's junior output through my eight-year-old. The story CDs recorded in his own seductively velvety tones are a handy kids' bedtime device for their soporific quality. Now his often overlooked adult content \u2013 the thought of which so horrified my folks \u2013 is also being <a href=\"http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Search/QuickSearchProc/1,,,00.html?strSearch=Roald+Dahl&amp;searchProfile=UK-590614-global&amp;advSearchStr=&amp;adv=0&amp;retainableText=Roald%20Dahl&amp;path=&amp;textSearch=Roald%20Dahl&amp;homeNav=&amp;travel=&amp;sortBy=pubdateDsc\" title=\"\">reissued as audiobooks</a>, fittingly read by a brace of national treasures.</p> <p>Even if his best-known books date from the 1960s onwards, Dahl can still command headlines. When his supermodel granddaughter Sophie appeared on Radio 4's Today programme last year, the public were outraged that she seemed to be asking for public funding for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/sep/13/roald-dahl-fund-hut\" title=\"\">restoration of his writing hut</a>. The issue has since been resolved, and as part of Roald Dahl day the interior of the outbuilding has been <a href=\"http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/9599742.Roald_Dahl_s_Writing_Hut_goes_on_display_today/\" title=\"\">recreated</a> at the Roald Dahl Museum in his hometown of Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, funded by the family and his charitable foundation. The saga's twists and turns were meticulously covered by specialist site <a href=\"http://www.shedworking.co.uk/2011/09/controversy-rages-over-restoration-of.html\" title=\"\">Shedworking</a>.</p> <p>This controversy is absent from Michael Rosen's <a href=\"http://www.puffinvirtuallylive.co.uk/author/roalddahlday\" title=\"\">new biography</a> \u2013 perhaps unsurprisingly given that it is published by children's imprint Puffin Books. Rosen includes new archival material \u2013 school photos and letters to Mama from his war hero and boarding school days. It's a warm portrait that largely concentrates on his young life and doesn't dwell on episodes like the breakdown of his first marriage because, as his publicist points out, it's primarily for 8- to 10-year-olds. Adult biographer Jeremy Treglown meanwhile labels Dahl \"a fantasist, an anti-semite, a bully and a self publicising trouble-maker\" and describes his extensive sexual liaisons when working in the US.</p> <p>It's the books themselves that fascinate most though: his adult material is not for prudes. The \"horny\" character Uncle Oswald, \"the greatest fornicator of all time\", gets a novel to himself and pops up in Switch Bitch \u2013 a collection of short stories that originally appeared in Playboy. In Bitch, following a scientific experiment to produce a scent that stimulates sexual attraction, he turns into a seven-feet penis that floats into space, declaring \"But tell me truly, did you ever see / a sexual organ quite so grand as me?\".</p> <p>There are running themes of vice and eroticism and as well as the darker cruel exploits and moralistic comeuppence that are familiar from his kids novels. The Great Switcheroo is a tale of wife swapping for a one-off darkened sex session between neighbouring couples without the wives knowing. Chocolate manufacturing or oversized peaches this ain't, but then again these stories were designed for an adolescent male audience in a pre-politically correct age where casual misogyny went more unnoticed than now.</p> <p>Hagiography is usually reserved for those who have departed us. Roald Dahl Day festivities are taking place at various venues across two countries. The <a href=\"http://www.norwegianchurchcardiff.com/content.asp?nav=160&amp;parent_directory_id=2&amp;id=707&amp;Language=\" title=\"\">Norwegian Church Arts Centre in Cardiff</a>, where Dahl was christened, has a day of activities. There is also a Roald Dahl gallery of the nearby Aylesbury County Museum, which recently ran a <a href=\"http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/bcc/museum/dahl_gallery/dahl_childrens_gallery.page?\" title=\"\">Roald Dahl festival</a>..</p> <p>His work may not be as zeitgeisty as EL James's Fifty Shades trilogy, but with amassed UK sales upwards of 37m books and more than a million of them shifted every year, Dahl still sells by the shed-load. Nonetheless, in the runup to Roald Dahl day some 22 years after his death, perhaps the two authors are not as far removed from each other as one might initially think.</p>",
  "<p>Ed Miliband has announced that Labour has a <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/labours-new-agenda\" title=\"\">\"new agenda\"</a>, a new central big idea that will drive its economic message in the runup to the next general election. It may not have the snappiest name, but the idea of predistribution is a potentially powerful one. Much will depend on the directions in which it is developed, and whether Labour embraces a weak or a radical version of the politics of predistribution.</p> <p>The core meaning of predistribution is simple to grasp. As the term's progenitor, Yale political scientist Jacob Hacker <a href=\"http://www.policy-network.net/pno_detail.aspx?ID=3998&amp;title=The+institutional+foundations+of+middle-class+democracy\" title=\"\">puts it</a>, the aim of predistribution is \"to focus on market reforms that encourage a more equal distribution of economic power and rewards even before government collects taxes or pays out benefits\". Instead of equalising unfair market outcomes through tax-and-spend or tax-and-transfer, we instead engineer markets to create fairer outcomes from the beginning.</p> <p>One could see this approach as the politics of the second-best. Now that the recession has made it impossible to help the disadvantaged by the old strategy of skimming-off a small part of the proceeds of growth, here's a way of doing it on the cheap. Indeed, Hacker sees predistribution as a way for social democrats to accommodate their ambitions to a more hostile world. In a world of weak economies, there is less need to raise revenue; and in a world of scepticism about government spending and hostility to taxation, there is less need for social democrats to change people's minds.</p> <p>No doubt there is much that governments can do to foster greater equality in market outcomes without spending money. The concrete measures that Miliband has advanced, from capping rail price increases, to legislating for a living wage, from changing government procurement rules to encourage vocational training, to putting workers' representatives on corporate remuneration committees, are all workable, worthwhile policies.</p> <p>But the real question is how far down this line Labour will be willing to go. As economists <a href=\"http://michaelkumhof.weebly.com/\" title=\"\">Michael Kumhof</a> and <a href=\"http://www.romainranciere.com/\" title=\"\">Romain Ranci\u00e8re</a> argue, in research published by the IMF, the best way of significantly flattening pre-tax inequalities is to raise the bargaining power of wage-earners. That means the government strengthening trade unions and collective bargaining arrangements. It's a classic predistributive policy. But it's outside the comfort zone of the more uncontroversial forms of predistribution, and shows that the politics of predistribution cannot be an innocuous or uncontroversial.</p> <p>There is also an older and more radical approach to predistribution in the history of social democracy, even if it once went by another name. The Nobel prize-winning economist James Meade, in his 1964 book Efficiency, Equality and the Ownership of Property, championed the idea of a systematic regime of predistributive policies, which he called a \"property-owning democracy\". Despite the term's subsequent associations with the right and in particular with Margaret Thatcher's sell-off of council housing, Meade's version of a property-owning democracy was conceived as a stage in the development of social democracy beyond the welfare state.</p> <p>Meade's property-owning democracy would go beyond the constraints of redistributive policies by looking fundamentally to change individuals' economic power within markets. It would do this by significant redistribution of control over both human and non-human capital. Meade's approach to predistribution thus involved a society where social justice was promoted not only by raising wages through substantial investment in education and training, but also by giving every citizen a capital stake, along the lines of a supercharged version of the baby bond that George Osborne threw onto the scrapheap.</p> <p>Meade's idea was later taken up and further developed by the political philosopher John Rawls, in work published during the final period of his career. Rawls argued that predistribution in a property-owning democracy wasn't a second-best strategy for creating social justice, but was in fact far superior to traditional forms of welfare-state redistribution.</p> <p>Predistribution of human capital, through education and training, fosters self-respect and economic agency, while predistribution of capital stakes gives people the kind of independence that comes with being less in thrall to the vagaries of the labour market. Those with a more secure economic position are free to refuse demeaning or badly paid jobs, and this in turn bids-up wages and reduces inequality.</p> <p>Meade and Rawls, the two outstanding theorists of predistribution, conjure a vision not just of tinkering at the edges of current market outcomes, but of fundamentally changing the distribution of economic power in society. While both look to reduce the month-to-month taxation and redistribution of incomes, they nevertheless agree that real predistribution involves the aggressive taxation of wealth, through taxes on capital holdings and transfers, and especially on inheritance. Real, radical forms of predistribution do not so much allow governments to tax less in absolute terms; rather, they require a fundamental shift in the focus of taxation from income to wealth.</p> <p>In its more radical forms, predistribution is a potentially inspiring project for social democrats who have come to see the limitations of the old ways of doing things. It's a project that promises a strategy to deliver abundantly on values of social justice, economic freedom, and equality of opportunity. But it's a project that involves going head-to-head with entrenched interests, breaking up existing concentrations of wealth and economic power. The politics of predistribution, if taken seriously, simply cannot be a politics without enemies.</p>",

Here is a summary of the main points from the hearing.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Gove said that Welsh pupils would suffer as a result of<a href=\"http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2012/09/11/leighton-andrews-orders-wjec-to-regrade-english-language-gcse-results-91466-31814517/\"> the Welsh government\u2019s decision to order GCSE results to be regraded </a>because in future employers would not value their qualifications as much as English ones.</strong> He said Leighton Andrews, the Labour education minster in the Welsh government, was being \u201cirresponsible\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I believe that the children who have been disadvantaged are children in Wales. I think the decision by the Welsh education minister, Leighton Andrews, is irresponsible and mistaken. And I think that he has undermined confidence in Welsh children\u2019s GCSEs and I think that he should think again having made what I regard to be a regrettable political intervention in what should be a process free from political meddling ...</p> <p>He\u2019s in the wrong and the Welsh children are suffering. The difficulty, as pointed out by Ofqual yesterday, is that the same exam by the same board was sat by children either side of the English/Welsh border. Children in Wales did appreciably worse than children in England sitting the same exam. That reinforces what every interntional survey shows, which is that children in Wales have suffered as a result of education policies put forward by Labour politicians which have abolished league tables, ended the objective assessment of children at the end of key stage two and ensured that there is less rigour in the approach towards eduction.</p> <p>Now, finding himself in a fix and his education system in the dock, a Labour politician has attempted to shift blame. I think that is irresponsible and the children who suffer are the children from Wales who when they apply for jobs in England will hand over certificates which profess to be good passes and English employers will now say: \u201cI fear, through no fault of your own - I\u2019m sure you\u2019re the right person to be employed - but I cannot count your exam pass as equivalent to this other exam pass.\u201d And I think to have made the decision that he did, with the speed that he did, without appropriate consultation with Ofqual, was irresponsible and children in Wales, not just this year but in the future.</p> </blockquote> <p>Graham Stuart, the Conservative chairman of the committee, said immediately after Gove finished these remarks that he agreed with 95% of them.</p> <p>Andrews explained his decision to order a regrading <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/09/michael-gove-does-not-own-gcse-brand-we-do\">in a powerful post on the New Statesman blog yesterday. </a>He said that as a result of Gove's decisions the exam system in the UK was fragmenting. \"We will, inevitably now I think, end up with largely separate exam systems in Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland,\" he wrote.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He implicitly criticised the Lib Dems for refusing to accept that England already has a two-tier qualification system at GCSE.</strong> Gove wants to replace GCSEs with something similar to the old O-level, but <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/03/cameron-cabinet-reshuffle-politics-live1#block-504496d958f956c1a416afa7\">the Lib Dems have been insisting that the single-tier system must be preserved and that there must be no return to the era of O-levels for able children and CSEs for less able children.</a> But Gove said the GCSE was a two-tier qualification.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The truth is that we already have a two-tier qualification system because of this distinction between the foundation and higher tiers ... I\u2019m not sure that many people outside the education world do know that there are two different types of GCSE, one of them the equivalent of the old CSE. You put people in for it, they cannot get better than a C, in the same way as top grade in an old CSE entitled you to an old O-level pass. I think it\u2019s wrong because it is an inherent cap on aspiration.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that grade inflation over recent years have been \u201cunfair\u201d on pupils.</strong> When he warned about the dangers of grade inflation when he was shadow education secretary, the then Labour government said he was \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201cwicked\u201d because he was denigrating children\u2019s achievements, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, now that view has become the consensus ... And the children who have suffered are those children who every year have to endure a questioning of the credibility of their examinations, which is unfair on them and unfair on the teachers.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said under Labour Ofqual took a decision to lower grade boundaries to make it easier for pupils to pass science exams.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that the education committee was the best body best equipped to carry out an inquiry into the GCSE grading controversy.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He refused to condemn ministers leaking information to the media.</strong> Asked if this was unacceptable, he said: \u201cI take a philosophical attitude towards leaks ... I think it\u2019s no use crying over spilt milk.\u201d The subject came up because it is widely assumed at Westminster that Gove was responsible for the fact that leaked detials of his plans to abolish GCSEs appeared in the Daily Mail earlier this year. Asked if he had ever leaked details of a a major announcement, Gove gave an evasive answer; he said that ministers took people into their confidence, and sometimes they could not control what those people did with the information.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said he had \u201cno idea\u201d if leaking by ministers was covered by the ministerial code.</strong> Stuart, the committee chairman, said he was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d by this admission.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-505059b2c0e37a1aa8682a16\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-12T09:45:23.744Z\">10.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The committee is now asking Gove about policy relating to children.

For example, there were leaks about school building cuts. Legal advice was leaked. Private correspondence was leaked. His wife's private email advice was published on the front page of the Financial Times.</p> <p>Stuart says the committee deplores this. But will Gove deplore all leaks.</p> <p>Gove says it would not be conducive to the conduct of government to \"look back in anger\".</p> <p>Q: What sanction are there for ministers who leak to the media?</p> <p>Gove says he has no idea?</p> <p>Q: So you don't know about the ministerial code?</p> <p>Gove says he talks to many people. He should not waste his time worying about how is responsible for leaks.</p> <p>Q: So you seem to think it is alright for you to leak, because other people will leak against you?</p> <p>Gove says this is part of political life.</p> <p>Q: Would you leak information about a major announcement.</p> <p>Gove says he is not going to speculate about how ministers handle these matters. Ministers take people into their confidence. What they do with that information is a matter for them.</p> <p>Q: So you don't rule out major initiatives being leaked to the press?</p> <p>Gove says he won't comment, because they would be seen as a criticism of other departments.</p> <p>Stuart says Gove does not seem to be aware of what the ministerial code says about that. That \"flabbergasts me\", Stuart says.</p> <p>Gove says major announcements should be made to parliament first.</p> <p>But, when policy is being discussed, there are frank discussions. He would hope people will respect that confidence. But sometimes that confidence is breached. He won't say anything that could be interpreted as a criticism of other ministers.</p> <p>His ability to present information to parliament has been damaged by leaks. But he is not going to \"look back in anger\", he says.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5050575b58f98e4e461a862b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-12T09:35:24.805Z\">10.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The BBC has now put up a story on its website about<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-19569429\"> Michael Gove accusing Leighton Andrews, the Labour education minister in Wales, of harming the interests of Welsh pupils by insisting on their results being regraded.</a></p> <p>Here's the top of the story.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Education Secretary Michael Gove has attacked his Welsh counterpart as \"irresponsible and mistaken\" for ordering disputed GCSEs to be regraded.</p> <p>Mr Gove has been giving evidence to the education select committee's investigation into head teachers' claims of unfair GCSE grades.</p> <p>He told MPs that raising Welsh pupils' grades would \"undermine confidence\" in the value of their qualifications.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5050569ec0e37a1aa8682a13\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-12T09:32:37.434Z\">10.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Gove says he is glad the last government raised the school leaving age from 16.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5050565dc0e37a1aa8682a12\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-12T09:31:15.855Z\">10.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Damian Hinds</strong>, a Conservative, is asking the questions now.</p> <p><em>Q: Doesn't the exam system need to be reformed?</em></p> <p>Yes, says Gove.</p> <p>When he launched a debate about reforming GCSEs, people said they did not want a two-tier system.</p> <p>But they did not realise that there is already a two-tier system.

  "<p>Now here's a funny thing \u2013 a history of the music hall by a former Conservative prime minister. Former PMs and party leaders have tended to write books about highly respectable subjects (and themselves, of course). But John Major \u2013 an unusual politician and unusual PM \u2013 has written, in honour of his dear old dad, an uncommon book about one of the most extraordinary, vital and creative chapters in British theatrical history, another influential contribution to world culture improbably emanating from this tiny island.</p> <p>He has his work cut out. Music hall is a notoriously elusive subject. It emerged from the semi-legitimate underbelly of the 18th-century London entertainment scene, from upper-class dining clubs and middle-class taverns and working-class so-called penny gaffs. This is what Major strikingly calls \"the pre-natal life of music hall\". There was always, from the beginning, a sense of transgression, the saying of the unsayable, the thinking of the unthinkable. Sometimes this simply meant hair-raising levels of ribaldry, sometimes stark truths about city life, sometimes mad flights of verbal and visual fantasy. Sometimes it was directly political, such as the mock trials, with \"barristers\" and \"juries\". Eventually, with licensees dancing around the vagaries of the authorities, dedicated establishments sprang up \u2013 the original music halls, which were often little more than that, simple venues where popular music could be heard by a hard-drinking clientele.</p> <p>The alcoholic and the artistic were always closely linked: some performers were paid a bonus of a penny for every pint that was drunk, and many of them were simply paid in kind with booze, which swiftly curtailed their lives. Once the commercial possibilities of the halls were established, by the mid-1850s, smart entrepreneurs such as <a href=\"http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Morton.htm\" title=\"\">Charles Morton</a> built increasingly splendid theatres, offering excellent food and fine wines in safe and sumptuous surroundings. They also sought to tap into the respectable, especially that holy grail of impresarios, the family audience. In time this would inhibit the free and raucous expression of the early days, but that element was never entirely expunged. At its glorious high noon, from the 1870s through to the beginning of the first world war, it was a unique mix of social comment, sexual innuendo, musical brilliance, physical poetry and visual spectacle. It celebrated the grotesque, the defiant, the carnival; above all it was about personality and the give-and-take between stage and stalls. It was frequented by all classes, chronicled by great writers, admired by creative geniuses. <a href=\"http://ttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkEUHawaAZ4\" title=\"\">Stravinsky wrote a piece inspired by Little Tich</a>, whom Nijinsky idolised; Debussy told the young Chaplin, \"<em>M Chaplin, vous \u00eates un artiste</em>.\" From 1914, the decline was steady, brought on by a combination of ruthless central control by a handful of managers, the development of new forms, such as jazz, above all by the encroachment of the new media of radio, film and, delivering the final coup de gr\u00e2ce, television.</p> <p>All this has been told before, and told well, by <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Music_hall_nights.html?id=woA0AAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\" title=\"\">Dion Clayton</a>, by <a href=\"http://www.arts-humanities.net/projects/mander_mitchenson_theatre_collection_enhancing_access_research\" title=\"\">Mander and Mitchenson</a>, by <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Funny-Way-Hero-John-Fisher/dp/0584100973\" title=\"\">John Fisher (in the wonderful <em>Funny Way to Be a Hero</em></a>) and by Colin MacInnes in his superb elegy <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Funny-Way-Hero-John-Fisher/dp/0584100973\" title=\"\"><em>Sweet Saturday Night</em></a>. But Major has a motive in telling the story again. It is, he says, a final encore for his mother and father, Tom and Gwen Major; Tom was 64 when John was born, so his career stretches back, if not to the heyday of the halls, at least to a time when that heyday was a living memory. His account of the music hall is tinged with deep filial affection for the lives of performers and the conditions in which they worked.</p> <p>As might be expected, he is especially acute on the political and social dimensions of the phenomenon: he notes, perhaps approvingly, that audiences in the 1870s often supported the Conservatives, \"who under Disraeli had cut the hours of work, while Gladstone's Liberals had cut the hours of drink\". And he quotes that anomaly, <a href=\"http://www.amaranthdesign.ca/musichall/past/robey.htm\" title=\"\">the comedian-philosopher George Robey</a>: \"The man who gets to the top [in England] is almost treated like a usurper. The man who gets kicked to the ground is regarded as almost a saint \u2026 what we are witnessing is the deification of inefficiency.\" He has a fine chapter about the 1894 attempt by the National Vigilance Association (under the superbly named Mrs Ormiston Chant) to persuade the London County Council to oust prostitutes from the music halls by closing down the Promenade in the Empire Leicester Square; the audience rebelled. The Promenade, where people could move around freely, was the last vestige of the loose and raffish origins of the music hall.</p> <p>Major has an interesting aside about the presence of rent boys among the audience: even in the centre of London, the music hall was only a step away from the demi-monde. Of course it was: the theatre is always about display, about bodies, about flesh and blood. Major spares a kind word for Mrs Chant, but his sympathy is with the performers.</p> <p>As it always is in this rich, generous book. He never moralises, but always celebrates. The art of evoking dead performers is a very tricky one, and sometimes it eludes him. Nothing can bring <a href=\"http://www.besmark.com/lauder.html\" title=\"\">the kilted Scot Harry Lauder</a>, the most famous and (richest) of all music hall artists, back from the dead; and Major rather throws in the towel with <a href=\"http://www.btinternet.com/~radical/thefolkmag/vesta.htm\" title=\"\">Vesta Tilley</a> (\"she was, quite simply, supreme\"). But elsewhere he sends in the clowns quite brilliantly, parading them before us in all their extraordinariness. Boys pretending to be girls, men pretending to be women, women pretending to be men, white men pretending to be black men \u2013 a sort of reverse universe: Little Tich, 4ft 6in tall, a curiosity from birth, having an extra finger on each hand, double-jointed, pigeon-toed, overweight, and who stopped growing at the age of 10, described by <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/249037/Lucien-Guitry\" title=\"\">Lucien Guitry</a> as the world's greatest genius; the young <a href=\"http://www.rfwilmut.clara.net/musichll/xleno.html\" title=\"\">Dan Leno</a>, billed as \"Little George, Infant Wonder Contortionist and Posturer\" \u2013 no wonder Dickens loved him (he said of the Infant Phenomenon that he would \"make headway\"); <a href=\"http://www.amaranthdesign.ca/musichall/past/cheval.htm\" title=\"\">Albert Chevalier</a>, author of \"My Old Dutch\", the prince of costers, christened Albert Onesime Britannicus Gwathveoyd Louis Chevalier, known as the Kipling of the Halls.</p> <p>Major is especially strong on the women. He writes movingly of<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Hill_(music_hall_performer)\" title=\"\"> Jenny Hill </a>(1848\u201396): \"She was more than a great performer \u2013 she was a feminist trail-blazer, a professional success, at a time when women could neither vote nor borrow money without a male guarantor; when the professions were closed to them and their only employment choices were low-paid factory or shop-work, or domestic service. Jenny Hill not only earned success on her own merits, she remained in control of her career: there were no Svengalis for her. She did it her way, and took the knocks.\" He quotes one of her many searing lyrics, which suggest a performer on the brink of the Blues: \"I've been a good woman to you / And the neighbours all know that it's true / You go to the pub / You 'blue' the kids' grub&#xa0;/ But I've been a good woman to you.\" This is a discovery: I had never heard of her, but Vesta Tilley described her as \"the greatest artist we ever had on the variety stage\". Major is wonderfully warm-hearted about Marie Lloyd and her audience: \"She made mistakes in her life \u2013 as they&#xa0;did. She drank \u2013 as many of them did. She loved unwisely \u2013 as many of them did. Her language could be basic \u2013 as theirs was. She lived their lives vividly and in public \u2013 and they loved her for it.\"</p> <p>In judgments, or non-judgments, such as these, Major shows himself to be compassionate and in touch, as the phrase goes, with real life. Uncommon politician indeed. He is fascinating about the cross-dresser Anne Hindle, who married, under the name Charlie Hindle, her dresser, Sarah; and tellingly quotes <a href=\"http://www.musichallcds.co.uk/cdr12_page.htm\" title=\"\">Ella Shields's great number, \"Burlington Bertie\"</a>, a sublime example of popular poetry: \"I'm all airs and graces, correct easy paces&#xa0;/ Without food for so long, I've forgot where my face is.\" Shields, Major notes with satisfaction, \"died in 1952, aged 73, after collapsing on stage from a heart attack in front of three thousand people at a holiday camp in Margate\", one of the few happy and not untimely deaths in the annals of music hall.</p> <p>Major nobly honours his parents and they life they lived in these pages. The affection is palpable and anything but pious. \"Whatever the deprivations \u2026 it was a world full of life, with each performance a kaleidoscope of colour and contradiction: the beautiful and the bizarre; the glamorous and the grotesque; the romantic and the raffish; the comedic and the crude.\" In short, he gets it.

  "<p>It seems scarcely credible that when the three surviving members of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/ledzeppelin\" title=\"\">Led Zeppelin</a> reunited for their one-off show in London in 2007, 20 million people applied for tickets. Though they bestrode the world like a priapic, all-devouring monster of depravity in the 1970s, the years following their split in 1980 \u2013 caused by the death of drummer John Bonham \u2013 were not kind to them. Critical orthodoxy held them to be dinosaurs, representatives of all that was worst about rock excess in both behaviour and music.</p> <p>Offstage, one horrific tale holds that some combination of members of the band and their road crew whiled away an evening in a Seattle hotel inserting <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_episode\" title=\"\">fish of disputed species</a> into a woman's vagina. Onstage, Nick Hornby recalls in his book <em>31 Songs</em> a guitar solo so long he was able to leave Earl's Court arena, pop to the pub for a pint and a game of pool and return before the end of it. The band's reputation was further diminished by a disastrous, under-rehearsed appearance at Live Aid in 1985, which they did not allow to be included on the 2004 DVD release of the concerts.</p> <p>Barney Hoskyns's exhaustive history doesn't skimp on the horror \u2013 and by God, there's enough of it \u2013 but nor does it turn Led Zeppelin into a cartoon of decadence. It never forgets that behind the caricature was a wonderful band, lithe and limber, never the lumpen metal pioneers that they are sometimes branded. Where most bands can be reduced to guitarist, singer and supporting cast, all of Zeppelin's four members \u2013 as Hoskyns's 128 interviewees, including the band and intimates, as well as close observers, make clear \u2013 were crucial in making them extraordinary.</p> <p>The heart of Zeppelin's story is the relationship between Jimmy Page, the guitarist who formed the band in 1968, and <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-05-15/five-lessons-from-musics-most-feared-manager-led-zeppelins-peter-grant\" title=\"\">their manager, Peter Grant</a>. Grant was desperately protective of his band, and succeeded in altering the balance of the music industry in favour of artists, at least those powerful enough to wrest control from the promoters and labels who had previously made the lion's share of the money. In the process of doing so, though, he became powerful himself, and was corrupted absolutely in the process.</p> <p>Page authorised and trusted Grant to do anything to protect the group's interests, and as the pair got more and more heavily involved in drugs in the late 1970s, so the deeds so casually committed in Zeppelin's name \u2013 threats of violence, actual violence, near-blackmail of business associates \u2013 became more and more appalling. \"There's a one-word answer: cocaine,\" says one of the band's press liaison people of the air of menace that surrounded them by 1977. \"Or another related word: paranoia. Peter and Jimmy were the most paranoid people I have ever met in my life, bar none.\"</p> <p>Rock mythology holds that Page was somehow a \"dark\" force: he collected occult books and artefacts, bought Aleister Crowley's old mansion and opened an occult shop. But it seems less likely that Page's behaviour was caused by some sort of deal with Satan than him apparently being a fairly nasty piece of work, selfish and mean and manipulative.</p> <p>When your reputation is being defended by a former teenage groupie on the grounds that you did not actually laugh while she was being assaulted by another teenage groupie, you've probably lost all contact with normal levels of acceptable behaviour. Not that he was alone: one of Hoskyns's chapters opens with the instructions to journalists covering their 1977 US tour: \"1 Never talk to anyone in the band unless they first talk to you. 1A Do not make any sort of eye contact with John Bonham. This is for your own safety.\"</p> <p>If there's a hero in <em>Trampled Under Foot</em>, it's Zeppelin's singer, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/robert-plant\" title=\"\">Robert Plant</a>, portrayed as the light to Page's darkness. His discomfort with what the band became is evident, intensified after the death of his five-year-old son in July 1977. But still, across page after page, one can't help but think: he was there, why didn't he do something? It's a point made by someone present at one of the most notorious incidents in the band's history, when a security guard was twice badly beaten up backstage at a gig in Oakland: \"Plant seemed like the only decent human being there, although there were no innocents. There were no innocents.\"</p> <p>So why did those 20 million people apply for tickets in 2007? The answer lies in the records to which this book sent me scurrying back: in the sinuous, thrilling interplay of instruments in \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_cYrx1TxMY\" title=\"\">Nobody's Fault But Mine</a>\"; the preposterous bombast of \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW_WLxseq0o\" title=\"\">Kashmir</a>\"; the magnificent idiocy of \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNhD0oS5pk\" title=\"\">The Immigrant Song</a>\" (\"The hammer of the gods will drive our ships to new lands!\"); the brutal combination of 60s freakbeat and proto-metal in \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5PvAi8PTsI\" title=\"\">Communication Breakdown</a>\". It's the songs that made Led Zeppelin the biggest band in the world; and it was being the biggest band in the world that made them a horror show.</p>",
  "<p>As curriculum leader of <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/classroomgeography\">Priory Geography</a> department, I am privileged to be able to see my colleagues deliver many high quality lessons that utilise technology every day. So, when asked to write about my best tech lesson I decided early on to focus on some of the ideas that have spanned not only my classroom but moved into others. We are well known for our creative and naughty approach to learning.</p> <p>Of course, I could have included an example from our Bring Your Own Device policy, tablets, mobile learning and other 'wizz bang' stuff, but, from experience, many looking to expand their use of technology in the classroom can find such tales intimidating as well as inspirational. Instead, I'm going to share a few stories of where the use of simple, freely available tools during typical lessons within our department have been utilised to enhance students' learning. From the outset, the important thing to remember here that these are relatively simple ideas that have had a big impact. We designed the learning first and then find the technology to help us deliver what we'd like not the other way around. I should also add that our work has been heavily influenced by others.</p> <p>We often find ourselves wanting to make a visual impact when introducing a new topic. Inspectors are on the lookout for student independence and collaboration, but we all know that needs a spark. We use a combination of Flickr and internet radio stations. When introducing Thailand to year 8, we simply type the country name into the search function and hit <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com//search/show/?q=thailand\">slideshow</a>. We combine this with an <a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/Thailand-r101304/\">internet radio station</a> to challenge students to identify the country and it's main features as seen through the eyes of Flickr users. What aspects of the country are missing? What are the similarities? What evidence is there? Does the place look inviting, scary or inspiring? Is this place really like this?</p> <p>This approach has led into creative writing pieces and does engage pupils' senses. The important thing is not to show the learning objectives first. Writing \"we are learning about Thailand\" on the board would simply spoil the fun.</p> <p>Next, in geography, it's always important to build up some background information about a place so we'd get students racing to find some. The class are split in two. One group only have access to the internet and the other traditional atlases. We call out challenges such as \"What is the GDP per capita of Thailand?\" and the students race to find the information. The discrepancies and relative advantages and disadvantages of both are immediately obvious and it's possible illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of both methods. Developing this understanding of different media in our students is very important to us. What's surprising is that students often choose the atlas.</p> <p>Now we have engaged our students in asking questions and allowed them to find some basic information it's time to introduce the geographical enquiry. We inject a real audience and sense of purpose by asking our own, personal Facebook and Twitter networks what they'd like to know about Thailand and how'd they'd like the information presented. The result of this is usually a wide range of questions that can be allocated to paired young people and a range of requests. The resulting work is shared with the wider world.</p> <p>Using such simple ideas that require the relatively simple classroom tools of an internet-connected PC and digital projector leads to greater innovation and builds confidence. For example, there are 37 different languages spoken by our students at home. So we decided to highlight the issue by delivering a whole lesson through all of these languages, avoiding English. Students had to use their own mobile devices to translate the instructions before using coordinates on a virtual map of the world that had been superimposed over our school. The result has been fantastic learning opportunities, but teachers can only move toward more innovative approaches by building confidence by succeeding in using simple ideas first.</p> <p>Being a geography department, getting out into the field not only makes our subject unique but also allows us to develop essential skills. Students' own devices and our own tablets enhance data collection and we use a blend of traditional paper based techniques and those that use handheld devices. For example, most devices have some sort of voice recording facility. Our students use this to record what they see as first hand observation is a valid form of data collection. Couple this with the <a href=\"http://photosynth.net/\">Photosynth</a> app and it's possible to record the characteristics of a place in some detail. Our students have created <a href=\"http://daviderogers.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/live-blogging-from-field.html\">live blogs</a> from the field to record learning and used the <a href=\"http://skitch.com/\">Skitch app</a> to annotate images for later use in GCSE classroom sessions.</p> <p>I hope that you can see a common theme running through this collection of ideas.

  "<p>Apparently this England side are now officially the third best international team in the world. Or, at least, that is what Fifa would like us to believe through its increasingly perplexing ranking system. The whole process is flawed, to say the least, and certainly on nights like these Roy Hodgson's players remind everyone that their shortcomings are not merely a matter of fine-tuning.</p> <p>Beating Moldova is one thing, but England cannot expect to get very far if they continue to be this dishevelled, and for the captain Steven Gerrard there was a particularly unsatisfactory conclusion to a night in which it needed a Frank Lampard penalty, three minutes from the end, to spare Hodgson the near-certainty of seeing and hearing his team being booed off at Wembley.</p> <p>England still managed to make it a dispiriting finish, however, courtesy of Gerrard's scything challenge on Denys Garmash a minute after Lampard's equaliser. The captain had already been booked for an elbowing offence that split open Ruslan Rotan's cheek in the second half and which might have earned a red card on its own. There is no great hardship in him missing the match against San Marino next month, but a player of his vast experience should be above this kind of risk-taking. More than anything, he should have realised the dangers of testing a referee who had already shown the yellow card eight times.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zq7m6CelQus?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zq7m6CelQus?list=UUTxrQtgYzHRNAliCPIKov-Q&amp;hl=en_US\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>England did at least show a measure of competitive spirit to drag themselves back into the game after Evhen Konoplyanka's brilliant 38th-minute effort, and Hodgson is entitled to reflect that his second-half substitutions helped provide more impetus in an attacking sense. Daniel Welbeck, in particular, was lively and he and Ryan Bertrand were both involved in the move that led to Evhen Khacheridi's handball giving Lampard the chance to score the 26th goal of his international career, drawing level with Bryan Robson in the process.</p> <p>For the most part, however, this was a night when some familiar old failings could be detected in terms of England looking lethargic in possession. This is clearly still a work in progress, as might be expected given that this is relatively speaking a period of experimentation for Hodgson, but it was alarming all the same. Ukraine, for the record, lie 39th in Fifa's rankings. The supposed differential between the sides was seldom evident.</p> <p>Against Moldova, Hodgson's players had been allowed to dictate the rhythm of the game almost from the off. Ukraine, in stark contrast, were far more refined and quickly made it clear they wanted retribution for a controversial 1-0 defeat at Euro 2012. Their habit of feigning injuries was not particularly becoming and, on that theme, England had legitimate grievances about the manner in which their opponents took the lead.</p> <p>Equally, though, Hodgson was being generous in the extreme when he argued afterwards that it was an accomplished and encouraging England performance.</p> <p>Tom Cleverley had a disappointing game featuring two bad misses and was substituted just after the hour, which seemed a far cry from Hodgson billing him, post-Moldova, as England's equivalent of Cesc F\u00e1bregas. Joleon Lescott was notably poor, at fault for the Ukraine goal, and Phil Jagielka was also susceptible in a defence that missed John Terry and Ashley Cole. Alex Oxalde-Chamberlain and James Milner offered little penetration on the flanks. The football, for long spells, was very much like the noise conjured up by the England supporters' band \u2013 drab and uninspiring.</p> <p>The flip side was that England could reflect they also squandered some excellent chances. Ukraine's goal, for example, came a couple of minutes after Jermain Defoe headed across the six-yard area and Cleverley, sliding in, had the goal gaping only for his shot to rebound off the goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov's foot.</p> <p>Reprieved, Ukraine worked the ball from right to left, culminating in Konoplyanka taking over 30 yards out, cutting inside Gerrard and unleashing a swerving, diagonal shot into the top corner of Joe Hart's net. It was a majestic goal but tarnished, to some degree, by the behaviour of Andriy Yarmolenko in the build-up. The midfielder had been lying on the ground, apparently injured, when Lescott's misplaced pass went his way. After that he was on his feet in a flash, the pretence over. Three passes later, Konoplyanka had the opportunity to demonstrate his shooting ability from long distance.</p> <p>England's sense of grievance was exacerbated by the fact that Yarmolenko was also implicated in the 10th minute, when Defoe darted between three Ukraine players and drilled a shot inside the near post. The finish was exemplary but the Turkish referee, Cuneyt Cakir, decided the striker had unfairly palmed off Yarmolenko in the process. In truth it was little more than the briefest of contacts but it led to an exaggerated fall, with Yarmolenko clutching his face with both hands. Again, a little bit of thespianism did the trick.</p> <p>By that point England were already looking too vulnerable in defence for Hodgson's liking and grateful that Oleh Gusev's cross had merely clipped a post, having flicked off Oxlade-Chamberlain and looped over Hart.</p> <p>Ukraine produced some confident, flowing football and continued to be dangerous on the break in the second half. At the other end Welbeck stabbed a shot against a post and Glen Johnson's forward runs from right-back provided some form of danger. The Liverpool defender was probably England's best player but he, too, will miss the next game on the back of bookings in successive matches.</p>",
  "<p>When it was originally unveiled, the iPhone was so universally revered that wags dubbed it the \"Jesus Phone\". Five years on, its power is so great that its latest iteration could perform the miraculous feat of saving the US economy.</p> <p>Apple's release of the iPhone 5 on Wednesday could materially impact US gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of the year, claimed JP Morgan's chief economist Michael Feroli in a note to clients. Boosting the bottom line of the world's most valuable company is one thing, but Feroli contends that iPhone sales could add between 0.25 and 0.5 of a percentage point to the US's sluggish economic growth rate.</p> <p>JP Morgan expects Apple to sell around 8m of the new devices in the fourth quarter and for the iPhone 5 to be priced at about $600. Subtracting about $200 in imported component costs would allow the government to factor in $400 per phone into its GDP calculations for the fourth quarter, according to Feroli's calculations.</p> <p>In his note, Feroli wrote: \"Calculated using the so-called 'retail control method', sales of iPhone 5 could boost annualized GDP growth by $3.2bn, or $12.8bn at an annual rate.\" Sales would help prop up the struggling US economy by limiting \"the downside risk to our Q4 GDP growth protection, which remains 2%\", he wrote.</p> <p>Feroli said the estimate of between a quarter to a half point of annualized GDP \"seems fairly large, and for that reason should be treated skeptically\". But, he added, \"we think the recent evidence is consistent with this projection\".</p> <p>The report met with some scepticism among Feroli's peers. \"God help us if we have to rely on the iPhone to underpin the US economy,\" said one analyst who wished to remain anonymous. Others questioned the math, pointing out that if people buy iPhones with money they had intended to spend elsewhere, there would be no GDP boost.</p> <p>Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG said the larger point was what the story said about the US economy. \"There's no doubt that Apple are going to sell millions of these things,\" he said. \"But it underscores how weak the economy is that we even care about the possible impact of a quarter percentage boost to the economy.\"</p> <p>Of course there is always the tiny possibility that Apple will not be releasing the iPhone 5 at all. The notoriously secretive company has given no details of tomorrow's much anticipated launch. If it isn't a new iPhone, heaven help us all.</p>",
  "<p>The United Kingdom is facing forces that are trying to tear it apart. The Scottish nationalists grab most of the attention, but Wales has its own nationalist party, Plaid Cymru, and earlier this year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/23/leanne-wood-wales-plaid-cymru\" title=\"\">Leanne Wood, a 40-year-old former probation officer, became its first female leader.</a> I interviewed her at the end of last week and these are the highlights.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Wood said Wales was not ready for independence because it was not self-sufficient economically. </strong>Although Plaid Cymru is committed to independence as a long-term goal, Wood said \"it could not happen tomorrow\" because the Welsh economy was too weak and that it would take \"a lot of work\" to get to the stage where an independent Wales would be financially viable. <a href=\"http://www.clickonwales.org/2012/07/wales-breaks-10000-spending-per-head-barrier/\" title=\"\">(One recent report said that because public spending per head is higher in Wales, and tax receipts per head are lower, Wales has a fiscal deficit of \u00a35,783 per head, compared with \u00a32,000 per head in England.)</a> Wood said Wales had to make up for the fact that its economy had been in decline compared with the rest of the UK for the last 20 years and that giving more economic powers to the Welsh assembly would put the country on the road to recovery.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 She accused Iain Duncan Smith of perpetuating \"negative stereotypes\" about the Welsh. </strong>Referring to his comment about people in Merthyr being unwilling to travel to Cardiff to find work, she said: \"When was the last time he went there and spoke to people from Merthyr?\" She also said that the Welsh in general were still sometimes subject to ridicule because of their nationality and she singled out MTV's show The Valleys as a particularly \"awful\" example of anti-Welsh stereotyping.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Wood said she could imagine Plaid Cymru being led at some point in the future by someone who did not speak Welsh. </strong>\"I rarely use the Welsh language myself in my day-to-day work, so in some senses you could argue that they already have [a non Welsh-speaking leader],\" said Wood, who is the first person not fluent in Welsh to lead the party.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 She said Wales would benefit if it could become a multilingual nation. </strong>\"We could do an awful lot in Wales if we were eventually a multilingual nation,\" she said. \"There are a number of studies now that suggest that if people have more than one language, their minds are open to learning a third and a fourth and even more languages.\"</p> <p>We met in Wood's office at the Welsh assembly in Cardiff Bay. For me, it's a good place to contemplate long-term change because I started my career on the South Wales Echo in the early 1990s when Cardiff Bay was mostly derelict wasteland next to mudflats. Now there's a barrage, an attractive waterfront, a world-class concert hall and, of course, a mini parliament. Scotland and Wales both voted for devolution 15 years ago this month but nationalism in the two countries is very different. In Cardiff it's slow, and gradualist. Wood is not anticipating, or even demanding, full independence any time soon. But she thinks it will happen eventually. Here's what she had to say. You can decide for yourself whether you think she's right.</p> <h2><strong>Nationalism</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: Why are you a nationalist?</strong></p> <p>A: I see Wales very much as a country which is not at the moment reaching its full potential. Wales has its own history, its own unique language and is a distinct geographic entitity; to me, it makes sense for it to be a political unit.</p> <h2><strong>Scottish nationalism and Welsh nationalism</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: Since devolution, Scottish nationalism has done very well, while Welsh nationalism hasn't done so well. What's your explanation for that?</strong></p> <p>A: If you are talking about the success of the national parties, you've got a point. But the Welsh nationalist agenda has progressed quite significantly since the setting up of devolution. What we've seen happening in Wales is that the British parties, the unionist parties, have taken on a lot of the policies that we've been advocating. We advocated the reform of the Barnett formula, measures to defend the Welsh language, for example, and the parties have come on board, on to our territory. There's no difference between the parties on those issues. And the same goes for extending devolution, in terms of the referendum that we won last year. All parties are united around progressing that agenda.</p> <p><strong>Q: But in terms of the party, what went wrong for Plaid over the last few years?</strong></p> <p>A: What's been successful in Scotland was extending a very good settlement that they had to start with. We started from a very different position in Wales; we're obviously a different country. We started with a different devolution settlement. So there was a job of work to do to establish the principle of devolution in Wales, which did not have to happen in Scotland. But if we look at where we are now, we are in a very different place from where we were when devolution was first set up. And certainly now, since the economic crash in 2008, people's problems are very different to the ones that they were back then and, in terms of Wales's economic position, the situation is getting worse. So now we have an opportunity within this current context.</p> <h2><strong>Plaid's leadership</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: One explanation for why nationalists have done better in Scotland might be that the SNP have got this mega-personality, Alex Salmond, and Plaid have not been able to put up a leader with that sort of charisma. Do you think that has been a factor?</strong></p> <p>A: I tend to think generally that things are mostly about politics and not personalities, to be honest with you, and what we've got to do here in Wales is get to the point where the SNP are in Scotland. And that means we've got to become the biggest party, we have got to be in a position to put these arguments, and then a referendum, to the people of Wales.</p> <h2><strong>Scottish independence referendum</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: If Scotland were to vote for independence, what impact would that have on electoral politics in Wales and Plaid's position?</strong></p> <p>A: That would have a big impact. It would send shockwaves, really, through the entire system because the United Kingdom as it currently exists would be no more. Then it would be a matter for Wales to decide what role we wanted to have in a newly shaped United Kingdom. And I've advocated a system which looks much more like a partnership of equals so that there is a strong voice for Wales within that. We share an island. There is going to be much common ground between the counties that currently make up the United Kingdom after that eventuality. On what basis will we be working together? That's the kind of conversation I would like people in Wales to have alongside the developments in Scotland.</p> <p><strong>Q: And if Scotland votes no, is that setback for your party and Welsh independence?</strong></p> <p>A: I don't think it has to be necessarily.</p> <p><strong>Q: Why not?</strong></p> <p>A: I would prefer a yes vote to happen in Scotland. But I think there's still a debate to be had about how we govern ourselves and how we look after our own affairs. There is public support in Wales, for example, for more independence in our health service. I would argue, with the economic problems that we've got, more independence is needed in terms of looking at our fiscal levers and what we can do in terms of making changes to the economy that we need to turn it into a successful economy, not a declining one.</p> <h2><strong>Independence</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: What model of independence are you looking at? Or, to put it another way, how independent would you like Wales to be?</strong></p> <p>A: As far as people in Wales want to go. I am of the view that everything comes back to the economy, that we can't really get to grips with the root problems of our economy unless we have more autonomy and ability to control the levers that affect these things. We have made representations to <a href=\"http://commissionondevolutioninwales.independent.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">the Silk Commission</a> that is looking at the new financial powers that will come to Wales as a result of the various changes that are happening in other parts of the UK and <a href=\"http://www.english.plaidcymru.org/news/2012/02/09/plaid-cymru-publishes-silk-commission-proposals-for-improving-nations-economic-performance/\" title=\"\">we have advocated more independence in terms of our fiscal levers</a> so that we can make those changes that we need to help.</p> <p><strong>Q: But it's sometimes been unclear, at least to me, whether Plaid are going for what they call in Scotland \"devo max\", or whether you want Wales to be a fully independent separate state, with a seat at the UN and passports and everything.</strong></p> <p>A: I've been clear that independence means full membership of the United Nations and everything that goes with that. But we are not in the same place as they are in Scotland and we are not as near to it as they are there. And the reason for that is that we have a declining economy. That has got to be the issue that is addressed first and foremost.</p> <p>I mentioned earlier on that since the economic crisis there is a new layer of problems facing people in Wales. There are a whole host of statistics that show that people in Wales are facing cuts that are worse [than elsewhere in the UK] because the public sector here is greater, and the number of people claiming benefits here is greater. And our unemployment rates are higher, which means that there is more demand on the public purse.</p> <p><strong>Q: Doesn't that then become a drag on the case for independence?</strong></p> <p>A: That's why we have to turn it round. We have to turn that situation around.</p> <p><strong>Q: But if you get independence before you've got a self-financing economy, you're in trouble, aren't you? Before you became leader, who wrote an article saying,</strong><a href=\"http://en.leannewood.com/?p=269\" title=\"\"><strong> \"Most of us who want independence for Wales accept the weak state of the Welsh economy means we would struggle to afford the current Welsh welfare bill.\"</strong></a><strong> So, if you go the independence model that you want, where would the money come from? In Scotland they've got oil.</strong></p> <p>A: This is why I've been clear that it could not happen tomorrow. We have to do a lot of work before we get to the point where we are in a position to do that. But ultimately we can go up to a point so far and then we will be constrained in how successful we will be able to become economically because we won't have the control over the levers that will be able to take us all the way there. All of our effort now has to go into job creation, so we get to a situation where we get more people contributing into the tax pot than there is money going out. That's the basis of any other country in the world. Any independent nation raises what it spends and it is not unreasonable to suggest that Wales could not be any different to any other country in the world, I would contend.</p> <p><strong>Q: So is that a prerequisite for independence? Does the Welsh economy have to get to that state before independence becomes sensible?</strong></p> <p>A: I would not say that's a prerequisite in any way, because ultimately what will decide when and how far we go will be the people of Wales.</p> <p><strong>Q: But the people of Wales are not going to vote for it if does not work economically.</strong></p> <p>A: At the moment there are low numbers of people who support the general idea of independence for Wales because of our economic situation. People understand the importance of prioritising the economy. We have to put that at the front of our agenda. And unless we can answer people's concerns about the Welsh economy then I don't think we are going to win the independence argument.</p> <p><strong>Q: You have said that independence is not something that you would want tomorrow because of these economic problems. So what kind of timescale are we talking about? Are you thinking of decades? It takes decades, or generations, to turn around an economy.</strong></p> <p>A: A report that was published by our newly set-up economy commission, <a href=\"http://www.english.plaidcymru.org/uploads/downloads/Offas_gap.pdf\" title=\"\">a report called Offa's Gap, </a>has shown that the Welsh economy has been in decline relative to the UK economy for the last 20 years. So we have got 20 years' worth of decline to turn around just to get back to where we were in around 1994, 1995.</p> <p><strong>Q: But even then, which was roughly the time I was writing for the Western Mail, Wales was a net dependent, not a net contributor to the UK exchequer. From what you are saying, you seem to suggest it could take 20 years or more to get the economy to a stage where independence becomes viable.</strong></p> <p>A: I would hope that as we gain powers and more control over the economic levers, we would be able to see success faster than we have seen decline. The effort, then, has to go into job creation. We favour new models of companies, for example, so that there would be a big push to support co-operatives and social enterprises. Those sort of companies that we'll set up will employ local people and not then up sticks and move to other parts of the world where labour is cheaper. We've got to think about ways of restructuring our economy so that jobs remain, wealth remains locked into local areas, in a way that has not happened before. So much of the wealth generated in Wales has left in the past. If we learn anything from history, we have to make sure that in the future, when we go back to making things again, that we lock that wealth into Wales and into the pockets of people in Wales.</p> <p><strong>Q: How certain are you that Welsh independence will happen? Are you 100%, bet-your-house-on-it certain that it will happen in your lifetime? Or is it more likely than not?</strong></p> <p>A: I think, to be honest, eventually it's inevitable. People will arrive at the conclusion that we can only really prosper if we do things for ourselves.</p> <p><strong>Q: And are you talking about full-blown independence?</strong></p> <p>A: It's the ability to control our economic destiny that's the key thing for me. People will realise that we can try to work within this system, we can devolve some aspects and make some changes, but ultimately we won't be able to make the leap that we need to make unless we fully control our own economic destiny.</p> <h2><strong>Tax policy </strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: In Scotland, Alex Salmond has suggested that one reason he would like control over taxes is that he can do an Ireland, lower corporation tax and bring investment into the country that way. Would a Plaid Wales be a country with lower rates than England or the rest of the UK?</strong></p> <p>A: We would look at taxation in the round. The debates that are going on within the Silk commission, some tax-raising powers look as though they will be coming to Wales. As I understand it, corporation tax is one of those that is more difficult. This economy commission that I have set up will be coming out with a raft of proposals in terms of taxation policy, so the specifics will have to wait, I'm afraid.</p> <h2><strong>Plaid and the pound</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: In an independent Wales, would Plaid keep the pound?</strong></p> <p>A: That's a matter for discussion in the runup to the debate on independence. I know that they have got to come down with a view on that in Scotland. We are not in the same place. We don't know where the euro is going, for example, and we don't know what is going to happen to all forms of currency in the future. So I would say let's not put things in tablets of stone in terms of what currency we'd be using.</p> <h2><strong>Defence policy</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: What about defence? Would an independent Wales have its own armed forces?</strong></p> <p>A: I would like to see a serious reduction in the amount of money we spend on defence in general. I would obviously like to see Wales's share of defence expenditure reduced and spent on useful things. I have said in the past that the amount of money spent subsidising the arms industry is unsustainable and unacceptable as well and that I think huge savings could be made to put into the public services.</p> <h2><strong>BBC</strong> </h2> <p><strong>Q: Would an independent Wales still have the BBC?</strong></p> <p>A: Again, these are matters for people to look at further down the line.</p> <h2><strong>Royal family</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: And the monarchy. What's the party's position? Would an independent Wales keep the monarchy?</strong></p> <p>A: Our policy is that, after independence, we would put the matter as a question in a referendum to people.</p> <h2><strong>Relations with England after independence</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: You have talked about the need, in a post-independence settlement, for a relationship with England and Scotland and </strong><a href=\"http://www.english.plaidcymru.org/the-slate/2012/06/29/another-union-is-possible/\" title=\"\"><strong>the idea of a \"neighbourhood of nations\".</strong></a><strong> What do you envisage? Are you just talking about meetings a couple of time a year? Or would the post-UK nations need to set up some kind of supra-national structure to coordinate on immigration and the environment and all the rest of it?</strong></p> <p>A: Yes. I think it would make sense for some kind of body to co-ordinate those big macro issues, and things around the sea, for example, as well. But it would have to be very much on a different basis from the current set up, where, within the Westminster parliament, the needs of England dominate. We would advocate that partnership being much more on the basis of equals.</p> <p>What happens in Scotland will determine where all of this goes. Whatever happens, there is going to be a referendum. Whether the outcome is yes or no, I would argue that there would need to be a conversation about what happens post that referendum.</p> <p><strong>Q: Alex Salmond </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jan/25/alex-salmond-hugo-young-lecture\" title=\"\"><strong>in his Hugo Young lecture this year</strong></a><strong> described himself as a \"staunch anglophile\". Are you an anglophile?</strong></p> <p>A: I would not say I'm not an anglophile, specifically. I'm a francophile, I like Spain, I like Scotland.</p> <p><strong>Q: But are you a francophile but not an anglophile?</strong></p> <p>A: I don't have to choose as far as I see it.</p> <p><strong>Q: No, but if you are happy to describe yourself as a francophile are you happy to describe yourself as an anglophile?</strong></p> <p>A: I would like to see myself as somebody who looks to nations all over the world. England would be one of those. But it would not be over and above any others particularly for me.</p> <h2><strong>National identity</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: Do you think it is sensible to talk about national identity? Is there such a thing as an English national identity and a Scottish national identity and a Welsh national identity?</strong></p> <p>A: I do think there is such a thing. My approach to politics is very much as a civil nationalist. So for me Wales is about who lives here now and what contribution they want to make to building up our communities and our civic body politics, if you like. In a world that is becoming more Coca-Cola or Pepsi or McDonald's or Big Mac, people are going to want to find ways that mark their identity out as a bit different, find aspects of culture that are unusual and quirky, because I think that everything being the same is a bit boring and bland.</p> <p><strong>Q: Ed Miliband gave </strong><a href=\"http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2012/06/07/ed-miliband-s-englishness-speech-in-full\" title=\"\"><strong>a speech earlier this year on Englishness</strong></a><strong> and he identified \"quiet determination in the face of adversity\" as a particular English trait, or the essence of Englishness. What's the essence of Welshness?</strong></p> <p>A: In terms of what's at the essence of Welsh politics, I would say that there is a public service ethos, that there is a want for politics to be done on a more co-operative basis and for the reduction of inequalities to be centred as part of our politics. The centre of gravity of Welsh politics is much nearer to those values than it is in the UK as a whole.</p> <h2><strong>Discrimination against the Welsh</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: In </strong><a href=\"http://en.leannewood.com/?page_id=123\" title=\"\"><strong>one of the articles you wrote during your leadership campaign</strong></a><strong> you talked about the Welsh still being victims of discrimination and how it was acceptable to ridicule the Welsh? Can you give me some examples of that?</strong></p> <p>A: Jeremy Clarkson. Anne Robinson. Various snipes and jibes about the Welsh language that happen on a fairly regular basis. Then, when people complain about them, they are told that they are being over-sensitive. Those kinds of things really. I don't want to particularly dwell on those aspects because we get accused of whingeing about irrelevant things. But I do get a sense sometimes that there are some nationalities in the world, some groups of people, where it is still acceptable to ridicule on the basis that they are of a particular nationality. And, thankfully, in many other areas of life that has become unacceptable. But there is still a hangover of some being left. I think we need to move on from that.</p> <p><strong>Q: How do you feel about the way the way the Welsh are portrayed on TV? There was a Valleys comedy, Stella, on recently. Or Gavin and Stacey? Do you have a problem with those?</strong></p> <p>A: No. There's a bit of humour there. We can all laugh and enjoy programmes like that. I would be more critical of <a href=\"http://www.mtv.co.uk/shows/the-valleys\" title=\"\">the latest MTV attempt to show the Valleys</a>.</p> <p><strong>Q: I haven't seen that.</strong></p> <p>A: Don't go there. It's awful. But they tried to pluck young people out of the sleepy hamlet of the Valleys and put them in the big bright lights of Cardiff.</p> <p><strong>Q: That's one of these reality programmes.</strong></p> <p>A: It's that sort of programme. There have been lots of sheep in the publicity shots, so I can guess where that's going.</p> <p>There have been a lot of negative stereotypes out there. A lot of them have been pushed by the Conservative party, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-11605318\" title=\"\">like Iain Duncan Smith when he went to Merthyr and said people don't want to travel from Merthyr to Cardiff</a>, really stereotyping. When was the last time he went there and spoke to people from Merthyr? There are plenty of people I know who would travel, and do travel, an awful long way to find work but there isn't work out there for them. But I don't particularly want to contribute to further accusations of us just whingeing and not being able to take a joke.</p> <h2><strong>Plaid and the Welsh language</strong></h2> <p>Q: I posted<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/06/ask-plaid-cymru-leanne-wood?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\"> a blog inviting people to suggest questions to ask you</a> and there were quite a few comments from people [like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18110465\" title=\"\">showmaster</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18111334\" title=\"\">Temulkar</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18114609\" title=\"\">yahyah</a>] saying they were put off Plaid by the sense that it was a party only for Welsh speakers. Do you accept that's a problem for the party?</p> <p>A: I would argue that nobody is excluded from Plaid Cymru and we seek to defend the rights of Welsh-language speakers in the same context as we seek to defend the rights of other minorities who experience discrimination. So for us it's an equalities issue and an issue about rights. But the idea that people would feel excluded from being part of Plaid Cymru would concern me, to be honest. It is never something that I've felt. I've learnt Welsh and I am still in the process of learning Welsh. I can't call myself fluent in it unfortunately yet. But certainly I have never felt any discrimination on the grounds of not being a fluent Welsh speaker.</p> <p><strong>Q: But this is what</strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18115528\" title=\"\"><strong> one woman</strong></a><strong> said: \"It put me off joining Plaid, which I seriously considered, when it was made clear that although they will try and accommodate English speakers, they prefer to communicate in Welsh at my local meetings.\" She also said: \"The feeling among a lot of people I've spoken to here is that Plaid have some good policies, but despite the nice words about inclusivity in the Plaid manifesto, on the ground there tends to be a narrow-minded, insular, corrupt anti-incomer mindset.\" Other people said similar things. Why is that perception out there?</strong></p> <p>A: In some communities there are tensions where people are perceived to have lots of money, they move in and buy up inflated-priced properties. It could be a reflection of some of those tensions within communities. But generally I would encourage people like that to contact me directly so I can have a private conversation about where these problems are arising because I am really keen to ensure that Plaid Cymru is a party open to everybody, whichever part of Wales they are in.</p> <p><strong>Q: Can you ever imagine Plaid being led by somebody who did not speak Welsh?</strong></p> <p>A: Well, yes I can. I rarely use the Welsh language myself in my day to day work, so in some senses you could argue that they already have. I'm trying to learn and one of the reasons is political. I would say for many people in Plaid Cymru who are not first language Welsh speakers, we want to learn. But, equally, there are plenty of people who are members who are not learning. And that is fine. I would say there's no pressure to learn the language.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18110141\" title=\"\"><strong>One person</strong></a><strong> raised education as an issue in the context of this. He or she said: \"I am a welsh speaker but you must realise that statements from you, that all children in Wales will be taught partly through the medium of Welsh, are disastrous and instantly destroy support in non-Welsh speaking Wales.\" What do you say to that?</strong></p> <p>A: I'm not convinced that this would put people off. I come at this from an education perspective, in that I think we could do an awful lot in Wales if we were eventually a multilingual nation. There are a number of studies now that suggest that if people have more than one language, their minds are open to learning a third and a fourth and even more languages. And that minds are open to other subjects as well. So, in terms of a new approach in schools to look at becoming multilingual eventually, then to start with the two that we've got here, and then introducing a third and maybe a fourth later on within the school curriculum, we should be able to create a multilingual population which would give us an economic advantage in the future.</p> <p><strong>Q: You've talked about language as a discrimination issue. Are there any circumstances where people who do not speak Welsh are facing discrimination in Wales because they apply for jobs where Welsh is a requirement?</strong></p> <p>A: I have not seen any evidence of that. The accusation is often mentioned, but I have not seen any evidence of people being barred from getting jobs. If you think of language as another skill, for some jobs you have to have a certain skill set to apply for those jobs. You would not apply for a job as a data entry clerk if you could not use computers.</p>",
  "<p>The people of Manchester Central have before them a unique opportunity to pass judgement not just on the state of their constituency, but on the state of Britain and our democracy as a whole. </p> <p>In electoral terms Manchester Central is perhaps most noticeable for having the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/constituency/1111/manchester-central\">lowest turnout</a> of any constituency at the last election, so whilst it appears a staunch Labour seat, this doesn't seem an attachment held with any great enthusiasm (unsurprising given the levels of deprivation that remain even after 13 years of Labour rule.) </p> <p>This voting history is undoubtedly also an indication of the wider malaise in British democracy and a result of the lack of any viable alternative. An alternative the <a href=\"http://www.pdpgb.org.uk\">People's Democratic Party</a> now seeks to offer.</p> <p>As candidate for the PDP I have to confess to not being a Mancunian and never having lived in this great northern city. No doubt I will be attacked as a carpet-bagger, but despite this I'm pretty sure what the major concerns of local electors are, and they aren't copyright law reform, unilateral nuclear disarmament or defending the Iranian Revolution. Indeed, there are few things more tragic than middle-class, left-liberal, 'intellectuals' attempting to speak for the northern working classes.</p> <p>What concerns the people of Manchester, and ordinary people across the north of England, are unemployment, crime, lack of opportunity, housing, drugs, family breakdown and, yes, mass immigration. </p> <p>On immigration in particular, they want to be able to raise genuine and legitimate concerns about the effect of this on jobs, wages and their local communities without immediately being denounced by Labour and the liberal-left as 'bigoted'.</p> <p>The PDP shares such concerns, and understands they are concerns based on resources, not race.</p> <p>We believe the people of the north are crying out for an alternative to the tired, failed, and patronising politics of a Labour Party now staffed by career politicians with little understanding of the real world.

  "<p>Britain's rental market is \"overheating\" with a third of tenants in the south-east and London paying more than 50% of their take-home pay to landlords, according to property website <a href=\"http://www.rightmove.co.uk/\" title=\"Rightmove website\">Rightmove</a>.</p> <p>Average rents continue to spiral upwards, with the monthly cost of a typical flat in the capital jumping 2.3% in August alone, and 5.8% over a year, to a record \u00a31,272, according to <a href=\"https://homelet.co.uk/\" title=\"HomeLet website\">separate figures from HomeLet</a>, a tenant referencing service.</p> <p>Fears are growing for a new generation of \"trapped renters\", squeezed by flat incomes and rising rents which make it virtually impossible to save for a deposit on a new home.</p> <p>\"These 'trapped renters' are faced with the prospect of a downward spiral where spending more income on rent also means saving less for a deposit,\" said Miles Shipside, director of Rightmove, which estimates that 31% of tenants in the south-east and 29% in London are already spending more than half their take-home pay on rent.</p> <p>Last week the government promised \u00a3300m in funding for 15,000 homes for first-time buyers, but at the same time <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/06/cameron-clegg-unveil-planning-reforms\" title=\"Cameron and Clegg unveil planning reforms\">relaxed rules on builders</a> who complain sites are not profitable if they are forced to build affordable homes.</p> <p>But the lack of finance for young borrowers, particularly those unable to save for a large deposit, plus the generally high level of house prices, remains the nub of the issue. The <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/\" title=\"FSA website\">Financial Services Authority</a> said yesterday that new lending for house purchases continued to stagnate at about \u00a340bn in the second quarter of 2012 \u2013 the same level as last year.</p> <p>Only a tiny proportion of lending is going to those with small deposits or who need a large multiple of their salary to afford a home. The FSA said just 2% of mortgages were granted to buyers with a deposit of 10% or less. It added: \"New lending with a combination of high LTV [loan to value] and high income multiple was unchanged from the previous quarter, slightly in excess of 1% of new lending.\"</p> <p>The FSA also noted that the average interest rate on a new mortgage, including both house movers as well as first-time buyers, rose from 3.5% to 3.78% in the second quarter of 2012 despite the Bank of England base rate remaining at 0.5%.</p> <p>Last month, the government's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/aug/01/funding-for-lending-scheme-scepticism\" title=\"Funding for Lending scheme launches amid scepticism\">Funding for Lending scheme began</a>, aimed at driving down the cost of loans for businesses and homebuyers, but so far there is little evidence of falling rates.</p> <p>Housing analysts reckon tenants in many parts of the country are hitting the limits on how much more they can afford to pay. HomeLet, which examines tenant's incomes to check they can afford to pay, found average earnings were down 0.1% on a year ago. \"Tenants are being stretched more than ever, and it will be interesting to see how long they'll be able to afford these continually rising living costs,\" said Ian Fraser, managing director of HomeLet.</p> <p>Meanwhile, landlords are enjoying bumper incomes as tenants struggle. Rightmove estimated the \"yield\" on investment properties is now running at an average of 6% across the UK, or more than double the amount investors can typically earn on a savings account.</p> <p>But the national average rental figures mask huge regional variations. HomeLet said the average rental home outside the capital costs about \u00a3684 a month, an increase of 1.9% on the year.</p> <p>Rents are lowest in the north-east where they average \u00a3524 a month and have been falling for three years, HomeLet said.</p>",
  "<p>My father, David Jones, who has died aged 80, was a profoundly cultured man who dedicated much of his life to bringing up his children, Gavin, Rosamund and me.</p> <p>He was born in Sheffield, the only child of Rees Jones, a teacher, and his wife, Olive. At High Storrs grammar school, Dad achieved the best A-level results in South Yorkshire and won a place to read English at University College, Oxford. He got a first and was invited to sit the prestigious exam for All Souls College, but decided instead to spend two years lecturing at the University of Salamanca in Spain.</p> <p>He met and married Yvonne Taylor in 1960. He became a civil servant, and worked in the Department for Education when Margaret Thatcher was secretary of state. A lifelong Labour party member, he did not have a good word to say about Thatcher.</p> <p>My mother suffered from severe depression. They divorced. She killed herself in 1978 when I was six, and Rosamund and Gavin were teenagers; and we went to live with my father in London. It was at this difficult time, when he was 47, that he decided to sit law exams and became a litigation solicitor, in order, he said, to provide us with stability and security.</p> <p>Although Dad had not planned for his life to work out this way, he relegated his personal and professional ambitions to looking after his family. At weekends, Dad and I visited museums, the Jurassic coast to look for fossils, foraged for mushrooms or visited long barrows.

One of his hobbies was writing and he hurriedly published a collection of short stories inspired by life in the London suburbs, called Suburban Voices (2001). He also decided to tell Gavin that he was not his biological father. When he married my mother, he knew she was pregnant by someone else. He never knew who Gavin's father was and nor did he care.</p> <p>Had life been different, had he not been a single parent and later diagnosed with Parkinson's, he might have written more books. But he was proud, I hope, of what he achieved. His children knew him well and loved him. He is survived by Gavin, Rosamund and me, and by Millie.</p>"
