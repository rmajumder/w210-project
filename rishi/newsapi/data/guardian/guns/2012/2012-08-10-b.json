  "<p>I can remember watching the Olympics as a 10-year-old and being so inspired by the spectacle that I restaged the events in my backyard, excitedly competing (against myself) to set a series of make-believe world records. When it was announced in 2005 that London had won its bid to stage the 30th Olympiad, I was pleased: now the Olympics really would be coming to my backyard. But I didn't expect to feel excited. And as the opening ceremony grew closer, and the stories of mismanagement multiplied, I feared the worst.</p> <p>I was wrong. Most of us were wrong. The last two weeks have been amazing.</p> <p>I'm embarrassed to admit how many times my eyes have welled up. And even more embarrassed that the cause has usually been a British medal.</p> <p>\"Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel,\" Samuel Johnson said. I've not often felt proud of being British. But pride of some sort seems to have affected most of the country.</p> <p>There are different kinds of pride contained within it: civic or county pride (Yorkshire has had a great Games), ethnic pride (in seeing black British or mixed race athletes win gold), family pride (as felt by parents, partners and children). But they all come under the one flag.</p> <p>What's wonderful about the crowds waving their union flags inside Olympic venues or sitting in front of giant screens across the country is how diverse they are, yet how united.</p> <p>The Games have been the most inclusive event in Britain in my lifetime. They've reclaimed the flag from the bigots and sectarians who use it to divide us one from the other. They'd done so by highlighting qualities we can all celebrate \u2013 not the worthless tat of celebrity culture, but physical prowess, mental agility, tactical skill, speed, endurance, dedication and hard work.</p> <p>Pride is a dangerous thing, a precursor to arrogance and hubris. We should not start deluding ourselves that we're the third most powerful nation on Earth just because we're sitting third in the medals table. Luckily, most Brits have a saving sense of irony. The Games are only games. Those pink and purple outfits the Olympic volunteers wear set the tone. So did the humour in Danny Boyle's opening ceremony.</p> <p>There's been something ever so slightly camp about these Olympics, a joke we can share, something to enjoy together but not to be taken too seriously. Runners in yellow shoes? That chap on the motorbike leading out the cyclists in the keirin? Britain winning medals? Pull the other one.</p> <p>Humour wasn't much in evidence in the build-up to the Games. Columnists solemnly declared it our moment of truth, the 17 days that would tell the world, and ourselves, what Britain stood for. The completion of the Olympic Park venues ahead of schedule might have been taken as a good sign; the procession of the Olympic torch as a measure of the public's enthusiasm for the Games; Bradley Wiggins's victory in the Tour de France just a week before as a mark of how well our athletes might perform. But the mood was sceptical. Slightly panicked, too, as if a sporting festival begun 2,000-odd years ago in Athens might lead to Armageddon.</p> <p>Would London be able to cope with the influx of visitors? What impression of Britain would our guests have if they suffered long queues at passport control, overcrowded trains and traffic gridlock caused by VIP lanes? Boris Johnson's voice could be heard at tube stations, warning of disruption. And motorway signs urged those travelling to Olympic events to allow plenty time and plan their journeys carefully.</p> <p>But who were these people? It seemed very few people in Britain had succeeded in getting tickets, no matter how many hours they'd spent on the <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/\" title=\"\">Locog website</a>. Resentment mounted.</p> <p>I felt it myself, not just for failing to get tickets, but because of what was happening where I live in south London, where most of Greenwich Park was closed for three months in order to stage the equestrian events and where ground-to-air missiles were installed on Blackheath. The missiles were allegedly there to combat any terrorist attack, but their mere presence was scary.</p> <p>At the 1972 Munich Olympics, 11 Israeli athletes and coaches had been shot dead. Would security be any tighter 40 years on? When G4S admitted that it could not provide the 10,000 security staff it had been paid millions of pounds to recruit, the omens looked grim. The spiralling cost of the Games, the bullying demands of corporate sponsors, the ineptitude when a bus bringing a visiting team from Heathrow to Stratford got lost because the driver couldn't operate his satnav \u2013 Sebastian Coe's great dream was threatening to become a nightmare. And it wouldn't stop raining.</p> <p>The opening ceremony lifted spirits. Even if you missed the history lesson underpinning it, about our transformation from smock-clad-peasants-round-a-maypole feudalism, through smoking-chimneys industrial revolution, to digital togetherness, the spectacle was terrific. Children trampolining on NHS beds while the Queen parachuted into the Olympic stadium with James Bond \u2013 it was eccentric, bonkers even, but very GB.</p> <p>Our early hosting when competition began wasn't encouraging, however. The North Korean women's football team walked off the pitch when the South Korean flag was displayed instead of their own. Worse was the sight of rows of empty seats. Was it foreign sports federations that were failing to use them? Or corporate sponsors? Whichever, it was a disgrace.</p> <p>Miserabilism was growing, and things weren't much brighter for Team GB. After Mark Cavendish failed to deliver on the first day, Lizzie Armitstead in the cycling road race and Rebecca Adlington in the 400m freestyle gave us a modicum of respectability, with a silver and a bronze. But next day it got worse again, when Tom Daley and partner screwed up their fourth dive.</p> <p>Our swimmers took their failures in good heart; one recommended swimming as a way of staying fit. This wasn't the ruthlessness billions of lottery money had been spent on. Even Ben Ainslie, one of our gold certs, was struggling. By the end of the fourth day, Team GB was a lowly 20th in the medals table. Though our athletes praised the crowd for their tremendous support, the pressure seemed to be getting to them. Home disadvantage.</p> <p>Day five brought a gold at last, for our women double scullers. And the sun came out for Bradley Wiggins. Team GB climbed to 11th in the medals table. Next day was even better. Three golds \u2013 Chris Hoy and team in the cycling, Peter Wilson in the double trap (clay pigeon shooting), and a gold and silver in the men's canoe slalom. By the end of the day we were up to fifth in the table.</p> <p>Still, no one could have predicted what happened last Saturday, 4 August 2012, a day to match or even eclipse 30 July 1966 in British sporting history: six gold medals in one day, and three athletics golds (Jessica Ennis, Mo Farah, Greg Rutherford) in a single evening session.</p> <p>The roar in the Olympic stadium was extraordinary. Over at Wimbledon, as Andy Murray reached the tennis final, a new chant went up: Gee-Bee clap-clap-clap, Gee-Bee clap-clap-clap. When the men's football team went out the way our national teams always do \u2013 in a penalty shoot-out in the quarter finals \u2013 it seemed inconsequential, comical even, not a cause for grief. There was too much else to delight in.</p> <p>The delight isn't just a matter of winning medals, but it helps. And British success has continued through the second week: the fabulous Brownlee brothers, Chris Hoy, Laura Trott, Jason Kenny, Nicola Adams, Jade Jones and many more. Bums on seats were always a good bet for British medals; our boats, bikes and horse riders tend to do well. But gymnastics? Boxing? Taekwondo? The triathlon? Our national self-image has been severely challenged. We thought we were losers. And we're not.</p> <p>Some of the failures were equally enthralling. So, too, was seeing the joy of less privileged nations as their athletes won gold, or hearing stories of competitors overcoming adversity (injury, bankruptcy, bereavement) during their preparations. Accusations of cheating have been few. And if Team GB has benefited in those sports where judges give marks (equestrianism, boxing, gymnastics), that's par for the course with host nations.</p> <p>There have been few drug scandals, so far. One US coach insinuated that 16-year-old Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen's world record was \"disturbing\". But when 15-year-old Katie Ledecky won the 800m freestyle for the US, he kept his mouth shut. Another swimming gold was won by 15-year-old Lithuanian Ruta Meilutyte, trained in Plymouth. Teenage success has been a big story at these games. At 23, Rebecca Adlington says she's now too old.</p> <p>Have the Games been an escape from reality? Not for athletes and their coaches but for the rest of us, yes, of course. The economy's still a mess, Syria is at war with itself, and David Cameron is prime minister. But for 17 days we could forget all that. The broadsheets and tabloids became one long sports section. Even the news on Radio 3 one day began with a couple of sports stories. If we'd landed on Mars no one would have noticed. We did land on Mars? I must have missed it.</p> <p>Those of us without tickets had to rely on television and Radio 5. This was the first digital Olympics, and the red button gave us unprecedented freedom: the right to roam, if only the length of the sofa. With due allowance for jingoism, the BBC coverage was generally excellent, and atoned for its performance at the Queen's diamond jubilee.</p> <p>Inevitably some of the commentary was vacuous (\"He gave that everything\" \u2013 it's the Olympics, stupid, why wouldn't he?) and I swear I heard Tim Henman say that Andy Murray beat Roger Federer by forcing him into unforced errors. But few athletes were described as having medalled, and none of having podiumed. The women commentators and analysts (Hazel Irvine, Denise Lewis and, above all, Clare Balding) came out top, overshadowing John Inverdale and that bland punster Gary Lineker.</p> <p>And the athletes were so well behaved. Win or lose, they'd walk straight from competing to give interviews. Goldie Sayers, the British javelin thrower, broke down with an injury during her event, then broke down in tears in front of the camera. Victoria Pendleton was tearful too. Some of the losers spoke of the four-year \"journey\" they'd been on and apologised for letting us down.</p> <p>They needn't have. The vast majority of Olympic competitors are bound to leave empty-handed. For many of those athletes who broke into smiles as they entered the stadium during the opening ceremony, that was as good as it got. By next lunchtime, some of them had already been eliminated.</p> <p>Much of the talk about legacy and the next generation is hollow. It is hard to see how young people in my area, for instance, will have been inspired by the dressage event at Greenwich. And I'm not sure I want them to be inspired by the shooting competitions that took place in Woolwich. But plenty of other Team GB successes are inspiring.</p> <p>And we've also learned about sports we don't excel at, such as handball, which ought be introduced at every school in the country (all you need is a ball and a set of goalposts). We're as sports mad as the Aussies just now and we should build on that. Academic achievements won't suffer if PE is given more time on the curriculum. They might even flourish. Mens sana in corpore sano.</p> <p>Come Monday, many of us are going to feel very flat. But there are images that will live on: the amazement on sculler Katherine Copeland's face (reminiscent of Kelly Holmes in Athens) when she realised she'd just won gold and mouthed to her partner Sophie Hosking \"We're going to be on a stamp\"; the Russian high jumper Ivan Ukhov failing to find the competitor's vest he'd removed after a previous jump and clearing the bar in a floppy T-shirt instead; the women heptathletes linking hands as they paraded round the stadium with Jessica Ennis; Usain Bolt's sprint double and David Rudisha's 800m world record; Bradley's sideburns, Jessica's smile. Most of us alive today won't experience another Olympics in this country. Like all good things \u2013 like parties, like the 100m, like life itself \u2013 the Games will soon be over, and far too quick. But the Paralympics are still to come. And I have tickets for those.</p>",
  "<p>When Pixar's new&#xa0;animated adventure Brave reaches UK cinemas next week, even grumps like me, who feel the picture <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/09/brave-review\" title=\"\">falls short of the studio's usual standard</a>, will be cheering in the streets. The cause for celebration is the&#xa0;film's emphasis on the relationship between a young, assertive Scottish princess called Merida and her mother. The idea has long prevailed that a film's potential audience falls in inverse proportion to the main character's oestrogen levels, but this has been discredited by Brave, which has already grossed more than $340m. This year we have also seen the film adaptation of Suzanne Collins's novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/22/the-hunger-games-review\" title=\"\">The Hunger Games</a> ($683m worldwide), and two popular spins on Snow White (Mirror, Mirror and Snow White and the Huntsman). And there must be at least another few hundred <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/twilight\" title=\"\">Twilight</a> books lined up on the Hollywood conveyor belt. No longer are&#xa0;complex female characters for the under-18s rarer than hen's teeth.</p> <p>If I'm attuned acutely to the presence of women in children's entertainment, that's partly a result of having two daughters. Still, I took a dismayingly long time to recognise their need to see themselves represented in the films they watch. At a screening of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones in 2002, my son Barney, who was eight, was spellbound, but my eldest daughter, Rosie, then nine&#xa0;years old, kept trudging off to the&#xa0;toilets. Was it an eating disorder? Dysentery? No \u2013 she was bored by this boys' own adventure set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far inferior to ours in its equality legislation. At 19, Rosie now has&#xa0;a special predilection for movie drag queens. Given time, and the necessary research grant, I'm certain I could prove this to be the result of a dearth of female role models in her early cinematic diet.</p> <p>By the time my youngest daughter, Edith, now 11, had developed a taste for film, I was better placed to understand what she might respond to. Japan's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jul/14/studio-ghibli-arrietty-heroines\" title=\"\">Studio Ghibli</a> was \u2013 and still is \u2013 a world leader in producing fantasies that happen not to exclude half the population. Movies such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/96263/spirited.away\" title=\"\">Spirited Away</a> or Kiki's Delivery Service encourage children to be uninhibited in their imaginations, emotions and ambitions.</p> <p>Young girls, in particular, benefit from seeing characters whose gender plays no part in their success or failure. Visibility, rather than idealism, is the key: anyone who grows up starved of stimulating on-screen counterparts is bound to feel&#xa0;overlooked at best, and undervalued at worst.</p> <p>Conventional wisdom has it that a&#xa0;story with predominantly male characters (from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/harrypotter\" title=\"\">Harry Potter</a> to Diary of&#xa0;a Wimpy Kid) will appeal to everyone, whereas a female equivalent will be as off-putting to most young boys as a game of kiss-chase. That's why Disney panicked over its film Rapunzel, switching the title to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/27/tangled-review\" title=\"\">Tangled</a> late in the&#xa0;day and retooling it to include more boy-friendly elements. It's why the hero of the same studio's Chicken Little was changed from female to male at great expense during production. Even a hit like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/nov/25/matilda-review\" title=\"\">the West End musical Matilda</a> will at some point have caused its marketing people to gnash their teeth and ask: \"But will the boys come to see it?\"</p> <p>In a fair world, Brave, The Hunger Games and Twilight will allay those fears, rather than be seen as freak hits. And it certainly wouldn't hurt for Hollywood to bulk up its behind-the-scenes female presence. Those whoops of joy over Brave catch in the throat at&#xa0;the news that its director, Brenda Chapman, was given her marching orders during production. \"Off-message\" would be a polite term for dismissing one of the few female directors working today from a movie about female empowerment \u2013 and replacing her with&#xa0;a&#xa0;man.</p> <p>The signs are that children's films are&#xa0;coming round to the idea of strong female heroes, even if Studio Ghibli still remains a wondrous anomaly. \"I think the old rules have been overturned,\" says Cressida Cowell, author of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/135028/how-to-train-your-dragon-3d\" title=\"\">How to Train Your Dragon</a> series. \"Girls need to be reminded not to kowtow to the boys too much. But there have been so many good female characters for girls in cinema \u2013 Lyra in The Golden Compass, Katniss in The Hunger Games, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/11726703\" title=\"\">Hit-Girl in Kick-Ass</a>. It's not that girls need to see other girls on screen in order&#xa0;to enjoy something. But you feel a&#xa0;bit cross when a cool female character isn't represented. As a young reader, I&#xa0;did wonder why there couldn't be&#xa0;a&#xa0;Jane Bond.\"</p> <p>One of Cowell's own daughters reprimanded her for not including any female characters in the first two Dragon novels. \"Although Maisie liked the books, she got really cross about that. So&#xa0;I created <a href=\"http://howtotrainyourdragon.wikia.com/wiki/Camicazi\" title=\"\">Camicazi</a>, the coolest girl imaginable. Now I get lots of boys saying she's their favourite character. They're not put off by the fact she's a girl.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/search.do\" title=\"\">Joanna Nadin</a>, author of the pre-teen Penny Dreadful books and the Rachel Riley young adult series, thinks the problem is perpetuated in the&#xa0;marketing departments. \"Publishers don't bother trying to sell girl books like mine to boys&#xa0;and instead 'pink them up' as far as&#xa0;possible,\" she says. \"I&#xa0;hate it. I&#xa0;read one of my books to a group of 13-year-old boys&#xa0;without showing them the cover and they loved it. Then, when they saw how&#xa0;it was marketed, they admitted they'd never buy it.\"</p> <p>Of course, the sparkly pink world of Disney princesses is an important part of the imaginative universe, and always will be, but what's changing now in movies is choice. A wider range of alternatives can only make young audiences more discerning and demanding. I hope my children feel unencumbered by any of the assumptions and biases left over from more prohibitive generations. And I was definitely heartened when Annie (the film of which opened exactly 30 years ago this month) was chosen as the end-of-term play at Edith's school. What thrilled me was not the prospect of 60 11-year-olds lunging for the tricky high notes in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yop62wQH498&amp;feature=fvwrel\" title=\"\">Tomorrow</a> so much as the thought of the opportunities it would present for girls neglected by the previous year's production of Oliver!</p> <p>As it happens, Edith auditioned for, and won, the part of Rooster, Annie's dastardly kidnapper \u2013 her traditionally male&#xa0;kidnapper. Is there a&#xa0;point there, other than that both my daughters have now exhibited an avowed interest in cross-dressing? Only, I suppose, that expressing yourself is partly about feeling you can do so without being restricted by gender \u2013 even if&#xa0;that means dressing up&#xa0;in a trilby, a spiv's suit and a badly glued-on moustache. Attagirl.</p> <p><em>Brave opens on Monday.</em></p> <h2><strong>Five more kick-ass female heroes</strong></h2> <p><strong>Hit-Girl (from Kick-Ass)</strong></p> <p>She's an 11-year-old superhero crime-fighter with a Girl Scout demeanour.

His potential downfall arrives in the shape of Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau AKA Jaime Lannister from Game Of Thrones).

  "<p>Katy Elder made front page news before she was two days old. On 14 March 1987, she was found zipped inside a canvas bag at a shop in Edler Way, Chesterfield. A quarter of a century later, where she came from remains a mystery. So late one evening three weeks ago, she took to YouTube to make a short film entitled <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbFx9Mle_G4\" title=\"Who is Katy Elder?\">Who is Katy Elder?</a> as an appeal to find information about her.</p> <p>The phone has hardly stopped ringing. In fact, she has since been reunited with the security guard and shop assistant who originally found her (who later got together and married) and she has even heard from the first policeman to arrive on the scene.</p> <p>It's a long shot from finding her birth family, she says, but it's a pretty good start. \"This has nothing to do with wanting a new family. I was adopted at nine months into a brilliant family and I wouldn't want to change them for the world. It's just that I have so many questions I can't lay to rest \u2013 the answers to which not only would most people take for granted but many adopted people have the chance to find out. What is my nationality? Who was my mother? Do I have any siblings? Are there any health issues I should know about?\" explains Victoria Vardy, her name since she was adopted.</p> <p>\"It feels a bit drastic going on YouTube, but what else can I do?\" she says. \"I am at an age where I could potentially have children of my own and, certainly, many of my friends have children. I suppose it has made me think more than ever about how you can't carry someone for nine months and just forget about it and walk away,\" she says, softly. \"I want to tell my mum that it's OK, that I understand and that I'm happy and safe.\"</p> <p>About 16 babies are abandoned every year in the UK. Many mothers are never traced, leaving their children, like Victoria, with no name, no parents and no knowledge of their background.</p> <p>Despite the trauma that shaped the very start of her life, Victoria, who is now 25 and lives in Manchester, is calm, confident and self-assured, as well as being upbeat and cheerful \u2013 all characteristics that she attributes to her loving upbringing. If you were looking for signs of insecurity, you might point to the puppy she cuddles at all times (and throughout her YouTube video), and her soft \u2013 at times childlike \u2013 tone. But above all, an affable combination of warmth, assertiveness, emotional maturity and optimism shine through.</p> <p>\"I can't remember a time when I didn't know about the circumstances of my birth,\" she says. \"My mum had this book called Jane is Adopted and it was a very positive story about being wanted and special, and that's how I felt with my mum and dad.\"</p> <p>That said, the fantasies that so often accompany adoption kicked in harder than ever. \"Because we knew nothing about my roots, I could convince myself of anything. For instance, I thought that at any second, I might discover I was secret royalty from some strange country between France and Germany. I even wondered if there was some big reason I didn't know the truth about my past \u2013 for example to protect me from being a super-hero,\" she says, laughing.</p> <p>She started asking questions when she was eight or so, such as where she was found (on the steps inside a Co-op), why she was called Katy (the shop assistant named her) and how old she was (less than 24 hours). Her parents \u2013 her father a plumber, her mother a receptionist \u2013- were always open about telling her what little they knew, but then her mother died suddenly, a few days after her 10th birthday. \"It was a huge loss, so it wasn't until I was about 16 and I left school that I gave it more attention again.\"</p> <p>In particular, Victoria remembers hearing about one or two people her age getting pregnant. \"It occurred to me that, technically, I \u2013 or my friends \u2013 could be in the same position as my birth mother and it gave me a new level of sympathy for her. Don't get me wrong \u2013 I've never been angry at her because I was always told she must have wanted the best for me by leaving me safe, dressed nicely and somewhere I'd be found so quickly, and I believed that. I still do.</p> <p>\"But now I thought about what it might be like to be her. I also started thinking about the situation in a more mature way, recognising that nobody would give up a baby under a day old willingly, even in the worst circumstances. At least, I can't imagine that they would.\"</p> <p>Victoria studied media and journalism, at college and then university, and had to learn research skills as part of the course. She decided to research herself. \"I found the name of the security guard who found me and I tried to find him. But I couldn't and I became despondent again.\"</p> <p>It's not that she became any less interested in knowing about her roots. \"Far from it \u2013 I became increasingly inquisitive, wondering why I have a creative side that my adoptive parents don't. I mean, I'm no Adele \u2013 but I can sing. I'm also quite artistic. But I just didn't know how to find out more.\"</p> <p>Victoria also suspected that her origins weren't 100% British. \"I have dark eyes and hair, and I had such an olive complexion when I was younger. I could be someone's holiday romance or perhaps I'm part of a travelling family.\"</p> <p>The travelling link is one that Victoria keeps returning to. \"Part of it is that the clothes I was found in were worn. Yes, they could have been from a charity shop, but it makes me wonder if my family were from a household or community with other children around and there were hand-me-downs. When you couple this with my colouring, the travelling community is surely a possibility.</p> <p>\"Also, I had a birth defect \u2013 a bone missing from my lower leg and I didn't have a fully formed foot \u2013 and a traveller friend told me it may have been seen as a curse within some travelling circles. This may have no truth in this at all, but these are the kinds of leads I'm dealing with.\"</p> <p>Victoria wonders if her diagnosis with type one diabetes may be a link to her deformity. \"It's a genetic condition and if you're not aware of it in pregnancy, it can cause deformities in the child. Either way, the diabetes may be helpful in my search because it's likely my birth mother has it.\"</p> <p>Two further clues include the return local bus ticket that Victoria was found with and the paperclip on her umbilical cord. \"The ticket could be a red herring, particularly as it was dated two months prior to me being found. On the other hand, it may suggest that my mother didn't come from far away. But I definitely think the fact that my umbilical cord was tied up with a paperclip is telling,\" she says, instantly animated. \"It must mean that someone at the birth scene knew what they were doing.</p> <p>\"I mean, a frightened girl would have been unlikely to know how to cut the umbilical cord, let alone know to clamp it. For all I know, I was taken from my mother's arms by older relative.\"</p> <p>Since making her YouTube video, Victoria's story has been picked up by the same local media that ran the original story of her being found. \"They recently reunited me with the security guard and his now wife on camera,\" says Victoria, slightly embarrassed. \"He was the one to open the bag and she helped me until the ambulance came, and they were clearly emotional about meeting me. For me, it wasn't emotional but it was very exciting and it gave me a chance to say thank you.</p> <p>\"I've also heard from the policeman who was first on the scene when I was found and I've had masses of contact from people offering support and good wishes, which has been lovely.\"</p> <p>The most significant was a fellow foundling. \"He has a very similar story to mine, having been left in Wolverhampton two years after me. It's been so good to share my story with someone that genuinely understands what it's like to have no history, but I think we can also help each other in our search and we're going to meet up in person soon. For example, he's pointed out that it's illegal to abandon your baby. I didn't know it was a crime and perhaps it still puts my birth mother off coming forward.\"</p> <p>However, Victoria's search is about more than her birth mother. \"I'd be just as happy to find my father or a sibling. Even someone who knew any of them would be wonderful.\"</p> <p>Victoria is under no illusion about her chances of success. \"It might seem crazy but I've no idea how else to go about it,\" she admits, half way through her <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbFx9Mle_G4\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a> video, which has had almost 2,000 hits so far.</p> <p>Her appeal is moving because of its spontaneity and simplicity. Meanwhile, the amateur nature of the film, complete with sticking camera frames, has a sincerity and tenderness than no slick, practised performance could achieve. \"A lot of people tell me I'm setting myself up for disappointment,\" she says. \"And as much as I'm hopeful, which is in my nature, I know I must also be prepared to find nothing.\"</p> <p>That said, Victoria won't be giving up easily. Her next plan is to contact the foster parents who looked after her for her first nine months of life, to find out more from the police, to get her original social services file, to join the National Contact Register and to keep up the momentum in her publicity campaign.</p> <p>\"It's all a bit surreal, as I'm not someone who is very comfortable with attention. But if it means I'll be able, when I look in the mirror, to know who I really am, it will be worth it.\"</p> <p><em>If you have any information about Katy Elder, please contact whoiskatyelder@gmail.com or visit the facebook page </em><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/WhoIsKatyElder?ref=stream\" title=\"WhoIsKatyElder\"><em>WhoIsKatyElder</em></a><em>. </em></p>",
  "<p><strong>My brother got married a couple of years ago to a lovely lady and they now have a baby. When my brother and his wife got engaged, my parents, along with my now husband and I, spent a lot of time with my sister-in-law's family, which I accepted as normal with all the pre-wedding planning. Unfortunately, my sister-in-law's father is something of a boor and has managed to upset me hugely in the past with insensitive comments.&#xa0; </strong></p> <p><strong>I have held my tongue so as to not upset the family peace, but it is becoming increasingly difficult. I have tried to discuss the situation with my parents, but have been told to ignore the comments as \"he is family\". No one seems to recognise that he is not, and never will be my family.</strong></p> <p><strong>I assumed that once my brother and sister-in-law were married, we would see less of her parents \u2013 but the time we have spent together has increased. They are always inviting my parents for various family events. Birthdays, religious celebrations and Mother's and Father's Day now no longer take place without them.&#xa0; </strong></p> <p><strong>When I got married a few months ago, we had a very small celebration. My parents insisted my brother's in-laws came too. I eventually conceded, as my parents were paying for the day, but I feel as though my wishes, even on my wedding day, came second to those who are not related to me.</strong></p> <p><strong>I am never invited to events by them directly, rather I am told by my mother that I have been invited. This leaves me feeling ever more marginalised. My husband's family are not in this country, and increasingly I feel as though we don't belong anywhere \u2013 and that my family are being taken away from me. Since my niece was born, it seems impossible to have any family time at all that doesn't include these people.</strong></p> <p><strong>How can I explain to my parents that I feel pushed out and rejected by this new family they are seemingly creating without me? I have tried a few times, but been told that, especially since my niece's arrival, we're all family now and I should just get on with it. I am trying, but feel very sad that I am unable to enjoy any family get-togethers any more. <em>K, via email</em></strong></p> <p>While I feel for you \u2013 I'm fiercely protective of my family \u2013 I think you need to step back a bit and look at your own behaviour and the part it plays. You seem very brittle and I wonder why? While it's annoying that your sister-in-law's father makes these comments, he may be trying to be friends with you. Some people are gauche but with good intent. Why don't you either tell him how you feel directly, instead of hiding behind your parents, or go with it and jokingly make some comments back? If you're being upset, upset the family peace right back!</p> <p>Your definition of family is also very set isn't it? Families grow \u2013 that's part of what's wonderful about them. I agree that they way they invite you isn't as inclusive as it might be but, again, either tell them you'd like to be invited directly \u2013 in which case they have to comply or there's something up \u2013 or go with it. Some people are just very lax about stuff like that.</p> <p>Martin Weaver, NLP psychotherapist (<a href=\"http://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/\" title=\"\">www.ukcp.org.uk</a>) wonders, \"When were you able to say what you really thought and needed? And when did you first learn that not being honest about someone's comments was the best strategy? What do you think is really going to happen if you assert what you want?\"</p> <p>From the sound of it, the answer to the latter question is that you fear not being heard. But I wonder how much of what you want is being effectively communicated with your family and how much you're \"suffering in silence\"?</p> <p>I also wondered if your brother was older or younger? If younger, I wonder if this all goes back to when he was born. Did you feel pushed out? If younger, do you feel he is hitting \"milestones\" (marriage/babies) before you? I think you need to do some work, maybe with a good friend or therapist, and look at the situation as calmly and dispassionately as you can. While I understand your insecurity, you do need to keep it in proportion: your family is not being taken away from you, it's evolving. It's really up to you whether you go with it.</p> <h2>Your problems solved</h2> <p>Contact Annalisa Barbieri, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU or email <a href=\"https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=mail&amp;passive=true&amp;rm=false&amp;continue=https://mail.google.com/mail/?view%3Dcm%26ui%3D1%26fs%3D1%26tf%3D1%26to%3Dannalisa.barbieri@mac.com%26su%26body&amp;scc=1&amp;ltmpl=default&amp;ltmplcache=2\" title=\"\">annalisa.barbieri@mac.com</a>.

Very much.\u201d</p> <p>For three days, I can\u2019t speak to my son. I can hardly bear to look at him. I decide this is rational. The last thing we need, I think, is an explosion of white-hot words that everyone carries around for the rest of their lives, engraved on their hearts. In any case, I\u2019m not even sure what it is I want to say. In my mind\u2019s eye I stand there, a bitter old woman with pursed lips wringing my black-gloved hands. He\u2019s done the one thing that I\u2019ve said for years, please don\u2019t do this. It would really upset me if you did this. And now it\u2019s happened. So there\u2019s nothing left to say.</p> <p>I know you can\u2019t control what your children do. Why would you want to, anyway? If you controlled what they did, you\u2019d just pass on your own rubbish tip of imperfections. You hope the next generation will be better, stronger, more generous. I know all you can do as a parent is to pack their bags and wave as you watch them go.</p> <p>So I cry instead. I have a lump in my throat that stops me from eating. I feel as if someone has died. I keep thinking of his skin, his precious skin, inked like a pig carcass.</p> <p>My neighbour says, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of it about. So many teenagers are doing it.\u201d I stare at pictures of David Beckham with his flowery sleeves, Angelina Jolie all veins and scrawls. Tattoos are everywhere. They seem no more alternative than piercings these days. But I still don\u2019t understand. Sam Cam with her smudgy dolphin, the heavily tattooed at Royal Ascot \u2013 these people are role models?</p> <p>\u201cMy niece had doves tattooed on her breasts,\u201d says a friend, \u201cAnd her father said, you wait, in a few years\u2019 time they\u2019ll be vultures.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s the permanence that makes me weep. As if the Joker had made face paints from acid. Your youthful passion for ever on display, like a CD of the Smiths stapled to your forehead. The British Association of Dermatologists recently surveyed just under 600 patients with visible tattoos. Nearly half of them had been inked between the ages of 18 and 25, and nearly a third of them regretted it.</p> <p>I look up laser removal. Which is a possibility, I think miserably, that only works if you want a tattoo removed. And I\u2019m not in charge here. My son is.</p> <p>My husband asks, \u201cHave you seen it yet?\u201d</p> <p>I shake my head. Like a child, I am hoping that if I keep my eyes tightly shut the whole thing will disappear.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s his body,\u201d he says gently. \u201cHis choice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what if he wants to be a lawyer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA lawyer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr an accountant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be wearing a suit. No one will ever know. And he doesn\u2019t want to be a lawyer. Or an accountant.\u201d</p> <p>I know. I know.</p> <p>I meet a colleague for lunch. \u201cHe knew how much it would hurt me,\u201d I say, tears running down my face. \u201cFor years I\u2019ve said, don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s there for ever, even after you\u2019ve changed your mind about who you are and what you want to look like. You\u2019re branded, like meat. It can damage your work prospects. It can turn people against you before you\u2019ve even opened your mouth.\u201d</p> <p>She says, \u201cTell him how you feel.\u201d</p> <p>But I can\u2019t. For a start, I know I\u2019m being completely unreasonable. This level of grief is absurd. He\u2019s not dying, he hasn\u2019t killed anyone, he hasn\u2019t volunteered to fight on behalf of a military dictatorship. But I feel as though a knife is twisting in my guts.</p> <p>I get angry with myself. This is nothing but snobbery, I think \u2013 latent anxiety about the trappings of class. As if my son had deliberately turned his back on a light Victoria sponge and stuffed his face with cheap doughnuts. I am aware, too, that I associate tattoos on men with aggression, the kind of arrogant swagger that goes with vest tops, dogs on chains, broken beer glasses.</p> <p>Is this what other women feel? Or perhaps, I think, with an uncomfortable lurch of realisation, just what older women feel. I stand, a lone tyrannosaurus, bellowing at a world I don\u2019t understand.</p> <p>Tattoos used to be the preserve of criminals and toffs. And sailors. In the 1850s, the corpses of seamen washed up on the coast of north Cornwall were \u201cstrangely decorated\u201d with blue, according to Robert Hawker, the vicar of Morwenstow \u2013 initials, or drawings of anchors, flowers or religious symbols (\u201cOur blessed Saviour on His Cross, with on the one hand His mother, and on the other St John the Evangelist\u201d). \u201cIt is their object and intent, when they assume these signs,\u201d says Hawker, \u201cto secure identity for their bodies if their lives are lost at sea.\u201d</p> <p>Tattoos, then, were intensely practical, like brightly coloured smit marks on sheep.</p> <p>Perhaps even then this was a fashion statement, a badge of belonging. Or just what you did after too much rum. Later, the aristocracy flirted with body art. According to the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich (they know a lot about tattoos), Edward VII had a Jerusalem cross on his arm while both his sons, the Duke of Clarence and the Duke of York (later George V), had dragon tattoos. Lady Randolph Churchill, Winston\u2019s mum, had a snake on her wrist.</p> <p>But you can do what you like if you\u2019re rich.</p> <p>On day three, still in a fog of misery, I say to him, \u201cShall we talk?\u201d</p> <p>We sit down with cups of coffee. I open my mouth to speak and end up crying instead. I say, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have done anything to hurt me more.\u201d</p> <p>He is cool and detached. He says, \u201cI think you need to re-examine your prejudices.\u201d</p> <p>I think, but I have! I\u2019ve done nothing else for three days! But I don\u2019t say that because we aren\u2019t really talking to each other. These are rehearsed lines, clever insults flung across the dispatch box. (This is what comes of not exploding in anger in the heat of the moment.)</p> <p>I say, \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have waited until you\u2019d left home? Why now when you\u2019re living here half the year?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve been thinking about for a long time. There didn\u2019t seem any reason to wait.\u201d</p> <p>Which makes it worse.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m an adult,\u201d he says. \u201cI paid for it with my own money. Money I earned.\u201d</p> <p>But we\u2019re supporting you as well, I think. As far as I know, you don\u2019t have separate bank accounts for your various income streams. So who knows? Maybe we paid for it. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to see it, that\u2019s fine,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I\u2019m at home, I\u2019ll cover it up. Your house, your rules.\u201d</p> <p>In my head, I think, I thought it was your house, too.</p> <p>He says, \u201cI\u2019m upset that you\u2019re upset. But I\u2019m not going to apologise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to apologise,\u201d I say. (A lie. Grovelling self-abasement might help.)</p> <p>He says, \u201cI\u2019m still the same person.\u201d</p> <p>I look at him, sitting there, my 21-year-old son. I feel I\u2019m being interviewed for a job I don\u2019t even want. I say, \u201cBut you\u2019re not. You\u2019re different. I will never look at you in the same way again. It\u2019s a visceral feeling. Maybe because I\u2019m your mother. All those years of looking after your body \u2013 taking you to the dentist and making you drink milk and worrying about green leafy vegetables and sunscreen and cancer from mobile phones. And then you let some stranger inject ink under your skin. To me, it seems like self-mutilation. If you\u2019d lost your arm in a car accident, I would have understood. I would have done everything to make you feel better. But this \u2013 this is desecration. And I hate it.\u201d</p> <p>We look at each other. There seems nothing left to say.</p> <p>Over the next few days, my son \u2013 always covered up \u2013 talks to me as if the row had never happened. I talk to him, too, but warily. Because I\u2019m no longer sure I know him.</p> <p>And this is when I realise that all my endless self-examination was completely pointless. What I think, or don\u2019t think, about tattoos is irrelevant. Because this is the point. Tattoos are fashionable. They may even be beautiful. (Just because I hate them doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m right.) But by deciding to have a tattoo, my son took a meat cleaver to my apron strings. He may not have wanted to hurt me. I hope he didn\u2019t. But my feelings, as he made his decision, were completely unimportant.</p> <p>The stars are not wanted now: put out every one; pack up the moon and dismantle the sun.</p> <p>I am redundant. And that\u2019s a legitimate cause for grief, I think.</p> <p><em>Tess Morgan is a pseudonym</em></p>",
  "<p>In December 2009 a handful of music bloggers received an email from an anonymous account. The email had a link to a YouTube video called \u2013 rather snappily \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPFM3DUVT-8\" title=\"\">Prelude 699130082.451322-5.4.21.3.1.20.9.15.14.1.12</a>. In it, a naked woman was glimpsed curled up in a swirl of jet-black liquid, intercut with shots of blackened limbs emanating from giant oak trees while a soundtrack of ambient electronica burbled in the background. It turned out to be the first of six Prelude videos, generating a level of online intrigue that big-name pop stars can only dream of.</p> <p>With each new wonderfully creepy clip came more questions: What did the numerical titles mean? What was the significance of all the animal imagery? Why did the woman seem to be licking semen off a tree? And, most importantly, who on earth was this enigmatic siren? Names bandied about on music forums included high-concept pop stars such as Lady Gaga, Bj\u00f6rk and, er, Christina Aguilera.</p> <p>As it turned out, our mysterious semen-licker was a Swedish singer-songwriter called Jonna Lee, in the process of reinventing herself as iamamiwhoami. Her transformation has been so convincing that, when I arrive to meet her in an ultra-modern west London hotel, it feels most incongruous. We should be in a forest, making pagan symbols out of twigs, surrounded by familiars. But with the lights off and the curtains drawn I find Lee, dressed head-to-toe in black with a shock of white hair, stood peering out of the first floor window at a fox that's curled up outside in the mid-afternoon sun. It stays there for the duration of the interview.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394520250\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/10/1344599928196/Kin-004.jpg\" alt=\"Kin\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kin video still. Photograph: John Strandh </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Strandh</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I accuse Lee of summoning it here to keep an eye on us. \"Hmm, yes,\" she says slowly, her blue eyes framed by massive fake blonde eyelashes.</p> <p>In fact, \"Hmm, yes,\" is Lee's default setting when it comes to ending sentences. This is the first proper interview she's done under the guise of iamamiwhoami, and there's a sense that she'd still rather not give too much away. Questions about various recurring motifs that run throughout Prelude, as well as the Bounty series that followed, and the most recent videos for songs from her forthcoming Kin album, are all politely rebuffed.</p> <p>I ask her if she sees herself as the same person as the one who released <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxRMI2c3Spg\">two KT Tunstall-lite solo albums</a> in her native Sweden under her birth name. \"I would say I'm the same person, but I guess I've found other sides of myself,\" she replies. \"I'm a happier person. I mean, I don't separate myself from what I do because I'm living it. Hmm, yes.\"</p> <p>Lee defines iamamiwhoami as a multimedia \"entity\" \u2013 one which, alongside her and music producer Claes Bj\u00f6rklund, includes directors, designers and close friends. Its creation was a way for Lee to submerge herself in her own world, simultaneously inviting her audience to join her while also teasing them with only snippets of information. Her identity wasn't fully revealed until the 12th video, her face initially obscured by make-up and what looked suspiciously like cellophane.</p> <p>\"Leaving space for everyone's imagination to run free is a big part of it,\" she says, \"both in terms of how we communicate and also in not being overly clear what the message is. It's kind of like receiving a script for a movie and reading it while you're watching it.\" One of the main reasons for this lack of a defining message was the fact that Lee herself didn't really know what she wanted iamamiwhoami to be, hence the moniker. Was she aware of the fuss the early videos caused?</p> <p>\"Yes. It was unavoidable but I just needed to close the door around me and think, 'OK, let's focus on this,' because I needed to develop it as some sort of form. I had to work out if it was reality or a brief moment. I knew that once all the talk had settled, the work would still be there, and I wanted to create a world where I could stay.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HouIf-PXpJs?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HouIf-PXpJs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HouIf-PXpJs\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to view</a></p> <p>While her videos are typically uploaded within weeks of completion, opening up a direct line of communication between artist and audience, there's still a sense of barriers being raised. In November 2010 she let one \"lucky\" person into her world after appealing to her fans to find a representative to appear in To Whom It May Concern, an hour-long webcast that opened with Lee driving off with the sole audience member in a battered Volvo and performing for him from the top of a man-made pyramid of cardboard boxes before luring him into a coffin and seemingly burning him alive. \"It was just the way it had to be, I'm sorry to say,\" Lee explains. \"Now may he rest in peace.\"</p> <p>There's a glint in her eye that returns when I tell her I'm concerned about the fact that a black cat that starred in a number of early videos seems to have disappeared. \"Everything has its purpose and sometimes things fade away slowly and sometimes they reappear,\" she purrs.</p> <p>For all their intellectual posturing \u2013 the Prelude videos deal extensively with the myth of the mandragora officinarum, which claims that the semen of a hanged man produces the hallucinatory root \u2013 there's humour buried within. In the video for Play, for example, ridiculous-looking yetis dance around with a semi-nude Lee to the song's drip-feed R&amp;B, looking like Hype Williams directing a racy episode of Harry And The Hendersons. Then there's the merchandise. Released to coincide with her debut album Kin, you can now buy iamamiwhoami pants. Apparently this is \"a comment regarding the way we consume things\" and fits \"into what it needs to be for people to grasp it\". Is she saying we'll understand where she's coming from once we pull on a pair of her kecks? \"I think, definitely,\" she says. \"I can't imagine anything more sexy than that.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394520251\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/10/1344599982991/Kin-video-still-004.jpg\" alt=\"Kin video still\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kin video still. Photograph: John Strandh </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sex seems to be on Lee's mind today, albeit in a typically abstract way. I ask her why she's decided to physically release Kin, given that the songs are already available to buy digitally and the videos have been online since the start of the year. From what I can gather, it's because when she played her first live show in front of an audience at last summer's Way Out West festival, something \"happened\".</p> <p>\"There was a close encounter with the audience that started the process of making Kin, so I felt that it needed to be touched and held in people's hands,\" she explains. During the show, Lee writhed around on a giant pile of loo rolls \u2013 \"It was a bed,\" she corrects, \"assigned for action\" \u2013 with her back to the audience but looking at a giant screen showing their faces. Lee talks about the album's \"physical birth\" and the \"nine months of hard labour\" that it took to create it. Noticing an extended metaphor looming, I suggest that maybe now she should be looking after the baby/album. \"The audience needs to care for it.\" Is she giving it up for adoption? \"It's always going to be my baby. I'm a very proud mother. I'm just sharing it.\"</p> <p>Given the mythmaking that's surrounded the project, it's testament to how great the songs are that Kin works equally well once stripped of its visuals. Lee's voice is delicate and otherworldly, weaving its way through warm synth blasts and creeping percussion. It's also impressive that she's managed to keep people's attention after that initial thrill of the unknown subsided.</p> <p>\"I wouldn't have done interviews earlier,\" she says, as we get up to check on the fox. \"It would have all looked like a big promotional campaign. I would have been a sad person for a long time. I can't say that I would have been here now. But it's evolved in a way that we can still do it.\" She pauses. \"Hmm, yes.\"</p> <p><em>Kin is out on 10 September</em></p>",
  "<p>Householders who want to install solar panels on their roof, but can't stump up the cash, can now obtain a specialist loan to buy a system and keep all the income it generates.</p> <p>Installer <a href=\"http://www.engensa.com/\" title=\"\">Engensa</a> has started offering the loans at a competitive 7.9% APR. They are for up to \u00a350,000, have to be taken over 10 years, but can be repaid at any time without the early repayment charges that many lenders impose.</p> <p>The company has partnered with Hitachi Finance to offer the unsecured loans and says that around 85% of applicants should be accepted, provided they can fulfil certain basic criteria \u2013 such as that they have a job and are a homeowner. The credit check, it says, would be similar to that for a mobile phone contract.</p> <p>Engensa says it is charging buyers the same to install the electricity generating system whether they take out one of its loans, or pay in cash.</p> <p>Homeowners will own the system and keep all the income it generates through feed-in tariffs (Fits). They will not suffer the problems associated with \"rent-a-roof\" schemes, which were initially popular but have since run into problems with mortgage providers. Such deals benefitted suppliers of the systems, but offered small savings for the householder.</p> <p>Despite big cuts to Fits by the government, falls in the price of a system mean the returns are still generous \u2013 a claimed 10% depending on the size, price paid and future electricity prices.</p> <p>Currently, anyone installing a PV system before 1 December will get 16p per kWh generated \u2013 down from 41.3p when Fits were first introduced in 2010. The export tariff \u2013 the amount paid for each unit of electricity generated and not used by the household \u2013&#xa0;has been increased to 4.5p a unit.</p> <p>Engensa says it is currently charging \u00a36,800, including VAT, to install a 4kWp solar system, which looks to be a good price when compared to the rest of the market. These were costing close to \u00a320,000 just two years ago.</p> <p>One major drawback to this loan offer is that the company only offers installations \"south of Birmingham\".</p> <p>Engensa founder Toby Darbyshire says the returns are still attractive. \"The loans will enable people who have been put off by the price. Once installed, the householder owns the system, and will take all the money generated just as if they had bought it&#xa0;for cash.\"</p> <p>He says that a family purchasing a 4kWp solar system for \u00a36,800, including VAT, will pay back \u00a39,755 or \u00a381 a&#xa0;month.</p> <p>This particular system will generate around 3,732kWh of electricity each year working out at \u00a3702 of feed-in tariff revenue and around \u00a3284 of electricity savings \u2013 you get to use as much free power as you can when the panels are generating.</p> <p>\"In total, over 20 years, this family will make \u00a318,057 without ever paying a penny, as well as lowering their carbon footprint and adding value to their home,\" he says.</p> <p>An alternative is to take out a standard commercial loan from a bank, where rates currently start at 5.9% from providers such as Sainsbury's Bank, Yorkshire and Clydesdale Banks and Marks &amp; Spencer. However, only those with the perfect or near-perfect credit files obtain the cheapest advertised rates.</p> <p>Darbyshire says the offer has been set up to try to get as many people as possible generating power from their homes, and there are no restrictions on roof angle or direction. It is up to the consumer to do the figures (with help from the installer) to decide what return they get.</p> <p>One issue that may be a problem for some will be the new stipulation that consumers must have an energy efficient home to enable them to receive the Fit payments. That means at least Band D following an energy audit. Homes with plenty of insulation and double glazing but an old boiler will probably fail.</p> <p>Engensa will be offering loans to allow homeowners to upgrade their boiler from next spring.</p> <p>Homeowners considering installing an Engensa solar system can find out if they are eligible for SolarLoan <a href=\"http://www.engensa.com/solarloan/\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Students starting university in September this year and paying \u00a39,000 tuition fees, will graduate with debt averaging an astonishing \u00a353,000, according to the National Union of Students. Yet separate research suggests that the typical undergraduate is spending nearly twice as much chatting on their mobile, or surfing the internet, than they spend on books.</p> <p>Estimates about the average student cost of living vary widely. The Save the Student! website found, in May, that the typical cost of living, after tuition fees, is \u00a3640 a month, with rent, predictably, the highest element at \u00a3230.</p> <p>But the National Union of Students says accommodation costs can be much higher. It found that rent for a 39-week academic year in 2011/12 averaged \u00a35,348 in London (\u00a3594 a month) and \u00a34,224 outside (\u00a3469).</p> <p>First-year students usually pay the most, as they tend to go into halls of residence which may include a food plan. For example, the University of Birmingham charges nearly \u00a37,000 for a 42-week year to stay in its Mason residence, which includes a meal plan. Its cheapest self-catering deal for freshers starts at \u00a33,255. Many students save on sky-high college rents by switching to lower-cost private accommodation in their second year.</p> <p>The relatively small amounts spent on books, compared to booze, has always been controversial. Now it appears that student spending on mobile phones has surpassed that on course materials. <a href=\"http://www.savethestudent.org/\">Save the Student!</a> estimates that the typical student spends \u00a324 a month on their mobile phone, plus another \u00a312 a month on the&#xa0;internet and home phone connections.</p> <p>Meanwhile, it says that books and stationery add up to only \u00a320 a month. The NUS, though, says that spending on books and equipment is closer to \u00a3125 a month.</p> <p>Inevitably, all the figures are averages and estimates. Individual experience will vary enormously. To get a warts-and-all view, we asked a number of students and recent graduates about their experience. Some, understandably, wanted to be anonymous.</p> <h2><strong>The rich</strong></h2> <p><strong> Expensive food and designer drugs </strong>Jemima, a history graduate from the University of Leeds, told us: \"I didn't really worry about money when I was 18. That's because I had generous parents, so I didn't feel like I had anything to worry about. My biggest expense was probably food. I didn't shop around, and got used to having convenience food. My house was weird, because we didn't eat like students. We spent lots on food because everyone's parents were rich and we could afford it. We were all very bratty.</p> <p>\"Also, I think I'm the only person in my house who used their student loan to pay their fees. Most of the housemates put their loans in high interest Isas or some other investments and got their parents to pay their fees. Which is a bit sneaky because they could come out of university in profit. It only worked if you had rich parents!</p> <p>\"With some of my friends, drugs are a huge expenditure. Their parents work in banking or finance, so they can afford to keep up a \u00a350-\u00a375 a week cocaine habit. This isn't uncommon, either. I knew people who, on a night out, would buy drugs rather than food because then they wouldn't feel hungry. Drugs are really easy to get a hold of \u2026 dealers operate on a pizza delivery model. You ring a number, place your order and it gets delivered to your doorstep.\"</p> <h2>The rest</h2> <p><strong>Halls of residence, clothes and fast food </strong>Kate Markham, a medical student at the University of Sheffield, said: \"I'm almost in my sixth year so my expenses have changed. Like most students, in my first year I spent a lot on alcohol, nights out, and clothes. Probably too much on clothes \u2026 about \u00a330 a week, which is ridiculous.</p> <p>\"Now the bulk of my money goes on rent and my car. I have to drive to my placement every day, which isn't in the centre of the city so I need a car. I can't have any silly expenses any more.</p> <p>\"My dad taught me a lot about finances, so I'm pretty good about it. I worked during the first three years at uni. I was responsible with my spending and saved a lot.</p> <p>\"I wouldn't really change anything because I had a really good time. But I would advise people going to university to do their research and just be smart about it.\"</p> <p>Alex Evans, a biology student at the University of Leeds, said: \"I wish I'd known more about student loans before getting one. I think I rushed into it because it was the thing to do, but I didn't really check what my options were, which I really regret, especially now the time is coming to pay stuff off.</p> <p>\"To be honest, alcohol came cheap enough when you knew what to buy. I only ever bought one book, and I didn't run up any library fines \u2026 but I've heard they can be horrendous. That's definitely one to keep an eye out for, because it's just throwing money away.</p> <p>\"I've learned to avoid spending too much on fast food, that's the thing that saps all my cash. If it's dinner, or fried chicken or pizza on the way home from a night out, I'll wake up the next day with the week's shopping money converted to chicken bones.\"</p> <p>Lissie Day, an English student at the University of Leeds, said: \"For starters, I'm really glad I didn't go into an expensive hall of residence. Some of my friends' maintenance loans didn't cover half the rent. I'm glad I decided to be stingy from the beginning.</p> <p>\"I mainly spent money on nights out. I'm not really sure how I could have made that cheaper, to be honest, aside from, maybe, bulk-buying drinks online when there were deals, rather than making multiple trips to the corner shop .</p> <p>\"I also wish I'd gone for the student bank account that offered a free 16-25 railcard because train travel is insanely expensive and that would have really helped when I wanted to go home for the weekend, and away for holidays.\"</p>",
  "<p>The A-level results will be the first step to university for many young people \u2013 and the start of financial independence. But there are 10 tips that every 18-year-old should be armed with before they start in October:</p> <h2><strong>Banks are not your friends </strong></h2> <p>This is the top tip from consumer campaigner Martin Lewis, founder of <a href=\"http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/\" title=\"\">MoneySavingExpert.com.</a> He says: \"The sign in front of the member of bank staff may say 'money adviser' but don't be fooled \u2013 it should read 'salesperson'.\" Often their primary job is to sell you their products, and they will only do it from their own, usually poor range. Often the person you're talking to is paid based on how many things they can tie you into. Ask yourself: do you want to be the loyal customer whose business is taken for granted, or the customer whose business is hard won with better deals? Do your own research before getting any financial product. Ask yourself whether you need it, is it worth it, and have you checked whether it's the best deal on the market.\"</p> <h2><strong>Be boring. Budget</strong></h2> <p>Yes, it's boring, but if you're going to live on the money you've got, and afford a social life too, you need to learn to budget. Make a weekly or monthly budget and stick to it. Try using an online student budget calculator, such as the one on the Ucas website, which allows you to key in all your income and outgoings. Other tips:</p> <p>\u2022 Try not to use your debit card to pay for things. It's easier to keep track if you pay cash. When going out drinking, only take with you the amount you're happy to spend that night, and no plastic cards.</p> <p>\u2022 Before you buy something, ask yourself: Do I really need it? Can I afford it? Can I get it cheaper elsewhere? If any one answer is no, think again.</p> <p>\u2022 Don't use cash machines that charge for withdrawals. Find out which ATMs charge and which don't.</p> <h2><strong>Don't get a car</strong></h2> <p>It's a money pit. Particularly for young males \u2013 insurance costs can be crazy (\u00a35,000 a year or more). And if you're off to university, you can't get away with going on mum or dad's insurance, or \"fronting\" as it's known. In any case, the other costs of car ownership can stack up: vehicle tax (\u00a3200+ a year), petrol (who knows), and if you're buying an old banger, the repair and tyre replacement bills can be huge. Then there's the minimum \u00a350 or so for the AA or RAC to rescue you when it goes wrong.</p> <h2><strong>Mobile phones are another money pit</strong></h2> <p>But we know you won't listen to sense on this. Still, don't just throw money away \u2013 if you've already got a smartphone, or can get hold of one from a sibling who is upgrading, you can save by switching to a sim-only tariff. You can get 300 call minutes, unlimited texts and 500MB of data for \u00a310.50 a month from Vodafone (via websites such as <a href=\"http://www.simonlycontracts.co.uk/\" title=\"\">simonlycontracts.co.uk</a>), or unlimited packages for \u00a321 a month from T-Mobile.</p> <h2><strong>Travel bills are extortionate</strong></h2> <p>One of the biggest surprises students report is how much they have to pay on trains, buses and tubes. So get a 16-25 Railcard \u2013 it costs \u00a328 for one year, or \u00a365 for three, and gives you a third off UK rail fares. Sadly, NatWest has made it harder to get one for free on its student account. Or take the bus \u2013 check <a href=\"http://uk.megabus.com/\" title=\"\">Megabus</a> for low-cost deals.</p> <h2><strong>Debt isn't bad, but bad debt is</strong></h2> <p>This is another of Martin Lewis's favourite lessons. \"Grandparents may tell you never to borrow, but sadly that isn't realistic in this modern world. If you want to go to university or own your own house, you're almost certainly going to need to borrow at some point. What scares me about people who encourage debt abstinence is it forgets that not all debt is the same, and the most important skill is working out the difference between good and bad debt. Work out whether the repayments are affordable, ensure the borrowing is necessary, not just lusted for, keep the amount to a minimum and check that it is at the cheapest rate possible. Debt isn't bad, but bad debt certainly is.\"</p> <h2><strong>Money isn't everything, but goals are important</strong></h2> <p>Simon Nixon, founder of <a href=\"http://www.moneysupermarket.com/\" title=\"\">MoneySupermarket.com</a>, one of Britain's most successful entrepreneurs reputedly worth around \u00a3400m, says: \"Read the papers, watch the news and follow some of the great money pundits on Twitter and online. Whether it is getting into the habit of saving regularly with the goal of helping pay for further education, the deposit for a new home, or buying your first car, having a goal can keep you focused when the urge to spend creeps in. If you are planning on using credit, do so wisely \u2013 remember, it is not free money and it does need to be repaid. Getting it wrong can have an impact for the rest of your life. But money isn't everything \u2013 making a lot of money shouldn't be the sole motivation you have, or you'll miss out on a lot of the best experiences along the way.\"</p> <h2><strong>Pre-loading to save on bar costs</strong></h2> <p>We're not endorsing this, but we can't ignore what hundreds of thousands of young adults do to cut the cost of going out. Pre-loading (otherwise known as \"pre-drinks\") is about buying cheap alcohol from the supermarket or off-licence and drinking it at home before you hit the pub/club. It can be a cost-effective way of boozing \u2013 but health campaigners warn of the dangers. \"Drinking while getting ready with your mates might seem normal, but drinking a lot of alcohol before you go out could make your night take a different direction from what you've all got planned. You might not make the gig or party, be too ill to get in the taxi or club and spend the night in the loos being sick, or worse \u2013 in hospital,\" says Drinkaware, a charity that promotes responsible drinking.</p> <h2><strong>Don't pay tax</strong></h2> <p>Students in the UK are liable for income tax and national insurance contributions (NICs) on their earnings, like everyone else. If you work for an employer during the term, you'll pay income tax if you earn over a certain amount \u2013 \u00a38,105 for the tax year 2012-13. You'll also pay NICs if you earn over \u00a3146 a week. But if you are a full-time student and only work in the holidays and your total income for the year is below the \u00a38,105 personal allowance, you won't need to pay tax through PAYE provided you fill out form P38(S), available from your employer. Any grant you get, as well as most scholarships and bursaries, are non-taxable so you can get any or all of them and still keep your full personal allowance. When a scholarship comes from your employer, any income for periods of work (eg in the holidays) will be taxable and attract NICs in the normal way.</p> <h2><strong>If you work, don't let your employer take you for a&#xa0;ride</strong></h2> <p>Make sure you are being paid the minimum wage. There are different levels of national minimum wage \u2013 the current rate for those aged 18 to 20 is \u00a34.98. For those aged 21 or over it's \u00a36.08, rising to \u00a36.19 on 1 October, and the rate for 16- and 17-year-olds is \u00a33.68.</p> <p>And remember, your employer is obliged to pay you the sum you've agreed \u2013 and to pay you on time.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 August 2012. The original referred to road, rather than vehicle tax. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>It is sold as a \"peace of mind\" service for car buyers who know little about engines or mechanical matters. But one Guardian Money reader who relied on an AA inspection before buying a used Land Rover Discovery says he ended up with a car riddled with faults.</p> <p>Bristol-based software engineer Andrew Vinall's story is complicated \u2013 he bought on the basis of a verbal recommendation from the AA before the written report arrived \u2013 and the AA hotly disputes his claims.</p> <p>But Vinall says the AA and Dekra, the company subcontracted by the AA to undertake the inspection, have washed their hands of the matter, leaving him with a bill of up to \u00a32,000 to put right faults he claims should have been spotted at the inspection.</p> <p>Vinall's saga began when he and his wife, Tamara, decided they needed a car big enough for their four children. They found a 10-year-old Land Rover, which had 115,000 miles on the clock, for \u00a34,500 \u2013 a top-end price for a car of this age and mileage.</p> <p>\"Not knowing anything about cars, we thought it was prudent to get it checked out by an expert. My wife has been a loyal member of the AA for many years, so we thought we could trust them to do a good job,\" Vinall says.</p> <p>The couple paid the AA \u00a3260 for the report. \"We were keen to get on with the purchase, and the engineer agreed to ring us with his verbal findings. He said there was some rust on the chassis and went on to list what sounded like some other minor problems. He stated very clearly that the car was a fair and reasonable example of the type. I asked whether it was a good car and whether it was OK to buy it, and he said yes, assuming you like the colour,\" Vinall says. Based on the telephone conversation, and rather than wait for the report, the couple went ahead and bought the car.</p> <p>However, a rather different picture soon emerged. When the AA sent through the report it still clearly stated near the top that the car was in a \"generally reasonable condition and generally considered to be consistent with the type for the age and indicated recorded mileage in most areas\". However, it went on to list a series of problems, and warned that further investigation was recommended. In particular, it stated that the coolant had been too low to check properly, but claimed it had been pressure tested to 0.7 bars and that no pressure leaks could be seen.</p> <p>Growing alarmed, Vinall took the car to a Land Rover specialist recommended by a friend, where the mechanic declared that contrary to the report, the car was in fact in a poor condition for its age. He pointed out four leaks from the coolant system, and said the rust was significantly worse than described.</p> <p>Vinall says he has since learned that these cars should not have any rust, and the low coolant level could be a precursor to an expensive head gasket failure.</p> <p>\"I'd expected to have to spend some money on the car as I knew it was at least 10 years old. When an AA-appointed engineer says it's OK to go ahead and buy it, you assume he know's what he's talking about.\"</p> <p>Vinall complained to the small dealer who'd sold him the car who, he said, told him in no uncertain terms where to go. Interestingly, he did offer to buy the car back \u2013 for \u00a32,500, \u00a32,000 less than he had received and probably around its true value.</p> <p>\"We have complained to the AA, but because they subcontract the work to Dekra they will not deal with the complaint even though we paid the AA. Dekra has just shrugged off the complaint with a 'no guarantee/warranty' statement and I've been left wondering what we paid for.\"</p> <p>Vinall confesses he should have waited for the written version of the report: \"In hindsight we would have acted more slowly. But we still feel ripped off and extremely let down by an organisation that is supposedly the champion of motorists.\"</p> <p>A look on the internet shows Vinall is not the only unhappy vehicle inspection customer. One of the problems is that the terms and conditions of such policies have get-outs that mean the inspector won't be held liable in cases such as these.</p> <p>A spokesman for the AA says the engineer has denied saying the car was fine to buy. Vinall will now have to take his case to the small claims court if he want to pursue the matter. He may have a reasonable case, particularly concerning the leaks to the coolant system, which were missed, but that will be for the court to decide.</p> <p>The AA said: \"Mr Vinall purchased the vehicle prior to receiving the complete, written report, required to make an informed, considered decision.</p> <p>\"The report highlighted various essential and advisable repairs and summarised that the vehicle is 'not suitable for purchase unless all essential repairs are undertaken and advisable repairs, if any, are planned and budgeted for'. Our vehicle inspections provider refutes that the engineer suggested otherwise and does not accept any liability. We are satisfied that the report highlighted the relevant areas for further investigation prior to making any purchase decision.\"</p>",
  "<p>Thomas Bernard McFeely could not have been more indignant. The Irish woman who has become the bane of his life, Theresa McGuinness, had challenged <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/31/tom-mcfeely-declared-bankrupt-ireland\" title=\"\">his UK bankruptcy</a>. \"As a&#xa0;British citizen I have always objected to being forced into bankruptcy in a&#xa0;foreign jurisdiction,\" he informed the high court in London in June. \"I maintain this is a&#xa0;breach of my human rights.\"</p> <p>The foreign jurisdiction in question is Ireland, where hollow laughter greeted McFeely's sudden declaration of Britishness. After all, this is a man who once believed so fiercely in his Irishness that he fought in the IRA. He refused to recognise the British court that sentenced him in Northern Ireland in the 1970s, went on hunger strike and was prepared to die in the notorious H blocks in 1980. He later broke from Sinn F\u00e9in to join the League of Communist Republicans. Then he became a&#xa0;multimillionaire property developer.</p> <p>McFeely is bankrupt in Ireland now and will be&#xa0;out of business for 12 years. He is embroiled in&#xa0;numerous other court proceedings. His Victorian mansion on one of Dublin's most expensive avenues has been repossessed by the&#xa0;state. He says it's because he's a \"Nordie\"; that he is a victim of southern Irish prejudice against northerners, exacerbated by the global economic crisis. Few, however, see him as a&#xa0;victim. McFeely&#xa0;needn't worry about a roof over his head. His creditors, on the other hand, include&#xa0;several hundred people who bought apartments from him in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/26/priory-hall-ireland-raises-safety-fears-about-boom-developers\" title=\"\">Priory Hall</a>, a&#xa0;development deemed so dangerous it was evacuated with fire crews standing by.</p> <p>One Irish newspaper editorial recently said of McFeely that he lives on a \"different moral planet to the rest of us\". However, McFeely's planet is entirely recognisable as contemporary Ireland. His dramatic rise to wealth was encouraged and facilitated by successive governments of a&#xa0;Republic that each year commemorates the egalitarian ideals of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/21/easter-rising-dublin-1916\" title=\"\">1916 Easter Rising</a>. A&#xa0;Republic that is, according to the findings of the&#xa0;recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/feedarticle/10156832\" title=\"\">Mahon tribunal</a>, endemically corrupt.</p> <p>McFeely's spectacular fall is mirrored by those of dozens of other developers and bankers, many of whom are queueing up to take advantage of more lenient bankruptcy laws in the UK and the US. Some have hidden billions abroad. Those paying for the excesses of the Celtic Tiger are ordinary Irish people, such as the former residents of Priory Hall, who took out inflated 20- or 30-year mortgages just before the bubble burst.</p> <p>Ireland, puffed up for a decade on the success of its peace process and the booming of its economy, is now bust, a land of zombie banks, ghost estates and empty monster hotels. Irish sovereignty, fought for by generations, has largely been forfeited to the so-called troika of the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission.</p> <p>McFeely regards journalists as \"scum\". We meet at the headquarters of his main Irish company, Coalport. The building is on the edge of one of Dublin's grandest Georgian squares, but its large boardroom is as sparse as a prison cell. Grubby white walls, a basic table and chairs, a&#xa0;single poster of the Manhattan skyline. He takes the seat at the head of the table. He tells me he used to have antiques in the boardroom, but the sheriff took them. He fields calls. One, he says, is from a bank manager in Portugal, where he also has property problems.</p> <p>He was born in 1949, the eldest son in a&#xa0;Catholic family of 13, in Farkland, County Derry. His grandfather joined the British army and was injured in the first world war. His uncle was in the British marines and was killed in action. \"My&#xa0;grandmother never forgave the British army for taking her son. She was one hell of a lady. She&#xa0;had presence. Her daughter, my mother, was fairly militant.\" His father was a cattle dealer and more of a nationalist than a republican.</p> <p>McFeely says he will never forget the family home being wrecked during a raid by \"the B men\", members of the notorious unionist Special Constabulary. \"You'd have thought a bomb had hit the place.\" The \"B Specials\" were usually local&#xa0;men; the poet Seamus Heaney, also from Co&#xa0;Derry, called them \"<a href=\"http://www.cstone.net/~poems/twopohea.htm\" title=\"\">neighbours with guns</a>\".</p> <p>McFeely went to school in Derry. \"There were&#xa0;houses that were semi-derelict. It was primitive to say the least. I remember seeing roofs&#xa0;with the slates in a big hollow in the middle.\" He left school at 14 and worked with a farmer until he was old enough to get on to a building site. When he was 15, there was an election. He was sent out to vote for the nationalist candidate, but voted instead for the republican: \"I had a mind of my own.\" He served his time as a bricklayer, working from 7am till 9pm. \"Everything I've done, I was diligent at it. I&#xa0;was 'on the grip', paid by the brick.\"</p> <p>He went to England in 1968 and got work straight away. \"The 5th of October brought me back. It was typical of what I had learned all my life \u2013 we were a people to be put down in our own country,\" he says. He is referring to the violent attack by the police on a civil rights march through Derry. Discrimination was institutionalised in Northern Ireland but was particularly acute in Derry, shortly to be dubbed \"the capital city of injustice\" by Bernadette Devlin (then a leading civil rights campaigner and soon to become Britain's youngest ever woman MP). Housing was at the heart of it, with&#xa0;disenfranchised and unemployed nationalists living in poverty in desperately overcrowded slums.</p> <p>The Troubles had started, and McFeely pitched in: \"I would always have been up at the front of the riots where the hand-to-hand fighting went on.\" Though he has boasted of wielding a&#xa0;hatchet, he says he also listened to the speeches and particularly admired Devlin and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eamonn_McCann\" title=\"\">Eamonn McCann</a>. \"I was taken by the socialism. We were all downtrodden, even a lot of the Protestants, though they thought they were aristocracy.\" He&#xa0;stopped practising Catholicism in 1971. \"As&#xa0;Lenin said, it is the opium of the people.\"</p> <p>His activism quickly \"morphed into\" IRA involvement. \"It was a way of getting back at the state.\" Facing six months in jail, he went on the run in the Republic, but missed the action and his fiancee: \"I couldn't stay away.\" He got married and had two daughters. He set out to bomb the new dole office in Antrim, where he had bought a house. There was a chase, he was cornered, punched a policeman in the face, escaped, went on the run in the Republic, got caught, was jailed, escaped again. \"I went back to the north,\" he says, \"which was hot and heavy.\"</p> <p>He knew <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/martin-mcguinness\" title=\"\">Martin McGuinness</a>, who admits he led the IRA in Derry at the time of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/bloodysunday\" title=\"\">Bloody Sunday</a> in 1972, but claims to have left by 1974. \"Martin was game. Martin was all right. It's not like him to leave in the middle of a good row,\" McFeely says with heavy sarcasm.</p> <p>McFeely was not, he says, involved in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2010/aug/24/claudy-bombing-report-priest-northern-ireland\" title=\"\">1972 bombing of Claudy</a>, a few miles from his childhood home. Nine people were killed, with no warnings given. \"But if I'd been there I would have planted the bombs. It is the reality of war. I&#xa0;only regret I wasn't able to do more.\"</p> <p>After carrying out an armed robbery on a post office, he and another IRA man took over a rural house, which was put under siege by the security forces. \"It was a bit wild west, to be honest. The idea was to go out and take as many of them out as possible.\" He shot a policeman (who survived) and when he eventually gave himself up, he expected to be shot dead. He got away with \"a&#xa0;fair decent beating\" but was sentenced to 26 years in 1977 by a judge who called him \"an extremely dangerous, intelligent and vicious young man\".</p> <p>McFeely puts his head in his hands when asked about his prison years. \"What do you tell? You got booted around, the screws would come in with drink on them and raid the cells, they'd spit on your food, you'd to walk naked, they'd set the dogs on you\u2026 There was fear, humiliation. I was in for the fight \u2013 I'd give the screws a damn good kicking.\"</p> <p>Screws were prison officers, mostly Protestants. He names one, \"the only evil man I ever met\", and says he is still glad he \"died a horrible death, a bomb under his car \u2013 he was mangled\". McFeely's violence meant he spent a lot of time \"on the boards\" (in solitary confinement).</p> <p>After the British ceased to recognise IRA members as political prisoners, McFeely was the OC (officer in command) of those who refused to wear the prison uniform and went \"on the blanket\". This escalated into the \"dirty protest\". The prisoners stopped washing; they urinated in their cells and smeared excrement on the walls. Soon the cells were crawling with maggots and prison officers wore gas masks against the stink.</p> <p>McFeely, described by another IRA prison leader as \"a very, very strong character\", was one of seven chosen to go on hunger strike, and was regarded as probably the most determined of them all. His face, gaunt, young, rakishly handsome back then, was on the posters that were carried on demonstrations in Belfast, Dublin and London. Halfway through, another prisoner described seeing McFeely: \"It was frightening. He looked like a skeleton with skin pulled over him.\" After 53 days, with one man about to die and rumours of a deal with the British, the hunger strike was called off. McFeely was blind, and furious. He vehemently opposed the decision.</p> <p>He is still full of rage about what happened. The deal was useless \u2013 the hunger strike had failed. When a new one began, the leadership refused his offer to go on it. \"I had no role after that.\" The demoralisation was \"absolutely terrible\". Violence inside the prison and out on the streets continued. Ten men died on the hunger strike. Along with another ex-hunger striker, Tommy McKearney, McFeely split with Sinn F\u00e9in to set up&#xa0;the League of Communist Republicans.</p> <p>Essie Kealing was a working-class hero. She lived in a flat in a complex that had been built for Dublin's poor by one of the 1916 revolutionaries. The flats were sold in the 1970s and Kealing led an eight-year rent strike to stop the landlord from evicting the tenants. In 1999, when she was 76 and had lived in her flat for 40 years, she received several visits from the new landlord, who attempted to persuade her to move out in terms that can be guessed at from her description of him as a \"rough merchant\". This was Tom McFeely, 10&#xa0;years after his release from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_%28HM_Prison%29\" title=\"\">Long Kesh</a> prison.</p> <p>Though he had not recognised the court, McFeely had appealed against his sentence and was released in 1989. His marriage had broken up. He moved to Dublin. He likes to tell the story of his first night, sleeping in his small car, almost penniless. Hired initially by other former IRA prisoners, he went back \"on the grip\", intent upon building up his fortune brick by brick.</p> <p>He was just in time to avail himself of minister <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1draig_Flynn\" title=\"\">Padraig Flynn</a>'s new light-touch regulatory regime which allowed \"self-certification\" of compliance with the law by architects, engineers and builders. Local authorities were empowered to carry out inspections, but in reality the pace of building was soon such that they lacked the resources to do so in more than a token number of cases.</p> <p>Successive <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fianna_F%C3%A1il\" title=\"\">Fianna F\u00e1il</a> governments laid out a&#xa0;range of tax breaks and schemes which, along with low interest rates and a striking absence of regulation, were designed to encourage speculators. A government minister praised the Irish \"frontiersmen\" mentality. The New York Times said Dublin had become known as \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/01/business/worldbusiness/01irish.html\" title=\"\">something of the Wild West of European finance</a>\". Many of those who profited bankrolled the party. McFeely says he did not. \"But if I'd been asked, would I have done it? Yes. I don't know anybody with a halo.\"</p> <p>Within a couple of years, McFeely had enough money to buy a pub back home in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungiven\" title=\"\">Dungiven</a>. He&#xa0;had no fear of authority. His modus operandi, if there was a finding against him in one court, was to appeal to a higher one. There were long-running legal battles with other major developers. \"I pushed it all in front of me. I&#xa0;never&#xa0;kept money,\" he says.</p> <p>He didn't part with it readily, either. Following a&#xa0;Criminal Assets Bureau investigation in 2006, he had to pay out more than \u20ac8m in unpaid taxes, dating back to his arrival in the Republic. The following year, Coalport was the subject of no fewer than eight high court proceedings. He took out a&#xa0;loan of \u20ac10m for his house, the former German embassy, but stopped paying the mortgage. In 2009 he was ordered to repay \u20ac6.2m to a bank, as well as a&#xa0;further revenue payment of \u20ac580,000.</p> <p>McFeely's companies built houses, apartments and commercial units all over Ireland, as well as in England. He maintained the tradition of employing ex-prisoners. An absence of building experience was not a barrier. During the boom, he freely admits, \"Everything was done in a rush. The attitude was get it up, get it off, get on to the next job. Come back and finish it later.\"</p> <p>In 2002, Theresa McGuinness liked what she saw of McFeely's plans for a small development in County Dublin and paid a cash deposit of \u20ac35,000 on a house. It was a decision that would come to dominate her life for at least the following decade. Within two years she was suing McFeely. \"You could see the house was a disaster by its roof,\" she said. \"It was literally sagging in the middle. Inside, you'd have thought someone had taken a&#xa0;hammer to the place.\"</p> <p>The signs were bad for Priory Hall right from the start. The development was part of the much-vaunted new Northern Fringe. \"The idea was to develop an extension to the city of Dublin with high-density housing and good public services and transport,\" says local TD <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Broughan\" title=\"\">Tommy Broughan</a>. Many of the top developers obtained sites. McFeely's was at the southern end of what was to have been the main boulevard through the new towns of Clongriffin and Belmayne. \"They call it the boulevard of broken dreams now,\" Broughan says.</p> <p>In 2004, a woman had just dropped her children at school and was driving home along the edge of McFeely's building site when her car was crushed by steel mesh grids weighing over a tonne. She was described as having narrowly escaped death. Two years later, another woman had a narrow escape when her car was hit by a section of scaffolding falling from the same site. A health and safety inspector said this was \"one of the most unsafe\" sites he had ever inspected. The high court ordered the site to be temporarily closed because of \"systemic\" breaches of regulations.</p> <p>In the years that followed, there were complaints about estates left in an \"appalling state\", roads unfinished, \"wires sticking out of the showers\", fire hazards. After Dublin city council brought McFeely to court over problems in an estate in west Dublin, the president of the high court said there had been \"clear unwillingness\" and \"foot dragging\" by the developer.</p> <p>Clongriffin today is a sorry sight. There's a&#xa0;forlorn railway station, but most of the promised facilities were never developed. Some estates are half-empty, while others have been half-built, then abandoned. Roads end in hoardings. One&#xa0;has \"Drug dealers out\" scrawled on it.</p> <p>One public housing tenant at Priory Hall was taken to hospital because of the damp soon after it opened. Just before Christmas in 2009, the council moved its tenants out after fire inspectors deemed the buildings dangerous. Broughan demanded a debate in the Irish parliament about the \"outrageous situation\", pointing out that \"key planning and building regulations\" had obviously been ignored. McFeely undertook to do works.</p> <p>One owner agrees to take me round and talk about what happened on condition that I do not use his name. McFeely's reputation as a \"rough merchant\" has not diminished. (In May, a London high court judge found there was a \"strong suggestion\" that, based on a sham lease he had helped to devise, McFeely had received almost \u20ac4m in rents for a building near the Olympic Village in Stratford, and that he and others had intimidated the directors of the leasing company.)</p> <p>\"My wife and I bought off plans in 2005,\" the apartment owner says. \"It was our first home together. The apartments were expensive but this was the peak of the boom and the banks were throwing money at people. We brought in a&#xa0;surveyor but he was refused access.\"</p> <p>The security man on the locked-up site lets us in and we climb stained, carpeted stairs to the apartment. The living room window looks out over the abrupt end of the road and a mound of grassed-over rubble at the edge of waste ground where the boulevard was meant to be. \"We kind of knew from the start the place was blighted,\" the man says. \"The car park was always flooded. The place was damp. One morning we were woken by a&#xa0;knock on the door and it was the young couple downstairs. Their ceiling had fallen in. Sewage pipes went nowhere \u2013 just ended. We were paying a management fee but nothing was getting done.\"</p> <p>Then, one morning in October 2011, the man was driving to work when he heard on the news that the city council had gone to court to get an order for the apartments to be evacuated. Insurance companies ceased cover. Fire crews stood by as residents packed cars and vans, and moved to hotels, spare rooms and rented apartments. The high court ordered the council to pay for their accommodation \u2013 it has since appealed against this.</p> <p>\"Self-regulation is outrageous,\" the man says. \"It turns out McFeely declared the complex to be 'in substantial compliance' with all the rules and regulations, and the council just accepted that. It was crazy \u2013 we first set eyes on McFeely in court. He called us begrudgers and 'jumped-up little Hitlers'.\" One resident shouted back at the builder that he \"couldn't build a snowman\".</p> <p>At first, it was agreed that setting things right would take five weeks. Then a dispute blew up between McFeely and Dublin city council, which led to McFeely being arrested and briefly jailed, before he appealed to the supreme court, which found in his favour. When the council made public its enforcement order, the owners knew the place was doomed. \"There were 18 pages of items, most of them very serious. Basically, nothing was right.\"</p> <p>\"They crucified me,\" McFeely says of the massive tax settlement he had to make with the Criminal Assets Bureau. Having paid, he went straight out and bought a Bentley for nearly \u20ac50,000. \"I stuck my two fingers up at them. They thought they could destroy me. I'm getting hammered because I had the audacity to come down here and live on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ailesbury_Road\" title=\"\">Ailesbury Road</a>. It's the Free State mentality \u2013 I'm&#xa0;a Nordie with a republican reputation.\"</p> <p>It is certainly true that the wealthy of Dublin&#xa0;tend to be snobbish and that the huge made-in-the-H-blocks Celtic cross in McFeely's drawing room window looks incongruous. He is far from being the only local resident to be familiar with the inside of a courtroom, but is one of the few who has been in jail. His fleet of vehicles is normal for the area \u2013 though the Bentley has gone.&#xa0;\"I&#xa0;paid a lawyer with it.\" In fact, the McFeelys have been ordered to leave the house after his second wife failed to persuade the high court to let her remain there in her own right.</p> <p>McFeely says his building practices and standards are normal, and that he has co-operated with attending to any \"snags\" as required, though he disputes others' assessments of these.</p> <p>There is mounting evidence that he is right about standards \u2013 one large apartment block built by another developer has recently been evacuated as unsafe and it is likely that more will follow. \"A lot of the other developers are bad-mouthing me because they think I'm bringing the heat on them,\" McFeely says. \"But I'm no tout.\"</p> <p>He makes no apology for his British passport. \"I&#xa0;am still a republican, but I was born a British subject and I'm smarter than the rest of them. I&#xa0;fought for a socialist republic and I still believe in that. Blame the peace processers for copper-fastening the border. And by the way, you get better justice in the British courts.\"</p> <p>There is still a framed poster on the staircase of Sinn F\u00e9in's offices in Dungiven, near McFeely's old home, showing him among the 1980 hunger strikers. The museum upstairs is full of Troubles memorabilia, including a glass case containing a&#xa0;couple of AK47s and a 1977 poster demanding \"Break the connection with England \u2013 the source of all our evils\". But all has changed. Downstairs, at the front desk, there's the order of business for the Assembly at Stormont, where Martin McGuinness is now deputy first minister. The day I visit, the front pages have photos of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/27/queen-martin-mcguinness-shake-hands\" title=\"\">McGuinness and the Queen shaking hands</a>.</p> <p>McFeely's old IRA comrades are loyal. They speak of the \"rare bond\" that exists between ex-prisoners. They say they don't know much about what he is accused of in the Republic. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-13593097\" title=\"\">Sean McGlinchey</a>, now Sinn F\u00e9in mayor of Limavady, says McFeely, still a good friend despite their political differences, \"never got over\" the end of the hunger strike. \"He is no angel, but we all have our faults, we all make mistakes.\" He admits McFeely was always aggressive. \"He wouldn't go around a thing \u2013 he'd go through it. He's a bull.\"</p> <p>Down the road in Derry, Eamonn McCann, who inspired McFeely all those years ago, is still a&#xa0;campaigning socialist. \"McFeely represents something almost stereotypical,\" he says. \"A&#xa0;republican who is a property developer and a&#xa0;landlord. There is a great deal of resentment against the political establishment in the Republic. Men like McFeely feel they have done intense things 'for Ireland' and they are entitled to some return. Of course, you have Fianna F\u00e1il ministers who have also acted as if the state is something to be treated with contempt.\"</p> <p>Theresa McGuinness has no interest in any of this. She has spent the past decade fighting through the courts, representing herself, to get McFeely to pay her back the money he owes her for the house she never got. She has been more assiduous than any state agency in her pursuit of him. \"This man has put me through a pure nightmare,\" she says. \"Why should I let him get away with it?\"</p> <p>McFeely is much debated on political websites. One contributor recently said of him, it's like \"all&#xa0;that's been wrong with this land for the last 40 years\" in one man.</p>",

  "<p><strong>I fly two or three times a year from Birmingham to Rome. Until recently, there were no direct flights, so I went via Switzerland or Germany and in so doing managed to accumulate 12,800 Star Alliance \"rewards\" points on its Miles &amp; More rewards programme. Needing to book a flight for this summer, even though two other carriers now offer direct flights I decided to use up those miles. I checked how many reward miles I needed and it came up as 15,000. By purchasing an additional 3,000 miles at a cost of \u20ac85 I thought it would still be cheaper than the \u00a3120 or so for Monarch's direct flight.</strong></p> <p><strong> I went ahead and booked the flight using the points. I was alarmed when I had to put in credit card details but assumed it would be all right as I was dealing with reputable companies. However, I found that \u00a3206 had been applied to my card. </strong></p> <p><strong>I have complained and been told that I was charged because I did not have enough miles to cover the taxes and surcharges. I then went on to the Swiss Air web page and found that I could have booked a return Birmingham-Rome flight for as little as \u00a368 each way, all in. I feel utterly conned.</strong> <em>ET, Coventry</em></p> <p>For many years there's been a great deal of scepticism among consumers as to whether airline rewards programmes actually deliver, and letters like yours show why. We contacted Lufthansa, which runs the Miles &amp; More programme in Germany, and can at least confirm one thing \u2013 those using the site to \"buy\" flights, are told how much they will be expected to pay if they don't have enough points to cover the taxes and charges, which in your case would have been another 15,000 points \u2013 30,000 in total.</p> <p>A Lufthansa spokesman sent us a screen shot showing a booking, and while the figure could be more prominently displayed, it is there. You must have missed it when booking.</p> <p>Asked whether these programmes were ever worthwhile given your findings, he said they were aimed at serious flyers clocking up thousands of points a month. He conceded that it was often cheaper to book a flight directly rather than by using points.</p> <p>To get an idea of how much you would have needed to fly to get a free flight to Rome, he said that someone flying from Manchester to New York changing planes in Germany (if you could face such a journey) would receive 6,000 Miles &amp; More points. In other words, you would have had to do this five times to get enough points (30,000) to have booked you free flight to Rome. The moral of the tale, it seems, is always to check whether it is cheaper to book elsewhere rather than use rewards points.</p> <p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

  "<p>In past years, the visual arts have always appeared to take a back seat during the <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Edinburgh international festival</a>. Perhaps it seemed impossible to compete with the cacophony of the main festival, the fringe and the <a href=\"http://www.edbookfest.co.uk/\" title=\"\">book festival</a>. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/jul/30/edinburgh-art-festival-director-sorcha-carey\" title=\"\">Sorcha Carey, director of the art festival</a>, has decided to redress the balance with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-19081286\" title=\"\">Festival Promenade</a>, a series of works intended to bring the visual arts out of the galleries and into the places where people will be gathering for events. This \"magical playground\" will feature commissions allowing the artist \"to create works that interrogate their spaces\". To quote one participating artist, \"art is the thing that allows us to ask interesting questions about your life\".</p> <p>The festival's first permanent \"legacy\" installation was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YiYCMwJtj4\"><em>Martin Creed's Work No 1059</em></a>, commissioned for it by the Fruitmarket Gallery. <br>The work, 104 outdoor steps clad in differently coloured marbles, accompanied Creed's retrospective show at the gallery. This year, with a commissioning budget of \u00a3250,000, Carey has turned away from permanent installations and chosen instead to commission a daring set of new interactive works, declaring that the choice is \"unabashedly about showcasing Scottish artists\". While the ambitious list includes some well-known artists, including <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2010/dec/06/turner-prize-winner-susan-philipsz\" title=\"\">Susan Philipsz, the 2010 Turner prize winner</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.frithstreetgallery.com/artists/bio/callum_innes/?/innes.html\" title=\"\">Callum Innes</a>, a 1995 Turner prize nominee, it also embraces recent graduates of Scotland's art schools.</p> <p>Carey says her chief aim is \"to establish the delicate but important balance between the permanent and temporary in this massive World Heritage Site\". I first met her during the opening week of<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/15/arts/design/documenta-13-in-kassel-germany.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\"> dOCUMENTA (13) in Kassel,</a> where she introduced me to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRABZ3nqDkE\" title=\"\">Philipsz, whose <em>Study for Strings</em></a>, a sound piece responding to the history of the Hauptbahnhof, was one of the most affecting works for many visitors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394663418\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2012/8/9/1344527381320/Timeline-by-Susan-Philips-001.jpg\" alt=\"Timeline by Susan Philipsz\" width=\"460\" height=\"475\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Timeline</em>, by Susan Philipsz</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Philipsz confessed that when she made her first site visit to Edinburgh she did not really know the city. As a child growing up in a large Catholic family in Glasgow, she spent little time in Edinburgh, later studying in Belfast and New York and eventually settling in Berlin. She says her inspiration for <a href=\"http://www.edinburghartfestival.com/commissions/susan_philipsz2C_timeline/\" title=\"\"><em>Timeline</em></a>, her Edinburgh work, was the spectacular view spread out below Nelson's Monument, and the tradition of the daily one o'clock gun in Edinburgh Castle, which was originally connected by a mile-long cable to the ball-drop on Cable Hill for sailors at sea to set their chronometers.</p> <p>Philipsz's work will replace the long-removed cable, her sung tripartite chord being taken down the hill through seven individual speakers in a kind of domino effect. The work is a homage to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Robison_(physicist)\" title=\"\">Edinburgh resident John Robinson</a>, who invented the siren, and to the sirens from Homer's <em>Odyssey</em> who lured sailors on to the rocks with the devastating beauty of their sound. Philipsz plays me the chord, simple and pure, which sounds to her, she says, \"somewhat like a train\". Its magic in Edinburgh will be its fleetingness, under a minute in all, and the mystery of where the sound is coming from.</p> <p>Philipsz's sound trajectory will finish near the gun itself, in the gardens beneath the castle, where Edinburgh College of Art graduate <a href=\"http://www.edinburghartfestival.com/events/2012-08-02/\" title=\"\">Emily Speed will stage a one-off performance of <em>Human Castle</em></a>. The work will be composed of 10 \"acro-balancers\" in cardboard costumes, counterbalancing to form a castle-like shape before dismounting. Carey observes that Speed \"draws out fragility in something that we often think of as solid and immovable by making them animate\".</p> <p>This is Speed's first performance back in Edinburgh, having left the city in 2002 to live and work in Japan before settling in Liverpool, and will be the first time she has not taken part. Instead she will assume the role of director: \"It's quite strange to lose control of the work,\" she says. \"It's terrifying but exciting working with the acrobats and I know that people will ask if it is acrobatics or a piece of art.\"</p> <p>She describes the commission as \"an act of faith\", saying Carey \"is not scared to take risks.\" When I speak to Speed she is in the midst of making the costumes. \"I won't know if it works until they do it,\" she says. \"I am asking the acrobats to do something they have never done before: counterbalance.\" There will be only one performance lasting a few minutes, but it will be filmed and screened throughout the festival.</p> <p>In her determination to integrate the programme into the city, Carey identified Rose Street, a short road dominated at one junction by a brutish modernist BHS, as an ideal location for works. <a href=\"http://www.edinburghartfestival.com/commissions/rose_street_film_programme/\" title=\"\">The Rose Street film programme</a> will include Speed's film and will show on small screens in shop windows along the street in daylight, while at night films will be screened on BHS's large external wall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394663419\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2012/8/9/1344512258733/Kevin-Harman-001.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Harman\" width=\"460\" height=\"326\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The artist Kevin Harman Photograph: Stuart Armitt/Edinburgh Art Festival</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart Armitt/Edinburgh Art Festival</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rose Street will also be the location for <a href=\"http://www.edinburghartfestival.com/commissions/kevin_harman/\" title=\"\">Kevin Harman's work <em>24/7</em></a>. Carey first saw the work of Edinburgh native Harman in his degree show. She says his work is \"engaging people about the world and the art, 24/7,\" and her ambitions for the festival as a whole seem to be summed up in the way she describes his piece as a \"facilitation of dialogue\".</p> <p>Harman stole 210 of his neighbours' doormats from three enormous tenement buildings, leaving notes that they could be reclaimed at his degree show, where they were arranged as a giant work of art. The work sought to bring the community together in an unexpected way. Harman says he \"comes to an environment open to the ideas of the viewer\". He chooses not to talk about details of his festival project, saying: \"If I think too much about the project it becomes too contrived.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394663420\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2012/8/9/1344512443705/Anthony-Schrag-001.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Schrag\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Schrag's <em>Wall Standing</em>.

It too will take place on Rose Street and is part of Carey's aim to \"encourage people to broaden their idea of what art can be\". Although Schrag is currently based in the city, he is billed as the Edinburgh \"Tourist in Residence\", reflecting his interest in the changing landscape of his beloved city. He will take small groups around Edinburgh on unusual outings ranging from an early morning walk to a blindfold tour and a communal nap in a park, as well as the Rose Street pub crawl. Although the majority of Schrag's work has been produced outside the gallery context, he does not see himself as a performance artist. He observes that \"unlike in performance art, the viewer takes equal part in the creation of the work\". Rather than the city's beauty spots, his tours will explore the dark alleyways, turning away from the idea that \"art looks at beautiful things\".</p> <p>Of all the artists participating in Festival Promenade, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2aunPHTe_I\" title=\"\">Callum Innes</a>, an Edinburgh resident who shows with a local gallery, could be called the most traditional, with his paintings unashamedly exploring pure abstraction. But for the first time, he works here in light: in his installation<a href=\"http://edinburghfestival.list.co.uk/event/253890-callum-innes-the-regent-bridge/\" title=\"\"> <em>The Regent Bridge</em></a>, two \"paintings\" made of light will change colour with random variations. He says he wanted to \"bring attention and to re-emphasise\" the structure and beauty of the Regent Bridge. \"This is such a dark part of Edinburgh, behind the station, that the changes have to be quick. It's a work of art, not a Georgian project,\" he says firmly. Like many others, Innes felt that the \"festival has always deserved a good visual arts festival\", so he donated his fee and says nervously, as he has not seen the finished work yet, \"it challenged me and works for the city\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394663421\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2012/8/9/1344523799650/Song-Bird-by-John-Bellany-001.jpg\" alt=\"Song Bird by John Bellany\" width=\"460\" height=\"403\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Song Bird</em> by John Bellany, 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Glasgow-based artist <a href=\"http://www.inglebygallery.com/news/andrew-miller-edinburgh-art-festival-pavilion/\" title=\"\">Andrew Miller provides the seeming centre of the installations with <em>The Waiting Place</em></a>, a temporary structure that will provide shelter from the elements, a starting point for Schrag's tours, and information including artist<a href=\"http://www.peterarkle.com/\" title=\"\"> Peter Arkle</a>'s fantastical yet useful map of the festival. Miller has been exploring the interplay between design and art for years. I tell him that his piece seems the most imposing, in a sense, and he laughs. \"It's hard to find \u2013 you have to go off the path and go into the trees, and after the festival it will disappear unless someone comes and decides to buy it and they have both space and a tree to put it round.\" I point out how different this seems from the more grandiose <a href=\"http://www.serpentinegallery.org/architecture/\" title=\"\"><em>Serpentine Pavilions</em></a>. Miller admits that he had a \"quite generous budget, but the structure, while it is temporary, is robust. This is a cross between an <a href=\"http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Aalto_Summer_House.html\" title=\"\">Alvar Aalto summerhouse</a> and a Trinidadian shack.\" <em>The Waiting Place</em> appears to be more of a whimsical summerhouse, and is appropriately named after a line from Dr Seuss: it offers a space \"in which you're welcome to simply enjoy the act of waiting for something to happen\". Miller says \"it will keep you dry, but it is well ventilated deliberately, as it is about looking out. People animate it.\"</p> <p>In Edinburgh, Carey is channelling artists' energy to act outside the cossetted space of the white cube. But if interactive work is not your thing, there are promising shows of <a href=\"http://fruitmarket.co.uk/exhibitions/forward-programme/\" title=\"\">Dieter Roth</a>, <a href=\"http://www.edinburghartfestival.com/exhibitions\" title=\"\">Philip Guston</a>, <a href=\"http://www.scottish-gallery.co.uk/artist/john_bellany/\" title=\"\">John Bellany</a> and the blockbuster<a href=\"http://www.visitmuseums.com/exhibition/picasso-and-modern-british-art-at-national-gallery-1433\" title=\"\"> <em>Picasso and Modern British Art</em></a>, recently at Tate Britain, in Edinburgh museums. For me, though, I imagine Susan Philipsz's haunting sounds will hang in the air long after the festival, encouraging tourists to retrace the mile-long journey of her lost chord.

  "<p>If the Hungary-Ukraine border is the first hurdle of the inaugural Central Asia Rally, we have collided with the top of it and landed on our chins. The Ukrainians are asking for \u20ac10,000 per car to let us through, citing a highly dubious claim about our Hungarian registration plates.</p> <p>The idea behind the rally is simple: buy a load of old bangers in Budapest, drive them east for 18 days and finally sell them again in Dushanbe, capital of Tajikistan. The customs officers, though, aren't impressed by the export plates which are fitted to most of the 10 vehicles taking part. The extraordinary \"deposit\" will get us through this red tape, but there's a sense within the group that in this part of the world corruption is the only thing more widespread than bureaucracy. We aren't going to hand over a cent.</p> <p>Earlier this morning, just as we were about to leave the Hungarian capital, tour coordinator Attila Berenyi gave an impassioned speech to the rally's 30 participants. \"There will be problems,\" he said. \"We will face challenges. But one way or another \u2013 with your car or without it \u2013 you will make it to Dushanbe.\"</p> <p>Now people are cursing his prescience. The rally is managed with \"minimum assistance\" from the organisers \u2013 individual problem-solving is encouraged \u2013 but people didn't expect such calamity so early. The group splits to try to find their own route eastward, agreeing to aim to meet up again in Kazakhstan. A Portuguese team decide to take their chances with officials in Serbia in the hope of getting on their smooth highway. A Hungarian team, driving a 20-year-old Austrian fire truck, persevere with Ukraine but take a route through Moldova, where no one knows anything about Hungarian export plates \u2013 and even if they did, a \u20ac200 backhander eases their passing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394509236\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/8/9/1344511879529/Gorno-Badakhstan-001.jpg\" alt=\"Gorno-Badakhstan\" width=\"460\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cars queued for seven hours at the Gorno-Badakhstan internal border in Tajikistan.

We will drive through Romania and Bulgaria, pass through Turkey along the south coast of the Black Sea, head quickly through Georgia and Russia, north around the Caspian Sea, and finally rejoin the planned route in Kazakhstan. I write those sentences as though I'm spreading soft butter on warm toast, but the result of covering such a distance when we've lost a day yet added 900 miles to our route is some of the most sustained, brutal travelling I've ever done.</p> <p>It takes 27 hours to drive to Istanbul along sluggish Romanian roads and through the darkness of rain-lashed Bulgaria. After five hours of fitful sleep in Istanbul, we follow that with a 29-hour drive to Tbilisi, capital of Georgia, where we manage another four hours in bed. It's far from ideal, but to make up the ground, we must become objects of perpetual motion.</p> <p>In the face of such adversity, camaraderie is essential, and luckily I'm well compensated with my travelling partners. Attila has been suffering for his love of travel for years. In the early 1990s, he went to Egypt with just $150 and managed to string it out for five weeks.</p> <p>\"I was haggling for cigarettes, for third-class train fares,\" he says. \"In the end, I lost 10% of my body weight, but I saw everything I wanted to see.\" The 42-year-old pauses for a second. \"I don't think I could do it again.\"</p> <p>Gabor, meanwhile, lived in Africa on and off for almost a decade. A polyglot, he enjoys the endless complications of language, but he also knows what it's like to sit on a bus without air conditioning for 30 hours. Between us we've been to almost 200 countries, but even with all that travelling experience the amended Central Asia Rally route is an exhausting test. At one point, between Tbilisi and Khiva in Uzbekistan, we drive for 60 hours, only stopping for food and water, napping in shifts when the biting, banging potholes allow.</p> <p>It's not all misery: Turkey's coastal route along the Black Sea is spectacular, as is the drive out of Georgia, through the looming beauty of the Caucasus mountains. Chechnya, on the other side of the Russian border, was never part of the original plan but even redeveloped Grozny \u2013 which, with luxury apartments and a gaudy new mosque, now looks like a mini Dubai \u2013 is strangely attractive.</p> <p>There are low points too, and the nadir is our 22 hours in Russia. Every few miles, corrupt cops flag us down, barking \"<em>registratziya</em>\" through the window, before inventing a series of traffic infractions that can all be waved away for a fee, typically around \u00a36. It's depressing to see these men in uniform, Kalashnikovs slung over their shoulders, essentially saying: \"Spare some change.\" And it's especially galling knowing that we have paid \u00a3125 for a visa to be in their bleak country.</p> <p>We're stopped 10 times, and asked for baksheesh on at least half of these. Speaking Russian or English in those circumstances can be as much of a hindrance as a help. In both languages, these joyless shysters are adept at extortion, but if faced with an unknown language, like Hungarian, or rapid lowland Scots (\"Ah'm scunnered wae this pish, ya bawbag\") they sometimes decide we're more hassle than we're worth.</p> <p>Yet making yourself indecipherable is contrary to the spirit of the rest of the rally. While Russian is spoken in most of the countries we visit, the majority of teams don't know any, so everything from car repairs to finding a guesthouse is achieved through games of charades. Handily, a permanent layer of scum on the vehicles provides a dirty slate on which to draw diagrams and write numbers.</p> <p>The rally is a test of the participants' luck, patience and endurance, and for the first week ours are respectively nonexistent, frayed and kaput. Others have similar travails as they swap Europe for Asia, including a couple of minor crashes and several breakdowns. In their own ways, each border crossing is a squalid nightmare \u2013 a man with a gun can be intimidating, but a man with a rubber stamp really has you by the balls. At one point, Gabor hands over a \u20ac2.50 bottle of \"Hungarian champagne\" to a Kazakh guard who is trying to delay us. \"He thinks he's won,\" says my co-driver, \"but he hasn't tasted that stuff yet.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394509237\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/8/9/1344512037912/Samarkands-Registan-001.jpg\" alt=\"Samarkand's Registan\" width=\"460\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samarkand's Registan square.

Every night, our hotels and guesthouses are full of drivers regaling others with tales of their bizarre days in these little-visited parts of the world. Good or bad, everything becomes a story.</p> <p>Mercifully, things start to slow down a little when we get to strange, sprawling Uzbekistan. Its currency, the som, doesn't carry much value \u2013 1,000 som is the biggest note in circulation, but it's only worth about 35p, so to walk around with a tenner is to feel like a Vegas high-roller. Bribing officials here would look genuinely impressive given the fat wedges of money that would change hands, but to their unending credit, over the four days we're in their country the Uzbeks never ask for a thing. Not even when we deserve a fine.</p> <p>One day I ride in car six, with Miguel Almas and Miguel Esteves from Portugal. In another world they are a vet and a psychiatrist; in this one they're a pair of hard-drinking, hard-driving (though not always at the same time) desperados on a mission to experience everything they possibly can and to have a bloody good laugh while doing so. Their motto \"Why not?\" is perplexingly difficult to contradict, even when I really want to. Our drive in their red, 20-year-old VW Passat estate (185,000 miles on the clock) is supposed to be simple, but a few deliberate wrong turns, and a bit of off-roading later (\"Why not?\") we find ourselves detained by the Uzbek military. After an hour of shared confusion, they send us on our way, but even though we are clearly in the wrong \u2013 we strayed into a military zone \u2013 they never hint at a bribe.</p> <p>The Central Asia Rally is in its infancy, but it approximately follows the ancient silk route, through Uzbekistan's market towns of Khiva, Bukhara and Samarkand, up into the mountains of Tajikistan. We spend a week in this lofty little nation, which also borders Afghanistan. Many of the teams plan to make an excursion there but I opt out. With my British passport, I feel that by essentially holidaying there, I'd be on a Venn diagram comprising the cruise ship passengers who frolicked on Haitian beaches immediately after the 2010 earthquake, and a marine posing over an Afghan corpse. I'd be between those two, on an intersection marked wanker.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394509238\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/8/9/1344511961813/Tajikistan-mountains-001.jpg\" alt=\"Tajikistan mountains\" width=\"460\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The beautiful mountain landscape of Tajikistan.

Snow-capped peaks, glaciers, ravines, gorges, turquoise lakes, geysers, hot springs, waterfalls, snow leopards, bears, the endangered Marco Polo sheep \u2026 Tajikistan has it all, except for other tourists. When we drive over the 3,200m-high summer route from Tavildara to Khorog we don't see another vehicle for two hours. The people are warm and welcoming, and a great many of them have the same intense green eyes as National Geographic poster-girl <a href=\"http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2002/04/afghan-girl/index-text\" title=\"\">Sharbat Gula</a>.</p> <p>Scrabbling around in these mountains presents more challenges for our old bangers: at one point four vehicles have to form a chain with tow ropes to get our increasingly useless Nissan out of a river. Yet, somehow, we all make it through the Pamir mountains, over the 4,272m Koi-Tezek pass, and all the way to Murghob, just 30 miles from the Chinese border. Out here in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province (GBAO), the people have been largely abandoned by their government. A separate ethnic group, the Pamiris picked the losing rebel side during Tajikistan's bloody civil war in the 1990s, and the army were not gracious in victory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394509239\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/8/9/1344531133155/Towed-out-001.jpg\" alt=\"Towed out\" width=\"460\" height=\"148\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vehicles line up to pull the Nissan out of a river in Tajikistan. Photograph: Jamie Lafferty</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie Lafferty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a result, Murghob has minimal electricity (from solar panels and generators) and gets its water from wells. There is a constant smell of burning. A handful of determined NGOs struggle against the odds to keep the town afloat, and they need all the help they can get. The rally teams do what they can by donating wheelchairs, clothes and stationery, which we have brought over 5,200 miles from Budapest and beyond.</p> <p>Murghob is as far east as we will go \u2013 from here it's three days' drive back to Dushanbe, hugging the Afghan border along a bucking dusty road. After 200 hours of driving, it proves too much for our Nissan, which gives out on a mountain pass at 1am when something vital pops in the engine. After much fretting and failed attempts at towing, we decide to abandon it and give the keys to a local in Dushanbe.</p> <p>Thankfully the Miguels are on hand to give us a lift to the nearest town, from where we take a 10-hour taxi ride to the capital. That the Portuguese are there at all is extremely fortunate. Only two hours previously, in one of the most surreal moments of the rally, a mechanic offered them a bag of rubies for their beaten-up Passat, despite the fact that both its bumpers have been shorn off and the windscreen is cracked. Even if the jewels had really been glass, they would probably have made a profit, but with 400 miles still to go they had to decline.</p> <p>When we finally get to the end, a hairy viaduct of raised eyebrows greets me as I limp into the perfumed lobby of the Hyatt Regency in Dushanbe dusty and deranged, my filthy hair set hard like a rubbish action figure. I try to ignore their dismay, check in and just sleep, sleep, sleep.</p> <p>The rally has been incredibly hard work, almost three weeks of unending challenges and no small amount of anguish in pursuit of adventure. It represents a much more old-fashioned, organic kind of travel: wandering off with only a vague plan and taking your chances with the great unknown.</p> <p>\"Of course it's tough,\" laughed Gabor during one 10-hour stretch along an annihilated Uzbek highway. \"We just didn't say exactly how tough.\"</p> <p><strong>Follow Jamie on Twitter </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MegaHeid\" title=\"\"><strong>@megaheid</strong></a></p>",
  "<p>Wandering along the narrow, twisting streets of the tiny south Devon village of Shaldon, past the bowling green and rows of thatched cottages and listed Georgian homes, you wouldn't bat an eyelid if a horse-drawn carriage rolled past, or a lady swept by in Georgian dress. It seems to be the seaside village that time forgot, almost.</p> <p>For nearly 200 years, residents have gathered every August on the pocket-sized red sandy beach for the annual regatta, while the distinctive black and white boat, which shuttles people across to the town of Teignmouth on the other side of the estuary, is Britain's oldest passenger ferry, dating from Saxon times. Guarding this community from the sea is the Ness, Shaldon's towering headland and cliff face, through which runs a smugglers' tunnel to a hidden beach.</p> <p>But times are changing, thanks in part to one man who seems to have begun something of a gentle revolution. Tim Bouget, a Michel Roux-trained chef who was born in the region, returned in 2006 from world travels to find a handsome Georgian building for sale in narrow Fore Street. He and wife Clare bought and renovated the building, and opened it as a restaurant, named \"<a href=\"http://odetruefood.com/\" title=\"ODE Shaldon\">ODE</a>\" \u2013 after the building's postcode. This year the cosy rustic restaurant features in the pages of a number of esteemed food publications, including the Michelin Guide, and the Good Food Guide. It even beat Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's River Cottage to bag the <a href=\"http://www.thesra.org/some-good-thing/sustainable-restaurant-awards/\" title=\"Sustainable Restaurant of the Year 2012 awards\">Sustainable Restaurant of the Year 2012 award</a>, and is now the country's highest-rated sustainable restaurant. Local residents may have been a little suspicious of a chef who has plied his trade at a Michelin-starred restaurant in London's Park Lane opening for business in sleepy Shaldon, but most have come round.</p> <p>Bouget recalls the time he and Clare forgot to lock the door of the restaurant before going out for the day. \"When we came back there was a list of names, times and phone numbers on a piece of paper. People had come in, made their own reservations and left.\"</p> <p>I have eaten there and I am not in the least surprised that even the law-abiding people of Shaldon would risk arrest to secure a table.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394571316\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/8/9/1344532641211/New-beach-huts-in-Shaldon-001.jpg\" alt=\"New beach huts in Shaldon\" width=\"460\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New beach huts in Shaldon.

Last year the tired beach-front chandlery which had been peddling buckets, spades and crab lines for years was transformed \u2013 not without some local resistance \u2013 into five splendid beach huts that spill on to the sand. (One is currently for sale at \u00a3220,000). Next door is <a href=\"http://www.theclippershaldon.co.uk/\" title=\"The Clipper\">The Clipper</a>, a former beach-front cafe that was refurbished, extended and reopened in April 2012 as a stylish cafe run by two Italian chefs, who grow many of their own vegetables on a farm a mile away, while bread comes from the Shaldon Bakery, a craft bakery just down the road, which opened in 2009.</p> <p>Further along The Strand, where a narrow road separates the beach from the handful of pubs and guesthouses, is <a href=\"http://www.numberonethestrand.co.uk/\" title=\"Number One\">Number One</a>. When I visited last year this was the charming but jaded Beachcomber Caf\u00e9, as it had been for 20 years. Now it is a contemporary space with a centrepiece bar lined with Champagne bottles, a tapas menu and an emphasis on local suppliers, not least locally caught fish.</p> <p>This summer has also seen a number of new shops opening. In June, Chicy Rachael's homeware and gift shop appeared, selling beautiful wooden bowls turned by Rachael's father, a joiner in Teignmouth, across the estuary. Two weeks ago The Yummy Shop was born \u2013 a deli with wares including gluten-free Devon farm ice cream and organic farm eggs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394571317\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/8/9/1344532741841/Organic-treats-at-cafe-OD-001.jpg\" alt=\"Organic treats at cafe ODE\" width=\"460\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Organic treats at cafe ODE</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Walk up the hill towards the Ness \u2013 past the Ness House Hotel, a striking Georgian building that is now a restaurant and bar with rooms \u2013 and you will find Bouget's latest venture, \"cafe ODE\", which opened in May in a converted stable on the hillside overlooking the river Teign. Motivated by the birth of the couple's daughter, Thula, the cafe serves affordable family food with a sustainable heart, from organic farm ice cream to a good portion of locally sourced fish and chips for \u00a38.50. True to Bouget's passion, the building is constructed from locally quarried stone and powered by renewable energy sources, while the benches are made from reclaimed materials and the menu boards were salvaged from a skip. Bouget even regularly ventures through the nearby smugglers' tunnel to forage for sea lettuce and rock samphire at the \"secret\" beach.</p> <p>Shaldon's salty sea air remains rich with history, but it is edging into the present in a fittingly charming way.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>For more information go to <a href=\"http://shaldon-village.co.uk/\" title=\"Shaldon village\">shaldon-village.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Time magazine and CNN both suspended journalist Fareed Zakaria on Friday after he was caught plagiarising from the New Yorker in the latest scandal to hit the world of American journalism.</p> <p>Zakaria, who writes columns for Time and hosts a CNN television show, had written an article for the magazine on the issue of gun control following the recent mass shootings in Colorado. A short version also appeared as a blog post on CNN's website.</p> <p>However, several blogs, such as conservative <a href=\"http://newsbusters.org/blogs/tim-graham/2012/08/10/talk-about-concealed-carry-fareed-zakaria-plagiarized-paragraph-history-\">media watchdog Newsbusters</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/313643/did-zakaria-borrow-ithe-new-yorkeri-robert-verbruggen\">the National Review online</a>, spotted similarities between parts of Zakaria's column and a piece on the same topic in an April issue of the The New Yorker.</p> <p>The paragraphs in question largely involved descriptions of historical events and context about gun control in America and do not seem anywhere near as serious as other famed plagiarists \u2013 such as Jayson Blair at the New York Times and Stephen Glass at the New Republic who made up entire quotes, people and incidents.</p> <p>But as media websites picked up the story and asked Time for an official comment, Zakaria issued a statement and confessed to his error.</p> <p>\"Media reporters have pointed out that paragraphs in my Time column this week bear close similarities to paragraphs in Jill Lepore's essay in the April 23rd issue of The New Yorker. They are right. I made a terrible mistake. It is a serious lapse and one that is entirely my fault. I apologize unreservedly to her, to my editors at Time, and to my readers,\" Zakaria said.</p> <p>Time then announced it was suspending the writer for a month and possibly longer.</p> <p>\"Time accepts Fareed's apology, but what he did violates our own standards for our columnists, which is that their work must not only be factual but original; their views must not only be their own but their words as well. As a result, we are suspending Fareed's column for a month, pending further review,\" said a statement by Time spokeswoman Ali Zelenko.</p> <p>CNN also suspended Zakaria and did not put a time limit on it. \"We have reviewed Fareed Zakaria's TIME column, for which he has apologized. He wrote a shorter blog post on CNN.com on the same issue which included similar unattributed excerpts. That blog post has been removed and CNN has suspended Fareed Zakaria while this matter is under review,\" the broadcaster said in a statement.</p> <p>Indian-born Zakaria is one of the most familiar faces in American journalism. Before he joined Time he was a longstanding Newsweek writer, and he is also the host of the CNN show Fareed Zakaria GPS, which focuses on international issues. He has also written numerous books.</p> <p>It is not the first time that Zakaria has been accused of falling below what is accepted in the world of journalism.</p> <p>In 2009, Jeffrey Goldberg, a national correspondent for The Atlantic, claimed the then Newsweek columnist stole a quote of his for a cover story on Iran.</p> <p>In a blogpost \u2013 which has been widely recirculated since Friday's revelations - Goldberg alleged that Zakaria tried to pass off part of an interview with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as his own work.</p> <p>\"Are there any good quotes from Zakaria interviews with world leaders that I could lift for the Atlantic?\" Goldberg asked.</p> <p>The plagiarism incident that led to Zakaria's suspension is merely the latest in a long line of acts of plagiarism that have been spotted at all levels of American journalism.</p> <p>The New Yorker itself was recently involved in a scandal after one of its newest hires, popular science writer Jonah Lehrer, \"self-plagiarised\" from some of his own earlier columns.</p> <p>Lehrer survived that moment and kept his job but it was later revealed he had also made up some Bob Dylan quotes for his latest book. That title \u2013 Imagine \u2013 was then withdrawn from sale by his publisher and he was sacked from the New Yorker.</p> <p>Lehrer joins a list of journalists who have fallen short of accepted good practice of late. Earlier this week Nevada Appeal columnist Bob Thomas was exposed for having apparently copied large parts of a widely circulated and 13-year-old internet essay on America's Founding Fathers and passed it off as his own column.</p> <p>Last month the New Canaan News in Connecticut sacked reporter Paresh Jha for fabricating quotes and making up interviews in at least 25 different stories. In June the Wall Street Journal fired intern Liane Membis after it was discovered that she had also made up names and quotes for an article about the re-opening of a bridge in New York.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Saturday 11 August </strong></p> <p>Golds up for grabs <strong>30</strong></p> <p>A colossal day of competition at the Games, with compelling finals including five boxing contests, canoe sprints and the women's 800m final.

After last Saturday's gold, Mo Farah steps into the stadium once again for the 5,000m final.</p> <p>The sheer momentousness of Farah's 10,000m victory in a race ruled by the Kenyans and Ethiopians for decades may have been slightly underplayed with all of Britain's golden glory last weekend but a win in the 5,000m would surely make Farah the most impressive golden boy of 2012. His pace will suit the shorter distance but it is a tough psychological and physical challenge to compete again so soon after his last gruelling triumph. And Kenenisa Bekele, the Ethiopian world champion and reigning Olympic champ in the 5,000m, will be out for revenge after he was blown away in the final lap last weekend. <em>Men's 5,000m final, 7.30pm</em></p> <h2>Grudge match </h2> <p>If the USA and Jamaica aren't locked in a fuming, spitting, strutting grudge after these Games then their athletes need a sports psychologist to check that they actually have a competitive streak. The 4x100m is perfect territory for Justin Gaitlin and Tyson Gay to erase the hurt of the 100m. Bolt and his little buddy, Yohan Blake, will have nothing to prove but will still want to grab some golden glory, and more bragging rights over the Americans. <em>Men's 4x100m relay final, 9pm</em></p> <h2>Brits to watch</h2> <p>Can Tom Daley do it? Less feted Brits also have a good medal chance today. Liam Heath and Jon Schofield have won three European titles in a row in the K2 200m canoe sprint championships.

  "<p>For more than a decade, we have been told that the pharmaceutical industry faces a crisis: it finds it more and more difficult to develop new drugs. The returns on research and development, company executives plead, are dismal. In the US particularly they have therefore lobbied for longer periods of patent protection, more government subsidies and less regulation of new drugs. The growing costs of research, they argue, justify the high prices. But this week a widely reported paper for the British Medical Journal, by two North American professors, <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/phillypharma/Researchers-say-pharmaceutical-innovation-crisis-is-a-myth.html\" title=\"\">Donald Light and Joel Lexchin</a>, points out that the annual licensing of new drugs is much the same as it has been for 50 years. Unfortunately, 85-90% are minor variations on existing drugs (often introduced when patents are near expiry) and provide \"few or no clinical advantages for patients\".</p> <p>The US drugs industry, say Light and Lexchin, spends only 1.3% of revenues (excluding taxpayer subsidies) on basic research to discover molecules that could lead to genuinely new medicines. It spends far more on maintaining profits \u2013 among the highest of any industry, after tax \u2013 and on PR, marketing and lobbying. There is an innovation crisis, but largely of the companies' own making.</p> <p>For years nearly all original drugs brought to market have been based on research either at taxpayer-funded institutions, mainly universities, or in small biotechnology companies. Big companies, such as Pfizer and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/03/glaxosmithkline-fined-bribing-doctors-pharmaceuticals\" title=\"\">GlaxoSmithKline (recently fined $3bn</a> by US regulators for aggressive and misleading marketing), are essentially rent-seekers. They do not create wealth and add social benefit, but enrich themselves through control of resources, as landowners have done for generations. And what has happened in \"big pharma\" \u2013 long marked down by the left, and some on the right, as an unacceptable face of capitalism \u2013 mirrors what has happened across the British and US economies. The innovation crisis is not confined to the drugs industry.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xn3ttl_paypal-co-founders-peter-thiel-and-max-levchin-on-the-death-of-innovation_lifestyle\" title=\"\">Max Levchin and Peter Thiel, co-founders of PayPal, said last year that innovation in the US was \"somewhere between dire straits and dead\"</a>. In his book R<a href=\"http://www.creativeclass.com/richard_florida/books/the_rise_of_the_creative_class\" title=\"\">ise of the Creative Class (2002), Richard Florida</a> of Toronto University argued that, while a time traveller from 1900 arriving in 1950 would be astonished by phones, planes, cars, electricity, fridges, radio, TV, penicillin and so on, a traveller from 1950 to the present would find little to amaze beyond the internet, PCs, mobile phones and, perhaps, how old technologies had become infinitely more reliable. The US economist Tyler Cowen made a similar point last year in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/feb/13/will-hutton-innovation-must-be-encouraged\" title=\"\">The Great Stagnation</a>: innovation slowed after the 1970s, he argued, and failed to create jobs. No development of the past 50 years, he could have added, bestowed benefits comparable to what washing machines and vacuum cleaners did to liberate women from drudgery.</p> <p>Green energy technologies have not developed for large-scale use as was widely expected. Nor have electric cars, still less flying cars. The promise of gene therapy is unfulfilled. The development of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microelectromechanical_systems\" title=\"\">MEMs</a> (miniaturised pumps, levers or sensors on silicon chips) and nanotechnology \u2013 predicted as long ago as 1959 \u2013 has been agonisingly slow. In some respects, we have gone backwards: since the retirement of Concorde, the speed of air travel has slowed.</p> <p>The desirability of some of these technologies is contested, but their spread has not been inhibited on social or ethical grounds. So what stops their development? Excessive government regulation and high taxes, stifling animal spirits among innovators and entrepreneurs, are commonly blamed. I see it differently. Invention and development of genuinely new, beneficial products are being stifled, as in the pharmaceutical industry, by big, established companies, not government. Just as drug companies tweak existing products, and deploy large marketing budgets to present them as new, so do other companies tweak and sometimes incrementally improve technologies that were familiar to our grandparents.</p> <p>Supermarkets are full of things that claim to be \"new and improved\". Technologists tweak vegetables and fruits to make them last longer, look better and travel more easily, without regard to flavour. Bankers develop new trading \"products\" that, however you cut it, are still about borrowing and lending. We have digital radio and high-definition TV, though not everybody thinks either improves on what existed before. For many companies, skilful marketing of products that aren't significantly different from what preceded them has replaced innovation. It's cheaper and less risky to convince customers that something is ground-breaking, even when it isn't, than develop something truly innovatory.</p> <p>In short, rent-seeking is now far more lucrative than innovation that delivers social benefits. The big rewards go to directors and executives of large companies \u2013 and financial traders, the ultimate rent-seekers who impose an unproductive tax on invention, investment and hard work across the world. Like the inventors of lasers and transistors, Alan Turing \u2013 without whom the modern computer wouldn't exist \u2013 and Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the worldwide web, did not become rich. Bill Gates and the late Steve Jobs did.</p> <p>Gates and Jobs recognised the possibilities of what others invented, risked money to develop them, and through marketing and design made them accessible to millions. Nobody suggests they should go unrewarded. But as Joseph Stiglitz points out in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/13/price-inequality-joseph-stiglitz-review\" title=\"\">The Price of Inequality</a>, Microsoft \"did not develop the first widely used word processor, the first spreadsheet, the first browser, the first media player, or the first dominant search engine\". Gates became rich because he established a near-monopoly in PC operating systems. When innovations such as the web browser appeared, he saw off their initial developers and other potential competitors by launching his own versions at below-cost prices or none at all.</p> <p>Innovation always entails risk. But the bar is set higher because those who innovate or support innovation must overcome the entrenched interests of monopolistic rent-seekers, who usually have the ear of governments and regulators. Knowing this, many scientists and mathematicians put their innovatory talents at the well-rewarded service of financial companies rather than struggle in research labs. Light and Lexchin argue for better regulation of the drugs industry. We need better regulation of rent-seekers across the board if the British and US economies are to be steered towards creating genuinely new, marketable technologies that are both job-creating and socially beneficial.</p>",
  "<p>With A-level results out in England and Wales this week, thoughts will turn to the future, amid gloomy news of large student debts and graduate unemployment. A year after their own A-level results, Zak Antrobus, 19, who has just completed his first year at university, and Jasmine Cope, 17, who joined a school-leavers' training scheme, discuss whether going to university is worth it. Emine Saner listens in.</p> <p><strong>Jasmine Cope:</strong> I didn't apply for university. I went into a training scheme with PriceWaterhouseCoopers. I've worked for a year with full pay and lots of training. It's just as good an experience as university. I've met lots of new people and got to work in a new environment.</p> <p><strong>Zak Antrobus:</strong> I chose to go to university. All my friends planned to go so I thought I should try to get in, and it would open up more opportunities for me. I'm in my first year of economics and finance. In the long term, I thought there would be more jobs available if I have a degree. I prefer the idea of learning for a little longer, going on a placement for a year, finishing my degree and possibly getting a job at the placement.</p> <p><strong>JC:</strong> I work in tax, and they are putting me through the ATT, the Association of Tax Technicians qualification. From my point of view, a degree would be unnecessary because you would need that professional qualification anyway. I thought it was good to go straight in and get experience, on full pay. I'm not getting into debt and they are covering my training fees. There was so much pressure to go to university at my school. A few years ago, university wasn't always expected for everyone, but now it is.</p> <p><strong>ZA: </strong>I wasn't that bothered about the debt. I managed to get in on the lower fees before they increased, so there was more of an incentive to go that year, but going to university is an investment that will go towards paying off those debts.</p> <p><strong>JC:</strong> What about people who don't get a&#xa0;job at the end of it?</p> <p><strong>ZA: </strong>Eventually they will. I won't have to pay back my finance until I earn over a&#xa0;certain amount. It probably should worry me, but it doesn't.</p> <p><strong>JC:</strong> I thought, because unemployment is so high and particularly for under 25s, I should start looking for a job now rather than hope the economy will have picked up in four years. I thought it was best to go in and get experience because you can have qualifications, but if you don't have experience, it doesn't look good.</p> <p><strong>ZA: </strong>That is something I worry about. I&#xa0;have quite a few qualifications, but not&#xa0;really any experience. I feel that is something that will hold me back later.</p> <p><strong>JC:</strong> That's hard for everyone \u2013 people are taking on interns and not paying them. I&#xa0;thought I might as well be working full time, rather than trying to get internships during summer breaks.</p> <p><strong>ZA: </strong>I hope things will be better by the time I graduate. If they're not, I'm not sure what I'll do. Among the people I&#xa0;know, it doesn't really bother them. They don't say \"we're at university now but when we leave we won't be able to find a job\". It's more about living now and knowing you have to get good grades. I know I need to get at least a&#xa0;2:1&#xa0;to get a good placement.</p> <p><strong>JC:</strong> Of the people I know who went to university, some have picked a degree that will get them a career, like medicine or vet science, or they're just going for the experience, and it doesn't matter that they'll come out with debt. That's great for them, but I thought it was a luxury. I think some people seem to be pretending unemployment isn't happening, or it's in the future and they're not going to think about it. University is meant to be fun, and people say you make loads of friends, but I have fun and meet people who aren't my own age. People seem to think if you're in a full-time job, you're chained to a desk and not allowed to talk to anyone.</p> <p><strong>Emine Saner:</strong> Is there a hierarchy between graduates and non-graduates at your job?</p> <p><strong>JC:</strong> Not at all. Maybe when graduates first come in they realise they're at the same level as us. I wouldn't say it's a snobbery, more a realisation. You don't need to have a degree to be a manager or a partner, there are no barriers, but I see there can be in other jobs.</p> <p><strong>ZA: </strong>Having a degree might not be needed but I think it can look better. After my A-levels I wasn't sure what I&#xa0;wanted to do for a job. This has given me another few years to think about it. I&#xa0;chose to go to uni for the degree, but I&#xa0;have enjoyed meeting new people and making friends. It's a great experience. I&#xa0;have been living with 11 others and there is no one else in my flat doing my course \u2013 we've got people doing English, engineering, law. It's really good for me, it's boosted my confidence.</p> <p><strong>JC:</strong> My friends are from small towns and they've met people at uni from different backgrounds. I can see how that is good.</p> <p><strong>ES: </strong>Have you felt left out by not going?</p> <p><strong>JC:</strong> I might call them and say I'm knackered from work and they'll say, \"Can I talk to you later? I'm just about to go out for the fourth time this week.\" There is that aspect that none of them have done what I've done. But I've also moved out of home, I'm living with new people. I&#xa0;don't think that's necessarily the university experience, it's just growing up. University forces you to go away from home and learn things like how to cook and meet new people, but if you're motivated you can do that without uni.</p> <p><strong>ZA: </strong>If I didn't go to university I would probably still be living at home. For a lot of people, going to uni helps them become more independent.</p> <p><strong>ES: </strong>By the time you're in your mid-20s, you will have been working for nearly 10 years. Do you think then that you might regret not going to university?</p> <p><strong>JC:</strong> At some point I will take six months out and travel, or live somewhere else. Once I've been working for 10 years, and hopefully in the same company, you can ask for a career break. People think you have to have a gap year when you're 18 and cram everything in \u2013 \"this is my time to be free before I grow up\" \u2013 but you can do that at another time. There is such a focus on university. There was so much information [at my school] on how to write a good personal statement for a Ucas application, but there was nothing on how to write a really good CV or fill in a job application.</p> <p><strong>ZA: </strong>At my school they wanted you to go to university. They didn't force people, but they would talk about it a lot. I am the first person in my family to go, and they were happy about it. They weren't worried about the money. They were just happy for me to do what I wanted.</p> <p><strong>JC:</strong> I was talking to someone on my training course about something I had read about how people meet their partners at university. She said, \"Do you know what that means?\" and we were both like, \"Oh.\" People say, \"my old uni friends\" and I'll have to say \"my old work friends\". But I would choose to do&#xa0;the same again. If there were other variables \u2013 if it was free to go and I could get into a good university, I would have considered it, but I think what I have done is the best for me, and for where the economy is, right now.</p>",
  "<p>Throughout the week, news junkies like yourself are weighted with information the way the women of the US Olympic team are weighted with medals. But what is any of that worth? An Olympic medal can fetch up to $15,000 (US swimmer and eccentric hottie Anthony Ervin gave the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/sports/olympics/anthony-ervin-olympic-medalist-in-2000-comes-back-in-swimming.html?pagewanted=all\">proceeds of that sale</a> to victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami), but, as with political stories, most of the value invested in a medal is purely <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/story?id=100405&amp;page=1#.UCVKH2MsjGI\">sentimental</a>. This week, a brief look at a couple of stories you know about \u2013 and what they really mean. (PS Romney show horse Rafalca came in 30th. <em>Fact</em>.)</p> <p><strong>When did you stop killing that man's wife?</strong> By now, if you're the kind of person who's reading this article, you're probably one of the <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/10/already-viewed-by-scores-criticized-super-pac-ad-has-yet-to-air-as-paid-commercial/\">half-million</a> people who've seen the controversial Priorities USA ad featuring a man laid-off from his job after Bain Capital took over the company. The Obama Super Pac has yet to pay anyone to air the ad, but it is by far the most-talked about piece of campaign propaganda this season.</p> <p>You probably also know why that is: building upon the Obama campaign's most successful lines of attack \u2013 linking Romney to Bain to people losing their jobs \u2013 the spot adds at least one other loop of logic to the chain, joining Romney to Bain to job loss to cancer to death. </p> <p>The Romney team has been trying to point out that the trail of facts that connect Mitt Romney and steelworker Joe Soptic's tragic story are more complex and less concrete than the Obama ad implies. They're not wrong. In 993, Bain bought a steel mill in Kansas (adds Romney: he wasn't running Bain at the time!). Soptic became unemployed (Romney: he was offered a buy-out!). Soptic lost his health insurance; his wife lost her health insurance (years after Soptic lost his job!). She was diagnosed with cancer (far into the disease's progress); and then, yes, she died. The Romney camp has a point, but the Obama ad is ingeniously devious beyond a mere twist of facts \u2013 indeed, it's downright Rovian. Romney may be running a repeat of McCain's 2008 campaign, but the Obama team is channelling Bush's in 2004.</p> <p>There's the obvious: as far as political knife-fights go, once you start arguing about whether or not your candidate killed a man's wife, <em>you're already losing</em>. Then there's the way that debating the details of Soptic's story has kept Romney and his surrogates from hammering Obama on the economy.</p> <p>The sheer audacity of the ad has also forced the Republicans to resort to one of the least attractive tactics available: whining about what's fair. Americans don't like dirty politics and negative ads, it's true, but it can hardly sit well with the Republican base that Romney now wants to hand over control of the debate to the mainstream media, complaining to one <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/243029-team-romney-pressures-obama-to-denounce-controversial-cancer-ad\">interviewer</a> that \"the various fact-checkers look at some of these charges in the Obama ads and they say that they're wrong, and inaccurate, and yet he just keeps on running them.\"</p> <p>Yes, by all means, let's make campaigns pull every ad deemed inaccurate by journalists! Neither side would have many left. </p> <p>What's more, Romney campaign helped the Obama cause along by at first underscoring their point: given <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2009/09/dying-from-lack-of-insurance/\">how many Americans die every year because they don't have cover (45,000)</a>, it's important to have health insurance! So important, in fact, that some states <em>mandate</em> it. The inappropriateness of Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul reminding reporters that Mrs Soptic <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79482.html#.UCKQfD_Xpmg.twitter\">would have had insurance</a> if she'd lived in Massachusetts made some analysts wonder if the whole ad was some kind of trap wandered into by an increasingly rudderless campaign.</p> <p>No less than noted authority on <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/12/07/halperin_elizabeth_edwards_hardball/\">bedside manner</a> Mark Halperin has said that the \"cancer ad\" oversteps some invisible line in <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/2012/08/08/why-the-obama-super-pac-ad-is-different/\">political etiquette</a>, though I have no doubt that should Obama win (ads are only in bad taste if the candidate loses), the line will simply move. Should journalists take a stand on whether an ad \"goes too far\"? Is \"who will kill more people\" a useful metric for deciding one's vote? Should how they die matter? (Uninsured getting sick versus execution by armed drone?) I have no answers to these questions, which is apparently just fine because that's not the debate we're having.</p> <p><strong>These are not the vice-presidential candidates you're looking for.</strong> A further question: stopping the media from speculating on veep selections \u2013 is there an app for that? The only good thing about reporters tossing out names of possible vice-presidential candidates is that you can't accuse them of needing to do more reporting on it. It is functionally impossible to report on who Romney will pick to fill out the ballot because VP choices are one of the few modern political decisions that are truly personal. Polling data and focus groups play a role, but in the end, the nominee has to go with the person who feels right. As much as analysts say that carrying a home state matters, \"regional balance\" hasn't been a factor since the last civil war veterans died off. Thus, I've been arguing that the most important thing Romney's pick will tell us is what Romney thinks about himself. Call it an X-ray of the soul, though I suspect Romney's might be more an X-ray for a soul. </p> <p>If anything, the most chattered-about names \u2013 Paul Ryan, Tim Pawlenty, and Rob Portman \u2013 probably have less of a chance than they did before we started talking about them. Having a high public profile is pretty much a negative. On Friday, Romney spokesperson Eric Fernstrom told reporters asking about the process to \"download the app\". My gut feeling is that in Romney's perfect world, the VP would <em>be</em> the app.</p> <p><strong>And now for something completely different.</strong> American Conservative senior editor Rod Dreher, author of Crunchy Cons: How Birkenstocked Burkeans [\u2026], drew my attention to a <a href=\"http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/i-miss-the-old-left-at-prayer/\">story</a> that's gotten very little attention outside Catholic circles, but is an interesting counterweight to the <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/08/10/672391/catholic-nuns-send-letter-to-romney-challenging-his-woeful-lack-of-knowledge-about-the-poor/\">media coverage of the band of nuns protesting</a> Romney's policy regarding the poor \u2013 and speaks to the future of the Catholic political tradition in the US.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"For the first time since the Vatican announced a crackdown on the organization, the Leadership Conference of Women Religious \u2013 the umbrella group that represents 80% of America's Roman Catholic nuns \u2013 met for its annual conference. For an organization under fire from Rome for its alleged theological heterodoxy, LCWR's choice of a keynote speaker was unusual: Barbara Marx Hubbard, an elderly New Age guru whose vacuous nostrums bring to mind a nitrous oxide aficionado who just rollerbladed in from the Venice boardwalk. Hubbard called the nuns 'the best seedbed I know for evolving the Church and the world in the 21st century'. Good luck with that.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Dreher contrasts the \"narcissism\" of the nuns' religiosity with the religious liberalism from generations past. Reflecting on LCWR's decline, he writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The problem with today's religious liberalism is that it privileges individual desire and individual experience so radically that it gives away any solid ground from which it might stand to move the world and to change it. For that matter, how in the world are these nuns going to be the seedbed for any kind of change when they can't even convince anyone to join their own ranks?</p> <p>\"US membership in Catholic women's religious orders continues to <a href=\"http://ncronline.org/news/women-religious/studies-chart-diminishment-us-sisters-numbers\">plummet</a>: 90% of American nuns are aged 60 or older, and only 5% are under the age of 50. Perhaps Marx Hubbard expects that desiccated seedbed to grow magic beanstalks. In any case, the LCWR conference at least somewhat gainsays the popular narrative that the American nuns are innocent victims of a Vatican Inquisition seeking to impose rigid doctrinal orthodoxy on kindly old ladies who only want to serve the poor.\"</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>There is a scene in A Coat of Varnish, the ponderous last novel by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._P._Snow\" title=\"\">scientist-writer CP Snow</a>, where a bar in a posh London club is wrecked by vandals. Last August, diners at the Ledbury, in the plush London enclave of Notting Hill, must have felt an uncomfortable parallel when rioters invaded the Michelin-starred restaurant, a crime for which they received <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/08/rioters-notting-hill-ledbury-jailed\" title=\"\">heavy sentences</a> earlier this week: the slender margin between order and disorder \u2013 Snow's coat of varnish \u2013 had been dissolved. Twelve months on, the transformation of last year's festival of lawlessness into this year's festival of sport has been so complete it would be easy to suppose that August 2011 was a fleeting aberration, nothing more than a bad dream. Easy, but mistaken.</p> <p>As far as David Cameron was concerned, the riots were about lawlessness and greed, stoked by a tiny group of dysfunctional families, a society with an overdeveloped sense of entitlement and a gang culture that recognised no boundaries. It was all of a piece with his election narrative: people took to the streets because Britain was broken. There was no purpose in a formal inquiry: there were no institutional grievances demanding a response. It is to Nick Clegg's credit that he won a partial inquiry, the <a href=\"http://riotspanel.independent.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Riots Communities and Victims Panel</a>, which found a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/28/verdict-uk-riots-stake-society\" title=\"\">more complicated story</a> about the devastating impact of the sense of powerlessness at the heart of urban communities.</p> <p>But preceding that report, and continuing beyond it, has been the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/interactive/2011/dec/14/reading-the-riots-investigating-england-s-summer-of-disorder-full-report\" title=\"\">Reading the Riots</a> investigation. Hundreds of rioters, victims and police have been interviewed. The Met's commissioner, Bernard Hogan-Howe, and home secretary Theresa May have contributed to further debate, filling out a picture of powerlessness and resentment in some cities and a dysfunctional relationship with the police where neither side could understand the other's behaviour. It revealed the way young men were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/dec/05/anger-police-fuelled-riots-study\" title=\"\">persistently stopped and searched</a> in a casually disrespectful way. It <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/11/metropolitan-police-riot-commissioner\" title=\"\">uncovered failings</a>, from the initial refusal to meet the family of Mark Duggan, whose shooting was the trigger for the first night of violence, to the sluggishness in calling in help from outside London.</p> <p>The riots were not a homogenous, uniform event. Social media, which the government initially declared had such an inflammatory influence that Twitter might have to be blocked, turned out to have had some effect in some places, particularly in London, but not everywhere, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/reading-the-riots-blog/2011/dec/08/social-media-riots-live-web-chat\" title=\"\">not at all in the first day or two</a>. Nor was it Facebook or Twitter (whatever some judges thought), but Blackberry's encrypted instant messaging that was the medium of choice. There was some gang involvement, notably in Notting Hill, as this week's court case confirmed \u2013 but it was also notable that the gangs in question suspended hostilities to work together. Manchester was different from Salford, but Handsworth was similar to Hackney.</p> <p>Yet despite all the <a href=\"http://www.york.ac.uk/media/sociology/curb/publications/Unrest16.pdf\" title=\"\">careful analysis from non-government sources</a>, despite the evidence of renewed efforts to develop community resilience \u2013 like those in Croydon where the torched remains of Reeves furniture store, restored, are newly decorated with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/06/london-communities\" title=\"\">optimistic messages</a> from locals \u2013 the official narrative is unchanged. Although police are scaling down stop and search and there are community projects attempting to educate both sides about the other's point of view, institutional failure is not officially registered. Above all, there is a reluctance to understand the riots as a further episode in the history of postwar British urban unrest, a shout for attention from people who feel shut out, whose education was a catastrophe and whose job prospects are nil, who see the rest of the world \u2013 even in a slump \u2013 cling to advantage they can only dream of, in short, a response to a world where there is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/dec/05/cameron-queen-injustice-english-rioters\" title=\"\">too little incentive to be law abiding</a>. This is a failure of politics, and it threatens to return to haunt those who will not listen.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney's campaign team mounted a counter-attack Friday over a controversial pro-Obama ad linking the Republican presidential challenger with a woman's death from cancer.</p> <p>The cancer ad is the most negative piece of campaigning yet, and has dominated the political agenda for three days. It overshadowed other issues at the daily White House press conference on Friday.</p> <p>The Romney camp put out an ad of its own, accusing Barack Obama of seeking to exploit the tragedy of the woman's death for political gain.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z-EEETo3Sqo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z-EEETo3Sqo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p></p> <p>Eric Fehrnstrom, a Romney campaign adviser, denounced the cancer ad, released on Tuesday. \"When you start running ads accusing your opponent of killing people, then you have lost credibility and I think that's where the Obama campaign finds itself,\" Fehrnstrom said. \"I don't think a world champion limbo dancer could get any lower than the Obama campaign right now.\"</p> <p>In the ad, paid for by one of the main Super Pacs backing Obama, Priorities USA Action, a former steelworker Joe Soptic recounts how when Bain Capital, which Romney headed, shut down his steel plant in 2001, he lost his family health benefits. His wife died of cancer five years later.</p> <p>Although Priorities USA Action insists it is not accusing Romney of being to blame for the woman's death, that is the implication: that the cancer might have been caught at an early stage if the plant had not closed and the Soptic family still had insurance coverage.</p> <p>The Romney campaign counters that the ad is inaccurate on several counts, not least that the woman had health coverage of her own.</p> <p>The White House is refusing either to endorse the ad or denounce it. Obama spokesman, Jay Carney, insisted that his campaign had no control over the actions of Priorities USA Action. \"We have no control over third-party ads,\" he said. Asked about whether the cancer link was appropriate in a political campaign, he said: \"It's not for me to do.\"</p> <p>Although Priorities USA Action insists it is planning to go ahead with airing the ad in swing states at a cost of $20m, it will have to decide whether the row is causing more damage to the Obama campaign than Romney's. It could make it harder for Obama to claim the moral high ground if, as expected, pro-Romney Super Pacs launch similar negative ads.</p> <p>One positive for the Obama campaign is that negative campaigning, while frequently deplored, usually works, and that Romney will be smeared by the ad anyway. The row is distracting voters from Romney's attempts to focus the election on economic issues.</p> <p>Carney claimed that there is no co-ordination between the Obama campaign and Priorities USA Action. But the founder of the Super Pac, Bill Burton, is a former White House spokesman, while David Plouffe, a senior White House adviser, was raising funds for the group earlier this year.</p> <p>An Obama campaign spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, while briefing reporters alongside Carney on an Obama campaign flight this week, initially denied the campaign knew anything about Soptic. It later turned out that he had appeared in an earlier campaign ad.</p> <p>The Romney ad issued on Friday says: \"What does it say about a president's character when his campaign tries to use the tragedy of a woman's death for political gain? What does it say about a president's character when he had his campaign raise money for the ad then stood by as his top aides were caught lying about it?</p> <p>\"Doesn't America deserve better than a president who will say or do anything to stay in power?\"</p>",
  "<p>In the 32 previous instances when voters have been asked to decide a ballot initiative on same-sex marriage, we have lost every single time \u2013 even, notoriously, in California, where polling before the vote on Proposition 8 suggested otherwise. But things are changing fast. The president, hurriedly, got on board in May. At the Democratic convention next month, the party will adopt a platform calling for marriage equality. And in three states, it's looking as if 2012 will be the year gay marriage breaks its electoral losing streak.</p> <p>This year, both Washington and Maryland adopted laws legalizing same-sex marriage, but homophobes have succeeded in postponing their enactment and getting a repeal on the November ballot. <a href=\"http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/2012/08/02/losing-streak-for-gay-marriage-over-polls/\">Surveys in both states</a> have marriage equality winning by comfortable margins \u2013 and in Maryland, notably, African-American voters' preferences <a href=\"http://bruni.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/02/hopeful-news-from-maryland/\">are statistically even</a>.</p> <p>Up in Maine, which rejected gay marriage at the ballot box in 2009, the same voters are now being asked to plump for equality, after all. It looks set to pass by a margin of 20 points. Better late than never.</p> <p>There's a fourth marriage referendum in Minnesota, though this one is just the usual case of writing discrimination into the state constitution. Same-sex marriage is already illegal there, but legislators want to amend the charter to defend against \"activist judges\". As is now traditional, a smiling, Botoxed-to-death local news anchor, one Kalley Yanta, has become the voice of the discrimination movement, warning that schoolchildren may face a <a href=\"http://youtu.be/wLjIXirNxnQ\">\"homosexualist\"</a> indoctrination campaign. (In case you were wondering, this Yanta character also opposes birth control; she was on the pill once, and \"God willing, if and when I make it to heaven when I die, I'm gonna meet <a href=\"http://youtu.be/eY--y8FkWjg\">those children that I killed</a> due to my selfishness. And I'm gonna have some serious apologizing to do!\")</p> <p>Polling in Minnesota has been mixed, and the wording of the question is still unclear. But the fact that it's even close suggests that the homosexualist indoctrination campaign appears to be underway already.</p> <p>So hooray, hooray: the tide is turning. But while I'm glad that more Americans are recognizing the need for equality, I wish it weren't being expressed through the toxic medium of the ballot initiative. Marriage is not a privilege conferred by voters or legislatures. It is \"one of the basic civil rights of man\", as the US supreme court wrote in <a href=\"http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=388&amp;invol=1\">Loving v Virginia</a>, the 1967 case that struck down miscegenation laws, and civil rights are not at the disposal of voters.</p> <p>We don't get to say who has them and who doesn't; we all have them. We call this equal protection \u2013 never a favorite constitutional clause among today's tricorn-wearing brigade \u2013 and the approval of a majority of voters on a given November day is not required.</p> <p>I'd hate to think, the day after a few blue states legalize gay marriage via referendum, that we then have to respect the decisions of the 30 states who've done the opposite. Yet that's the argument many gay supporters are making \u2013 even at the top.</p> <p>In his hasty interview with Robin Roberts, the president went out of his way, several times, to insist:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I think it is a mistake to try to make what has traditionally been a state issue into a national issue.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>He expressed no desire to overturn the recently adopted gay marriage prohibition in North Carolina. Rather creepily, Obama also said that he instructed the justice department to abandon the Defense of Marriage Act not because it discriminates against gays, but because it \"tried to federalize what has historically been state law\". We must hope that this was just political positioning, because as our law professor president surely knows, while marriage is a state affair, equality is a federal one. A class that faces discrimination enjoys constitutional protections that no state, and no state voters, can override.</p> <p>Gays, incontestably, are one of these classes. But it has been fashionable, these past few years, to say that marriage is some inviolable quantity that courts cannot touch, that \"unelected\" judges have no right to abrogate \"the will of the people\". I suppose if you've never heard of constitutional democracy, you might find such an argument persuasive, but this is not how the United States deals with any other kind of discrimination. Democracy is a lot more complicated than voting \u2013 in this post-Citizens United mire, only more so.</p> <p>\"Let the people decide\" is a favorite red-meat tactic of reactionary politicians who know that they have no legal authority to adopt the policy they'd like. But when it comes to marriage equality, the people have already decided. They did so back in 1868, when their state legislatures ratified the 14th amendment.</p> <p>So, while it'll be nice for a few states to give the answer we'd like to hear come November, we have to start insisting that the right to marry isn't properly conferred by simple majorities in one state after the next. It has to come from Washington. And as the president himself has calculated, the country is ready for it.</p>",
  "<p>After more than a decade of toiling to bring internet television to the mass market, Paula Byrne's time has come. A year ago, she sold her technology business to Amazon and now the online retailer has placed her in charge of its biggest engineering hub outside America, a team of several hundred housed in new offices near London's Silicon Roundabout.</p> <p>Amazon is entering the video rental business in a big way. But rather than receiving DVDs through the post, its customers will be watching films and TV series online.</p> <p>The US group has acquired LoveFilm, whose British boss, Simon Calver, has now moved on, and its engineering team has been merged with Byrne's.</p> <p>Together they will create the websites and apps that distribute Amazon's vast library of films and television shows to every shape and size of screen.</p> <p>Their remit is global. Byrne's team have just finished Amazon's video rental app for the iPad. \"You've got a group of people in the UK that isn't just building services for Europe,\" says Byrne, \"We are going to be doing this for Amazon on a worldwide basis. That is such a great thing for the UK economy.\"</p> <p>Amazon is the second American digital giant to plant the stars and stripes in TechCity, another name for the cluster of technology businesses that has formed near Old Street roundabout in east London.</p> <p>This spring, Google Campus opened in the area, offering desk space and mentoring to startups.</p> <p>For Byrne, the buzz is important. She enjoys her lunch hours in Whitecross Street, where street food stalls have revived the local market.</p> <p>\"You can feel it humming. There are people from technology, from media. We have brought hundreds more people like that into the area.\"</p> <p>A Liverpudlian who moved south to study business and marketing at the City of London Polytechnic, Byrne's career was launched in computer games. In the late 1980s, she found herself at Telecomsoft, a subsidiary of BT, doing a brisk trade selling games for Atari and Amiga consoles. In 1995, she was put in charge of developing what was probably the UK's first interactive TV service. The idea was to deliver all the benefits of the internet through the use of the remote control. An awkward alliance between Sky, BT and HSBC bank, it offered email and a limited range of shopping and financial services.</p> <p>The business, Open, was eventually sold to Sky and Byrne then set up on her own.</p> <p>It was her technology that enabled millions of X Factor viewers to propel Will Young, Leona Lewis and others into a pop career and others to eject Katie Price from I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here! by pressing their red buttons. Byrne's startup, Pushbutton, pioneered interactive services for Sky and ITV.</p> <p>As domestic broadband speeds increased, she turned her hand to delivering television over the internet. Pushbutton repurposed the iPlayer for BT Vision and helped put LoveFilm on Sony Bravia internet TVs and PlayStation games consoles.</p> <p>At home in Hertfordshire, Byrne's three teenage children already do most of their viewing through the use of games consoles.</p> <p>This is a pattern which is being repeated across the UK. Xboxes with internet connections are now being used to stream films from LoveFilm or its rival Netflix to the family television set. \"Although I've been at this a long time, it feels as if we are only just beginning,\" says Byrne. \"We are here now at this really sweet spot in time. We've got the technology that finally enables this experience that customers have wanted for years.\"</p> <p>The official statistics produced by TV measurement body Barb revealed that, in 2011, 91% of viewing was still live rather than on demand.</p> <p>In homes where internet TV is easy, such as those with a Virgin Media Tivo box, the picture is a little different. Virgin estimates that 1bn on-demand programmes were watched in 2011.</p> <p>Byrne thinks traditional television channels have some years left to run, but that their dominance has already been challenged.</p> <p>\"There are many ways content can be scheduled. For some people, TV channels fulfil that purpose; for others what is much more important is what the people they hang out with recommend. The way people choose what they want to watch is going to become more sophisticated and diverse.\"</p> <p>So Amazon is racing to adapt its service to every screen and gadget on the market. While it has its own tablet, the Kindle Fire, the retailer does not want to limit its potential audience. With a long list of jobs to do, it made sense to buy Byrne's company.</p> <p>Given the attention being paid to Amazon's low tax contribution to the UK, the decision to site a global engineering team in London was well timed politically.</p> <p>Byrne says the move was talent led. \"The UK has always had a great reputation in this industry. What Danny Boyle did in the Olympics opening ceremony summed up the kind of things that the UK is good at, executing things creatively and well,\" said Byrne.</p> <p>Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, has yet to pay a visit to Silicon Roundabout, but two weeks into the office move, Byrne isn't quite prepared for him yet.</p> <p>\"It's like when your in-laws come round, you want everything to be perfect,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>As week two of London 2012 comes to an end, some of our readers have been wondering how they'll cope when it's all over. I know the feeling.

The final itself was a wonderful moment of personal stories, difficult backgrounds and overcoming triumphing in the biggest stage there is. Gibbons had lost her mum--who first took her to Judo and nurtured her interest in the sport--years earlier and her \"thank you mum\" resounded in the media for days after. Her rival and gold medalist Kayla Harrison was a survivor of sexual abuse which would haunt her even to the point of her being suicidal and depressed throughout most of her teenage years and beyond. She not only managed to overcome but also win her country's first Judo gold. It was fantastic.</p> <p>Also noteworthy: Mo Farah's win, which for a recent immigrant such as myself did a great deal to instill a sense of hope and inclusion in this new country.

  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>The billionaire Barclay brothers have won their high court battle over the future of three of London's most prestigious hotels.</p> <p>Irish property tycoon Patrick McKillen sued the reclusive twins, Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay, claiming they had illegally bought a controlling stake he was entitled to in the Berkeley, Connaught and Claridge's hotels.</p> <p>But a judge rejected the claim in a case that has provided a rare insight into the dealings of some of the most powerful businessmen in the country.</p> <p>The court heard how McKillen, who owns 35% of Coroin, the hotels group, tried to take overall control by approaching various creditors and used former prime minister Tony Blair to act as an \"honest broker\" to set up a meeting with the Qatari royal family to secure funding for a bid.</p> <p>He claimed the funding had been in place when the Barclays, also owners of the Ritz and the Telegraph newspapers, jumped in to take overall control of the hotels by buying the debts owed by the third of the three shareholders in the group, Derek Quinlan.</p> <p>Quinlan, a member of the original consortium, had lost a fortune in the Irish property market collapse and had his debts controlled by Ireland's \"bad bank\", the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).</p> <p>McKillen claimed that a pre-emption clause meant he should have had first refusal to buy the stakes of any other investors in the hotels that came up for sale. But Mr Justice David Richards said the clause had not been breached.</p> <p>The judge added he did not believe McKillen had the funds in place to make an offer, despite Tony Blair Associates' attempts to set up meetings with possible funders in Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Kuwait and Oman.</p> <p>The court heard how Blair set up meetings with the son of Qatar's emir, Sheikh Hamad, but the deal never went ahead after McKillen called the Middle Eastern leader \"scum\" for changing the terms of their agreement.</p> <p>Witness statements paint a picture of septuagenarian twins with fading memories and loose control over their family interests, who are happy to sign paperwork they do not read or do not understand.</p> <p>Sir Frederick wrote in his statement: \"My memory is not what it once was (and, in any event, I have never been very good at dates).\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the Barclay brothers said the judgment \"vindicated the Barclay interests' position\".</p> <p>A spokeswoman for McKillen said while he \"might have lost this battle he was actually in a better position to win the war. The Barclay Brothers have not achieved their stated objective. We still have the right to purchase Quinlan's interest \u2026 at a later date should it become available\".</p>",

  "<p>JJB Sports is facing fresh speculation after emerging as a possible target of private equity tycoon Jon Moulton, who is best known for his failed attempt to rescue MG Rover. Better Capital, Moulton's listed buyout firm, has approached JJB's board and main lender with an offer to buy the troubled company's debt, according to Sky News. This would in effect hand control to Moulton.</p> <p>Shareholders are losing patience with the ailing sportswear chain, which last month warned for the umpteenth time that it was running out of cash. Moulton is not the only potential suitor; fund manager Invesco, which owns a 47% stake, is also said to want to buy JJB's outstanding debt from Lloyds Banking Group so it can force a restructuring. The Wigan-based chain has 180 stores and more than 4,000 employees.</p> <p>JJB's plea for more financial support came just four months after it received a \u00a330m injection. Two-thirds of this came from US retailer Dick's Sporting Goods; major shareholders Invesco, Harris Associates, Crystal Amber and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation stumped up the rest.

  "<p>Last night, the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008tj5q\" title=\"\">BBC2 series Wonderland</a> showed us two young men who had gone up to Oxbridge with the aim of involving themselves in student politics. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/aug/09/young-bright-and-on-the-right\" title=\"\">Young, Bright and On the Right</a> was both awkward and compelling television, exploring the skulduggery and eccentricity of student politics.</p> <p>In recent years, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Conservative_Association\" title=\"\">Oxford Conservative Association</a> (OCA) has become so notorious that it was forced to drop its association with the university after it made headlines in the press when members <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8870909/Oxford-Tories-nights-of-port-and-Nazi-songs.html\" title=\"\">allegedly sang Nazi songs</a>. This, sadly, was the focus of the show. The BBC provided us with long shots of young men in suits drinking tea, wiping their brows with floral handkerchiefs. It made for a depressing viewing, because behind the superficial details was a story which needs to be told: the importance of these student political societies to their members, and the doors which can be opened by student political involvement.</p> <p>When I began my undergraduate degree at Cambridge, I had come from an excellent school but still one at which there was no political curriculum and few opportunities for political debate. At Cambridge, there were more student political associations than I could have imagined. These institutions serve for many undergraduates as an awakening to the world of politics, a chance to break down the boundaries between us and the people we read about in the media. This opportunity to participate in, rather than just observe, politics is what inspires so many young people into activism and journalism.</p> <p>When I arrived at university, I had never met a politician. By the time I left I had not only met them, but publicly debated with them as well as, journalists, academics, and celebrities. The exposure to opposing points of view was one of the greatest rewards of being a student. Some of my contemporaries have already gone on to stand for election, edit newspapers and forge careers as columnists. The chance to meet and have proper, respectful conversations with people who disagree with you and come from an entirely different upbringing is too often lacking in our secondary school educational system.</p> <p>The beautiful and rarefied setting of both Oxford and Cambridge add an unhelpful patina to the stories of students like Joe Cooke and Chris Monk, who both featured in the programme. If the same series had followed the Liberal Democrat or Labour clubs, the background of seeming wealth and privilege would have been identical, and the opportunities to dine in black tie and drink port the same.</p> <p>Neither Cooke nor Monk were given much opportunity by the editors to explain why they were Conservative. Cooke had come from a northern background and at a young age, his father had been imprisoned. The most moving part of the programme came when Cooke broke down in tears, describing the decision he had made to alter his outward demeanour to fit in: it was crushingly difficult for him to talk about this, and yet we never heard much about the passion and heartfelt ideology which must have pushed him to make this choice.</p> <p>Similarly, Monk was described as being rightwing by his Liberal Democrat parents, but we heard nothing of his beliefs. Monk made efforts to volunteer as a steward at the union, and cosied up to the higher echelons in the association to aid his progress. Despite coming from a very ordinary background, he openly criticised the prospect of widening access to the Conservative association for fear of upsetting the current members. That pressure to fit into a political identity needs to be removed. There is no doubting that the eccentric and somewhat indulgent activities of OCA are beyond the experience of most political activists; what matters most when it comes to student political engagement is that more people step up and become involved.</p> <p>How much of what went on at OCA was the result of the environment in which it occurred, we cannot say. A heady mix of subsidised dinners, ancient buildings and a swollen sense of entitlement can bring out the silliest in most undergraduates. For all prospective applicants reading this, I have to say that there are decent, hardworking and passionate groups of people at Oxford and Cambridge, from all class and economic backgrounds, who are made to feel welcome. Since 2000, 38% of the chairmen and women of the Cambridge University Conservative Association have come from state schools. Only a tiny minority of the people I met acted the way that OCA was portrayed on TV (and the most eccentric, foppish character I knew went on to stand as a Labour candidate).</p> <p>Watching BBC2 last night, you'd have been forgiven for thinking that student politics is a purely dreadful experience. What the show didn't focus on were the opportunities for Joe, Chris and students from any background to take part in our national political conversation. For all the silliness, sadness and scandal, there is lurking behind it a great story about young people having the chance to learn about themselves and to become politically engaged. It's a pity we didn't see more of it.</p>",
  "<p>There are three words MP Aidan Burley must want to forget: \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/28/olympics-opening-ceremony-multicultural-crap-tory-mp\" title=\"\">leftie multicultural crap</a>.\" But it seems the rest of us can't because we were in the throes of a British triumph, and even the cynics were filled with pride. As quickly as one of the Mary Poppins falling from the sky could say supercalifragilisticexpialidocious the outpouring from Downing Street came \u2013 \"we do not agree\", \"Burley has behaved in a manner which is offensive and foolish\", \"Burley was completely wrong, an idiotic thing to say\" \u2013 followed by voice after voice condemning him from every corner of our multicultural society.</p> <p>But, was it not <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/feb/05/david-cameron-speech-criticised-edl\" title=\"\">David Cameron who declared the failure of multiculturalism</a> in the UK just last year in his speech at a security conference in Munich? No wonder he was so quick to distance himself from Burley \u2013 reopening this debate just as a multicultural triumph falls his way could be just a little uncomfortable.</p> <p>And perhaps rightly so: a new report stands alongside the wave of British people rejecting Burley's views, showing a rather different take on multiculturalism in the UK. Using the <a href=\"http://www.brin.ac.uk/news/2011/ethnic-minority-british-election-study-2009-2010-now-online/\" title=\"\">2010 Ethnic Minority British Election Survey</a> (funded by the Economic and Social Research Council) which questioned members of the UK's five main minority groups \u2013 Indian (Hindu, Sikh and Muslim), Pakistani, Bangladeshi, black Caribbean and black African (Muslim and Christian) \u2013 it examines the alleged aspects of multiculturalism's \"failure\". These being: one, that multiculturalism has encouraged exclusion rather than inclusion, by siphoning minority communities away from the mainstream, and condemning them to live parallel lives. Two, that by living parallel lives minorities preserve their ethnic behaviours and values that run counter to broader society. And three, these separate communities provide fertile soil for radicalisation.</p> <p>The report reveals that while some first generation minorities do tend to marry and mix within their own ethnic communities, they also mix within neighbourhoods and workplaces, showing a definite willingness to integrate. The second generation \u2013 those educated and raised here in Britain \u2013 show a further 27% shift towards integration, with greater social and workplace mixing, and a significant increase in marriages across community divides. Results show black groups especially have \"little or no problem\" contemplating marriage with white people. The notion that even the most inward looking minority is entrenched in a parallel society is a gross overstatement.</p> <p>Data from the 2007 England and Wales citizenship survey reinforces these findings, showing 85% of white British people agreed to \"fairly or very strongly feeling that they belong to Britain\", where 89% of both Indian and Pakistani, 87% of Bangladeshi and 84% of both black African and black Caribbean agreed. Worrying statistics?</p> <p>Nor is there evidence to support claims that ethnic communities behave in ways that run counter to broader society's values. The new report finds that all groups of ethnic minorities support the maintenance of their own ethnic customs and traditions, but they also show equally striking support for mixing and integrating: with positive feelings about the cultures of both origin and destination countries. The 2007 citizenship survey, meanwhile, reveals that the great majority of ethnic minorities and white British people feel \"one can belong to Britain and maintain a separate/religious identity\".</p> <p>Traditional gender roles in some minority communities are often spoken of as evidence of their parallel lives. The new report does find some support for this, but even in the first generation such attitudes are a minority preserve; indeed, the support is in line with the 14% of white British people who also favour the patriarchal model. It also shows that only one fifth of Muslims would support a proposal of sharia law in Britain. Yes, critics may worry it is this high, and we can't deny that some support for separatism does exist, but similarly we can't deny that some white British people support ethnic exclusionism. From these results it would seem the characterisation of minorities as living separate lives, rejecting British values and integration into British society is, to put it mildly, a slur on those British citizens.</p> <p>And what of radicalisation? The debate is one where politicians focus their attention on Muslims \u2013 yes, the 7/7 bombings by home-grown Islamists were serious cause for concern. But this report shows that Muslims are no more willing to support violent protest, and are no more likely to reject integration into British society or a British identity, than any other group, including whites. It is in fact black groups, especially those of black Caribbean origin, who feel the most alienated and disaffected in British society; not Muslims. The other distinguishing characteristic of people who might be prepared to support violent protest \u2013 other than the experience of discrimination which is the number one contributor \u2013 is that they are young and male; a profile that almost certainly fits white British protesters too.</p> <p>As we British fans fill those Olympic seats and cheer Team GB, it matters not whether those athletes are first generation, second generation, mixed race, or white. We support every one of them with pride and patriotic emotion. And each athlete is equally as proud to carry the union flag and sing the national anthem as any of their team-mates. As our Olympics ceremony told the world, we have a modern history \u2013 an inclusive one \u2013 which we are proud of. Perhaps we could say Britain is in fact a rather successful multicultural society.</p> <p>\u2022 The research was conducted by a team led by Professor Anthony Heath, FBA (Oxford and Manchester universities). Full details of the research are available on the <a href=\"http://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/index.php/research/embes-the-ethnic-minority-british-election-study.html\" title=\"\">EMBES website</a>, and a book with the results will be published next year by Oxford University Press.</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>The publication of A-level results next week is expected to trigger an intense scramble for places in clearing as many leading universities have declared there will be no spare places this year.</p> <p>A survey by the Guardian has found that 13 universities do not expect to have places in clearing, while three more are unlikely to have places.</p> <p>Despite a fall in applications after universities were permitted to raise tuition fees, demand for a university education remains high. So far this year, there have been more than 618,000 applications for about half a million places on degree courses.</p> <p>Each year, nearly 50,000 students who fail to make their grades secure their university places through clearing.</p> <p>Out of 38 universities that responded to the Guardian survey, 22 expect to have places in clearing this year.</p> <p>Cambridge, Oxford, LSE, St Andrew's, Warwick, UCL, Durham, Imperial, Bristol, Birmingham, King's College London, Strathclyde and Robert Gordon University have all declared themselves full. Bath, Exeter and Loughborough said they were unlikely to have places.</p> <p>Queen Mary, University of London, will have about 500 places this year across all areas apart from medicine, dentistry and law. Plymouth University will have 300 places, mainly in science subjects. Goldsmiths expects to have about 100 places in clearing this year, against 150 last year.</p> <p>Under reforms introduced by the coalition, universities will be able to expand to take on as many UK students as they wish who achieve grades of AAB or higher at A-level. This change was intended to inject some competition into the university sector, modifying a system in which universities have a fixed quota of places for UK undergraduates each year.</p> <p>However, the Guardian's survey indicates this change may have a limited impact on the most selective universities, many of which recruit students with higher grades than AAB.</p> <p>Oxford and Cambridge have ruled out expanding under the AAB reform. Among Russell Group universities, Bristol plans a significant expansion \u2013 admitting an additional 600 UK undergraduates this year \u2013 while UCL intends to add another 300.</p> <p>However, the change may mean that some candidates whose grades are a near miss lose out.</p> <p>Andrea Robertson, director of customer operations for the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, said: \"In 2012, the new student number control arrangements mean that if the institution chooses to accept an applicant who achieves ABB against an offer of AAB then the individual counts towards the institution's allocation of publicly funded places \u2013 rather than being considered to be AAB+ or equivalent and therefore uncontrolled in terms of student numbers.</p> <p>\"These arrangements and the redistribution of funded places mean that for some courses there is an increased likelihood that some institutions will not be able to accept 'near miss' applicants when in previous years they might have been able to.\"</p> <p>Some universities have sought to attract high-performing students with scholarships, including the offer of a \u00a31,000-a-year award at Coventry, and a \u00a32,000 scholarship offered by Kent to any student who achieves 3As at A-level.</p>",
  "<p>As debuts go Manchester United's first day on the New York stock exchange was a disappointment. But the world's most famous club should probably be grateful it got off at all.</p> <p>United's initial public offering (IPO) was the largest and most high profile in New York since Facebook's ill-fated listing in May. United's co-chairmen Avram and Joel Glazer and the chief executive David Gill applauded the start of trading from the Wall Street exchange's balcony, which was adorned with the club's emblem. Some traders even wore the club's trademark red home kit. But the support did little to boost the stock price.</p> <p>The already troubled sale hit another bump late Thursday as United's bankers, who had been looking to charge between $16 and $20 for the shares, slashed the price to launch the sale at $14 (\u00a39). The move shaved as much as $100m off the proceeds expected for the team and its owners. Even at the new low price, enthusiasm was lacking. Shares eked up just 5 cents in early trading and ended the day at $14.</p> <p>While the club failed to raise the money it had been seeking, United have still officially become the most valuable sports club in the world valued at $2.3bn (\u00a31.47bn), eclipsing the $2.15bn paid this year for the Los Angeles Dodgers or the $1.8bn value of Real Madrid, according to an annual ranking by Forbes magazine.</p> <p>There is no doubting the team's achievements, 19-times English champions and famous from Beijing to Baltimore. But for some on Wall Street, the financials just do not add up. The club is using money to pay down part of its $683m (\u00a3437m) debt but will still be saddled with debts of $573m (\u00a3366m) after the deal is done. Last year its revenues were \u00a3331m ($516m) \u2013 at $2.3bn the club is valued at 130 times those earnings, meaning it would take 130 years for the club to make that much money. It makes the $480m the Boston Red Sox owner paid for Liverpool, United's arch-rivals, look like a bargain.</p> <p>Wall Street analysts had been dismissive of the sale well ahead of the IPO. One dismissed the club's share sale as \"merchandise\" and predicted further trouble ahead. \"Winning teams don't necessarily make winning investments,\" said Sam Hamadeh, founder of analyst PrivCo. Hamadeh said small investors were \"tired of being burned by big brand names that turn out to be poor investments\".</p> <p>\"Look at Facebook, look at Groupon, both turned out to be a disaster for small investors. I think they should be applauded for avoiding this one,\" he said. Hamadeh, one of the few to predict Facebook's shares would crash and burn, said he believed United were probably worth closer to $6. \"Once the fans have bought in and things have calmed down, this company will start trading on its fundamentals. And they are not great,\" he said.</p> <p>United have found it difficult to find a stock exchange to call home. The lower flotation price comes after the Glazer family, which bought the club in 2005 and also owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football team, previously failed to garner enough support to sell shares in Hong Kong and Singapore.In part those sales foundered as investors balked at United's share structure. The Glazers have created two classes of shares and will control the club through their ownership of Class B shares that have 10 times the voting rights of the Class A shares they are selling to the public.</p> <p>The Glazer's ownership of United has angered some fans in the US. Manchester United Supporters Trust (MUST), a dissident fan group, said they hoped the price would fall, opening up the club to a possible takeover. With this away game off to such a disappointing start, they may just get their wish.</p>",
  "<p>The current war of words between the US and UK over banking regulation has a familiar ring to it. When the US passed the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley_Act\">Sarbanes Oxley bill in 2002</a>, in the wake of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal\">the Enron debacle</a>, the London Stock Exchange spotted a marketing opportunity. The Sox bill imposed more onerous reporting requirements on the corporate sector and the stock exchange thought it could use its lack of red tape to attract more companies to list in London.</p> <p>This proved extremely successful \u2013 and London became a popular place for international companies to raise capital. Controversially, a London listing added a veneer of respectability to a host of mining companies with minimal business in London.</p> <p>It was the same with the banks. Successive British governments boasted about the co-operative approach adopted by London regulators, compared to the legalistic US stance.</p> <p>But we all know where light-touch regulation has ended up: about \u00a32tn ($3.13tn) sunk into supporting the banks and the return, for the UK, to the depths of a double-dip recession. So you can't blame <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/07/standard-chartered-joins-british-banks-in-us-sights\">New York regulators for spotting an opportunity of their own</a>. Brussels is doing the same.</p> <p>Our banks have hardly helped themselves. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/02/timeline-key-events-libor-barclays?INTCMP=SRCH\">Barclays admitted manipulating a leading benchmark interest rate for years</a> \u2013 first, for its own gain, and then, to convince regulators it was healthier than it looked. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2012/jul/17/hsbc-money-laundering-barclays\">HSBC turns out to have been accepting truckloads of dollars from money launderers with no questions asked</a>.</p> <p>Yet I stopped in my tracks this week when the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/07/standard-chartered-iran-justice-department\">accusations against Standard Chartered were made</a>. The bank is a byword for respectability. It came through the financial crisis largely unscathed. Its former chairman moved on to the House of Lords, where he currently champions getting more women onto company boards. Its current head only recently said the bank's business was so boring it was unlikely to come to the attention of regulators.</p> <p>And here was a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/06/standard-chartered-iran-transactions\">new regulator I had not heard of calling it a \"rogue institution\" for processing Iranian transactions</a>. This seems to have come like a bolt out of the blue for the bank as well since it was not ready with any statement to react to the allegations. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/08/standard-chartered-chief-defends-bank\">It has since come out fighting and is disputing the charge</a>.</p> <p>The New York regulator says the bank processed $250bn of transactions. Standard Chartered says only $14m did not comply with the rules.</p> <p>As the mud has started flying, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2185688/Stop-beating-banks-US-warned-New-York-regulators-jealous-Citys-success.html\">London's mayor Boris Johnson has accused New York regulators</a> of being tougher on foreign institutions than their own banks. But who can blame them for trying to win back a bit of business and influence?</p> <p>US regulators tend to be higher-profile than their UK counterparts, and some are keen to make a name for themselves. In a previous life, Eliot Spitzer took on Wall Street ahead of running for office \u2013 until he was brought down by his own reputational damage. Benjamin Lawsky, the new guy on the block at the New York State Department of Financial Services, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/10/business/regulator-shines-spotlight-on-a-bank-and-on-himself.html?pagewanted=all&amp;gwh=90CD4A920340F4F0CAEAFEAB5A567901\">could be keen to show he can be just as tough as any of his fellow law enforcers</a>.</p> <p>However, there is a more serious issue at stake here: that is, whether the banks are inherently ungovernable. Bankers at Barclays and HSBC appear to have been out of control.</p> <p>These scandals seem even worse to me than trading in toxic derivatives \u2013 even though that nearly brought the entire financial system crashing down. These bankers were acting intentionally against the spirit, if not the letter, of the law. They have discredited the City of London's reputation across the world.</p> <p>That culture is set at the very top of a bank. If directors are pushing hard for profits at any cost, employees will bend the rules accordingly. Compliance departments are there to guard against it, but in many British banks, they have a lowly status.</p> <p>British regulators are talking about a crackdown, but little has actually changed. So who can blame New York for taking a tough stance? Our banks have brought it on themselves.</p>",

  "<p>David Cameron's appearance on Chris Evans's Radio 2 breakfast show has caused consternation at the BBC, with senior figures within the corporation unaware that the prime minister was booked to appear.</p> <p>BBC insiders said there were fears that Cameron's 20-minute interview with Evans on the country's most popular breakfast show on Thursday breached BBC rules on impartiality.</p> <p>Cameron read out messages from listeners and told Evans about the legacy of the London Olympics, defending the government's policy on the controversial issue of the sale of school playing fields.</p> <p>One BBC source said they expected Labour leader Ed Miliband would be badgering the corporation to come on to Radio 2 to read out listener text messages next week. But there is no indication that Labour is preparing a complaint about the Cameron interview.</p> <p>The BBC has strict guidelines governing the appearance of politicians on non-news programmes, which require senior executive approval, as well as topical issues that are the subject of public debate.</p> <p>Such is the level of sensitivity over the interview that the BBC is believed to have discussed internally whether to remove it from the iPlayer. It <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01lhbzq/The_Chris_Evans_Breakfast_Show_09_08_2012/\" title=\"\">remained available at the time of publication</a>.</p> <p>\"Nobody knew anything until it was too late to do anything about it. It was a huge cock-up,\" said one BBC insider.</p> <p>\"The BBC has made huge efforts and spent an enormous amount of time on maintaining its impartiality during the course of the Olympics, and then this screws the whole thing up,\" said another corporation source.</p> <p>\"David Cameron went unchallenged for virtually the entire interview. It appears the editorial guidelines have got everything covered apart from the possibility that the prime minister might turn up to read listener dedications.\"</p> <p>Cameron defended the government's policy on sport in schools, saying only 21 playing fields had been sold off since 2010, 14 of which were schools that had been closed and four had merged, he told Evans.</p> <p>The prime minister was interrupted by the DJ who told him: \"It's not the Today programme, I don't care about the facts and figures.\"</p> <p>Cameron responded: \"We are not selling off playing fields, it's very important we keep them.\"</p> <p>Britain's legacy from the 2012 Games and efforts to encourage more children to become involved in sport is already a source of much political debate.</p> <p>The entire interview, which took place live from the Olympics Park, where Evans is on location for the duration of the Games, was conducted with the BBC's Olympics theme, composed by Elbow, playing in the background.</p> <p>Cameron read out a number of text messages from listeners in the \"listener breaking news\" section of the show, which included \"I let my new chickens out this morning\" and \"On my way to pick up my new Mini\".</p> <p>The prime minister commented: \"That's buying British, I approve of that.\"</p> <p>Evans, who introduced Cameron as the \"prime minister of Great Britain, the ultimate Team GB\", read out the newspaper headlines and asked Cameron: \"They've not been bad headlines over the last 13 days, have they prime minister?\"</p> <p>Cameron said it had been a \"wonderful few weeks for Britain, every day there is something to lift the spirits\".</p> <p>He added that he had been doing \"big deals for Britain\" and wanted to reassure listeners that \"I am also chairing the Cobra meetings\".</p> <p>Evans said the Cobra meetings sound \"so James Bondy\" and was a \"pretty cool name\". Cameron replied: \"I promise there isn't someone stroking a white cat.\"</p> <p>The BBC's editorial guidelines state: \"Any proposal to invite a politician to be a guest on a programme or area of content where to do so is the exception rather than the rule, must be referred to chief cdviser politics [Ric Bailey].</p> <p>\"We must apply due impartiality to all our subject matter. However, there are particular requirements for 'controversial subjects', whenever they occur in any output, including drama, entertainment and sport.\"</p> <p>A BBC spokesman said: \"The BBC is committed to impartiality across its output and, while the Chris Evans Show has a lighter, more conversational tone than our news programming, it is entirely appropriate and within BBC guidelines for political figures to appear on entertainment shows, as long as those with alternate views are offered the same opportunity over time.

  "<p>Like the other military policemen in the minibus, Mohammad Asaad was wearing civilian clothes as he set off for work in the north of the province of Damascus. \"No one would take the risk of wearing uniform,\" he told me as he lay in his bloodstained T-shirt in Tishreen military hospital, Syria's main centre for wounded security force personnel and their families.</p> <p>At An Nabk, a small town about 35 miles from the capital, the crowded minibus came across an unexpected obstacle on Thursday morning. \"We were surprised to see insurgents blocking the road. Without warning they started shooting,\" he recalled as doctors dressed his injured arm.</p> <p>\"They used every kind of weapon. Our minibus tipped over, and several people died,\" he said. \"The passengers included civilians and one of the dead was a mother. The insurgents ran off and we managed to call for help to bring us here.\"</p> <p>In a nearby ward another policeman who survived the incident was about to be X-rayed. Doctors said the attack had produced six \"martyrs\", the standard term used by all sides in Syria's civil war for military and civilian dead. Five others needed surgery.</p> <p>The lethal encounter was typical of a conflict in which a growing number of government troops and police are dying. Hundreds of police and soldiers are losing their lives in ambushes and other attacks along Syria's roads as they try to contain the opposition and bring reinforcements to areas of fighting.</p> <p>In another ward at the military hospital two young conscripts, barely out of their teens, were being treated. One was in too much pain to talk. The other described how the roadside military post they were guarding came under attack, also on Thursday morning, in Al Tall, a district on Damascus's northern outskirts. They were struck by bullets but managed to escape and hide.</p> <p>Within the last few weeks the rebel attacks have come closer to Damascus. Fighting erupted in several outlying districts of the capital in the last two weeks of July. Although the rebels withdrew from some of them after heavy government retaliation, the regular sound of artillery and helicopters is causing widespread concern.</p> <p>Many better-off residents are sending spouses and children to Beirut or Amman. \"My daughter and her family moved the children's beds into the corridor. They look out over eastern Damascus towards Qaboon, and the noise was too intense and frightening. They have now moved to Lebanon,\" one resident, a strong critic of the government, told me.</p> <p>Several government officials also keep their spouses and children out of the country, and are not penalised for it. An estimated 15,000 poorer people have fled from districts where clashes have occurred and are sheltering in schools. The International Committee of the Red Cross and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent have been providing emergency food, water, and healthcare for thousands of displaced people around the city and in Damascus province. The UN refugee agency is providing blankets. Next week it plans to start providing hot meals for at least 6,000 families who cannot cook their own iftar, the meal that ends the daytime fast during the month of Ramadan.</p> <p>The army has stepped up the random searches at checkpoints on the main roads in and out of the city, creating major traffic jams during rush hour. Minibuses \u2013 the favourite form of public transport for the city \u2013 are often stopped and passengers, in particular young men, are asked to show their IDs. One young man sitting next to me was ordered off the bus when the soldier queried whether he was really a resident of the city.</p> <p>Compared with the scene in February when I last visited Damascus, the mood is clearly tenser. At that time it was sometimes hard to believe that war was raging elsewhere in Syria. The capital itself, with its tree-lined streets in the city centre, looked completely normal, with children playing in parks and women walking unescorted even after dark. The streets are emptier now and fewer shops stay open in the late evening, even though after a day of blistering 100-degree temperatures, it is the best time to be outside. \"Normally in Ramadan after iftar, the streets are full of people enjoying the cool air. Look at it now. This is the reaction to what's going on,\" said a government official.</p> <p>Staff at Tishreen hospital confirm there has been a surge in violence, though they blame the rebels. \"The number of injured we treat has increased over the last six months, and particularly over the last month, because of the escalation of support for the terrorists. The average intake of wounded now ranges between 20 and 50 a day. They mainly come from districts of Damascus province, though because we are the best military hospital in the country, we get some from further away if they have complicated wounds,\" said the hospital's director, who holds the military rank of general. His office walls have three pictures of President Bashar al-Assad, one alongside his baby son, and two of the Syrian leader's father, Hafez al-Assad. A wiry figure with short gray hair, the general wore full army uniform, complete with black boots, though \u2013 like the wounded policemen \u2013 he said he and his colleagues had stopped wearing uniform on their way to and from work. For what he also called safety reasons he declined to give his name. Four of the hospital's nurses and two doctors had been killed on their way to work in the last six weeks, he said.</p> <p>\"We have about 20 martyrs daily, only one or two of whom are civilians,\" he added. A few die in hospital but most of the dead are soldiers whose bodies are brought to the morgue for relatives to collect for burial. A five-minute service is held in a concrete yard at the back of the building in front of a triptych of paintings on large boards, one showing the eternal flame at the tomb of the unknown soldier, the centre-piece a montage of wings, anchor and crossed swords, marking the three armed services, and on the right-hand panel the national flag. As we watched, a coffin of cheap-looking, almost paper-like, wood, draped in the flag, and with the name of a dead soldier at the front, was loaded into the back of a minivan, and two relatives got in beside the driver and drove off to a cemetery.</p> <p>The general complained that foreign governments were aiding what he called the terrorists. \"It has escalated here because of money being pumped in from Qatar and Saudi Arabia and support from the United States and Britain. The US and Britain claim to be fighting terrorism but why do they support Islamic extremists and terrorists on our soil?</p> <p>\"When insurgents attacked soldiers in Sinai, Israel and Egypt were allowed to slap them down, so why don't they allow our army to hit the terrorists here? The US supported the mujahideen in Afghanistan because they were fighting the Soviet Union, but then the US had to kill some of the same jihadis,\" he said.</p> <p>In a bed in a private room upstairs Haytham Shaaban, a wounded colonel, lay with both legs bandaged below the knee and his right leg in a metal clamp. He is an Alawite from a small town near Tartus in Syria's coastal north-west, the heartland of the Alawite offshoot of Shia Islam, from which the ruling Assad family comes. His wife who sat near him is Sunni, while another middle-aged couple visiting them were also Alawite and Sunni.</p> <p>Colonel Shaaban claimed that Syria's rebels were trying to divide people on the basis of their sect when intercommunal relations in Syria's multicultural society had always been good, as his own family and friends could testify. Like other government loyalists, he insisted Syria's protesters were manipulated by an outside conspiracy.</p> <p>\"The demonstrators were told to raise the issue of sectarianism,\" he said. \"That was the demand of the countries which organised this.\" He acknowledged Syrians were angry with corruption but argued: \"If this was a revolution against corruption, we would have joined it ourselves and the president would have been the first to join it.\"</p> <p>This week's defection by Prime Minister Riyad Hijab, a staunch official with a long history of loyalty to the Ba'ath party, raised rebel hopes of further cracks in the government hierarchy. It led Jay Carney, the White House spokesman, to claim it as \"a sign that Assad's grip on power is loosening\". Colonel Shaaban denied this.</p> <p>\"We will terminate the criminal groups supported by Arab and foreign countries and make Syria secure again. They'll never undermine our morale,\" he declared. He followed the official spin, put out on state TV, of remaining cool and not denouncing the former prime minister as a traitor or a rat. As the colonel put it, \"the government is not linked to one person. It's a personal decision.\"</p> <p>Earlier, a senior government official, who did not wish to be named, told me: \"This country is not normal at the moment. Fear can surprise one. There are three ways of reacting. You can become more stubborn in your views. You can resign and keep quiet. Or you can defect.\"</p>",
  "<p>Officials planning for the 2012 Olympics embraced the opportunity to clean up and rebuild a vast parcel of east London, which had become an industrial dumping ground over the past century. Ken Livingstone, the London mayor at the time of the Olympic bid in 2005, famously said the Olympic project would spur a massive regeneration of this area over several decades, interrupted by a few weeks of sport.</p> <p>Besides the world class sports venues that will remain, the site now offers one of Europe's largest urban parks, a much-improved communications and transportation infrastructure and, eventually, thousands of new homes. These visible improvements have certainly engaged the media and the public, and many see this transformation as the long-term legacy of the Games.</p> <p>But the more lasting legacy from the Games may be less obvious to the typical spectator, according to several sustainability practitioners, as London will pass to future event organisers and suppliers a pack of new standards and best practices in sustainable event management, construction and sourcing.</p> <p>During my <a href=\"http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/q-and-a-greening-the-london-olympics/\" title=\"\">recent conversation</a> with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/david-stubbs\" title=\"\">David Stubbs</a>, head of sustainability for the <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/about-us/the-people-delivering-the-games/locog/\" title=\"\">London Organising Committee</a> (LOCOG), he highlighted two of these standards in particular: the new Event Sustainability Management System from the International Organization for Standardization (<a href=\"http://www.iso20121.org\" title=\"\">ISO 20121</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/about-us/sustainability/food-vision/\" title=\"\">Food Vision</a>, a blueprint for sustainable food sourcing.</p> <p>ISO standards touch just about every business segment, but until London 2012, no international, auditable standard on sustainability was available to the event sector. Preparing for the games was the spark that helped finalise ISO 20121, which was officially launched in June, and helped LOCOG put sustainability considerations at the heart of the planning process, said Stubbs.</p> <p>Rather than dictating specific targets or sustainability measures, the new standard enables organisers and suppliers to first identify key areas of impact that will be unique to their event. It then guides them through the process of gathering input from stakeholders, developing plans and setting goals to reduce negative impacts, measuring progress and reporting results.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sustainableeventsltd.com/fiona-pelham/\" title=\"\">Fiona Pelham</a>, who chaired the ISO 20121 committee, describes the approach as a \"way of working\" as opposed to a rigid checklist with a one-size-fits-all set of criteria.</p> <p>\"It's about identifying your concerns and understanding what you can control and influence because each venue is unique with its own particular issues that may relate to the environment, social impacts, or economic concerns,\" says Pelham.</p> <p>Representatives from 30 countries, many from the event industry, helped develop the standard, which Pelham expects will be used for events of all sizes going forward, including the upcoming Olympic Games in Russia and Brazil.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/about-us/sustainability/food-vision/\" title=\"\">Food Vision</a> programme, which was codified in 2009, attempts to mitigate the enormous footprint caused by producing and delivering food for events, which for the London Games has been estimated at 14 million meals across 40 venues.</p> <p>The program required producers and suppliers to adhere to a number of food-related standards (like Fairtrade, <a href=\"http://www.msc.org\" title=\"\">Marine Stewardship Council</a> certified fish and <a href=\"http://www.redtractor.org.uk/Home\" title=\"\">Farm Assured Red Tractor</a>) that cover just about every consequence of the food life cycle, including quality and labelling, animal welfare, environmental impacts, and labor issues.</p> <p>Also included in the vision was the commitment to source foods from Britain whenever possible. The programme applied to food arranged by LOCOG, which covers most of the food that will be served during the games. An additional 10 to 20 percent will be served by sponsors like McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Cadbury, who voluntarily applied some of the standards.</p> <p>Several large organisations are already looking at implementing these food sourcing standards, according to Kath Dalmeny, who served on the <a href=\"http://www.sustainweb.org/olympicfood/olympic_food_standards/\" title=\"\">advisory group</a> that developed the programme. She also serves as policy director of <a href=\"http://www.sustainweb.org/\" title=\"\">Sustain</a>, an organisation that now runs <a href=\"http://www.foodlegacy.org\" title=\"\">Food Legacy</a>, promoting uptake of the Food Vision standards.</p> <p>\"We are working with lots of organisations including the mayor's office and other government departments, the Metropolitan Police, the prison service and parts of the armed forces - all of them major buyers of food,\" she says.</p> <p>Many of the specified standards are UK-specific, while others have an international reach. Still, because the framework sets out clear principles and themes, it should be applicable anywhere with local adaptation, says Dalmeny.</p> <p>The examples above highlight just two of the new standards now available to event planners and the vast supply chain that supports them. Among many other outcomes from the Games, the <a href=\"http://www.cslondon.org\" title=\"\">Commission for a Sustainable London 2012</a>, an independent watchdog, will be evaluating their impact and relevance for future events.</p> <p>Shaun McCarthy, chair of the commission, asserts that you can never have a zero impact Games, but other knowledge, experience and best practices that emerge can help offset this impact.</p> <p>\"The key principle we work with at the Commission is that there is no such thing as sustainable Olympic Games,\" says McCarthy. \"Using all that resource to watch people run around is not a sustainable thing to do, unless you can make a difference in a wider sense.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The City has welcomed the news that one of its own is to become the new chairman of <strong>Barclays</strong> in the wake of the bank's involvement in the libor scandal.</p> <p>Sir David Walker, a former Morgan Stanley executive, Bank of England and Treasury official and the author of a key report on the banking system, was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/09/barclays-sir-david-walker-new-chairman\" title=\"\">named on Thursday night</a> as a replacement for current Barclays' chairman Marcus Agius.</p> <p>Barclays' shares reacted with a 4.45p gain to 183.4p, making them the biggest riser in an otherwise moribund market.</p> <p>Shore Capital analyst Gary Greenwood said the new chairman ticked all the right boxes:</p> <blockquote> We struggle to see how the board could have found a better candidate for the role given his long career in financial services, including both investment banking and retail banking, close connections with the Treasury and Bank of England, and his keen interest in corporate governance via the Walker Review. Importantly, he also has no previous ties with Barclays that we are aware of, making him the independent appointment that we had deemed a necessity if Barclays is to clean up its reputation. <br> His first job will be to find a new chief executive, for which we also view an outside appointment as being essential. Once this move has been completed, we would expect further senior heads to roll as the company looks to further clean up its image. Going forward, we expect Barclays to adopt a more conservative strategy than it has in the past, which could see the aggressive expansion story that has been pursued by the investment bank being de-emphasised somewhat. This is something we would welcome as we believe investment banking is likely to be a low return industry over the long-run, given planned regulatory change. </blockquote> <p>Ian Gordon at Investec agreed the appointment was a good one, politically safe and usefully quick, although he added that investors should not obsess over the chairman's profile:</p> <blockquote> The chief executive appointment is arguably more critical to harvesting [former boss] Bob Diamond's rich legacy, and above all else, we see Barclays as a strong, defensively positioned bank trading at the wrong price. It has outperformed all UK banks since its libor-related sell-off. <br> </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Standard Chartered</strong> closed down 36.5p at 1326.5p as the fallout continued from Monday's accusations by a New York regulator that the bank was involved in illegal transactions with Iran.</p> <p>Although its shares have recovered from their lows - they slumped to \u00a310.92 at one point - they are still more than 15% down since the scandal broke. Investors feared Standard could lose its US banking licence, although it came out fighting against the charges.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> dipped 4.40 points to 5847.11 after five days of rises, in the wake of worse than expected Chinese trade data, which showed lower than forecast imports and exports and raised fears of a sharp slowdown in the country's economy.</p> <p>But over the week the leading index has climbed 60 points - albeit in thin trading with the usual summer lull exaggerated by the rival attractions of the Olympics.</p> <p><strong>Prudential</strong> put on 6p to 810p following a 13% rise in half year operating profits to \u00a31.16bn.</p> <p>Rival <strong>Aviva</strong> recovered 6.9p to 323.6p after Thursday's dip in the wake of a larger than expected drop in profits. Deutsche Bank raised its target from 350p to 370p following the figures, with a buy recommendation.</p> <p><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> was steady at 350.6p. The retailer has been in the doldrums since its recent trading update disappointed investors, with the exception of a burst of excitement early last week on renewed takeover speculation.</p> <p>But Morgan Stanley, which acts as the retailer's broker, believes the fall has been overdone. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> Whilst M&amp;S's first quarter trading update was poor, we think many commentators have over-reacted to it. We retain our equalweight rating for now, but would encourage investors to buy the shares on weakness. </blockquote> <p>It said M&amp;S's food business, which accounts for half its sales, was outperforming most of its quoted peers, while the clothing business, while struggling at the moment, had been gaining market share in recent years:</p> <blockquote> M&amp;S consensus earnings per share forecasts for 2012 are broadly in line with those when Marc Bolland took over as chief executive in May 2010 (despite the macro-economic situation having weakened significantly). </blockquote> <p>Reports that bankers were lining the retailer up as a \u00a36bn bid target after its recent decline put some life into the shares on Monday, although analysts were unconvinced by the tale.</p> <p>Still with retailers, <strong>Ocado</strong> dropped 2p to 71p after Panmure Gordon analyst Philip Dorgan said the online grocer might breach its covenants this year.</p> <p><strong>Dixons Retail </strong>rose 1.7% to 16.27p after it paid \u20ac10m to take full ownership of European online business Pixmania. It is buying the 22% held by the company's founders to take its shareholding to 99%, allowing it to full day to day control of the loss making business. The remaining 1% is held by staff. Pixmania supplies an e-merchant platform for Dixons as well as services to other businesses. Analyst Nick Bubb said:</p> <blockquote> Dixons says that this move will enable it \"to take the decisive actions necessary to improve Pixmania's performance\" (like closing it down?). </blockquote> <p>Kate Calvert at Seymour Pierce said:</p> <blockquote> Pixmania last year lost \u00a319.8m, and we are forecasting similar losses in the current year. We view this as a positive step as management needs to address the weak performance of Pixmania and its southern European businesses, though this will take time given the impact austerity measures are likely to have on consumer discretionary spending going forward. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Intertek</strong>, which supplies testing services for a range of products from toys to oil and minerals, added 6p to \u00a327.84 after Citigroup raised its price target from \u00a328 to \u00a331.5. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> Intertek offers the purest available exposure to global consumer testing's attractive economics. It also provides exposure to the [testing industry] consolidation story, where Intertek looks to be both acquirer and potential target. <br> As the smallest of the three testing operators, Intertek can still make a material impact on its equity value through mid-sized (\u00a3100m plus) deals, as demonstrated by 2011's acquisition of Moody International [for \u00a3450m]. </blockquote> <p>Finally, <strong>Flybe</strong> fell 15% to 64p after the regional airline cut its full year revenue target due to the weak consumer environment and high fuel prices.</p>",
  "<p>Standing at a crossroads, just on the edge of Aleppo on Tuesday, Abdul Rahman, his wife, mother, and three young children were carrying their possessions in plastic bags. They had covered the furniture inside their home in the nearby suburb of Sahor, locked the front door and started walking north.</p> <p>The family had no car and were hoping to find a minibus to take them to safety in Turkey. But neither the buses, nor much else, are working in Syria's second city anymore. And neither Abdul Rahman, a car mechanic, nor most of the residents that remain, have fuel, or the means to pay the exorbitant rates now being charged for the precious few litres available on the black market.</p> <p>As the roar of a warplane pierced the blue sky above, the family seemed to be resigned to their fate. \"I hope one of the farmers, or anyone else who still has fuel, will let us get on his truck,\" said Abdul Rahman as two of his children wept by the roadside. \"But look around, there is nothing moving.\"</p> <p>Towards the north, the drab grey fringes of the city gave way to pastures turned copper-toned by the sun and fruit orchards that seem to be begging for rain. To the west, down the road towards a main underpass into the central city, a heat haze shimmered above the baking black tarmac. The only vehicle visible was an upturned bus that had been looted and scorched when the siege of the city started around two weeks ago.</p> <p>Shops remain shuttered in most of eastern Aleppo. Rubbish continues to pile up by the day. A pervasive stench now hangs over the east of the city, a fetid mix of refuse, death and sewerage \u2013 it is difficult to distinguish between them anymore.</p> <p>The rumble of bombs and the scream of jets make another assault on the senses. On Tuesday morning, near a rebel position in the east of the capital, one of the jets approached fast and low. Its camouflage markings could easily be made out as it raced towards the rebel-held school house in its sight. So could the bombs attached to its underbelly.</p> <p>The jet roared across the top of the rebel base \u2013 a schoolyard, in which portraits of former dictator Hafez al-Assad lay smashed inside on the floor. It dropped its bomb \u2013 and missed, instead hitting a small adjoining home, killing a family of 10 and leaving a neighbourhood in despair.</p> <p>Those hours of anguish following the air strike offered one of the few glimpses into the mood of Aleppo at war. In the east of the city, once thriving market places come alive only in the hours before dusk. Workshops that line main roads are closed and footpaths eerily empty.</p> <p>The ancient citadel that towers above Aleppo's cultural and historic heart stands in defiance to the trouble all around. The medieval castle has seen revolution and war before, its stone walls seeing off the Byzantines, Greeks and Romans.</p> <p>But this popular uprising gives the feeling of breaking new ground. The uncompromising order of the four-decade Assad-family rule is now in play, and so too is the regional dynamic that has underpinned the regime since the fall of the Ottoman empire.</p> <p>Were Aleppo to fall it would almost certainly be followed by Damascus, amplifying the 1,500 schism between Shia Islam, whose leaders are backing the regime and the region's Sunnis, whom mostly oppose it. The instability now crippling Syria's two main cities could easily destabilise the neighbouring nation states that emerged from the ruins of empire and war 90 years ago.</p> <p>For now though, the battle in Aleppo is being fought in two halves. To the west of the citadel, past the old marketplace and the cobbled alleys around it, regime forces remain in effective control.</p> <p>\"They're beyond the wall of the castle,\" a young rebel from the Aleppo countryside said as he looked through the scope of his assault rifle. \"Go anywhere near them and a sniper will kill you.\"</p> <p>A maze of overpasses mark the battle lines for now. The road that snakes west along one overpass from the central suburb of Sarhor is barren and menacing. Across the crest of the hill is a regime checkpoint, the first of many in the west of the city, where life is reputedly easier than in the rebel-held east.</p> <p>It is difficult to gauge though; any reporter found by an official without a regime-issued visa for entering Syria would quickly experience life on the inside of the feared police state, the pillars of which are in an administrative district only two miles away.</p> <p>There, in the hub of state power, regime flags still fly above government buildings as they do from army positions and state institutions.</p> <p>The jets that haunt the skies in the other half of town are not heard here. Restaurants still serve the Aleppo establishment and commercial class, which has shown few signs of wavering in its support for the regime. And state media assures people that it will all be over soon.</p> <p>But the uprising has undeniably reached even the regime's staunchest supporters and penetrated its inner sanctums. \"They are scared over there,\" said a defector who escaped from the city's dreaded intelligence district on Thursday, motioning across the overpass. \"It is not a normal situation and people don't know who is going to win.</p> <p>\"The atmosphere is not normal. It has never been like this before.\"</p> <p>On Wednesday, rebel leaders in northern Aleppo insisted that they would soon be launching attacks against state buildings, particularly intelligence services. The attacks, they said, would serve two purposes; to remind the security network that it is no longer omnipotent \u2013 and to free many of the thousands of prisoners jailed in the buildings.</p> <p>Around noon yesterday, the first such attack was launched on a prison near central Aleppo. Rebels claim the two-hour fight for control of the facility led to the deaths of guards and freedom for many inmates, some of whom then quickly joined their ranks.</p> <p>To the south of the facility, smoke continued to billow above the suburb of Salahedin, which was a rebel stronghold until Thursday and is now a bombed-out wasteland.</p> <p>Elsewhere, in the east, the call to prayer from suburban mosques echoed across a vast and tired city. The holiest day of the week, in the third week of the month-long Ramadan fast, was largely sombre and silent.</p> <p>\"Maybe our victory will come after Eid [the three-day festival to mark the end of Ramadan]\", said Abu Nour, an Aleppo rebel whose unit was forced to flee Salahedin. \"I don't want to have to think too much about what will happen next. All I know is that what we are doing is right.\"</p> <p>As she helped neighbours pick through the ruins of the house bombed by jets, one woman didn't seem so sure. \"What have they done to Aleppo?\" she said. \"What are they doing to Syria. How will it end?\"</p>",

The second time, actually, if you count A Certain Ratio, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2010/sep/14/pop-group\" title=\"\">the Pop Group</a> et al, and you probably should. Like the Pop Group, the Other Tribe are from Bristol, although what they do is virtually the opposite to the former's dour funk noir \u2013 this is jubilant techno, with tribal percussion, ravey keyboards and rhythms and catchy topline melodies sung in a crazed falsetto by someone eager to convey the idea that there's a party going on right here, right now. They've been voted best live act in Bristol and we see no reason why they shouldn't become an enormous attraction in Britain's other major conurbations, and their appropriateness for festivals is quite uncanny.

People who weren't around to see, say, the Shamen, are talking excitedly about the way each track runs straight into the next at their gigs \"with the intensity you might expect from a techno DJ\", while the band themselves have declared their intention to \"emulate a DJ set while also being a live band\".

  "<p>Two days ago a tearful British team, denied their first Olympic final, had promised they would not come away from this Games with nothing. They made good on that here, beating New Zealand 3-1 in the bronze medal play-off to take only their second podium place in history, and their first in 20 years.</p> <p>It was a transformative performance from a team heartbroken by Argentina, and who had made no secret of their lofty ambitions at these Games. \"A gold medal was what we had spoken about for so many years and that was what it was about,\" said Crista Cullen, Britain's joint leading scorer in the tournament. \"But we picked each other up, put our arms round each other \u2026 We said we'd give every ounce of blood out there and that's what we showed today.\"</p> <p>The person who epitomises that spirit is Kate Walsh, their captain and their titanium woman. She had thought her tournament was over after her jaw was fractured in the very first game but, after surgery, she was told it would be stronger than ever. She proved the same of both her character and her team on Friday.</p> <p>They could not have appeared more different than the group which succumbed to Argentina. New Zealand had the first chance, Krystal Forgesson shooting wide after 10 minutes, but Walsh's team had repaired everything that looked broken on Wednesday. Their play was urgent, never hurried; they held on to possession in the midfield so tightly you would have thought they were gripping the medal itself. Alex Danson, who barely spied the ball against Argentina, was freed down the wing to do maximum damage.</p> <p>In the first half they did everything right but score. Hannah MacLeod forced her way through a melee of Kiwi bodies in the circle to win Britain's first penalty corner 14 minutes in, but Crista Cullen's shot was stopped by the keeper, Bianca Russell, and Cullen forced another chance wide. She remained unshaken. \"It was just a matter of time,\" said Cullen afterwards. \"We've got one of the best penalty corner routines here at this tournament. We just had to keep winning them.\"</p> <p>New Zealand took to the second half with more purpose, and Britain had a lucky break when Katie Glynn hit a post in the first minute. Walsh's women ramped up their defence and took some (literal) hard knocks. A crucial clearance from Helen Richardson ended a determined attack from Anita Punt, who had looked ready to run her down. New Zealand remained thwarted: it seemed that every time they ran the ball into the scoring area, Walsh would emerge nonchalantly with it a few seconds later.</p> <p>It was fitting that the captain should be at the centre of the two decisive moments of the game. Danson had made a run into the circle and forced a penalty corner from the Kiwi captain, Kayla Sharland, and it was Walsh who provided the flick for Danson to deflect in. The full-back ran to the halfway line with a warrior's cry.</p> <p>Six minutes later Britain faced their first penalty corner from New Zealand after losing an video appeal against it for dangerous play. As the shot came in, Walsh stood between the ball and the goal. She put her stick and every bit of her granite will in front of it, receiving a hefty blow to a hand with the kind of insouciance you would expect from a woman already playing with a restructured jaw. \"It was just the determination of not letting that ball go in,\" Walsh said later, when she could afford the smile. \"I wanted to win so bad \u2013 we all did.</p> <p>Britain did waste a couple of scoring opportunities, a four-on-two break that Sally Walton failed to capitalise on and a botched penalty corner from Cullen. But Cullen would not make the same mistake twice. With 12 minutes remaining, Ashleigh Ball received a ball from Danson in the circle and took on the keeper to win Britain's sixth penalty corner of the match. Cullen swept the ball in past the diving Russell and as the team thronged round her, they knew she had made victory certain. Another penalty corner goal four minutes later etched it in bronze.</p> <p>New Zealand, who had pushed Holland to a shootout in their semi, did manage a consolation goal and can comfort themselves that they achieved their highest-ever placing here \u2013 four years ago, they did not win a single game. But the real solace was for Britain's coach, Danny Kerry. He had been choked up after the semi-final defeat, and he was even more so here as he spoke of the mistakes he had corrected, and the individual transformation he had undergone, since his team's performance in Beijing.</p> <p>\"I'm just really content, that's how I feel,\" said Kerry, who revealed that he had undergone a process of personal analysis after receiving anonymous criticism from his team and staff at the Beijing Games. \"I was the classic coach who thought it was all about understanding hockey better than the opposition's coach, and I completely and utterly ignored the most important asset which is your players and your staff.</p> <p>\"You tend to hear about technique, tactics, training hard.

  "<h2>The ethical dilemma<br></h2> <p>Imagine you live in a country that practices the death penalty for child murder. Your client is arrested on suspicion of murdering a teenage boy. He is also suspected of the abduction and possible murder of two teenage girls from your neighbourhood. In the course of your first meeting he confesses to killing the boy. He also tells you that he has killed the two girls and hidden their bodies. He is hazy about how they were killed, but suggests each death was an accident. He draws you a map. He then instructs you not to disclose the location of the bodies unless prosecutors agree not to seek the death penalty. Are you able to offer to get your client to reveal the location if prosecutors undertake not to seek the death penalty? The police leak your negotiation strategy to the press. There is uproar. The father of one of the girls comes to see you to asks you to tell him where the body is. He says he will tell no one that you told him if you reveal the information. Can you tell him?

  "<p>In 1962, the writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/aug/08/edinburghfilmfestival2003.fiction\" title=\"\">Alexander Trocchi </a>complained that Scotland was \"turgid, petty, provincial\". It would be hard to make such a claim today, not as the Edinburgh festivals spark into full life this weekend. The fringe has already been under way for a week; on Saturday it is joined by the Edinburgh international festival and the Edinburgh international book festival. Over three weeks, cultural adventures range from the unveiling of <a href=\"http://www.edbookfest.co.uk/the-festival/whats-on/zadie-smith\" title=\"\">Zadie Smith's new novel</a> to Valery Gergiev's conducting the <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk/lso1\" title=\"\">complete Brahms symphonies </a>to a <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk/folespoir\" title=\"\">four-hour theatrical marathon </a>from a world-famous French company visiting the UK for the first time in 20 years.</p> <p>When Trocchi made his accusations \u2013 likening the nation's atmosphere to \"stale porridge\" \u2013 he was speaking at the 1962 Edinburgh writers' conference. That event launched the career of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/williamburroughs\" title=\"\">William Burroughs</a>, had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/jun/10/rebecca-west-forgotten-vorticist\" title=\"\">Rebecca West</a> suggesting that literary critics should be poisoned at birth, and saw writers almost come to blows: Trocchi claimed \"sodomy\" was the basis of his writing, while <a href=\"http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=1557\" title=\"\">poet Hugh MacDiarmid</a> denounced him as \"cosmopolitan scum\".</p> <p>This year's Edinburgh book festival is celebrating 50 years since that momentous conference by restaging it. This time it will be writers such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/alismith\" title=\"\">Ali Smith</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/ahdafsoueif\" title=\"\">Ahdaf Soueif</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/irvinewelsh\" title=\"\">Irvine Welsh</a> leading discussions on topics including the future of the novel and censorship \u2013 much the same issues, in fact, as were debated in 1962.</p> <p>According to Nick Barley, the book festival's director, \"the questions asked then remain as important now, if not more so. We seem to have reached a kind of endpoint in western culture and to be on the edge of something else, brought about by the information age and the global economic crisis. It's worth asking: what role will this strange 19th-century literary form called the novel play in this new age? Is it still relevant? Is the age of experiment and the avant-garde over? How does the novel relate to the world we live in \u2013 does it merely reflect the world or can it be a driver for change?\" He added: \"I won't promise fist fights, but if one or two people don't fall out I will be amazed.\" He said that he wanted the event to be in \"a new spirit of open and frank discussion\" \u2013 branching out from the book-festival formula of authors talking about their new books.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/09/nathan-englander-wins-frank-oconnor\" title=\"\">Nathan Englander</a>, author of this year's critically admired story collection <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/01/what-we-talk-anne-frank\" title=\"\">What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank</a>, who is to chair a session on style versus content, added: \"Novelists today are painfully supportive and there's hardly a vendetta between us, just a little occasional flaming on Twitter. Try as we might, we just can't drink as hard as they did in 1962. But if we manage a good fight, it will probably be about time.\"</p> <p>The Edinburgh international festival is branching out, too, experimenting with something the fringe does as a matter of course \u2013 popping up where audiences least expect it. Before its official launch, it has already unveiled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/aug/10/edinburgh-run-speed-of-light?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Speed of Light</a>, a vast community-created spectacle that crossbreeds hi-tech digital light show with land art. Employing 4,000 volunteer runners and walkers wearing digital lights, it is occupying one of the most dramatic spaces in the cityscape: Arthur's Seat, <a href=\"http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/arthurseat/geology/geology.html\" title=\"\">the craggy extinct volcano </a>that lours over Edinburgh. Fragments of the spectacle \u2013 resembling constellations forming or reforming, or sea creatures unspooling across the ocean floor \u2013 can be glimpsed from the city. But the best views are reserved for those who ascend the peak on one of the nightly guided walking tours.</p> <p>\"A festival is nothing but a pop-up, in a way,\" said Jonathan Mills, the director of the Edinburgh international festival. \"But we're trying to do it on a large scale with some of the finest, most important and innovative artists in the world. We're constantly asking ourselves what the festival can be, who it's for.\"</p> <p>Mills has spent nearly \u00a3500,000 constructing three temporary theatre spaces in an exhibition hall <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-18927634\" title=\"\">next to Edinburgh airport</a>. Audiences will be bussed out to experience spectacular shows including <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk/folespoir\" title=\"\">Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil's Naufrag\u00e9s du Fol Espoire</a>, four hours loosely based on a Jules Verne story, directed by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_Mnouchkine\" title=\"\">Ariane Mnouchkine</a>. There will be a cinematic version of <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk/macbeth\" title=\"\">Macbeth by the young Polish company TR Warszawa</a>, to be live-streamed on the Guardian website on Monday.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the fringe continues apace. Next week sees the premiere of Chris Goode's much anticipated play <a href=\"http://www.traverse.co.uk/whats-on/monkey-bars/\" title=\"\">Monkey Bars</a> at the Traverse Theatre, while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/aug/08/mies-julie-edinburgh-review\" title=\"\">Mies Julie</a>, the South African version of the Strindberg play that has become a real Edinburgh hit, continues at the Assembly Mound.</p> <p>One of the more avant-garde features of the fringe in recent years has been <a href=\"http://www.forestfringe.co.uk/paper-stages-edinburgh-2012/\" title=\"\">Forest Fringe</a>. Lacking a venue this year, it is launching a book tonight containing instructions for performances that readers can create themselves.</p> <p>For art lovers, a multi-site sound installation by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/video/2012/aug/09/olympics-2012-art-susan-philipsz-video?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Susan Philipsz</a>, the Turner-prizewinning artist, is responding to the sound of Edinburgh Castle's daily one o'clock gun, while the <a href=\"http://www.edinburghartfestival.com/exhibitions/the_fruitmarket_gallery/\" title=\"\">Fruitmarket gallery</a> is showing the diaries, full of paintings, poems and photographs, of the German artist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Roth\" title=\"\">Dieter Roth</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Britain is establishing official contacts for the first time with the Free Syrian Army and more than tripling its humanitarian and other non-lethal aid to opposition and human rights groups.</p> <p>The government has argued that the Syrian population could not wait indefinitely for a diplomatic solution to the conflict. The \u00a35m in aid will go to recipients inside Syria rather than the exile groups that the UK has funded until now.</p> <p>That shift of emphasis coupled with the dispatch this week of Jon Wilks, the UK's special envoy to the Syrian opposition, to Istanbul to make direct contacts with FSA representatives reflects a loss of patience with the diaspora-led Syrian National Council (SNC). It is a diverse umbrella group that western capitals hoped would become a strong and united voice of popular opposition to Bashar al-Assad's regime.</p> <p>The most recent attempt at unifying the group sponsored by the Arab League in Cairo last month, dissolved into chaos <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/03/us-syria-opposition-idUSBRE86213V20120703\" title=\"\">as fights broke out </a>and a Kurdish group walked out. The equally disparate anti-government militias fighting under the FSA banner also refused to accept political direction from the SNC.</p> <p>\"At the beginning, all of our efforts were focused on engaging with those who we could engage with quickly, and that meant the diaspora,\" an official said. \"But we always knew it would be important to engage with the local opposition. When we get to the end of the day, we know it won't just be the SNC sitting around the table. It will be people doing the legwork on the ground.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19205204\" title=\"\">Announcing the initiative</a>, the foreign secretary, William Hague said: \"Given the role that the Free Syrian Army is playing now in affairs in Syria, it is important to be in discussion with them, political discussion about the way forward and about the way in which they work with other opposition groupings ... So it's discussions about those sorts of things rather than military advice or tactics that we are discussing with the Free Syrian Army.\"</p> <p>Pointing to the impasse at the UN security council, Hague said: \"The people of Syria cannot wait indefinitely ... The Syrian people need urgent help, and today we are greatly increasing what we will do to support them.\" The new aid will go to NGOs and human rights monitoring groups. It will be in the form of communications equipment \"used to warn civilians of impending regime assaults\", training in documenting atrocities and upholding human rights. Hague said the UK had no intention of sending weapons to the FSA, saying: \"It would be hard to guarantee how [they] would be used.</p> <p>\"There have been reports of atrocities on the opposition side in Syria, which we condemn just as we condemn atrocities, the many atrocities carried out by the regime.\"</p> <p>A British official said that one of the main messages Wilks had taken to FSA representatives in Istanbul was to urge them to focus on their human rights obligations. \"It is important to send the message to the political arm of the FSA to say you have got responsibilities. We are saying: be careful, you are being watched very carefully.\"</p> <p>British officials said the FSA representatives they would talk to had been carefully vetted to ensure there was nobody with \"blood on their hands\". Some might have a military background but none would be currently involved in the fighting.</p> <p>Julien Barnes-Dacey, a Syria expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said: \"The British invested very heavily in the SNC for a long time and they gave them chance after chance to get their act together.</p> <p>\"But they have not been relevant for a long time, and the British have given up on them. That is a clear shift of the past few months.\"</p> <p>However, Barnes-Dacey was sceptical about whether Wilks would be able to find anyone in Istanbul who could be accurately be described as the political arm of the FSA.</p> <p>\"That is completely wishful thinking,\" he said. \"There is no such thing as the FSA in any organisational form, just different groups on the ground that identity themselves as the FSA.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Introduction</h2> <p>Eggbeaters at the ready? No, you clown, not the things you'd use to make a cake. In water polo, the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iifq9eF848U\">eggbeater</a> is a way of staying afloat by treading water. A team game developed by the English during the 19th century as an aquatic version of rugby, water polo used to be played informally in rivers and lakes. This stopped once it became common for players to injure themselves on submerged shopping trolleys. Possibly. The version of the game that survives today is closer to handball: a fast, tough and demanding sport, it has featured on every Olympic programme since the Paris 1900 Games.</p> <h2>The basics</h2> <p>In order to be able to swim constantly from one end of the pool to the other, seeking possession of the ball, you need to be physically fit and, of course, a confident, proficient swimmer. Teams consist of six players plus a goalie and its a prerequisite that a) you can't wear goggles \u2013 so get used to stinging eyes, and b) you have to wear a funny bonnet-like swimming cap which makes you look like Humpty Dumpty. Touching the bottom or sides of the pool is a foul. Most players use the aforementioned eggbeater kick (also used in synchronised swimming) rather than a scissor kick to tread water as it expends less energy and allows you to be more versatile in the water. The aim is simply to throw the ball into the goal and SCORE!</p> <p>Excitingly, for those who prefer a less exhausting form of the game, there's a version in which you float on an inner tube and play. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/apr/21/come-play-sport-social-club-london\">Read all about it here</a>.</p> <h2>Health benefits</h2> <p>This game is hard work and you have to be fit to take part in the first place \u2013 players can swim up to three miles during a match. You'll get a muscular and cardiovascular workout and experience the joys of team playing.</p> <h2>Equipment, costs and practicalities</h2> <p>If you want to play water polo you'll need to find a team by joining a club. Ask at your local leisure centre or swimming pool, or use a website like <a href=\"http://www.totallysporty.com/\">totallysporty.com</a> (London-based sports clubs), or search for the nearest pool with a water polo club on <a href=\"http://www.swimming.org/poolfinder\">swimming.org's website</a>. You could also try your local council's website. For example, <a href=\"http://www.leeds.gov.uk/Leisure_and_culture/Sports_clubs_and_centres/Sports__clubs_directory/Aquatics_clubs.aspx\">Leeds city council</a> has a section on local aquatics clubs that includes water polo.</p> <p>You'll have to pay club fees but they should be able to provide you with equipment and cover pool fees. Normal silicone swimming caps cost from about \u00a35, while if you want to order a customised batch for your team, complete with ear defenders, then you're looking at shelling out a couple of hundred quid. Other than that you'll need a cossie or some Speedos.</p> <h2>Trendiness rating: 6/10</h2> <p>The sport might be cooler if it took place at the local beach in California, rather than the local pool (and if all players looked like Baywatch actors).</p> <h2>Inside line</h2> <p><strong>David Richards, British Swimming:</strong> \"Water polo is an exciting and fast-paced game combining the skill and tactical elements of football with the aggression and physical contest of rugby. It's been officially recognised as one of the toughest sports in the world. Both men and women can take part at any level from beginners to elite, and if you're a student check out if your university has its own team. Anyone who wants to get involved should contact their local water polo club and attend a taster session or visit <a href=\"http://www.swimming.org/teamsports\">swimming.org/teamsports</a>.\"</p> <h2>Find out more</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.swimming.org/asa/regions\">swimming.org</a> \u2013 contact the ASA for regional clubs.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bwpl.org/\">bwpl.org/</a> \u2013 the website for the British Water Polo League.</p> <h2>You may also like</h2> <p>Synchronised swimming, handball.</p> <h2>You might hate</h2> <p>Fencing, BMX.</p> <h2>Over to you</h2> <p>Do you play water polo?

  "<h2>Frere-well</h2> <p>A West End institution began packing its bags this week, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/aug/06/blood-brothers-ends-west-end-run\" title=\"\">the announcement that Blood Brothers is to close at the Phoenix Theatre</a> in October after a run of more than 24 years and 100,000 performances. Willy Russell's musical \u2013 which started life in a Liverpool secondary school \u2013 is the third longest-running musical to ever grace London stages. (In case you're wondering, Les Miserables and The Phantom of the Opera are number one and two).</p> <p>While a quiet summer might have proved the final straw for Blood Brothers, things seem to be picking up a little for the rest of Theatreland <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/37000/west-end-rallies-but-takings-still-down-as\" title=\"\">after a slow start to the Olympic period</a>. Theatre managements say that bookings are now almost back up to normal summer levels.</p> <h2>Final curtain</h2> <p>Farewells of a sadder kind for Broadway musical theatre composers <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/36977/hairspray-writer-mark-odonnell-dies-aged-58\" title=\"\">Mark O'Donell</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/07/marvin-hamlisch-composer-dies?newsfeed=trues\" title=\"\">Marvin Hamlisch</a>, who both passed away this week. Hamlisch, who is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/07/marvin-hamlisch?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">best known for his Tony award-winning work on A Chorus Line</a>, was 68, while O'Donell who was co-writer on the stage musical of Hairspray, was only 58.</p> <h2>Tweet threat</h2> <p>In fact, it's not been a good week for Broadway, with the Longacre Theatre (currently hosting Mike Tyson's one-man show) <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/08/nyregion/after-court-order-twitter-sends-data-on-user-issuing-threats.html\" title=\"\">coming under threat from a Twitter user</a> who claimed they were going to bring a gun into the venue to shoot audiences. Twitter was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-19173659\" title=\"\">subpoenaed by the New York Police Department </a>and forced to give up the user's details. The show \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/us-news-blog/2012/aug/03/mike-tyson-broadway-debut\" title=\"\">Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth</a> \u2013 has continued undisturbed.</p> <h2>Direct whine</h2> <p>Back in the UK, actors are getting hot under their collective collar about high insurance premiums. Actors union Equity is <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/37005/actors-campaign-against-high-insurance\" title=\"\">encouraging its members to complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service</a> after receiving complaints from members that they were being made to pay punitively high rates, just because they were performers and therefore automatically considered high risk, despite the fact that insurers can provide to evidence to support their assumptions.</p> <h2>Curve bawl</h2> <p>Meanwhile, Leicester's Curve Theatre came under fire from a rather unlikely source. The city's elected mayor labelled the venue as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/aug/09/leicester-curve-theatre-disastrous-mayor?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">\"the most expensive and most disastrous project this city has ever seen in its history\"</a>. He was referring specifically to the amount the council overspent on the theatre <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/36975/leicester-mayor-criticises-council-overspend\" title=\"\">when it opened in 2008 at a cost of some \u00a360m</a>.</p> <h2>And finally...</h2> <p>A consummate lesson in how to lose friends and alienate people from an Edinburgh comedy promoter, who managed to lose bookings at two venues within the same week. Katie Yossarian had managed to secure a replacement venue for her charity comedy gig after being kicked out of the Acoustic Music Centre, but lost the second booking<a href=\"http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2012/08/06/15906/edinburgh_show_kicked_out_of_two_venues\" title=\"\"> after her new hosts read her blog</a> about the \"humourless bint at the Acoustic Centre\" who had kicked her out.

  "<h2>WE LIKE COMMUNITY. WE DON'T LIKE COMMUNITY SHIELD</h2> <p>Special Team GB underpants? Check. A to Z of Skegness? Check. Forty-eight cans of mood-enhancer? Check. Pele-endorsed pills? Shhh. The Fiver's off on holiday readers. Sunny Lincolnshire awaits. All the non-stop football and Big Games have worn this poor tea-timely email as thin as the lonely island on top of Alan Shearer's head. But what's this? (Fiver reverses its rusty Vauxhall Corsa back up its driveway and bangs head on steering wheel five, six, seven, eight, nine times). It's only the Community Shield this Sunday!</p> <p>\"Every time you play you want to win and this is the first chance for us to pick up a trophy in the new season. I'm as hungry as I have ever been, going into this season,\" burped Chelsea's Gary Cahill, who will likely start alongside England's Brave John Terry against Manchester City, if the Chelsea captain has finished hugging Big Cup and taking credit for things he has played no part in.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Chelsea boss Roberto Di Matteo has been busy this summer trying to iron out the wrinkles in his crinkly squad. Marko Marin, Oscar and humility's Eden Hazard have been brought in for a Uefa Financial Fair Play-busting \u00a364m. They are young, tricky upstarts who may make Chelsea worth watching again if not worth cancelling your Lincolnshire holiday for. The 19-year-old Thorgan Hazard, who has never played a competitive match and appears to have joined Chelsea just to make his older brother Eden \u2013 and perhaps even Fernando Torres \u2013 feel good about himself, has also arrived.</p> <p>What does this mean for Sunday's match? The Fiver doesn't know and doesn't care, but at least we've got past the three-par minimum limit to the bit where Manchester City players have to say something about the match at Villa Park. Yes Villa Park, not Wembley, readers. That's a real fact for you, right there. Big Games 1-0 Football.</p> <p>\"I have enjoyed the summer break and spending quality time with my family and managed to relax and recharge my batteries,\" said Manchester City's Yaya Toure, rubbing sand and the pleasant scent of summer breeze into the Fiver's face. \"I'm ready for the new season. There is a real spring in everyone's step and it's been great to catch up with the guys again.\"</p> <p>One man who isn't happy and relaxed is Roberto Mancini who, despite having spent more money than most small nations possess, is miffed that City have not added to a squad that won the Premier League title at a cost of around \u00a3500m. \"After four months, I don't know what to say. You need to ask Brian Marwood [the sporting director],\" he grumbled. \"I am not the sporting director. I can't say anything about players. I am not happy but I don't know what to say,\" he said, saying exactly what he wanted to say.</p> <p>Neither Mario Balotelli nor David Silva will play for City on Sunday. Both players have been allowed further time to rest and recuperate after busy summers. Sigh.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"Njoying twitter.com/LFC tonight. Istanbul 2005 \u2013 The Reds came back like true Warriors 2 be 5 time champs!

  "<p>One point that got mostly overlooked in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/aug/09/google-record-fine-ftc-safari\">Federal Trade Commission (FTC) fine against Google</a> - $22.5m, which would be a lot for you or me, but amounts to about 15 hours' operating profits based on the company's operating profits from its second quarter - was the dissenting opinion of one of the five commissioners, J Thomas Rosch, from the majority.</p> <p>(<strong>Update:</strong> Rosch has again dissented after the <a href=\"http://ftc.gov/opa/2012/08/facebook.shtm\">FTC settled with Facebook</a> over its altering of privacy settings. More in the piece below.)</p> <p>The commissioners split 4-1 in what they thought should be the correct way to treat Google over its behaviour. In fact, Rosch's dissent was so strong that the other four had to write an <a href=\"http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/c4336/120809googlestatement.pdf\">opinion</a> (PDF) explaining their reasoning.</p> <p>But first, here's Rosch's beef. In his <a href=\"http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/c4336/120809googleroschstatement.pdf\">minority opinion</a> (PDF), he says that he thinks that the FTC Act obliges him (and the others) </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>to determine whether there is both 'reason to believe' there is liability and whether the complaint is in the 'public interest' before we vote out any complaint, whether it be a litigation complaint or a consent decree.</p> </blockquote> <p>Clear enough so far? He's setting out what the ground rules are for deciding whether to vote on something: liability and public interest.</p> <p>Now it gets interesting. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is no question in my mind that there is \"reason to believe\" that Google is in contempt of a prior Commission order. However, I dissent from accepting this consent decree because it arguably cannot be concluded that the consent decree is in the public interest when it contains a denial of liability.</p> </blockquote> <p>That is: if Google won't agree that it is liable for what it has done, then Rosch doesn't think it should be let off with just a fine. In fact, he's really quite vexed (reading between the lines) at the fact that all Google does accept about the FTC is that it has jurisdiction, and that it's doing this in the right location: He points to the FTC Order (handing down the fine) which says \"[The] Defendant [Google] denies any violation of the FTC Order, any and all liability for the claims set forth in the Complaint, and all material allegations of the Complaint save for those regarding jurisdiction and venue.\" </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yet, at the very same time, the Commission supports a civil penalty of$22.5 million against Google for that very same conduct. Condoning a denial of liability in circumstances such as these is unprecedented.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also points out that Google has been charged before with \"engaging in deceptive conduct\" over Buzz, its social network which enrolled you whether or not you really wanted to be enrolled (much the same as Google+, in fact, though that seems to handle privacy rather better - so much better that nobody can tell how much of anything actually goes on there). Google, says Rosch, is essentially being charged with contempt of the FTC's Consent Order over Buzz - which is how it got into this whole thing.</p> <p>Says Rosch: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"This scenario \u2013 violation of a consent order \u2013 makes the Commission's acceptance of Google's denial of liability all the more inexplicable.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>He points out that $22.5m \"represents a de minimis amount of Google's profit or revenues.\" But it's even worse, he says: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"the Commission now has allowed liability to be denied not only in this matter but also in the Facebook settlement where Facebook simply promised to 'go and sin no more' (unlike Google, Facebook was not previously under order). There is nothing to prevent future respondents with fewer resources than Google and with lower profiles than Google and Facebook from denying liability in the future too.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And that's the real nub of Rosch's complaint with the mamjority decision: that if you let Google (and Facebook, which was also put under a consent order essentially for swapping around its privacy rules so often) off without admitting that what they did was wrong, then others will too. And if you <em>don't</em> do that, then it becomes one law for the big guys with <a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/23/under-scrutiny-google-spends-record-amount-on-lobbying/\">hefty lobbying operations</a>, and one law for the small ones.</p> <p>For complete clarity, I emailed the FTC on Thursday, and Commissioner Rosch's office responded to my queries as follows: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Commissioner Rosch doesn't think that the Commission has any business accepting a denial of liability when 1) Google sees fit to pay over $22 million in civil penalties; 2) Google is in clear contempt of a Commission order; and 3) there is no limiting principle, so that the acceptance of a denial of liability in this case represents a precedent for respondents less well-heeled and with a lower profile than Google to also negotiate a denial of liability. Commissioner Rosch notes that the FTC has a precedent here -- it is to allow defendants to \"neither admit nor deny\" liability. The Commission just didn't hold Google to that precedent in this case.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Update:</strong> in his <a href=\"http://ftc.gov/os/caselist/0923184/120810facebookstmtrosch.pdf\">Facebook dissenting opinion</a> (PDF), Rosch says: \"I cannot find that either the \"reason to believe\" or the \"in the interest of the public\" requirement is satisfied when, as here, there is an express denial of the allegations set forth in the complaint.\" So it's just as with Google: Rosch feels that companies should take responsibility for their actions (or inactions) - and wants the FTC to shift to a model like the Securities and Exchange Commission, where if you deny the charges then you can't be part of a consent order (essentially, getting you out of going to trial).</p> <p>There's certainly evidence that within the FTC, Google isn't exactly flavour of the month. In a call with reporters, David Vladeck, the director of the FTC's bureau of consumer protection, pointed to other privacy screwups by Google - Buzz, the Street View Wi-Fi data collection - and <a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/09/f-t-c-fines-google-22-5-million-for-safari-privacy-violations/?ref=technology\">said</a> \"The social contract has to be that if you're going to hold on to people's most private data, you have to do a better job of honoring your privacy commitments\". He wasn't impressed by Google's explanation that the cookie workaround was unintentional: \"As a regulator, it is hard to know which answer is worse: 'I didn't know' or 'I did it deliberately'.\" </p> <p>Google's statement, beyond which it's not shifting, is that \"We set the highest standards of privacy and security for our users.\" </p> <p>But if Rosch was the dissenter, why did the other four think it was OK to let Google off without admitting liability? Here's what they say: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Here, as in all cases, a defendant's denial of liability in a settlement agreement has no bearing on the Commission's determination as to whether it has reason to believe the defendant has violated the law or that a proposed settlement will afford appropriate relief for the Commission's charges. To the contrary, the Commission acts based on its consideration of the staff's investigative work, and in this instance we have strong reason to believe that Google violated its order.</p> </blockquote> <p>In other words: denying that you killed somebody doesn't cut much ice when you're found holding the knife still in their heart. (Or, less dramatically, denying you ever took those cookies isn't much use when you've been photographed on CCTV with your hand in the cookie jar.)</p> <p>The key question, the commissioners say, is whether Google will now abide by the consent order. The fine, they imply, is a big whack on the back of the hand for Google \"when the accompanying complaint does not allege that the conduct at issue yielded significant revenue or endured for a significant period of time.\" That's an important point, since there's absolutely no way of knowing how much revenue - if any - Google actually derived from what it did. </p> <p>Yet simple measures of revenue aren't the key point. What's really important, as Vladeck said, is whether we, as consumers, can trust companies with our data, because our data is becoming all that there is of us (and if you don't believe that, read again about how <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/\">technology writer Matt Honan had his digital life erased</a> by a couple of hackers who wanted access to his Twitter account).</p> <p>And after this fine, and with the EC still pondering whether it accepts <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jul/02/google-eu-antitrust-case\">Google's offerings to solve its antitrust questions</a> over search, and the FTC - them again - <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/apr/27/ftc-google-antitrust\">pondering the question of whether Google has abused its dominant position in search</a>, and with the Wi-Fi/Street View issue rumbling on in Europe (with the German data protection authorities considering what action to take, and now the UK's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jul/27/google-street-view-controversy\">Information Commissioner's Office doing a forensic examination of the data</a>), and with the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/aug/07/authors-damages-google-book-copyright\">Google Book scanning controversy</a> still rumbling on too, one wouldn't say that Google is out of the woods yet. Even if the FTC's fine represents less than a day's profits, the effects on its reputation could linger for a lot longer.</p>",
  "<p>This week's big news topic on the fanboy circuit has unearthed distressing memories for me of a certain A-list actor doing jaw-droppingly awful things to one of my most loved comic-book heroes as a kid: <a href=\"http://marvel.com/universe/Daredevil_%28Matthew_Murdock%29\" title=\"\">Daredevil</a>. Ben Affleck's turn as Marvel's blind, superpowered lawyer in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/94662/daredevil\" title=\"\">Mark Steven Johnson's 2003 film</a> may not have been the absolute low point of the actor's career \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/96687/gigli\" title=\"\">Gigli</a> and his smarmy appearance in the cringe-inducing video for then-ladyfriend Jennifer Lopez's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sob1LcGkdMg\" title=\"\">Jenny From the Block</a> would get my vote \u2013 but that preposterous purple leather gimp suit certainly helped land him in Hollywood purgatory for a few more years.</p> <p>Since then, Affleck has achieved a remarkable critical comeback, first by switching behind the camera to direct his brother Casey \u2013 at that time a far more malleable screen presence \u2013 in the grimy crime drama <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/120869/gone.baby.gone\" title=\"\">Gone Baby Gone</a>, then taking on directing and acting duties for the no-frills heist flick <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/137789/town\" title=\"\">The Town</a>. His next movie will be the Iran hostage crisis drama Argo, a potentially more highbrow project that might just do for Affleck what <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/110037/syriana\" title=\"\">Syriana</a> did <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqDbG9h-f7c\" title=\"\">for George Clooney in 2005</a> if it can muster a successful awards season run. After years in the wilderness, and more than a decade since he picked up a screenwriting Oscar for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/69596/good-will-hunting\" title=\"\">Good Will Hunting</a>, it seems to me that Affleck is approaching that kind of position once again.</p> <p>All of which makes Variety's suggestion this week that the actor-director is considering an offer to take charge of the new Justice League movie all the more dubious. The Hollywood trade bible says Affleck is the only film-maker to have seen the completed screenplay for the project (from Gangster Squad's Will Beall) and is expected to enter negotiations in the next few days. He is said to be seriously considering taking on a film which is being tipped as the DC response to Marvel's recent blockbuster megalith <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/144027/avengers\" title=\"\">The Avengers</a> and would feature Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman alongside more obscure figures such as the Flash and the Martian Manhunter. As if all that were not unlikely enough, <a href=\"http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118057612\" title=\"\">Variety also tips Affleck for an acting role as a member of the Justice League</a>, plunging him right back into Daredevil territory.</p> <p>The Clooney comparison holds together here too. Affleck's decision to get back in the spandex would be like Hollywood's favourite silver fox signing on to play a superhero once again despite his appalling experiences on Joel Schumacher's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/68388\" title=\"\">Batman and Robin</a>, the 1997 comic-book flick that <a href=\"http://www.dreammoviecast.com/casting-news/holy-cast-comparison-batman-george-clooney\" title=\"\">very nearly destroyed his career</a>. Rival Hollywood site <a href=\"http://www.deadline.com/2012/08/ben-affleck-on-justice-league-his-camp-says-no/\" title=\"\">Deadline has been quick to royally rubbish Variety's report</a>, and it's easy to see why.</p> <p>Despite Christopher Nolan's helpful decision to move big-screen Batman in a slightly more orthodox direction in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a>, with the addition of traditionally camp characters such as Catwoman and Robin, there is still a dramatic leap to be made before multiple superheroes can exist alongside each other in the Warner Bros/DC universe (as they do in Marvel's rival setup). Warner is absolutely right to plump for a youngish film-maker with a promising slate of movies and the vision and energy to create a new way of making superhero movies, but I cannot imagine Nolan having taken on Justice League a few years ago \u2013 when he was in that kind of slot \u2013 and Affleck would be crazy to go for it.</p> <p>Warner's thinking still seems to be muddled here too. It's all very well setting up an ensemble superhero flick in the DC universe, but Marvel Studios spent several years introducing characters such as Iron Man, Thor and Captain America in standalone films. By the time they appeared on screen together in The Avengers, most viewers were already aware of their individual backstories, and were able to accept them as rounded entities. There will not be time for a new Batman movie before Justice League arrives, and Nolan (in a \"godfather\" producing role alongside director Zack Snyder) has shown no sign of delivering an ensemble-friendly Superman in the upcoming <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148371/man-of-steel\" title=\"\">Man of Steel</a>, so whoever takes on the project will be working from scratch.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Justice League was a poisoned chalice five years ago when George Miller planned to direct it, and it remains so today. The only way I can imagine seeing the project manifest successfully on the big screen in the immediate future would be if it adopted a radically different format to recent films starring Batman and Superman, one which would help viewers see it as part of an alternate canon. Shooting entirely in highly stylised motion-captured CGI would be one way to go, but I have a feeling Hollywood won't do that. Myopically, it still sees animation as the preserve of children's movies.</p> <p>If Affleck does take a meeting with Warner Bros, I can only imagine it's because he has one eye on a rather more attractive prospect. Somebody has to reboot Batman in the next few years after Nolan signalled that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a> is his last film about the caped crusader. While anyone who has ever seen Daredevil might have their misgivings about that, the British director's stellar work in transforming the franchise into something that attracts awe rather than guffaws makes it a far more alluring proposition for an actor-director hoping to keep on the right side of the critics. Provided the gimp suit stays firmly locked away and no one digs out Clooney's Batnipples, such a prospect would not necessarily spell disaster.</p>",

  "<p>Targeting individuals who pose an imminent threat to the US is a lawful exercise of self-defense. But the current US targeted killing program \u2013 using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones) to strike terrorist operatives wherever we find them \u2013 raises a big red flag.</p> <p>This is not simply because the policy uses UAVs \u2013 remotely piloted combat aircraft are not inherently unlawful. Nor simply because of civilian deaths: although horrible and tragic, not all civilian deaths from military operations are unlawful. Nor simply because most strikes are in countries with whom we are not at war: states have a right to act in self-defense to protect their national security, even outside of armed conflict. Nor is it simply because intelligence personnel carry out many of the strikes: nothing in international law mandates that only military personnel can engage in combat. </p> <p>Although important, these critiques do not strike at the heart of the issue. It is the characterization of who we target and when \u2013 and how that determination is made \u2013 that raises serious questions of law and morality. In a nutshell: are we killing the right people?</p> <p>Effective counterterrorism requires the nation state to apply self-imposed restraint. Otherwise, violations of international law and morality are inevitable. How counterterrorism is carried out will determine its legality under governing international instruments.</p> <p>Among the many important international law principles applicable to targeted killing, the obligation of distinction sits at the pinnacle.&#xa0;The notion of counterterrorism as self-defense against imminent threats of harm means that the state <em>must know</em>, in a detailed manner, who poses such a threat, in what circumstances, and how and when such persons can be targeted. This information and analysis lies at the heart of the legitimate target determination.</p> <p>Decision-makers must then conduct the necessary proportionality analysis: will civilians be harmed and if so, how many? To minimize the number of innocent civilians killed during conflict, the attacking party must refrain from any attacks where the expected civilian casualties will be excessive in relation to the anticipated military gain.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/06/morality-drone-warfare-revisited\">Recent debates have highlighted questions regarding the justness of the US use of targeted strikes as a method of warfare</a>, focusing on the \"unmanned\" nature of the strikes. But just war concerns do not get to the heart of the issue. Similarly, there is little doubt that UAVs offer extraordinary accuracy and precision in targeting identified targets. Rather, the central issue is the accuracy in identifying those targets in the first place, and identifying those who will also suffer as a result of the attack if launched.</p> <p>Ultimately, the lawfulness of targeted killing depends, in large part, on the efficacy of the internal administrative measures adopted to identify targets and minimize civilian casualties. Only when those procedures are effective and discriminating will targeted killing be both legal and moral.</p> <p>Why? Because targeted killing is not about encountering a division of the enemy's forces on the battlefield and stopping it from advancing across the front towards your borders or essential infrastructure. That is the stuff of traditional conflict, of trench warfare and tank warfare and state versus state conflict. Instead, targeted killing rests on the specific identification of individuals who pose an imminent threat to the state's national security and are therefore legitimate targets within the framework of lawful self-defense. The state thus needs a method and a process for figuring out who poses a threat, why they pose a threat, and how that threat can be deterred or eliminated.</p> <p>The current US approach, however, is far too suggestive of \"guilt by association\" \u2013 targeting individuals whose involvement in terrorism is broadly defined, potentially without reliance on criteria, standards and limits. In a recent speech, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-us-yemen-20120809,0,4457664.story?track=rss&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+latimes%2Fnews%2Fnationworld%2Fworld+%28L.A.+Times+-+World+News%29&amp;utm_content=Netvibes\">President Obama's counterterrorism adviser, John Brennan, stated</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We are finding increasing recognition in the international community <em>that a more flexible understanding of \"imminence\" may be appropriate</em> when dealing with terrorist groups, in part because threats posed by non-state actors do not present themselves in the ways that evidenced imminence in more traditional conflicts.\" [Our italics.]</p> </blockquote> <p>Brennan's words \u2013 whoever his audience and whatever the purpose \u2013 drastically undermine American morality and commitment to the rule of law. A \"flexible understanding of imminence\" ultimately produces an approach that can only be defined as \"kill all the bad guys\". If everyone who constitutes \"a bad guy\" is automatically a legitimate target, then careful analysis of threats, imminence, proportionality, credibility, reliability and other factors simply goes out the window.</p> <p>Expansiveness and flexibility eliminate any sense of what is proportional, in the broadest sense of the term. If all threats are always imminent, then all responses are always proportionate. Self-defense becomes a mantra that justifies <em>all action</em>, regardless of method or procedure.</p> <p>Flexibility regarding imminence and threat-perception means that the identification of legitimate targets \u2013 the true essence of <em>moral</em> operational counterterrorism \u2013 becomes looser and less precise. In turn, expanded notions of legitimate target and the right of self-defense introduce greater flexibility with regard to collateral damage \u2013 both in terms of who constitutes collateral damage and how much collateral damage is justified in the course of targeting a particular threat.</p> <p>The result: flexibility plus the absence of criteria, process and procedure means that the notion of proportionality that should guide decision-making and operations ends up entirely out of proportion. In the high-stakes world of operational counterterrorism, there is no room for imprecision and casual definitions. The risks, to innocent civilians on both sides and to our fundamental values, are just too high.</p>",
  "<p>The Perseid meteor display is upon us. Over the course of the next four days, Earth will plough through the debris stream left by a giant comet that has been circling the sun since the birth of the solar system. </p> <p>Each tiny cometary fragment that hits our atmosphere is usually no larger than a speck of dust. Yet it burns up with an incandescent display that we call a shooting star. If you want to get technical about it: a meteor.</p> <p>This year, the Perseids will be visible from the northern hemisphere between 11 and 14 August. </p> <p>If the clouds cooperate and the skies are clear this weekend, the prime times to watch are generally between midnight and 3am. This year the night of the 12th going into the 13th is expected to be the best. But meteor showers are extremely variable and if you have the chance, watch in the early hours of any morning between the 11th and 14th.</p> <p>The direction in which to look is the east. If you know your constellations, find Perseus then look at its surroundings. Take a deck chair, blankets and a hot thermos to keep you company. Even in August, you will need the last two. Then wait. The expected rate of meteors this year is <a href=\"http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/astronomy/nightsky/nskyaug12.html\">a few dozen per hour</a>.</p> <p>Every Perseid you see was once in the tail of Comet Swift-Tuttle, a 27-kilometre-wide iceberg in space. It spends most of its time in the outer solar system, reaching beyond the orbit of Pluto. Then, every 133 years, it dives past the sun, replenishing the supply of Perseids.</p> <p>Swift-Tuttle, like all the comets, is in a constant state of disintegration. Comets hail from the outer solar system where icy compounds are easily maintained because it is so cold. As a comet approaches the sun, however, the heat melts the ice and solid grains of dust are released into space. This creates the ephemeral tails that are seen stretching across the night sky. </p> <p>As the tails disperse they create the debris streams that give us meteor showers. There are <a href=\"http://www.astro.amu.edu.pl/~jopek/MDC2007/index.php\">64 established meteor showers</a> that hit Earth every year and the Perseids are generally considered the best. </p> <p>And if you really want to impress your geeky friends, while simultaneously boring everybody else, ask them why meteors burn up in Earth's atmosphere. The chances are they will say friction. It's a popular misconception.</p> <p>Friction is caused when objects slide against one another. That is not the case for a meteor. When it hits the upper atmosphere it is travelling faster than 160,000 kilometres per hour (100,000 miles per hour). This compresses the air in front of it. When any gas is squeezed it naturally heats up. In this case the temperature reaches several thousand degrees, and this burns up the meteor. No sliding motion, no friction.</p> <p>As you're watching this weekend, spare a thought for the wonder of it all. Every single one of those meteors was born as the Earth was forming, about 4.5 billion years ago. That means each has a story to tell.</p> <p>By capturing the meteors before their demise, as the <a href=\"http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.html\">Stardust mission</a> did, we can begin to read the story of the birth of the solar system.</p> <h2>How to share your photos</h2> <p>Email a <strong>high-resolution jpeg or tiff photo file (maximum size 20MB)</strong> of this year's Perseids to <a href=\"mailto:your.photos@guardian.co.uk\">your.photos@guardian.co.uk</a> with \"Perseids meteor shower\" in the subject heading and a short description in the email of what you could see along with <strong>your name, location, and when the picture was taken</strong>.</p> <p>If you can fit it all in a tweet, you can also send your pictures to us via Twitter.

  "<p>If your pockets are feeling lighter these days, it isn't a one-off. Wages have fallen in real terms by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/06/squeezing-pay-prolong-uk-economic-pain\" title=\"\">7% over the last two years</a>, with the slide more rapid in the last nine months, as the UK economy has lurched into the second recession in five years.</p> <p>Nor is it an accident. Consider the meaning of recent government policies, encouraging the spread of free or low-wage labour. This week, it was reported that a call centre is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/08/prisoners-call-centre-fired-staff\" title=\"\">making use of prison labour</a> for the bargain price of \u00a33 a day per worker. The arrangement, part of a government work experience scheme, meant that workers on the normal pay scale were sacked.</p> <p>Likewise, the government's back-to-work schemes have led to unemployed workers being put to do jobs. The high court has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/aug/06/unpaid-work-scheme-ruled-lawful-poundland\" title=\"\">ruled that this scheme does not amount to forced labour</a>. However, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/06/unpaid-work-scheme-benefits-rebate\" title=\"\">letters sent by the Department of Work and Pensions</a> clearly led unemployed workers to believe the scheme was mandatory. As a result, not only have many people been forced off the welfare rolls, but many others have been forced into work for which the company pays nothing. Once again, part of the controversy about this scheme is that workers on the normal pay scale have tended to lose their jobs.</p> <p>The pattern is for the government to offer already low-paying employers the opportunity to jack up their profit rate. Earlier this year, it was revealed that jobseekers were being forced to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/feb/24/jobseekers-unpaid-work-placements\" title=\"\">carry out unpaid cleaning work</a> for the government contractor Avanta. The government claimed it was for \"community benefit\", but it was disclosed that \"under government rules, this can be defined as increasing the profit of organisations where the unemployed are sent to work without pay\".</p> <p>Obviously, this has nothing to do with boosting employment. As a number of trade union leaders have pointed out, this does <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/08/workfare-schemes-bad-for-all\" title=\"\">nothing to incentivise recruitment at normal pay and conditions</a>. One of the intended effects of workfare is to reduce the number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance.</p> <p>Iain Duncan Smith has been explicit about his desire to cut the numbers claiming benefits. He has already gloated that workfare and other cuts are driving people off the benefit rolls. He would like to give the impression that they are returning to employment, but we know from the statistics that this is unlikely to be the case. Insofar as there is any increase in employment lately, it has been in the number of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/comment/david-blanchflower/david-blanchflower-wages-slide-shows-bank-must-act-strongly-and-quickly-7879797.html\" title=\"\">self-employed people</a>. This is always a sure sign of an increasingly precarious existence. Just as the unemployed in the Victorian era spent their time desperately seeking errands to run, traders to serve, sundry items to sell, so today the self-employed can be found patching together a living from the flotsam of urban capitalism.</p> <p>The effects of such policies are much wider, however, than those immediately affected. A key theme of Tory ideology is the market, and its disciplines. Precarity is, from a certain perspective, a wonderful whip to hold over labour, to maintain its compliance and keep its demands to a minimum. This effect is peculiarly acute for those who are already low paid and insecure.</p> <p>Taken together with the cuts to public sector pay and welfare, the overall effect of government policy is a sustained assault on income and living standards. George Osborne explained the logic in a <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120517/debtext/120517-0002.htm\" title=\"\">parliamentary speech in May</a>. The government has a free hand to attack uncompetitive labour markets and welfare systems, as it can rely on quantitative easing and other monetary solutions to sustain UK demand while wages fall. The Tories believe that if they further hammer the cost of labour, businesses will start to invest again. Meanwhile, demand for British goods would be found overseas \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/01/uk-manufacturing-figures-blow-to-recovery?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">fabled \"export-led recovery\"</a>.</p> <p>If this is unlikely to restore growth, it will accentuate the marked tendency of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/25/unpaid-overtime-free-labour-flexible\" title=\"\">labour's share of income to decline</a> over the years and increase profit margins. However, the scale of what the government would like to accomplish is likely to far exceed what it can accomplish. Despite the high court's ruling, most visible brand name businesses in the UK have already <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2012/02/scheme-greggs-grayling\" title=\"\">dropped the Tories and their scheme</a> under pressure from a relatively small coalition of campaigners.</p> <p>The major problem for the Tories, though, is that targeting prisoners and jobseekers is a poor substitute for the main goal of weakening trade union organisation. In the public sector, and in private sector areas such as transport and energy, unions retain some strength. Thatcher began the job of dismantling union power, but she did not complete it. This is the major counter-tendency to falling wages in the economy and potentially the major obstacle to the Tories' radical structural adjustment plans. As is often the case, the fate of the most vulnerable workers depends on the actions of those who are best organised.</p>",
  "<p>With just two days of competition left, most of the medals have already been handed out. So the time has come for the Armchair Athlete to award a few of his own for those events that weren't in the original schedule, but which have become every bit as closely fought and entertaining for those of us left watching the Olympics from the living room sofa.</p> <h2>Biggest moaners</h2> <p>Britain's smile has been just that bit wider these past two weeks as the failures and the gripings of our three most bitter rivals has made our own success all the sweeter. After snatching the Olympics from under French noses in 2005, the Brits have outclassed the French everywhere apart from the swimming pool. Especially the velodrome, where the French team accused us of having magic wheels \u2026 wheels that just happened to be made in France. The Aussies and Germans have also badly underperformed, with their home team fans and media turning on them and calling them chokers. Life doesn't get much better.</p> <p>Gold: France</p> <p>Silver: Australia</p> <p>Bronze: Germany</p> <h2>Britain's greatest Olympian</h2> <p>Before the games, there was only one candidate: Sir Steve Redgrave with his five rowing gold medals. After Bradley Wiggins won gold for the time trial on the first Wednesday, the BBC decided a little recalibration was required and Wiggo was elevated above Redgrave on the grounds that he had won the most medals in total \u2013 four gold, two silver, one bronze - and declared him Britain's greatest ever Olympian. After Sir Chris Hoy had taken his sixth gold, who did the BBC call on to pass over the mantle of Britain's greatest Olympian? None other than Sir Steve.</p> <p>Gold: Sir Chris Hoy</p> <p>Silver: Sir Steve Redgrave or Bradley Wiggins</p> <p>Bronze: Sir Steve Redgrave or Bradley Wiggins</p> <h2>Most predictable exit</h2> <p>Unfortunately, the men's and women's sprint relay teams have yet to compete, so there is still some \u2013 if not much \u2013 doubt about their failure to pass the baton round the whole track. But even if they do drop it again, there was nothing less unexpected than the GB football team going out on penalties in the quarter-final. They would lose to the Marshall Islands on penalties if they played them. Nearly as inevitable was that Jonas Hoegh-Christensen would lose the medal race in the Finn sailing class, despite having led throughout the competition. No one beats Ben Ainslie. And the whole world experienced deja vu as Chinese hurdler Liu Xiang pulled up injured for the second Games in succession.</p> <p>Gold: GB football team</p> <p>Silver: Jonas Hoegh-Christensen</p> <p>Bronze: Liu Xiang</p> <h2>Rarest sighting</h2> <p>You would have had to know your athletics history to know that Seb Coe's greatest rival on the track was Steve Ovett, as the Brighton-born runner has been almost entirely airbrushed out of these Games. These are Lord Coe's Olympics and nothing is going to spoil them. While Typhoid Dave and Bozza have been piggy-backing on Team GB's success at every opportunity, Ed Miliband has gone to ground. Nick Clegg probably wishes he had too, as he was booed at the hockey. There have been a few mentions of Linford Christie in the commentary team, but no pictures. He remains unforgiven by the BBC for a failed drug test late in his career.</p> <p>Gold: Steve Ovett</p> <p>Silver: Ed Miliband</p> <p>Bronze: Linford Christie</p> <h2>Best groper</h2> <p>This has been the Games when the commentators have gone <em>mano a mano</em> with one another to grab chunks out of any passing athlete. Jake Humphrey made a late surge by snogging Mark Cavendish, and John \"Fingers\" Inverdale would have been a cert for top podium spot if he hadn't been taken away from the rowing and put out of harm's reach, anchoring the BBC's coverage from the Olympic Stadium. So Phil \"Roving Hands\" Jones was left to win at a canter as he pawed any unsuspecting athletes moments after they had crossed the finishing line.</p> <p>Gold: Phil \"Roving Hands\" Jones</p> <p>Silver: John \"Fingers\" Inverdale</p> <p>Bronze: Jake \"The Tongue\" Humphrey</p> <h2>Worst uniforms</h2> <p>One of the clearest winners. One look at the Russian tracksuits was enough to induce a migraine, and if the Russians want to conduct a postmortem on why their medal tally has been down on expectations, they could do worse than start there. Team GB might also want to examine whether its sluggish start to the Games was precipitated by the truly hideous uniforms they were made to wear for the opening ceremony. Not even Robbie Savage wants to look like Robbie Savage in Strictly Come Dancing. We also expected something rather more stylish of the Spanish.</p> <p>Gold: Russia</p> <p>Silver: Great Britain</p> <p>Bronze: Spain</p> <h2>Britain's already forgotten gold medallists</h2> <p>When Heather Stanning and Helen Glover won Britain's first gold medal of the Games in the coxless pairs after an anxious four days with nothing much to celebrate, they were hailed as Britain's saviours by John Inverdale and Clare Balding. Now they'd be lucky to be recognised in the street \u2013 though their fame lasted rather longer than that of British shooter Peter Wilson's 30 seconds. And you have to feel for Greg Rutherford, whose long jump gold was totally eclipsed by Jess Ennis and Mo Farah on the same night.</p> <p>Gold: That bloke who won the shooting</p> <p>Silver: Those women in the rowing</p> <p>Bronze: The long jumper</p> <h2>Best parents</h2> <p>Sir Chris Hoy's parents rarely miss any of their son's competitions and they did more than their fair share of nail biting and hiding their faces. But they were the epitome of reserve compared with Lynn and Rick Raisman, who lived every second of their daughter Aly's bar routine in the gymnastics. Even so, the winner \u2013 by the length of the home straight \u2013 was South African swimmer Chad Le Clos's father Bert, for his interview with Clare Balding. \"What a beautiful boy! I've died and gone to heaven.\"</p> <p>Gold: Bert Le Clos</p> <p>Silver: Lynn and Rick Raisman</p> <p>Bronze: Carol and David Hoy</p> <h2>Best pundit</h2> <p>The clear favourite going into the Games was Michael Johnson, who always manages to sound more intelligent and informed than anyone else around him. But while still far better than most others, Johnson has been a bit low on energy this time round and has sometimes appeared as if he wished he wasn't being asked to fill dead airtime with the same guff he said half an hour ago. The slow start by the US to the track and field events seemed to have made him grumpy. Mark Cavendish, meanwhile, was a revelation at the velodrome; funny, knowledgeable, honest and up for the craic. Ian Thorpe was always worth watching, if only for his costume changes.</p> <p>Gold: Mark Cavendish</p> <p>Silver: Michael Johnson</p> <p>Bronze: Ian Thorpe</p> <h2>Worst music</h2> <p>There can't be anyone left in the world who can bear to listen to Let Me Entertain You, We Will Rock You and We are the Champions ever again, such has been the frequency with which they are played during any lull in competition. And sometimes during it. Still, it was preferable to the Benny Hill theme tune that accompanied the women's beach volleyball. We didn't need reminding that it was a sport included primarily for the perve factor. It also encouraged the commentators to call all women athletes \"girls\". Not that they needed much encouraging. But the outright winner is Paul McCartney for his performances at the opening ceremony and in the velodrome.</p> <p>Gold: Sir Paul McCartney</p> <p>Silver: Benny Hill</p> <p>Bronze: Robbie Williams and Queen</p> <h2>Best self-publicist</h2> <p>From \"accidentally\" getting stuck on a zip wire, to being \"caught on camera\" at every venue, to muscling in on the political agenda - \"Everyone should do two hours sport a day at school like me. Look what it did for me.\" Hmm. Boris Johnson has effortlessly mastered the art of being in several locations at the same time and taking the credit for everything on offer. If you didn't get to a live event, it's because Bozza hogged your ticket.</p> <p>Gold: Boris Johnson</p> <p>Silver: Boris Johnson</p> <p>Bronze: Boris Johnson</p> <h2>Biggest sponsorship own goals</h2> <p>\"We are proud to only take Visa\" was written large over every Olympic retail outlet. Most visitors were totally underwhelmed to be massively inconvenienced and find that their non-Visa credit cards weren't accepted, and will now go out of their way to ensure they never use Visa again. I don't know how much Adidas paid \u2013 with Visa, presumably \u2013 to be an official sponsor, but it wasn't worth it. Everyone came away thinking that it was Nike's Games.

This sparked yet more tears from John \"Fingers\" Inverdale, who broke down himself after hugging them. For once Sir Chris Hoy didn't make it to the top of the podium, while Vicky Pendleton was disqualified \u2013 her third DQ of the Games \u2013 on the grounds that she's got \"magic tears\" that seldom stop flowing and therefore has an unfair advantage.</p> <p>Gold: Mark Hunter and Zac Purchase</p> <p>Silver: John \"Fingers\" Inverdale</p> <p>Bronze: Sir Chris Hoy</p>",
  "<p>A second candidate for the job of police and crime commissioner has been forced to withdraw his application because of a minor offence he was convicted of 47 years ago at 14.</p> <p>Alan Charles, Labour's PCC candidate in Derbyshire, who has been vice-chairman of the Derbyshire police authority for the last three years, said on Friday he had made \"the difficult decision\" after receiving clarification from the Home Office and Electoral Commission that juvenile convictions for offences that carry a prison sentence if committed by an adult bar candidates.</p> <p>\"Despite serving as a councillor for over 20 years and as vice-chair of Derbyshire police authority, I have received confirmation that a minor criminal offence I committed as a 14-year-old around 47 years ago, for which I was given a conditional discharge, has now barred me from standing for the PCC post.\"</p> <p>Charles, who is the deputy leader of the Labour group on Derbyshire county council, told the Guardian he could not even remember the precise details of the charge for the non-violent offence he faced in 1965, but he had declared it to the local force when he was vetted three years ago. The chief constable has since been happy to share sensitive information with him.</p> <p>\"It was dealt with at the time and went through the judicial process. If it happened today it would probably be resolved through a restorative justice process. The bizarre thing is that you can be prime minister, home secretary, or the police minister or a member of the House of Lords but not a police commissioner candidate,\" he said, adding that there was no record of his conviction on police databases.</p> <p>The first casualty of the stringent criminal record test in the paving legislation for the elections this November was Bob Ashford, Labour's candidate in Avon and Somerset, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/08/bob-ashford-labour-police-commissioner\" title=\"\">had to stand down</a> on Wednesday because of a minor offence he committed when he was 13 in 1966.</p> <p>The disclosure comes as a cross-party group of magistrates, who are also police commissioner candidates, prepares to launch a high court challenge to Thursday's disclosure of a ruling by the senior presiding judge in England and Wales that they must <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/09/magistrates-banned-police-commissioner-elections\" title=\"\">resign as magistrates or stand down as candidates</a>.</p> <p>Four official PCC candidates, including the Conservatives standing in Kent and Surrey, wrote to Lord Justice Goldring challenging his ruling. The letter, organised by Mervyn Barrett, an independent candidate in Lincolnshire, accused the senior presiding judge of \"usurping the role of parliament\" in issuing what amounts to a directive, and doing it without consultation.</p> <p>\"Should your lordship feel unable to meet with us or reconsider your decision we will be left with no choice but to urgently consider whether or not to seek permission to challenge your decision by way of an expedited judicial review,\" the candidates wrote.</p> <p>Jon Collins, deputy director of the Police Foundation thinktank, said Charles's decision was extremely disappointing. \"It surely cannot be right that a minor offence committed nearly 50 years ago should prevent an otherwise qualified candidate from standing for election as a PCC. There is hardly a surfeit of capable candidates putting themselves forward for these elections and the law that bars anybody who has committed an imprisonable offence is misguided and unfair,\" Collins said.</p> <p>\"It is too late to correct this unfortunate situation ahead of November's election without causing further chaos. However, all political parties should admit that they got this wrong and commit to ensuring that this unfair piece of legislation is changed in time for the next round of PCC elections.\"</p> <p>But the Home Office said in a statement on Wednesday that such a high standard had been set with cross-party agreement because the PCCs will hold police forces, whose duty is to uphold the law, to account.</p> <p>\"The Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 disqualifies a person from standing for election as a PCC if they have at any time been convicted of an offence for which a person could be sent to prison; whether or not they themselves were sent to prison for that offence,\" it said.</p>",
  "<p>I am one of the lead plaintiffs in the civil lawsuit against the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/jan/02/ndaa-historic-assault-american-liberty\">National Defense Authorization Act, which gives the president the power</a> to hold any US citizen anywhere for as long as he wants, without charge or trial.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/18/local/la-me-gs-national-defense-authorization-ruling-20120518\">May hearing, Judge Katherine Forrest issued an injunction against it</a>; this week, in a final hearing in New York City, <a href=\"http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/08/ndaa_suit_argue.php\">US government lawyers asserted even more extreme powers</a> \u2013 the right to disregard entirely the judge and the law. On Monday 6 August, <a href=\"http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/item/12390-obama-admin-files-appeal-of-ndaa-injunction\">Obama's lawyers filed an appeal to the injunction</a> \u2013 a profoundly important development that, as of this writing, has been scarcely reported.</p> <p>In the earlier March hearing, US government lawyers had confirmed that, yes, the NDAA does give the president the power to lock up people like journalist Chris Hedges and peaceful activists like myself and other plaintiffs. Government attorneys stated on record that even war correspondents could be locked up indefinitely under the NDAA.</p> <p>Judge Forrest had ruled for a temporary injunction against an unconstitutional provision in this law, after government attorneys refused to provide assurances to the court that plaintiffs and others would not be indefinitely detained <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/17/ndaa-section-1021-coup-detat-foiled\">for engaging in first amendment activities</a>. At that time, twice the government has refused to define what it means to be an \"associated force\", and it claimed the right to refrain from offering any clear definition of this term, or clear boundaries of power under this law.</p> <p>This past week's hearing was even more terrifying. Government attorneys again, in this hearing, presented no evidence to support their position and brought forth no witnesses. Most incredibly, Obama's attorneys refused to assure the court, when questioned, that the NDAA's section 1021 \u2013 the provision that permits reporters and others who have not committed crimes to be detained without trial \u2013 has not been applied by the US government anywhere in the world <em>after</em> Judge Forrest's injunction. In other words, they were telling a US federal judge that they could not, or would not, state whether Obama's government had complied with the legal injunction that she had laid down before them.</p> <p>To this, <a href=\"http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/08/08/49107.htm\">Judge Forrest responded</a> that if the provision had indeed been applied, the United States government would be in contempt of court.</p> <p>I have mixed feelings about suing my government, and in particular, my president, over the National Defense Authorization Act. I voted for Obama.</p> <p>But the US public often ignores how, when it comes to the \"war on terror\", the US government as a whole has been deceitful, reckless, even murderous. We lost nearly 3,000 people on 9/11. Then we allowed the Bush administration to lie and force us into war with a country that had <em>nothing</em> to do with that terrible day. Presidents Bush and Obama, and the US Congress, appear more interested in enacting misguided \"war on terror\" policies that distract citizens from investigating the truth about what we've done, and what we've become, since 9/11.</p> <p>I, like many in this fight, am now afraid of my government. We have good reason to be. Due to the NDAA, Chris Hedges, Kai Wargalla, the other plaintiffs and I are squarely in the crosshairs of a \"war on terror\" that has been an excuse to undermine liberties, trample the US constitution, destroy mechanisms of accountability and transparency, and cause irreparable harm to millions. Several of my co-plaintiffs know well the harassment and harm they have incurred from having dared openly to defy the US government: court testimony has included government subpoenas of private bank records of Icelandic parliamentarian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/birgitta-j-nsd-ttir\">Birgitta J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir</a>; Wargalla's account of having been listed as a \"terrorist group\"; and Hedges' concern that he would be included as a \"belligerent\" in the NDAA's definition of the term \u2013 because he interviews members of outlawed groups as a reporter \u2013 a concern that the US attorneys refused on the record to allay.</p> <p>Other advocates have had email accounts repeatedly hacked, and often find their electronic communications corrupted in transmission (some emails vanish altogether). This is an increasing form of pressure that supporters of state surveillance and intervention in the internet often fail to consider.</p> <p>I've been surprised to find that most people, when I mention that I am suing my president, Leon Panetta, and six members of Congress (four Democrats and four Republicans), thank me \u2013 even before I explain what I'm suing them over! And when I do explain the fact that I and my seven co-plaintiffs are suing over a law that suspends due process, threatens first amendment rights and takes away the basic right of every citizen on this planet not to be indefinitely detained without charge or trial, their exuberance shifts, and a deeper gratitude shines through newly somber demeanors. But this fight has taken a personal toll on many of us, including myself.</p> <p>My government, meanwhile, seems to have lost the ability to discern the truth about the US constitution any more; I and many others have not. We are fighting for due process and for the first amendment \u2013 for a country we still believe in and for a government still legally bound by its constitution.</p> <p>If that makes us their \"enemies\", then so be it. As long as they cannot call us \"belligerents\", lock us up and throw away the key \u2013 a power that, incredibly, this past week US government lawyers still asserted is their right. Against such abuses, we will keep fighting.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was commissioned by the <a href=\"http://dailycloudt.com/voice/358/us-attorneys-refuse-to-assure-judge-that-they-are-not-already-detaining-citizens-under-ndaa\">Daily Cloudt</a> and appears here by permission of the editors</p> <p>\u2022 Editor's note: the article originally stated that the administration lawyers filed an appeal against the injunction on 9 August; this was amended to 6 August on 10 August, at 1pm ET</p>",

  "<p>I think I'm right in saying there was more media coverage this week of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/aug/08/rioters-notting-hill-ledbury-jailed\" title=\"\">the sentencing of the \"Notting Hill mob\", </a>which rampaged through a fashionable London restaurant and shops during the August 2011 riots, than there was of the anniversary of the riots themselves. That's puzzling, isn't it?</p> <p>All right, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/aug/03/mark-duggan-mother-waiting-answers\" title=\"\">first anniversary of the shooting of Mark Duggan</a> in Tottenham on 4 August, and the rioting that spread through parts of London and other cities two nights later, coincided and contrasted with the surge of enthusiasm for the London Olympics, its growing success and the parallel achievements of Team GB.</p> <p>Both took many people by surprise, not just those in authority, but ordinary citizens \u2013 horrified last summer, thrilled this one. Even the abysmal weather since early April has relented enough to retain only a bit-part in the collective Olympic memory, which (we hope) will sustain a warm glow through hard times. Wonderful!</p> <p>But surely none of that can explain the extent to which the riots were blanked in many places you'd expect them not to be.</p> <p>The Guardian carried an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/interactive/2011/dec/14/reading-the-riots-investigating-england-s-summer-of-disorder-full-report\" title=\"\">extensive series of reports</a> based on LSE-conducted interviews with rioters \u2013 and took a lot of stick when they blamed the police. Likewise the Observer, the Mail (lots of convicted offenders have reoffended!) and the Sunday Telegraph \u2013 which reported that, one year on, a lot of victims are still waiting for compensation from an inefficient and careless bureaucracy \u2013 carried reports.</p> <p>There's been a lot of talk about the Olympic legacy, but we have a riot legacy to deal with. Perhaps there was a blockbuster on the TV that I missed or in one of the political magazines I no longer monitor as I should. Overall I think we've chosen to look the other way.</p> <p>There is a positive case to be made for doing so. In <a href=\"http://video.msnbc.msn.com/nbc-news/48550953/\" title=\"\">one bit of film </a>I found \u2013 an NBC News report contrasting London's two Augusts \u2013 the Reeves family, who lost their five-generation furniture store in Croydon to an arsonist (since jailed), chose to stress the help they had received from the community and the efforts they are making to pay it back.</p> <p>Their surviving store is plastered with upbeat notes this week and Maurice Reeves, 81, told the TV crew how good the feeling had been when the Olympic torch passed through the south London suburb. Corny, I know, but corny is often good. Someone called it \"reverse rioting\".</p> <p>When I contacted a political chum in north London he said basically the same thing. Tottenham was cleaned up within days \u2013 only the stench of smoke and boarded-up buildings remained \u2013 but reputational damage was still hurting it and its retail businesses, he said. Perhaps the Olympics were a helpful distraction. Even cranky David Starkey wrote of \"blessed amnesia\".</p> <p>Another reason for forgetfulness is that the government decided not to follow the instant inquiry route of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981_Brixton_riot\" title=\"\">1981 Brixton riots</a>, after which a very weighty judge, Lord Scarman, delivered the scathing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarman_report\" title=\"\">Scarman report</a>. It highlighted \"complex political, social and economic factors\", not least heavy-handed use of police stop and search powers, and urged Margaret Thatcher's ministers to act to improve conditions and confidence in the police.</p> <p>These were the days when Willie Whitelaw, an old-school liberal Tory, was home secretary and some steps were taken to reform the Met and police procedures. A new stress on community relations (rather than race relations) emerged from the rubble.</p> <p>But this quote from Scarman could apply to an analysis today: \"Without close parental support, with no job to go to, and with few recreational facilities available the young black person makes his life the streets and the seedy, commercially run clubs of Brixton. There he meets criminals, who appear to have no difficulty obtaining the benefits of a materialist society.\"</p> <p>A lot of that sounds ominously familiar, doesn't it? Sharon Grant, widow of Bernie Grant, the Tottenham MP, told the BBC that stop and search rates in her area have halved, but that a lot of promises remain unfulfilled. The communications mechanism between police and locals, which broke down so disastrously between Duggan's death and the start of the riots, is still not repaired or improved, she said. Stafford Scott <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/03/mark-duggan-lessons-police-learned\" title=\"\">says similar things</a>.</p> <p>Indeed not. Duggan's family have still not been told exactly how he came to be shot by a police officer while being tailed as part of an anti-gun-crime operation. That's pretty shocking and gives some justification to claims routinely made \u2013 often rather too casually \u2013 that it could all happen again, only worse.</p> <p>Acpo, the chief police officers' organisation, says it doesn't have \"a standing army\" to deal with disorder on this scale, as some countries, including France, have. The CRS riot police, hanging menacingly around in lorries at sensitive junctions, have been a sight in Paris for as long as I can remember. Were they there before the 1968 riots? I can't recall.</p> <p>That doesn't mean that the police response \u2013 better in Manchester and Birmingham than in London \u2013 will be as feeble and poorly co-ordinated as it was in some riot boroughs of London in 2011. But we don't want to go down that road, do we? We want more constructive remedies than the iron fist <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/9451748/The-riots-were-a-wake-up-call.html\" title=\"\">Eric Pickles seems keen to wave</a>. To flip an old joke, \"a law-and-order Tory is a libertarian whose neighbourhood's been trashed\".</p> <p>Both oh-so-familiar camps in this debate have solid points to make. As with the Olympic legacy the riots legacy team made promises of outreach and investment, better facilities and job prospects, which have only been patchily met, sometimes not at all. These are hard times for the economy and public investment, though the Met's attempts to recruit more non-white officers ought to have been more successful than they look, hard times or not.</p> <p>Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, co-authors of that excellent book The Spirit Level, made <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/05/riots-inequality-poverty-self-esteem\" title=\"\">another assault</a> on what they call \"the poison of inequality\" in the Guardian last week. Lynsey Hanley, whose experience of life at the sharp end is more hands-on, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/09/have-a-go-heroes-no-substitute\" title=\"\">makes another</a> in today's edition. Even in Stratford, east London, the Games must look a million miles away to some residents.</p> <p>But the \"no excuses\" camp \u2013 which includes a lot of unprivileged immigrant families of all backgrounds \u2013 have their case to make too. In its <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9451759/One-year-on-the-scars-of-the-riots-still-run-deep.html\" title=\"\">critique of the Guardian/LSE study</a>, Reading the Riots, the Sunday Telegraph stated that stop and search rates and unemployment were worse in boroughs like Tower Hamlets and Brent, which did not riot last summer, and that shops, not police buildings, were the main target. The Footlocker looting jibe, a thieving spree by people who didn't expect to be caught, remains a potent one.</p> <p>And do this summer's Olympic champions, drawn from heroically poor backgrounds like boxer Nicola Adams \u2013 her face across the Guardian's front page today \u2013 or the community effort in Flint which supported Jade Jones to her gold goal, as well as more upper crust winners, reinforce the message that poverty and disadvantage is no excuse for urban mayhem?</p> <p>The usual suspects are squabbling over that one too. The answer is even more complicated and nuanced than a 100m final. Success in sport takes teamwork and money as well as individual commitment. But we can hardly blame those who look at Adams's grin and answer the question with an uncomplicated yes.</p> <p>\"Inspiration\" is a sentiment more easily mouthed than achieved. When the Games are over who will have been inspired to do what?</p>",
  "<h2>Sight lines</h2> <p>Which are the best and worst festival venues for seeing theatre? A comment under today's review of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/09/after-the-rainfall-review?newsfeed=true\">After the Rainfall</a> from someone who sat at the back of the venue in Pleasance Dome and was rewarded by seeing almost nothing is a reminder that, beyond the Traverse, very little work on the fringe is seen in ideal conditions. It's often one of the reasons why new writing in particular fares badly on the fringe, although the two plays I've seen so far in the <a href=\"http://https://www.underbelly.co.uk/new-voices-edinburgh-2012 \">Old Vic New Voices season</a> at Underbelly \u2013 B*tch Boxer and One Hour Only (both in Big Belly) \u2013 suggest that when the writing is strong and the design simple you can pull it off.</p> <p>I'd like to hear your tips for Edinburgh's best and worst venues. I've been telling people who are going to see <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/08/mies-julie-edinburgh-review?newsfeed=true\">Mies Julie</a> at <a href=\"http://www.assemblyfestival.com\">Assembly Hall</a> on the Mound that it is well worth getting to the venue early and queuing to get a seat near the front, and quite frankly I'd prefer never to see another theatre show in the <a href=\"http://www.arfringe.com\">Assembly Rooms</a> Ballroom, although the dynamic is fine for comedy. The demonstration room at <a href=\"http://www.summerhall.co.uk\">Summerhall</a> (where I saw the powerful and heartfelt We Are Chechens! and The Shit) is hugely atmospheric, but the acoustics are poor, and in Pleasance Two sound from the courtyard frequently drifts across the stage, a problem that affects many venues. It's been a good decision by <a href=\"http://www.northernstage.co.uk\">Northern Stage at St Stephens</a> to steer clear of the main church space, which even in its Aurora Nova glory days presented enormous difficulties for artists and audiences.</p> <p>The difficulties of venues have always made me wonder why more artists don't take their shows outside and use the natural beauty of Edinburgh as backdrop. Of course that's exactly what the Edinburgh international festival is doing with <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk\">NVA's Speed of Light</a>, which nightly takes 850 people up <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur%27s_Seat,_Edinburgh\">Arthur's Seat</a> in the dark. I'd like to have seen the health and safety report on that. </p> <h2>Bad behavior</h2> <p>Talking of Speed of Light brings us on to bad behavior in the theatre, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/may/08/the-new-cultural-rules-audience\">a subject we have often covered</a>. At least standing up and shouting \"rubbish\", as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/09/orla-o-loughlin-edinburgh-festival?newsfeed=true \">happened at a performance of Morning</a> at the Traverse earlier this week, shows some kind of engagement. It was less obvious on Thursday night on Arthur's Seat, where NVA's participatory artwork was taking place, as it will for the rest of the month. In the briefing before we set off, people were asked not to talk too much and keep their voices low, not to take photographs and to turn off their mobile phones. What happened? People talked incessantly all the way up and down the mountain, took photos and called their friends on their mobiles: \"Hey, you'll never guess, it's 11pm and I'm on Arthur's Seat.\" Whoopee! </p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>Accusing, weary man to girlfriend in the Underbelly bar: \"OK, I'll come and see another show, but not if we have to queue again to buy the tickets and to get into the show. You said doing the fringe would be fun, but I'm beginning feel like a pre-glasnost East German during a food shortage.\"</p> <h2>What to see: my weekly theatre tips</h2> <p>Right, it's an abbreviated What to see this week because the focus is very much on Edinburgh, where the <a href=\"http:// www.eif.co.uk \">international festival</a> opens tomorrow. Shows this week include Grzegorz Jarzyna's 2008: Macbeth which is set in a Middle East state, and Christoph Marthaler's My Fair Lady-inspired Meine faire Dame, about linguistic confusion. On the fringe, my recommendations so far are: Mies Julie at Assembly Mound; Knee Deep at Assembly George Square; Caesarian Section \u2013 Essays on Suicide and The Shit at Summerhall; Bullet Catch, Blink, Morning and Bravo Figaro! at the Traverse; The Curious Scrapbook of Josephine Bean and The Ballad of Pondlife McGurk at the Scottish Book Trust; I Heart Peterborough at Pleasance Courtyard; The Price of Everything, The Ugly Sisters and Oh, the Humanity (I saw this prior to the festival) at Northern Stage at St Stephens; One Hour Only and B*tch Boxer at Underbelly.

  "<p>Or, as I could title this: Lady Boffin 'Blinds' Champ with Coke!</p> <p>In 1917 the <em>American Journal of Physiology</em> published an article with the very descriptive title:<a href=\"http://ajplegacy.physiology.org/content/43/3/371.citation\"> \"A comparison of the effects of breakfast, of no breakfast and of caffeine on work in an athlete and a non-athlete\"</a>. That's a simplified outline of a deceptively complicated set of experiments looking closely at changes in pulse and blood pressure as well as work rate. The results are what we'd probably expect: breakfast is generally good for exercising, while caffeine might be useful but can have some bad side effects in high doses.</p> <p>This might not seem a promising source for a historian, but the article has three intriguing features. The first is the fact that the source of caffeine is Coca-Cola. Bought as syrup it's analysed by the researchers and made up into a \"standard dose\" of 7oz of cola, with 1.42 grains [about 92mg] of caffeine (no mention of any <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/cocaine.asp\">trace cocaine</a>). Why use Coca-Cola? Probably because it's easier to standardise doses with this syrup than with coffee or tea, and is more palatable and familiar than any concoction the researchers could make up themselves. At the time Coca-Cola was still being sold as a \"tonic\" drink, something between a medicine and a food (just like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/jun/19/sports-doping-victorian-style\">Oxo, also used by athletes</a> in the early 20th century).</p> <p>The article also provides a glimpse of Kansas sport culture because of the dramatic effect the caffeine allegedly had on Subject \"B\", the unnamed athlete:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On June 3, 1913, during the time he [B] had been experimenting with the larger doses of caffeine and after he had taken one of the strongest doses, the external rectus muscle of his left eye became paralysed \u2026 \"B's\" friends, among them two physicians, charge it to the influence of the caffeine that \"B\" failed in an athletic exhibition \u2026 during the time that he was conducting the caffeine experiments. Before he began the experiments he had trained himself so that he was able to hit the punching bag with his head, feet and hands alternately on its rebound. It required speed, accuracy and control of muscles, and concentration of thought. He had become an expert in this feat. But his power of concentration, accuracy and precision in his muscles had been greatly impaired so that he was unable to repeat the athletic demonstration with any credit during the time he was taking the strong doses of caffeine.</p> </blockquote> <p>\"A\", the non-athlete, also reported being irritable and disturbed on high caffeine doses, and the researchers halted the experiment. (The maximum dose was about 230mg, equivalent to two or three cups of coffee).</p> <p>Finally, there are the researchers themselves; the lead author is listed simply as \"I.H. Hyde\". This is in fact the pioneering physiologist <a href=\"http://www.etwrc.ku.edu/programs/hall-of-fame/hyde_ida.shtml\">Ida Henrietta Hyde</a> \u2013 a woman who had fought a long battle for a scientific education, the first American woman to get a PhD from Heidelberg university (even though she was forbidden from attending either lectures or laboratory demonstrations!) and the first female member of the American Physiological Association. She wrote about her struggle for an education in an autobiographical account with the extraordinary title: <em><a href=\"www.kuub.ku.edu/awardsscholarships/documents/Before_Women_were_Human_Beings.pdf\">Before Women Were Human Beings</a></em> </p> <p>The experiment described in this paper is an unusual one for Hyde who is best known for <a href=\"http://suite101.com/article/ida-henrietta-hyde-invented-the-microelectrode-a157077\">developing the microelectrode</a>. Experimental physiology was created as a discipline in Europe in the 19th century, predominantly in Germany and France where the focus was on laboratory experiments using animals and isolated biological samples, not whole human beings. Hyde's microelectrode is clearly in the tradition of the great 19th century German physiologists like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_du_Bois-Reymond\">Emil du Bois Reymond</a> and <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hermann-helmholtz/\">Hermann von Helmholtz</a>, who also developed sensitive recording instruments and were particularly interested in the electrical phenomena of the animal body.</p> <p>Studies of whole human beings were rarer, and when physiologists weren't studying their own bodies \u2013 or using their family, friends and students \u2013 they tended to rely on soldiers or on <a href=\"http://www.sportsci.org/news/history/smith/smith.html\">prisoners</a> and not athletes (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/jun/19/sports-doping-victorian-style\">with some exceptions</a>). North American universities had stronger links to athletes; as they began to compete with European institutions by building laboratories and medical schools in the decades around 1900 they also invested heavily in sporting facilities. Although it took a while for <a href=\"http://mjperry.blogspot.co.uk/2007/12/jaw-dropping-compensation-college.html\">university coaches to be paid more than full professors</a>, it may have raised the profile of new physiological laboratories if they could show connections between their own work and the sporting prestige of a college.</p> <p>Despite the contemporary interest in science and sport, Hyde and the misadventure of Subject \"B\" didn't attract the sort of media attention we'd expect today. Every week we seem to find more complaints about the dumbing down or sexing-up of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/oct/21/bad-science-publishing-claims\">scientific press releases</a> \u2013 for which both <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/mar/06/science-journalists-questions-exaggeration\">journalists</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/mar/07/scientists-help-improve-science-journalism\">scientists</a> are to blame. Hyde's research is a perfect storm: pioneering woman in a male-dominated field, Olympic sponsor, drugs and disablement. The headlines would write themselves.</p>",

This should enable you to form a likely price point for your own item and to check whether your cost is therefore going to be realistic. UK retailers are not allowed to discuss margins or retail price points with suppliers for legal reasons. Our focus is on understanding a realistic cost price, so comparisons will help you. You won't be laughed out of the room as long as you are realistic.</p> <p><strong>Know your product:</strong> Many retailers are already aware of the importance of innovation, although some may be more risk averse than others. If you are able to express a compelling reason why the retailer in question would be successful with your product and what it could deliver to the market, I suspect the reception you'll receive will be positive. It is often easy to design things that have a personal benefit. But having a clear understanding the benefit or solution to the wider customer base of a retailer \u2013 and the difference it can make commercially and practically \u2013 will show that you really understand your product and the unique selling points that it offers.</p> <p><em>Paul Boross is a communications expert who runs the online service </em><a href=\"http://www.thepitchdoctor.tv/\" title=\"\"><em>the Pitch Doctor</em></a></p> <p><strong>Keep it personal:</strong> The best way to make contact is always on a personal level. If you can find a way to personally contact the key people in the company, it will increase your chances of getting the sale. Think about who you know who might have access to someone in the company. Even if your first route in is with an email or a phone call, it is much more likely to succeed if you can say that you were referred by someone they know.</p> <p>Written pitches are always tricky as the person receiving the pitch has very little information with which to gauge the kind person you are, and your ultimate credibility. If you have no chance of getting in front of the person or speaking to them on the phone, then I would recommend that you make the pitch as short as possible. Assume that the retailer has probably heard it all before.</p> <p><strong>Don't be pessimistic:</strong> I have met many SMEs who trip themselves up by having a negative belief system and thinking that the buyer won't want to be bothered by their \"little product\". Remember that all buyers really want great product. Whether you are a small or large business is irrelevant when it comes to your credibility. All companies look for the same things in a supplier.</p> <p><em>Helen McAvoy is the co-founder of</em><a href=\"http://www.rocktails.co.uk/ROCKTAILSHome\" title=\"\"><em> Rocktails</em></a></p> <p><strong>Get the numbers right:</strong> Retailers may look for turnover per facing, meaning that each product on the shelf should turnover a certain amount in a week, depending on the retailer and the aisle you're in. Also, units per branch per week (this tends to be a favourite of the supermarkets); and profit per unit, so if they make \u00a31 gross profit per sale on your product, but they only make 25p profit on another product on the shelf then they effectively have to sell four times as much of the other product. Great for you, if that is the case.</p> <p>Getting figures for all these things is by no means easy, and you may need to make friends in the industry to get the insider info. However, have a few figures for these things will probably please the buyer more than five slides of \"fluffy stuff\".</p> <p><em>Karen Cook is the head of sustainable development and community enterprise at </em><a href=\"http://www.rocktails.co.uk/ROCKTAILSHome\" title=\"\"><em>Lloyds Banking Group Commercial</em></a></p> <p><strong>Adopt sustainable business practices:</strong> Quite often in pitching for and securing contracts to supply large retailers (and other large companies and local authorities) businesses are asked to state their sustainability credentials. There are various accreditations that businesses can seek to demonstrate these, but smaller businesses do not always seek to take accreditation and often feel that they are then \"out of the race\". This really isn't the case.

  "<p>The train grinds to a halt just outside a station and you're left sitting there, knowing you're going to be late for work. You're going to miss a meeting, you've finished reading the paper and you need a coffee \u2013 but in addition to these frustrations could you also face having your wages docked?</p> <p>How about if you work as a waiter and a customer leaves an unpaid bill \u2013 can your boss force you to settle it out of your pay? This scenario was addressed in a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/aug/03/waiter-pay-bill-customer-didnt\" title=\"Waiter had to pay bill when customer didn't\">recent letter to Guardian Money</a>, and prompted some similar tales from readers, so we thought it was worth exploring when employers are allowed to withhold some of your earnings.</p> <p>The bad news is that wages can be deducted for those who arrive late due to disruptions to public transport or for some other unforeseen reason (unless your contract says otherwise).</p> <p>The good news is that no extra penalties or deductions should be made unless there is specific provision for such deductions in your contract. Without such specific provisions, any additional docking of pay for you being late would amount to an \"unlawful deduction from wages\" for which you have statutory protection under the Employment Rights Act 1996.</p> <p>An unlawful deduction in breach of statute would entitle a worker to bring an employment tribunal claim in respect of unpaid sums. And unlike claims for unfair dismissal, which can only be made by employees, the law relating to unlawful deductions extends its protection to a wider category of workers, which can include the self-employed where their relationship mirrors that of an employee in everything but name.</p> <p>The general position regarding other deductions from your salary is the same: employers will have difficulty justifying deductions where the right is not reserved in your contract. There are some circumstances, though, where an employer can validly make deductions from wages. These include:</p> <p>\u2022 Any deduction which is authorised by statute (such as tax and national insurance)</p> <p>\u2022 Where you have been overpaid previously and your employer is deducting the excess</p> <p>\u2022 A deduction as a result of your taking part in strike or other industrial action</p> <p>There have been some colourful examples of employers who have sought to make deductions. There was a recent situation where a town hall <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9310836/Council-docked-Muslim-workers-pay-for-prayer-breaks.html\" title=\"Council docked Muslim worker's pay for prayer breaks\">docked five minutes of pay from a Muslim worker because he stopped work to pray</a> once a day during office hours. The union acting for the worker argued that there was an \"obvious discrepancy\" between the way the Muslim worker was treated and those who smoke or go to the lavatory more than others.</p> <p>When looking at what counts as \"wages\" from which deductions may be made, this isn't just your basic salary \u2013 it also includes commission and bonuses, and benefits such as holiday pay and sick pay. Even suspended employees are entitled to be paid their normal salary (unless the contract states otherwise). Recent case law has also determined that denying workers a promised pay rise can amount to an unlawful deduction.</p> <p>If you do have a claim for unlawful deductions, you should first try and resolve the matter informally with your employer, and if necessary lodge a formal grievance. You can otherwise bring a claim in an employment tribunal provided it is made within three months less one day from the date the deduction was made. You can also bring a breach of contract claim in the courts, for which there is a much longer time limit.</p> <p>If an unlawful deduction has been made, you are entitled to payment (or repayment) of the sum unlawfully deducted, and in some cases compensation for further financial loss. In extreme cases, you may have reason to resign and claim constructive dismissal, although you should preferably lodge a grievance before you do so, and make sure you take advice.</p> <p>Many workers feel undervalued when their employers seek to dock their wages on trivial grounds, even if the right is reserved in their contract of employment. Knowing about your employment rights will clearly be beneficial, but of prime importance will doubtless be the hope your employer will not act oppressively in the first place.</p> <p>Have you ever been on the receiving end of a deduction of pay, and if so did you consider it justified?</p> <p><em>Philip Landau is an employment lawyer at </em><a href=\"http://www.lzwlaw.co.uk/documents/employment_law.htm\" title=\"\"><em>Landau Zeffertt Weir solicitors</em></a></p>",
  "<p>\"Oh no, your finger is bleeding,\" says Toni Arthur-Hay. \"Can I get you a plaster?\" There's something incredibly reassuring about this: like meeting one of your old primary school teachers many years on and finding that the first thing they want to do is sit you down on a pleather pouffe and read you The Fantastic Mr Fox. During the 60s, 70s and early 80s, Arthur-Hay - who as I leave her house will also check if I \"need to use the toilet\" - was a kind of primary school teacher to the nation as the presenter of both Play School and its sister show, Play Away: a self-described \"bit of rough\" for both shows who, while well-spoken, always hinted at something a little more untamed than the average RP-speaking BBC personality of the time.</p> <p>Just what kind of bit of rough is still a fairly well-kept secret. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9lc5tPiom0&amp;feature=related\">Watch her in her old incarnation as Toni Arthur</a> (the Hay was added to her name after her second marriage, to the writer Malcolm Hay, in 1996) interviewing Morrissey about his loathing of music videos on the TV-am sofa in 1984, alongside Henry Kelly and Paul Gambaccini, and there's an impulse to write her off as the grey-bloused establishment, but look closely: her hairstyle is a feathercut worthy of Joan Jett's lost home counties cousin, and a defensive Morrissey is thrown into inarticulateness by the fact that she seems to know exactly where he's coming from. </p> <p>Arthur's own albums, recorded in the late 60s and early 70s with her first husband Dave, are more stubbornly uncommercial than any Smiths LP: several rare-as-hen's-teeth, raw examples of the British musical storytelling tradition, of which the last, 1970's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4SkDs5xOI4\">Hearken To The Witches Rune</a>, is a haunting proto acid folk classic.</p> <p>I'd heard Arthur-Hay - now a phenomenally well-preserved 71, with a terrific, thick grey mane ending just above her eyes in a witchy rock fringe - was living in Norfolk from my folk musician friend Michael, who'd tracked her down and persuaded her to come out of retirement and sing at an event at <a href=\"http://www.efdss.org/\">Cecil Sharp House</a> early last decade. She'd agreed to speak to me for some research I was doing for my new book, and was immediately extremely welcoming and voluble, telling me about her and Dave's visit to a coven in Notting Hill Gate during their research for Hearken To The Witches Rune, where they were required to dance naked (\"I was terrified that Play School would find out!\"), and showing me her witch's pendants. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394521623\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Our_experts/columnists/2012/8/10/1344598565816/Bruce-Lacey-and-his-clock-008.jpg\" alt=\"Bruce Lacey and his clock face robot\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bruce Lacey and his clock face robot.

I might have been more thrown myself, had I not visited the performance artist and robot maker <a href=\"http://www.camdenartscentre.org/whats-on/view/exh22.01\">Bruce Lacey</a> a couple of weeks previously at his cluttered farmhouse 20 miles north of here, and sat down between a ventriloquist's dummy and a humanoid made out of a clock and listened to Lacey tell me about the time he did a naked fertility ritual in front of his ex-wife while her new lover drummed for him. </p> <p>Though Devon, Cornwall and Suffolk run it close, there is probably not another county in Britain with more ageing creative eccentrics per square yard than Norfolk. If you were someone like Lacey or Arthur-Hay with an interest in all things occult and folkish, who'd had a fairly wild and unusual existence in the 60s and 70s, and who wanted somewhere rural to settle down, Berkshire and Surrey were never going to quite do the trick. </p> <p>It's Norfolk's own witchy past that probably plays a big part in this: it's something that, once you've been here long enough, you can feel in the air over a misty fen or at dusk on a quiet, hedged byway, under the light of a nearby church. I recently visited the wonderful <a href=\"http://www.museumofwitchcraft.com/\">Museum Of Witchcraft</a> in Boscastle, Cornwall, which features a wall chart recording the hangings, burnings and drownings of women accused of witchcraft in the 16 and 1700s, and their location. What it shows is that Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex are to witch deaths what the USA, China and GB are to 2012 Olympic medals.</p> <p>Not only does the Boscastle museum feature an amazingly spooky collection of witch's puppets, mummified cats and tarot machines, it does a great job of debunking the myth that witchcraft is synonymous with black magic. Arthur-Hay is similarly keen to emphasise this: her and Dave's interest in witchcraft (which she points out she has never practised) came about because she saw it as a \"kind religion\" that \"could often help mentally disturbed people understand their problems\". </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394521624\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Our_experts/columnists/2012/8/10/1344598450376/Hearken-To-The-Witches-Ru-001.jpg\" alt=\"Hearken To The Witches Rune\" width=\"220\" height=\"220\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hearken To The Witches Rune. Photograph: Tom Cox</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Cox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nonetheless, there is something unusually stripped down and spooky about Hearken To The Witches Rune: it's a soundtrack to an unmade Hammer horror cult classic even more chilling than The Witchfinder General, Michael Reeves' 1968 film about witch hunter Matthew Hopkins' hysterical misogynist reign of terror through the eastern part of East Anglia. Of course, the album's black cover and rare nature add to its ambience. I know long-haired men in capes who've travelled over 100 miles just on a vague rumour about a record shop containing a copy. Arthur-Hay tells me the comedian Stewart Lee paid towards $100 for his.</p> <p>Witches Rune was recorded on the outskirts of London, where Dave and Toni lived at the time, but it's entirely suited to a Norfolk setting. \"If there was a folk club in Norfolk, we played there,\" says Toni. \"We spent a lot of time collecting stories before we recorded it, and of course a lot of them came from here. Matthew Hopkins shut this place up. There was such a great tradition of balladry and folklore, but after what he did people were afraid. It's part of the reason why it's still very hard to get stuff out of people in Norfolk.\" </p> <p>It's a perspective that I perhaps should keep in mind when I have a tough time getting a quote out of a taciturn Norfolk tradesman: maybe he's not being difficult after all, it's just that his great great great great great great great grandmother was accused of being a witch. Norfolk is a place that gives up its secrets slowly. </p> <p>In my case, it also took a long time to give up an original copy of Hearken To The Witches Rune. I finally found mine at a record fair in Norwich earlier this year, after many years of searching. It was priced at \u00a340, but I got chatting to the guy selling it, and he was very open about where he'd found it and let it go for \u00a330.

  "<p>So it's over. We ended the tournament against Iceland with our best performance of the Games, but coudn't get that elusive win. After the game there were a few sad faces around because it was the end of the journey, a long journey for some people, and a lot of emotional sacrifices were made to get to this point.</p> <p>But I have to say that it was great in the dressing room afterwards. It was a really good atmosphere, people were happy with the perfomances and the fight that we had shown \u2013 we could have quite easily turned up and not fought for it but that's not in our nature. A few of the lads really put themselves in the shop window I think.</p> <p>Has it been worth the effort? The time away from home, the sacrifices we've all had to make over the past five years? Undoubtedly. Every time I walked out into the Copper Box I was blown away by the reaction of the crowd. Against France, the first game, it was incredible as you'd expect, but the impact never lessened. It was the same level, the same amount of passion and for me the same amount of pride in my chest as I was walking out. You hear people talking about the Olympics as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Now I know what they're talking about. It's been absolutely fantastic and I'm so glad that I've had the opportunity to do it.</p> <p>I've no idea how I'll feel after the closing ceremony on Sunday. A lot of the boys shed a tear or two during the opening ceremony and after the Iceland match and that's great, but it's not really how I respond to things. I'm just happy to be here and taking it all in. I'll be sad, because it'll be properly over but also I'll be happy because it's been a long five years. Part of me will be relieved to focus on other things. It's been such a huge target and now we've done it it's nice to have it out of the way. Some things are so big they block the view of everything else.</p> <p>That said it feels a bit strange not having the Olympics ahead of me. It's difficult to think that this is it, that it's been and gone. It's been an amazing experience. But it's just the beginning for British handball. The reaction to it has been amazing. I believe it's firmly on the map now in the UK and we need to capitalise on it.</p> <p>I'm fairly confident that 90% of the British public with tickets in the Copper Box had never seen handball before. They've gone there with a completely clean slate, no preconceived ideas and they've hopefully been blown away like everyone else. It's a difficult sport not to like, with the entertainment value you get. I'm pretty sure there'll be a lot of public interest.</p> <p>For me personally, I'm waiting to see if I get any offers over the next few weeks. I'm not sure that they'll be coming but I've been offered a job managing the British handball centre of excellence in Bedford. It's a chance to stay involved and use my experience to help the young guys coming through the ranks, so I'm talking to the British Handball Association about that. If a decent offer comes in for me to continue my playing career then I'll consider it \u2013 I've still got a few years left in my legs \u2013 but I'm pretty sure my immediate future will be in the UK, supporting the legacy.</p> <p>As for Team GB, we've got European championship qualifiers against Greece and Italy coming up in October, so we've got that to look forward to. We were close to those two teams back in May, so if we can keep the core of the squad together we'll be in with a good shout against those boys. Then the next funding cycle is announced in the new year, so we'll see what happens with that. Our head coach Dragan Djukic is leaving, so that leaves us probably Bill Baillie, the assistant, as interim coach for now because they haven't got the money to offer anyone a contract. It's going to have to be carefully managed but I'm sure we'll be continuing and making progress.</p> <p>Our performances could have been better, but if you look at the progress that we have made, it's been outstanding. And with the public interest it's going to be difficult for those who control the funding to turn round and say: \"You know what, we're not going to fund the legacy sports.\" Because everyone will be asking why. The motto of the Games has been \"Inspire a generation\" and hopefully that's what we've done.</p>",
  "<p>In Washington, conventional wisdom is everything. It's the driver of perceptions, and often of self-fulfilling political prophecies. That's why you might notice a guarded confidence amongst the Obama campaign these past few weeks: generally speaking, most realistic experts predict a victory for the president in this November's election.</p> <p>This perception is reinforced by current polling, some of the most recent being published by Quinnipiac University, the New York Times and CBS News, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8334-250_162-57483964/quinnipiac-university-cbs-news-new-york-times-poll-8-1-12/\">giving President Obama an edge</a> over Romney in key states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. Certainly, it will be a tight race, but by any realistic standard, the money is on Obama to pull out a victory, even narrowly.</p> <p>But it's exactly the likely closeness of the race that may turn Washington's conventional wisdom on its head on election day. That's because, until relatively recently, political experts and journalists have been oblivious to a widespread and pernicious phenomenon occurring in many critical swing states \u2013 one that, unless checked, could erase Obama's electoral edge.</p> <p>This phenomenon takes the form of a <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/07/how-voter-id-laws-could-affect-the-outcome-in-november-130443.html\">spate of new voter laws</a>: efforts by Republican governors and Republican-controlled state legislatures to pass restrictive new voting rules just in time for election day. As a result, at least 5 million Americans <a href=\"http://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/study_new_voting_restrictions_may_affect_more_than_five_million\">could essentially lose their right to vote</a>, according to the non-partisan Brennan Center in New York. </p> <p>It's no surprise that these laws are almost uniformly designed to disenfranchise young people and minorities \u2013 the very demographics that make up part of Obama's base. And 5 million votes flagrantly stolen from the Democrats, especially in the swing states where Obama currently has the edge, could easily spell a Romney victory.</p> <p>The Republican strategy here is simply too blatant to be believed, hence the relatively muted press coverage on the issue. Indeed, while Republican lawmakers have been busy undermining the basic rights of Americans for months now, it was not until recent weeks that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/20/us/politics/tougher-voter-id-laws-set-off-court-battles.html?pagewanted=all\">the New York Times</a> and Washington Post started paying attention.</p> <p>As well they should, because it's no exaggeration to say that the results of these partisan tactics could make the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/36-Days-Complete-Chronicle-Presidential/dp/B000HWYV4W/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344539931&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=36+days\">Floridian recount of 2000</a> look like a minor political spat. We're looking at an election doomsday scenario that could eclipse any political scandal in American history.</p> <p>Hyperbole? Not when you examine the new laws more closely. The legislation being passed by Republicans across the country takes various forms, all designed to stop likely Obama voters casting ballots.</p> <p>The most common tactic is to heavily restrict the types of identification required at polling stations. In Pennsylvania, for example, that means requiring all voters to present <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20120809_Philly_city_commissioners_chief_denounces_voter_ID_law_with_data.html\">very limited types of ID</a> only available from the state's department of transportation. Since many inner-city voters don't drive, or many young voters have out-of-state driver's licenses, these likely Obama voters will all be stopped dead in their tracks before they reach the polling booth. The problem is so severe that the state of Pennsylvania itself has admitted that nearly 10% of voters do not have the required identification. In Philadelphia, an Obama stronghold, that figure is closer to 20%. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/10/eric-holder-voter-id-poll-tax_n_1662847.html\">Attorney General Eric Holder summed it up</a> perfectly when he called these voter ID measures the equivalent of a \"poll tax\", at the NAACP summit in July.</p> <p>In Florida, where history proves that less than 1,000 votes can swing a national election, the efforts to stop minorities and the poor from voting are not just limited to new voter identification laws. In fact, voter registration drives have been banned, and early voting, thought to favor Democrats, has been significantly curtailed. Even more worrying is Governor Rick Scott's attempt simply to remove Obama voters from the election rolls. In May, Scott ordered a purge of his state's voter lists, based on drivers' license records, which he acknowledged to be deeply flawed.</p> <p>As a result, the state's division of elections initially found a mind-boggling 180,000 \"ineligible voters\" by performing a search of a computer database with inaccurate information. Yet, the purge goes on: the Miami Herald found that 58% of the people in a sample of 2,700 \"ineligible\" voters were Hispanic, and 14% were black. Whites and Republicans were least likely to be barred from voting. Even a second world war veteran was told he was not a citizen and <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/06/01/1096521/-Florida-tells-another-91-year-old-WWII-veteran-he-s-not-a-nbsp-citizen\">so to stay away from the voting booth</a>.</p> <p>Of course, Republicans justify their efforts to suppress the vote by arguing that they're simply preventing illegal voting. That sounds entirely fair \u2013 until you consider that the proven occurrence of voter fraud is almost non-existent. In fact, not a single person has ever been prosecuted for voting illegally. Yet, the public seems ambivalent about voter ID laws, which is why similar dirty tricks continue, taking various forms in other competitive states such as Virginia, New Hampshire, Ohio, Wisconsin and North Carolina.</p> <p>Luckily, progressive groups and the federal government are pushing back. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/25/us-usa-voterid-pennsylvania-idUSBRE86O1L120120725\">In Pennsylvania</a>, groups like the <a href=\"http://www.advancementproject.org/\">Advancement Project</a> and the ACLU have filed suit on behalf of 38 plaintiffs, challenging the constitutionality of the new laws in state courts. The Advancement Project is also intervening in Wisconsin, fighting the fact that 78% of young African-American men lack the appropriate ID to vote, for example. The <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/justice-department-probes-pennsylvania-voter-id-law-225602771.html\">US department of justice is also intervening</a> in Pennsylvania and other states, questioning whether new laws disproportionately discriminate against minorities. And the Obama campaign is acutely aware of the danger, with dozens of staffers in the campaign headquarters and out in the field monitoring daily developments in every critical state.</p> <p>These counter-efforts are critical, yet the fear among Democrats is that they may not be sufficient to stop the new laws taking effect before the election. That is a significant danger, not only to the legitimacy of the results of the presidential race, but for the very core of America's democratic process. And, of course, it highlights the need for uniform standards across the country that guarantee free and fair elections.</p> <p>That's a battle for a later date. For now, we can only hope that voters will get wise to the Republican tactics and make every effort to <a href=\"http://www.866ourvote.org/\">make their voices heard on 6 November</a>.</p>",

  "<p>Recent calculations of the economic value of nature and ecosystem services have caused many environmentalists to react negatively. They point to the risk of a progressive \"privatisation\" and \"commodification\" of nature, and argue that society should appreciate the intrinsic values of nature \u2013 nature for its own sake. Putting a 'price on nature' will create more enclosures whereby the public benefits derived from ecosystems will be seized by corporations and other private interests.</p> <p>The new discourse about \"natural capital\" is seen by some as another step towards the degradation of the biosphere. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/06/price-rivers-rain-greatest-privatisation\" title=\"\">George Monbiot wrote is such terms this week</a>. He argued:</p> <blockquote> Rarely will the money to be made by protecting nature match the money to be made by destroying it. Nature offers low rates of return by comparison to other investments. If we allow the discussion to shift from values to value \u2013 from love to greed \u2013 we cede the natural world to the forces wrecking it. <br> </blockquote> <p>But to paint such a one-sided picture is a dangerous game. For decades campaigners have fought for the protection of nature for its own sake, and while there has been notable progress (seen for example in the rapid increase in protected areas worldwide, which will hopefully continue irrespective of purely economic evaluations), the overall trends have not been encouraging.</p> <p>The destruction of unprotected forests, loss of soils, depletion of aquifers, extinction of animals and plants and plunder of the oceans has continued apace. It seems that the moral argument has gained insufficient traction, and that in the absence of new frames continuing population and economic growth will cause more damage.</p> <p>One source of hope comes from the growing realisation that nature is essential for economic development. The message is clear: without nature the economy is nothing. That penny is beginning to drop in various important places, and could soon lead to a new era of policy-making. One in which ecology and economics go hand in hand, but only if we have the tools to build bridges between these worlds that are so alien to each other. And that is where the economic valuation of nature can come in.</p> <p>By appreciating that nature is vital for economics, and has measurable tangible financial values, it is possible to get the attention of people who have at best hitherto regarded nature a supplier of resources, or worse still an economically costly distraction that gets in the way of economic 'growth'. Making the moral case in the face of such beliefs won't work. If, on the other hand, such scepticism can be met with economically compelling logic, then we might get a bit further.</p> <p>There are of course ecological values (like beauty and the very fact that things exist) that sometimes cannot be assigned financial values, and should be protected by the law, policy and public backing rather than through markets.</p> <p>There are certainly dangers that come with financial values being attached to natural systems. These might be seen in how countries choose to reflect the value of ecosystems (like forests) that indigenous people rely on and have ancestral rights over (or should do). Those dangers need to be managed with regulations and other safeguards when, for example, those same forests are deemed as financially valuable in supplying a distant city with water, and when managing that water affect the rights of the people in the forest. There are risks but just outcomes can be secured.</p> <p>While I am alarmed at how some environmentalists reject the economic valuation of nature, I am more alarmed still at how such a position can appear similar to those with deeply sceptical views about whether we should protect the environment in the first place. Nigel Lawson, the arch climate change denier, is like many environmentalists dead against putting financial values on nature. He knows well that if this happens then economics would have to change in fundamental ways requiring new government policies, changes to how capital is invested and shifts in consumption patterns. By campaigning against the valuation of ecosystem services, some campaigners could inadvertently strengthen the hand of those who believe nature has little or no value, moral, economic or otherwise.</p> <p>And it seems to me there is not a choice here. I have spent the past 25 years campaigning for nature for its own sake, because it is beautiful, because it should exist for its own reasons and because we have no right to destroy it. I have found that not everyone agrees with that though, and while I am trying to convince them, more forests are cleared, oceans polluted and greenhouse gases released.</p> <p>We could carry on like this, with ideological purity preserved (on all sides), or we could open a new discourse, one that requires the sceptics to meaningfully engage, and on the field where future environmental battles will be won and lost \u2013 the field of economics. After all, it is not most environmentalists who have misunderstood the realities that come with 'growth' a finite Earth, but most economists.</p> <p>\u2022 Tony Juniper's book on the value of ecosystems for economies, What has Nature ever done for us? will be published in January</p>",
  "<p>Despite the many initiatives launched in the last two decades, there is still a long way to go to tackle Britain's big health and lifestyle challenges: alcohol misuse, obesity and smoking. The biggest and worst of these public health challenges remains <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/smoking\" title=\"\">smoking</a>. Unlike high-fat foods or alcohol, there is no acceptable level of consumption of cigarettes. Smoking kills \u2013 it's that simple. Not only does smoking shorten smokers' lives, but it also comes at an enormous cost to the taxpayer. Smoking-related illnesses are estimated to cost the NHS at least \u00a32.7bn a year in England alone.</p> <p>Today marks the closure of the government's consultation on whether plain packaging of tobacco products should be introduced in the UK. The prospect of standardised cigarette packaging coming into law will inevitably result in a greater focus on the harmful effects associated with smoking and the role that our government can play in helping people to kick the habit.</p> <p>The medical evidence is startlingly clear; smoking is the single biggest preventable cause of early death and illness in the UK, each year directly accounting for more than 100,000 unnecessary deaths. One in two long-term smokers will die prematurely from a smoking related disease. We also know that smoking harms others through passive smoking in the home, and smoking by pregnant women also remains a significant problem. More than one in six mothers smoke during pregnancy, with potentially harmful results for both mum and baby.</p> <p>Smoking also comes at a large financial cost, and often to those who can least afford it. The average price for a packet of cigarettes translates to \u00a351.80 a week for a 20-a-day habit. We know that smoking rates are highest among those on the lowest incomes, further entrenching the health inequalities that exist between the richest and poorest people in our country.</p> <p>So how do we change things? We must discourage young people from taking up smoking in the first place. While there are fewer older adult smokers than there were a decade ago, smoking is still common among young people, and in particular amongst teenage girls.</p> <p>The triumph of Britain's athletes at the London Olympic Games has provided a once in a generation opportunity to inspire people to do more exercise and to address some of the toughest public health challenges we face as a country, but it is unlikely that sporting inspiration and the Olympic legacy alone will be enough. One of the most overlooked and potentially most successful aspects of the coalition government's recent NHS reforms was the allocation of much of the public health budget and the responsibility for public health and wellbeing to local councils. Given that there is a clear and pressing need to do more to encourage young people not to smoke, and that local councils also have a responsibility for education, there is now a real potential for properly targeted and co-ordinated public health and lifestyle interventions in our schools, building not only on Britain's Olympic success but also looking to the longer-term.</p> <p>But we need to go further than education. Studies show that it is young people who are also more likely to be seduced by the marketing techniques of the tobacco companies, which include the way in which <a href=\"http://www.stir.ac.uk/2012/tobacco-packaging-consultation/name-24012-en.html\" title=\"\">cigarette packets are branded and packaged to increase their appeal</a>. The government needs to review all of the available evidence about the effectiveness of such a measure before going ahead with a plain packaging policy, but introducing plain packaging for cigarettes could certainly help to reduce the brand marketing appeal of cigarettes to teenagers, and most importantly, help to stop young people from developing a smoking habit that can only shorten their lives.</p>",
  "<p>Google's Android mobile operating system tightened its grip on the smartphone market in the second quarter of 2012, making up 68.1% of the 154m shipments worldwide, <a href=\"http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS23638712\">according to the research company IDC</a>.</p> <p>Overall, the smartphone market grew at 42.2%, meaning that Android and Microsoft's Windows Phone were the only platforms which grew faster than the overall market. Shipments of Apple's iPhone grew by 27.5% to 26m, not enough to maintain its share from last year of 18.8%; its share fell to 16.9%.</p> <p>But overall the market remains a two-horse race, with the two principal platforms - Android and iOS - making up 85% of the market, with the remaining 15% shared between four main platforms.</p> <p>And the concentration of control is also emphasised by the fact that two companies, Apple and Samsung, controlled 49.5% of the world smartphone market. </p> <p>Nokia, Taiwan's HTC, China's ZTE and RIM together shipped 34.4m, or 22.3% of the market - leaving a huge number of other vendors fighting for the remaining share. Most of those are sold into China via MediaTek, and run Android. China is now the world's largest smartphone market, with low-cost Android phones dominating even more than in the worldwide market. In the US, the second-biggest market. Apple's iPhone has around 50% share, aided by subsidies from carriers that make it no more expensive than many mid-range Android handsets.</p> <p>ZTE's rise, with 8m handsets shipped, came principally through low-cost devices in China but is also working on sales in the US - though IDC observed that its lack of strong brand recognition could be a problem if it wants to see high sales growth outside China. </p> <p>However the growth in the smartphone market segment - which accounted for 37.9% of the overall mobile market of 406m in the second quarter, according to <a href=\"http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS23624612\">separate IDC analysis</a> - was the slowest since the fourth quarter of 2009, when the world was still recovering from the global crash precipitated by Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy in mid-2008. </p> <p>That has analysts wondering whether economic problems particularly in Europe will seriously crimp worldwide growth both in feature phones and smartphones. Ramon Llamas, senior research analyst with IDC's mobile phone team, said: \"Despite recent maneouvres to shore up several countries within the eurozone, the effectiveness of these efforts remains to be seen. Meanwhile, emerging markets will continue to be strong contributors due to their sheer size and growth trajectory, but how much they can offset potential declines in other countries is unclear.\"</p> <p>RIM saw shipments fall from 12.5m a year ago to 7.4m - a 4.8% share, its lowest in more than five years years, while the eclipse of Nokia's Symbian, which once dominated the smartphone market, was demonstrated as shipments fell to 6.8m - just 4.4% of the market, 15 months after it was earmarked for phasing out by Stephen Elop, Nokia's chief executive.</p> <p>But Windows Phone, Nokia's new platform, remains low, shipping roughly 5.4m handsets - almost all due to Nokia - to more than double the number shipped, but only grew its share from 3.0% to 3.5%.</p> <p>\"Android continues to fire on all cylinders,\" said Llamas. \"The market was entreated to several flagship models from Android's handset partners, prices were well within reach to meet multiple budgetary needs, and the user experience from both Google and its handset partners boosted Android smartphones' utility far beyond simple telephony.\"</p> <p>\"The mobile OS market is now unquestionably a two-horse race due to the dominance of Android and iOS,\" said Kevin Restivo, IDC senior research analyst for mobile phones. \"With much of the world's mobile phone user base still operating feature phones, the smartphone OS market share battle is far from over. There is still room for some mobile OS competitors to gain share, although such efforts will become increasingly difficult as smartphone penetration increases.\"</p>",

  "<p>Do you like beards? I like beards. But I know plenty of women who don't. Most adult men I know don't have beards. Which is weird, when you think about it. Because beards are a biological signal. A signal that says, \"I am a sexually mature male, ready for mating. I have excellent genes and will impregnate you with fine children. Mate with me ladies.\" They are the human equivalent of peacocks' tails.</p> <p>From an evolutionary standpoint, shaving off beards makes no sense, so why do many men do it? I'll tell you why. It's because human beings are highly complex social animals embedded in highly complex social systems. Culture, fashion and what-other-people-do have an enormous influence on us. So much so they can completely confound our biological programming. So when evolutionary psychology looks at mate choice in humans, it needs to bear in mind this inconvenient fact. Which means I take this recent Telegraph headline, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/9461799/Stressed-men-prefer-larger-women.html\" title=\"\">\"Stressed men prefer larger women\"</a>, with something of a pinch of salt.</p> <p>This reports on a <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0042593\" title=\"\">study in PloS ONE</a> in which they gave some white, male, Westminster undergraduates a mock job interview, then showed them pictures of women of a range of body types, and asked them which they found attractive. They found that the \"stressed\" students picked slightly larger women than the control group. And concluded that when we experience acute stress (indicating, perhaps, a threatening environment), we become more attracted to bodies that suggest maturity as it makes us feel safer.</p> <p>I know we shouldn't get exercised about subheadings, which are generally not written by the author (and certainly not by the scientists). But, I give you: \"Tightening one's belt in a recession is usually considered prudent, but women may be advised to do the opposite after a study found that in tough times stressed men turn to larger ladies for comfort.\" Oh no, we thought we were supposed to be thin, but now we might have made ourselves too thin for boys to like us! Let us cry hopelessly into our pillows ladies.</p> <p>Thing is, there's a massive difference between the adrenaline and cortisol burst from a 10-minute mock job interview, and the complex physiological effects of long-term stress such as unemployment, poverty or economic uncertainty. A recession, for those at the sharp end, is really nothing like a few minutes of embarrassment.</p> <p>To be fair, neither the scientists nor the bulk of the article make the recession comparison, they simply talk about stress. But there are other problems. White university undergraduates in London are not representative or typical of all human beings. Not only are they young, educated, well-fed, but they are embedded within one particular complex social system. Jane Austen's heroines develop accomplishments such as embroidery and piano playing to impress potential husbands. I think my boyfriend is a lot more impressed by me always carrying a penknife than my grade one piano certificate. The sensible strategies for life in one complex social system are not necessarily the sensible strategies for life in <em>another</em> complex social system. We can't draw conclusions about all humanity, or about our evolutionary programming, from the behaviour of 80 London undergraduates.</p> <p>There are also other possible explanations for these results. We live in a culture that sends us messages about what we are supposed to look like, and what we are supposed to find attractive. You see thousands of images of young, scantily clad women with unnatural body shapes every day. Of course this influences what people actually do and think. But even more, it influences what they <em>think</em> they think. And what they <em>say</em> they think. It may be that many men naturally prefer slightly larger women than we're presented with as the cultural ideal, and this is overlaid by an idea of what we are \"supposed\" to like. Perhaps stress makes this natural preference leak out more. Part of their brain is too busy worrying to remember what they are supposed to like. This isn't a possibility the scientists seem to have considered. Innate preferences is all, let's ignore the effects of cultural programming.</p> <p>There are thousands of psychology papers published every day. Why is it that a small and limited study, finding a very small effect, gets covered in the science media when so much else doesn't? Is this article, ironically, just another example of the cultural obsession with women's weight, which pop evolutionary psychology so studiously ignores?</p>",
  "<p>People often say to me: \"You used to be a lawyer. Does that make your job as a comedian easier?\" Yes, if my gigs comprised of questioning the audience about their whereabouts on a particular date. I'm not entirely sure my knowledge of the <em>loi Badinter</em> (French traffic law) will ever help me, unless I'm heckled in French by someone commenting on my driving.</p> <p>When I was studying law, I worked on death row for a summer in North Carolina. So does the fact that I used to interview serial killers help me when I'm telling jokes? Not really, although I find I'm comfortable in tense situations; and if someone insists I perform behind a reinforced perspex screen, it's totally cool with me.</p> <p>I also had a gun pointed at me in the US. I was in a roadhouse in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/jan/23/music-appalachian-mountains-kentucky-america\" title=\"\">Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia</a>, interviewing a prison officer. I asked what I thought was a fairly innocuous question and she said: \"I have a loaded gun under the table. And it's pointed at you.\" It was a short interview \u2013 and one that makes heckling seem a lot less frightening.</p> <p>The one thing my past career did give me, though, is experience in negotiating. Almost every gig is a bit of give and take, like drawing up a contract. The audience comes in with their attitude, either up for it or not, and the comedian comes to the table with their terms \u2013 that people should laugh. Sometimes the negotiation is quick and everyone agrees to the terms immediately; sometimes the two sides are so entrenched it's like trying to organise the coalition's Christmas party.</p> <p>The other thing law has helped me with is spotting bullshit. It's the first thing you learn as a lawyer and in comedy it's as common as drunks round a kebab shop. Whenever anyone says \"I loved your show\", I ask: \"Really, which bit did you like best?\" When they look confused, I say: \"Was it the bit where I pretend to be a rhino mating with an aubergine?\" And if they nod, I smile. Because I don't do that. It would be stupid to pretend to be a rhino. I'm too little. I actually pretend to be a badger.</p>",

Similarly, a person who was said to have died from pneumonia, might also have been old, frail, unable to get out of bed and had dementia, Fletcher said. As such, it was more accurate to say they had died from old age, frailty and dementia.</p> <p>In 40% of the cases where there were mistakes (around one in 10 overall), giving a more accurate cause of death meant changing <a href=\"http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/\" title=\"\">the category of disease as covered by the World Health Organisation</a>. This could mean reclassifying the cause of death as respiratory rather than neurological, Fletcher said.</p> <p>Doctors had not always understood when they must refer matters to a coroner, he added.</p> <p>\"There was a failure to appreciate a cause of death that might be unnatural. Take pulmonary fibrosis \u2013 a disease that might be acquired industrially. This is an area of mining and steelworks. The registrar would be required by law to refer this to a coroner.</p> <p>\"Doctors receive little or no training in death certification or coroner referral.\"</p> <p>Fletcher said he was confident the medical examiner system would ensure that relevant cases would always be referred to a coroner, and that medical certificates were as accurate as possible.</p> <p>He said there was no formal checklist for deciding a person's cause of death.</p> <p>\"It is more helpful to read the records as you might read a story. I would look at the name, age, start of the last illness, admission to hospital or the last visits to or from a GP. Was the working diagnosis correct? Were investigations done properly and acted on where necessary? I am looking for red flags; for instance, falls, has a patient's condition changed or a concern from relatives been recorded? I am even more careful if the patient had no relatives, because then they have no advocate.\"</p> <p>He said there could be a spectrum of certainty. \"There is a world of difference between citing a known precise cause of death for someone who has been in hospital for a week or two and undergone lots of tests, and Mr Smith who leaves his house in the morning and collapses on his way to the bus stop.\"</p> <p>The new system is being introduced partly as a result of an inquiry into how the GP <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/shipman\" title=\"\">Harold Shipman</a> managed to kill a suspected 260 people without authorities detecting his actions. Shipman, from Hyde, in Greater Manchester, was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for murdering 15 patients.</p> <p>Fletcher said he did not believe changes would automatically prevent another such case, \"although they might detect him or her more quickly\". Changes would flag up clinical concerns, even where matters were not referred to a coroner.</p> <p>\"Let's say there is someone who has died from a very natural illness or disease, but some doses of medication were missed or observations were not recorded or acted on in a timely matter, I will discuss that with the coroner even if it might have no part in causing death, but then pass the concern to clinical governance systems if the coroner decides not to investigate.</p> <p>\"It is uncommon to come across something that is jaw-dropping. Catastrophic mistakes are usually recognised and reported but subtle things that are not immediately apparent may have a bearing for clinical governance.\"</p> <p>Feedback from doctors had been \"almost universally positive\", he said. Relatives appreciated the accuracy and explanation of medical terminology \"as well as the reassurance that someone independent has taken a look and asked if there were any concerns\".</p> <p>The public health minister Anne Milton said the reforms \"will improve the accuracy and robustness of information we record on the causes of death. This is not only important for families but will help with public health surveillance and local health service planning. Critically it will also help with the early detection of poor-quality care.\"</p> <p>Information garnered from the pilot scheme would be published soon.</p> <p>A row with local government over how the changes will be funded has overshadowed the plans. The <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_133693.pdf\" title=\"\">health secretary, Andrew Lansley, is determined the cost will not be met by taxpayers</a> but recognises it would be \"unfortunate\" if a new <a href=\"http:///www.theguardian.com/society/2011/sep/13/councils-death-tax-backlash-fees\" title=\"\">\"death tax\" on bereaved families collected by councils</a> were to turn the public against local authorities. He has asked officials to reconsider funding options.</p>",
  "<p>The Highways Agency is trialling combining GPS data with data from its existing sources to provide 'real time' information to drivers on a <a href=\"http://ntis.trafficengland.com\" title=\"\">'beta' version</a> of its traffic information map for drivers in England.</p> <p>A spokesman for the agency told Government Computing that by adding GPS data to that from its existing sources - induction loops under the road which count traffic and ANPR cameras - it aims to \"dramatically\" improve information about road conditions.</p> <p>\"The trial gathers live data from fleet vehicles, such as those belonging to haulage companies, that have GPS systems, plus a small element of data from apps, if individuals agree to provide this,\" he said.</p> <p>He added that all the data is anonymised by the agency and that no individual, vehicle or device can be identified so that only data about traffic levels on a road is provided.</p> <p>The 12 month project was launched in the spring. The costs are built into the agency's National Traffic Information Service contract, let last September to a joint venture between Mouchel and Thales.</p> <p>A parallel trial on the M25 is using anonymous location data from mobile phones to measure journey times.

  "<h2>Barnsley </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Jacob Butterfield departed Oakwell for the lure of Premier League football. Another notable departure was that of veteran striker Andy Gray. Jay McEveley, Alastair Taylor, David Cotterill, David Preece and Nathan Doyle all left the club after a season on the fringes of the squad last time out. Reds manager Keith Hill loves his broken toys. Polish midfielder Tomasz Cywka finds himself under his wing now. He was described by his former manager Nigel Clough as \"an inexperienced and not very bright footballer\" \u2013 it's time for Hill to work his Vaz Te magic again. Returning to the club is Jacob Mellis on a two-year contract. Goalkeeper Ben Alnwick has joined on a free transfer. Fans will have to wait until November to see \"marquee signing\" Mido make his first competitive start for Barnsley, after he suffered a serious hamstring rupture in pre-season. Fans are already questioning his fitness to compete in the Championship this season.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>An inspired billionaire to become club benefactor. To be rid of the tag of being perennial strugglers. To have a squad that is competing and demonstrating a capacity to develop even further in the Championship.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Proper skintage. Periods of abject misery, punctuated by thrills, spills and derby victories. A paltry 30 seconds worth of coverage on the Football League Show each weekend. More players sold for a fiver and a bag of wine gums. But, maximum effort and honesty from Keith Hill throughout.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Paul Digby, another product of our academy, will start to establish himself this season in midfield.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish </strong>Top half of the bottom half, somewhere between 13th and 18th.</p> <p><strong>Ian Wilkinson, </strong><a href=\"http://www.onthepontyend.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>On The Ponty End</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/OnThePontyEnd\" title=\"\"><strong>@onthepontyend</strong></a><strong>) </strong></p> <h2>Birmingham City </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>It's been a summer of change; a new management team and changes at board level have contributed to lots of talk about what will happen next. However, the transfer embargo has now been lifted and things appear to be returning to something approaching normality at St Andrews. Personnel-wise whilst a few have left the club they were in the main fringe players and as such the spine of the team remains the same. A couple more loan deals and Blues will have a team that really could compete in the top reaches of the Championship.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>A continuation of some of the exciting football of last year will satisfy many, although I think now that the expectation to go one step further and get promotion this season is also on the menu.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get</strong> Judging by what I've seen in pre-season there is a good chance that they will get what they want. Lee Clark seems to have understood that the team played well last year and the strong points within the team are still there \u2013 so he's not changed much, just added to it.</p> <p><strong>One to watch</strong> Obvious I know, but third-choice England and first-choice Team GB keeper Jack Butland has the No1 shirt and everyone expects him to be the bright new thing this year. However, my personal tip is young American defender/midfielder Will Packwood who has had an impressive pre-season.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> I'm loathe to jinx this so I'm going to be deliberately vague; provided we keep the squad we have together, we keep injuries and suspensions to a workable level and the effects from Carson Yeung's impending trial etc don't affect us too much then we'll be there or thereabouts come May.</p> <p><strong>almajir, </strong><a href=\"http://www.oftenpartisan.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>oftenpartisan.co.uk</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/often_partisan\" title=\"\"><strong>@often_partisan</strong></a><strong>) </strong></p> <h2>Blackburn Rovers </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> It's actually been, shock of all horrors, quite a productive summer at Blackburn Rovers after suffering relegation last time out. In have come Danny Murphy, Leon Best (injured already), Nuno Gomes, F\u00e1bio Nunes, Edinho Junior and Paulo Jorge, with Dickson Etuhu looking likely to follow. Out have gone Yakubu and Junior Hoilett \u2013 no Mr Kean, he's not signing a new deal in 48 hours, join the rest of us in the real world. On the whole this is probably about as much as we could have realistically asked for given the previous penny pinching behaviour of the owners Venky's and it does give us a shot at a swift return to the promised land of the Premier League.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Ideally first and foremost promotion coupled with the complete turning around of a proverbial ship that has been sinking for the best part of 18 months. For fans to unite instead of bickering constantly, for the owners to actually talk to the fans and if we're being picky \u2026 a new manager please.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get</strong> An underachievement on what is actually possible given the potential of a very strong squad in relative Championship terms. We'll be good at times, we'll concede goals for fun at times and you know who (manager, Scottish, likes excuses) will spend all season trying to find things other than himself and the owners to blame for defeats.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Look out for new signing F\u00e1bio Nunes who raised a merited \"WHO?\" upon being signed this summer but has looked like a star in the making out on the wing in pre-season, Also a quick glance towards youth academy prospect Adam Henley wouldn't hurt the eyes.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>I shall say fifth and in a play-off spot. Contrary to the doom merchants predictions I can't see Salesman Steve lasting this season if he gets off to a less than stellar start. The playing staff will be too strong for the division at times so I expect bare minimum a top-six finish.</p> <p><strong>Mike Delap </strong><a href=\"http://www.thewildblackburnrover.com/\" title=\"\">The Wild Blackburn Rover </a></p> <h2>Blackpool </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> It's been a quiet summer with only four players coming in up to now. No doubt there will be a few more players to come in before the deadline, probably forwards. On the way out are Bloomfield Road legends Brett Ormerod and Keith Southern leaving memories that will stay with the faithful for a lifetime. The former moving in to the end of his career with Wrexham, whilst the latter has sealed a move to Huddersfield which makes sense for all parties. From a playing perspective the side had started to evolve a little towards the end of last season and that should continue in terms of team shape whilst the style will remain as attacking as ever. Unless something changes in the next few weeks, the defence will remain a relative weakness.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>The greatest optimists would love to see the chairman lose his crushing rationality and sanction a whole host of big money signings to embellish the team that finished last season strongly. Before going on to emulate Reading's achievements last season and winning the title with games to spare.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Most rational fans would love a repeat of last season, but the Championship is a very different beast this year. Lots of money and changes at other clubs means that the league is as wide open as ever. 'Pool will start slowly, picking up momentum as loan signings boost the playing squad injecting vigour during the stagnant winter months.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>At the end of last season Angel Martinez broke through, this time around his Iberian team mate Tiago Gomes may well steal the headlines with his attacking talent.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> fifth.</p> <p><strong>John Kane, </strong><a href=\"http://www.tangerinedreaming.com\" title=\"\"><strong>Tangerine Dreaming</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/tanger_dreaming\" title=\"\"><strong>@Tanger_Dreaming</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Bolton Wanderers </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>We've kept much of the previous squad together and nobody's broken a leg this time around so we're relatively happy. Ivan Klasnic and Jussi Jaaskelainen have moved on, but they'd become bench warmers so Gretar Steinsson and Nigel Reo-Coker are the only regulars to depart. Andy Lonergan looks good as Jussi's replacement with Matt Mills and Keith Andrews looking decent and experienced signings to help fill the gaps left behind (though midfield also needs a Fabrice Muamba-style battler signing up). They're hardly glamorous signings but should add backbone to a team that was all-too-often spineless last season. Benik Afobe also arrives on loan as the latest Arsenal youngster for Coyle's 'finishing school'. He didn't score many on loan at Huddersfield but got rave reviews so we're hopeful he'll be good competition up front. Returns for Lee Chung-yong , Stuart Holden and Tyrone Mears will also be like new signings (as the clich\u00e9 goes).</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Some fans fancy we'll walk it this year, perhaps hoping the time has finally come for the many 'Championship-level' signings we seem to have made in recent years. If all goes as well as we might hope Marvin Sordell will finish as the division's leading goal scorer, we'll win shedloads of games and be champions by April.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Nothing like such a walk in the park unfortunately. We'll probably get some stuttering performances along the way and a real fight to prove our worth and to earn back a place in the Premiership, a league we've called home for 11 years running.</p> <p><strong>One to watch</strong> Young Josh Vela stepped up from our academy not long ago and could make a real impact this season. Having had a brief taste of Premier League football the busy midfielder is sure to be giving his all in a bid to earn a return.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>We might have said top four, but after the omnishambles of our pre-season perhaps top six. We'd love to think we're bang on for automatic promotion but we have to accept that play-offs are a distinct possibility, and with them many a racing pulse.</p> <p><strong>Geoff and Chris</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.themeninwhite.com/\" title=\"\">The Men in White </a> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/themeninwhite\">@themeninwhite</a>)</p> <h2>Brighton &amp; Hove Albion </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>How times have changed at Brighton. Tellingly, this summer's first three signings came from Manchester United, Manchester City and Valencia. The club has rarely, if ever, held such lofty ambitions. More quality was needed at fullback, where Gus Poyet has brought in Wayne Bridge, and Bruno Saltor (59 appearances in three years at Valencia). Tomasz Kuszczak has arrived to improve the options in goal and Welsh international Andrew Crofts returns after a two-year spell at Norwich, reinforcing the midfield. Most importantly, the club have managed to keep creative hub Vicente \u2013 now they just have to keep him fit.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>An improvement on last season's 10th place. Only nine teams scored fewer goals in last season's Championship, so the key is finding a way to coax more goals from Ashley Barnes and Craig Mackail-Smith, or to dip into the transfer market again.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>The club's aspirations are clear and the summer's transfer activity shows that the financial clout is there to realise them. Last season was our highest league finish in over 20 years, but all the signs (on and off the pitch) suggest that it's not unrealistic to expect further improvement.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>20-year-old Brighton-born Lewis Dunk. A strong, swift and stylish central defender whose classy performances earned him a call-up to the England U21s last year.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> In the top eight, if we can score 10-15 more goals than last year.</p> <p><strong>Andrew West (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/thegreatwesty\" title=\"\"><strong>@thegreatwesty</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Bristol City </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>This was the summer when Financial Fair Play hit Bristol with a vengeance. Bad, injury-prone or swiftly declining players on disproportionately lucrative deals all found the exit door open, to be replaced with younger, more versatile (and yes, cheaper) players. The exception is Jody Morris, back for a final crack at the English game after developing into Derek McInnes' on-field lieutenant at St. Johnstone. With a signing or two more still expected, McInnes appears to be creating a fast, attack-minded side that can assume a number of tactical guises depending on the opponents. After season upon season of stagnation, such an approach will be more than welcome in BS3.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Let's start with not losing 3-0 at home quite as often and work from there. More goals, more fight and more attractive football would all be good. A team to enjoy watching, with youth (ideally home-grown) to the fore. Far fewer journeymen, far fewer capitulations. This correspondent would kill for a cup run, too, but let's not run before we can walk.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>A work in progress, one would imagine. McInnes hasn't been able to make long-standing contracts go away, and we're still lumbered with a lot of expensive dead wood. Until we know whether a new stadium is in our future, we'll be working on a tight budget so success in a division full of parachute payments will be limited. But we can expect a genuine sense of purpose, something that's been missing since Gary Johnson ran out of steam in his third season at this level.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Cole Skuse. He's been with the club forever, playing over 250 times, but at 26 this technically-adept midfielder could finally make an impact on the division. With a strong range of passing, good head for the game and perhaps even the odd goal or two, Cole may well become one of the Championship's best midfielders.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> I hate writing \"mid-table\" as that often means \"I think we might go down but can't say it\". But I really do expect us to finish in that moderate-becoming-poor 12th-18th space. McInnes' record last season was strong enough that we can expect something more than another grim relegation battle, but in a tough, tough division I can't see us finishing above more than 10 teams or so this time round.</p> <p><strong>Will Jones, </strong><a href=\"http://totheleftofross.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>To The Left of Ross </strong></a><strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/will_totheleft\" title=\"\"><strong>@will_totheleft</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Burnley </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Better than last year. Most of our budget went on Jason Shackell and he's taken the armband too. He should add stability to the back four. Other additions are mostly to add depth to the squad with the likes of Sam Vokes arriving, although young winger George Porter and left-back Joseph Mills sound exciting. We've not been able to bring in the midfielder(s) we need yet, but haven't lost anyone important apart from Jay Rodriguez, who joined Southampton early in the summer for \u00a37 million.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Not to have our season derailed by selling star players in August/January for a change would be nice, a promotion challenge with a faster tempo on the pitch would be even better. A homegrown star in the side to replace Rodriguez. To beat Blackburn Rovers and Owen Coyle's Bolton Wanderers.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Another inconsistent campaign unless we sign a midfielder. Not enough quality in there at the moment. Brian Stock has been linked and he'd be a good addition. Perhaps a good run in one of the cups. Charlie Austin scoring a hatful of goals. Two defeats against Rovers, even if Sir Steve of Kean is still in charge.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>George Porter is being played down by Eddie Howe, but I'm hoping he'll have an impact this season. He adds pace and skill from the bench, hopefully a game-changing talent.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> I can't see us being close to either end of the table. As long as we're nearer the top six than the bottom six, most fans will be happy enough.</p> <p><strong>Jamie Smith, </strong><a href=\"http://nonaynever.net/\" title=\"\"><strong>NoNayNever.net</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/nonaynevernet/\" title=\"\"><strong>@nonaynevernet</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Cardiff City </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Well where do we begin? The club has turned from blue to red! Players coming, players going... it's been one of the most crazy and bizarre pre-seasons we've known. I will say for the record that I am fully behind the rebrand but purely because of the longevity it brings the club. After all, we're already seeing the benefits of the investment with the quality of signings such as Jordon Mutch, Kim Bo-kyung and, imminently, Craig Bellamy.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>The same as normal: promotion. Last season was seen as Malky Mackay's honeymoon period but after such a great first season coupled with the quality of players we've brought in, the famous Cardiff City pressure is bound to be out in spades.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get</strong> Probably a loss in the play-offs \u2026 for a change (sad but true). It's such a tough season to call but we have a superb squad for a change and we have for me the best manager in the league so I'd like to think we'll clinch promotion.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>I think we're all really interested to see what Kim Bo-kyung is capable of. From what we've seen at the Olympics with South Korea, he looks a superb asset. Another prospect is young Kadeem Harris who looks to have some very raw potential.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish </strong>There are some big hitters in the Championship this season and although I'd love to say we'll finish top two, I believe that third or fourth is more than likely.</p> <p><strong>Steve Davies-Evans, Cardiff City fan</strong></p> <h2>Charlton Athletic </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Lawrie Wilson from Stevenage, Jordan Cook from Sunderland have signed with Paul Hayes and Leon Clarke being made available for transfer. Back-up keeper, John Sullivan, is available for a long term loan and if he does move, the club will need to bring in a deputy for Ben Hamer. Central defender, Dorian Dervite, is currently on trial while rumours persist that the Addicks want to sign Sam Baldock. Player Of The Year, Chris Solly, is atracting interest from Premier League clubs. The Addicks still have business to do.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>A major signing or two and a campaign similar to the ones mounted by Norwich and Southanpton \u2014 the sides relegated with Charlton on 2009 \u2014 in the last two seasons would be nice. If Chris Powell is able to continue his rebuilding job and the club continues to progress, the fans will be happy.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>There have been rumours of problems behind the scenes during the summer. Consolidation, a mid-table finish without any flirtation with relegation would be a realistic aim. If the odd quality signing can be made, the play-offs could be a possibility.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>With seven subs again being allowed in the Football League this season, former Darlington striker, Michael Smith, may get a chance to shine from the bench.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish </strong>Mid-table.</p> <p><strong>Ketts, </strong><a href=\"http://www.doctorkish.com\" title=\"\"><strong>Doctor Kish </strong></a></p> <h2>Crystal Palace </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Yawn. It's not been a terribly exciting summer. For once. The most exciting change so far has been the new kit, designed by a Palace fan with a Barcelona style yellow trim. It looks well sexy. Player-wise, we've lost Nathaniel Clyne, Darren Ambrose, Sean Scannell and a few others but signed just three (Joel Ward and Aaron Wilbraham with Aaron Martin coming in on loan from Southampton) with more expected. There was, though, this ageing chap called Dougie Freedman who had a cameo against Dulwich Hamlet and looked decent. Anyone know his contract status?</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>A shot at the play-offs, or at the very least a top 10 finish. That or another decent cup run \u2013 last season's trip to Cardiff for the semi-finals (as well as the quarter-final win at Old Trafford) left Eagles fans wanting more scalps. The money helps too.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Probably a league finish of about 15th, maybe top half at a push. Which wouldn't be terrible and would still signal (slow) progress under Freedman. A cup run again would be nice, maybe we could beat Brighton in the quarter-final this time, please?</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>How much space am I allowed? The academy is brimming with talent at the moment; but expect young Kyle de Silva \u2013 a tricky left-winger \u2014 to make the break through this season. Especially as we currently have no other left wingers.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish </strong>15th, having taken one big scalp in the cup, and having beaten all of our local rivals (Brighton, Charlton and Millwall) at least once each.</p> <p><strong>James Daly, </strong><a href=\"http://www.fiveyearplanfanzine.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Five Year Plan</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/FYPFanzine\" title=\"\"><strong>@FYPFanzine</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Derby County </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> The big story was the sale of Jason Shackell to Burnley for seemingly little profit. Thirty season ticket holders even asked about getting their money back after that! We've spent most of the money on his replacement Richard Keogh and the fans seemed to have calmed down with the addition of a few younger players who will strengthen us. At the time of writing, we still haven't signed a new striker, highlighted as a priority by Clough. Last season's top scorer, Steve Davies, is on the transfer list after declining a new contract and could leave imminently.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>The Rams to play high-tempo, attacking football, keep it tight at the back and score plenty of goals. For the team to learn from the mistakes of last season so that a play-off place is well within our reach.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>The Rams will play high-tempo, attacking football, leak loads of soft goals and miss loads of chances. We will fail to convert tight games into victories and will have a frustratingly average mid-table finish.</p> <p><strong>One to watch</strong> Will Hughes is a brilliant young midfielder who will be around the first team squad this season, along with Mason Bennett who made his debut last season aged 15 but has now left school!</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>in the top 10.</p> <p><strong>Stewart Smith, </strong><a href=\"http://ramspaceuk.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Ramspace</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/cspaceram\" title=\"\"><strong>@cspaceram</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Huddersfield Town </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>So far this summer, Huddersfield Town have done some very tidy business. Although none of the signings are box office, they are young, talented and arrive from other clubs with very favourable reviews. Out if the signings so far, young midfielders Oliver Norwood and Adam Clayton look like they will offer the dynamism and passing ability we have so often lacked in midfield, but there hasn't been a disappointing buy so far. There have been no unexpected departures, although despite offering to drive them to new clubs myself, we've still not been able to dispose of Antony Kay and John McCombe.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>I suppose the true optimist would hope we can follow Southampton and Norwich into the Premier League the year after promotion from League One. The more cautious optimist will hope that Jordan Rhodes stays and that we compete week in week out.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>I expect us to have an early wake-up call where we look a bit shellshocked, before we find our feet in the league. It is unrealistic to expect that we'll compete in the upper echelons of the league, but if the team can gel then we will surprise a few people and probably finish mid-table.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>After his play-off heroics, I'd like to think Alex Smithies can overcome his injury woes and have a strong season. He's got every attribute a good goalkeeper needs, he just needs to put all the pieces together and show what he's capable of.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>I'm thinking about 14th which I would be absolutely delighted with. We currently do not have the infrastructure or fan base to make any appearance in the top flight anything more than a brief flirtation. After an 11-year exile from this division if we finish above the relegation places we should be delighted. This is a season that should be enjoyed and relished.</p> <p><strong>Charlie Johnson, </strong><a href=\"http://footballcharlie.footballunited.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>FootballCharlie</strong></a><strong> </strong>(<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/footballcharlie\" title=\"\">@FootballCharlie</a>)</p> <h2>Hull City </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Nick Barmby's sacking, and the nature of it, appalled many. Unhappiness at the owners was widespread, both for their actions and the style of them. Brusquely dispensing with a local legend was never going to be popular. Since then, the mood has improved greatly. An experienced manager in Steve Bruce was recruited, a better appointment than we really anticipated. He's been given money to spend, and his summer signings of Ben Amos, Eldin Jakupovic, Nick Proschwitz, Abdoulaye Faye, Alex Bruce and Sone Aluko should add both goals and experience to what was already an exciting young squad. Providing our existing stars are retained, chiefly James Chester and Robert Koren, the future looks suddenly bright.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Goals. Despite finishing eighth last season and spending much of it in the top six with a beautiful style of play, a chronic lack of goals undid City at the death. That deficiency is being addressed by Steve Bruce, and if done so successfully, it should only take a small improvement to turn \"nearly\" into \"there\". The top six is definitely on the agenda, though some are peering even higher \u2026</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>City are strong candidates for the play-offs. The squad is coming together nicely and the manager has experience of taking teams up, so it'd be a disappointment not to still be in with a chance come April. The top two doesn't quite feel achievable, but we ought to win more than we lose.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>James Chester's already broken through and is among the division's best defenders \u2013 what we want to watch is whether he can retain those high standards. If so, he's Premier League-bound \u2013 hopefully with City\u2026</p> <p><strong>We'll finish </strong>Between fifth and eighth.</p> <p><strong>Andy Dalton, </strong><a href=\"http://ambernectar.org/\" title=\"\"><strong>Amber Nectar</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/Amber__Nectar\" title=\"\"><strong>@Amber__Nectar</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Ipswich Town </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>The exits of former captain Grant Leadbitter and Lee Bowyer at the end of last season weren't universally mourned, while more fans were sad to see Ibrahima Sonko on his way and wouldn't mind Celtic loanee Daryl Murphy returning on a permanent basis. With the process of recruitment still very much ongoing, so far we've added former Forest centre-half Luke Chambers, promising ex-Macclesfield right-back Elliott Hewitt, keeper Scott Loach, a boyhood Town fan, from Watford and on-loan Tottenham man Massimo Luongo. Pre-season has seen us lose to Luton and Southend and beat West Ham within the same week. No one knows quite what to think yet.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Even the most optimistic supporters accept that the squad is lacking in depth and not really up to a challenge for the automatic places. In or around the play-offs is the extent of hopes at present.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>That's probably not too far off if we add a few players to be the squad between now and the end of the month and if key players avoid injuries. At the same time, if things don't go entirely to plan, it could be yet another season spent in the lower reaches of mid-table.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>On the basis of pre-season, Luongo looks likely to make a big impact, but in terms of players who are actually ours, 16-year-old Byron Lawrence made his debut on the final day of last season and is likely to be involved more during this campaign. The diminutive midfielder, who Paul Jewell has described as a \"Jack Wilshere-type player\", needs to get used to the physical aspects of the Championship but is tipped for big things.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> It's tempting to say 15th as we always seem to be 15th these days but I'll go for a more glass-half-full sixth-to-ninth, which would constitute progress in the right direction after several seasons of stagnation.</p> <p><strong>Phil Ham, </strong><a href=\"http://www.twtd.co.uk\" title=\"\"><strong>twtd.co.uk</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/twtduk\" title=\"\"><strong>@twtduk</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Leeds United </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> Neil Warnock promised huge changes this summer and despite a pending takeover making things difficult for the Leeds United manager, there has been plenty of comings and goings at Elland Road. The biggest loss is Robert Snodgrass which was a huge blow to Warnock's preparations, it's impossible to overstate how much he'll be missed. There are some positives however, most notably the defence where the likes of Adam Drury, Jason Pearce and Paddy Kenny have been added, which will hopefully provide a desperately needed improvement on last seasons defensive record.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want</strong> We want promotion. Not just the fans, but the manager and players too. Neil Warnock was brought in for that very reason and anything less than promotion back to the Premier League would be considered a failure by the majority.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get</strong> It's difficult to say. The squad looks solid enough from a defensive perspective, but it lacks game-changing individuals like Robert Snodgrass that are so often the difference between one and three points. We're a couple of signings short of being serious contenders in my opinion.</p> <p><strong>One to watch</strong> Fresh off the seemingly endless conveyor belt of talent that is Leeds United's Thorp Arch Academy, Sam Byram has made a huge impression on fans in pre-season and looks to have an exciting future ahead \u2013 which means he'll probably be a Norwich player by the end of January.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish</strong> The most important thing this summer was to improve the defence, and in that respect, it looks to have been a success. Unfortunately, we don't appear to have enough quality depth elsewhere or the attacking options to sustain a promotion challenge. I remain hopeful that something will change in the next week or so, but as things stand, I predict a 12th placed finish for The Whites. </p> <p><strong>David Wilkinson, </strong><a href=\"http://www.thescratchingshed.com\" title=\"\"><strong>The Scratching Shed</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/ScratchingShed1\" title=\"\"><strong>@TSSLUFC</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Leicester City </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> Nigel Pearson's clear-out has continued. At the back the excitable Sol Bamba, the inconsistent Matt Mills and the almost ever-present but unfancied Lee Peltier have all gone. In their place arrive players looking to establish themselves in the shape of Ritchie de Laet and Zak Whitbread. Up front Jamie Vardy's outrageous goalscoring record in non-league football has earned him a record breaking \u00a31m move three divisions up the league ladder. He'll be competing for a place alongside David Nugent with Jermaine Beckford who, to the surprise of some, remains in the camp. Sven thought experienced heads would do the job last term. It looks like Pearson is doubling down on youth and hunger.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want</strong> Promotion. This is Leicester's ninth season outside the top flight and you have to go back to the 1920's to find a City side away from English football's top table for so long. Please let this be the year.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Matches to die for, followed by maddening inconsistency. Pearson will be done over tactically at least a few times this season (he always is). But what matters is if he's rediscovered the formula that saw Leicester win more games by a single goal (14) than any other Championship side in 2009-10.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Undeterred by the Yann Kermogant affair, Pearson has dipped into Ligue 2 again and signed France Under-20 winger Anthony Knockaert. Apparently Newcastle were interested in him.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> Annoyingly close to automatic promotion, perform heroically in the playoff semi-final until the match goes to penalties and Knockaert attempts a Panenka \u2026 probably.</p> <p><strong>Mike McCarthy, </strong><a href=\"http://foxblogger.wordpress.com\" title=\"\"><strong>Foxblogger</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/foxblogger\" title=\"\"><strong>@foxblogger</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Middlesbrough </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Compared to recent years there's been a veritable feast of new signings this summer, Grant Leadbitter, Mustapha Carayol, George Friend, Emanuel Jorge Ledesma and old boy Stuart Parnaby have all been added to our ranks. In the opposite direction goes Barry Robson plus three of our home grown stars in Jonathan Franks, Jonathan Grounds and Tony McMahon. The loss of those academy products seems to suggest Mowbray won't be swayed by sentimentality during his rebuilding process. In addition to those bits of business we all gave a collective shrug and said \"meh\" to the inconsequential loss of Malaury Martin, Bart Ogbeche, Danny Coyne and Adam Hammill. But for all these comings and goings the 'story of the summer' has undoubtedly been the capture of Jonathan Woodgate. I can't help feeling that \"as long as he can stay fit\" will become a slightly overused phrase over the next few months. With club captain Matthew Bates already a long term absentee, Woodgate is certainly a gamble but one most other Championship clubs would have jumped at given half the chance.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>A full season out of Woodgate is an absolute must. It would be nice to see the goals shared around with less of a reliance on Marvin Emnes. If the new boys can complement our crop of emerging youngsters then we should see a more balanced team and one that plays with a bit more width, freedom and expression. People have been waiting patiently to see a team with the Mowbray stamp on it and this could well be it. A return to some +20,000 crowds at the Riverside would also be a welcome addition, but I'd settle for getting Kevin Thomson off the wage bill as a close second.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>A huge chorus of \"you see, what did I tell you\" as Woodgate breaks down on the opening day. Seriously though, its difficult not to be positive about the coming season. I don't think we'll walk the league or even go up as champions but I do believe we could be in for some very entertaining football over the next few months.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Cameron Park and Adam Reach have both been promising to break through for a while now, Reach in particular has really impressed during pre-season. That said, if Curtis Main continues where he left off last season he could well be the name on everyone's lips.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>Last season my prediction was just one place out, so buoyed by that unnerving accuracy I'm going stick my neck out and say we will finish fourth this time round.</p> <p><strong>Steve Welsh, </strong><a href=\"http://miniboro.com\" title=\"\"><strong>MiniBoro</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/miniboro_dotcom\" title=\"\"><strong>@miniboro_dotcom</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Millwall </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> Undoubtedly influenced by last season's slow start, we've been quick to address some of the squad's weaknesses in signing Bournemouth wing back Scott Malone and winger Chris Taylor from Oldham. Karleigh Osborne was also brought in to augment the defensive options on offer after turning down a new contract with Brentford, and veteran goalkeeper Maik Taylor joined permanently following a successful loan spell from Leeds. In terms of the departures, Hamer Bouazza left for AC Omonia, defender Tony Craig signed with Brentford for an undisclosed fee, and Josh McQuoid returned to his former club Bournemouth as part of the deal to bring in Malone.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>The conclusion of last season indicated that this side could have probably done better than spending much of the campaign flirting with relegation. More than anything, I think most of us are hoping that it doesn't take until March for the players to show what they're truly capable of.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Producing the kind of form we took into April for months on end seems more than a little unlikely, but I don't see why we can't improve upon our overall consistency. While it might not end in glory, this season should hopefully be less arduous than the previous one.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Forward Shaun Batt, who's been injured for the best part of two years, will almost be like a new signing for us. I'm really interested to see how he gets on.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish\u2026</strong> I think we have enough to avoid the drop, but don't see us properly competing with the pacesetters. A top-half finish is probably the best we can hope for, though mid-table seems more realistic.</p> <p><strong>Charlie Mahoney, Millwall fan (</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/THRIIIIKER\" title=\"\"><strong>@THRIIIIKER</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Nottingham Forest </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> It was all about the takeover for us \u2013 the Al Hasawi family were long linked with a move to acquire Forest from the estate of Nigel Doughty, eventually this happened and the new owners have proven popular with fans. Not least for meeting Steve Cotterill and sacking him hours later. After much speculation they sprung a surprise by placing Sean O'Driscoll in charge (who was, weeks before the takeover, a Forest employee of course). It's come at the cost of disrupting our preseason, we've lost a few players and signed some \u2014 but not quite enough yet to have a comfortable size of squad.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Most seem content with our approach of rebuilding sensibly and shrewdly with a manager who promises to deliver the kind of football we want to see. Some want to see the new owners spunk money left, right and centre despite the kind of warning signs we have seen recently at the two blue cities of Cardiff and Leicester (although Cardiff are red now aren't they?).</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>I think we'll have a season of consolidation \u2013 new signings will need time to bed in and gel, and the manager needs time to get his message across. Mid-table. And you know what? I'd be happy with that.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>I'm hoping that this will be the season that Jamaal Lascelles will be promoted to the first team squad \u2013 maybe not always a first choice, but I'd like to see him get some first team game time to kick on and develop his game.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> I'm expecting mid-table mediocrity \u2013 a slow start, and a better middle and finish with possibly half a sniff of being the late surgers into the play-offs (if I'm being quite wildly optimistic).</p> <p><strong>Ryan Brice, </strong><a href=\"http://nffcblog.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>NFFC Blog</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/nffcblog\" title=\"\"><strong>@NFFCblog</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Peterborough United </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> Posh have been fairly busy this summer bringing in: Bobby Olejnik (Torquay), Nathaniel Knight-Percieval (Wrexham), Danny Swanson (Dundee United), Michael Bostwick (Stevenage), Nathaniel Mendez-Laing (Wolves) and Johnson Clarke-Harris (Coventry). The signings show that the management team are sticking with the club's policy that has got them this far: bringing in young talent from the lower leagues. Of the new signings Swanson and Bostwick are the two that have created the most excitement around London Road. Swanson has had a lot of injury problems during his career so far, but has already caught the eye north of the border with his talent on the ball. Bostwick, on the other hand, is the exact sort of player Posh were missing last season. A physical presence, that never stops running, he has earned a reputation as one of the best midfielders in the lower divisions and Darren Ferguson will be hoping that he makes the step-up to the Championship with ease. Things have been quieter in terms of players going out. The very much divisive goalkeeping debate has been ended with both the club's first-team keepers from last season \u2013 Joe Lewis and Paul Jones \u2013 heading elsewhere, the former to Cardiff and the latter to Crawley. However, despite Posh having placed some talented players in the transfer list \u2013 including George Boyd, Paul Taylor and Grant McCann \u2013 there has been relatively little interest in the trio and all three still remain at the club.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Expectations haven't increased too much since last season. I think everybody would like to see the club simply consolidate in the division again. We managed to reach 50 points last season, bang on the initial target set by Ferguson. He and Darragh MacAnthony have constantly talked of moving the club forward slowly at this level so I expect that they are hoping to achieve around 60 points this campaign and most fans, too, would like to see some positive progress.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Unfortunately the Championship looks a stronger division this year. With Doncaster out of the division, we are the smallest club in the Championship by a greater margin and picking out three teams that, on paper, appear worse than us is a bit of a struggle. The key will be in how well the new signings settle in, but if we manage to stay in the division this season it will be a greater achievement than last campaign.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Joe Newell has come through the youth system at the club and looks an exciting talent. He was in and around the first-team squad last season and managed to score his first goal for the club against Leeds, towards the back end of the campaign. MacAnthony has said that he will play around 30 games this year, so there is a large amount of expectation on the 19-year-old's shoulders.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>I think we'll finish just above the relegation zone again. This season looks set to be a struggle, but the squad has increased in quality in certain areas and we should just about have enough to see us safe.</p> <p><strong>John Verrall, </strong><a href=\"http://posh.footballblog.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Peterborough United Football Blog</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/johnverrall\" title=\"\"><strong>@JohnVerrall</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Sheffield Wednesday </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>A strong summer where fringe players have been shown the door and Championship pedigree players have been welcomed. The signing of Chris Kirkland boosts Wednesday's already strong competition for the No1 shirt, which can only mean good things. The blow of not being able to sign promising youngster Danny Batth permanently was cushioned by the signing of experienced centre back Anthony Gardener. The long pursuit of Michail Antonio also finally came to an end too, with the pacey winger signing a four year deal. That's been a massive boost to players and fans alike.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Whispers of the Owls doing a Norwich or a Southampton will always echo throughout the message boards and the pubs of Sheffield. Wednesday would be in a better position to hit back-to-back promotions than Charlton or Huddersfield, but sadly I think that would be a step too far at the minute.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Everyone would happily take a mid-table finish, with the aim to build for next season and then push for the play-offs. The glut of good teams such as Bolton and Wolves who have come down from the Premier League and teams like Birmingham still lingering will mean a tricky season for all involved.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>If he starts most matches and manages to form a successful partnership with Gary Madine, I believe Chris Maguire will have a storming season for the Owls. He's a player that really has it all.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish </strong>I'm going to plump for 11th with a massive 58 points.</p> <p><strong>James Edwards, Sheffield Wednesday fan </strong></p> <h2>Watford </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> [Takes a deep breath] So. Our previous, somewhat worrying and unfathomable owner has sold the club to the Pozzo family, who also own Udinese (Italy) and Granada (Spain). Within minutes of their expensive Italian shoes hitting the tarmac in England, they had sacked Sean Dyche \u2013 his P45 the reward for steering us to our highest finish in years. His replacement is the unmistakable Gianfranco Zola, one of the greatest footballers the world has ever seen. Hornets fans are hoping we are yet to see his best as a manager. Since the takeover we've seen no fewer than seven new additions to the playing squad, with more almost certainly on the way. Oh, and last year's leading striker was jailed for 10 months, whilst cult hero Lloyd Doyley celebrated his testimonial year with a game against Spurs. Just an average close season in WD18 really.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>After several seasons of setting survival (both on the pitch and of it) as the only goal, Watford supporters could be forgiven for using the arrival of the Pozzo family as justification for training their sights on the top half of the division for a change. Outside of Watford, some media outlets are starting to talk of Watford and their illustrious backers as promotion contenders, but I think most regular watchers would settle for a season in which we play some of the decent football Zola has promised, whilst remaining comfortably clear of the drop zone.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Even the most grounded of Hornets will accept that the Pozzo family haven't got involved at Vicarage Road with a view to adding a mediocre Championship club to their stable. They want success and the stated target is the Premier League. They've made a success of Udinese and Granada, quickly in the case of the latter, but the second tier is a cruel mistress and will be tough to conquer. With a manager who lacks experience at this level and a host of new additions, creating a side that will challenge this time round looks tough. I think if the Hornets finish comfortable mid table, perhaps after flirting with the play-offs, no one will be too surprised.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>After an incredible end to last season, the cat is out of the bag with regards to Sean Murray, but I believe he'll shine again. Piero Mingoia, an Italian midfielder who has been at the club since he's 13, is one readers may not know much about. Not dissimilar in appearance to the new gaffer, this year may be his year. Also worth keeping an eye on the wonderfully named Britt Assombalonga, who last season was the 50th graduate from the Watford Academy to make a first team appearance.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish </strong>Hopefully with the same manager and owners. The club is craving stability. In terms of a league finish, I'm going to go for one better than last year. Tenth for the new look golden boys..</p> <p><strong>Mike Parkin, </strong><a href=\"http://www.fromtherookeryend.com\" title=\"\"><strong>From the Rookery End</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/rookerymike\" title=\"\"><strong>@RookeryMike</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2><strong>Wolves </strong></h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>As I write this the vultures are beginning to circle over our top talents. Steven Fletcher and Matt Jarvis are both likely to join Michael Kightly in leaving before the transfer window shuts and that will leave a gaping hole to fill. We've signed two strikers: Frank Nouble, a freebie from West Ham, and Bjorn Sigurdarson for a few million from Norway. Midfielder Tongo Doumbia has also arrived on a season long loan. It's really anyone's guess as to how the jigsaw will look when all the pieces are shifted around and put together again.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>An immediate return to the Premier League (automatically please) playing attractive football and re-energising the club after an horrific year both on and off the field. New manager Stale Solbakken seems to have a very clear idea how he wants us to play and if it comes off, there's no reason we shouldn't achieve our ultimate goal.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>A lot of faith is being placed in the manager's ability to build a team out of the wreckage. Lots of players are being moved on and those coming in seem like gambles. That said, it looks like Solbakken will be backed financially throughout the season, so there's no reason we shouldn't be around the top six as an absolute minimum.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>At lot is expected of Sigurdarson and he arrives with a decent reputation. Of our home grown talents, winger Zeli Ismael has been widely touted for a good while now. Hopefully this is his time.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>Top six is the minimum and I think that's about where we'll end up. I'd like to think we'd be in the automatic shake-up, but it could be the lottery of the play-offs. Fourth or fifth.</p> <p><strong>Thomas Baugh</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.wolvesblog.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Wolves Blog</strong></a></p>",
  "<h2>Bournemouth </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> After the histrionics of last season, the summer has seen a welcome focus on the footballing side. New manager Paul Groves has been stamping his mark on the club with a backroom reshuffle, and it has very much been a case of 'out with the old' \u2013 with long-serving Warren Cummings and Shaun Cooper being among the departees \u2013 and in with the new. If the aim has been to signal intent, then recent signings will have helped: Lewis Grabban and Eunan O'Kane both come from League Two chomping at the bit to prove they can cut it at a higher level; the returning Josh McQuoid has been scoring for fun in pre-season, and it's great to see last-season loanee Miles Addison return on a permanent basis. The most intriguing newcomer, however, has to be Dutch striker Frank Demouge from Utrecht. Unfortunately, since he's slated to go under the knife thanks to a recent knee injury, it could be a while before we actually see him.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Promotion. The playing side has been invested in on an unprecedented scale, and anything less than a playoff place would be seen as a failure.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Who knows? If the last few years have been anything to go by, anything could happen. Much will depend on Groves, who still has a lot to prove and the majority of supporters to win over. And after years living on the breadline, it's hard not to be a tad weary regarding the long-term \u2013 or indeed, the short term \u2013 viability of the club's current business model.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>After a number of seasons hampered by injury and interrupted by international call-ups, Joe Partington has a real opportunity to stake a claim for the central midfield berth, and could be this</p> <p>season's breakout player. If he stays fit, that is.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish </strong>With the money we've spent, play-offs should be the minimum expectation.</p> <p><strong>Steve Wright, Bournemouth fan (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/@stevewright22\" title=\"\"><strong>@stevewright22</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Brentford </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>After a steady first season in charge, Uwe Rosler strengthened his squad by bringing in Tony Craig from Millwall, Farid El Alagui from Falkirk and Adam Forshaw from Everton. Yet by far the biggest moment of the close season came when the club announced that owner Matthew Benham had purchased the land at Lionel Road, for a long time now the club's preferred site for a new stadium. After decades of waiting and many an artist's impression having gone to waste, it looks like we'll be leaving Griffin Park in the not too distant future, with the 2016-17 season already being mooted.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>More of the stylish football Rosler got the team playing at times last season, just with more cutting edge in the final third, consistency in terms of results and promotion to round things off. A win over Fulham in the FA Cup wouldn't be too bad either.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>As it's Brentford, probably broken dreams.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Big things were expected of Harry Forrester last year after he turned down Ajax to sign for the Bees (no, that's not a joke). After a stop-start first season at Griffin Park, Rosler has challenged the young midfielder to get fitter and nail down a regular starting place. The signs are good as Forrester has been on fire in pre-season and if he can fulfill his undoubted potential he could become a big player for us.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>My prediction of a play-off finish last season didn't come to fruition and I don't want to put the kibosh on our chances again but this time around we've got a stronger squad and League One's a little weaker, so a top six finish is achievable. Of course, if and when we get to the play offs we'll probably lose because that's what Brentford do.</p> <p><strong>Will Gore, Brentford fan </strong>(<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/WillGore\" title=\"\">@WillGore</a>)</p> <h2>Bury </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>The departure of manager Richie Barker just days before the season starts has thrown fan feeling into perplexing disarray regarding what to expect from the next few months. Before he left, Barker signed Marcus Marshall, Adam Lockwood and Lateef Elford-Aliyu (who had a successful loan spell with Bury last season) combined with the pre-announced signing of goalkeeper Trevor Carson, which didn't really cause much of a ripple. The saga of other goalkeeper Cameron Belford still lingers on after a much-predicted move to Southend fell through. Whatever any new manager might think about these players as well as the crop that remained is a mystery.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>No Bury fan can ever imagine promotion to be top of the agenda but I don't think we imagine it will be a scrap for survival either. Barker showed he was still learning the ropes of the job last season as he found his best XI and when he did we were entertaining.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Mediocrity all the way will personally suit me down to the ground. When we were good we were very good but when we bad we were awful last season. More of the former than the latter please. All of this is entirely dependent on who the board see fit to be the new man in charge though.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>David Worrall was very much the star man on the wing and unless a substantial bid comes in for him I imagine he will be this season too. Elford-Aliyu also has the makings of an important squad member.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish </strong>Mid-table finish with more people of the town getting down to support the club.</p> <p><strong>James Bentley, Bury fan (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/@JamesIsABuryFan\" title=\"\"><strong>@JamesIsABuryFan</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Carlisle United </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Some flux but not too much. With nine out of contract many feared a mass exodus but only three senior players left - Lubo Michalik and Tom Taiwo are still without clubs and Francois Zoko's shot at the big time stalled one place higher than our eighth last year - at Notts County. Not a popular move in Cumbria. Mike Edwards already looks an improvement on Michalik at centre-half while Danny Cadamarteri will add wiliness to a frontline over reliant on Lee Miller. Signing of the summer looks like being Italian left back Alessio Bugno, son of cycling great Gianni \u2013 he has already won the hearts of Brunton Park with an impressive pre-season.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>The delusional want automatic promotion but even the realists see a strong possibility of a play-off campaign in an open looking division. A bit more consistency and eradication of some of last year's four- and five-goal reverses would also go down well.</p> <p><strong>What they'll get </strong>For once I think the reality matches expectation. Our midfield three is amongst the league's best and last year's defensive toil looks fairer in pre-season. We still look a flair player short with Zoko gone and Jon-Paul McGovern and Rory Loy missing pre-season. Someone to help Lee Miller is still on the shopping list.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>For the first time in ages we have a few. Goalkeeper Mark Gillespie might unseat Adam Collin on pre-season form and Mark Beck's seven goals show promise; though his game sense and strength are not League One ready. Not so 18-year-old Brad Potts \u2013 the utility man looks likely to keep US international Frank Simek out at right-back and rumour persists that his one year neo-pro deal is swiftly being re negotiated.</p> <p><strong>Where will we finish? </strong>Last year I said seventh to 10th and so nearly was wrong in the right way so tempted there again. With the extra forward I'm convinced Greg Abbott will find I think we'll be in the top six.</p> <p><strong>John McGee, </strong><a href=\"http://www.keithmincher.com\" title=\"\"><strong>Bring Me the Head of Keith Mincher</strong></a><strong> </strong>(<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/epouvantail\" title=\"\">@epouvantail</a>)</p> <h2>Colchester United </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>It's been a relatively busy summer of movement both in and out at the club. Key names from last season, including Ben Williams, Steven Gillespie and player of the year Kayode Odejayi, have departed but Freddie Sears, Clinton Morrison and Marcus Bean have arrived as good replacements.<strong> </strong>Undoubtedly, the key moves of the window were convincing Magnus Okuonghae and John-Joe O'Toole that their futures lay in Essex.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>On paper, our squad is good enough to challenge for a play-off spot, with a good mix of youth and experience. All supporters wearing the blue and white stripes will be harbouring hopes of penetrating those places, after John Ward's side have come close in previous seasons.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>For once, the difference between an optimistic and realistic view is quite minimal. Clearly the likes of MK Dons, Sheffield United and Notts County will pose a threat, but the league is there for the taking.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>There are a number of youngsters given pro contracts who look to be good prospects, including Tosin Olufemi, All eyes will be firmly fixed on whether Sears can deliver his potential and how newly-anointed No1 keeper Mark Cousins performs.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>Sixth with 70 points.</p> <p><strong>Daniel Jolly, </strong><a href=\"http://www.skysports.com/fanzone/blogs/0,24024,11702,00.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Sky Sports Fanzone </strong></a></p> <h2>Coventry City </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Welcome to the sky blue merry-go-round. There's been the usual mix of out-of-contract assets able to leave the Ricoh for sod all (most noticeably Martin Cranie and Sammy Clingan), while fans' favourite Richard Keogh and young Gael Bigirimana have been pinched in exchange for what appear to be reasonably acceptable fees. Madly, the outgoing faces haven't really been the story of this particular summer. Andy Thorn has embarked on a Football Manager-style shopping spree \u2013 Kevin Kilbane, Stephen Elliott and John Fleck all joined the ranks in a flurry of summer activity, followed soon after by Callum Ball and Reece Brown from Derby and Manchester United respectively. We've also landed an intriguing French duo of Kevin Malaga and William Edjenguele. Nobody has any real idea how good they are, but YouTube tells us that they're actually footballers, which is nice.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Let's face it. This is League One and we don't want to be here. The sooner we can sort things out and get out of it, the sooner we can all stop weeping into our collective sky blue soup. We've brought in a bunch of players, many of whom would usually provide enough quality to challenge for promotion in some form. That's what the fans want. Is that realistic? Lord only knows.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>We're still fighting the relegation blues, and following a mixed (but often diabolical) pre-season, we're lacking a bit of positivity right now. What do all these personnel changes mean if we're still carrying the same lack of organisation seen last season? The likelihood is if we can't shake off the mediocrity soon, we're in for another frustrating season.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Even though the bigger names may have left, there are plenty who have the potential to step up and stand out this year. John Fleck comes with a reputation as a classy piece, while Cody McDonald has shown his prowess at this level. Personally, I'd keep an eye on young Conor Thomas as he establishes himself in the starting lineup. He's still very young, but having caught the eye of Liverpool a short while back, his League One credentials shouldn't be in doubt.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> Even with the inherent negativity of the last few months dragging us down, I still see us top half and pressing for those play-offs. I'm sorry to those who'll believe this to be lunacy, but anything less would be a bit of a horror, given the wealth of players joining the club. I hope the club knows that.</p> <p><strong>Neil Allison, </strong><a href=\"http://www.skybluesblog.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Sky Blues Blog</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/neilallison\" title=\"\"><strong>@neilallison</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Crawley Town </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>A word that could be used is \"hectic\". We've released the deadwood and brought in defender Mark Connolly from Bolton, Nicky Adams from Rochdale, Mat Sadler from Walsall, Paul Jones from Peterborough and signed Gary Alexander permanently. The new boys look good signings with Adams, Sadler and Jones impressing the most so far. We also brought in a \"new\" manager in Sean O'Driscoll, seen him leave for Nottingham Forest and get Richie Barker in from Bury; the new man at the helm for our maiden journey into the world of League One football!</p> <p><strong>What the fans want</strong> Depends if you're a newbie or not. The newer fans will probably want promotion again. The supporters that have been watching Crawley since the days of administration and playing at the likes of Gloucester City will take staying in the league... especially after this summer's activities!</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get</strong> Erm... not sure. Barker hasn't managed a game for us yet but I've heard good reports about his style. Don't expect us to mount a challenge at the top of the table but doubt we'll be fighting like beavers at the bottom either so probably mid-table or just outside the play-offs at a push \u2026 a tad optimistic?</p> <p><strong>One to watch</strong> Jonte Smith scored plenty of goals during his first season in our youth team and the Bermudan has been offered a professional contract with us. With our striker shortage at the moment, he will probably get a few games too.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish\u2026</strong> Between eighth and 15th.</p> <p><strong>Warren Lucy, </strong><a href=\"http://warrenlucy.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>The Goalmouth Scramble</strong></a></p> <h2>Crewe Alexandra </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>After ending last season with a play-off final win on the back of a 19 game unbeaten run, the good feeling continued over the summer with an unbeaten pre-season. Crewe have made five new signings: Mark Ellis and Gregor Robertson to strengthen the back four, Abdul Osman to add numbers in midfield, as well as Mathias Pogba and Michael West to provide more attacking options. The most high profile departure was Nick Powell, moving to Manchester United for an initial fee of \u00a34m. Among those also leaving were play-off winning captain David Artell (Port Vale) and midfielder Lee Bell (Burton).</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Crewe fans love to see good attacking football, so that'll be a priority. After the high at the end of last season every fan wants the team to push on further and have even more success, with another play-off campaign and trip to Wembley come May.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>They may not get another play-off campaign but they'll be guaranteed to see a side hold their own in a league above. Good football will be played throughout and a top-half finish is a real possibility, which can be regarded a good season for a newly promoted side.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>After Nick Powell's emergence last season everyone wants to know who's next. Max Clayton looks the most likely, an 18-year-old striker with England youth experience. Often described as a young Michael Owen, this season looks the time for Max to breakthrough.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> Top half of the table, with around 65 points.</p> <p><strong>Rob Dutton, Crewe fan</strong></p> <h2>Doncaster Rovers </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>'End of an era' probably sums up the close-season. A staggering 19 players have departed the club meaning that only 11 of the squad which ended our four-year Championship sojourn remain, and two of those, Brian Stock and Jamie Coppinger, are likely to leave before the month's end. Aside from youth team players offered pro contracts, thus far only four players have come the other way, Rob Jones, David Cotterill, Dave Syers and Robbie Blake and though each has looked promising in pre-season the high squad turnover means you can expect the most used word in Rovers' coverage next season to be 'transitional'. Still, it beats 'experiment'.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Personally I'd be delighted with a season of mid-table anonimity whilst the club seeks to stabilise itself once again. A quick shufty on one of the fans' messageboards suggests many would happily welcome Willie McKay back on board if he could offer us a player or two. Football eh?</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>The squad being so thin so close to the season's commencement points to it being something of an understandable struggle. A tough start, followed by an improvement as the players get to know each other petering out to a mid-table finish, with a disappointing cup exit along the way. In short, back to normality.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Six of last season's Alliance Cup winning youth team have now signed pro, with full-back James Husband the highest rated of the bunch.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> Unspectacularly, but in a better shape off the field than we were at the season's start.</p> <p><strong>Glen Wilson, (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/vivarovers\" title=\"\"><strong>@vivarovers</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Hartlepool United</h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Seven players have left the club which saw some long serving players (like James Brown, Gary Liddle and Adam Boyd) leave which then allowed manager Neale Cooper to free up wages to bring in some new players to the club. So far, Cooper has brought in three players: midfielder Simon Walton from Plymouth, pacy winger Jonathan Franks from Middlesbrough and striker Steve Howard who is now in his second spell with us and will be hoping to help cure the team's shyness in front of goal.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>We'd like to see a goalscorer at the club after seeing only four teams score less than us in League One last season (two of whom were relegated) and also for some consistency.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Howard brings experience to the club and has shown in pre-season what a handful he can be, however the big target man will need some good service to see him getting goals which we lacked last season but hopefully Franks, who can play on either wing, can provide some service.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>18-year-old left back Darren Holden has impressed whenever he's played for the first team and hopefully he'll be able to make an impact at Victoria Park this season.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>In my opinion, a mid-table finish for us.</p> <p><strong>David Jolly, Hartlepool fan</strong></p> <h2>Leyton Orient </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>After escaping relegation by the skin of our teeth last season, a drastic overhaul of the squad was hoped for and widely anticipated. Instead, Russell Slade has opted for a middle ground, with a few changes in each sector of the pitch. Out have gone the long-serving Terrell Forbes and Matthew Spring, the talented but raw George Porter, the disappointing Jamie Cureton, the frustrating Jonathan Tehoue and, thankfully, the cast of loanees and short-term contract players that were so inadequate last season. In come a range of solid-but-unspectacular newbies: Gary Sawyer, new captain Nathan Clarke and Mathieu Baudry in defence, Anthony Griffith and Lloyd James in midfield, and Michael Symes and Ryan Brunt up front. Encouragingly, all fill gaps that were so exposed last year, but worryingly, we look very low on creativity. Off the field, the continual moving of the goalposts by the authorities to make sure West Ham get the Olympic Stadium is hugely frustrating, although Barry Hearn's continual annoyance to those same authorities by refusing to cave in is, however, a joy to watch.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Given the signings and our general disposition towards Morrissey-levels of miserablism, most Os fans would probably be happy to avoid relegation. Paradoxically though, we also won't be happy with this \u2013 Slade needs a good start to repay the fans' backing through our end of season disaster run last time out, and if we're hovering around the dropzone at Christmas, the pressure may mount to breaking point.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>On paper, the squad looks solid enough to stay up, but it doesn't look like being pretty and a lot rests once again on Dean Cox to provide the assists. If he doesn't produce, we're in trouble. Given Uncle Barry's loyalty towards managers, lower mid-table, complaining supporters and an under-fire manager is likely.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Youth team graduate Moses Odubajo announced himself on the last game of the season with a beauty of a goal, hopefully he will be given a run on the wing to show what he can do. The 17-year-old Afolabi Obafemi has also impressed in pre-season, he could be our new ace in the pack.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish </strong>16th place. Out of the Carling Cup to Charlton, and beaten by Dagenham (again) in at least one of the other cups. West Ham will have the Olympic Stadium and be busy preparing to issue tickets for \u00a31 in our local area to fill it. It really is tough being so positive all the time.</p> <p><strong>Dave Fawbert, Leyton Orient fan (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/DaveFawbert\" title=\"\"><strong>@DaveFawbert</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>MK Dons </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>The most significant arrival is Alan Smith, who joined on loan last season due to an apparent appreciation for the club's, or more specifically manager Karl Robinson's, footballing ethos. He has signed permanently after his Newcastle contract expired and is likely to start the season leading the line up front. Jon Otsemobor was next in the door, and will replace last campaign's loanees Adam Smith and James Tavernier at right-back. At the time of writing, negotiations with a mystery centre-back were ongoing but the departure of Tom Flanagan to Gillingham for six months indicates that something in that department is nearing completion. It needs to be.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>After two seasons in the play-offs, the goal is the top two, particularly given that the division does not look quite as strong this season. If Smith gets a full pre-season under his belt and stays fit for a good amount of games thereafter, he should make more of a difference than he did while on loan.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Third or fourth. We've collected 77 and 80 points in our two seasons under Robinson \u2013 I expect an improvement of a few points again, but we'll have to hope that the trend of 90-point plus second-place sides ends if we want to have a chance of going up automatically.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Shaun Williams was outstanding late last season at centre-back, and particularly impressed in the play-offs. He is a central midfielder by trade, and his performances alone seem to have persuaded Robinson to switch from 4-2-3-1 to 4-3-3 to make room for him alongside Darren Potter and Stephen Gleeson.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> Top seed in the play-offs and hopefully, this time, at Wembley.</p> <p><strong>Oliver Platt, MK Dons fan</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mkdsa.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong> </strong></a></p> <h2>Notts County </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Keith Curle has worked diligently in the summer to ensure we won't be bullied this season. Signings like Enoch Showunmi and Gary Liddle stand out in the outfield \u2013 as does Francois Zoko who is possibly the most exciting signing I think we've made (barring the Munto summer) in years. Bartosz Bialkowksi could prove to be quite the coup in goal also. Meanwhile we've shipped a ton of deadwood out like Karl Hawley and John Spicer. Also gone is Ben Burgess \u2013 who lost a Wembley play-off final, signed for Tranmere and they still weren't the worst things to happen this summer as he took himself into retirement.<strong> </strong>Hard to read much into the pre-season games against non-league opposition in glorified training sessions. But when things stepped up against AEK Athens (and before the heavens opened) we looked great value for our 1-0 lead.<strong> </strong>Alan Judge's rumoured refusal to put pen to paper on a new contract is certainly a huge concern after his input last year, but if any money coming in from a potential sale went towards bringing back loanees like Jonathan Forte and Lloyd Sam it would cushion the blow considerably.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>I think the majority are slowly coming round to this squad having been initially unconvinced by the players KC has drafted in \u2013 in that respect it mirrors the reaction Martin Allen received at the end of last summer. That said, there are still a few who will be grateful if we can avoid a relegation battle \u2013 but that would've been no different if we'd have brought in Lionel Messi.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>I'm a bit confident actually. Our end of season form last year, coupled with us having got rid of some right dross whilst reinforcing quite nicely means it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest to see us pushing for the play-offs again. Certainly I think we're maybe one or two big signings away from turning that into a legitimate automatic promotion charge.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>A year on from his move up from the youth team, Haydn Hollis could easily become a star for Notts this season in the heart of defence.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>Notts being Notts, we're as liable to finishing one place outside the play-offs as we are outside the relegation zone. But I'll slot us into fifth place with a shout of making it to Wembley.</p> <p><strong>Stuart Brothers, </strong><a href=\"http://www.thenottsblog.co.uk\" title=\"\"><strong>The Notts Blog</strong></a> (<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/StuTNB\" title=\"\">@StuTNB</a>)</p> <h2>Oldham Athletic </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Gone: the main ones are Shefki Kuqi (no one's weeping); Chris Taylor (had some great years but right time to go) Kieran Lee (player of year for last two years). Incoming: Robbie Simpson has re-signed. Lee Croft is in on a year-long loan (welcome back); Jonathan Grounds from Boro (seems well regarded), Dan Taylor, coltish striker from Newcastle; Connor Brown from Sheffield United. We've just snapped up veteran ex-Scunny stopper (ie big lump) Cliff Byrne. Feeling is we need a striker as a priority.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>The fans want something other than what seems to happen every year \u2013 a promising build-up from September to December, then a spirit-sapping, numbing lurch down the table from January onwards and a finish between 15th and 20th. Optimists can say with James Wesolowski and Dean Furman together in central midfield and Simpson in front of them, we've never lost a game.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>The pessimist's response to that is that all the above are to a greater or lesser extent injury prone, and that they've only played eight games together. Gates will remain low, so unless we're very lucky with injuries (or land the near-mythical Big Money if Micah Richards moves) it's probably going to be the usual diet of young loanees and stopgap signings.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>David Mellor (save your Chelsea shirt gag, OK?) attracts the scouts, but no one seems to know his best position yet. Centre half James Tarkowski could have his breakthrough season - he'll certainly get enough opportunities.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> The law of averages says 16th. I've got no idea. Spirits are high after friendly win over Man City though<em>.</em></p> <p><strong>Neil Tague, Oldham fan </strong>(<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/NeilTague\" title=\"\">@NeilTague</a>)</p> <h2>Portsmouth</h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>The fact that we've spent all summer trying to get rid of our entire squad says it all. We've got a team of children and trialists we can't sign, plus a millionaire clinging onto his contract and risking our liquidation. We've been thrashed in pre-season friendlies by Gibraltar and Brighton, but somehow beating Aldershot and then a strong Bolton side has given us a sliver of hope. I'll still be stunned if we manage to put out a team \u2013 let alone a competitive one.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>A takeover by the Portsmouth Supporters' Trust. We're not asking for promotion, we're not</p> <p>demanding signings, we're desperate for mere survival and some semblance of stability.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>At worst, a takeover by Balram Chainrai and the slow death of the club. At best, immediate liquidation as Tal Ben Haim plays hardball over the remainder of his contract.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>It depends hugely on whether we can sign trialists like Izale McLeod or Mustapha Dumbuya. Of the current crop, Sam Magri has captained England under-17s and Portsmouth in pre-season. A centre-back who trialed with Liverpool last season, he could be key to any revival we experience, hopefully we can rebuild around him as he gets the chance to play regularly.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> the season if we're lucky.</p> <p><strong>Benedict West, Portsmouth fan</strong></p> <h2>Preston North End </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Where to start? Thirteen players signed by the end of May, almost all of last year's squad released, sold or training on their own, <em>another </em>text messaging furore \u2013 it's certainly been interesting. What we're left with is a squad of almost entirely new players that all fit into Graham Westley's game plan. There's been some encouraging signs in pre-season, particularly from the likes of John Mousinho, Jack King and Jeffrrey Monakana, but the signing of a striker between now and the start of the season is what will really make the difference.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>A committed team playing attractive, attacking football for a manager who lives up to his own hype. Anything better than the poorly-organised, disinterested teams we saw playing under various managers last season. Oh, and butter pies in all corners of the ground.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>A committed team playing committed football, short on goals but difficult to beat \u2013 and, importantly, on a sustainable wage bill. A manager with soundbites straight out of the David Brent phrasebook, but who convinces players to run through walls for him.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>North End fans weren't getting too excited about the signing of 26 year-old Jack King from Woking earlier in the summer, but he's been one of the most impressive performers in pre-season and looks set to be a key part of our midfield this season.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>It could go one of two ways \u2013 Westley's ways will work and we'll be challenging at the top, or it could blow up in his face and we'll be mid-table with Westley turfed out around Christmas. Definitely glass half full or half empty for North End fans at the moment.</p> <p><strong>Aaron Lavery, </strong><a href=\"http://www.pne-online.net/forum/forum.php\" title=\"\"><strong>PNE Online User</strong></a></p> <h2>Scunthorpe United </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>A massive squad overhaul has taken place over the close season, with the number of departures in double figures, fan favourite Cliff Byrne (now signed for Oldham) the most notable to leave the club after nine years loyal service. Players brought in have complemented what was left of a squad that struggled for periods of last season after relegation from the Championship. The biggest signings have been those of Mike Grella, Christian Ribeiro and David Mirfin. With the recent goal scoring exploits of the likes of Gary Hooper, Billy Sharp and Paul Hayes much will be expected of Grella, though a proven natural goalscorer is the one thing that seems missing from a slowly building squad.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Having tasted Championship football after years in the basement division many fans would have expected an instant return to the second tier. Visiting the likes of Birmingham and Blackburn on cold Tuesday nights would be a welcome return.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>With the need to find a 20-goals-a-season man glaringly obvious, a team built on a solid defence could be what they'll get. Mirfin and Reid at the heart of that defence looked solid at the end of last year so if the team can build from the back I'm sure we could be reasonably successful.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Has to be young striker Connor Jennings. Signed from non-league Stalybridge Celtic in January his season was wrecked by injury. A pedigree of 51 goals in 123 appearances for them tells you he can score and I think when he scores his first for the club they'll flow for him and we could see the next big thing off the Glanford Park production line.</p> <p><strong>Where we'll finish </strong>My heart says at least play-offs at least but with so many new signings at the club I just hope they can gel quickly and see us finish higher than we did last year. I'll stick my neck out and say sixth.</p> <p><strong>Carl Gac, </strong><a href=\"http://ironinourblood.blogspot.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Iron In Our Blood</strong></a> (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/carlgac\" title=\"\">@carlgac</a>)</p> <h2>Sheffield United </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>This was always going to be a summer of transition following the disappointment of last season's playoffs. With a reportedly unsustainable wage bill, pre-season has seen us try to balance the finances a bit. Lee Williamson, Matt Lowton, Andy Taylor and Simon Simonsen have all departed, their last actions of note unfortunately being to miss a penalty at Wembley.<strong> </strong>We're in reasonable shape though. Our best piece of business has certainly been to convince Kevin McDonald to renew his contract \u2013 this was unexpected and a huge boost. The pick of the new signings are Middlesbrough right-back Tony McMahon and striker John Cofie, loaned from Manchester United for the season.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Automatic promotion. The play-offs, repeatedly billed as 'the best way to go up', have been one nightmare after another for us. We've been to four finals, all losses, with not even a goal to celebrate. Understandably then, you won't find a Unitedite that would be thrilled at the prospect of another one this season.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Another play-off final. We thought we'd experienced all the varieties of devastating disappointment in play-off finals, but to lose on the 11th penalty was something new. We've never lost a lead in a play-off final though (mainly due to never having one), so perhaps that will happen this time \u2013 probably in the last minute of injury time.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>This might be the year our quick young winger Callum McFadzean breaks into the team. We're a bit short of options out wide, so he'll have a great chance this season.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>third again, with fewer points and goals than last season.</p> <p><strong>Joseph Clift, </strong><a href=\"http://onefootinthegame.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>One Foot In The Game</strong></a> (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/1FITG\" title=\"\">@1FITG</a>)</p> <h2>Shrewsbury Town </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>The summer has been a time of significant rebuilding for Shrewsbury with the spine of the team departing, using last season's success to bag themselves contracts with clubs with bigger budgets. Captain Ian Sharps, vice-captain Shane Cansdell-Sheriff, midfielder Nicky Wroe and forward Jim Collins all opted to leave the Greenhous Meadow as have both senior goalkeepers. Reinforcements have arrived in all departments with the most eye-grabbing being Paul Parry from Preston North End and midfielders Asa Hall and Luke Summerfield from Oxford and Cheltenham respectively. Performances in pre-season fixtures have been encouraging and there is some quiet optimism flowing through the Salopian faithful.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>History provides Salop fans with a mild basis for their hopes. The dream is that Graham Turner will continue to mirror what he achieved in the 1980s with Wolves: a first season missing out in play-offs before successive promotions. Another good showing in the cups would be nice too.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Avoiding relegation would be acceptable to supporters more realistic with their ambitions. Given Turner's ability in the loan market, should the Shrews find themselves near the drop, a push into mid-table would be well within their reach. A mid-table finish is certainly within the realms of reality.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>It's an area of the club that probably needs more work and the best of the current crop, Ryan Woods, might have too many established faces ahead of him to make a real impact.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>14th or a place either side.</p> <p><strong>Andrew Harding</strong>, Shrewsbury fan (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/andrewcharding\">@andrewcharding</a>) and proprietor of <a href=\"http://www.polkadotfootball.com/\">polkadot.football.com</a></p> <h2>Stevenage </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>After the departure of Graham Westley, it was inevitable the summer would lead to personnel changes. There is now little remaining of the squad responsible for Boro's ascent from the Conference into League One, with Gary Smith using the close season as a chance to shape a new team for a new era. The first few months of Smith's tenure saw Boro' move towards a more passing-focussed style of play and that looks destined to continue, with new arrivals such as Greg Tansey and James Dunne looking very capable. However, we'll learn a lot more about what the season has in store once it gets started.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Not so much want, but hope. Since 1990, it has been the case that Boro' either gain promotion or win the league within two seasons of a previous promotion. It could, therefore, be argued that Boro' will be a Championship club in 2013. Going close in the play-offs last season strengthens that case.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>For the first time in three years, we start the season in the same division we ended the last and some might argue that the dreaded second season syndrome might kick in. With a new style of play and new signings aplenty, mid-table will be a terrific achievement.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Luke Freeman will be the player to watch. With an ability to unlock defences in a shift of the ball, Boro' will look towards Freeman for plenty more goals and assists this season.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish </strong>In the likelihood that \"I don't know\" won't be accepted as an answer, we'll end up between 10th and 14th and nearer \u2013 in terms of points \u2013 to the play-offs than the relegation zone.</p> <p><strong>Pete Hayman, </strong><a href=\"http://www.boroguide.co.uk/index.php\" title=\"\"><strong>Boro Guide</strong></a><strong> </strong>(<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/boroguide\" title=\"\">@boroguide</a>)</p> <h2>Swindon Town </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>As manager and chairman alike push for the Championship, sentiment has gone out the window, as last season's top scorer, Alan Connell, is one of many to leave. To make up for this, Paolo Di Canio has brought in seven to serve the club going forward. The memory of dodgy, foreign imports is still fresh from last year, and unsurprisingly, all signings have experience of the Football League, with Gary Roberts, from Huddersfield, a particular coup. However, the most important bits of business done was securing both manager and captain Paul Caddis on long-term deals.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Having watched Stevenage, Norwich and Southampton all complete successive promotions in recent years, there is genuine optimism that Swindon can join the club. Much will depend on how quickly the new signings settle into the team.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>While promotion isn't beyond the realms of possibility, after finishing rock-bottom of League One two seasons ago, a top-half finish would be satisfactory.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Miles Storey \u2013 currently fourth choice striker, so will be relying on injuries and suspensions, but at 18, he has pace and strength and just needs his first goal to give him confidence.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish </strong>Play-offs after a late run of form.</p> <p><strong>Rosie MacGillivray </strong><a href=\"http://thewashbag.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>thewashbag</strong></a></p> <h2>Tranmere Rovers </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>There have been a few comings and goings this summer. Of the outgoing players, John Welsh and David Buchanan have left to join Preston and Lucas Akins has gone to Stevenage. They were all first team regulars but I think we've replaced them well. The star signing for Tranmere is undoubtedly James Wallace from Everton. He's a very talented midfielder who impressed during a loan spell with the club last season and his signing is a show of intent that we're looking to kick on this time around. There's also been a rather bizarre situation at Tranmere this summer. Striker Ben Burgess joined before four weeks later announcing his retirement! He's had a fair share of injuries and it appears that all that has caught up with him, so he's a contender with Mark Allott for shortest-lived new signing.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>After three seasons of fighting against relegation, a season without worry would be nice. We ended last season strongly and finished in the top half, just, in 12th. Every season, you should look for improvement and a battle for a play-off position would be fantastic.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Ronnie Moore is a very experienced manager and very rarely has he managed a side to a lowly position. With the strong finish after his appointment at the end of last season, together with the good signings he has made, I believe we'll be comfortable in the top half of the table for much of the campaign.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Jake Kirby made his debut in the final game of last season to give a small glimpse of his potential. The tricky winger is highly-regarded by Moore and if he is given an opportunity, he's a talented player who could make an impact this season.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>ninth</p> <p><strong>Paul Harper, </strong><a href=\"http://totally-tranmere.podomatic.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Totally Tranmere Podcast</strong></a><strong> </strong>(<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/paulharper82\" title=\"\">@paulharper82</a>)</p> <h2>Walsall </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>The summer has seen major change at the Banks's Stadium. More than 15 players have been shipped out in favour of a blend of youth and experience. Out went defenders Olly Lancashire, Lee Beevers, Darryl Westlake, Manny Smith and last seasons players' player of the season Mat Sadler, along with midfielders Kevan Hurst, Anton Peterlin, Alex Nicholls and fans' favourite Emmy Ledesma, and veteran striker Jon Macken. In, so far, we have, ex-Rochdale defender Dean Holden, ex-Wolves prospect Ashley Hemmings, last season's loan star Florent Cuvelier, former West Bromwich Albion defender Paul Downing, ex-Doncaster Rovers midfielder James Baxendale, former Hereford United defender Ben Purkiss, midfielder Nicky Featherstone and former Manchester United reserves striker Febian Brandy. Clearly there is still much rebuilding to do, but the steps taken so far are relatively positive, though we are lacking in experience, a situation that must be addressed.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Put simply the supporters want a play-off push. The Saddlers faithful are hungry for success after two long seasons of battling relegation.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>In reality, we'd all be very happy with mid-table mediocrity, anything that doesn't involve a final day miracle would be a nice building block for the future.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Last season's breakout star was without a doubt Jamie Paterson. This season we believe striker George Bowerman is in line for a massive campaign. Used in the correct way and given the right support he will play a major part in the coming season.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>After two seasons of relegation battles, we'd be happy with a mid-table finish. However following a major squad clearout there is little experience in the team and we may struggle come the business end of the season.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bescotbanter.net/\" title=\"\"><strong>Bescot Banter</strong></a> (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/bescotbanter\" title=\"\">@BescotBanter</a>)</p> <h2>Yeovil Town </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Last season's star performers have been picked up by bigger-spending clubs, giving Yeovil fans everywhere a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Defender Paul Huntington (Preston) and striker Andy Williams (Swindon) are the most notable players in question, and will be missed.<strong> </strong>However all is not lost. Manager Gary Johnson has plumped for a bit of experience in his signings, snaring 30-somethings Jamie McAllister and James Hayter, while retaining Richard Hinds and Gavin Williams to give the Glovers the air of maturity they have been crying out for going into recent seasons. Signing goalkeeper Marek Stech from West Ham further underlines a welcome change in club transfer policy. For the first time since 2008 we have a genuine No1 on the books, and will not have to rely on loan signings to stand between the sticks.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>A top-10 finish including a brief dabble with the play-offs places, a return to the days of the eye-catching cup run and for Luke Ayling to score a goal.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Another mid-table finish, an FA Cup first round defeat to Weymouth and the sight of several optimistic-but-wayward shots from the aforementioned Ayling.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>I'm personally looking forward to seeing how Sam Foley adapts to life in League One. Signed from Conference side Newport County, the 25-year-old attacking midfielder is yet to make his League debut, but from what I have heard the Irishman is more than capable of making the step up.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>13th with 57 points, a goal difference of -18 and average home attendance of 4,251</p> <p><strong>Jon Lewis, Yeovil fan (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/JonLewis_\" title=\"\"><strong>@JonLewis_</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>",
  "<p>Maybe we're wrong about the future of games. While those of us in the traditional industry wonder whether it's all going to be about next-gen consoles or smartphones or tablets, maybe it's going to be none of them \u2013 or more accurately, perhaps it will be all of them together. </p> <p>'Transmedia' is not a new phrase. The idea of combining linear content such as TV or web movies, with interactive elements delivered on phones and across the internet has been around for over a decade. In 2001, EA released its agenda-setting alternate reality game (ARG) Majestic, which used emails and even phone calls to draw players into a multiplatform conspiracy game. At the same time, TV and movie producers started to see the possibilities of using ARGs to market and build communities around key franchises \u2013 hence The Beast, a web game based around the film AI and The Lost Experience, which added depth and (even <em>more</em>) ambiguity to JJ Abrams' Lost series.</p> <p>Things have been relatively quiet recently, with many media giants preferring more conventional communication streams like Twitter and Facebook. However, launching this autumn could be one of the most ambitious transmedia concepts since Heroes creator Tim Kring launched his<a href=\"http://www.conspiracyforgood.com/\"> Conspiracy for Good</a> two years ago.</p> <p>Developed by French studio, <a href=\"http://www.lexis-games.com\">Lexis Num\u00e9rique</a>, Alt-Minds is a conspiracy thriller about the abduction of several young scientists. When the government shows little interest in their retrieval, their agency decides to investigate itself. The main narrative will be told via ten weekly 'webisodes', but players will also be able to subscribe to a newsfeed on their PC or tablet, providing background information and updates.</p> <p>\"But you can go much further,\" says spokesperson, Djamil Kemal. \"The Agency needs your help. To make it smooth, they distribute an app, available both on you PC and your tablet, that lets you take part in the investigation. You can receive the video logs and documents of the field investigators and help them progress. For instance, you can use the Agency's tools to analyse a picture, enhance a video and zoom in it to find a clue and much more.\"</p> <p>From here, wannabe detectives will be able to scour the web for clues, using Facebook, Google Earth and the websites of fictitious organisations as research tools \u2013 all the while earning XP. \"You can even receive emails from some of the characters,\" says Kemal. \"And if you agree, you can even be contacted by SMS. You find a character's phone number? Try to call him and see if he answers. Those who are really hooked will even be able to look for clues in the real world via smartphone-based geolocalized missions.\"</p> <p>Lexis Num\u00e9rique has worked on similar projects before. In 2003, the studio's co-founder, Eric Viennot, oversaw <a href=\"http://www.inmemoriam-thegame.com/\">In Memorian </a>one of the first commercially released titles to use ARG elements. Published by Ubisoft, it used all the familiar elements, SMS messages and clues buried in web pages, but married these to a conventional adventure game, reviewing very well at the time.</p> <p>For Alt-Minds, the complexity has been ramped up, with more advanced telecommunications elements and accessibility via multiple platforms. The developer has also teamed up with Orange as a tech partner. And it does sound like a major creative and technological nightmare. \"Coping with the creative challenges involves a very complex organisation,\" says Kemal. \"Much more than a script writer or a game designer, Eric Viennot is a narrative architect. He worked with a team of game designers, level designers, community managers, social game designers, script writers, 2D artists, web designers, programmers, video artists, photographs and much more\u2026</p> <p>\"On a technical standpoint, the whole project is a huge challenge. You have to manage tons of data and synchronise it; deal with more than 15 hours of videos, develop apps that can be played on many devices, not only the latest ones; integrate the newest Facebook functionalities \u2013 thanks to Facebook's direct support. All that in a limited amount of time.\"</p> <p>Until now, ARGs have been rather a minority interest, fascinating to web natives and interactive fiction fans, but hardly mainstream. Kemal, however, sees things changing as attitudes to screened entertainment evolve. \"TV is not the dominant screen any more,\" he says. \"You now watch a series or play games on many screens. Multitasking is becoming a norm \u2013 who hasn't surfed on the internet or played a game while watching a TV series? Also, gamification is everywhere now. Games are part of our lives. 55% of Facebook users play games. The way we use media has changed drastically and the content \u2013 TV, movies, games \u2013 has to evolve and take in this new situation\". </p> <p>Alt-Minds is referred to on its website as the first \"total fiction\", and many do think this is the way entertainment is heading \u2013 a converged, pervasive experience taking in linear narratives, games, and even real-life interactive elements. We're already seeing the explosion of urban games and location-based adventures like the fascinating Zombie chase game <a href=\"http://2.8hourslater.com/\">2.8 Hours Later</a>. Is it possible that the future will contain games that can be subsumed into everyday life? The big question is how far mainstream audiences are prepared to immerse themselves.</p> <p>\"To what extent are you ready to accept pervasiveness?\" asks Kemal. \"This is closely linked to the respect for privacy. You may not be ready to receive emails or text messages at your office, or to be followed by a weird guy in a dark street, wondering if it's part of the plot or not.</p> <p>\"Please note, this WON'T happen in Alt-Minds. If a weird guy follows you in a dark street, run!\"</p> <p><em>Alt-Minds is launching this autumn.

  "<p>As part of the investment in security surrounding the Olympics in London, the Health Protection Agency has been touting a state-of-the-art disease surveillance system promising real-time collection and analysis of health-related data to detect threats as early as possible. It tracks flu symptoms, rashes, vomiting, double vision, and other symptoms of infectious diseases.</p> <p>The effort is laudable, and it makes good sense for an event as big as the Games.</p> <p>But, when the Olympics are over, a more powerful and effective way of protecting the public from imminent health threats would be to apply that same innovative spirit and computational power to preventable chronic diseases and their associated risk factors. Heart disease, cholesterol, high blood pressure and obesity kill more people every day than infectious diseases.</p> <p>This is partly a political reality. If five children die from meningitis during the London Olympics, the government would be attacked by the media, and officials would lose their jobs. Unfortunately, the roughly 250 heart attacks that will occur every day in England during the Olympics will cause no alarm at all.</p> <p>In the US, a third of the 2.4m deaths annually are due to just two causes: heart disease and stroke. Yet there is no outcry. But after a handful of cases of whooping cough nationwide, agencies coast to coast mobilised against it. But this is changing.</p> <p>More than a century ago, New York had this same infectious-disease mindset, but when cholera threatened to kill and maim in 1866, inspectors from the newly created metropolitan health department went door to door collecting people's clothes and burning them. They disinfected bathrooms, kitchens, and bedrooms. It worked; fatalities from cholera dropped 90% from the previous epidemic in 1849.</p> <p>New York now leads the way in public health in fighting chronic diseases, with smoking bans, cooking oil restrictions, calorie counts on menus, and restrictions on the amount of soda that can be sold. We can debate the relative effectiveness of different policies, but the overall campaign is a winner: engage the community in a discussion of the importance of healthy behaviours, put policies in place that encourage those behaviours, and measure the impact of those policies.</p> <p>And look what has happened to life expectancy: the average for men increased by 13.6 years between 1989 and 2009, the biggest improvement in the country. For women, the gain was 7.2 years, also the best. A big part of these gains is due to the successful control of infectious diseases, and especially HIV/Aids. But the public health approach to chronic disease is an important component that should be a model for other agencies worldwide.</p> <h2><strong>This requires three steps</strong></h2> <p>\u2022 Build consensus before going bold. If a city had tried to ban supersized sodas two decades ago, protesters would have flooded the streets with signs saying: \"No taxation without carbonation!\" New York leaders prepared their audience by showing them the damage being done by runaway calorie consumption.</p> <p>\u2022 Prove the concept. Cities and states followed New York's lead in requiring calorie counts on menus. Studies have subsequently shown that when people read the calorie information, they generally choose lower-calorie items.</p> <p>\u2022 Utilise your assets. One of the most exciting things about the infectious disease surveillance program launched in the UK is its use of aggregated data from physician visits by millions of patients. This is a big institutional and cultural leap from just a decade ago when governments were slow to detect and respond to Sars.</p> <p>To track chronic diseases, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington is piloting a project working with the Seattle and King County health department that merges data sources from hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies. The main objective is to determine the causes of disparities in outcomes and to better develop programmes to control chronic diseases. We hope other cities, states, and countries follow suit to find the health disparities in their communities and address them.</p> <p>Chronic diseases deserve the same attention as infectious diseases. Both are equally important and should be approached with the same vigour and high-tech innovation.</p> <p><em>Ali Mokdad is professor of global health at the</em><a href=\"http://www.healthmetricsandevaluation.org/about-ihme\" title=\"\"><em> Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation</em></a><em> (IHME) at the University of Washington and leads the survey and surveillance activities at the Institute</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/healthcare/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",

  "<p>Africa once was an important exporter of raw peanuts. In the 1960s, the continent accounted for about 75% of the global trade; by 2005, that had figure had slumped to just 5%. Increased competition from America, Argentina and particularly China was part of the story. But <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/chemicalsafety/contaminants/aflatoxins_en.htm\" title=\"\">stricter food safety controls from Europe</a> also took their toll. In particular, European countries placed strict limits on the level of <a href=\"http://www.icrisat.org/aflatoxin/food_security.asp\" title=\"\">aflatoxins</a> \u2013 a type of mycotoxin fungi \u2013 in peanuts, hitting countries such as Malawi.</p> <p>Aflatoxins are a naturally occurring but highly toxic substance caused by fungi that grow on crops such as maize, paprika and peanuts (more commonly referred to as groundnuts in Africa). Contaminations can happen as a result of poor pre- and post-harvest practices, such as inadequate drying and storage. Poor-quality kernels \u2013 immature, shrivelled or damaged \u2013 are prone to contamination by aflatoxins.</p> <p>There have been several reported cases of acute aflatoxicosis \u2013 where extremely high doses of aflatoxin have been ingested \u2013 associated with the consumption of contaminated homegrown maize. There were two outbreaks in Kenya \u2013 one in 1982, in which 12 people died, and one in 2004, in which 317 people became ill and 125 people died.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/intropp/topics/Mycotoxins/Pages/EconomicImpact.aspx\" title=\"\">The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that 25% of the world's crops</a> are affected by mycotoxins, leading to chronic exposure for about 4.5 billion people, mainly in the tropics and subtropics.</p> <p>The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organisation estimate that approximately 80% of liver cancers \u2013 which are far more prevalent in the tropical and sub-tropical parts of the developing world \u2013 are related to aflatoxin consumption. Aflatoxins are also linked to increased susceptibility to maternal anaemia and childhood stunting. In west Africa, stunted or underweight children have aflatoxin levels that are 30% to 40% higher than in children of normal height and weight.</p> <p>Studies conducted by the <a href=\"http://www.icrisat.org/\" title=\"\">International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics</a> (Icrisat) in southern India revealed aflatoxin levels as high as 40 times the permissible limit. Both groundnut haulms (crop residue) and cake made from crushed seeds are major sources of animal feed. This can lead to the contamination of milk in both urban and rural areas, potentially exposing a huge cross-section of the population, particularly children, to the effects of aflatoxins.</p> <p>Yet food safety, according to <a href=\"http://www.twin.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Twin</a>, a fair trade NGO, is neglected and should be firmly on the development agenda, particularly at a time when David Cameron is co-chairing the UN committee that will look at the post-2015 development agenda and leading the 2013 G8 meetings that will address food security and nutrition. The UK prime minister is also chairing the hunger summit on Sunday, making the most of the presence of world leaders at the Olympics closing ceremony.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.twin.org.uk/projects/afri-nut-ltd-landmark-groundnut-processing-plant-malawi\" title=\"\">Twin is currently working on food safety and food security in Malawi, focusing on groundnuts</a>, but with wider implications for key staple crops such as maize. Malawi once had significant groundnut exports (up to 40,000 metric tonnes a year), but volumes have now dropped severely following the implementation of rigorous food safety standards in Europe. Twin's work in Malawi initially focused on improving the safety of groundnuts for the international market. As it learned more about aflatoxin contamination, however, its focus switched to making food safe for the domestic population.</p> <p>\"Concentrating on food security and nutrition are not enough,\" said Andrew Emmott, senior nut manager at Twin. \"Nutrition is seen as a silver bullet, but, unless you look at the full range of issues including food safety, you've got a problem. Keeping contaminated food from being exported to Europe does not mean that you are keeping unsafe food out of the local population in Malawi.\"</p> <p>Twin says 60% of groundnuts grown in Malawi are traded informally and consumed locally, and are not subject to any testing for aflatoxin. The same applies to trading and consumption of staples such as maize. Techniques for preventing contamination can be relatively simple. Groundnuts that are allowed to dry well immediately after harvesting tend to develop negligible levels of contamination, whereas groundnuts left out but covered with haulms and leaves tend to develop high levels of aflatoxin contamination. The most effective means of control is immediate removal of pods from harvested plants, but this is not always possible at a time when other farm activities are at their peak, so one possible option is the use of cheap dryers.</p> <p>Donors have not entirely neglected aflatoxins. The <a href=\"http://www.merid.org/aflatoxinpartnership/Press_Release.aspx\" title=\"\">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the UK's Department for International Development announced funding of $19.8m and $1.6m, respectively, in February</a> to support the Partnership for aflatoxin control in Africa to look at solutions such as proper drying and storage.</p>",

  "<p>Four Chinese police officers have gone on trial charged with covering up the murder of the British businessman Neil Heywood by Gu Kailai, as fresh details emerged of the case against her.</p> <p>The men are accused of \"bending the law to show favouritism\" to shield the wife of Bo Xilai, who was then the powerful party secretary of the south-western city where they worked, Chongqing.</p> <p>Like Gu they are standing trial in Hefei, around 650 miles east of Bo's former power base, under heavy security. Foreign media were again excluded from the large courtroom on the grounds that there were not enough seats.</p> <p>Officials have said that Gu, 53, and family aide Zhang Xiaojun, 33, did not dispute the allegation of premeditated murder at their trial on Thursday. A verdict will be delivered at an unspecified date.</p> <p>Scant details were included in the statement released to the media. But accounts that emerged from those who had been in the courtroom put some flesh on the official explanation that Gu killed her former friend in the belief he was a threat to her only child, Bo Guagua.</p> <p>They suggested Heywood was angered when a property deal to which Bo Guagua introduced him went wrong, and wanted money from the young man over the \u00a3130m transaction. According to the Chinese translation of an English email shown in court, purportedly sent by the Briton, Heywood said: \"You will be destroyed.\"</p> <p>In an email to Reuters, Bo Guagua wrote: \"I cannot comment on any of the details [of the letter], but I can disclose that there is no such thing as either possessing or transferring 130 million pounds.\"</p> <p>The Washington Post's source said <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/gu-kailai-wife-of-bo-xilai-does-not-contest-murder-charge-at-closed-trial-in-china/2012/08/09/24153ebc-e206-11e1-ae7f-d2a13e249eb2\\_story\\_1.html\" title=\"\">the court was told that Gu confessed to her husband's ally and police chief Wang Lijun</a> on the day after the murder \u2013 not realising he was secretly recording the conversation. Another version of events, <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/asie-pacifique/article/2012/08/09/les-revelations-du-proces-de-gu-kailai_1744271_3216.html\" title=\"\">from Le Monde</a>, said Wang was aware of the plan before the murder even happened.</p> <p>The Post's source also said defence lawyers suggested that Heywood could have died from a heart attack or that someone else was involved.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/portal/site/SCMP/menuitem.2af62ecb329d3d7733492d9253a0a0a0/?vgnextoid=13b51219f3cf8310VgnVCM100000360a0a0aRCRD&amp;ss=china&amp;s=news\" title=\"\">South China Morning Post reported on Friday</a> that Wang could stand trial as early as next week. His break with Bo and flight to the US consulate in Chengdu, where he claimed that Gu had killed Heywood, triggered the scandal that led to the politician's downfall.</p> <p>Dealing with Gu and Wang would clear the way to resolving Bo's own case ahead of the transition of power to a new generation of leaders this autumn. It remains unclear whether he will face criminal charges. He has not been seen since his fall from power in March and no comment has been made on his case since it emerged that he is under investigation by the party for alleged disciplinary violations.</p> <p>Chen Guangwu, a criminal defence attorney who has followed the Chongqing scandal closely, told Reuters: \"This case is in part about testing the waters for [dealing with Bo]. That is, they will sentence her and see what reaction there is in society and public opinion.\"</p> <p>The four officers on trial on Friday are Guo Weiguo, Li Yang, Wang Pengfei and Wang Zhi. All were senior police officers in Chongqing.</p> <p>According to previous media reports, Wang Pengfei spent years working for Wang Lijun in north-eastern China and was regarded as his closest aide. He transferred to Chongqing around the time his boss did.</p> <p>Guo Weiguo, another officer who had served in the north-east, was involved in Bo and Wang's high-profile \"strike black\" campaign against organised crime. Li Yang and Wang Pengfei were removed from their posts in June this year. Li took charge of the criminal investigations department at Chongqing last year.</p>",
  "<p>How the international community responds to human rights in times of conflict has always been an issue when judgments are made about differential levels of culpability for war crimes.</p> <p>In Iraq, a conflict I covered on the ground between 2003 and 2007, when the Shia death squads first began their campaign of murder there was a widespread resistance among US and UK officials to acknowledge that a problem existed. When they would acknowledge it, some \u2013 shamefully \u2013 chose to depict it as a natural consequence of the brutality of the Saddam era.</p> <p>And while it is true that periods of brutality can condition the time that follows, it is not something that should be tolerated.</p> <p>In Syria, a similar process is visibly occurring. It is not, as some have claimed, that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2012/mar/20/syria-opposition-accused-abuses-live\" title=\"\">human rights abuses by the Free Syrian Army are not being reported</a> \u2013 they are including by this paper's correspondents in the field \u2013 it is that in a wider political context, those atrocities have not attracted the same levels of opprobrium as those committed by Bashar al-Assad's regime.</p> <p>To state the obvious first: the fact is that the Assad regime abuses have been on a far, far wider scale and conducted over a longer period of time. Regime forces have murdered unarmed demonstrators and tortured minors.</p> <p>The regime has used both indirect and direct fire indiscriminately on civilian centres, amounting to serious war crimes, and has conducted a long-running campaign to terrorise those areas opposed to the regime.</p> <p>When atrocities attributed to regime forces or militias have emerged they have rightly been condemned by our political leaders and representatives.</p> <p>But sadly it has also been the case when the Free Syrian Army or its allies, some of them jihadi groups, have committed war crimes and serious human rights abuses, the condemnation has been far less vocal or has sought to mitigate the acts by characterising them as somehow an inevitable by-product of the ugliness of war or somehow the responsibility of the Assad regime itself by being the first to abuse.</p> <p>The reality, as organisations including both Amnesty and Human Rights Watch have made clear, is that there is no excusing war crimes, whomever commits them.</p> <p>As Kristyan Benedict noted in a powerful blog posting for Amnesty UK after the <a href=\"http://www2.amnesty.org.uk/blogs/campaigns/justifying-abuse-kills-hope-human-rights-revolution-syria\" title=\"\">murder of bound captives from the notorious Berri clan by FSA fighters in Aleppo</a> at the beginning of this month, to cheer that murder while claiming to want a new Syria where human rights are respected \"is a gross hypocrisy\".</p> <p>\"It is not,\" Benedict continued, \"about equivalence or saying the scale of abuses is anywhere near the violations by government forces \u2013 it is about taking a consistent approach whenever abuses and violations occur and by whomever. The armed opposition do not get a free pass because their opponent is terrorising, punishing and humiliating civilians across Syria.\"</p> <p>The murders of the Berri clan members has not been an isolated incident. As an Amnesty statement made clear only days before that event, a growing number of abuses by the FSA had been visible in the weeks before, including \"deliberate and unlawful killings\" as well as the \"torture of captured security force members\".</p> <p>Nor is there evidence that there has been an active effort by local commanders to intervene to prevent abuses. Indeed, in recent days, fresh evidence has emerged of groups breaching international humanitarian law, including the <a href=\"http://www.rt.com/news/syrian-host-saeed-executed-868/\" title=\"\">kidnap and execution of a journalist with Syrian state television</a>.</p> <p>It is true to say that these issues have been debated more thoroughly among members of the Syrian opposition, some of whom are appalled by what they have seen, rather than among some of those western countries have given both political and practical support to Syria's armed opposition, including the US who \u2013 it has been persistently reported \u2013 has been escalating its assistance.</p> <p>Both the US state department and Britain's Foreign Office \u2013 which recently announced increased support for the rebels \u2013 need to be unequivocal in their condemnation of all abuses that are committed and not just those which are the responsibility of the regime, including warning the FSA that there are concrete consequences contingent on both abuses and also the failure of local leaders to act when abuses are committed.</p> <p>It should be made explicitly clear that murder, kidnapping and torture by the opposition will not only endanger the support that they are currently receiving but that individuals responsible will be pursued and prosecuted for their crimes. Because if humanitarian law is to have any real meaning, it must be applied both thoroughly and evenhandedly \u2013 not only to regimes the west disapproves of.</p>",

  "<p>Last year, the people of Wales <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cardiff/2011/mar/04/welsh-assembly-referendum-counting-begins\" title=\"\">voted for the National Assembly for Wales to have primary law-making powers</a>. Today, in 20 fields such as health, education, local government and the environment, the national assembly has the authority to legislate without Westminster. The executive itself is now separate from the assembly and shortly after the referendum rebranded itself the Welsh government. So today, I am calling on the National Assembly for Wales to be renamed the Welsh parliament.</p> <p>In this, the week of the <a href=\"http://www.eisteddfod.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Eisteddfod</a>, the most important Welsh cultural event in the calendar, I feel it is now time to have a Welsh parliament. Polling and the recent referendum show that the electorate want an institution as strong as a parliament, and in reality the national assembly is in all but name the Welsh parliament.</p> <p>Many may question why I as a proud unionist would call for such a move. I have never shied away from the fact that I believe the United Kingdom has been a force for good, where we have a richer and fairer society because we are united. Where the UK allows us a much bigger presence on the world stage, where as we have seen with the Olympics, the UK has so much to offer the world as a union. But, by the same measure, I and many in the Welsh Conservatives are proud to be Welsh. We are proud of our culture, language and heritage, and as a party are proud of devolution.</p> <p>There can be no doubt too, that uncertainty with the Scottish referendum is having repercussions in Wales. Some in Wales do want to break away and go it alone. A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/01/wales-drumbeat-devolution\" title=\"\">recent poll</a>, however, showed that only 7% of people in Wales do want to separate. I believe that the United Kingdom gives us strength as a community. When any part of the United Kingdom suffers a setback, the rest of the country stands behind it. From severe weather to economic setbacks, there is a community within our union that goes beyond the political to the emotional. It is because of strength of the UK that I believe now is the time to have a strong Welsh parliament in a strong United Kingdom.</p> <p>So why now? Why change a name from assembly to parliament?</p> <p>This isn't simply a rebrand for the sake of rebranding; this is a statement about the institution that now legislates for our great nation. The assembly deserves to be respected. It deserves the respect of the executive, and it deserves to be an institution that stands out. Some may question why there needs to be any change at all. There is a parliament in Scotland with primary law-making powers, so why not in Wales?</p> <p>For years, confusion has understandably existed among the Welsh public in distinguishing between the Welsh assembly government and the National Assembly for Wales. The rebranding of WAG to Welsh government' has helped mitigate that, but we believe the time has come for Wales's devolved institution to lose the \"assembly\" tag and brand itself as a proper Welsh parliament \u2013 strengthening the distinction between legislature and executive, while giving it the accolade the people of Wales afforded it in last year's referendum.</p> <p>The process for this to happen is very simple. One small amendment to the Government of Wales Act 2006 would be all that needs to happen to change the National Assembly for Wales into the Welsh parliament. No expensive rebrand, no new buildings, no more politicians, no new protocol, but what a statement it would be!</p> <p>A statement that shows that Wales is a nation with a strong legislature in a strong United Kingdom.</p> <p>When we look at other countries such as Australia, state parliaments operate alongside the national parliament. In the UK, we have the Scottish parliament and the Westminster parliament. There is no reason why we couldn't have the Welsh parliament, too.</p> <p>So in this week of celebration of Welsh culture, I call on other leaders to consider this change. There is no hurry to overnight changes, but in 2016 wouldn't it be a great thing for the Welsh people to vote in elections for a Welsh parliament for the first time since the 15th century.</p> <p>Some may say that this is just a name change, but I say that there is a lot in a name.</p>",
  "<p>First of all let's get the personal issues out of the way. I would already qualify for older persons' housing myself, and I have supported my father and mother-in-law through the difficult process of admission to care homes.</p> <p>The debate over the government's <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/07/careandsupportwhitepaper/\" title=\"\">social care white paper</a> has focused minds on the demographic time bomb and its costs. The expectation that elderly people will have to put aside up to \u00a3100,000 to pay for their care and support has divided opinion. As Michael Portillo put it, people see the equity in their homes as money for a rainy day; if you need care and support, it's already raining.</p> <p>So why is it that older people have been shielded from most of the impact of welfare reform? They will not suffer the bedroom tax \u2013 a reduction in benefits for under-occupation of social housing, yet they commonly underoccupy property in all sectors, overconsuming assets, putting pressure on rent and house prices and often living lonely and impoverished lives.</p> <p>Older people can opt to have their rent paid direct to their landlord, even though their financial affairs will often be much more stable than people of working age in low-paid employment. The benefit cap is unlikely to affect their ability to meet their housing costs; it impacts on larger families because their living costs are so much greater, leaving less money for rent.</p> <p>The only change that may adversely affect them is a reduction in benefits for non-dependent members of the household. This may have the perverse consequence that older tenants invite children of working age to move on, creating more underoccupancy and greater pressure on the housing market.</p> <p>The consequences of these policies are visible all around us. Where I live in north London the local almshouse charity is resorting to advertising for tenants for a lovely terrace of one bedroom homes on the church green. Meanwhile larger family homes house just one or two empty-nesters, and properties held by older tenants in the social sector are passed on to sons and daughters under the rights of succession, perpetuating welfare dependency.</p> <p>But wait, necessity (or austerity) is the mother of invention. When I acted as judge for a housing awards ceremony last year, there were four fantastic projects helping elderly underoccupiers to move to more appropriate homes.</p> <p>It isn't the money that causes older people to stay in homes that no longer suit them. What they need is a quality housing offer for the active elderly with intensive help and support during the process of moving. Living in smaller accommodation with access to support, life expectancy and happiness both rise.</p> <p><em>Mervyn Jones is director of housing consultancy at </em><a href=\"http://www.savills.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Savills</em></a><em> </em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for news, views and best practice direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>The first thing to say about Arabella Boxer's <em>Book of English Food</em> is that most of it seems to be in French.

While all are doubtless delicious, none sounds as though it was assembled from ingredients foraged at dawn from a Wiltshire hedgerow and assembled within blood-splattering distance of Smithfield.</p> <p>That's because Boxer is writing not about our current food revival \u2013 chitterlings washed down with a hyper-local beer followed by a nice Eccles cake and a slab of Stilton. Instead, her book concerns a brief and overlooked flowering of British (not just English, surely?) cuisine during the two decades that divided the two world wars.</p> <p>It was then, she contends, that Edwardian pomposity was shaken off at the table, thanks in part to the fact that no one could afford a full kitchen staff, let alone a phalanx of fine-calved footmen to hand round all those filigreed soup tureens. The keynote was simplicity, elegance, the art of doing more with less. And that, as far as influential taste-makers such as June Platt in Vogue or <a href=\"http://www.talkingoffood.com/listen/2-audio-content/12-kitchen-essays.html\" title=\"\">Agnes Jekyll</a> in her <em>Kitchen Essays</em> were concerned, meant keeping the <em>franglais</em> element of fine dining, but grafting on to it a new American pep, as typified by Wallis Simpson and her whip-thin compatriots. The final mix seemed just right for those lurchingly uncertain times: part country-house comfort, part C\u00f4te d'Azur chic, with a glaze of New York Modern.</p> <p>Boxer first published her homage to inter-war food in 1991, at a time when it was still possible to talk to people who remembered their first-hand encounters with \"<a href=\"http://www.cookitsimply.com/recipe-0010-01007m1.html\" title=\"\">Haddock Monte Carlo</a>\" or \"Corn Meal Souffl\u00e9\". Now, 20 years later, reissued with art deco-ish illustrations by Cressida Bell, it is hard to know quite how to read this book for our own time. In her new introduction, Boxer makes an interesting argument about why the cooking of the inter-war period so quickly fell victim to cultural amnesia. Two decades were not long enough, she suggests, for anyone outside a small elite to get the hang of this new way of eating (Boxer, who was born in 1934 to the Earl of Moray and his American wife, may be considered part of that favoured cohort).</p> <p>Then along came Hitler, followed by dreary food rationing, which meant that by the time a sun-drenched Elizabeth David hove into view, post-war Britain was primed to go mad for continental food. At a stroke, we forgot how rich and varied our own table had recently been, and we have been forgetting ever since. It is quite appalling, quivers Lady Arabella, sounding remarkably like Lady Bracknell, that pesto should now count as a British national dish.</p> <p>Perhaps the best and most enjoyable way to read this book is in the way that its republication was probably intended, as pleasurable, if disjointed, nostalgia. For who could not be charmed by an imagined world where any minute now you might be called to an encounter with Marcel Boulestin's Escalopes de Veau aux Concombres, followed by Lady Portarlington's Apple Tart? Fun, too, are the anecdotes that Boxer weaves into her text. Vegetables became <em>le dernier cri</em> during this period. Trust flashy Lady Cunard to up the ante by serving no fewer than six different varieties of green at one meal. Her fellow American Nancy Astor, on the other hand, preferred to rely on her own resources to show her guests a good time. Drink was strictly forbidden at Cliveden, but instead Lady Astor donned huge false teeth after dinner and waited for the chuckles that never came. Lady Jekyll, meanwhile, who was British but had a soft spot for all things American, was completely entranced with the new ready-made breakfast cereals coming from the other side of the Atlantic. She suggested serving bowls of Rice Krispies at cocktail parties as a chic alternative to salted almonds.</p> <p>Boxer serves up an odd anecdote about a \"recent\" \u2013 which must mean late-80s \u2013 shooting party she attended, at which cassoulet was served for lunch. It \"did not meet with approval from the other guests\", reports Lady Arabella, \"being considered too exotic\". This conjures up the oddest picture of head-scarved women turning nasty on the grouse moor when they realise that their hostess has messed up their favourite Lancashire hotpot.

  "<p>Manchester United have slashed the price of their shares ahead of their debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.</p> <p>The club had been set to sell their shares for between $16-$20 (\u00a310.20-\u00a312.80) a share but cut them to $14 late on Thursday following negative comments from Wall Street analysts and Facebook's disappointing stock market debut in May.</p> <p>Even after the cut United will be valued at $2.3bn (\u00a31.5bn) making them the most valuable football club in the world. Real Madrid, their closest rivals in financial terms, are valued at $1.88bn, according to an annual ranking by Forbes magazine.</p> <p>The shares are being sold by the Glazer family, a US-family who made their fortune with shopping malls and trailer parks and also own the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p> <p>The Glazers bought United in 2005 for about \u00a3800m. They are selling 16.7m shares, equal to a 10% stake, and will raise about $330m. The family will net about about \u00a390m from the flotation.</p> <p>The club claim a global fan base of about 660m and have won a record 19 league titles. Their share sale will be the largest sports listing on record, surpassing World Wrestling Federation's $190m IPO in 1999, according to Thomson Reuters.</p> <p>It will also be the most high-profile since Facebook's ill-fated debut on the Nasdaq stock exchange in May. The social network's much hyped share sale proved a bust and shares initially sold at $38 are now worth $20.</p> <p>Wall Street analysts have warned they believe United's sale too could be a disappointment. \"I'm calling this son of Facebook,\" said David Menlow, president of the research firm IPOfinancial.com.</p> <p>He said too little of the money being raised looked like it was going to be invested in the club, the club had too many debts and it was not clear how they intended to grow as a business.</p> <p>\"Sports franchises have this emotional flourish, then everybody wakes up and wonders, 'Do I really want to own this?'\" he said.</p> <p>Sam Hamadeh, founder New York-based analyst PrivCo, called United \"a collectible not an investment\". \"This is one for the rabid fan,\" he said.</p> <p>This is the Glazer family's third attempt at a share sale having previously scrapped efforts to sell shares on exchanges in Hong Kong and Singapore.</p> <p>Those sales failed as investors balked at United's proposed dual class share structure. Under the US listing the family will retain control of the club through class B shares that have 10 times more voting power than the publicly traded class A shares.</p> <p>The company is also taking advantage of recently introduced US laws that limit the financial disclosures it must make. United is raising capital as an \"emerging growth\" company under president Barack Obama's recently passed Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or Jobs Act.</p> <p>The move means United will not be required to file quarterly reports or be subject to the same level of financial scrutiny as other US-listed firms for five years.</p> <p>Some of the proceeds from the sale are expected to be used to pay down some of the 134-year-old club's debt, which was last reported to be around \u00a3423m. But the Glazer family had originally claimed all the proceeds would go towards United's debt, angering some fans.</p> <p>A leading fans group has called for a boycott of the club's sponsors in protest at the terms of the share sale.</p> <p>A statement from the Manchester United Supporters Trust (Must) read: \"The Manchester United Supporters Trust has today called for a worldwide boycott of Manchester United sponsors' products, with support across the UK, Europe, Asia and the US. The boycott strategy is intended to send a loud and clear message to the Glazer family and club sponsors that, without the support and purchasing power of the fans, the global strength of the Manchester United brand doesn't actually exist.\"</p>",
  "<p>Here's another side of the grouse moor issue, which was the subject of today's first <em>Guardian Northerner</em> post: environmental campaigners are holding a protest walk this Sunday, 12 August, before launching a national discussion on the management of blanket bogs.</p> <p>The issue comes close to home for many of those who will take part in the event at Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire, a town which has made regular national headlines this summer because of its <a href=\"http://www.hebdenbridge.co.uk/\">devastation by floods</a>.

This<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/mar/14/natural-england-peatland-bog-burning\"> (map on link) ended a planned public inquiry</a> and prosecution of the estate for 43 alleged breaches of environmental management of a Site of Special Scientific Interest. </p> <p>Natural England and moorland owners defend the agreement as a way of safeguarding bogs while allowing conservation of the heather which is essential for the birds to flourish. Natural England and the estate say that the stewardship:</p> <blockquote> <p>ends earlier, imprecise and unlimited consents in favour of an agreement that operates for a defined period of time - 25 years - and that specifies agreed limits on the scale of management activities and provides greater opportunity for habitat conservation and recovery. For the first time, burning activities will be subject to specific controls. </p> </blockquote> <p>The moor debate and the floods have prompted a decision to go further and set up a <a href=\"http://www.energyroyd.org.uk/archives/tag/ban-the-burn\">Ban the Burn campaign</a> nationally, which will be launched at Hebden Bridge Trades Club after the walk (which looks like being blessed by fair weather, according to forecasts). This intends to highlight four issues raised by schemes like the Walshaw Moor stewardship, which has exemptions to the Heather and Grass Burning Code incorporated allowing burning on the moors areas of blanket bog. Ban the Burn will emphasise:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>- increased flood risk downstream<br>- very significant carbon emissions<br>- adverse impacts on water quality<br>- the destruction of a globally significant habitat type</p> </blockquote> <p>Dongria Kondh, one of the walkers, says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Here in Hebden Bridge we know the real hardship of flooding \u2013 shops and businesses in our town are still shut, and many of our friends and neighbours have suffered irreplaceable loss.&#xa0; In order to reduce our town's vulnerability to flooding, we need the upland catchment to be managed to promote healthy blanket bog, with sphagnum moss to act as a sponge in heavy rainfall events.</p> <p>It seems grotesque that the taxpayer is paying for the exact opposite - \u00a32.5 million is about five times as much as is in the Calder Valley flood recovery fund. &#xa0;If Walshaw Moor wants public subsidies, it must use them for the public good and completely restore the blanket bogs on its estate.</p> </blockquote> <p>Blanket bogs have EU protection and 83 percent of the UK's are recovering, largely through stewardship arrangements such as that negotiated over Walshaw Moor. Eleven percent have reached a 'favourable condition.' Their relevance to flooding, in addition to their landscape and natural virtues, <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110320092856/http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/about_us/news/2008/300108.aspx\">was described </a>by Andrew Wood, Natural England's executive director for evidence and policy, to the House of Commons' environment, food and rural affairs select committee inquiry into flooding in January 2008:</p> <blockquote> <p>Investing more money in traditional flood defences by constructing concrete and earth embankments may no longer be adequate or sustainable in the long-term. We must look to more sustainable solutions including those involving land-use change.</p> <p>The capacity of the countryside to absorb water must be increased. To do this we must start by reversing changes made to landscapes. Restoration of peat bogs in northern uplands would slow water reaching the streams and lowland rivers, reducing the threat to towns such as Ripon, Hull and Sheffield \u2013 all of which have experienced severe flooding.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394497021\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2010/11/3/1288804434426/Male-Red-Grouse-in-Heathe-001.jpg\" alt=\"Male Red Grouse in Heather\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The quarry: a male red grouse in heather.

The agreement sets restrictions on the maintenance and creation of infrastructure (such as roads/ tracks, car parks and grouse butts) and there is also agreement relating to weed treatment, stocking densities and vehicle usage.

  "<p>It was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jul/20/sex-offenders-lie-detector-tests\">recently announced</a> that the government is keen to introduce mandatory polygraph testing for rapists and other serious sex offenders when they are released from prison, in the hope that this will reduce re-offending rates and thus protect the public. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/publications/research-and-analysis/moj-research/evaluation-of-mandatory-polygraph-pilot.pdf\">A pilot study</a> has been carried out in the East and West Midlands suggesting that the routine use of such testing would lead to offenders being more honest with their offender managers. Offenders undergoing polygraph testing made twice as many \"clinically significant disclosures\" as a control sample. CSDs were defined as \"new information that the offender discloses, which leads to a change in how they are managed, supervised, or risk assessed, or to a change in the treatment intervention that they receive.\" Examples included disclosures relating to increased access to children or contact with other known sex offenders. </p> <p>It seems, however, that these encouraging results were based not upon the ability of the test to detect when offenders are lying, but instead upon the offenders' belief that the test was capable of doing so. This raises serious issues regarding the wisdom of rolling out such a scheme on a mandatory basis across England and Wales.</p> <p>Polygraphs are often wrongly referred to as \"lie detectors\". In fact, all that polygraphs do is measure various psychophysiological indices of arousal, such as skin conductance, blood pressure and respiration. It is assumed that most of us, when we lie, become more emotionally aroused. Polygraph operators claim to be able to detect such tell-tale signs of arousal and use them to determine whether a person is telling the truth or lying. </p> <p>There are several different techniques used in this context, but most rely upon the notion that liars will be more aroused when answering \"relevant\" questions compared with when they answer \"control\" questions, due to their fear that they will be detected.</p> <p>Studies have shown that in general polygraph tests correctly identify about 85% of guilty individuals. This may appear to be impressive at first sight but it is necessary to take into account the proportion of innocent individuals who are wrongly classified as guilty. According to <a href=\"http://www.bps.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/polygraphic_deception_detection_-_a_review_of_the_current_scientific_status_and_fields_of_application.pdf\">a report by the British Psychological Society</a> in 2004, reviews suggest that between 12% and 47% of innocent individuals are also classified as lying. </p> <p>Innocent people may be more aroused by the relevant questions than the control questions for a variety reasons. For example, suppose the suspect did not commit the crime in question but was engaged in some activity at the time that, although perfectly legal, he or she was ashamed of. Alternatively, it may simply be that the suspect is terrified that he or she will not be believed despite their innocence.</p> <p>It is clear from the results of the pilot study that it was the sex offenders' belief that the polygraph would detect deception that led to the increase in disclosures. Not only did most of the these disclosures take place during the polygraph session as opposed to during routine supervision, but they actually took place during the pre-polygraph interview before the test itself was carried out. </p> <p>Indeed, <a href=\"http://kar.kent.ac.uk/2845/\">a previous experiment</a> by the lead author of this pilot study, <a href=\"http://www.kent.ac.uk/psychology/people/gannont/\">Theresa Gannon</a>, clearly showed similar effects among a group of child molesters. Those who were connected up to a convincing, albeit fake, \"lie detector\" gave more honest responses on a questionnaire than those who were not connected.</p> <p>It is clear that offenders only have to spend five minutes on Google to realise that experts generally agree that polygraph testing is in fact not a reliable technique for detecting deception. If such testing becomes mandatory, it is inevitable that this truth about polygraphs will become widely known among offenders. From then on, any effect that unfounded belief in the effectiveness of the technique had in terms of increasing disclosures is likely to disappear.</p> <p>To make matters worse, techniques exist to beat the test. Once the underlying rationale of the test is understood, steps can be taken to either augment the psychophysiological response to control questions (eg via self-induced physical or mental pain) or else reduce the response to relevant questions (eg using mental training, such as meditation). </p> <p>Vaughan Bell described <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/apr/22/lie-detector-fallibility-criminal-psychology\">the case of Floyd \"Buzz\" Fay</a>, who was wrongly convicted of murder on the basis of polygraph testing. During his time in prison, Buzz found out as much as he could about the polygraph and used his knowledge to train other prisoners to beat the test. After a mere 15 minutes of instruction, 23 of 27 inmates were able to beat the test. It is highly likely that a sex offender who was motivated to beat the test and thus give the impression of being low risk would easily be able to do so.</p> <p>There is another reason to be cautious about the results of this pilot testing, one that was noted by the authors themselves. In their words, \"It is possible that polygraph offender managers may have felt more motivated or 'expected' to provide large numbers of CSDs compared to comparison offender managers.\" </p> <p>By its nature, the design of this study could not be <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment\">double- or even single-blind</a> and it is highly likely that this would have had an effect on the results. In other words, the managers' body language and interpretation of offenders' responses could have been subconsciously skewed. </p> <p>The authors of the report estimated that polygraph testing would cost between \u00a3400 and \u00a3937.30 for each additional disclosure that resulted. Obviously, any intervention that might reduce offending is worthy of serious consideration. But we should be cautious about implementing an intervention that might only be effective for the short time it would take before the truth about polygraphs becomes common knowledge among offenders.</p> <p>Perhaps even more worrying is the prospect that a motivated high-risk offender could probably beat the polygraph from the outset after just a little bit of background research.</p>",
  "<p>There is always something wrong with conditions for the north of England's grouse shooters and this year it is spinach.</p> <p>Not that the birds have taken to eating the stuff in the manner of Popeye to develop their ability to hit back; the connection is via a European Union decision to ban the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2011/sep/23/asulam-bracken-spinach-eu-ban\">herbicide Asulam</a> after protests about its effect on spinach growing, largely on the Continent.</p> <p>The link is that Asulam is widely used to suppress or destroy bracken, a plant so skilled at survival that it should have been named after Charles Darwin. The <a href=\"http://www.moorlandassociation.org/\">Moorland Association</a>, which speaks for upland management more widely as well as grouse moor owners and users in particular, views this in apocalyptic terms.</p> <p>With shooting due to start on Monday \u2013 the Glorious 13th this year as the Twelfth falls on a Sunday when game-shooting is <a href=\"http://www.basc.org.uk//en/departments/game-and-gamekeeping/game-shooting/shooting-seasons.cfm\">forbidden by law </a>\u2013 the association is seizing on the media's traditionl, albeit brief, interest to step up its campaign. It says that about \u00a3100 million worth of land management's contribution to the economy is at stake if the ban is not removed or eased.</p> <p>Environmental opinion is divided on the issue, with supporters of the ban arguing that Asulam treatment is the 'lazy option' to manual cutting and uprooting and less effective in the long term. But wage levels and the depopulation of the uplands has made labour-intensive management more difficult.</p> <p>The Moorland Association's vice-chairman George Winn-Darley, who manages 6,500 acres of heather moorland in North Yorkshire, says: </p> <blockquote> <p>Without the chemical, which has our own Government's approval and has been used successfully and safely for 35 years, our countryside and rural livelihoods will suffer very serious consequences.</p> <p>This will not only adversely affect biodiversity, including red list endangered species, but radically impact on grouse management, jobs and ultimately the appearance of globally important moors. Three quarters of the world's heather moorland is found in the&#xa0;UK. Without Asulam, we would have already lost 50 per cent of it.</p> <p>Grouse breeding will be badly hit, along with the shooting industry, which is worth over \u00a367 million in&#xa0;England&#xa0;alone, creates 42,500 days of work a year and supports over 1,500 jobs. Our members spend vast sums of money managing the moorland habitat.

Protesters may dog some parties although in recent years their policy has been to avoid adding to attention given to the 12th , and the shooting of wild birds such as grouse, in order to concentrate on shortcomings in the breeding of captive game, especially pheasants.</p> <p><em>A second Guardian Northerner post on the launch in Yorkshire of a national Ban the Burn campaign to protect blanket bogs on grouse estates and other uplands <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/aug/10/moorland-drainage-grouse-shooting-hebden-bridge-natural-england\">is here</a>.</em></p>",

Each possessed 22% of the market. Over the following two years, LG tried to copy every move Samsung made, without trying to create any distinction between the brands. Samsung's superior display technology and slightly better hardware build demolished its South Korean rival.</p> <p> HTC learned nothing of this episode -- on the contrary, it has rushed to repeat LG's mistakes with an eerie precision.</p> <p> HTC is guilty of a great folly by refusing to learn from LG's downfall.</p> </blockquote> <p> Kuittinen is an astute observer of this sector.

Patents seek to do this by requiring the inventor to make prompt and full disclosure of the idea, so others may seek a licence to use it, or find ways to work around it. In exchange, the inventor is granted the right to exclude competitors for 20 years or so.</p> <p> The cost to society of allowing a monopoly to flourish has long been assumed to be outweighed by the benefits that accrue from encouraging individuals to spend their own resources inventing useful things that did not exist before. In short, patents have been seen as a necessary evil for fostering innovation.</p> <p> That assumption is now being challenged.</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20120807133033596\">SCO Files for Chapter 7: \"There is no reasonable chance of 'rehabilitation'\" &gt;&gt; Groklaw</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>SCO Group has now <a href=\"http://www.groklaw.net/pdf3/SCOGBK-1419.pdf\">filed</a> [PDF] for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection.

  "<p>US Treasury secretary Tim Geithner has reassured George Osborne that US regulators investigating breaches of sanctions by Standard Chartered will try to coordinate their actions.</p> <p>As the London-based bank prepares for a hearing with New York state's department of finance services regulator, which has accused it of moving $250bn of Iranian money around the financial system, the chancellor has sought assurances that the bank will be treated fairly.</p> <p>Osborne and his team spoke to Geithner and officials on Tuesday and received assurances that the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) would work with the myriad of other regulators looking at Standard Chartered's dealing with Iranian clients between 2001 and 2007.</p> <p>Sir Meryvn King, the governor of the Bank of England, had already called publicly for the US regulators to work together after the surprise decision by the New York regulator to publish an order against Standard Chartered on Monday.</p> <p>While the bank had known since 2010 it was being investigated for breaches of sanctions \u2013 it had shared information with regulators \u2013 it had not expected the New York regulator to go it alone in making public the alleged range of the breaches of the rules.</p> <p>A government source said the chancellor had been deploying quiet diplomacy in contacting his US counterpart amid claims that some US politicians were trying to undermine London's position as a financial centre. Osborne, however, is thought to have made clear that breaches of rules should not be tolerated.</p> <p>The credit rating agency Fitch warned on Thursday that it might downgrade the bank's credit rating as result of the accusations, which the bank strongly denies.</p> <p>Fitch said: \"The accusations and strong market reactions to it have damaged the bank's reputation and it is possible that its franchise will suffer depending on how and when the case is resolved.\"</p> <p>There is speculation that the regulators would agree on a fine for the bank before Wednesday's hearing although this seems unlikely given the scale the disagreement between Standard Chartered and the regulatory bodies.</p> <p>Peter Sands, the bank's chief executive, argues that while the regulator is focusing on $250bn of payments channelled for Iranian clients, the bank believes that the sum is closer to $14m.</p> <p>The discrepancies relate to interpretation of the rules on U-turns which allow the banks to deal with Iranian clients as long as the money does not end up in US bank accounts.</p>",
  "<p>Manchester United has slashed the price of its shares in advance of its debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.</p> <p>The club had been set to sell its shares for between $16-$20 (\u00a310-\u00a313) a share but cut the price to $14 late on Thursday following negative comments from Wall Street analysts and Facebook's disappointing stock market debut in May.</p> <p>Even after the cut, United will be valued at $2.3bn (\u00a31.5bn), making it the most valuable football club in the world. Real Madrid, its closest rival in financial terms, is valued at $1.88bn, according to an annual ranking by Forbes magazine.</p> <p>The shares are being sold by the Glazers, a US family who made their fortune with shopping malls and trailer parks and also own the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p> <p>The Glazers bought United in 2005 for about $1,250m (\u00a3800m). They are selling 16.7m shares, equal to a 10% stake, and will raise about $330m (\u00a3210m). The family will net about $140m from the flotation.</p> <p>The club claims a global fan base of about 660m and has won a record 19 league titles. Its share sale will be the largest sports listing on record, surpassing World Wrestling Federation's $190m IPO in 1999, according to Thomson Reuters.</p> <p>It will also be the most high profile since Facebook's ill-fated debut on the Nasdaq stock exchange in May. The social network's much hyped share sale proved a bust and shares initially sold at $38 are now worth $20.</p> <p>Wall Street analysts have warned they believe United's sale could also be a disappointment. \"I'm calling this 'son of Facebook',\" said David Menlow, president of the research firm IPOfinancial.com.</p> <p>He said too little of the money being raised looked like it was going to be invested in the club, the club had too many debts and it wasn't clear how it intended to grow as a business.</p> <p>\"Sports franchises have this emotional flourish, then everybody wakes up and wonders, 'do I really want to own this',\" he said.</p> <p>Sam Hamadeh, founder of New York-based analyst PrivCo, called United \"a collectible not an investment\". \"This is one for the rabid fan,\" he said.</p> <p>This is the Glazer family's third attempt at a share sale, having previously scrapped efforts to sell shares on exchanges in Hong Kong and Singapore.</p> <p>Those sales failed as investors balked at United's proposed dual class share structure. Under the US listing the family will retain control of the club through class B shares that have 10 times more voting power than the publicly-traded class A shares.</p> <p>The company is also taking advantage of recently-introduced US laws that limit the financial disclosures it must make. United is raising capital as an \"emerging growth\" company under US president Barack Obama's recently passed Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or Jobs, Act.</p> <p>The move means United will not be required to file quarterly reports or be subject to the same level of financial scrutiny as other US-listed firms for five years.</p> <p>Some of the proceeds from the sale are expected to be used to pay down some of the 134-year-old club's debt, which was last reported to be about $661m. But the Glazer family had originally claimed all the proceeds would go towards United's debt, angering some fans.</p> <p>A leading fan group has called for a boycott of the club's sponsors in protest at the terms of the share sale.</p> <p>A statement from the Manchester United Supporters Trust read: \"The Manchester United Supporters Trust has today called for a worldwide boycott of Manchester United sponsors' products, with support across the UK, Europe, Asia and the US. The boycott strategy is intended to send a loud and clear message to the Glazer family and club sponsors that, without the support and purchasing power of the fans, the global strength of the Manchester United brand doesn't actually exist.\"</p>"
