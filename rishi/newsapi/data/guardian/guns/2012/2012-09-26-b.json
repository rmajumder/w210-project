  "<p>Fewer prosecutions should be brought against police, fire brigade and ambulance staff who commit driving offences while responding to emergencies, according to draft guidance issued by the Crown Prosecution Service on Thursday.</p> <p>There may also be no public interest in charging individuals whose driving results in members of their family or close friends being killed because they will already have suffered overwhelming grief, the same public consultation suggests.</p> <p>The decision to review the guidelines follows criticism earlier this year of the CPS by the Police Federation for prosecuting a Hampshire police officer, PC James Holden, who pursued a serial burglar driving a van that ended up crashing into level crossing barriers.</p> <p>Holden was cleared of dangerous driving and no one was injured in the incident but officers around the country have subsequently been reported to be scared of being prosecuted for answering 999 calls. Many have called for the law to be changed.</p> <p>Launching the public consultation, the director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, explained: \"The issues that arise for prosecutors when deciding to charge someone with a very serious driving offence \u2013 particularly where there has been a fatality \u2013 are inevitably difficult and sensitive.</p> <p>On police, ambulance and fire brigade drivers, the draft guidance advises prosecutors to use discretion in deciding whether or not a prosecution is required in the public interest if an offence is committed while responding to an emergency call.</p> <p>\"It is very unlikely to be appropriate to proceed with a prosecution on public interest grounds if a police officer, ambulance driver or firefighter commits a driving offence while responding to an emergency call unless the driving is dangerous or indicates a high degree of culpability,\" the new advice proposes. In the existing guidance, the equivalent word is simply \"unlikely\".</p> <p>The DPP said: \"Those who work in the emergency services need to know that they can respond to an emergency call without fear of prosecution for doing their job.</p> <p>\"This is not a licence for emergency workers to act with immunity from prosecution, but it is important to appreciate that police officers, ambulance drivers and firefighters sometimes need to drive in a manner which would be not be considered acceptable by other drivers.\"</p> <p>Senior CPS staff must still be consulted in cases involving fatal accidents.</p> <p>In April, following Holden's acquittal, the Police Federation contacted the CPS to raise its concerns. At the time, it warned: \"The real problem is the law and the lack of protection it offers police pursuit drivers \u2026 It seems there is a willingness to hold an officer legally responsible for the danger created by the driver he is pursuing \u2026 Does this mean all officers who pursue could be liable for causing or perpetuating that danger?\" The CPS consultation is partially a response to those fears.</p> <p>In so-called \"nearest and dearest\" cases, the amended guidance indicates it may not be in the public interest to prosecute where a suspect has lost a \"loved one\" as a result of a fatal collision.</p> <p>Starmer said: \"The decision over whether to prosecute can be extremely challenging; for example where a parent's careless or dangerous driving has led to the loss of their own child, which will inevitably bring with it enormous grief and terrible bereavement.</p> <p>\"This circumstance must, of course, be balanced against the need to ensure the safety of other road users \u2013 and if there is evidence to suggest that an individual presents a continuing danger to other road users then the proper course may well be to prosecute on public interest grounds once there is sufficient evidence to do so.\"</p> <p>The changed wordings have now been put out to consultation. Responses to the CPS are due by 8 November 2012.</p>",
  "<p>A judge has told two burglars that if they choose to raid a home where the householders legally own a gun they should accept the risk of being shot.</p> <p>Judge Michael Pert QC made his remarks as he jailed Joshua O'Gorman and Daniel Mansell for four years at Leicester crown court after they were blasted by Andy Ferrie's shotgun while attempting to burgle his farm cottage in Welby, near Melton Mowbray, in the early hours of 2 September.</p> <p>Rejecting a plea that he take into account the shooting, which injured and allegedly \"traumatised\" the defendants, the judge said: \"That is the chance you take.\"</p> <p>O'Gorman, who was shot in the face, and Mansell, who was hit in his right hand, had pleaded guilty to the break-in at an earlier hearing.</p> <p>Alan Murphy, prosecuting, said they had a string of convictions between them.</p> <p>The judge said: \"I make it plain that, in my judgment, being shot is not mitigation. If you burgle a house in the country where the householder owns a legally held shotgun, that is the chance you take. You cannot come to court and ask for a lighter sentence because of it.\"</p> <p>He was responding to a mitigation plea from Andrew Frymann, representing O'Gorman, who said being shot was for his client akin to a \"near-death experience\" for which he was not prepared.</p> <p>Responding to the suggestion that O'Gorman was traumatised, Pert said the Ferries' arrest on suspicion of grievous bodily harm could be considered just as disturbing.</p> <p>\"Some might argue that being arrested and locked up for 40 hours is a trauma,\" he said.</p> <p>Ferrie, 35, and his wife, Tracey, 43, were held in custody for nearly two days after he called police to tell them he fired his shotgun at the intruders.</p> <p>Their arrests prompted widespread criticism. The couple were later bailed and told they would not face criminal charges.</p> <p>Mansell, 33, and O'Gorman, 27, both from Leicester but with no fixed addresses, appeared in the court dock showing physical evidence of the confrontation.</p> <p>A scar was clearly visible on the right side of O'Gorman's face and Mansell had his arm in a sling.</p> <p>Opening the case for the crown, Murphy said the Ferries, who were not in court because they are out of the country, went to bed at their isolated farm cottage as normal on the evening of 1 September.</p> <p>Mr Ferrie shot the burglars after discovering them downstairs and seeing one of them about to reach into a kitchen drawer that held a number of knives.</p> <p>\"As a result of that, Mr Ferrie fired his shotgun. Mr O'Gorman was hit in his face, Mr Mansell in his hand. The burglars fled without actually being able to steal anything.\"</p> <p>The court heard that Mr Ferrie immediately called police to tell them what had happened and found himself subsequently arrested.</p> <p>Police began searching for the intruders and alerted Leicester Royal Infirmary to see if anybody had presented themselves with shotgun injuries, Murphy said.</p> <p>At around 2am, O'Gorman arrived at the hospital with shotgun pellets in his face and was arrested by officers. Mansell arrived a few hours later, at around 7am, with pellet wounds to his right hand and was also detained by police.</p> <p>Both were on licence at the time of the offence.</p>",
  "<p>Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas's heart probably sank when he learnt about this trip to Cumbria but it turned into a minor triumph for Tottenham Hotspur's head coach.</p> <p>With a visit to Manchester United looming on Saturday he managed both to rest a raft of key players and to avoid the sort of embarrassing League Cup exit which could have placed his still fledgling regime on the back foot.</p> <p>Even better, Villas-Boas's understudies did enough to give him a few future selection dilemmas and none more so than Andros Townsend, who capped an eye-catching performance with a fine goal. \"He's very good with the ball at his feet,\" said Villas-Boas's assistant, Steffen Freund, afterwards, adding: \"It's nice to see the young players doing so well.\"</p> <p>One of the older ones also took his opportunity. Tom Huddlestone's authority, control and incisive interceptions may have got his manager wondering if his lack of pace is the end of the world after all.</p> <p>Besides this overhaul Villas-Boas also opted for delegation. Dressed down in a tracksuit, he opted to spend much of the first half quietly in the dug-out, leaving most of the technical area arm-waving and finger-pointing to Freund.</p> <p>If Danny Livesey's clearance off the line from Clint Dempsey denied Freund the chance to punch the air in celebration, Greg Abbott's League One side were showing that they, too, can play a bit.</p> <p>Abbott's entire squad was assembled for \u00a360,000 but he has recruited cleverly and the attacking combination of Danny Cadamarteri, once of Everton, and Kallum Higginbotham, borrowed from Huddersfield, sporadically stretched Michael Dawson and his defensive colleagues to the limit. On more than one occasion Huddlestone was required to drop back from midfield and make last-ditch interventions.</p> <p>With Townsend showing glimpses of promise on the right wing Tottenham took such scares in their stride. Yet, even though they moved the ball slickly and smoothly across a pitch which ranks as one of England's finest, there was clear relief among the away contingent when Jan Vertonghen, the visiting left-back for the night, headed Gylfi Sigurdsson's floated delivery beyond Mark Gillespie. Abbott's players had paid the price for Paul Thirlwell's foul on Dempsey and the resulting free-kick which enabled Sigurdsson to show off his dead-ball skills.</p> <p>Gillespie had been stranded when Vertonghen headed the opener and Carlisle's 20-year-old goalkeeper found himself similarly powerless early in the second half when Townsend's superb low left-foot shot into the bottom corner from just outside the area eluded him.</p> <p>Abbott responded with a triple substition. It was a big moment for two of the newcomers, Mark Beck and David Symington, a pair fast-tracked from the youth team who earn only \u00a3150 a week each.</p> <p>Creditably Carlisle never gave up but their diligent pressing was ultimately no match for their guests who scored a deserved third when Sigurdsson headed the substitute Kyle Walker's cross past Gillespie to score his first Spurs goal.</p>",
  "<p>The Drudge Report, which I've always considered more mischievous than malicious, gave \"<a href=\"http://unskewedpolls.com/\">Unskewedpolls.com</a>\" some link love earlier this week. The site tinkers with the poll results of major firms by re-weighting them according to the national proportions of Democrats to Republicans, as determined by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/25/gallup-rasmussen-polling-outliers-lean-republican\">notoriously GOP-friendly Rassmussen</a> group. Fans of the \"unskewed polls\" see them as a way of countering what conservative critics consider to be the \"undercounting\" Republican votes. </p> <p>I have trouble with figuring how, exactly, the creator of Unskewed polls comes to the cheerful outcomes he does: it seems like the most simplistic kind of magical thinking. The site has led to many mocking \"unskewed\" <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5945948/conservative-site-mitt-romney-is-winning-if-you-just-change-the-polls-to-make-him-win\">assertions</a> and representatives of the firms have expressed a more gentle befuddlement with the project:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"'Why would pollsters want to look inaccurate?,' [director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, Lew ]Miringoff <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/09/are-polls-skewed-too-heavily-against-republicans/262834/\">asked</a> rhetorically in a phone interview.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>At their heart, Unskewed Polls express a pseudoscientific rationalization for a pre-existing belief: the mathematical equivalent of intelligent design. But the site represents more than just modern conservatism's skepticism about science; it underscores what has become a more animating and alarming concern \u2013 conservatives' distrust of democracy as a process.</p> <p>This is nothing new, of course. Edmund Burke railed with a kind of admirable irascibility against democracy (\"A perfect democracy is, therefore, the most shameless thing in the world\"). Closer to home, the Anti-Federalists pitched a near-victorious battle in the United States against more direct forms of democracy, which they saw as inevitably victim, as James Madison put it, to \"the turbulency and weakness of unruly passions\". They pushed successfully for the US constitution to mandate election of senators by state legislatures and not voters \u2013 a quaint affectation that was superseded by the 17th amendment in 1913.</p> <p>There is a growing movement <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/08/16/repeal_the_17th_amendment/\">among</a> Republican elected officials to repeal that amendment; among those advocates are five Republican Senate nominees.</p> <p>In my darker moments, I have some sympathy with the anti-democratic arguments: I wonder if I really want the same populace that made Kim Kardashian famous selecting the brains trust responsible for acts of war. (Granted, Kim Kardashian couldn't have made a worse hash of Iraq than the Bush team did. In fact, she might have gotten out of it sooner.)</p> <p>However, it is one thing to wonder if the mass electorate can make good decisions and quite another to back-engineer the exclusion of a specific class of voters for the sake of a specific outcome. That, of course, is what <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/18/voter-id-laws-roll-purges-fraud\">voter ID laws</a> do.</p> <p>But voter ID laws are just a specific, particularly obvious example of a generalized contempt for voters. A better reflection of the mood: Romney's careless dismissal of 47% of America. The comment wasn't just callous and strategically idiotic (Karl Rove, who masterminded the GOP's outreach to \"ungettable\" voters, must have hurt his head banging it against the wall when he heard); it reflected also the apparently widespread presumption among GOP supporters that democracy is a zero-sum game \u2013 and that voters are motivated out of greed.</p> <p>Scratch a conservative argument for voter ID, or in support of Romney's videoed comments, and you usually get this quote:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the majority discovers it can vote itself largesse out of the public treasury.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Notwithstanding whatever it is that motivates voting for the candidate proposing the largest tax cuts, conservatives who parrot this quote aren't really sounding the alarm against the end of democracy; they are arguing against democracy, full stop. Rush Limbaugh is fond of <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/online/rush-limbaugh-america-could-survive-four-more-years-of-obama/\">this formulation</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I think that the country could survive four more years of Obama \u2026 But I don't believe the country can survive in a country full of people who would re-elect him.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The next step in such a logic chain is to keep those who would re-elect him from voting. We had to burn our freedoms in order to save them, or some such.</p> <p>Ironically, the \"largesse\" quote that sounds so delightfully authoritive \u2013 it is often attributed to <a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alexis_de_Tocqueville\">Tocqueville</a>, or, more frequently, Scottish (so no wonder he's grumpy) historian Alexander <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Fraser_Tytler\">Tytler</a> \u2013 goes no further back than 1951: it was first <a href=\"http://www.issues4life.org/pdfs/19511209_thedailyoklahoman.pdf\">found</a> in an op-ed in the Daily Oklahoman.</p> <p>Tytler, in real life, was certainly a curmudgeon about the sustainability of democracy, but the misattributed quote captures all of his pessimism about the process without any of his sympathy for the people who are a part of it. Tytler was suspicious about how much could be achieved in a democracy not because he thought the electorate was greedy, but because the elected officials were even more selfish:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"But those governors once selected, where is the boasted freedom of the people? They must submit to their rule and control, with the same abandonment of their natural liberty, the freedom of their will, and the command of their actions, as if they were under the rule of a monarch.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Tytler grudgingly accepted that democracy, with all its faults, stood the best chance of securing the maximum liberty for the greatest number of people:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[T]his form of government is the best adapted to produce, though not the most frequent, yet the most striking, examples of virtue in individuals.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>You can almost hear him sigh and cue up \"The Daily Show\" on his DVR.</p> <p>Republicans' assault on democracy (the voter ID laws, the repeal of the 17th amendment, the creeping disempowerment of women) is probably designed to <em>scare</em> those exact voters they want to disenfranchise as much as it is to legally disenfranchise them. Anti-voter ID activists often say that making someone believe their vote won't count is as effective as actually barring the vote.</p> <p>Tytler offers some hope on this score. Of patriotism <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=TjY-AAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=passions&amp;f=false\">he wrote</a>. </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Like all other affections it operates with the greatest force where it meets with greatest difficulties. It seems to be a virtue which grows from which subsists in its greatest vigor amidst turbulence dangers, but in a state of ease and safety as if wanting its nourishment it languishes and decays.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So, you know, bring it on. It's not the 47% that needs to worry; it's Romney.</p>",
  "<p>The national Republican party appears to be thawing its attitude towards controversial Senate candidate Todd Akin and preparing to raise money for his campaign after a deadline for him to drop out of his race in Missouri passed.</p> <p>Akin was cut off by the party leadership \u2013 including presidential candidate Mitt Romney \u2013 in August after saying in an interview that women could not become pregnant in cases of \"legitimate rape\". The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), which raises cash for candidates, withdrew $5m worth of advertising support for the Missouri campaign and Romney led calls for Akin to step down. Akin, however, refused to quit.</p> <p>But now the NRSC has indicated that its principled stand may have been overtaken by realpolitik, saying it will \"monitor\" Akin's fight against Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill.</p> <p>\"Todd Akin is a far more preferable candidate than liberal senator Claire McCaskill. As with every Republican Senate candidate, we hope Todd Akin wins in November, and we will continue to monitor this race closely in the days ahead,\" NRSC executive director Rob Jesmer said in a statement <a href=\"http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/nrsc-takes-fresh-look-at-todd-akin\">first reported by Talking Points Memo</a>.</p> <p>A week ago, NRSC chairman John Cornyn was asked by The Hill if the group would back Akin and he replied: \"We're done.\"</p> <p>The distinct change in tone almost certainly reflects the fact that Akin is now certain to be the Republican candidate in a race that is vital for eventual control of the entire Senate \u2013 a prize even more important to the Republicans with Romney falling behind in the White House election.</p> <p>The shift of the party also likely reflects Akin's relatively healthy position in the opinion polls. Though Akin's comments over rape outraged women's groups and made headline news across the country, he has remained competitive with McCaskill.</p> <p>Patty Murray, a Washington senator and chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, denouned the NRSC's reversal as \"absolutely shameful\". She said: \"I expected more, but sadly, Todd Akin represents the official position of the Republican Party.\"</p> <p>Missouri Democrats said they were unsurprised by the shift. Jim Sanders, the state party chair, <a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/09/todd-akin-nrsc-democrats.phphttp://\">told Talking Points Memo</a>: \"We've always expected these dollars to flow in. So when you heard from the Republican side the outcry that 'we're going to pull away from Todd Akin' we never thought that would be the case.\"</p> <p>Akin has become a rallying point for several high-profile conservatives within the national party who laud his social conservative stances on issues like abortion.</p> <p>Earlier on Wednesday former presidential contender Rick Santorum and Tea Party favourite South Carolina senator Jim DeMint issued a joint statement in support of Akin. \"Todd Akin is a principled conservative who is committed to winning and fighting for freedom in the US Senate,\" the politicians said, praising Akin for his principles on debt reduction and being against Barack Obama's healthcare reforms.</p> <p>Akin is now likely to receive cash help for his campaign from Super Pacs that support Santorum and DeMint. In a brief statement he thanked the two for supporting him. \"I am proud to have two of our country's leading conservatives endorse me today \u2026 our country can't afford another six years of the liberal agenda of Claire McCaskill,\" Akin said.</p> <p>Another former presidential hopeful, ex-House Speaker Newt Gingrich, has also taken a firm line in defending Akin and helping to pour money into his campaign coffers. On Monday, Gingrich hosted a fundraising lunch for Akin which saw donors coughing up $500 each to attend.</p> <p>In another sign that the Republican party as a whole is now rallying behind Akin, the state party in Missouri has also now firmly backed him. \"We are confident that Todd will defeat McCaskill in November, and the Missouri Republican party will do everything we can to assist in his efforts,\" the party said in a statement.</p> <p>However, even if money does once again start to pour into Akin's campaign, he still faces an uphill battle in the cash stakes. According to the Center for Responsive Politics McCaskill had raised $10m more than Akin through the first half of 2012. </p> <p>But the change in opinion by outside figures does represent a remarkable turnaround for Akin. In the wake of his rape comments, which were made in the context of defending a 'no-exceptions' belief when it came to abortion, his political career was virtually written off. Democrats and Republicans alike queued up to condemn him and ask him to step aside for a new candidate, and he became the punchline to the jokes of late-night comedians.</p> <p>His determination to stay in the race has now firmly paid off. Missouri's other Senator, Republican Roy Blunt, had once called for Akin to quit but has now promised support. \"I'll be working for the Republican ticket in Missouri, and that includes Todd Akin,\" he said last week.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> Good evening everybody and welcome to tonight's coverage of a match that won't be featuring anywhere near the top of either club's list of priorities for this season, but which will hopefully be worth watching nonetheless. Considering the weather, the game being televised and the cheapest tickets available to adult home fans that aren't OAPs cost \u00a330 (visiting adult Geordies have had to fork out \u00a345!), we're unlikely to have anything resembling a full house at Old Trafford tonight, but we might get to see some bright new prospects line up for both sides. More seasoned lags such as Darren Fletcher and Wayne Rooney should also feature. The former continues his return from debilitating illness, while the latter is expected to return from a debilitating bloody great hole in the leg.</p> <p>Angelo Henriquez, Nick Powell, Alex Buttner and Michael Keane are among the whelps who are expected to either start or come on as substitutes for Manchester United at some point tonight. Midfielder Powell and left-back Buttner have already featured in the Premier League against Wigan this season, with both players scoring and the Dutch defender picking up the man of the match fizz. Keane made his only appearance for United in this competition last season and is not to be (but perhaps often is) confused with twin brother Will, who also plays for United. Finally recruited from Universidad de Chile after a bit of an administrative nightmare earlier this month, Henriquez scored 11 goals in 17 appearances for the Chilean side last season.</p> <p>Newcastle manager Alan Pardew has signalled his intention to select a pretty experienced side this evening, with midfielder Cheikh Tiote and centre-half Fabricio Coloccini likely to return from injury. \"\"Obviously, as a manager, you are going to protect players for competitions you think are more important to grow as a club and we are trying to grow here,\" said Pardew ahead of tonight's match, adding: \"I know one thing, the team I put out will have to be able to win.\"</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Team news:</strong> Wayne Rooney returns from injury to take his place in the Manchester United line-up tonight, while Darren Fletcher is named skipper on his first start for 10 months. He'll lead out a team featuring a back four with just two appearances between them; Marnick Vermijl and Scott Wooton are handed their debuts.</p> <p>For Newcastle, as expected, Cheick Tiote makes only his second appearance of the season, whilst Fabricio Coloccini returns after a three-match absence.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Random bit of trivia while we wait for the line-ups to appear on the wires, so that I can copy-and-paste rather than type them out:</strong> It's been 40 years since Newcastle United won away at Old Trafford.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Man Utd:</strong> De Gea, Vermiji, Wootton, Keane, Buttner, Cleverley, Fletcher, Anderson, Rooney, Welbeck, Hernandez. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Johnstone, Evans, Powell, Lingard, Brady, King, Tunnicliffe.</p> <p><strong>Newcastle:</strong> Elliot, Perch, Williamson, Coloccini, Tavernier,<br>Obertan, Tiote, Gosling, Marveaux, Vuckic, Shola Ameobi. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Harper, Anita, Cisse, Amalfitano, Bigirimana, Sammy Ameobi, Ferguson.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Anthony Taylor (Cheshire)</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>A pre-match email:</strong> \"Marneck Vermilj, United's starting right-back, does not even have a Wikipedia page,\" writes Dan Schulwolf. \"Surely this is the sign of a club in crisis.\"</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Alan Pardew speaks:</strong> In his pre-match interview, the Newcastle manager says he and his backroom team have noticed that Manchester United's defence \"look a bit light on set pieces\" and is duly applaiuded by the pundits for showing his hand before the match has started.</p> <p>Fair dues, he could have not mentioned it, but noticing that your opposition are lining up with four defenders with two appearances between them, then pointing out that it might be a good idea to batter them with Shola Ameobi hardly merits a Manager of the Month award. </p> <p>Oh ... speaking of Alan Pardew - <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqAy_U_px8o\">you may well have seen this already</a>. Presuming <em>he</em> has, I wonder did he feel really disturbed or secretly pleased upon viewing it for the first few times.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Javier Hernandez kneels just to the right of the centre-circle for his pre-match pray:</strong> Once he's done, the referee blows the whistle and Newcastle kick off playing from right to left into the Stretford End.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> I thought Darren Fletcher was going to play on the right side of midfield, but he appears to have taken up a position just in front of a back four comprising Vermiji at right-back, Scott Wootton and Michael Keane in the centre and Alex Buttner at left-back. In midfield, we have Fletcher in a withdrawn role behind Cleverley and Anderson, then Rooney, Welbeck and Hernandez up front.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> If United's defensive whelps are nervous tonight, they're hiding it well. Buttner has already had a shot on goal, which fizzed over Rob Elliot's crossbar, while Marnick Vermiji has just sent in a cross from the right that was perfectly placed for Javier Hernandez, who sent a header flashing across the face of goal and wide.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Newcastle are playing a 4-4-2, with the back four much as you'd expect, Obertan on the right of midfield, Marveaux on the left and Tiote and Gosling in the middle. Vuckic and Ameobi form a two-pronged attack.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Newcastle win a free-kick on the left flank for a Scott Wootton foul on Haris Vuckic. Marveaux stands over the ball waiting for Newcastle's centre-halves to come up and exert pressure on the Manchester United defence. The delivery to the far post is perfect and Mike Williamson rises highest to head the ball goalwards, only for Fabricio Coloccini to get in his way, handle the ball and concede a free to Manchester United.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Another free-kick for Newcastle from which nothing comes and Anderson launches a counter-attack. His pass-selection is poor and he plays the ball right to Javier Hernandez on the right flank, where Rooney and Cleverley were galloping forward in a two-on-one against James Perch on the left.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Another free-kick a long way out for Newcastle and the ball is pumped into the box again. United half-clear, Shola Ameobi picks up the loose ball and attempts to get it in the box, only for Haris Vuckic to be flagged for offside.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> Newcastle get the ball into the box for Shola Ameobi, who knocks it down to Dan Gosling, standing unmarked about 12 yards out. The midfielder takes a swing, but scuffs his shot, passing up a glorious opportunity to open the scoring for Newcastle.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Splendid save from Newcastle goalkeeper Rob Elliot, who tips a rasping Anderson drive around the pass when the Brazilian looked certain to score after picking up the ball in midfield, passing to Rooney and picking up the return and holding off Coloccini for long enough to unleash his shot.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> Prior to the Anderson goal chance, Wayne Rooney appealed for a penalty after going to ground as James Tavernier tried to get goal side of the striker as he attempted to pick up a diagonal pass from Anderson. Should it have been a penalty? I've seen it once in real time and once in slow motion and still can't say for sure. Who'd be a referee?</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> \"Ferguson has received quite a bit of criticism for not signing a combative central midfielder in the summer, and justifiably so,\" writes David Wall. \"But is there a more sympathetic interpretation in that perhaps, that he wanted to give a bit of encouragement to Darren Fletcher, that he would still have an important part to play for them if and when he was able to return to fitness? It's quite well established how highly Fergie thinks of Fletcher, especially with him being a fellow Scot, and with his developing to justify his place after a slow start when he received a lot of criticism from fans. Or is that being too charitable and Ferguson's wine has more likely blinded him to what's lacking in his midfield rather than make him mellow in his old age?\"</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Another goal chance for Manchester United, with Javier Hernandez grinning sheepishly and waving apologetically to his team-mates after scuffing wide at the far post when he should have done better.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> \"Bearing in mind the wave of near-constant mediocrity that Obertan has ridden over the last few years, exactly how well do you think he would have to play tonight to make Fergie regret shunting him out of Old Trafford?\" asks Matt Dony. </p> <p>To be honest, Matt, I think with over one quarter of this match having already elapsed and Mr Obertan having contributed nothing to the Newcastle cause thus far, I'm not sure there's enough time left for him to do all that would be required to make Fergie regret shunting him out of Old Trafford.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Another free-kick for Newcastle, halfway inside the Manchester United half, out on the left flank. Newcastle settle into their established routine of waiting for centre-backs Williamson and Coloccini to lumber up the pitch to try to get on the end of Sylvain Marveaux's long ball into the box. Their trip is wasted on this occasion, as the Frenchman sends the ball swirling into the arms of David De Gea.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Rooney shows his class, playing a marvellous 40-yard pass up the left touchline to Danny Welbeck. The No19 brings it under control, cuts inside and unleashes a low diagonal drive. Rob Elliot saves well.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Ooh, what's this ...</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> Gabriel Obertan does his best to make Alex Ferguson regret shunting him out of Old Trafford by picking up the ball on the right flank, looking up to see where his team-mates are and deftly playing a cross nowhere near any of them and straight into the arms of David De Gea.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> That's a terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, <em>terrible</em> miss from Tom Cleverley, who has yet to score a goal for Manchester United. It was the move of the match, with Hernandez playing a pass from the right-flank to Welbeck on the edge of the penalty area. He laid off for Rooney, who couldn't quite get to it. The ball broke for the following-up Hernandez and he put it on a plate for Cleverley, who shot wide of a gaping goal from 10 yards out with only Elliot to beat.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> Newcastle win a corner, then another. Marveaux takes both, taking an eternity to jog from one quadrant to the other. Manchester United clear, with the camera cutting to Anderson, who chooses that exact moment to lift his shirt to check something on his waist. I say this from a position of weakness, but he's carrying a <em>lot</em> of excess baggage for a professional athlete - there's definite muffin-top flab discernible hanging over his shorts.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> That last entry reminds of the time that Eamon Dunphy once got them to stop a piece of VT on Irteland's answer to Match of the Day, so he could use his electronic marker to draw a big ring around the clearly fat backside of John Hartson, then of Wimbledon, to demonstrate what was wrong with the team. \"Look at the size of that, Bill!\" he said, or words to that effect. \"That's what's wrong with Wimbledon right there.\"</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Manchester United 1-0 Newcastle (Anderson 44):</strong> Em ... Anderson uses his considerable weight to hold off Dan Gosling as he moved from right to left across the outside of the penalty area, before unleashing a drive that left Rob Elliot with no chance. That's a fine strike.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> Manchester United go in at half-time a goal up courtesy of Anderson's first goal for nearly a year.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>A trip down memory lane with Geoff Ashworth:</strong> \"Re. the reference to the last time Newcastle won at OT being 1972,\" he says. \"I was at that game. Correct me if I am wrong, but Newcastle had just been dumped out of the FA Cup by non-league Hereford the week before. I could tell they were up for the game at OT when, at kick off, they had the most determined, committed body language. I knew MUFC would have a bad day. I bet Newcastle had the early version of the hair drier treatment that week!\"</p> <p>As much as I would love to correct you if you are wrong, Geoff, I'm afraid I can't without consulting the record books. I was no more than a mischievous gleam in my father's eye in 1972 and wasn't born until the following year.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>I can confirm</strong> that Newcastle's defeat at the hands of Hereford and their last win over Manchester United at Old Trafford were both in February 1972. I wouldn't be conceived for another four or five months.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>An email from Simon McMahon:</strong> \"This game needed an Alan Partridge moment,\" he writes. \"Trust Anderson to deliver it. BOOF! Eat my goal! The goalkeeper (and MBM reporter) has football pie all over his face.\"</p> <p>At the risk of sounding pedantic, I think you'll find <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZhysyhUL9k\">the goalkeeper (and MBM reporter) has football pie all over his <em>shirt</em></a>. He must have a foot like a traction engine.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>Second half is go.</strong> I don't think there have been any changes on either side, although I can't be certain because I was eating a Twix when the teams emerged for the second half. Unprofessional, I know, but I didn't remember it was in my pocket until near the end of half-time.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Danny Welbeck beats his man on the left and plays the ball across the edge of the penalty area to Anderson, who blasts the ball ridiculously high over the bar and then waves an apology at his provider.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Not for the first time tonight, Marnick Vermiji pings a beautiful cross in towards the near post from the right. Javier Hernandez tries to flick the ball in at the near post from close range, but can't get enough purchase on it and skims it wide.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Shola Ameobi tries a snap-shot from the edge of the Manchester United penalty area, but can only scuff the ball into the arms of David De Gea.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> A promising looking Newcastle move ends with Sky co-commentator Alan Smith (the Arsenal old boy, not the Emmerdale Eminem) sighing \"... but a waste at the end\". The camera immediately cuts to Newcastle No25 Gabriel Obertan looking doleful.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Good play from Vuckic with his back to goal in the Manchester United penalty area. He picks up a straightforward pass from Coloccini, shimmies this way and that before turning his man and unleashing a shot that curls a foot the wrong side of the right post.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> \"Could clubs not start registering loyal fans as players and then rewarding them with a run out as a late substitute in League Cup games?\" asks Kevin Porter. \"It might revive some of my flagging interest in the competition.\"</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Manchester United 2-0 Newcastle United (Cleverley 57):</strong> After some scintillating build-up play from Manchester United, Welbeck picks up a pass from Rooney and plays the ball across the face of the penalty area to Tom Cleverley in the centre. Despite Newcastle having men back in numbers, he looks up, picks his spot and curls the ball around the James Perch and past Rob Elliot to score his first goal for Manchester United just inside the right post of the goal in front of the Stretford End.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> Cheick Tiote's been booked for a foul in the build-up to that goal. Tip of the hat to ref Anthony Taylor for playing the advantage which enabled Cleverley to score.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Rooney tries to curl onew into the top right-hand corner from just outside the D on the Newcastle penalty area, but his effort goes wide.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Manchester United 2-1 Newcastle (Cisse 60):</strong> That has to be the most sensational, inspired double-substitution of all time. Shane Ferguson and Papiss Cisse replace Coiloccini and Vuckic and 65 seconds later, the former crosses to the far post from the left and the latter heads home from about three feet out to put Newcastle right back in this cup tie.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> In the Newcastle penalty area, Hernandez picks up a pass from Rooney and <em>rattles</em> the crossbar with a surface-to-air screamer from about 10 yards out.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> I stand corrected. Replays show Little Pea rattled the crossbar from exactly six-yards.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Rooney sends a corner in from the left, Newcastle fail to clear and the ball breaks kindly for Michael Keane. His stabbed effort goes wide.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Newcastle substitution: Gael Bigirimana on, Cheick Tiote off.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> With his side's three substitutes used, somewhere out on the right flank for Newcastle, Gabriel Obertan is wondering exactly <em>how</em> ineffectual he has to be to merit the shepherd's crook.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Newcastle attack, with James Tavernier trying to pick out Papiss cisse with a ball through the middle. Michael Keane, not the first shaven-headed man of that name to line-up for Manchester United, clears.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> The camera cuts to Mick Tunnicliffe in the stand at Old Trafford. You probably haven';t heard of him, but several years ago, he went to the bookies and placed a \u00a3100 bet on his nine-year-old boy Ryan playing for Manchester United's first team some day at odds of 100-1 ...</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Manchester United substitution: Ryan Tunnicliffe on ... I was so caught up in the romance of the story about his father winning \u00a310,000 that I didn't see who he replaced. Gah! Wayne Rooney's also gone off, to be replaced by Nick Powell.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Now it's the Manchester United crossbar that's left rattling, after Papiss Cisse chests the ball down with his back to goal, reverses back into the two young 'uns standing behind him and then unleashes an overhead kick that beats David De Gea and crashes off the woodwork. Marvellous effort.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> That's twice now I've had players firing at their own goalkeepers - those Olympics and Paralympics have me destroyed - I've had no minute-by-minute pre-season and am very rusty. Apologies.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Newcastle go on the attack, but a wayward pass from Dan Gosling flies over the head of James Tavernier and out for a throw-in. Manchester United use the break in play to send on their third substitute: Robbie Brady on for his debut, Alex Buttner off. Brady's an Irishman, who scored on his debut for the Republic of Ireland against Oman at Craven Cottage during the recent international break.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Manchester United attack on the break, but a fast and loose pass from Powell to Cleverley gifts possession back to Newcastle.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>90+1 min:</strong> Strangely, the dying stages have been the least lively of an entertaining game. Not much time left for Newcastle now. De Gea takes a goal-kick for Manchester United, but Anderson is penalised as the ball drops from the sky, giving the Toon a free-kick just outside their own box.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>93 min:</strong> Elliot lumps the ball forward and Williamson gets the flick-on, but sends the ball skidding wide.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>90+4 min:</strong> Although the cameras don't show it, the commentator's pompous complaint about \"some fool running on to the pitch trying to make a name for himself\" suggests there's a streaker on the field. Waiting to take a corner, Anderson is laughing. The camera cuts to the stands where Alex Ferguson and Wayne Rooney are laughing. The crowd strike up a chorus of \"Fergie! Fergie! Sign him up!\"</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>90+5 min:</strong> The pitch invader is finally removed, Anderson takes the corner short to Rooney, they hold the ballnear the sideline in a bid to run down the clock ...</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>Peep! Peep! Peeeeep!</strong> It's all over. Manchester United are through to the last 16 of the Carling Cup after an accomplished display from their young and inexperienced defence helped out by a few old-timers playing ahead of them. Newcastle will have to wait a while longer to end their 40-year Old Trafford hoodoo.</p>",

Either the minister is lying when he denies using specific words, or he is accusing police officers of lying.

  "<p>With his abject apology for reporting the truth to the nation about the Queen's remarks to the home secretary about Abu Hamza, George Entwistle has failed his first test as BBC director general (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/25/bbc-apologises-queen-abu-hamza1?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 26 September). If the BBC is worth having at all, it must act primarily in the public interest. That means it must override the personal feelings of an octogenarian monarch who, like her eldest son, indulges in a non-constitutional relationship with elected politicians (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/25/government-fights-release-royal-veto-guidelines?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Government fights release of royal veto rules</a>, 26 September).</p> <p>The BBC must now end its subservient and pro-monarchy role and adopt the neutral stance its charter requires in all its conduct.

They cannot have it both ways.<br><strong>Bruce Whitehead</strong><br><em>Edinburgh</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008It is intolerable that BBC managers felt the need to apologise for Frank Gardner's report on the Queen's views and actions. He is a journalist, whose salary is paid by all of us through the licence fee, and was attending the event by virtue of his position with the BBC.</p> <p>Of course, he was fully entitled to let us all know the monarch's views. \"It was&#xa0;a private dinner\" is claimed as the reason for rebuking Gardner, but the definition of \"private\" needs to be examined in relation to the head of state, and it surely cannot be extended to cover situations where journalists are&#xa0;in conversation with the Queen in their professional capacity.<br><strong>Bob Judges</strong><br><em>Leintwardine, Herefordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 By the BBC disclosing that the Queen had concerns over the conduct of Abu Hamza and the impotence of the police and criminal justice system to arrest him and bring charges, it is only iterating what a great many \"ordinary\" people are thinking but are unable or too afraid to speak out, and who are aggrieved that we are forced to accept unacceptable behaviour. The republican pressure group Republic has said that the monarch has needlessly \"waded into this debate\" and that \"it is up to parliament and the courts to deal with these complex issues, not the Queen\".</p> <p>However, there is a precedent. In medieval times, before the primacy of parliament, there was an unwritten but definite compact between the monarch and the common man, in order that the people had some redress against the wrongdoings of \"the over-mighty subject\" and when recourse to legal process was impossible or failing.</p> <p>Inadvertently, is this not the case in this instance, where there has been a flagrant disregard of the rule of law and&#xa0;with no apparent or ready remedy?<br><strong>Bryan Jones</strong><br><em>Redruth, Cornwall</em></p> <p>\u2022 Frank Gardner's slip reminds us that we know virtually nothing about the influence of the Queen over the last 60 years. Biographies are written with none of the primary sources normally regarded as essential.

The Home Office statement quoted in the article bundles the four others into a statement under cover of the notorious Muslim bogeyman Abu Hamza.</p> <p>This does no justice to the fact that Asperger's-diagnosed poet Talha Ahsan and IT specialist Babar Ahmad from Tooting have been detained without charge for six and eight years respectively. The UK is more than capable of trying these men at home, where they were born and paid their taxes. The public is being misled by the image of Hamza, who has been proven to be a foul-mouthed tool of many agendas.</p> <p>I along with many others support the private prosecution initiated by Karl Watkin and believe there is sufficient public interest to bring these young men to trial without sending them away to the US.<br><strong>Dr Fuad Ali</strong><br><em>London</em></p>",
  "<p>It would be hard to imagine a more thankless task at the present moment than defending the Right Honourable member for Sutton Coldfield, parliamentary secretary to the Treasury (as the chief whip is formally known). <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/26/andrew-mitchell-blue-on-blue-editorial\" title=\"\">Andrew Mitchell</a> looks remarkably friendless. He has been derided in these pages, but that derision is surpassed by the venomous <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2208674/Andrew-Mitchell-Has-Chief-Whip-lost-control-fate.html?openGraphAuthor=%2Fdebate%2Fcolumnists%2Fcolumnist-1002343%2FDaily-Mail-Comment.html\" title=\"\">hatred of the Daily Mail</a>, which loathes the Cameron government in any case and particularly despised Mitchell in his previous job. As international development secretary, he was the man who gave rather modest sums of our money away to hungry dusky foreigners, something the Mail truly can't abide.</p> <p>Come to think of it, I shan't seriously try to defend him. Mitchell made a fool of himself, and in a boorish fashion. Even the fact that many of us have lost our temper with aggressive police officers is not much of an excuse, though few would have used Mitchell's esoteric epithet (if he did). Quite whether \"pleb\" is a term of abuse is another question. Everyone seems to have forgotten the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plebs'_League\" title=\"\">Plebs' League</a> \u2013 the Marxist group, originally in the south Wales coalfields, that organised working-class education \u2013 and its Plebs' Magazine, hundred-year-old copies of which are collectors' items.</p> <p>But hang on. If Mitchell is supposed to be the villain of the piece, who are the heroes? Why do we know about the altercation at all? Because one of the officers concerned did what any normal British bobby does, and told the Sun. No heroics there, I suggest. For years past the police have been leaking \u2013 and sometimes selling \u2013 confidential information to the tabloids, contrary to the administration of justice, or basic decency. This has happened to weak and obscure people, and has led to a cause celebre this time only because of Mitchell's prominence. If the officer was aggrieved he should have complained privately, and accepted what would rightly have been a grovelling apology.</p> <p>Instead, everyone has acted in character. David Cameron has briefed against his own chief whip, and may yet illustrate Jeremy Thorpe's quip about Harold Macmillan, an earlier Etonian premier: \"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his friends for his life.\" Cameron forgets (as did Margaret Thatcher) that a prime minister who shows no loyalty to colleagues may not get much in return when it matters, and he forgets also that when the howling pack has tasted blood, it wants more. It could be his turn next. As to the demagogic meddling of the mayor of London \u2013 who thinks it would have been \"wholly commonsensical\" to arrest Mitchell \u2013 it's if nothing else a useful reminder that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/25/boris-johnson-police-andrew-mitchell?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson</a> is never knowingly outshitted. If the Tories really want a cynical unprincipled opportunist as leader, at least they know where to look.</p> <p>We are told that it was the worst possible moment for a minister to insult the police, just after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/18/woman-police-officer-killed-manchester\" title=\"\">deaths of two brave policewomen</a> in Manchester. But it was also just after the real story finally emerged at last about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/hillsborough-disaster\" title=\"\">Hillsborough</a>. On that appalling occasion, gross police incompetence aggravated the tragedy, and the police then behaved in an utterly despicably manner by blaming the victims for heir own deaths.

We have lost the priceless legacy of Sir Robert Peel. Almost uniquely in Europe he gave us not a gun-toting paramilitary gendarmerie but \"citizens in uniform\", an unarmed police force under civilian control. Now we have heavily armed police who often appear to be under no one's control. Politicians bear a heavy responsibility for this, notably Thatcher, who assaulted unions and vested interests with the conspicuous exception of the police: she needed their support in sundry industrial conflicts.</p> <p>And of course she also worked hand in glove with Rupert Murdoch, before whom Tony Blair and Cameron have since knelt in fealty. Wednesday saw the appearance of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/26/rebekah-brooks-andy-coulson-trial-date\" title=\"\">Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson at the Old Bailey</a>. That case continues, as does the investigation into allegations of the corrupt interpenetration of News International and the Metropolitan police. On the whole, it might seem like quite a good if the police kept their distance from the Murdoch tabloids for a while.</p> <p>As to Mitchell, part of his family fortune comes from <a href=\"http://www.elvino.co.uk/the_el_vino_story.htm\" title=\"\">El Vino</a>, the Fleet Street wine bar where we drank in happier days. When his father, Sir David Mitchell, was in parliament, Private Eye used to call him \"the barman MP, as he likes to be known\" (he didn't). Loutish Tory MPs once heckled the former ship's steward John Prescott with shouts of \"Large gin and tonic\". If, as I hope, Mitchell survives the baying mob, Labour MPs could greet him with \"A bottle of Bollinger and three glasses\". That, and a copy of the Plebs' Magazine for Christmas.</p>",

But that gives it a structure, and for me that's useful because often an event will suggest a&#xa0;song for us to play.\"</p> <p>He is quite fastidious about this part of the process. \"I get my notebook out and write down events and births and&#xa0;\u2026\" He allows a faint smile to cross his face. \"At first we did have deaths, too, but death is just a downer, there's no getting round it.\" Cocker fishes a small, violet-coloured notebook from the inside pocket of his jacket and opens it at a random page full of tight, scrawly handwriting. \"So I'll have a look down my notes, and find something like the Mayflower set off for the US on 16 September 1620. And so that made me think of that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9crmJslTCw\" title=\"\">Wooden Ships song by Crosby Stills &amp; Nash</a>. It's helpful to me, and makes me feel that all that random knowledge littered about is in some way useful.\"</p> <p>He is drawn, he says, to songs that are particularly innovative with language. \"And that's why there's quite a lot of spoken-word stuff on the show,\" he says. \"I think that gets overlooked a lot. And that's certainly what I'll latch on to as what I like in a song. I appreciate people who try and use language in an interesting way.\" On other occasions, his research will lead the show into entirely new territory. He calls to mind a recent example: the American musician <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQHaglomIU0\" title=\"\">Korla Pandit</a>. \"I'd never heard of him, but he was born on 16 September 1921. I just thought it was an interesting name, so I looked him up and he was a very interesting guy who made out he was some Indian mystic type of figure and played the organ. So I asked Adam to look into it and we dug out some tracks by him.\"</p> <p>Part of Dineen's job is to wrangle with the troublesome library search engine. \"It's hard to use,\" he says, \"but at the end you get all these offshoots of what you were researching \u2014 like, with the anniversary of the Penny Black stamp, I found a strange seven inch on a label I'd never heard of, a guy singing a strange disco track called Penny Black. And then his son heard it, and he wrote us a letter saying thank you very much.\" The letter, Cocker adds, \"had loads of stamps on the front\".</p> <p>Cocker first arrived at the station as a stand-in for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/shows/stephen_merchant/\" title=\"\">Stephen Merchant</a>. \"And I suppose they thought I did a reasonable job,\" he says. \"I'd always fought against presenting radio really, because my father was a radio DJ in Australia. He's just recently retired. And I kind of didn't want to follow in his footsteps. But I suppose, as we all find as we become older, to some extent we do all become our parents.\" His father did offer him one very useful broadcasting tip. \"He said, 'Turn the headphones up as loud as you possibly can, because then you won't shout at the microphone. You'll just speak to it in a normal way, and that draws the listener in.' And you know what? It's true. Except it's sending me deaf.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/events/hub/artists/jarvis.shtml\">Reading on mobile? Click here to watch the video</a>.</p> <p>Radio presenting has some similarities with his other job, as a solo artist and frontman of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTo7wKumolU\" title=\"\">Pulp</a>. \"It's like a performance,\" he says. \"Not that you would have guessed it, looking through the glass \u2013 there's not a lot of action going on. It's just people in chairs. But there is a performative aspect to it. We try to pick the songs that go well together, we put them in groups of two so they kind of bounce off each other. And similarly, with a concert, you're trying to communicate with the audience, and that's why as much as possible, we try and do the show live, because you can get people involved. Like today, we asked for wedding song suggestions, so they can communicate with you and we can together decide on the last song. And that's nice, you know?\"</p> <p>Sunday afternoon brings a particularly intimate and informal audience. Many listeners text or tweet to say they are busy making their Sunday dinner, and on a rainy day like today, they email in droves. \"That's another part of the concept, I suppose, that it's pretty laid-back,\" says Cocker. \"When I was more of a drinker, I always&#xa0;found that hangovers got to their worst around 4pm. You're over the physical thing, and it goes into a psychological thing by then. So I thought it would be good to do a show that helps you through that difficult time \u2014 without being bland, but being quite soothing.\" He smiles, a slight pursing of the lips. \"To me, it's what Sundays used to be like. At one time we used to say we were bringing the boredom back to Sunday, and that might be overstating it, but it's that kind of thing. That the week's kind of finished, but the new week hasn't begun, so you've got this weird kind of floaty time where you can be a bit more reflective. It's not a massive concept,\" he adds, with typical self-effacement.</p> <p>This weekend, Cocker will present his show from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/a-room-for-london\" title=\"\">A Room for London</a>, a small boat stationed atop the Queen Elizabeth Hall next to the Thames in London. \"Because we're near water, we're going to try and have a little bit of an aquatic theme, looking for writings about the Thames,\" he says. \"We'll have a guy called <a href=\"http://philipsheppard.com/listen-here/\" title=\"\">Philip Sheppard</a>, who plays the electric cello, and did a record called The Diver in the Crypt. We'll do some semi-improvised thing of him playing and me intoning some texts.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00nnx4z\">Reading on mobile?

  "<p>If just one thing can be guaranteed at this weekend's Ryder Cup, it is that both captains will be put through the mill. In 1953, for example, the US captain Lloyd Mangrum estimated that he suffered \"nine thousand deaths in the last hour\" alone. But even though nerve-pulverising intensity is an absolute certainty, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal is primarily worried about his opening ceremony speech. \"That's the part I feel uncomfortable with,\" he says. \"It's tough. We are used to hitting tee shots, chips and putts, but that is so different.\"</p> <p>Olaz\u00e1bal would be wise to keep it short and simple, and double-check all his facts. No Ryder Cup has ever been won as a result of a rousing opening address, but one or two might have been lost. Corey Pavin set the tone for the USA's defeat in 2010 by forgetting to introduce Stewart Cink a slapdash attitude to detail, which later manifested itself in the team's waterproofs (which weren't waterproof).</p> <p>In 2004, the freewheelin' Hal Sutton went one better, forgetting how many children he had. Having thanked his fourth wife Ashley for providing him with three kids, Halimony was forced to quickly backtrack as Mrs Sutton held up four fingers as a prompt. That she didn't configure those fingers in two groups of two is to her credit. Sutton, clearly not at the races, spent the rest of the week gadding about in an outsized cowboy hat, and pairing Tiger Woods with Phil Mickelson. The US were thrashed.</p> <p>But perhaps Nick Faldo's efforts in 2008 did the most to give the opposing team a boost. He referred to Soren Hansen as Soren Stenson, suggested Padraig Harrington had hit more practice shots than there are potatoes in Ireland, and told Graeme McDowell it made little difference whether he came from Northern Ireland or the Republic. A very strange sandwich analogy - \"Cheese next to your name? You'll play all five matches. Tuna means four matches, chicken is three, lettuce is two\" - also fell flat. \"Nick fancies himself as a comedian and he's not funny,\" opined US coach Butch Harmon after the event, which the Americans won easily. Still, stopped clocks and all that. \"See you in Wales,\" began Faldo's valedictory quip at the closing ceremony, \"and bring your waterproofs with you.\" Corey Pavin might wish he'd paid closer attention. </p>",
  "<p>The comedian and television presenter Justin Lee Collins forced his girlfriend to compile a \"dossier\" detailing every sexual experience she had ever had as part of a campaign of abuse, a court has heard.</p> <p>Collins made Anna Larke write down the details in a notebook and would add in the word \"done\" once he was satisfied she had told him everything, it was claimed.</p> <p>The jury at St Albans crown court was told that Collins deprived Larke of sleep, telling her she had to stay awake as long as he did. He made her sleep facing him and would rouse her and criticise her if he saw she had turned away, it was claimed.</p> <p>Collins threw away some of Larke's DVDs on the basis that she found the male actors to be attractive and forced her to close down her email and social networking accounts, the jury was told.</p> <p>In addition, Larke, a public relations worker, was the victim of physical violence during the couple's nine-month relationship last year, it was alleged.</p> <p>During a trip to Miami, Collins is said to have grabbed his partner's hair, pulled her to the floor, pinned her down and spat in her face.</p> <p>On one occasion after returning from filming abroad, Collins accused Larke of infidelity. He is alleged to have slapped her and she was forced to flee screaming for help. On another occasion he threw a sat-nav at her, the court was told.</p> <p>Clips recorded on a mobile phone allegedly catch Collins hurling abuse at Larke. On one, she is accused of having had 50 lovers. She is also accused of having sex \"on a train with different ethnicities\".</p> <p>Collins, 38, denies harassing Larke, who is the same age. The pair met when she helped him move from Bristol to Kew in west London.</p> <p>Peter Shaw, prosecuting, told the jury: \"The main part of that relationship was characterised by this defendant exerting control over her, verbally abusing her and physically assaulting her.\"</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>",
  "<p>Imagine the British landscape with a third fewer trees. That is the chilling prediction being made this week by the <a href=\"http://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/en/Pages/default.aspx#.UGMNa82XPdw\" title=\"\">Woodland Trust</a>.</p> <p>A fungus that has already affected 90% of ash trees in Denmark over the past seven years has now been detected in a handful of locations in the UK. If our government does not act urgently, warns the Woodland Trust, all Britain's estimated 80m ash trees could be lost to the fungal disease known as \"ash dieback\".</p> <p>There is no effective remedy apart from felling and burning affected trees and banning imports of live ash saplings from mainland Europe, where the fungus has taken hold. Some arborists fear such actions might already be too late.</p> <p>As a child, growing up in Cornwall when <a href=\"http://www.forestry.gov.uk/fr/HCOU-4U4JCL\" title=\"\">Dutch elm disease</a> was sweeping the UK, I remember staring up in awe at a row of majestic elms on the daily drive to school. Then, suddenly, they were gone. By the 90s, the disease had claimed more than 25m elms across the UK. But ash dieback could have an even more devastating impact.</p> <p>Alongside oak and birch, ash is one of the most common native broadleaf trees and accounts for roughly 30% of our \"wooded landscape\", which includes parks and hedgerows, as well as woods and forests. It is relatively fast growing, prized as firewood and charcoal, and its strength and elasticity means it has a variety of&#xa0;uses \u2013 gates, tool handles, oars and furniture.</p> <p>\"The loss of ash on this scale would be an environmental disaster,\" says Norman Starks, the Woodland Trust's operations director. \"The impact on woodland biodiversity would be huge. We can delay it by using the English Channel as a barrier and banning imports of live saplings. But there is a danger that we will just shrug our shoulders and then have to explain to future generations why we failed to act.\"</p> <p>Dr John Morgan, head of the Forestry Commission's Plant Health Service, agrees that the fungus poses a serious threat, but says there is not enough evidence yet to suggest all ash trees will be lost should the fungus take hold. \"We still don't know for sure how it will respond to conditions in Britain, but I'd be surprised if we lost more than 90% of our ash. However, the only reliable control is banning imports.\"</p> <p>The financial cost of losing all of our ash is incalculable, but it would also damage our cultural heritage. The origin of the word \"ash\" is often attributed to the Anglo-Saxon term for spear, a&#xa0;common use of the tree in past centuries. Odin, the feared Viking god, hanged himself on an ash tree \u2013 known as the \"world tree\", or Yggdrasil \u2013 as a sacrificial ordeal. And many previous generations have celebrated the ash's \"healing\" properties.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 November 2012 because the original referred to a fungus \"that has already killed 90% of ash trees in Denmark over the past seven years\".</p>",
  "<p>In 1940, when <a href=\"http://www.johngoddard.info/\" title=\"\">John Goddard </a>was 15, he made a list of everything he wanted to achieve. There were 127 goals in all, which included: visit every country in the world; explore the Great Barrier Reef; watch a cremation ceremony in Bali; milk a poisonous snake; and visit the Moon. Some goals were bundled together. Number 113, for example, reads: \"Become proficient in the use of a plane, motorcycle, tractor, surfboard, rifle, pistol, canoe, microscope, football, basketball, bow and arrow, lariat and boomerang.\" There is a tick beside this one, marking it as done, as there is beside 109 of those original goals. And in the years since, he has set himself hundreds more, writing them down as a form of commitment.</p> <p>Goddard's \"Life List\", which featured in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/aug/24/chicken-soup-soul-literal-nourishment\" title=\"\">Chicken Soup for the Soul</a> self-help franchise, is one of the inspirations cited by people who have created what are now more usually called bucket lists. The phrase derives from \"kick the bucket\", a term for death, with unclear origins, but which quite likely relates to the bucket kicked away at a hanging. It was popularised by the 2007 film The Bucket List, in which characters played by Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman meet in a cancer ward, then race around the world, packing in experiences. As in that story, some people start these lists when diagnosed with incurable illnesses, and in those cases the goals often seem to have a deeper, much more personal flavour. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9565146/Dying-cancer-mans-bucket-list-with-a-twist.html\" title=\"\">On Tuesday, for instance, it was reported that former PR executive Simon Mitchell</a>, who has a cancer of the blood, has been pursuing a list that involves helping other people, using his professional contacts to set up meetings between seriously ill children and the stars they admire.</p> <p>But the trend goes much wider. Bill Clinton, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2005/jun/10/shopping.natashawalter?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Jane Fonda</a> and <a href=\"http://www.examiner.com/article/actress-cameron-diaz-bucks-hollywood-age-trend-i-can-t-wait-to-turn-40\" title=\"\">Cameron Diaz</a> have spoken of having a list. Last week, a man who had camped overnight for an iPhone 5 said that specific experience was included on his. And it was also reported that Megan Stammers, the 15-year-old girl thought to be in France with her maths teacher, had posted her own extensive list online. The last entry, fall in love, had been crossed off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397037510\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/9/26/1348680397077/Swimming-with-dolphins----010.jpg\" alt=\"Swimming with dolphins \u2026 something you want to do before it's too late?\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swimming with dolphins \u2026 something you want to do before it's too late? Photograph: Getty Images/Picture Press RM</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Picture Press RM</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are no end of websites for those wanting to compile and share their ambitions, with a whole industry having formed around the notion of cramming in eye-popping, hedonic experiences before you die: sky-diving, mountain climbing, throwing tomatoes at the Tomatina festival in Spain and meeting pop stars. On <a href=\"http://bucketlist.org\" title=\"\">bucketlist.org</a> someone proclaims their ambition to hold a baby white tiger; on <a href=\"http://bucketlist.net\" title=\"\">bucketlist.net</a> there are plans to fly in a hot-air balloon. A series of books lists the 1,001 films you should see, the 1,001 albums you should listen to, all the paintings and natural wonders you must catch, in order to be fulfilled before death. And while this approach can sound quite the opposite of fulfilment, an endless striving for satisfaction, that hasn't stopped people's wild enthusiasm.</p> <p>Are bucket lists really a good idea? It can be useful to have defined goals, of course, but the lists seem to encourage a strange blend of highly individualised behaviour and conformity, a situation in which everyone is hurtling, alone, towards similar goals. The psychotherapist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/philippa-perry?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Philippa Perry</a> suggests, laughingly, that they might actually have been started \"as a brilliant PR stunt by somebody who was selling swimming with dolphins\". There's a consumerist, acquisitive vibe to many of the lists, with the experience they replicate being the writing of a shopping list, says Perry. Instead of building on what you already have, \"to make a good life,\" she continues, \"it's really an attempt to fill an existential void\".</p> <p>There's also an innate air of competition to bucket lists, of striving to best yourself \u2013 but also others. In some ways it's no surprise that they have risen in popularity in an age when we are all encouraged to brand ourselves, to treat our Facebook pages as a shop window for our achievement-rich lives. Psychologist <a href=\"http://www.lindablair.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Linda Blair</a>, who is writing a book called The Key to Calm, to help people deal with stress and anxiety, says chasing big experiences is worthwhile if you enjoy the whole process. \"Saving up the money, planning it with friends, and then the moment as well. I'm all for that,\" she says. \"But if you're constantly living in the future, ignoring what's going on right now because you're shooting for goals, which happen so quickly that they're over, and then you have to chase another one, you're not really living.\"</p> <p>Could they be a useful way of dealing with the inevitability of death? Blair doesn't think so. \"It's a way of denying the idea of death, not coping with it at all ... People usually do this to ensure that there are things to look forward to, which means there are things that are still going to happen \u2026 My experience warns me that it's probably done in order to prevent thinking about death.\" Perry sees it as a way of dealing \"with how to pass the time. I think it's a way of trying to generate some excitement.</p> <p>\"What we should be doing in our bucket lists,\" Perry says, \"is learning how to be open with our own vulnerabilities so that we can form connections with other human beings \u2026 I think, for me, what's wrong with the bucket list is that it's individualistic \u2013 the idea of the isolated self goes very deep in Western society \u2013 and I think it's a red herring ... It's a distraction from the business of being human. We don't all like swimming with dolphins but we are all made to connect to each other. That's the really fun thing to do before you die.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Do you think bucket lists are a good idea, and if so what would be on yours?</p>",
  "<p>Police have condemned looters who raided a flooded cycle shop as \"despicable\" exceptions to community spirit in the aftermath of devastating damage to a suburb of Newcastle upon Tyne.</p> <p>A man and a woman have been arrested and nine bikes recovered after the overnight theft in Newburn of an estimated \u00a330,000 worth of stock in a street piled high with debris, abandoned cars and mud.</p> <p>Many areas remained on high alert, especially in North Yorkshire where Boroughbridge, Tadcaster and other communities beside rivers swollen by run-off from the Pennines were still at risk.</p> <p>The main bridges in Boroughbridge and Tadcaster have been closed, with water in the rivers Ure and Wharfe lapping the top of their arches. But residents in a nearby care home, including a 101-year-old, had their tea as usual while Environment Agency staff pumped out their cellar.</p> <p>New properties close to rivers have emerged again as an issue for flood control, along with concern at the very rapid build-up of flood water in urban areas. Although much of the north of England saw the heaviest September rain for 30 years, doubling the average for the month in many places, it was prolonged and steady for two days, rather than falling in the sudden torrents typical of extreme weather.</p> <p>The centre of low pressure responsible for the downpour has moved south but with much lower rainfall and most of the UK is expected to have quieter and dryer conditions before unsettled weather and potentially more rain returns, primarily to northern areas, next week. Heavily disrupted transport links between Scotland and the the Midlands have been largely restored, although the A1 Great North Road remained closed northbound for 40 miles through the Vale of York.</p> <p>The thefts from KB Cycles in Newburn have led to extra police patrols and Acting Ch Supt Dave Byrne of Northumbria police said: \"The safety of business owners and residents is paramount and it is despicable if people are thinking of taking advantage of the bad weather and using it as an opportunity to break in to properties. It is also important that people remember to take their own steps to ensure the security of their premises and belongings and make sure they lock doors and windows and use alarms where they have them.\"</p> <p>Pumps have been set up to rid shops and houses of up to six feet of water and temporary bridges have been built between dry islands in the main street, where water continued to gush from damaged culverts. Major clear-ups were also under way at Morpeth in Northumberland, where 40 houses were flooded for the second time in five years, Sunderland, Stockton on Tees, Durham and York \u2013 the last a city inured to flooding in the centre from its twin rivers the Ouse and Fosse.</p> <p>The latest drenching worked its way chronologically through the York Dungeon museum, according to general manager Helen Douglas who said: \"At 9am the water first appeared in the Viking area, then it spread into the torture chamber, the executions exhibit andthe witches space. By the time it reached the Dick Turpin exhibit, we had to stand and deliver the closed sign.\"</p> <p>Talks between the insurance industry and the government over future cover for properties in flood risk areas have been given further urgency by the latest damage.</p> <p>The Association of British Insurers said the latest bill had not yet been estimated but promised that members would \"be pulling out all the stops to help customers hit by bad weather\".</p> <p>There is growing concern at the lack of progress on a new agreement to provide cover for some 200,000 homes at serious flood risk when the current arrangements, agreed after widespread damage in 2008, end in June next year.</p> <p>The Environment Agency continued overnight work on clearing drains and watercourses and monitoring danger points, especially in North Yorkshire.</p> <p>More than 100 flood alerts and 57 flood warnings remained in force on Wednesday night, more than half of them in the north, while the total number of houses sent individual warnings by the Environment Agency since Sunday topped 105,000.</p>",
  "<p>The education secretary, Michael Gove, was personally warned last month about alleged child protection failures at the school attended by Megan Stammers, the 15-year-old who absconded with her 30-year-old teacher last Thursday.</p> <p>Gove was contacted by Lucy Duckworth, a former teacher and child protection campaigner, who was researching child safety policies at church schools overseen by the diocese of Chichester, including Bishop Bell school in Eastbourne, where Megan and the maths teacher Jeremy Forrest started a relationship before absconding on a cross-channel ferry to France.</p> <p>Sussex police said they had not found Megan and Forrest six days after they disappeared and were \"considering a number of hypotheses in conjunction with our European colleagues\" \u2013 Interpol and the French authorities \u2013 as a huge online appeal to trace Megan continued.</p> <p>The force declined to confirm or deny reports that the pair had been interviewed before they absconded or whether or not one or two of their mobile phones had been seized for analysis. Police said they became aware of the relationship last week, but would not say exactly when.</p> <p>Sky News reported a French prosecutor saying Forrest was not facing arrest as their disappearance is being treated as a missing persons inquiry.</p> <p>Singers from the girl group the Saturdays were among those who urged the 15-year-old to contact her family after a picture of her posing with the band member Frankie Sandford was published.</p> <p>Pupils and teachers posted appeals on the school's website for Megan to return. \"Dear Megan,\" read one from \"Mrs B\". \"We miss you so much in the lessons. It is not the same \u2026 too quiet. Come back soon.\"</p> <p>The headmaster, Terry Boatwright, has previously said the school and the local authority were \"addressing and investigating concerns that had been raised\" when the teacher and pupil fled. Reports suggested staff and pupils became aware that they may have been in a relationship as far back as February on a school trip to Los Angeles when they were seen together.</p> <p>Duckworth said she wrote to Gove about Bishop Bell school and how she \"was deeply concerned about the situation of child protection in the diocese of Chichester\" after receiving an unhelpful reply to her request for child protection information from Boatwright.</p> <p>\"The thrust [of the letter to Gove] was they knowingly allowed a man who had been accused of child abuse to continue working at the school and I said safeguarding of children was not being taken seriously enough,\" she said. She was referring to charges against Canon Gordon Rideout, who chaired the school's governing body until 2010, who is due in court next month charged with 38 child sex offences over 11 years from 1962.</p> <p>\"Schools have legal responsibilities for safeguarding the children in their care,\" a spokesman for the Department for Education said.</p> <p>\"We made this clear in our correspondence with Ms Duckworth.

And in particular, a stain on those who have failed to stand up to these atrocities and in some cases aided and abetted Assad's reign of terror.</p> <p>\"If the United Nations charter is to have any value in the 21st century we must now join together to support a rapid political transition. And at the same time no one of conscience can turn a deaf ear to the voices of suffering.\"</p> <p>The prime minister was not aiming his criticisms at the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, who warned on Tuesday that the security council's failure to act on Syria could lead to \"a regional calamity with global ramifications\".</p> <p>British officials said that on the diplomatic level the prime minister had in mind Russia and China, which have blocked attempts by Britain to agree tough UN security council resolutions condemning the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Tehran has a longstanding alliance with Assad while Britain recently stopped a Russian ship carrying helicopters to Syria by cancelling its insurance.</p> <p>The prime minister, who called for the removal of Assad, said that his defenders were wrong to blame the Arab spring for the bloodshed. \"Those who look at Syria today and blame the Arab spring have got it the wrong way round. You cannot blame the people for the behaviour of a brutal dictator. The responsibility lies with the dictator.\"</p> <p>He said people who invested great hope in the Arab spring were also wrong to give up even in light of the bloodshed in Syria and the political uncertainty after the election of Islamist leaders in countries such as Egypt. Libya showed the mixed picture, the prime minister said, as he condemned the murder of the US ambassador Chris Stephens in a \"despicable act of terrorism\" while hailing elections to a new congress.</p> <p>The prime minister said: \"One year on, some believe that the Arab spring is in danger of becoming an Arab winter. They point to the riots on the streets, Syria's descent into a bloody civil war, the frustration at the lack of economic progress and the emergence of newly elected Islamist-led governments across the region.</p> <p>\"But they are in danger of drawing the wrong conclusion. Today is not the time to turn back, but to keep the faith and redouble our support for open societies, and for people's demands for a job and a voice.\"</p> <p>Cameron won important support when Mohamed Morsi, the new Egyptian president, agreed with him on the need to step up pressure on China and Russia to secure a new UN security council resolution on Syria. In their first meeting Morsi told Cameron a new resolution should focus on sanctions, with the aim of isolating the Assad regime, because military action would worsen the crisis.</p> <p>Cameron, who held his first meeting in New York with Morsi, believes that the performance of the first elected leader of the world's largest Arab country shows the progress made in the Arab spring. Morsi upset Iran when he used an appearance at the non-aligned conference in Tehran to criticise Ahmadinejad for taking the wrong side in Syria.</p> <p>The prime minister used the example of Morsi to criticise former world leaders who wrongly tolerated dictators on the grounds that they guaranteed stability. \"The fact is that for decades, too many were prepared to tolerate dictators like Gaddafi and Assad on the basis that they would both keep their people safe at home and promote stability in the region and the wider world. In fact, neither was true. Not only were these dictators repressing their people, ruling by control not by consent, plundering the national wealth and denying people their basic rights and freedoms, they were funding terrorism overseas as well.\"</p> <p>Cameron did not name any former leaders. But Tony Blair embraced Muammar Gaddafi when he abandoned Libya's programme of weapons of mass destruction and was humiliated by Assad when he tried to reach out to Damascus in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.</p> <p>In a dig at Blair and George W Bush, who had hoped that removing Saddam Hussein would unleash a new democratic Iraq, Cameron said his own approach was not \"naive\". He said: \"I am not naive in believing that democracy alone has some magical healing power. I am a liberal Conservative, not a neoconservative.\"</p> <p>The prime minister's tough language on Syria reflects Britain's exasperation with China and Russia, which are using their vetoes as permanent members of the UN security council to block new resolutions. Britain believes there is no hope of Moscow and Beijing giving any ground at the moment.</p> <p>Officials talk of a \"logjam\" because the process launched by Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general, has failed. The prime minister believes there are two parallel processes under way in Syria \u2013 moves, led by the likes of Annan, to encourage a political transition at the top and a bloody revolution bubbling from below that will take some time to lead to a political transition at the top.</p> <p>Cameron would like the security council to agree to a new resolution under chapter seven of the UN charter, which authorises the use of force. This would provide legal authority for non-military intervention in Syria and could provide legal cover for military intervention at a later stage.</p> <p>The prime minister believes that, in the highly unlikely event of a new security council resolution, military action would be unrealistic. No-fly zones and safe zones would involve military force that could not be delivered.</p> <p>In his speech the prime minster announced that Britain was to provide \u00a33m for a Unicef fund to help 500,000 refugees in Syria, more than half of whom are children, as winter approaches.</p>",
  "<p>The British government is fighting to keep secret a blacklist of 44 countries with the worst immigration record whose nationals are targeted for tougher discriminatory action when applying to come to Britain.</p> <p>The Foreign Office has warned that some of the countries will be highly offended and regard their \"naming and shaming\" on a \"rogues' gallery\" list as a personal slight, and are likely to retaliate damaging Britain's diplomatic relations.</p> <p>They claim that retaliatory action could include restricting visas for British travellers, including officials, that could \"hinder our ability to function effectively overseas, damage business and reduce the projection of UK 'soft power'.\"</p> <p>The Home Office has launched a two-day appeal hearing starting on Thursday against a ruling by the information commissioner for a partial disclosure of the list. After a secret country-by-country assessment by the FCO, he said that publication would not damage relations in every case.</p> <p>His ruling came in response to a freedom of information campaign, by immigration detention activist, John O, who argued that keeping the list secret meant that those who faced discriminatory action by immigration officials could never know whether it was lawful or not.</p> <p>The list was drawn up in February last year after John Vine, the independent inspector of the UK Border Agency, revealed that British entry clearance officers based in Abu Dhabi and Islamabad were discriminating against Pakistani visa applicants compared to those from the Gulf states by demanding far more documentation from them, such as land registry title deeds. He said their action did not comply with equalities legislation.</p> <p>The Home Office responded by securing legal authorisation under equalities legislation to discriminate against nationalities the immigration authorities regard as \"high-risk\" and drawing up the list.</p> <p>The powers mean Border Force officers can demand more documents, such as bank statements, subject applicants to more rigorous questioning and their sponsors to interviews, when they apply for a visa or arrive at British airports. Those from countries on the list who are asked to leave Britain have their deportations given a higher priority.</p> <p>A Home Office statement to the information rights tribunal says that to get on the list, a country must have had more than 150 visa refusals or breaches of immigration law, with more than 50 of these for every 1,000 admissions in at least one of the preceding three months. A country can also be added to the list if there is specific intelligence that a significant number of its nationals have breached or about to breach the immigration rules.</p> <p>In practice there are actually two lists. The first contains the 44 countries whose nationals can expect much more rigorous treatment of their visa applications. The second list is of 32 countries whose nationals face tougher action when they arrive in Britain and if they face deportation. They are updated quarterly and signed off by the immigration minister.</p> <p>It is thought that the core of the lists probably centres on countries from the Indian sub-continent, such as Pakistan, and the Middle East.</p> <p>The FCO's director of migration, Susan Simon, has told the tribunal that \"although many countries will be aware of the security concerns posed by their nationals, some would be highly offended if the UK raised these concerns publicly. Many countries use visa and immigration policy as a foreign policy tool, reflecting their attitudes towards certain countries and the value of certain relationships. They expect us to do the same.\"</p> <p>She said that even those that understood Britain's risk-based approach would react badly if it was publicised that they were on the list. She expected that the published list would attract widespread attention and feature in the international media.</p> <p>The move would lead to retaliation such as similar measures to British travellers applying for visas, including officials, which could hinder the UK's ability to function effectively overseas.</p> <p>Simon also warns that it risks diplomatic countermeasures and could become a bone of contention in diplomatic talks on top of the regular concerns they already raise with British ambassadors and ministers over visas as they lobby to be taken off the list.</p> <p>She admits that the government was taken by surprise by the commissioner's ruling that there should ban partial disclosure of the list arguing that it could be \"reversed engineered\" to identify the countries that remained secret.</p> <p>She also said that those who were publicly identified as part of a smaller blacklist or rogues' gallery of countries who have been named and shamed on the basis of poor relations with the UK would lead to presentational and reputation ramifications.</p> <p>The FCO also claimed it would also risk overseas contracts for British companies and would \"create or increase the perception that the UK is not open to visitors or business from those countries.\" Co-operation over deporting their nationals from Britain would also be put at risk.</p> <p>Human rights lawyer, Shahram Taghavi, who is representing John O in Thursday's appeal, said the authorisation and the secret list \"not only offends against the established fundamental human rights principle of not discriminating on the grounds of nationality or race, but also violates a cardinal principle of the rule of law, the principle that laws must be accessible to citizens.</p> <p>\"We will be arguing that the Home Office have not provided a single piece of evidence to support their allegation that disclosure of the list will damage international relations and inviting the tribunal to rule that, in any event, any risk of damage to international relations is wholly outweighed by the public interest of knowing which countries are on the list.\"</p> <p>He added that while it was possible to argue that the countries involved probably already knew they were on such a list, it missed the point: \"Our primary concern is for the innocent citizens of these countries who are unknowingly being discriminated against solely on the grounds of their nationality or race.\"</p> <p>A government spokesperson defended the decision to keep the list secret: \"The ability to more closely examine those who pose the highest risk is vital to ensuring the security of the border. We are appealing as we believe that maintaining the list's confidentiality is vital to ensure officers can undertake these thorough checks without compromising diplomatic relations.\"</p> <p>They also denied the claim that it would make it harder for an individual to launch a discrimination claim in court..</p> <p>\"We expect our officers to treat individuals professionally regardless of their nationality and we take any allegation of discrimination seriously,\" they said. \"The ability to differentiate between the risk posed by particular nationalities does not permit individual decisions to be made solely on the basis of a person's nationality.\"</p>",
  "<p>As work crews on Wednesday cleared the debris left behind by violent clashes between police and protesters outside las Cortes, the parliament building in Madrid, Spain's long-running crisis had definitively spilled beyond everyday politics and economics.</p> <p>Tuesday night's violence reflected a first radicalisation of protest in a country whose peaceful and plentiful indignados were the inspiration for Occupy movements from Wall Street to the City of London. Key indignado groups, indeed, had refused to back the demonstration.</p> <p>But the violence, which saw 64 people injured, also showed a hardening of government policy towards protest since the election of a conservative, reformist party headed by prime minister Mariano Rajoy at the end of last year.</p> <p>Even before the march, government officials had loudly claimed that protesters were troublemakers from both the left and the right.</p> <p>Perhaps that is why riot police felt they could hide their identity badges \u2013 a move that protesters say proves they feel themselves to be above the law. A startling example of police culture came in a tweet from Jos\u00e9 Manuel S\u00e1nchez of the Unified Police Union (SUP). \"We support them not wearing badges for violent demonstrators,\" he said during the demonstration. \"Give it to them hard.\" Television pictures of baton charges and rubber bullets suggest they did exactly that.</p> <p>Organisers had said the attempt to ring the parliament building would be peaceful, but they also clearly expected arrests. Authorities said on Wednesday they had found 260kg of rocks that had been hurled at police \u2013 not indignado behaviour.</p> <p>Opposition politicians warned the protest could not be ignored. \"The country is slipping out of the government's hands,\" the socialist opposition leader Alfredo P\u00e9rez Rubalcaba said. \"After yesterday's demonstration it would be a mistake for politicians to talk only about public order.\"</p> <p>But while events in Madrid caught headlines, the settlement between Spaniards that has allowed them to enjoy almost four decades of democracy since the 1975 death of dictator General Francisco Franco was crumbling in a more serious fashion elsewhere.</p> <p>In Barcelona it was legislators, not demonstrators, who were challenging the post-Franco settlement. Artur Mas, leader of the Catalan regional government called early elections for 25 November as politicians of all colours adapted to a game-changing demonstration for independence that brought hundreds of thousands of Catalans onto the city's streets earlier this month.</p> <p>Mas has called for Catalonia to have its own state. The upcoming elections will be seen as a plebiscite on that, however much his nationalist Convergence and Union coalition wraps itself in euphemisms and refuses to actually use the word \"independence\". Once let out of its cage, the independence tiger may now prove impossible to put back \u2013 with polls showing a slim majority now in favour.</p> <p>A sign of how serious the debate is was the reappearance of Spanish monarch King Juan Carlos in the political terrain. The man widely seen as the chief facilitator of modern Spanish democracy warned Catalan separatists against chasing \"chimeras\".</p> <p>Angry voices on the far right make more frightening noises, reminding Spaniards that the constitution calls on the army to protect the integrity of Spain \u2013 and recalling a 1934 state of war declared by the republican government after a previous sovereignty grab by Catalans.</p> <p>Rajoy, meanwhile, has to worry about Spain's recession-hit economy as it struggles with 25% unemployment. Further deterioration, worsened by government spending cuts, will see the economy shrink 3% over two years. But Spain's deficit, of nearly 9% last year, needs to be reduced as borrowing eats up ever-larger parts of the budget.</p> <p>On Thursday his government will present yet another austerity budget, this time for 2013, together with a reform package designed to prepare Spain for a probable bailout by fellow eurozone countries. On Friday a report will reveal the size of the hole blown in Spain's banks by a housing bubble which left them awash with toxic real estate loans.</p> <p>As the interest rates that markets demand for lending Spain money jumped again on Wednesday, perhaps egged on by Tuesday's violence, a bailout looked ever more necessary.</p> <p>While Rajoy is expected to turn to Europe for help, Catalan nationalists also want Europe to ease them into a new relationship with Spain that could include anything from full independence within the European Union to a new federal or bilateral arrangement.</p> <p>The basic shape of modern Spain is being questioned just as membership of the euro prevents the country sorting out its problems alone. Yet Spaniards of all kinds, including Catalans, see Europe as their saviour.</p> <p>EU leaders may want to take that into account when deciding how harsh bailout conditions must be for the continent's most ardently euro-enthusiastic country.</p>",
  "<p>When Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto was a candidate in Mexico's presidential elections, allegations that he had benefited from favourable media coverage triggered mass student demonstrations against him and his party. When he won the 1 July election, those allegations formed part of a legal challenge to his victory.</p> <p>Now, as the young and telegenic president-elect from the Institutional Revolutionary party, or PRI, prepares to take charge of the country on 1 December, the media allegations have been deemed legally irrelevant \u2013 and the furore they once caused has all but died away.</p> <p>The runner-up, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, and his party of Democratic Revolution, or PRD, were unable to persuade Mexico's federal electoral tribunal that there had been unfair favourable coverage of Pe\u00f1a Nieto, alongside other allegations such as massive vote buying and dubious campaign funding, such as to violate constitutional guarantees that elections be \"authentic and fair\".</p> <p>The part of the tribunal's unanimous decision on 30 August that referred to media bias drew heavily on an earlier decision by the Federal Electoral Institute, or IFE. That decision threw out a specific PRD complaint about \"hidden publicity\" by Pe\u00f1a Nieto, particularly on TV channels and other outlets associated with the broadcasting giant Televisa.</p> <p>\"They were unable to demonstrate that the role of Televisa was illegal,\" said the media expert Raul Trejo. \"The case is closed. Some people might question the [legal] rules, but these are the rules we have.\"</p> <p>Only one of the nine members of the IFE general council, which considered the \"hidden publicity\" complaint in a publicly broadcast debate on 16 August, voted against a \"proposal\" put before it by the institution's investigative branch.</p> <p>The proposal rubbished the quality of the evidence submitted by the PRD, which relied heavily on journalistic accounts of the alleged bias, among them an article published in the Guardian on 7 June.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/07/mexico-presidency-tv-dirty-tricks\" title=\"\">The article</a> was based on a cache of documents dated from 2005 appearing to show promotional packages, including coverage on Televisa, drawn up for political clients, including Pe\u00f1a Nieto when he was just taking over as governor of the state of Mexico. Televisa has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/08/documents-no-proof-tv-dirty-tricks-mexico?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">challenged</a> the authenticity of these documents, and has denied it sold favourable news coverage to politicians including Pe\u00f1a Nieto.</p> <p>The full IFE proposal described the Guardian article as \"a subjective evaluation that is based on events than cannot be verified\". However, the debate in the IFE general council on 16 August automatically ruled out consideration of this and other evidence presented by the PRD that referred to alleged misconduct prior to 2007/8 legal reforms that drastically tightened restrictions on TV and radio advertising.</p> <p>It also dismissed the relevance of events already considered in previous rulings, such as a 2011 case in which the electoral authorities had sanctioned both Televisa and Mexico's other national network, TV Azteca, for transmitting political advertisements promoting governor Pe\u00f1a Nieto around the country. The law says such advertisements should only be broadcast locally.</p> <p>The most eye-catching allegation admitted for consideration was that the Pe\u00f1a Nieto campaign had paid for an interview in April on a radio show presented by a celebrity journalist, which was deemed groundless.</p> <p>Most of the debate in the IFE general council, however, focused on the question of whether the investigation into the evidence presented by the PRD had gone far enough. Alfredo Figueroa, the only member to vote against the proposal, argued that it had been superficial. He said it should have included more in-depth probing, including a requirement that prominent news anchors answer questions derived from the allegations.</p> <p>Another council member, Lorenzo Cordova, partially backed this position. He qualified his vote in favour of the proposal by stating that a \"richer investigation\" might have produced a different result.</p> <p>The overwhelming majority view, however, insisted that there was nothing in the complaint to justify \"additional irritation\" to journalists and media outlets featured in the evidence. A more exhaustive investigation, several of the council members said, would have violated guarantees of freedom of expression.</p> <p>\"The way that the alleged damages was argued, their relationship with events, and the temporality in which they occurred, led the investigation into a wall in all cases,\" the council member Benito Nacif said. \"It was unnecessary to continue.\"</p> <p>Both the IFE's decision, and the tribunal's subsequent wholesale dismissal of all other allegations of unfair play in the elections, sparked sharp criticism from some commentators as well as student protests. But the marches have since dwindled, as the movement appears to be running out of steam, and attention has refocused on what a Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration will actually look like, rather than how he is portrayed.</p> <p>The media expert Trejo nevertheless insists that while the controversy over the alleged bias may have waned, it has left a legacy of concern about the ethical nature of the relationship between the media and politicians in general. At the height of the post-election conflict Pe\u00f1a Nieto said that setting up an independent body to keep an eye on publicity spending at all levels of government was one of his priorities. \"This issue,\" Trejo said, \"is here to stay\".</p> <p>In its recent final review of this year's presidential election, IFE concluded that Televisa's news coverage on its nationwide newscasts had been fairly divided between the three main presidential candidates, stating that by the close of campaigning each of them had received just over 42 hours of coverage.</p>",
  "<p>Market jitters over Europe's debt crisis returned after weeks of relative calm on Wednesday amid a welter of grim statistics from some of the biggest European economies, mixed signals from bickering eurozone political leaders, and mass protests against austerity in southern Europe.</p> <p>As unrest gripped Greece, Spain, and Portugal, Madrid's borrowing costs surged through the 6% threshold after the leading eurozone creditors made it plain that a planned \u20ac100bn (\u00a380bn) bailout for Spanish banks would saddle the country with higher debt levels.</p> <p>The lack of political will to fix the crisis was reinforced by the European commission flatly contradicting the governments of Germany, the Netherlands and Finland after they walked away from pledges delivered at an EU summit in June.</p> <p>The grimmer mood enveloping the eurozone was also underlined by figures from France putting the jobless rate at more than 3 million for the first time in 13 years and by falling retail sales reported from recession-hit Italy. Stock markets fell across Europe with the FTSE 100 down 1.5%, while the German Dax and French Cac 40 were down 2% and 2.8%. The surge in French unemployment will complicate President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's hopes of beginning to tackle France's economic malaise. The increased expenditure on benefits and the fall in tax receipts will also make it harder for France to meet the EU-prescribed budget deficit target of 3% by next year.</p> <p>Hollande came to power in May on a campaign of resisting German-led austerity. He now needs to plunge France into austerity \u2014 though he does not use that term \u2014 to make savings of \u20ac30bn through spending cuts and tax rises. Details will become clearer on Friday when his government's first budget, for next year, goes to cabinet.</p> <p>Mired in a deepening recession, with the economy projected to shrink by at least 2.4% this year, Italy also posted more bad news, with retail sales figures for July showing a 3.2% fall on a year ago.</p> <p>But as Madrid's cost of borrowing shot up, Spain's predicament \u2014 coupled with the widening eurozone splits over how to respond \u2014 was the biggest factor unnerving the markets. While the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, appears condemned eventually to having to request a humiliating bailout which, according to German finance ministry estimates, could amount to \u20ac300bn, he continues to play for time.</p> <p>The eurozone is divided over how to respond. Hollande and the Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, are pressing Rajoy to request a bailout. Berlin is encouraging him to play for time. Chancellor Angela Merkel is moving into an election year and is reluctant to return to parliament in Berlin to argue for another unpopular eurozone rescue programme.</p> <p>The split between Berlin and Paris over Spain reflects much broader and fundamental divisions over policies dealing with the sovereign debt crisis. Two big policy shifts in recent months brought a respite in the crisis, giving leaders time to come up with more substantive action.</p> <p>In June, an EU summit declared that policy had to be aimed at breaking the vicious circle linking vulnerable banks and weak sovereigns in a downward spiral of bigger debt. To that end, they decided to use the eurozone's bailout funds to recapitalise weak banks directly without adding the loans to a state's debt.</p> <p>The second big move was from the European Central Bank which earlier this month announced a new policy of unlimited intervention in the markets to buy up shaky government bonds. The June consensus on lending directly to weak banks was always fragile, but collapsed on Tuesday when the eurozone's key triple-A rated creditors, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland, issued a surprise statement declaring the bailout funds could recapitalise banks directly only as a last resort, that the policy was a longer-term option, and could not be applied to pre-existing or \"legacy\" bailouts, namely Spain and Ireland who had their hopes pinned on the June breakthrough. Direct bank recapitalisation has been effectively frozen before it even began.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the European commission stemmed the shift from the three countries, insisting policy agreed in June had to be implemented promptly. \"Our position regarding breaking the vicious circle between the banks and the sovereign is very clear \u2026 This should be done quickly\" said EC spokesman Olivier Bailly.</p> <p>In agreeing to the direct bank loans in June, Berlin demanded that first there needed to a new regime based at the ECB for supervising eurozone banks. The commission drafted the complex legislation in less than three months, unveiling it a fortnight ago. Berlin is now dragging its feet, delaying the new regime while insisting it should not police the vast majority of German banks.</p> <p>In sharp contrast, France's Europe minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said this week in Brussels that the new bank supervisory regime had to be created as a matter of urgency.</p>",
  "<p>In the <a href=\"http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/LAN/Harpurhey/ManchesterGeneral.shtml\">General Cemetery</a> in Harpurhey, among the dead of 19th century Manchester, lies a man who gave his life in the service of the city.</p> <p>Exactly 145 years to the day before the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/sep/18/woman-police-officer-killed-manchester\">tragic deaths</a> of PCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes, Sergeant Charles Brett became the first Manchester police officer to be killed on duty. It was an event that was just as shocking in its time as the shooting in Mottram.</p> <p>On 18 September 1867, Brett was helping to transport a group of prisoners from court to Belle Vue jail. Among them were two leaders of the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/easterrising/profiles/po17.shtml\">Irish Republican Brotherhood</a>, Thomas Kelly and Timothy Deasy, both violently opposed to British rule in Ireland.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396741283\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/26/1348678969643/grave.jpg\" alt=\"charles brett\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Broken but the inscription is still clear.

Kelly and Deasy were sprung to freedom, and Brett was shot dead. According to most accounts, the fatal bullet hit Brett after passing through the van\u2019s keyhole as the mob forced the door.</p> <p>Duncan Broady, Curator of the <a href=\"http://www.manchester.gov.uk/info/200070/museums_and_galleries/2998/greater_manchester_police_museum/1\">Greater Manchester Police Museum</a>, believes the ambush caught police and public alike by surprise:</p> <blockquote> <p>It was a sudden outbreak of extreme violence using firearms. Although the two Fenians being rescued were suspected of being involved in some sort of activities, there was very little preparation done to provide a special escort. The normal sort of prisoners were being taken through to the prison at the same time.</p> </blockquote> <p>The controversy about who fired the fatal shot has never been fully resolved, but the following day\u2019s <em>Manchester Guardian</em> was in little doubt:</p> <blockquote> <p>A young man, named William O\u2019Mora alias Allen of Sudell Street, Oldham Road, who, it is stated, shot Brett, was keenly pursued... At length he was overpowered by some civilians in a brickcroft near the Ashton New Road, was knocked down and treated with considerable violence, and was only given up alive at the intercession of the police.</p> </blockquote> <p>The deaths of PCs Bone and Hughes prompted <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/sep/20/manchester-police-shootings-families-tribute\">tributes to them</a> from<br>across society, and so it was in 1867 too. The first court hearing<br>began with a tribute to Brett from Fowler, the presiding magistrate,<br>as reported by the <em>Manchester Guardian</em> of 20 September:</p> <blockquote> <p>For many years an officer of that dock, he has performed most difficult duties with admirable temper, firmness and credit to himself, and he carries with him to his last resting place the universal respect of all with whom he has been associated.</p> </blockquote> <p>Kelly and Deasy were never recaptured and escaped to America. But Allen, Michael Larkin and Michael O\u2019Brien were found guilty of Brett\u2019s murder and were hanged two months later outside New Bailey gaol in Salford. It was the last public execution to take place in the Manchester area and a crowd of thousands, many from the local Irish community and sympathetic to the Republican cause, attended.</p> <p>The three are still known as the \u2018Manchester Martyrs\u2019, and memorials exist both in Manchester and in several towns in Ireland. But, says Duncan Broady, Brett has been less well remembered, at least once the initial shock of his death faded:</p> <blockquote> <p>The funeral was particularly elaborate. Various subscriptions were made, and a tablet to him is still in St Anne\u2019s Church in Manchester. But there wasn\u2019t any plaque erected within a police station. It was still too early. That sort of thing only happens after the world wars when we start to see memorials to fallen soldiers.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sergeant Brett\u2019s gravestone has toppled over, and lies cracked and difficult to find. Even with a map, it took me 20 minutes to spot it amid all the similar stones.

  "<p>Debut ready-to-wear collections by Hedi Slimane for Saint Laurent and Raf Simons for Christian Dior will dominate the new season in Paris where the final leg of fashion week began on Wednesday.</p> <p>This is regardless of what fashion cards Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel and Marc Jacobs for Louis Vuitton play when they unveil their designs for next season.</p> <p>Industry insiders say Slimane and Simons, working at two of the most formidable houses, are likely to usher in a new era of fashion.</p> <p>Simons made his mark with a well received haute couture show in July. Some of these designs made it onto the red carpet when Marion Cotillard wore a grey tweed strapless pencil dress at the Toronto film festival while at the Emmys Julianne Moore chose a canary yellow, long sleeved gown. But so far, the only indication of the new Saint Laurent direction has been an image of Gwyneth Paltrow carrying a leather bag, dubbed the Duffle.</p> <p>Both designers started out in menswear with minimalist tendencies and a youthful spirit. But Simons has form in womenswear. During his recent tenure at Jil Sander, he took his clean aesthetic and imbued it with a gloriously modern femininity. He also created talking-point pieces for the catwalk. In an era of fashion blogging and immediate gratification, Simons' shopper bags, inspired by supermarket carrier bags, and netted beanie hats for Sander, were endlessly photographed and written about. It is a trick he may replicate at Dior.</p> <p>Slimane has not been under the catwalk glare since he bowed out at Dior Homme in 2007 after creating an influential formula of skinny tailoring with a rock 'n' roll edge.</p> <p>The designer does have a previous attachment to the house of YSL. He worked in the menswear studio between 1997 and 2000, and the late Saint Laurent himself attended Slimane's Dior Homme debut. In a recent interview with Paris Vogue, he said he wanted to evoke the late designer \"without ever quoting him, at least not directly\".</p> <p>Clues to his plans for the label are mounting. Slimane accepted the role under the proviso he could perform an overhaul. A new typeface emerged in July while last week in Shanghai, a refitted store was revealed. An introductory black and white ad campaign, shot by Slimane, a successful fashion photographer in his own right, depicts a topless tattooed male model with a women's high-heel clad foot resting on it. These images suggest the designer is planning to toy with Parisian sexiness plus a dash of rock 'n' roll for his debut on Monday.</p> <p>Belgian designer Dries Van Noten might not radically change the gear of fashion but he is a designer with a loyal following. Both Selfridges and Liberty report the brand is doing swift trade on the shopfloor.</p> <p>Once again Van Noten produced clothes that looked effortless, wearable and modern. Shown in an industrial space with concrete floors and white wrought iron pillars, the first model <strong><em>(seen left) </em></strong>wore a sheer check shirt layered over a white vest with a below-the-knee skirt heavily embellished with 3D flowers that looked like rosettes. The outfit was finished with a pair of white frame sunglasses that brought to mind Kurt Cobain.</p> <p>Outfits had a cool, slouchy feel that hinted at 1990s grunge without ever seeping into overkill. A gorgeous silkscreen poppy print skirt, for example, was matched with a plaid shirt. Dreamy chiffons were worn over trousers. A shimmer of metallic ran through some outfits while chunky silver chain necklaces finished off others. A Superstar version of The Carpenter's hit Close to You fuzzed on the soundtrack.</p> <p>\"Contrasts,\" said Van Noten backstage. \"Menswear with womenswear but more spontaneous this time, a more thrown together approach.\" Lucien Freud was named as an inspiration for the colour palette while he confirmed there was a deliberate grunge factor to the show. \"A pyjama jacket perhaps instead of a shirt, the Sonic Youth soundtrack,\" he said.</p>",
  "<h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/andrew-gimson\" title=\"\">Andrew Gimson</a>: 'Clegg appeared to be addressing a nursery school'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396738628\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/11/1342014676683/Andrew-Gimson.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Gimson\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The sonorous vacuities of conference rhetoric come easily to Nick Clegg. He can intone as well as the next man that \"there is no silver bullet\" and \"all parties will have to acknowledge the need for further belt-tightening\".</p> <p>One felt, however, that Clegg had missed a chance to do something better and more serious. His courage in adversity is admirable, but does not include the intellectual courage to talk to an educated audience in the way he would talk to his educated friends. There were instead quite long passages when Clegg seemed under the impression that he was addressing a nursery school: \"Going green means going forward\u2026 To make blue go green you have to add yellow.\" The Lib Dems applauded this for so long that Clegg felt moved to remark: \"I thought you'd groan rather than clap that one \u2013 what a generous audience!\"</p> <p>Earlier this week Boris Johnson praised Nick Clegg for being able to speak \"several foreign languages \u2026 including Dutch.\" Clegg made quite a good joke about this, saying of Johnson: \"Well at least he's found one party leader he's prepared to endorse in public.\"</p> <p>But Clegg betrayed no sign of linguistic ambition even in English. He kept his speech short and bland. It was more of a holding operation than a fightback.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Gimson is the author of Boris \u2013 the Rise of Boris Johnson</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/vicky-pryce\" title=\"\">Vicky Pryce</a>: 'he's staking his reputation on the economy'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396738629\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/12/2/1322848791637/Vicky_Pryce.jpg\" alt=\"Vicky Pryce\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Clegg had to reassure voters and activists that the Lib Dems have a plan to get the economy moving again in the short to medium term \u2013 or, at the very least, in time for the next election. All the Lib Dems' gains on the green agenda, income tax thresholds, the NHS or limiting welfare cuts will pale into insignificance if the Lib Dems are seen to have presided over a serious reduction in incomes and living standards with no discernible benefit in sight.</p> <p>At least there are signs that it is now accepted that the government needs to stimulate the economy. The conference voted overwhelmingly not to abandon the fiscal discipline, but it also warmed hugely to Cable's call for the urgent need for extra demand. Hence the emphasis in Clegg's speech of being ready to boost the economy \"again and again and again\". There seems to have finally been an acceptance that it is a good idea to use the government's balance sheet to support extra lending to small and medium-sized enterprises and kickstart housing and big infrastructure projects. Is it enough? Truth is that many of the new Lib Dem proposals for a fairer tax system \u2013 such as a mansion tax or the attack on safe havens \u2013 will raise very little and will not reduce the need for further welfare cuts later on in this parliament.</p> <p>The Lib Dems will be able to differentiate themselves if they make the case for what must eventually happen: further public sector borrowing at cheap rates to allow major infrastructure spending that is needed to push the economy forward. As Nick Clegg said: \"If we secure our country's future we will secure our own\". But if the economy flops, the Lib Dems will be the big losers. I am not sure he or the party have realised how big.</p> <p>\u2022 Vicky Pryce is an economist</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tomclark\" title=\"\">Tom Clark</a>: 'it's hard to believe he will be courting anyone's vote in 2015'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396738630\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/10/03/tom_clark_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Clark\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I understand that it is Nick Clegg's habit to finalise his big speech on his way to conference, and then leave it well alone. In general I admire the self-discipline, rare among leaders who are mostly up late the night before their day on the stage, tinkering into the small hours. This year, however, it really would have been smarter to take some account of the downbeat week that was.</p> <p>Clegg appeared arrogant by failing even to mention Tuesday's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/sep/25/secret-courts-lib-dem-conference\" title=\"\">crushing vote against</a> his desire to compromise with the Conservatives on secret courts. He also appeared weirdly aloft. After multiple <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/sep/24/labour-lead-tories-icm-poll?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">polls</a> this week suggested that the party would fare materially better under Vince Cable, he failed to show a creative response to Vince Cable's intriguing declaration of \"<a href=\"http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2012/09/24/vince-cable-conference-speech-in-full?link=related\" title=\"\">social democratic values</a>\" on Monday.</p> <p>Instead, the troops were served with a dogged defence of the coalition's failing economic policy, lightened only by a sprinkling of words about aspiration and opportunity, language which has been ubiquitous as it has been impotent since the time of Tony Blair.</p> <p>You can, I suppose, admire the integrity of a centrist politician who <a href=\"http://www.birminghampost.net/news/west-midlands-news/2012/09/26/nick-clegg-tells-critics-if-you-don-t-like-me-vote-labour-65233-31908938/\" title=\"\">preceded his speech with a briefing</a> about how he would rather go without votes from disgruntled leftwingers. But it is increasingly hard to believe that he will be tasked with courting anyone's vote in 2015.

(I emulate the annoying habit of party leaders by forgetting to use verbs). Nick Clegg's message to his faithful was: stay the course and rely on the economy to get the country and the Liberal Democrats out of their predicament. At this stage of the political cycle \u2013 too far in with the Conservatives and too far out to start bidding with Tories and Labour for the next coalition \u2013 this was probably as far as Clegg wanted to go.</p> <p>Clegg has fallen back on the experience of Paddy Ashdown, now sensibly chosen as his righthand man for 2015. Yet one other figure from the past loomed large, if unspoken. In mocking Liam Fox and Ed Balls in equal measure, labelling them both as on the extreme, Clegg was emulating Tony Blair and his strategy of triangulation. Take two opposites and plonk yourself in the middle. Blair's approach worked wonders initially, but it soon led to public distrust.</p> <p>What Clegg needed to do this time was to say: \"this is where I stand. These are the values I espouse, whether or not you agree with them. They are neither left, right nor middle. They are distinctive\". This is his urgent task for the next 12 months. By next autumn, with all parties looking directly ahead at the general election, the success or failure of economic plan A, A minus or A plus will be much clearer. Clegg's future will be much clearer too.</p> <p>\u2022 John Kampfner is a former chief executive of Index on Censorship</p>",
  "<p>This week, as the death toll in Syria's civil war approached 25,000, heads of state gathered at the United Nations in New York to proclaim their \"solemn commitment \u2026 to an international order based on the rule of law.\" The big shindig \u2013 or, in UN speak, the \"<a href=\"http://www.unrol.org/article.aspx?article_id=168\" title=\"\">High Level Meeting on the Rule of Law at the National and International Levels</a>\" \u2013 was an opportunity to advance human dignity, lay a foundation for economic development, and repair the social contract between peoples and governments which has been tattered across broad swaths of the globe.</p> <p>But in the end, world leaders fell short. After more than a year of planning, all they could muster was another day of talk. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jan/27/united-nations-rule-of-law\" title=\"\">It did not have to be this way</a>.</p> <p>Back in March, Ban Ki-moon had proposed much more. The UN secretary general courageously declared that states should commit themselves to an ambitious program of action containing detailed recommendations for enhancing international dispute resolution, empowering women and children, strengthening housing and property rights, and protecting victims of war crimes.</p> <p>The secretary general called for clear goals, with benchmarks to measure progress, and an ongoing consultative forum \u2013 with full participation by civil society, the private sector and others \u2013 to check, sustain and bolster states' political will over time.</p> <p>In short, the initial vision for the meeting offered the prospect of genuine, concrete action that might begin to constrain the exercise of arbitrary power. Which may be precisely why it provoked fierce opposition from political leaders determined not to shed an ounce of sovereignty \u2013 whether in the security council or on national territory.</p> <p>Even as the dynamics of global power shift in the first decades of the 21st century, political inequalities and rivalries left a gap too wide to bridge. The lowest common denominator prevailed. There was no consensus on what the rule of law means, let alone how to promote it. The final declaration skirted the issue. Unable to agree on much else, states simply asked the secretary to \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 write another report.</p> <p>What a come down.</p> <p>And yet, notwithstanding how far the high level meeting fell from the secretary general's grand aspirations, the final declaration did contain a few positive notes.</p> <p>It helpfully \"recognise[d] the role of the international criminal court\" in ending impunity, called upon states not yet parties to consider ratifying the court's Rome Statute, and \"emphasise[d] the importance of cooperation with the court,\" as well as of fortifying domestic mechanisms for investigating and trying bringing perpetrators of grave crimes. It acknowledged the possibility of \"voluntary pledges\" by individual states \u2013 and more than 140 such promises were registered, albeit with no formal means of monitoring or follow-up. And, perhaps most importantly, the declaration suggested that the rule of law has a role to play in the post-2015 international development agenda.</p> <p>That matters, because the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \u2013 specific targets to which states committed more than a decade ago to do things like halve poverty and achieve universal primary education \u2013 are up for renewal in 2015.</p> <p>This very week, even as the rule of law summit disappointed, the secretary general's high level panel on the post-2015 development agenda \u2014 co-chaired by prime minister David Cameron of the UK, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia and President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia \u2014 convenes for the first time. A big question is whether the next generation of MDGs will embrace the values of human rights, equity and political as well as economic freedom \u2013 all of which 189 states subscribed to in the UN Millennium Declaration of 2000.</p> <p>As the debate over the rule of law these past months has revealed, these values are far more sensitive and, to some, more threatening than what often seem the more \"technical\" matters of how many kids go to school, eat properly and enjoy access to health care.</p> <p>And yet, as an accumulating body of evidence makes clear, you can't have one set of public goods without the other. Good governance, human rights, and minority protections are essential preconditions for sustainable development. Health, education and human security will be more widely achieved and shared only when people have the knowledge and tools to hold government and private institutions to account.</p> <p>And, as the tremors of change resonating throughout the Arab world show, the rule of law is both valued, and valuable, in its own right.</p> <p>After the assembled presidents and prime ministers leave New York later this month, the challenge of infusing justice into the next generation of MDGs will be their next major test. Can they summon more foresight for this task than they managed in supporting the rule of law?</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron and Andrew Mitchell have been staring deeply into each other's eyes. The prime minister says he is convinced that&#xa0;his chief whip did not call the police \"fucking plebs\" in a&#xa0;foul-mouthed rant over a bicycle last week. What makes the Conservative leader so sure? Mitchell apparently <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/9567116/David-Cameron-warns-Andrew-Mitchell-rant-must-never-happen-again.html\" title=\"\">\"looked him in the eye\"</a>, while assuring him of his innocence.</p> <p>But are our eyes really such clear indicators of what we are thinking? \"There is this idea that if someone maintains eye contact with you, they are telling you the&#xa0;truth,\" says psychologist Richard Wiseman, a professor at Hertfordshire University. \"There is no basis for that. If anything that is what liars tend to do, because eye movements are fairly easy to control, so they will do the exact opposite of what you expect them to do. So if that is the only signal he [Cameron] had, it wouldn't be a reliable one.\"</p> <p>Body language expert <a href=\"http://www.judijames.com/\" title=\"\">Judi James</a>, meanwhile, says body-language clues are \"never precise enough to give you the kind of result you can completely act on\". For a start, she points out, there is the \"Othello error\", named after the Shakespeare character who accused his wife of adultery and then read her shock as guilt. \"The minute I see a security guard looking at me in Boots, I look like the Artful Dodger,\" she says, \"because I am trying to look as innocent as I am.\"</p> <p>Then there is the fact that politicians are \"self-monitors\" \u2013 people who are conscious of the image they project, who tend to be better liars, says Wiseman. A&#xa0;better way to discern untruths, Wiseman feels, is to listen to the person's voice and words. \"People tend to say less and use more 'ums and ahhs'. They don't tend to refer to themselves as much. But there is no way to tell if someone is definitely lying.\"</p> <p>And Cameron's confidence in his ability to read body language, sounds worrying, says James. \"I&#xa0;wouldn't mind giving him some coaching, to warn him not to do that in the future. Because if he is taking those skills out into world conferences and financial meetings, I want to go with him to tug on his sleeve every so often and remind him.\"</p>",
  "<p>America's unions, having been pummeled by a succession of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/mar/29/us-unions-ohio\">anti-union laws</a>, lost <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/27/caterpillar-strike-open-season-unions\">strikes</a> and <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/06/wisconsin-recall-election-ominous-crucible-us-politics\">failed recall elections</a> in the past year, must feel some satisfaction from the sudden, belated outpouring of public support for labor rights coming from across the country and the political spectrum. All it took was for<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/25/seattle-seahawks-green-bay-packers-replacement-officials\"> the Green Bay Packers to lose a football game</a>.</p> <p>That was on Monday, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/25/nfl-statement-replacement-referees-packers-seahawks\">a blown call handed an undeserved victory to the Seattle Seahawks</a>, and the whole state of Wisconsin exploded. The source of the less-than-competent officiating was the undertrained replacement referees\u2014in union parlance, scabs\u2014brought in from such places as the Lingerie Football League (yes, this is a real thing) after the National Football League had locked out its regular refs over a collective bargaining dispute. Even union-busting Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, displaying an impressive lack of self awareness, gnashed his teeth <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GovWalker/status/250569135719849984\">on twitter and cried \"#Returntherealrefs\". </a>Forget the teachers and first responders stripped of their bargaining rights, let's remember the real victims: the Cheeseheads.</p> <p>Packers fans, as they are also known, are more socially minded than most; the Packers are the only major professional team that is not-for-profit and publicly owned by their community. The same can't be said for the rest of the NFL, which decided to shut out their refs in order to force them to accept the League's unilateral demands. Those include concessions unique to a seasonal workforce, such as taking away refs' current 15 game work guarantee. But the real issue on which the dispute hinges is a familiar one for most people, even those who don't wear zebra striped shirts to work every day: retirement security.</p> <p>The NFL wants to get rid of refs' current pension plan and replace it with a 401(k). This entails a switch from a defined benefit to a defined contribution plan: from one that guarantees a certain level of retirement income to one that does not. If the words \"defined benefit\" sound foreign to you, you're not alone: fewer and fewer employers offer them, and those that still do\u2014including IBM, Coca-Cola, Kraft, General Electric, General Motors, American Airlines, SunTrust, 3M, and at least two NFL teams, the Washington Redskins and Tampa Bay Buccaneers\u2014are rolling them back and cutting off new hires. But defined benefit pensions were once the rule and not the exception. At their peak in 1985, there were 112,000 such plans; last year there were just over 25,000, with only 22 percent of companies in <a href=\"www.shrm.org/research/surveyfindings/articles/documents/2011_emp_benefits_report.pdf\">a recent survey</a> saying they offered one.</p> <p>The push by employers to switch to defined contribution plans coincided with the stock market boom of the 1990s, with big returns easing the transition with minimal complaint. When the market tanked, employers responded with halfhearted measures such as setting target funding dates and offering personal investment advice. For the most part though, workers were told \"you're on your own.\"</p> <p>There are several reasons why the referees' lockout matters for Americans in general. First because the concessions don't stop there: <a href=\"www.pensionrights.org/publications/fact-sheet/companies-have-changed-or-temporarily-suspended-their-401k-matching-contribu\">the list of employers that have offered 401(k) plans and then either reduced or suspended matching contributions is long and growing</a>. Secondly because Social Security is not enough to retire on: <a href=\"www.gao.gov/new.items/d10632r.pdf\">median level benefits replace just 47% of average earnings</a>, an amount less than a minimum wage income. And finally, because older workers have been especially hard hit by the recession. <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-12-445\">The Government Accountability Office found that workers 55 and older have experienced a sharp rise in long-term unemployment since 2007</a>, much more than younger workers. Long term unemployment eats into savings and decreases future retirement income, which, according to the GAO, \"can put older workers at risk of deferring needed medical care, losing their homes, and accumulating debt.\" The push by employers to erase pensions is, in today's climate, particularly bad news for a particularly vulnerable population.</p> <p>What's most appalling is the absurdly small amount of money over which the League is willing to force out its refs: <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/nfl-referees-dispute-2012-9\">$3.3 million</a>. This is equal to the salary of one halfway decent cornerback, and a fraction of what a single team earns from stadium parking fees alone. More than any other pro sport, owning a football team is like having a license to print money: with a handful of exceptions (e.g. the Detroit Lions), teams are almost never unprofitable. The Dallas Cowboys earned $500 million in total revenue last year. The League as a whole made $9 billion. The same attitude can be seen in other companies such as <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/27/caterpillar-strike-open-season-unions\">Caterpillar, which demanded pension cuts from workers at a time it was enjoying record-breaking profits</a> and shrinking labor costs, and crushed a strike in order to get what it wanted.</p> <p>The message to referees couldn't be clearer: it's not about the money, but about power. The NFL doesn't want a negotiating partner. It wants to call the shots on everything, no matter the irrelevance to its bottom line. And it would rather subject fans to boneheaded calls than give up an iota of control.</p>",
  "<p>In 2009, I was commissioned by the fashion magazine of the New York Times to shoot a new Prada collection. This picture is of <a href=\"http://www.jonahbokaer.net\" title=\"\">Jonah Bokaer</a>, a dancer and choreographer, who cast various other dancers for the shoot. As a starting point, we had a list of words: \"implode\", \"fractious\", \"staccato\", \"frenetic\", \"fluidity\" \u2013 that sort of thing. Each dancer had to take a word and improvise, expanding on a certain way of thinking or moving. Jonah, who was responding to the word \"release\", started doing these incredible falls, which is where this picture came from. It reminded me of the writhing businessmen in <a href=\"http://www.unfinishedman.com/robert-longo-men-in-the-cities/\" title=\"\">Robert Longo's Men in the Cities paintings</a>, which I've always found compelling.</p> <p>We rehearsed one day and shot the whole of the next, doing group pictures, solo shots, <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/21447035\" title=\"\">and making a film, too</a>. It was one of the most fulfilling fashion stories I've worked on.</p> <p>I love working with dancers: with all that natural talent and training at your disposal, you can transcend the normal boundaries of a shoot. It is as if you're suddenly able to speak with a richer vocabulary. There was music playing in the background, but that wasn't the motivation behind their movements.</p> <p>I have always been drawn to movement in art, perhaps because my mother was a ballet dancer and <a href=\"http://www.jakesutton.co.uk/paintarch.htm\" title=\"\">my father was an artist</a>. So with photography, the magic for me lies in challenging the boundaries of a medium that is so static, and giving it energy.</p> <p>I particularly like the images of Jonah because of the commitment and balance in his falls. It&nbsp;is almost like someone has pulled the&nbsp;plug on him, yet he is managing to maintain an elegance. You can get a lot&nbsp;of people to throw themselves on the floor but, for most, it doesn't look&nbsp;so balanced. I found his awareness&nbsp;of where his body is, and how he has managed to find that shape, quite exciting.</p> <p>Immediately after this, Jonah hit the floor \u2013 hard. I don't know how bruised he got. Dancers are used to the brutal toll their work takes on their bodies and they know how to land.

David Cameron's statement, at the UN general assembly in New York, comes despite growing calls from members of his own party to rein in Britain's aid spending.</p> <p>Over the last two weeks, conservative British newspapers, including the Sunday Telegraph and the Daily Mail, have attacked the Department for International Development (DfID) for spending millions of British aid money<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9545584/Poverty-barons-who-make-a-fortune-from-taxpayer-funded-aid-budget.html\" title=\"\"> on a group of highly profitable consultancy firms</a>.

Note that DfID, <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/publications1/departmental-report/2012/Annual-report-accounts-2011-12.pdf\" title=\"\">which spent \u00a37.6bn on ODA last year </a> isn't the only government department in charge of UK aid. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the UK Border Agency, for example, also contribute towards the 0.7% target.</p> <p>The UK is the world's third largest donor from countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), following Germany ($14.5bn) and the US ($30.7bn). But as a percentage of gross national income (GNI), British aid spending was 0.56% in 2011 \u2013 far greater than the US equivalent of 0.20%. Only five OECD countries \u2013 Sweden, Norway, Luxembourg, Denmark, and the Netherlands \u2013 have already met the 0.7% commitment.</p> <p>What does this mean for the UK taxpayer? With a population of about 62.6 million, last year's \u00a38.57bn spend works out at roughly \u00a3137 per head.</p> <p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApF51UgS889tdDRIRGg3V2dWNEJoR1dLWVRreVphOUE\" title=\"\">\u2022 Get the data</a></p> <h2>Which countries get UK aid?</h2> <p>Last year, DfID announced that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/mar/01/uk-cuts-aid-poorest-countries?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">16 countries would no longer receive bilateral aid from Britain by 2016</a>, as a result of the department's spending reviews.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/mar/01/uk-aid-review-cuts-dfid\">biggest announced increase</a> in aid was for Somalia, with a 208% rise planned between 2010 and 2015. This was followed by Nigeria, with an increase of 116%. By 2015, Pakistan would receive the largest chunk of UK aid \u2013 \u00a31.4bn, up 107% from 2010.</p> <p>Billions of aid are also spent through groups such as the World Bank, the EU, and UN agencies. Last year, the UK spent <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/publications1/departmental-report/2012/Annual-report-accounts-2011-12.pdf\">\u00a35bn on bilateral aid programmes and \u00a33.5bn on multilateral aid</a>.

But within sectors, interesting trends are apparent. For example, according to the data, reproductive, maternal and newborn health will consume nearly 64% of DfID's global health funding by 2015, while the share of bilateral aid for HIV and Aids will drop from 16% in 2010-11 to less than 6% in 2014-15.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/datablog/2011/oct/05/datablog-future-plans-uk-aid\" title=\"\">\u2022 Read more</a></p> <h2>How has UK aid spending changed over time?</h2> <p>The UK has a long-standing foreign aid programme. But how has the geography of UK aid spending changed over time? Last year, the Guardian pulled out all the data on UK aid spending since 1960 to follow the money trail.</p> <p>In 1960, among the top recipients of UK aid were Cyprus and Malta. One year later, this had already changed dramatically: in 1961, Kenya and India were top recipients. India received the largest chunk of UK aid for most of the 1960s and 1970s. The turn of the new millennium saw an explosion in the number of UK aid recipients.</p> <p><a href=\"https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdGY4VXR1RmRkY0dOUG9jejNEM0JNaEE&amp;hl=en\" title=\"\">\u2022 Get the data</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/apr/14/uk-aid-spending-history\">Read more</a></p> <h2>The<strong> </strong>business of UK aid</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398851175\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/26/1348672247057/Picture_112.png\" alt=\"DfID's top contractors\" width=\"452\" height=\"291\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Location of DfID's top contractors.

Of nearly 120 major contracts and procurement agreements (together worth almost \u00a3750m) published on the government's contracts portal since January 2011, only nine include non-UK firms among the grantees.

Watch here</a></p> <p>Soon, we will all be living in a time where no new Twilight films are made. It's going to be a terrifying time, one without any badly written female protagonists or weirdly conservative sexual morals or anything that will present them with any wildly unrealistic relationship expectations at all. However will we cope?</p> <p>Perhaps the answer lies with next year's Beautiful Creatures. Like Twilight, it's based on a series of bestselling young-adult novels. Like Twilight, it's a story of young love against all odds. Like Twilight, most people over the age of 17 will probably develop an instant allergic reaction to it. And, like Twilight, it's probably going to be huge. So here, based on its first trailer, is what to expect from Beautiful Creatures:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-404058202\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348583253564/Beautiful-Creatures-1-008.jpg\" alt=\"Beautiful Creatures 1\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beautiful Creatures 1</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>1) The Beautiful Creatures trailer opens with a young girl named Lena on her first day at a new school. Having seen Twilight, this clearly means that she's about to fall in love with someone much older and much wiser, with smouldering eyes, a cool haircut and a dark secret. That someone is \u2026</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-404058203\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348583293937/Beautiful-Creatures-2-008.jpg\" alt=\"Beautiful Creatures 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beautiful Creatures 2</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>2) Emma Thompson? Really? Well, I suppose she is much older than Lena, and that's a pretty funky quiff she's rocking. And, judging from the three distinct accents that she keeps alternating between in this scene, maybe her dark secret is that she's not really American at all. If Lena wants to fall in love with Emma Thompson, let her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-404058204\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348583355522/Beautiful-Creatures-3-008.jpg\" alt=\"Beautiful Creatures 3\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beautiful Creatures 3</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>3) Except that's not the case. Remembering the time she was forced to watch Nanny McPhee on a plane as a child, Lena rejects Emma Thompson's advances so violently that she smashes a load of windows with her mind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-404058205\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348583588229/Beautiful-Creatures-4-008.jpg\" alt=\"Beautiful Creatures 4\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beautiful Creatures 4</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>4) This is Lena, by the way. You have to admit that she's not really like Bella Swan at all. Her hair is a slightly different colour, for starters, and she doesn't look as if she resents every minute of starring in a popular film.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-404058206\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348583550326/Beautiful-Creatures-5-008.jpg\" alt=\"Beautiful Creatures 5\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beautiful Creatures 5</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>5) Perhaps that's because she's just met this guy, the Beautiful Creatures Robert Pattinson equivalent. Yes, his hair is a little neater than Pattinson's and, yes, he appears to have had his neck surgically removed at birth, but Lena falls in love with him anyway. Necks are so overrated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-404058207\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348583511729/Beautiful-Creatures-6-008.jpg\" alt=\"Beautiful Creatures 6\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beautiful Creatures 6</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>6) However, it turns out that Lena is probably a witch or something, and the tattoo on her hand keeps counting down the days to her 16th birthday. This, she says, is when she might get claimed by the dark side. But what does that actually mean?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-404058208\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348583477105/Beautiful-Creatures-7-008.jpg\" alt=\"Beautiful Creatures 7\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beautiful Creatures 7</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>7) Well, Lena's sister was claimed by the dark side, and look how she turned out. Not only has the dark side given her a taste for hugely impractical clothes, but she's also wearing sunglasses indoors. What an unbearable hipster. Apparently the dark side makes you act like you're from Shoreditch. She probably thinks that electroclash is still a thing, too. No wonder Lena's so scared of the dark side.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-404058209\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348583444974/Beautiful-Creatures-8-008.jpg\" alt=\"Beautiful Creatures 8\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beautiful Creatures 8</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>8) What's more, the townspeople have taken against Lena for smashing all those windows earlier. They form an angry mob, carrying signs that say things like \"Say no to Satan!\" and \"Lena's a danger to our children!\" and, adhering to the law stating that no angry mob should ever know how to use an apostrophe properly, \"Ravenwoods unnatural\". With everything against her like this, it's up to the Beautiful Creatures Robert Pattinson equivalent to save Lena. But how?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-404058210\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348583387866/Beautiful-Creatures-9-008.jpg\" alt=\"Beautiful Creatures 9\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beautiful Creatures 9</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>9) By rubbing a tiny enchanted toilet seat, of course. Spoiler alert: in Beautiful Creatures, everything is apparently fixed by rubbing a tiny enchanted toilet seat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-404058211\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348583619182/Beautiful-Creatures-10-008.jpg\" alt=\"Beautiful Creatures 10\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beautiful Creatures 10</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>10) It works! To celebrate, Lena and the Beautiful Creatures Robert Pattinson equivalent kiss in one of the most profoundly disturbing ways I think I've ever seen. Who needs Twilight, anyway?</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday Sir Peter Stothard, editor of the Times Literary Supplement and chair of the judges for this year's Man Booker prize, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/25/books-bloggers-literature-booker-prize-stothard\" title=\"\">hit out at book bloggers</a>. The rise of blogs will, he says, be \"to the detriment of literature\". They are in competition with \"traditional, confident criticism\" and the end result will be that \"people will be encouraged to buy and read books that are no good, the good will be overwhelmed, and we'll be worse off\". Who is the <em>we</em> to whom he refers? And is he right? Are bloggers merely self-published critics, facing as much of an uphill battle for respect as self-published authors? Are they insufficiently authoritative and rigorous, too in thrall to the latest book-with-buzz, too easily swayed by publicists' puff?</p> <p>He's got a point. Anyone can start a blog. Bloggers are not commissioned, not edited, don't have to be good enough at it to earn money from it. But these are strengths as well as weaknesses: no limitations based on what a literary editor has space for, or a taste for; no need to turn them out at a certain rate to earn a living; and they must earn their own readership, with no support structure. The expected response to Stothard's comments would be: Of course there are inessential blogs, just as there are inessential literary critics. Hasn't he heard of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_Law\" title=\"\">Sturgeon's Law</a>? But Stothard seems to reject that too: \"Not everyone's opinion is worth the same. [A]s much as one would like to think that many bloggers' opinions are as good as others. It just ain't so.\"</p> <p>I wonder, then, if Stothard can have read <a href=\"http://this-space.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">This Space</a> by Steve Mitchelmore (Britain's first book blogger), or Mark Thwaite's <a href=\"http://www.readysteadybook.com/BookReviews.aspx\" title=\"\">ReadySteadyBook</a> (which carried <a href=\"http://www.readysteadybook.com/BookReview.aspx?isbn=9781846554896\" title=\"\">the best critical response to Enrique Vila-Matas's novel Dublinesque</a> that I saw, online or off), or Max Cairnduff's <a href=\"http://pechorinsjournal.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">Pechorin's Journal</a>, or <a href=\"http://kevinfromcanada.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">Kevin from Canada</a>, or dozens of others that I visit regularly. Here are skilled reviewers offering thoughtful, informed criticism of a wider range of books than any traditional literary publication. What blogs can give readers is a sense of trust that, in professional circles, only the biggest lit-crit names \u2013 such as James Wood or Michiko Kakutani \u2013 can attain: a \"criticism with personality\". They are expressing opinions about books in particular, and literature in general, based on a particular life of reading, written in a critical but non-technical language. What they can also give, crucially, is attention to books other than the newly published.</p> <p>I have an interest here, as <a href=\"http://theasylum.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">I too run a blog</a>, but I don't feel myself to be naturally in opposition to Stothard. I agree with his comments in support of his panel's Booker shortlist: \"If the English novel does nothing to renew the English language, then it really doesn't do anything. The great works of art have to renew the language in which they're written. They have to offer a degree of resistance.\" That's why I do my best on my blog to champion books which I think are important because they do make language new, such as Keith Ridgway's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781847085269/hawthorn-and-child\" title=\"\">Hawthorn &amp; Child</a> or Hugo Wilcken's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780007106486/colony\" title=\"\">Colony</a>. These are, typically, books that struggle to attain coverage in the traditional outlets for literary criticism. (Hawthorn &amp; Child got a 350-word \"in brief\" review in the TLS, a publication which dispensed with its fiction editor last year.)</p> <p>Also, like Stothard, I worry about the good books being \"overwhelmed\" by the bad. But it seems to me that this is as likely to happen because of literary critics being required to review the latest title from a big literary name, irrespective of quality, as it is by a book blogger evangelising within their particular niche.</p> <p>The books that Stothard and I both want to celebrate \u2013 those with \"extraordinary and exhilarating prose\" \u2013 tend to come from the edges rather than the centre, and increasingly from small presses. He would surely agree, as his panel has this year chosen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2012/sep/11/man-booker-prize-2012-shortlist\" title=\"\">a Booker shortlist</a> on which half the titles come from tiny independents: <a href=\"http://www.saltpublishing.com/\" title=\"\">Salt</a>, <a href=\"http://www.andotherstories.org/\" title=\"\">And Other Stories</a> and <a href=\"http://www.myrmidonbooks.com/\" title=\"\">Myrmidon</a>. These are the publishers who get more attention from bloggers than they do from the literary press, because a one-person blog has a flexibility and manoeuvrability that larger literary publications lack. When Deborah Levy's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781908276025/swimming-home\" title=\"\">Swimming Home</a>, one of the most interesting titles on the shortlist, was published last October, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/07/swimming-home-deborah-levy-review\" title=\"\">the first national newspaper review</a>, in the Guardian, was by a blogger \u2013 me, in fact. Most other papers didn't cover it until it was longlisted for the Booker.</p> <p>The greatest tool bloggers have at their disposal \u2013 to be exercised with caution \u2013 is space. Former fiction editor of the TLS, Lindsay Duguid, said that \"in a short review, you can probably only get over three points\". A blog can explore a book at a length that all but the most prominent literary critics would envy. Today, social networking sites encourage expression to be short and punchy, not balanced and thoughtful. The Man Booker prize this year removed the users' forum from its revamped site, and now limits reader responses to the books to Facebook comments and tweets. In such circumstances, the opportunity that blogs continue to offer for long-form engagement with literature should not be denigrated, but celebrated.</p>",
  "<p>Famed for its hidden fishing villages that cling to soaring cliffs and terraced vineyards that scale almost vertical slopes, Italy's Cinque Terre has long been a magnet for tourists and hikers. But it is facing an uncertain future after a series of deadly mudslides and rockfalls.</p> <p>This week, four Australian tourists tackling the panoramic Trail of Love on the idyllic stretch of the Ligurian coast were seriously injured by cascading boulders, while 1,000 people were evacuated last October when mud surged through two of the area's five villages.</p> <p>The disasters, says the governor of Liguria, are due to a gradual abandoning by farmers of the terraces above the villages and the subsequent collapse of ancient dry stone walls. And in a bid to overcome the problem, he has launched an audacious plan to convince young Italians to return to the land.</p> <p>\"These walls were built up over 1,000 years with huge effort, but they need to be maintained,\" Claudio Burlando said of the terraces, which are believed to contain as many stones as the Great Wall of China.</p> <p>A postwar total of 140,000 farmers in the region of Liguria, which is squeezed between the Apennines and the Mediterranean Sea, has shrunk to just 14,000 today, a number Burlando said he wanted to boost with training courses for woodsmen, shepherds and, crucially, dry stone wallers.</p> <p>\"With the crisis we are losing industry jobs, so if we can train up 400 young people a year we are creating skills and saving the land,\" he said.</p> <p>Unauthorised building, which blocks water courses, has also been blamed for flooding in Liguria, but Burlando said the rockfall that struck the four Australians was directly caused by crumbling stone walls.</p> <p>\"The slopes are about the steepest in Liguria and so the terraces are as narrow as two metres,\" he said. \"If one wall goes down it takes down the next one like a house of cards. From out at sea you can see how many have collapsed.\"</p> <p>After last year's mudslides, stones from walls were removed from debris in the villages, loaded on to helicopters and flown up the slopes to be replaced.</p> <p>Burlando said he was planning legislation that would allow the region to send his young trainees on to private land to undertake repairs if the owner had abandoned it.</p> <p>\"Sometimes the owner is 95 and just can't take care of the land. Farming here isn't easy. It can be so steep your tractor risks falling into the sea,\" he said.</p> <p>The plan would cover Liguria's woodland, he added, \"where the undergrowth can be so overgrown it no longer absorbs the rain\".</p> <p>Burlando saw the plan as a chance to get Italians doing what their parents did. \"A chain has been broken,\" he said. \"We emptied out the countryside to fill the factories yet now we buy from Asia and the service industry is not enough.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Albanian and Turkish immigrants are much in demand for their dry stone walling skills in Liguria. Italians are however beginning to reconsider agriculture, said Burlando. \"A man who grows basil told me had just employed two Italians, something he had not done for 20 years.\"</p>",
  "<p>Russian partners inside the TNK-BP joint venture are talking to financiers about raising money to make a potential $20bn (\u00a312.4bn) cash offer for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/15/tnk-bp-sale-talks-russia\" title=\"\">BP's stake in the oil and gas business</a> as early as next month.</p> <p>The revelations have been met with a steely silence from BP which has developed a profound scepticism about the Moscow-based oligarchs who are still suing the British company in a Siberian court.</p> <p>The Russian partners who control the Alpha Access Renova (AAR) consortium had previously been offering to purchase half of BP's 50% stake in TNK-BP \u2013 but rival interest from state-owned Rosneft has forced it to think again.</p> <p>\"They [AAR] have decided they will make a cash offer for the full BP stake and are beginning to talk to banks,\" said sources close to the Moscow-based consortium.</p> <p>Asked why they had changed their minds, the source said: \"Clearly circumstances have changed and we are dealing with a bidding situation with Rosneft offering cash and shares and BP making clear it is not interested in selling only half of its stake.\"</p> <p>The BP share in TNK-BP is generally thought to be worth $20bn-$25bn but AAR shareholders Mikhail Fridman, Viktor Vekselberg and Len Blavatnik, have apparently not yet decided exactly how much they will offer.</p> <p>AAR had previously said it was willing to pay $10bn for a 25% stake in TNK-BP, Russia's third-largest oil company. BP, which needs cash to help pay for potential liabilities from the Deepwater Horizon accident in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, has already talked to Rosneft and Vladimir Putin about a cash and share swap worth $20bn.</p> <p>BP, which has had a turbulent relationship with AAR, may see benefits from retaining a stronger foothold in Russia through a tie-up with Rosneft even in the face of a full cash offer from the oligarchs.</p> <p>The company declined to comment but outside industry sources said BP senior officials were wary that any offer from AAR was likely to come with strings attached. The previous offer of $10bn from AAR was conditional on $3bn being subtracted to take account of the court case in Omsk being dropped by AAR.</p> <p>Claims were made against BP in West Siberia on the grounds that the British company's now-failed attempt to set up a rival joint venture with Rosneft had damaged the TNK-BP share price.</p> <p>Under the TNK-BP shareholder agreement, only AAR could have an offer accepted before a 90-day deadline from the date when BP announced it wanted to sell its stake elapsed on 17 October. Other bidders may then step in with formal offers, creating the prospect of a bidding contest.</p> <p>Bankers have told Reuters that it would be possible for AAR to finance a significant portion of any purchase by leveraging up TNK-BP, which has paid out $19bn in dividends since BP came into the venture in 2003. But other commentators are sceptical and argue that Kremlin politics could be the deciding factor in any asset sale.</p> <p>There has also been suspicions that Fridman and the other oligarchs would ultimately like to sell their 50% stake in TNK-BP also and have hinted it would see Rosneft as the ultimate buyer.</p> <p>Igor Sechin, chief executive of Rosneft and traditionally close to Putin, was quoted by Russian news agency, RIA Novosti, last week as saying his company would \"consider\" any offer of sale by AAR.</p> <p>TNK-BP posted a record $14.6bn in profits last year and its gross debt was $8bn at the end of 2011, all of it unsecured and most of it long-term. That indicates, some bankers say, TNK-BP's ability to sustain a higher debt burden to finance a possible buyout by AAR.</p> <p>BP has already targeted the raising of $30bn to pay off any claims from the Macondo well blowout in which 11 people died and 17 others were injured. The Department of Justice is still planning to sue BP for gross negligence in a court case scheduled to start in January.</p>",
  "<p>In many of history's most successful economic reforms, clever countries have learned from the policy successes of others, adapting them to local conditions. In the long history of economic development, eighteenth century Britain learned from Holland; early nineteenth-century Prussia learned from Britain and France; mid-nineteenth century Meiji Japan learned from Germany; post-second world war Europe learned from the United States; and Deng Xiaoping's China learned from Japan.</p> <p>Through a process of institutional borrowing and creative adaptation, successful economic institutions and cutting-edge technologies spread around the world, and thereby boost global growth. Today, too, there are some great opportunities for this kind of \"policy arbitrage\", if more countries would only take the time to learn from other countries' successes.</p> <p>For example, while many countries are facing a jobs crisis, one part of the capitalist world is doing just fine: northern Europe, including Germany, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia. Germany's unemployment rate this past summer was around 5.5%, and its youth unemployment rate was around 8% \u2013 remarkably low compared with many other high-income economies.</p> <p>How do northern Europeans do it? All of them use active labour market policies, including flex time, school-to-work apprenticeships (especially Germany), and extensive job training and matching.</p> <p>Likewise, in an age of chronic budget crises, Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland run near-balanced budgets. All three rely on budget rules that call for cyclically adjusted budget balance. And all three take a basic precaution to keep their entitlement spending under control: a retirement age of at least 65. This keeps costs much lower than in France, and Greece, for example, where the retirement age is 60 or below, and where pension outlays are soaring as a result.</p> <p>In an age of rising healthcare costs, most high-income countries \u2013 Canada, the European Union's western economies, and Japan \u2013 manage to keep their total healthcare costs below 12% of GDP, with excellent health outcomes, while the US spends nearly 18% of GDP, yet with decidedly mediocre health outcomes. And, America's is the only for-profit health system of the entire bunch. A new report by the US Institute of Medicine has found that America's for-profit system squanders around $750bn (\u00a3464bn), or 5% of GDP, on waste, fraud, duplication, and bureaucracy.</p> <p>In an age of soaring oil costs, a few countries have made a real difference in energy efficiency. The OECD countries, on average, use 160kg of oil-equivalent energy for every $1,000 of GDP (measured at purchasing power parity). But, in energy-efficient Switzerland, energy use is just 100kg per $1,000 of GDP, and in Demark it is just 110kg, compared with 190 kg in the US.</p> <p>In an age of climate change, several countries are demonstrating how to move to a low-carbon economy. On average, the rich countries emit 2.3kg of CO2 for every kg of oil-equivalent unit of energy. But France emits just 1.4kg, owing to its success in deploying safe, low-cost nuclear energy.</p> <p>Sweden, with its hydropower, is even lower, at 0.9kg. And, while Germany is abandoning domestic production of nuclear energy for political reasons, we can bet that it will nonetheless continue to import electricity from France's nuclear plants.</p> <p>In an age of intense technological competition, countries that combine public and private research and development (R&amp;D) financing are outpacing the rest. The US continues to excel, with huge recent breakthroughs in Mars exploration and genomics, though it is now imperiling that excellence through budget cuts. Meanwhile, Sweden and South Korea are now excelling economically on the basis of R&amp;D spending of around 3.5% of GDP, while Israel's R&amp;D outlays stand at a remarkable 4.7% of GDP.</p> <p>In an age of rising inequality, at least some countries have narrowed their wealth and income gaps. Brazil is the recent pacesetter, markedly expanding public education and systematically attacking remaining pockets of poverty through targeted transfer programmes. As a result, income inequality in Brazil is declining.</p> <p>And, in an age of pervasive anxiety, Bhutan is asking deep questions about the meaning and nature of happiness itself. In search of a more balanced society that combines economic prosperity, social cohesion, and environmental sustainability, Bhutan famously pursues Gross National Happiness rather than Gross National Product. Many other countries \u2013 including the United Kingdom \u2013 are now following Bhutan's lead in surveying their citizenry about life satisfaction.</p> <p>The countries highest on the ladder of life satisfaction are Denmark, Finland, and Norway. Yet there is hope for those at lower latitudes as well. Tropical Costa Rica also ranks near the top of the happiness league. What we can say is that all of the happiest countries emphasise equality, solidarity, democratic accountability, environmental sustainability, and strong public institutions.</p> <p>So here is one model economy: German labour-market policies, Swedish pensions, French low-carbon energy, Canadian healthcare, Swiss energy efficiency, American scientific curiosity, Brazilian anti-poverty programmes, and Costa Rican tropical happiness.</p> <p>Of course, back in the real world, most countries will not achieve such bliss anytime soon. But, by opening our eyes to policy successes abroad, we would surely speed the path to national improvement in countries around the world.</p>",
  "<p>Nick Clegg has fired the starting gun on the 2015 general election by announcing that the former party leader Lord Ashdown will be put in charge of the Liberal Democrat campaign team.</p> <p>The Lib Dem leader and deputy prime minister used his keynote speech at the close of the annual party conference in Brighton to make clear his intention to lead the party into the general election as he spelled out the party's priorities for the duration of the coalition term and beyond.</p> <p>He announced the decision to sign up Ashdown in a move that will be seen as seeking to quell rumblings about his own future at the helm amid polling suggesting party fortunes would improve under Vince Cable.</p> <p>Issuing a warning to his coalition partners, Clegg made clear there would be \"no question\" of reducing the 45p top rate of tax further and put David Cameron on notice that he should hold \"short-sighted\" Conservatives to their promises on the environment.</p> <p>In a speech otherwise light on policy announcements, Clegg also announced \u00a350m in catch-up classes to help children who have underperformed in English and maths at Key Stage 2.</p> <p>Drawing on the spirit shown by Team GB during the Olympic Games, Clegg sought to rally the party's grassroots by saying the participants had shown that for most people \"success doesn't come easy or quick\" and required effort, perseverance and resilience.</p> <p>\"These are the qualities that will see our country through these tough times. And these are the qualities that will guide our party through tough times, too. So let us take our example from the British people as together we embark on the journey ahead. Our party: from the comforts of opposition to the hard realities of government. Our country: from the sacrifices of austerity to the rewards of shared prosperity. Two journeys linked; the success of each depending on the success of the other. Neither will be easy and neither will be quick, but it will be worth it. And be in no doubt. If we secure our country's future, we will secure our own.\"</p> <p>Hailing a series of successes in securing Lib-Dem-inspired policies, Clegg said those party members who, faced by \"several years more of spending restraint\" would rather \"turn back than press on\", needed to recognise that the Lib Dems were no longer the party of protest for disaffected voters and their only meaningful future was as the \"third party of government\".</p> <p>Unveiling the decision to co-opt Ashdown to spearhead the next general election campaign, Clegg said activists would have a strong message to give to voters thanks to the policies pushed through by the party in power, such as the pupil premium and the raising of the personal tax allowance.</p> <p>\"Because the truth is, only the Liberal Democrats can be trusted on the economy and relied upon to deliver a fairer society too. And to help get that message out there, I can announce today that Paddy Ashdown has agreed to front up our campaign as chair of the 2015 general election team. I must admit, I'm not quite sure I'm ready for all those urgent emails and 5am phone calls. But I can't think of anyone I'd rather have by my side. Paddy, it's great to have you back.\"</p> <p>He braced his party for more tough times ahead as he set out the \"inescapable\" need for further belt-tightening beyond 2015. But he laid down the party's priorities as he reiterated his determination to ensure the rich shoulder the burden of an additional \u00a316bn of public spending cuts expected in 2015-16. \"Our position is clear. If we have to ask people to take less out or pay more in, we'll start with the richest and work our way down, not the other way around,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We won't waver in our determination to deal with our debts. But we will do it in our own way, according to our own plans, based on our own values.\"</p> <p>He singled out the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, for particular criticism as he launched a staunch defence of the coalition's economic \"Plan A\", insisting it was \"tough enough yet flexible\" and would allow more \"bold steps\".</p> <p>He defended the latest budget, despite the outcry over the decision to cut the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p, because of the key Lib Dem policies implemented as a result, including increasing the tax-free allowance. But he made clear the cut in the top rate of tax already introduced was as far as he was prepared to go.</p> <p>\"Let me make one thing clear: now that we have brought the top rate of tax down to 45p \u2013 a level, let's not forget, that is still higher than throughout Labour's 13 years in office \u2013 there can be no question of reducing it further in this parliament,\" he said. \"All future cuts in personal taxation must pass one clear test: do they help people on low and middle incomes get by and get on? It's as simple as that.\"</p> <p>Clegg also made clear that the environment would be a core priority for the party to help \"power our economy\".</p> <p>Dismissing the Conservatives' \"short-sighted arguments\" that the choice was between \"going green and going for growth\", he said: \"Going green means going forward.\"</p> <p>\"So let the Conservatives be in no doubt. We will hold them to their promises on the environment. Of course, there was a time when it looked like they got it. It seems a long time ago now. When the Tories were going through their naturalist phase. The windmills gently turning; the sun shining in. As a PR exercise, it was actually quite brilliant. Until, at last year's party conference, they went and ruined it all, admitting that you can't in fact \"vote blue and go green\". Well of course you can't. To make blue go green you have to add yellow, and that's exactly what we're doing.\"</p>",

In a career that spanned eight decades, he sold more than 100m albums. Ronald Reagan described Williams's distinctive voice as&#xa0;a \"national treasure\".</p> <p>The Andy Williams Show was also a&#xa0;favourite on British television and he had numerous UK hits in the 1960s and 70s. Among the biggest were <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUeaqHHq2II&amp;noredirect=1\" title=\"\">Can't Get Used to Losing You (1963)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McnWTXmfsFY\" title=\"\">Can't Help Falling in Love (1970) </a>and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad9SV2rb4Ns\" title=\"\">Where Do I&#xa0;Begin (1971),</a> the theme from the 1970 film Love Story.</p> <p>Williams's British career was revived in 1998 when his 30-year-old hit Can't Take My Eyes Off You was used in a commercial for Peugeot cars. Soon, a&#xa0;Fiat advertisement revived Music to Watch Girls By, and The Most Wonderful Time of the Year (from one of his eight Christmas albums) was chosen for a Marks &amp; Spencer Christmas campaign in&#xa0;2002. He even appeared in an episode of Strictly Come Dancing in 2009 to sing Moon River.</p> <p>Williams grew up in Wall Lake, Iowa, the second youngest of six children, to&#xa0;Jay and Florence Williams. His father, a railway worker, arranged for Andy and his three elder brothers, Bob, Don and Dick, to be the choir at&#xa0;the town's Presbyterian church. The&#xa0;quality of&#xa0;their harmonising inspired Jay to&#xa0;train the quartet for a professional career, beginning with performances at weddings and socials. His ambition for the boys led the family to move to&#xa0;Des Moines in 1936 to seek a regular radio show. There, Jay's perfectionism hardened into an obsession: Andy was to claim that his self-confidence was deeply dented by Jay's edict that \"you have to practise harder because you're not as good as others out there\".</p> <p>The Williams Brothers were eventually awarded their own 15-minute show on a station where Reagan was a sports reporter. But the family were still not well off, and when the youngest child died of spinal meningitis, the only way the family could pay the funeral costs was for the brothers to sing hymns at the funeral parlour after school for several months.</p> <p>There were further moves to Chicago and Cincinnati so that the Williams Brothers could perform on more prestigious radio stations, and in 1944 the family uprooted again to Los Angeles. There, Jay Williams, by now his sons' full-time manager, negotiated a studio contract with MGM, which gave the quartet cameo roles in several B movies. He also persuaded Bing Crosby to employ them as backing singers on his hit record Swinging on a Star.</p> <p>The group broke up as each brother was called up for second world war service \u2013 the 17-year-old Andy was briefly in the merchant navy \u2013 and did not re-form until 1947. They next performed as a cabaret act, appearing in Las Vegas and the Caf\u00e9 de Paris in London before splitting up in 1953. The actor and choreographer Kay Thompson then launched Andy on a solo career, which ignited when he landed a job as resident vocalist on Steve Allen's late night television show on NBC (1954-56).</p> <p>In 1956 he signed a recording contract with Cadence, and the following year had a No 1 hit in both the US and Britain with Butterfly. Although Williams studied Elvis Presley's recordings, he avoided rock'n'roll and had four more top 10 hits with ballads. In 1961 CBS offered him a lucrative record deal.</p> <p>The 1960s were to be his golden decade. The Andy Williams Show ran on NBC from 1962 to 1971, with consistently high ratings, and he had at least one album in the US top 10 in every year, aided by his musical director, the acclaimed jazz pianist Dave Grusin. The essential blandness of the show was reassuring to middle America, but it introduced new singers, notably the Osmonds, whom Jay Williams had spotted performing at Disneyland, and the fledgling Jackson Five, featuring a&#xa0;seven-year-old <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/jun/26/michael-jackson-obituary\" title=\"\">Michael</a>.</p> <p>The popularity of the show kept the crooning Williams afloat during the tidal wave of pop in the 1960s. Also, while contemporaries such as Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett were baritones, Williams, a tenor, shared his vocal range with the Beatles and Beach Boys.</p> <p>All his albums of the 1960s sold more than 1m copies each, with Moon River and Days of Wine and Roses each selling almost 2m. The latter was No 1 in&#xa0;the album charts for 16 weeks in 1963. When his contract with CBS came up for renewal in 1966, his manager, Alan Bernard, negotiated an unprecedented guarantee against royalties of $1.5m. In return, Williams agreed to record 15 albums over the next five years.</p> <p>The formula for his albums was carefully calculated to attract fans of&#xa0;the television show. Williams seldom recorded new or unknown songs. Instead, he chose a mix of titles from successful movies, Broadway shows and&#xa0;versions of recent pop hits. Williams and his producer, Bob Mersey, were careful to include material by songwriters of the rock era, albeit their most melodic numbers. Thus, he recorded songs from the pens of Lennon and McCartney (Michelle), Burt&#xa0;Bacharach (Don't You Believe It) and Jim Webb (McArthur Park).</p> <p>On one occasion, he decided to experiment with a \"concept\" album of songs by the arranger Mason Williams (no relation), depicting existence from birth to death. Clive Davis, the head of CBS Records, warned him that sales would suffer. After some haggling, the concept songs took up one side of&#xa0;the LP Bridge Over&#xa0;Troubled Water. Davis was proved right and the album sold only half a&#xa0;million copies.</p> <p>The loss of his television show led to falling record sales for Williams in the early 1970s. However, his celebrity enabled him to play lucrative concerts and cabaret engagements throughout the US and Europe. In 1992 he opened his own Moon River theatre in Branson, Missouri, where he appeared for several months each year.</p> <p>Although he was a lifelong Republican, Williams became a close friend of Robert and Ethel Kennedy in the mid-60s. He was present when Kennedy was assassinated in Los Angeles during the 1968 campaign for the presidential nomination. Williams sang The Battle Hymn of the Republic at the funeral and voted for George McGovern at the Democratic party convention, having been nominated as a delegate by Kennedy. More in keeping with his political convictions was his outspoken criticism of Barack Obama, and he allowed the rightwing radio commentator Rush Limbaugh to broadcast his recording of Born Free with added gunshot sounds. Sony Music (now the owner of CBS Records) forced Limbaugh to remove it.</p> <p>Williams was married twice. He had three children, Noelle, Christian and Bobby, named after Robert Kennedy, with his first wife, the singer and dancer Claudine Longet. After their divorce, he was publicly supportive when, following the death of her new partner in a shooting incident, she was found guilty of criminally negligent homicide in 1977. He is survived by his second wife, Debbie Haas, and his children.</p> <p>\u2022 Andy (Howard Andrew) Williams, singer, born 3 December 1927; died 25 September 2012</p>",
  "<p>\"I might retire, now I've found a way to make myself redundant,\" chuckles Brian Eno, fairly early on in our conversation in his West London studio.</p> <p>Hold the headlines, though. Eno is neither redundant nor packing in the day job. But working with his collaborator Peter Chilvers, he has released an app called <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/app/scape/id506703636?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">Scape</a> that enables any iPad owner to create \"generative\" music with some of his own compositional tools and sounds.</p> <p>It launched earlier in September, described on the App Store as an app that \"makes music that thinks for itself\", as well as \"a new form of album which offers users deep access to its musical elements\".</p> <p>The creative side involves creating scenes \u2013 'Scapes' \u2013&#xa0;by choosing backgrounds and colours, then dragging shapes onto them in various combinations. The result is ambient music that's not under your direct control, but rather plays itself based on the scene you've created.</p> <p>It's the follow-up to a previous app made by Eno and Chilvers, called <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bloom/id292792586?mt=8\">Bloom</a>, which was released for iPhones in the early days of the App Store: October 2008. However, Scape's roots go a long way further back than that.</p> <p>\"I got interested in the idea of music that could make itself, in a sense, in the mid 1960s really, when I first heard composers like Terry Riley, and when I first started playing with tape recorders,\" says Eno. </p> <p>\"I had two tape recorders on the floor and one piece of tape connecting the two of them, which effectively gave you a very long echo, and you could build up sounds one on top of the other.\"</p> <p>Eno said what was exciting about this was the way he almost \"lost control of the music\", which became a theme that he pursued.</p> <p>\"I felt that what was very interesting to do as a composer was to construct some kind of system or process which did the composing for you. You'd then feed inputs into it, and it would reconfigure it and make something beyond what you had predicted,\" he says.</p> <p>\"I worked on things like that for a while: Music for Airports and Discreet Music were examples, but they represented were recordings of these processes in action. What I really wanted to do was to be able to sell the process to somebody, not just my output of it.\"</p> <h2>Owning the process</h2> <p>Fast-forward a few decades, and this is the focus of Scape, and Eno's partnership with Chilvers \u2013&#xa0;who'd been working on similar ideas since composing generative music soundtracks for the Creatures series of computer games in the mid-to-late 1990s.</p> <p>\"It led me onto a collision course with Brian,\" he says. \"We were trying to solve the same problems for different reasons.\"</p> <p>Bloom as an application existed before the App Store, after Eno and Chilvers got excited about the potential for touchscreen smartphones following the release of Apple's first iPhone in 2007.</p> <p>\"Suddenly you had the possibility of people being able to own the process rather than the results of the process,\" says Eno, who adds that the pair were working on Bloom as a Flash demo on a Wacom tablet-equipped computer, while hoping that Apple would provide a way for them to port it to iPhones.</p> <p>\"It was a hopeful bootstrapping into the future \u2013&#xa0;'One day, an app store will exist! And if it does, we've got something they can sell\u2026',\" says Eno.</p> <p>\"If you look at it retrospectively, it looks very logical what has happened, given both of our backgrounds, and how it all sort of conspired to reach this point.\"</p> <p>After Bloom, came Scape, which is probably best explained by Eno and Chilvers' own video demo:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8zNLlKRrUVk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"259\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/8zNLlKRrUVk?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/8zNLlKRrUVk?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"460\" height=\"259\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p>The pair explain that many of the sounds and backgrounds from Scape began in full compositions by Eno, before being isolated for the app.</p> <p>\"Often, things in here have begun as music, and have then been disassembled into their genes. This is a way of recombining the genes to make new creatures,\" he says. \"It started out as music, it didn't start out as a bunch of random, funny electronic sounds. They all have a history of working in company with each other.\"</p> <p>He also stresses that Scape is meant to be a listening experience, not just about flinging sounds onto the scenes. </p> <p>That's shown in the way it can continue running in the background while you use other apps - \"people might use this for reading\" \u2013&#xa0;as well as the option to listen to Eno and Chilvers' own individual scapes, and 10 arranged into an album.</p> <p>\"One reason we wanted to put some of our own work in there is to show people that this is actually about listening rather than playing all the time,\" says Eno.</p> <p>\"You're setting up the initial conditions, then letting the thing run. It's meant to be a listening experience, primarily. We wanted to show that you could actually treat these results as music rather than just games.\"</p> <h2>Borrowing from games</h2> <p>Scape borrows from games in other ways, though. When you first use Scape, there is a limited number of shapes, backgrounds and moods. The more you use it, the more elements you unlock for use, one at a time.</p> <p>It's not quite an achievements system \u2013&#xa0;I mention the idea of gamification to Eno and he politely replies \"I haven't heard that word before\" \u2013&#xa0;but it does reward you for playing with the app, while also giving you more time to understand the individual elements and how they combine rather than throwing its entire toolbox at you from the start.</p> <p>\"As soon as you get another sound, you spend a bit of time with it: it's like being given a whole extra album, this gradual drip-feed of features,\" says Chilvers. \"We're very curious to see how people react to this. They'll get the most out of it if they are patient. It may take a month to unlock everything.\"</p> <p>Some of the sounds are brand new, but others are older. Two of the bass sounds are more than 10 years old, and one is more than 20 years old according to Eno \u2013&#xa0;another sign of his desire to give people some of the compositional tools he has used for his own music.</p> <p>\"There are certain sounds that I've found work well in nearly any context,\" he says. \"Their function is not so much musical as spatial: they define the edges of the territory of the music\u2026 They are pictorial elements that create the foreground and background, and make the space in the middle. They activate it, and that's the space you can then put things in.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396727889\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/26/1348669039700/scape-2.jpg\" alt=\"Scape iPad app by Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scape users can listen to the compositions of Eno and Chilvers</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That idea of space is important: you're creating pictures \u2013 well, scenes \u2013&#xa0;as well as sounds in Scape. Eno relates this back to his attempts to make \"sonic paintings of places\" with past albums, and also to the days when recording technology started to become much more accessible to musicians.</p> <p>He describes this as having taken music \"out of time and into space\", making it material \u2013&#xa0;something on a record, a CD or in a computer, rather than a live performance that is not preserved.</p> <p>\"Once music ceases to be ephemeral \u2013&#xa0;always disappearing \u2013&#xa0;and becomes instead material\u2026 it leaves the condition of traditional music and enters the condition of painting. It becomes a painting, existing as material in space, not immaterial in time\" says Eno.</p> <p>\"In the 1960s when the recording studio suddenly really took off as a tool, it was the kids from art school who knew how to use it, not the kids from music school. Music students were all stuck in the notion of music as performance, ephemeral. Whereas for art students, music as painting? They knew how to do that.\"</p> <p>Chilvers adds that a lot of musicians \u2013&#xa0;although by no means all \u2013&#xa0;find generative music a challenge, because it means relinquishing control, and the idea of mastering an instrument.</p> <p>\"Scape is more of an act of curation rather than composition,\" he says. \"It's slightly alien, and there's a certain sense of confusion when people come to a music app like this\u2026 People have a concept that apps are tools or games, but with music, it's something of a grey area.\"</p> <h2>14-year-old upstarts</h2> <p>Might musicians also feel threatened, or at least a bit defensive, about the idea of apps like Scape letting anyone have a go at music composition (well, \"curation\") even if they don't have traditional music skills?</p> <p>You see a similar thing in the way some (again, not all) photographers have the hump with Instagram, for turning techniques that used to require specialist knowledge into a one-tap filter for any amateur snapper to use.</p> <p>\"If you've spent a long time developing a skill and techniques, and now some 14 year-old upstart can get exactly the same result, you might feel a bit miffed I suppose, but that has happened forever,\" says Eno.</p> <p>\"It happened with synthesizers, on quite a formal level when string synthesizers first existed. The musicians unions tried to insist that they would never be used because they replaced string players, which of course they didn't. String players have never had more work!\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396727890\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/26/1348669189259/scape-3.jpg\" alt=\"Scape iPad app by Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The more you use Scape, the more elements you unlock</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One last question on Scape concerns its social features. You can email scapes as attachments to friends, who can then open them in the app, if they own it.</p> <p>Might Eno and Chilvers go further in future updates in terms of helping people share their creations with the wider world? Other music app developers, like Smule, have put an emphasis on sharing in their products.</p> <p>\"It could be adapted to share via Facebook, but I'm always very wary of someone who thinks they sound cool,\" says Chilvers, who says he prefers the \"chain-letter\" dynamic of email sharing, where recipients who open the scapes can immediately start changing the elements.</p> <p>\"I'm tempted to put a poll on our <a href=\"http://generativemusic.com/\">Generative Music website</a> asking two questions: would you like to be able to share your scapes, and do you want to actually receive them?\"</p> <p>While he's talking, though, Eno appears to be having a bit of a lightbulb moment on the other side of the table \u2013&#xa0;albeit not one to be shared with anyone other than Chilvers for now.</p> <p>\"I've had another idea, but I don't want it to be published yet,\" he says. \"Just as we were talking about social media, I suddenly thought 'I've got it! I know what the next thing is'\u2026I've realised it's a very strong idea.\"</p> <p>Which is, at least, another reason why Eno won't be retiring just yet.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Age:</strong> 51.</p> <p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Changeable.</p> <p><strong>The California pop group behind Surfin' USA, I&#xa0;Get Around, Good Vibrations and Help Me, Rhonda?</strong> That's the one.</p> <p><strong>What has happened?

  "<p>This week, GOP vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan topped off a critique of President Obama's response to violent demonstrations at American embassies across the Middle East by saying that because of the president's policies, the Middle East \"looked like 1979 Tehran\" \u2013 when demonstrations by Iranian student revolutionaries culminated in the invasion of the US embassy and the taking of 50 hostages in a stand-off that would endure 444 days. It has become all too easy for opponents of Ryan and his boss, Governor Mitt Romney, to level zingers at their foreign policy bloopers, and I had mine all ready: all this does is remind us that Ryan, who was born in 1970 and has no national security experience other than, as he has said, \"voting to send our troops to war\", has no idea what happened in Teheran in 1979.</p> <p>But dismissing this soundbite misses the chance to consider two serious assertions that underlie it: first, that what we are seeing in the Middle East right now is a collapse of American policy and interests on a par with how the fall of the Shah and his eventual replacement by a hostile theocracy, the hostage-taking, and the failed rescue effort damaged the US in 1979-80. And second, that it is 1980, \"morning in America\" again, and Mitt Romney is Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama is Jimmy Carter.</p> <p>Take the defeat-and-collapse theory of world affairs first. Romney sounded this call while protesters were still massed in Cairo, Tunis and Khartoum, worrying that violence demonstrated that the Arab Spring would turn into an \"Arab Winter\". <a href=\"http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/09/18/a_tale_of_two_narratives\">Tom Mahnken of Foreign Policy's conservative blog Shadow Government writes</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Regardless of its origins, the ongoing violence is stark testimony to the failure of the outreach to the Muslim world that lay at the heart of Obama's Middle East policy.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/09/24/paul-ryan-turn-on-the-tv-and-it-reminds-you-of-1979-tehran/\">Now comes Paul Ryan equating</a> \"burning our flag in capitals all around the world\" with 1979 in Tehran. A note I can't resist here: I am just two years older than Ryan. In 1979, my middle-school social studies teacher in South Burlington, VT, decided it was important we learn about what was going on in Iran, even if we hadn't the slightest idea why it was happening, or what it had to do with us. So I can still rattle off names like Shahpour Bakhtiar, briefly prime minister between the Shah's overthrow and the ayatollahs' ascension. I'd be delighted to learn that Ryan has similar memories.</p> <p>But for those of you who stuck with the regular curriculum, or were still watching Sesame Street, let's compare and contrast then and now:</p> <p><strong>1979:</strong> A key US regional ally, held in place with US military and economic support, is overthrown, leaving an enormous hole in US Middle East policy.</p> <p><strong>2012:</strong> No governments are overthrown; several governments restate their commitment to improved ties with the US.</p> <p><strong>1979:</strong> A specific US decision \u2013 admitting the deposed Shah for medical treatment \u2013 enrages Iranians across the political spectrum.</p> <p><strong>2012:</strong> A noxious video clip with no connection to the US government enrages Muslims, generating small demonstrations a fraction of the size of those in recent years.</p> <p><strong>1979:</strong> An interim government that is angry at US policies but seeking democracy and broad ties with the world is overthrown by radicals, empowered among other forces by anti-Americanism.</p> <p><strong>2012:</strong> Demonstrations bring out radical forces that seek to challenge governments in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Pakistan. No governments fall. In fact, in one Libyan city, residents band together and drive a radical group out of its headquarters.</p> <p><strong>1979:</strong> The loss of a key US ally, the exposure of the extent of the Shah's violation of his citizens' rights, and perceived US weakness in the hostage-taking and subsequent rescue attempt \u2013 plus the installation of an inward-looking, radical government sustained by anti-Americanism \u2013 has consequences that linger to this day.</p> <p><strong>2012:</strong> <a href=\"http://lynch.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/09/17/the_embassy_protests_and_the_arab_uprising\">Analyst Marc Lynch writes:</a></p> <blockquote> <p>\"The end of this crisis matters more than the beginning \u2026 America navigating this turbulent environment will depend in part on bipartisan consensus about the importance of promoting democratic reform in the Arab world. The Obama administration has maintained its poise through a difficult week, despite the crisis abroad and the partisan polemics at home.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As in 1979, Americans must learn all over again that we do not control the pace or direction of events in the Middle East. But unlike the downward spiral of 1979, we have not lost all capacity to influence \u2013 and the governments of the region, despite considerable public anger, have not lost interest in working with us.</p> <p>Why would Romney and Ryan, who say again and again that they want more US engagement for economic and political freedom in the Middle East, dabble in a narrative that says all is lost there?</p> <p>This brings us to the second dynamic underlying Ryan's apparently casual comment. Since the summer, Romney's campaign and <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/09/13/1980_watch_its_obama_is_carter_day_for_right_wing_press/\">its cheerleaders</a> have tried to fit this election into a Carter-Reagan narrative. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/03/us-usa-campaign-idUSBRE83Q1DF20120503\">Romney has called Obama</a> \"the most anti-small business president I've seen probably since Carter\". <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/romney-obama-worse-than-jimmy-carter/\">Killing Osama bin Laden</a>? \"Even Jimmy Carter would have given that order.\" Romney's struggle to gain a lead in the polls? <a href=\"http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/08/09/what-really-happened-in-the-1980-presidential-campaign/\">Like Reagan</a>. (<a href=\"http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/08/09/what-really-happened-in-the-1980-presidential-campaign/\">Or not</a>.)</p> <p>Political scientists note that US elections are more polarized now than they were then, and that Carter at the time was a more beloved figure, even among those who did not vote for him, then either Obama or Romney is now. And it hardly needs saying that Reagan's charm and political skills are lacking this cycle. So the good news, surprisingly, comes from the Middle East: it's not 1979. Or 2006, when the Bush administration faced widespread and ugly protests, put down by our undemocratic allies, over Danish cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed \u2013 and a Palestinian election that didn't produce the results they'd hoped for.</p> <p>Arguably, there is no moment like this in Middle Eastern history. If it's too much to hope that such a realization, which clearly animated the life of Ambassador Chris Stevens and his colleagues, transcends American politics, at least we might expect that our parties would compete to see who can get it right \u2013 rather than pre-emptively declare that it has all gone wrong.</p>",

Lebedev said the move to charge him was designed to silence a tycoon who has become increasingly critical of the rampant corruption of the regime of Vladimir Putin and its powerful security services.</p> <p>Prosecutors opened an investigation into Lebedev nearly one year ago after he punched Sergei Polonsky, a property developer, during the filming of a television programme for the state-run channel NTV. In a heated discussion on the financial crisis, Lebedev, a 52-year-old former KGB agent, jumped out of his chair and flew at Polonsky, knocking him to the ground. Lebedev insisted he was provoked. \"I think it was a trap from the beginning,\" he told the Guardian.</p> <p>The charges against Lebedev come amidst a wider crackdown as Putin attempts to defuse the growing opposition against him.</p> <p>Lebedev is part owner, alongside former Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev, of Novaya Gazeta, the country's leading opposition and investigative newspaper. He has also recently aligned himself with Alexey Navalny, the de facto leader of Russia's protest movement and a prominent anti-corruption crusader.</p> <p>\"My father has been targeted because of his determination to fight against corruption and to be a crusader for democracy in a country where this has not always been welcome,\" Lebedev's son Evgeny, chairman of his UK media holdings, said in a statement.</p> <p>The elder Lebedev said he had long been the target of the authorities' ire but attempts to pressure him had recently increased. Lebedev's National Reserve Bank is under investigation after being raided by masked armed men, and he insists video and audio surveillance of his homes and businesses have been boosted, while a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/29/alexander-lebedev-business-russia?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">sex tape was leaked onto the internet this summer</a>.</p> <p>\"They are hoping I will leave the country,\" Lebedev said. \"It's a standard procedure: first they go against your business, then second is a smear campaign and third is the most threatening weapon \u2013 first the threat of prison and then, if you don't emigrate, you go to trial on some fabricated case.\"</p> <p>The hooliganism charge against Lebedev is the same one levelled against the anti-Kremlin punk band Pussy Riot, three of whose members have been jailed for two years after being found guilty of \"hooliganism motivated by religious hatred\" for performing an anti-Putin song in a Moscow cathedral. The criminal code article levied against the band includes \"political, ideological, racial, ethnic or religious hatred\". Lebedev has been charged with \"hooliganism motivated by political hatred\", according to a copy of the charges the tycoon posted on his website.</p> <p>\"I'm not a politician, [Polonsky] isn't a politician \u2013 what is political hatred?\" Lebedev said, calling the charge \"complete nonsense\".</p> <p>Lebedev insisted he was not funding the opposition that emerged in Russia after Putin announced his intention to return to the presidency late last year. But his National Reserve Bank has agreed to put out a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/11/alexander-lebedev-russian-corruption-internet?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">debit card that will see a part of all expenditures donated to Navalny's anti-corruption project, RosPil</a>. Navalny has also recently taken a seat on the board of Aeroflot, in which Lebedev owns a 15% stake. Navalny has been charged with economic crimes and faces up to 10 years in prison if found guilty.</p> <p>Yet Lebedev pointed to his ownership of Novaya Gazeta, which has seen several of its journalists killed for their hard-hitting investigative reporting into corruption and human rights abuses, as the reason for the campaign against him.</p> <p>When asked if he thought Putin had been directly involved in his case, he declined to point directly point the finger but said: \"They definitely know everything. There is no possibility to go behind somebody's back. The system is tightly controlled.\"</p> <p>The investigation into Lebedev's punch-up was opened days after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/oct/04/alexander-lebedev-charged-hooliganism-chatshow\" title=\"\">Putin publicly called the incident \"hooliganism\"</a>.</p> <p>Oligarchs in Russia were sent a strong signal not to dabble in politics with the 2003 arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man as the head of the oil company Yukos, now bankrupted. Khodorkovsky was jailed on charges of fraud and tax evasion in a case government critics say was launched to punish him for funding the Russian opposition without Kremlin approval.</p> <p>Lebedev acknowledged that he could fall prey to Russia's notoriously politicised justice system. \"This is not a case where law, rule of law, prevails,\" he said. Asked if he was ready to go to prison, he said: \"I don't think anyone can be ready for that, especially someone with a family\".</p> <p>Polonsky, a formerly successful property developer who suffered greatly during the financial crisis of 2008, could not be reached for comment. Russian media reported he was in Cambodia and on the verge of selling his heavily indebted business. He had tried to reach an out of court settlement with Lebedev, the media tycoon said.</p> <p>Lebedev's laywer, Henry Reznik, said the charges were designed to sow fear. They come as the Russian parliament debates a host of new laws \u2013 including fines for treason and insulting religious feelings \u2013 that critics say are designed to clamp down on the growing opposition. The parliament has already passed a raft of new laws targeting illegal protests, NGOs and the internet. An opposition deputy, Gennady Gudkov, has been stripped of his mandate, and more than a dozen people face criminal charges for a protest that turned violent in May.</p> <p>Lebedev declined to comment directly on why the charges were coming now, but noted that he had been co-owned of Novaya Gazeta for seven years. \"Why would they tolerate it for so long?

But they did not file any other charges, contrary to <a href=\"http://www.citypress.co.za/Politics/News/Breaking-Arrest-warrant-issued-for-Malema-20120921\" title=\"\">media reports</a> that he also faced trial for fraud and corruption. Malema was given 10,000 rand bail after the 10-minute hearing.</p> <p>Wearing a grey suit, white shirt and red tie, he emerged confidently from court into the sunshine of Polokwane, in his home province of Limpopo, to address around 1,000 cheering supporters. Malema mocked the president, Jacob Zuma, as \"illiterate\" and called for him to be ousted and charged with corruption himself.</p> <p>\"I'm here because some people have taken a decision to conspire against me and bring some charges,\" the 31-year-old said into a microphone. \"When I came here I was told that I'm going to be charged with corruption, fraud and money laundering, which are serious crimes&#xa0;\u2026 On my arrival here I was told that: 'We actually have one charge against you, and that charge is money laundering.' It falls under 'schedule 1', which is not very serious charges.\"</p> <p>The crowd erupted in applause and shouting. Malema continued: \"I said to them I have nothing to hide; I've never been part of any criminal activity, I will never be part of any criminal activity.</p> <p>\"I'm not corrupt and I do not engage in fraudulent activities. What you see is what you get. And today they have proved it, that they do not have a case of corruption against me, they do not have a case of fraud against me. They are trying to get something against me.\"</p> <p>Malema claims the charges are politically motivated at a time of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/18/south-african-miners-julius-malema\" title=\"\">labour unrest in South Africa's mining industry</a>. He was expelled from the ANC earlier this year for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/01/anc-african-national-congress-southafrica\" title=\"\">indiscipline and sowing disunity</a>, but has returned from the political wilderness with a vengeance.</p> <p>He said of the police investigators: \"They are sent by Jacob Zuma because Jacob Zuma knows nothing.\"</p> <p>Malema prompted laughter by parodying Zuma in the president's first language, Zulu, then in English: \"Just arrest him!\" \"What did he do?\" \"Just arrest him for anything!\"</p> <p>Referring to the president's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/apr/06/zuma-corruption-charges-dropped?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">own courtroom battles before his election</a>, Malema added: \"Zuma had 700 charges against him. I have got one charge against me.\"</p> <p>Malema's four business associates also appeared in court on charges including fraud, corruption and money laundering in connection with the 52m (\u00a33.9m) rand government tender awarded to the company On Point Engineering \u2013 in which Malema owns shares through his family trust \u2013 for road services in Limpopo province. They were granted a bail of 40,000 rand (\u00a33,003) each.</p> <p>Malema claimed they were being unfairly penalised. He warned the crowd: \"All of you are going to be punished for being here because in South Africa, a banana republic, being next to Julius Malema is a criminal offence. You get charged for that.</p> <p>\"These charges which they brought against me, they will not affect me in any way. I'm unshaken, I'm not intimidated by nonsense, I will continue with the struggle for economic freedom. They are wasting time.\"</p> <p>Malema announced that on Thursday he will go to another mine in the platinum belt to encourage workers to demand a pay rise. He repeated his call for change at the ANC's internal election in December in Mangaung. \"You must make sure Jacob Zuma does not become the president of the ANC. The following day we remove him as a president, the day after we charge him with corruption, because Zuma has never been charged.</p> <p>\"Inside the court we are not going to say our charges must be dropped. We are saying to the court: 'We have presented ourselves, we are ready to answer every question,' because we are not hiding anything.</p> <p>\"We are not like the head of state in South Africa who runs away from the court and calls for Umshini Wami [Zuma's trademark song, meaning \"Bring me my machine gun\"]. We don't want Umshini Wami, we want a laptop and iPad so that we can prepare our answers to the court. That's who we are. We are law-abiding South Africans. We are not scared of the court. Only the crooks, only criminals, will run away from the court.\"</p> <p>Earlier, scores of police deployed razor wire to block hundreds of Malema supporters, many waving placards that read: \"Hands off our leader\", from entering the police station and court. Vigils were held through the night for him, where supporters sang songs against Zuma.</p> <p>Last week, police surrounded Malema and threatened his arrest when he arrived at a stadium to address striking mine workers who were meeting to vote on a wage deal. Malema was forced to leave before addressing the crowd of thousands.</p> <p>He is due to reappear in court on 30 November. If convicted, Malema could reportedly face a fine of up to 100m rand or a maximum 30 years in jail.</p> <p>The self-proclaimed economic freedom fighter's taste for luxury cars, expensive Swiss watches and champagne parties has also attracted the attention of South Africa's revenue service, <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2012-09-23-sars-says-malema-owes-r16m-in-tax\" title=\"\">which said at the weekend</a> he owed 16m rand (\u00a31.2m) in unpaid taxes.</p>",

They're not quite as krautrocky as Warpaint, and describe what they do as \"psychedelic gospel\".

  "<p>Oh, calamity! I've been for my regular eye check and I need varifocals. It's the beginning of the end, I tell you. On the other hand, I was given a wonderful opportunity to crash the opticians and try on all the frames, because if I'm going to have something stuck on my face for a good proportion of the day I'm going to be damn sure it suits me. It's tricky, though, finding the time to devote to this quest, especially when it's a journey fraught with the embarrassment you feel when trying on things that quite honestly look bloody comical until you hit on the Right Ones.</p> <p>There aren't very many of us who get to my age (polite cough) and don't need glasses for something or other \u2013 say, reading or driving. I'm kind of stuck because I've got the usual age-related long-sighted thing happening as well as a problem with distance and depth perception. For example, I can see that there is a window but I have trouble gauging exactly where it is because I have double astigmatism. It's the same with mirrors, tennis balls, washing lines, gateposts, people, the ground. My life is a long sequence of falling over and into things, either independently or in a car and occasionally on a bicycle. Without glasses I feel very much taller than 5ft 2in, with glasses the ground snaps into focus and I'm much closer to it than I thought I was. To be honest, I prefer looking at things in soft focus, especially my face in a mirror, but it's probably better that I don't take my life in my hands quite so often on escalators and stairs.</p> <p>I'd left my eye check for longer than usual because I really couldn't be arsed, but then I noticed that small print was getting even smaller and I couldn't read the reheating instructions on my M&amp;S cottage pie. I bought a thumping great magnifying glass, which is a very pleasing thing to use at home but not much help out there in the big fuzzy world. When I kept getting eyestrain after a day in front of a computer screen I decided I couldn't put it off any longer. And anyway, it's one of those important checks to make sure all is well and that's usually fine but sometimes picks up the beginnings of something that can be treated.</p> <p>So, it turns out that instead of having two pairs of specs balanced on my head I can have one pair for everything but they come with that dreaded tag I will forever associate with lavender-haired ladies in crocheted cardigans \u2013 varifocals. Varifocals take a bit of getting used to (my optician says to give it at least three weeks), but it's worth asking if your optician has a refund/exchange period. Specs are an expensive piece of kit, most of the cost being in the lenses. Then there's the awkward business of choosing the frames. This is when you need someone with a good eye (no pun intended) whose opinion you trust. I've now learned that because my face is getting longer (something to do with gravity?), and I can't take a frame with too much below the eye because I look like a horse. What I can take is a natty pair of horn-rims because they tilt upwards and lift my face. I also find that the best way to try on is without makeup, because you get a much cleaner impression of how the frames sit on your face. And if they look good without makeup, they'll look 10 times better with it.</p> <p>In the end I went with the very first pair that caught my eye (enough with the puns now, promise). They're a purple and green <a href=\"http://www.anneetvalentin.com/\" title=\"\">\"retro chic\" pair from Anne et Valentin</a>. It took me an hour to decide and I tried on virtually everything else, but isn't that always the way?</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Invisible Woman on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/TheVintageYear\" title=\"\">Twitter @TheVintageYear</a></p>",
  "<p>Liberal Democrats have told their leadership to oppose the coalition's plans to relax planning laws and thereby allow people to build extensions to their homes without planning permission.</p> <p>The party's Brighton conference overwhelmingly backed a motion to oppose the government plans, which include letting homeowners build extensions of up to 25ft in their gardens and make it easier to build conservatories without planning permission.</p> <p>Delegates argued that the government proposals, meant to promote growth, were contrary to the party's commitment to localism and the Localism Act 2011, and failed to address the real reason why homes were not being built.</p> <p>Votes at the Lib Dem conference set party policy but not coalition policy, and are not binding on Liberal ministers. However, it will put pressure on them to return to Westminster and seek concessions.</p> <p>After the vote Don Foster, the Lib Dem communities minister, said the consultation on the plan would continue.</p> <p>\"The planning regulations proposals are accompanied by an extra \u00a3300m to ensure a significant increase in social housing,\" he said. \"The increase in building will be a significant boost to the local economy. We are now consulting on how the planning regulations will work in practice and we will be listening to the views expressed today by conference, which will form an important part of this process.\"</p> <p>Foster was the only speaker to oppose the motion. Only three delegates voted in favour of the government's plans.</p> <p>One councillor, Catherine Smart of Cambridge, said: \"This proposal will not help growth, it will not speed up construction. It will actually slow it down. You just wonder what planet some of these people are on.</p> <p>\"Just for once, these parliamentarians should listen to the little people on the district councils who actually know most about this. Just listen to them and take these stupid ideas away.\"</p> <p>Prue Bray, from Wokingham, Berkshire, said: \"This is not the first coalition policy forced on the party. We know in coalition we cannot have everything we want. We understand the need for confidentiality in government. But surely it is not beyond us as a party to come up with a better way for the party and parliamentarians to work together so we can avoid situations like this?\"</p> <p>The motion called on the coalition to withdraw its proposals, stating that the Lib Dems believed that current planning laws were \"not the reason for a failure to proceed with existing approved housing developments\", that \"these proposals go against the spirit of the Localism Act 2011, which encourages more local control of planning policies\" and \"that these proposals ignore local democracy, will fail to protect local communities and will encourage more neighbourhood disputes\".</p>",

  "<p>Hmm, I think that's summer officially over with, then (I'm gazing out over a very grey Colchester skyline). I bit the bullet and lit my fire last night, too, and we've just had to shut all the office windows as it's blowing an absolute hoolie outside.<br> Never mind. Veg, thankfully, are much hardier than us. So while it may seem as if it's time to shut up shop on the edible garden, there are some easy ways to extend the growing season and ensure fresh pickings well into winter. Of course, I should start out by saying that we've got stalwart winter crops like robust, crinkly kales and savoys and steel-like leeks as the backbone of the cold-season garden. But there are ways to partner these old favourites with less likely candidates if you apply a bit of savvy \u2013 here's how: <strong>Cloches</strong><br>These are cheap, simple and invaluable \u2013 I use loads of them on my plot in autumn and winter. Mine are fashioned out of rigid wire mesh tunnels draped in a double layer of thick horticultural fleece (weigh this down with large stones or bricks) and are ideal for long rows of veg (you can buy them, too, if bending wire and folding fleece isn't your thing). Polythene isn't as insulating and it also doesn't allow for good air flow, so avoid it if you can. Laid over rows of summer-sown carrots, baby turnips, beetroot, kohl rabi, swede, celeriac, winter-hardy salad leaves and Swiss chard, it will encourage growth to tick along at the slowest of paces. As a consequence, your veg will remain small, tender and perfectly fresh. A midwinter layer of insulating snow over the top isn't a bad thing if your tunnel supports are up to it. Slug and snail damage will be minimal, as temperatures are too cold for their activity. <strong>Greenhouses</strong><br>If you have one of these, you're a lucky so and so, because it opens up the window to extensive winter growing. OK, so the cost of fuel may be prohibitive and you'll need to weigh up the economics of the situation. Electric \"fuel\" is preferable, as no fumes or water vapours are given off. The hotter you can heat your house, the more varied the crops you can grow. This could be excellent for ripening up the last few tomatoes and peppers, or any potted tender crops. No heating needn't be an issue, though, as you're essentially left with one huge cloche. Line this with bubble plastic and you'll have the ideal winter salad growing environment. Think rocket, mizuna, mustard, leaf radish, beetroot (leaves), chard, chicory, endive, hardy lettuce, turnip tops, land cress, par cel, radicchio \u2013 germinate in trays indoors to get them going, then move them to your greenhouse. Position them in the middle of the house and off the floor to access the warmest parts. <strong>Storing in the ground</strong><br>Just a quick note on this \u2013 most of us are familiar with the recommendation to leave parsnips in the soil, because a frost transforms some of the starches into sweeter substances. It also stops roots withering. Thin-skinned parsnips, celeriac and Jerusalem artichokes are better left in the soil until you want to eat them, as they risk drying out if lifted. \"Clamps\" are an old-fashioned way around this, because if your ground is frozen solid then you can't easily lift the crops. A modern-day clamp could be a box of damp sand in your shed or garage (line the base and sides with fine chicken wire to obstruct hungry rodents). Use it for the above crops, and larger beetroot, turnips and swedes. <strong>Freezing</strong><br>Of course you can always rely on your freezer to preserve your veg for winter. Calabrese, peas, spinach, runner beans \u2013 all these and more summer surpluses can be frozen. Two key points: get the veg to freezing point as quickly as possible (this results in smaller ice crystals and thereby preserves the texture) and blanch larger vegetables first to conserve their vibrant colour. There's loads on information on this on the internet, so check for specific blanching times for your particular crop.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Lucy Halsall is the editor of <a href=\"http://www.growfruitandveg.co.uk/magazine/\">Grow Your Own magazine</a>, which contains a wealth of information about growing your own vegetables.

  "<p>The police marksman who shot Mark Duggan dead has testified for the first time in public and said he had \"absolutely no doubt\" that the suspect was preparing to raise a handgun he was clutching and open fire on officers surrounding him.</p> <p>The officer, known only as V53, said his substantive account of the shooting was compiled three days later, with he and his colleagues spending more than eight hours sitting in a room together writing their statements. </p> <p>He said they were aware of the rules about officers conferring and had discussed the incident among themselves, then wrote their statements.</p> <p>The police marksman denied there was a shoot-to-kill policy, saying he wanted to \"neutralise\" the threat Duggan posed and stop him. He told a jury that after firing two shots, Duggan fell to the floor but he was unable to see the gun, which he said was later recovered nearby.</p> <p>The shooting of Duggan on 4 August 2011 in Tottenham, north London, triggered riots that spread across the capital and to other cities.</p> <p>The firearms officer was giving evidence at the trial of the man accused of supplying the gun to Duggan. The accused, Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, denies handing over the gun just 15 minutes before Duggan was confronted by police and shot.</p> <p>Speaking from behind a screen, the police marksman told a jury at Snaresbrook crown court in east London: \"Mark Duggan was holding a handgun in his right hand. He was holding the pistol grip or the handle of the gun. I could make out the shape and outline of the gun. I could make out the trigger guard.\" </p> <p>He said the gun was covered by a sock and he could make out the gun barrel.</p> <p>Duggan had been followed by covert officers as he travelled to east London to allegedly pick up a weapon. </p> <p>As the taxi reached Ferry Lane in Tottenham, the officer said the order was heard over the radio, \"strike, strike, strike\", meaning police in unmarked cars were to force the vehicle carrying Duggan to stop. The marksman said Duggan came out of the taxi at speed.</p> <p>V53 said armed officers shouted \"armed police\" and \"stand still\" at Duggan. He did not comply, the jury was told.</p> <p>V53 said: \"As I shouted 'armed police', Mark Duggan has turned to face me.\" The officer said Duggan was holding the gun at the level of his stomach: \"The only way I can describe it&#xa0;\u2026 is as an 'oh fuck' moment. He has got a gun and he is going to use it on me.\" </p> <p>He said Duggan was moving the barrel away from his body, into the \"aim position\". Armed with an MP5 sub-machine gun, the officer said he shot Duggan in the chest to stop him, not to kill him: \"I had an honest held belief that Mark Duggan was going to shoot me or one of my colleagues.\"</p> <p>After the first shot Duggan made a \"flinching movement\" but still had the gun in his right hand and V53 fired again, striking Duggan in the right bicep.</p> <p>Duggan fell to the floor. Another officer shouted: \"I'm hit, I'm hit,\" after a ricochet from his colleague struck him. The police-issue bullet struck his radio.</p> <p>Before the jury, V53 stressed his certainty of the key aspect of his account, saying he had \"absolutely no doubt\" and was 100% sure Duggan was holding a gun when challenged by police.</p> <p>Questioned by Stuart Denney QC for the defence, V53 said he was taken away from the scene in a car that contained colleagues and a representative from the Police Federation \u2013 the body that represents rank and file officers.</p> <p>Three days after the shooting V53 and 10 colleagues were shown into a room, where they made written statements.</p> <p>V53 said by this stage he had already given two short accounts.</p> <p>On 7 August, V53 said, before he and his colleagues entered the room, they were reminded by a manager about the rules on conferring.</p> <p>The officers entered the room at midday and finished at 8.40pm.</p> <p>V53 said the officers had followed the rules on making statements after a shooting, which had been agreed by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.</p> <p>V53 said: \"One of the things we were not allowed to discuss was why I opened fire. That was my decision and my decision alone. \"</p> <p>He said this was to be the biggest statement he had ever made and he wanted to get it right.</p> <p>V53 said he and the 10 other officers would discuss events, broken down into sections, then write that part down in their statement: \"We would discuss it and keep writing as we went along.\"</p> <p>The officer added: \"I have nothing to hide. I want to be accountable for my actions.\"</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>",
  "<p>Search engines, in the most simple of explanations, query databases with the purpose of finding the best match to that query. It is a mathematical relationship that goes: if search query equals A then return B. The mistake many make is that they think search engine optimisation is a practice limited to websites and search portals such as Google. It isn't. Search engine optimisation involves convincing a search engine that a particular database entry should appear as B.</p> <p>Matt Owen talks about how the latest Google products (Google Glasses and Google Now) and mobile devices will deliver the \"killer blow to SEO\". I find this to be short-sighted and disagree with the premise that services such as Google Now are \"not search in any way, shape or form\".</p> <p>At the moment search is a three way interaction. A \"searcher\" enters their query into a search engine; the search engine consults a database and returns the best match. Products such as Google Now will not change the interaction between search engine and database, they will simply remove the need for the searcher to be involved in this transaction.</p> <p>Google Now is a service designed to make suggestions and provide you with information before you ask for it. It will do this by profiling the user. Mobile devices already transmit and record huge swathes of data about you and as mobile use expands so too will the information about you that is held upon these databases. For Google Now to provide you with information you want, it will need to consult these databases, build a profile of you and provide the best match to your profile.</p> <p>More importantly and as I mentioned earlier, search is not a process that limits itself to the website/search portal relationship. Mobile use has reduced, and may well continue to reduce, the number of interactions between the portal and the user, but services such as Foursquare and business directories rely on search to provide the user with the best match to their query. Where there is an option to search there is opportunity to be found, but you need to make sure you are optimised to be seen. The old technique of changing your business name to, for example, AAA Taxis in order to top the Yellow Pages listings is a perfect example of search optimisation in action.</p> <h2>Google doesn't control me </h2> <p>Putting aside the fact search is not limited to Google and its many portals, there is another consideration to be taken into account. I have free will. I may not want to do it the Google or Bing way. The need for my interaction might diminish or be removed, but it does not mean that I will stop interacting or indeed stop searching.</p> <p>I don't disagree with all that Matt said in his article; I simply disagree with the idea that changing technologies and habits will spell the end for the search optimisation industry.</p> <p>What would happen to competitiveness and variation if optimisation and choice were removed? Will life become one of stagnation and indifference, as Google continually serves up the same information over and over, day after day? What space is there for competition if Google creates a situation where you never have opportunity to try and find something new? For that matter, what future is there for Google if they, a search engine, stop providing variation and choice?</p> <p>The SEO industry will not die. Not while there are a) digital landscapes b) options and c) people to use and search for them. Of course there will be change, but then every industry changes. What remains is that there will always be a need for search; and if it can be searched, it can be optimised.</p> <p><em>Chris Pitt is a campaign delivery manager for <a href=\"http://www.verticalleap.co.uk/\">Vertical Leap</a>.</em></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/media-network/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> of the Guardian Media Network.

  "<p>Until the second world war, most British medieval historians avoided cultural history, remaining more concerned with the church, government or the law; institutions and politics. Except for the literate pious, what might have made medieval people tick was treated as self-evident, immaterial or unknowable. In the subsequent revolution of approaches, Maurice Keen, who has died aged 78, played a seminal role, even if his unshakable modesty would probably have denied it.</p> <p>His major book, Chivalry (1984), which won the Wolfson prize that year, remains one of the great works of history in English of the past 70 years, comparable with such landmarks as his old tutor Richard Southern's The Making of the Middle Ages or Peter Brown's The World of Late Antiquity. After Chivalry, no one could look at Keen's subject, the knightly life, unaffected by his comprehensive and nuanced exposition of the nature and significance of the culture of those who ruled western Europe for half a millennium.</p> <p>Keen demonstrated that chivalry existed as a serious feature of medieval politics, religion, nobility and society, not an exotic distraction. Using a vast array of literary, visual, legal, academic and archival evidence, he dismantled the then prevalent view associated with the Dutch cultural historian Johan Huizinga that chivalry was a decadent expression of the waning of the middle ages.</p> <p>In studies produced over 40 years, he revealed the practical importance of chivalric ideals and institutions such as tournaments, dubbing, orders of chivalry and heraldry. His analytical ear was pitch-perfect in defining chivalry's implications as \"tonal rather than precise\".</p> <p>Such subtlety was evident in his doctoral thesis, supervised by the redoubtable Bruce McFarlane, published as The Laws of War in the Late Middle Ages (1965), a virtuoso piece of mature scholarship that demonstrated how the law of arms, while reflecting the international freemasonry of chivalry, was actively employed in regulating how wars were fought, a legacy that fed subsequent theories of international law. Connecting the medieval past with later social developments remained a notable aspect of Keen's work, as in his last important work, The Origins of the English Gentleman (2002), which delicately traced how, between 1300 and 1500, the warrior knight transmogrified into the aristocratic gentleman.</p> <p>In studying the prevalent relationship between religion, war and the warrior ethos, Keen unravelled with enormous subtlety the layers of clerical and religious influence on a mode of living which he argued was essentially a secular code of honour derived from military practices. He admitted to having been drawn to his subject by a childish fascination with knights in shining armour and his empathy with them led some critics to argue that he turned a blind eye to their darker aspects. In fact, Keen's work shows acute awareness of the fragility of conventions, of the evolution of cultural norms and of human weakness. He did not seek to construct an apologia.</p> <p>In pioneering a radical reassessment of knightly values, Keen brought to bear his early enthusiasm for knightly literature, which found precocious expression in his first book, The Outlaws of Medieval England (1961). Many of his sharper insights were derived from subjecting a literary stereotype, such as brothers-in-arms or Chaucer's Knight, to forensic examination by archival sources. Increasingly, he incorporated a sensitive exploitation of visual culture, not then so obvious a resource of historical evidence as it is today. Beside his work on chivalry, Keen also produced three general works, A History of Medieval Europe (1968), England in the Later Middle Ages (1973), and English Society in the Later Middle Ages (1990), which revealed his range and ability at lucid historical synthesis.</p> <p>Yet his outstanding scholarly distinction, recognised by the Royal Historical Society's Alexander prize medal in 1961 and his election to fellowships of the Society of Antiquaries (1987) and the British Academy (1990), formed only part of a deeply fulfilled academic life.</p> <p>Born in London, Keen came from Anglo-Irish stock. His father was Keeper of the University Chest at Oxford and a fellow of Balliol College, his mother a talented painter. He attended Winchester college, where the headteacher, Walter Oakeshott, turned his thoughts seriously to medieval knights. His national service was spent in the Royal Ulster Fusiliers before he went to Balliol in 1954.</p> <p>A stellar undergraduate career was capped with a first in 1957 and a junior research fellowship at the Queen's College (1957-61) before he returned to Balliol, succeeding Southern as fellow and tutor in medieval history (1961-2000). Keen became a legendary tutor, one of the few to be portrayed in his own guise in popular fiction, the \"semi-collapsed upholstery\" of his room and a tutorial on Jan Hus appearing in Frederick Forsyth's The Negotiator (1989).</p> <p>Keen enjoyed the company of young people upon whom he expended seemingly limitless reserves of sympathy, patience and friendship. He did not regard research and teaching as hostile competitors. In 2004 he was appointed OBE.</p> <p>In many ways he shared the values of the knights he studied \u2013 loyalty, duty, service, generosity \u2013 and showed these were by no means redundant. Possessed of indelible charm, with an advanced sense and capacity for enjoyment and fun, Keen was also a private man, most content exploring the ways of fish in quiet streams and enjoying his family, the centre of his happiness.</p> <p>In 1968 he married Mary Keegan. She and their three daughters survive him.</p> <p>\u2022 Maurice Hugh Keen, medieval historian, born 30 October 1933; died 11 September 2012</p>",
  "<p>The Palestinian finance minister recently warned that the two-state solution would be in crisis unless the Palestinian Authority (PA) immediately received more funds.</p> <p>\"The two state solution is in jeopardy if the PA is not able to continue to function,\" Nabeel Kassis <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/palestinians-say-two-state-solution-jeopardy#overlay-context=article/hurricane-miriam-forms-pacific-ocean-0\">said</a>.</p> <p>But Kassis was talking about an imaginary state, one largely funded by international donors. The World Bank announced last week that \"sustainable economic growth\" was impossible while Israel continued to <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/world-bank-palestinian-fiscal-crisis-deepening-17267951#.UGC-y6Rcsug\">control</a> vast swathes of the West Bank.</p> <p>Large <a href=\"http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2012/Sep-07/187137-fayyad-under-fire-as-palestinian-protests-fill-streets.ashx\">protests</a> against the PA by Palestinians indicates growing unrest over rising prices and the failure to realise any tangible political moves towards independence. This is why growing numbers of Palestinians under occupation are talking about adopting the one-state solution and pressuring their leaders to <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/04/12/150447864/one-state-idea-gains-support-of-some-palestinians\">follow</a>.</p> <p>\"The idea of one state is about \u2026 breaking apart the system of privilege that exists and being able to live as an equal,\" says Diana Buttu, a former legal adviser to the Palestinian negotiating team and contributor to a book I have just co-edited, <a href=\"http://mondoweiss.net/2012/08/discussing-life-after-zionism-in-israelpalestine.html\">After Zionism</a>.</p> <p>During a recent visit, I heard many Palestinians say that the two-state solution was barely discussed seriously in Palestinian circles, but that the PA, currently too reliant on western support not to continue the fiction of state-building, as yet persists in believing in its inevitability. The status quo is beginning to crumble, though, with senior PA officials now talking about abandoning the two-state idea and pushing for a one-state equation. Hamas concurs. This will only grow.</p> <p>The real issue in the Israel/Palestine conflict is barely mentioned in this American election cycle; the obsession with Iran has seen to that. Yet, it is increasingly addressed in public debates, opinion pieces and among both the Jewish and Arab communities that it is time to end the two-state industry. Nearly 20 years after the Oslo process, there are now up to 700,000 Jewish colonists living illegally in the West Bank. A just partition of the land, with a Palestinian right of return, is impossible. It is for this reason, among others, that a one-state solution is <a href=\"http://mondoweiss.net/2012/09/slater-takes-on-one-state-scenarios-from-mearsheimer-munayyer-and-walt.html\">gaining traction</a>, even within conservative circles. </p> <p>Liberal Jews in the United States, firm believers in justice and human rights, are especially conflicted. The controversy surrounding writer Peter Beinart's <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/21/peter-beinart-israel_n_1616738.html\">recent book</a>, The Crisis of Zionism, encapsulated their growing unease with blindly supporting the Jewish state, the occupation and a two-state solution \u2013 all once an article of faith. As Yousef Munayyer, a Palestinian American, recently wrote, to blogger Jerome Slater:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"If the two-state outcome is exposed for fantasy, and Palestinians en masse demand civil rights, it is hard to see a sustained, western objection.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And among the \"non-objection\" camp would be many American Jews. Demographically, the two US groups most committed to maintaining the occupation are Christian evangelicals and Orthodox Jews. If a significant number of American Jews start peeling away from the US pro-Israel lobby, breaking with the tradition of pressuring the US Congress to back every Israeli policy, the Jewish state would potentially face economic crisis.</p> <p>The challenges are profound \u2013 not least unwinding two decades of Oslo propaganda that dictates the two-state solution as the sole answer \u2013 but there are growing calls to imagine what a democratic, secular state in the Middle East might look like. </p> <p>The effect of the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movements in the <a href=\"http://jewishvoiceforpeace.org/blog/los-angeles-activists-put-veolias-complicity-with-israels-human-righ-0\">US</a>, <a href=\"http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/will-other-countries-follow-norway-bans-tax-deductions-donations-israeli\">Europe</a> and around the world, combined with a rise in Jewish fundamentalism in Israel, which is animated against both Palestinians and Africans, the logic of a democratic, one-state solution seems more desirable and less utopian by the day. A plan for its implementation \u2013 a state promising justice for all of its citizens: Jews, Muslims, Christians or atheists \u2013 is already being <a href=\"http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=522430\">mapped out</a>.</p> <p>The US political establishment largely backs the perpetuation of the two-state charade \u2013 witness former State Department official Aaron David Miller <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/07/16/five_reasons_why_the_two_state_solution_won_t_die\">writing</a> a few months ago that this outcome is the \"only game in town\" \u2013 but the unpredictability of today's Arab world means that alternative ideas have a chance to gain traction. Israel's ability to control events on the ground in the West Bank and Gaza is shifting, not least due to Egypt's new-found assertiveness.</p> <p>There has never been serious international pressure to implement a two-state solution; instead, Israeli settlement has been indulged. But moving the one-state idea from the fringes to the mainstream obliges defenders of the current situation to explain their reasoning behind endorsing a so-called solution that entrenches discrimination against Arabs. Now is the time to break open the debate.</p> <p>\u2022 Commenting on this article will be open for 24 hours and may be closed overnight</p>",
  "<p>A campaigning charity has won the right to support the Scottish government in its legal battle with drinks manufacturers that oppose the introduction of minimum pricing.</p> <p>Drinks manufacturers from all over the world are joining in the attempt, led by the Scotch Whisky Association, to derail the Scottish government plans. If they succeed, it will also prevent the introduction of minimum unit pricing in England, which David Cameron has said he favours. The Scottish parliament has passed legislation which would impose a minimum price per unit of alcohol of 50p, increasing the price particularly of cheap spirits sold in supermarkets.</p> <p>Alcohol Focus Scotland was given permission by the court of session in Scotland to back the government by submitting a dossier of evidence on the harm alcohol can do and the positive impact that unit pricing can have on public health. The drinks manufacturers bringing the judicial review have argued there is no such evidence. They opposed the charity's appeal to the court to be allowed to intervene.</p> <p>Dr Evelyn Gillan, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, said it was a tiny organisation compared with the industry juggernaut, but that without its intervention, the court would not hear the health arguments. \"If you add up the members of the three trade groups that are making this legal challenge in the court of session, there are over 100 spirit and wine manufacturers from all over the world, including really big players like Diageo whose profits were \u00a33.2bn last year. We are one small charity.</p> <p>\"The government is going to be arguing the case primarily from the point of view that it is within the competence of the Scottish parliament. We wanted to put the public health evidence before the court because the petitioners are saying there is no evidence. We are saying that is not true.\"</p> <p>It is believed to be the first time that a charity has been given permission for a third-party intervention in the Scottish courts. The court ruled the charity would not have to pay more than its costs.</p> <p>The judicial review at the court of session in Edinburgh will take place at the end of next month. Whichever side loses is likely to take its case to the supreme court. The drinks manufacturers have also lodged a complaint with the European commission.</p> <p>\"Having failed to use their formidable lobbying power to prevent the passage of the minimum pricing law in Scotland, the global corporations now seek to get the legislation struck down by the courts. In taking this action, they follow the well-trodden path of the tobacco industry and other transnational corporations who use their considerable financial clout to oppose public health policies that threaten their shareholders' profits,\" said Gillan.</p> <p>\"In challenging the implementation of minimum pricing, the Scotch Whisky Association is essentially arguing that the commercial interests of its members should take precedence over the health and wellbeing of the people of Scotland. We need to decide if our society is prepared to limit commercial activity to better protect our health and quality of life, or alternatively, allow powerful corporate interests to dictate health policy.\"</p> <p>Significant lobbying has been taking place in Europe, where the European commission has received a complaint from the industry arguing that minimum pricing is unfair and will harm trade.</p> <p>Diageo, which owns Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff and Guinness among other brands, has circulated a study it commissioned to EU officials and member states. The paper, by the Irish economic consultancy Compecon, says the Scottish policy will discriminate against alcoholic drinks imported from other countries in the EU. It says consumers will suffer through the price rise and claims there will be little impact on consumption by harmful and hazardous drinkers. \"Other benefits from reduced crime, unemployment and increased business productivity are also likely to be relatively modest,\" says the paper.</p> <p>Outlining the Scotch Whisky Association's reasons for taking legal action against the government, Gavin Hewitt, the chief executive, said in a statement in July: \"We agree that Scotland must address the harmful use of alcohol, but policy needs to be targeted on the problem. Some 30% of those who drink consume 80% of the alcohol sold. Despite warnings that minimum pricing of alcohol would be illegal, the Scottish government has pressed ahead with its ill-targeted policy and misguided legislation. The Scotch whisky industry is left with no option but to oppose the legislation in Europe and through the Scottish courts.\"</p>",
  "<p><em>'Speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret' \u2013 Ambrose Bierce</em></p> <p>In the week of the anniversary of the Carlos Tevez affair Roberto Mancini found himself in another pickle he could do without. On Tuesday evening the Italian saw his Manchester City side defeated 4-2 at home by Aston Villa in extra-time and knocked out of the Capital One Cup. In a dispatch Mancini may already wish could be expunged he accused rival managers of lacking the bottle to confront Sir Alex Ferguson.</p> <p>Mancini said: \"Every time I say something, they come. After, when they go to Old Trafford, they never say anything. When other managers [at Old Trafford] talk against the referee, they always stay on the bench and say nothing.\"</p> <p>Mancini's ire was provoked by Paul Lambert. The Villa manager believed Mancini had tried to get Joe Bennett booked for a foul on Gareth Barry. \"I am tired with this manager because I didn't say anything,\" the Italian said. \"I asked the fourth official if it was a yellow card without moving my hands. He [Lambert] comes up to me every time but after this some managers go to bigger stadiums and don't say anything. It's better that some managers shut up.\"</p> <p>For Maicon, signed this summer after Mancini managed him at Internazionale to two Serie A winner's medals, the Italian's stance strengthens him. \"Of course the players appreciate when the manager speaks up for the team,\" the right-back says. \"Especially because he puts the pressure on him, rather than giving it to the players.\"</p> <p>Asked if Mancini was combative in Italy, he says: \"He can get passionate but generally speaking he likes to keep quiet and keep the atmosphere around the team calm.\"</p> <p>Yet Lambert joins Tony Pulis, David Moyes, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Kenny Dalglish and Ferguson on the list of those who have had a touchline row with Mancini, who may have been ill-advised to continue the latest one after the match. One can admire Mancini's bravery in raising the old notion of managers genuflecting before Ferguson at Old Trafford but wonder at his strategic wisdom. Taking on the United manager can be a blunder.</p> <p>Roberto Mart\u00ednez and Rafael Ben\u00edtez each tried. Three years ago Mart\u00ednez identified Steve Bruce and Sam Allardyce as Ferguson \"loyalists\" who ganged up on Ben\u00edtez, then the Liverpool manager, and told the Spanish newspaper AS on Sunday: \"He [Ferguson] has a lot of control in this country\", with the Football Association scared to discipline him. True or not, this was hardly politically shrewd in the Premier League village. Cue the Wigan manager \"clarifying\" the comments: \"It is important they all know I was disappointed with the stories that were circulating.\"</p> <p>Ben\u00edtez showed his teeth in the infamous \"facts\" diatribe, also in 2009, when he labelled Ferguson a hypocrite and followed Mart\u00ednez by stating the Scot received preferential treatment from the game's governing bodies. Ben\u00edtez is no longer employed in English football while the Ferguson era at United nears a 26th year.</p> <p>For Maicon Mancini is like Ferguson or any other top manager. He says: \"All winning coaches are the same so, if he [Ferguson] has the hairdryer, Roberto has the same passion. All winning managers are the same and they show this passion.\"</p> <p>Mancini can expect on Friday, before Saturday's trip to Fulham, to be asked about his claims that rivals pussyfoot at Old Trafford as his file marked \"problems\" grows thicker. Heading this is the defence. City have conceded 14 goals in seven games. Their last clean sheet came in last season's penultimate match, a 2-0 win at Newcastle United, and this season there has been a trend for goals let in late on.</p> <p>At Real Madrid last week goals in the 87th and 90th minutes turned a 2-1 lead to defeat in City's opening Champions League game. Sunday's 1-1 draw with Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium came from an 82nd-minute Laurent Koscielny goal. This run has City four points behind the leaders, Chelsea, requiring victory against Borussia Dortmund next week to kick-start their Champions League challenge and already out of one cup competition, after another late goal earned Villa extra-time.</p> <p>Mancini is in classic glass half-full, half-empty territory. Positively he can say that all elite teams have sticky patches and, since City's comes at the start of their championship defence, fiercer scrutiny is applied. In addition, despite not rediscovering the panache that won a first title in 44 years, the Blues are unbeaten in the league. Further self-help comes when it is noted that the Villa defeat means City are already out of the fourth-ranked competition they were competing for, which means less of a drain on resources.</p> <p>There is further light for Mancini: his handling of Tevez. Final confirmation that the love affair is back on came when City's congregation roared <em>El Apache</em>'s entrance as a 68th-minute substitute against Arsenal.</p> <p>On Thursday it is a year since Tevez disobeyed his manager's instructions when asked by Mancini to warm up as a substitute for the Champions League group game at Bayern Munich. Then Mancini said: \"If a player earns a lot of money playing for Manchester City in the Champions League and he behaves like this \u2013 he cannot play again. Never.\"</p> <p>But after six months as an outcast Mancini got the apology he wanted from Tevez and his return helped City win the title. Having started this campaign with goals in his first three league matches, Tevez has been City's best player. Over the next few days the Mancini approach faces its latest test.</p> <p><em>Maicon was speaking at the launch of City in the Community's latest Connell Award with Manchester Futsal Club</em></p>",
  "<p>Imagine an America in which anyone can download and print a gun in their own home. They wouldn't need a license, a background check, or much technical knowledge, just a 3D printer. That's the vision a cadre of industrious libertarians are determined to turn into reality.</p> <p>Last week, <a href=\"http://defensedistributed.com/\">Wiki Weapon</a>, a project to create the first fully printable plastic gun received the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/09/20/3d-printed-gun-project-hits-its-fundraising-goal-despite-being-booted-off-indiegogo/\">$20,000</a> in funding it needed to get off the ground. The project's goal is not to develop and sell a working gun, but rather to create an open-source schematic (or blueprint) that individuals could download and use to print their own weapons at home.</p> <p>The technology that makes this possible is 3D printing, a process during which plastic resin is deposited layer by layer to create a three dimensional object. In the past few years 3D printers have become increasingly affordable, and just last week the first two retail stores selling 3D printers opened in the United States with models ranging from <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/24/deezmaker-3d-printer-store-opens-in-pasadena/\">$600</a> to <a href=\"http://store.makerbot.com/replicator2.html\">$2,199</a>.</p> <p>Spearheading the Wiki Weapon project is Cody Wilson, a second-year law student at the University of Texas. After brainstorming the concept with a friend, Wilson assembled a group of engineers, programmers and designers to develop the printable firearm. Initially the collective, which calls itself Defense Distributed, tried to crowd-source start-up capital on the funding website Indiegogo, but after the project began receiving media attention, Indiegogo froze the group's account and refused to hand over approximately $2,000 that Defense Distributed had raised.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AQ6Q3BfbVBU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"480\" height=\"295\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AQ6Q3BfbVBU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Indiegogo asserted that the group violated <a href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/about/terms\">company policy</a>, claiming that the project is related to the sale of firearms. But, as Wilson is quick to point out, Wiki Weapon isn't a for-profit venture and doesn't intend to ever sell tangible firearms. The group's aim is simply to publish a schematic, which would be available online for anyone free of charge.</p> <p>Despite this hiccup, Defense Distributed still managed to raise the money it needed from donors by using the direct deposit platform Bitcoin. However, if what happened with Indiegogo is any indication, the project will likely face more legal hurdles in the future. Since 3D printing technology is so new, the legality of the gun publication is still somewhat opaque.</p> <p>According to Dave Kopel, the research director of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Institute\">Independence Institute</a>, it is <a href=\"http://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/general.html\">legal</a> to create pistols, revolvers and rifles at home, although some states are stricter than others. As long as an inventor isn't selling, sharing or trading the weapon, under federal law, a license isn't necessary. Homemade creations also don't need to be registered with the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and are legal for use by the individual who created the weapon.</p> <p>But there are some exceptions to what can be printed legally. Military-grade weapons like machine guns, rocket launchers, sawed-off shotguns and explosives, as well as concealed firearms (like guns within phones or pens) need prior ATF approval before a manufacturer can create them. Federal law also requires \"any other weapon, other than a pistol or revolver, from which a shot is discharged by an explosive if such weapon is capable of being concealed on the person\" to be subject to ATF review. Since a potential Wiki Weapon would likely be \"any other weapon\", the ATF would probably have to approve a prototype, and the bureau has <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-11386_3-57499326-76/you-dont-bring-a-3d-printer-to-a-gun-fight-yet/\">said</a> as much.</p> <p>Either way, if a fully functional plastic Wiki Weapon is printed, it may be illegal upon creation thanks to an obscure law from the late 1980s. In 1988, Congress passed the Undetectable Firearms Act after the Glock company provoked controversy by selling firearms made with plastic polymers. The technique, which was revolutionary at the time but is common in the industry today, alarmed many gun control advocates who were concerned that plastic guns wouldn't register in airport x-ray machines. </p> <p>Gun rights advocates remember the uproar as hyperbolic because Glocks do contain metal, and x-ray machines don't even distinguish between metal and plastic. The legacy of the Glock controversy is a law that mandates that all US guns must contain at least 3.7 ounces of steel. However, the law is set to expire in December 2013. If Congress doesn't renew it, Wilson and company wouldn't have to worry about the legislation.</p> <p>\"I haven't felt any real heat yet, but I think it's very possible the project might happen outside of America or the files might be hosted outside of America,\" said Wilson who is cognizant of the statute. \"The point of manufacture might also have to be outside of the United States.\"</p> <p>Of course, even if a plastic gun is illegal, it would be incredibly easy to print if a schematic were available. Under US law there's nothing illegal about creating or sharing a schematic for a weapon unless that weapon is copyrighted or patented. Publications like the <a href=\"http://www.freeinfosociety.com/pdfs/misc/anarchistcookbook2000.pdf\">Anarchists Cookbook</a> and nuclear bomb schematics are available online.</p> <p>When asked about the possibility of a Wiki Weapon hypothetically being used by a child or a mentally unstable individual, Wilson, a fierce libertarian, defended the project.</p> <p>\"People say you're going to allow people to hurt people, well that's one of the sad realities of liberty. People abuse freedom,\" said Wilson. \"But that's no excuse to not have these rights or to feel good about someone taking them away from you.\"</p> <p>Another less hypothetical legal issue concerns the receiver or frame of the gun. In the United States manufactured guns are regulated by serial numbers, which are only printed on the receiver. All other parts of a gun \u2013 the barrel, the magazine, the handle, the trigger, etc \u2013 don't have to be registered and can be bought by anyone.</p> <p>Last year an American gunsmith named <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/08/man-3d-printer-rifle_n_1753513.html\">Michael Guslick</a> took advantage of this loophole to upload and print out a receiver (technically known as a lower receiver) for an <a href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11770\">AR-15</a> or M16. He then attached the lower receiver to other gun components, thereby completely circumventing regulations. </p> <p>According to Guslick, after assembling the gun he managed to successfully fire off 200 rounds. In some US jurisdictions, Guslick's experiment would probably have been considered illegal, but what's perhaps most interesting is the implication that today it's already possible, even for someone who has had a gun license revoked, to build their own unregistered firearm at home with printed plastic parts.</p> <p>But Kopel expects 3D gun printing to remain a hobbyist pursuit, at least in the United States.</p> <p>\"If this thing does work I think it would be great for the people in Syria to have a 3D printer so they could start making their own guns and start resisting the mass murderer Assad,\" said Kopel. \"The guy who is robbing a 7-Eleven isn't going to buy a 3D printer.\"</p> <p>According to Peter Swire, an internet law professor at Ohio State University, for the moment 3D printing is just another tool for hobbyists, who have a long history in the US. </p> <p>\"What's important here is the ability to turn software into a gun anywhere in the world,\" said Swire. \"I think the big question is how many 3D printers are we going to have? The more 3D printers the more gun factories there are.\"</p> <p>It's impossible to know exactly how many Americans own guns because there's no gun census, but it's well-known that the US is the <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/08/28/us-world-firearms-idUSL2834893820070828\">most armed</a> nation on earth with about a third of the globe's guns. Kopel questions whether people will go to the trouble of printing guns out when they are so easily available.</p> <p>It's also important to note that building an all-plastic gun is difficult and dangerous. To be successful, the Wiki Weapon will need to be able to absorb the impact of exploding gunpowder and expanding gas, which Guslick <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/08/28/us-world-firearms-idUSL2834893820070828\">doubts</a> could be contained by the type of plastic used in non-industrial 3D printers like the <a href=\"http://www.reprap.org/wiki/RepRap\">RepRap</a> and <a href=\"http://www.makerbot.com/\">Makerbot</a>.</p> <p>For Wilson and his team, however, the challenge isn't necessarily to create a practical firearm. Realistically, he said, a plastic gun would probably only work once and have to be disposed of after use. Even if it were to succeed and the team were able to create a plastic gun, he acknowledged that it's highly unlikely that a Wiki Weapon would replace existing commercial models anytime soon. But that isn't why the group is pursuing the project.</p> <p>Like many Americans Wilson's family had guns when he was growing up in Arkansas, but he isn't as he puts it, \"a guns guy\". He only bought his first gun a year ago and most of his childhood was spent \"with my nose in a book\". Wilson said his interest in making firearms is rooted not in a passion for guns, but in libertarian ideals.</p> <p>\"In the future no one is going to be able to decide who has a gun but you,\" Wilson said. \"This is a project that intends to help subvert older hierarchies and these older modes of thinking.\"</p> <p>By virtue of his legal training, Wilson is the de facto in-house lawyer for the Wiki Weapon project, and he freely admits that he's not entirely sure if the weapon he's creating is legal. But for him, that's part of the project's novelty.</p> <p>\"This project could very well change the way we think about gun control and consumption,\" Defense Distributed states in the \"manifesto\" published on its website. \"How do governments behave if they must one day operate on the assumption that any and every citizen has near instant access to a firearm through the internet? Let's find out.\"</p> <p>It's telling that after a summer of senseless shootings, gun control remains notably absent from the public conversation, and in an election year no less. But if the Wiki Weapon project does print a useable gun, it seems inevitable that the nation will need to evaluate the potential of this new technology and iron out how to regulate it. </p> <p>So maybe Defense Distributed and Cody Wilson will get an answer to their manifesto's query after all. If they're successful, surely we will all find out.</p>",
  "<p>Years ago when I was a cub reporter in Bath, I remember investigating the case of a pretty but forlorn and boarded-up end of terrace house whose ownership was beyond the means of anyone to find out.</p> <p>In the end, the city council obtained an instrument called an<a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/tribunals/lands/jurisdictions/aor\"> Unknown Ownership Compulsory Purchase Order</a> which allowed it to circumvent the lengthy and probably unrewarding business of trying to find out who owned the property and why it had been allowed to decay. </p> <p>In such cases, however, money usually has to be paid into court, in case the owner turns up later like a character in a novel by Charles Dickens. That isn't viable in the current economic climate with councils beset by spending cuts. Maybe the law could be tweaked.</p> <p>In the meanwhile, Salford University is about to help the <a href=\"http://www.agma.gov.uk/\">Association of Greater Manchester Authorities </a>with another set of novel proposals to find the owners of 930 empty houses on their patch. The need for them hardly needs emphasising: there are 100,000 people on Greater Manchester's combined social housing lists.</p> <p>The 930 unused homes might sound paltry in such a context, but they are potentially only the beginning of a much larger exercise. The ten councils which make up the area, Bolton, Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan, estimate that they have 25,000 empty houses altogether.</p> <p>How do you find their owners? That is what the joint exercise is all about, and it isn't going to be easy. As the university's <a href=\"http://www.shusu.salford.ac.uk/\">Housing and Urban Studies Unit </a>says:</p> <blockquote> <p>The reasons for being the owner of an empty home are extremely diverse and difficult to address. Homeowners can be located almost anywhere, be of any ethnic or age profile and may be unwilling or unable to do anything with the house due to finance, emotional attachment or family breakdown.</p> </blockquote> <p>They may also be dead, intestate or occasionally unaware that they actually are a property owner. But on the optimistic side, the housing unit which will be working on the project with the university's <a href=\"http://www.salford.ac.uk/business-school\">Business School</a>, believes that the IT revolution could have untapped potential.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396773657\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/pictures/2011/7/1/1309540240846/Young-people-visit-Salfor-002.jpg\" alt=\"Young people visit Salford University.

Dr Lisa Scullion, who will work as researcher on the project for the Housing and Urban Studies Unit, says: </p> <blockquote> <p>This is not only a widespread problem, but a difficult one to solve But by adopting some new ways of thinking \u2013 such as the use of social media - we're hopeful that a method can be developed that will allow us to increase the number of homes being used as they were intended to be, when they were built.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>The second phase of the project, once owners are traced, will be to use IT and social media to help them cope with getting homes back into use. This could be through sale or transfer, or management by a housing association; the joint team hopes to take as much trouble out of the process as swift links to appropriate partners can provide.</p> <p>The project has been funded through the Government's <a href=\"http://www.ktponline.org.uk/\">Knowledge Transfer Partnership</a> which encourages academics to share new thinking with public bodies, business and others outside what were once known as ivory towers.<br><strong><br>If you can help at all, contact the Housing and Urban Studies unit <a href=\"http://www.shusu.salford.ac.uk/\">here</a>.</strong></p>",
  "<p>Despite Formula One's lofty status at the pinnacle of motorsport, and its claims to be the most-watched global sport (at least on television), in the past, the games that bore its imprimatur have struggled to achieve a similarly elevated reputation. But since Codemasters acquired the F1 licence, it has worked hard to give its F1 games more credibility, and has noticeably pulled out the stops with F1 2012.</p> <p>Games built on sporting franchises, with their annual iterations, usually struggle to provide a persuasive reason to buy every year's new effort, and that was clearly uppermost in Codemasters' minds this time around. So there are plenty of new additions. </p> <p>The first one being a new start to career mode: the young drivers' test. This is essentially a tutorial, split into two days of exercises, and is fairly reminiscent of Gran Turismo's racing-licence tests. Seasoned racing gamers will find it laughably easy, but it provides a much more instantly accessible, and less intimidating, point of entry for tyros, which has to be applauded.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396713321\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/26/1348660141574/F1-2012-front-view-008.jpg\" alt=\"F1 2012 front view\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As ever, the career mode offers plenty of flexibility. If you have all the time in the world, you can do a full season, with all the practice-sessions, full-length races and so on, or you can opt for truncated practice and qualifying and races as short as five laps. </p> <p>F1 2012 has a much-improved interface compared with previous versions. Once stuck into a race weekend, you still do more or less everything via your race engineer, but the game's general layout is much more logical, helped by hub-style screens.</p> <p>Car feel and handling has always been exemplary since Codemasters acquired the F1 licence, and this year the cars are supposed to have been made more stable, but only the really hardcore racing-sim fanatics would notice that. You still have to be careful putting the power down after slow corners, and very cagey on the throttle in the wet \u2013 don't expect arcade-style concessions. The cars, as in real life, are tricky to drive (particularly if you spurn traction-control), which is exactly as it should be.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396713322\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/26/1348660539180/F1-2012-rain-008.jpg\" alt=\"F1 2012 rain\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two new modes for 2012 make a big impression, especially season challenge. This distils a whole season into 10 races, with adrenalin-inducing single-shot, one-lap qualifying runs (you get a ghost image of the pole position man for reference). Cleverly, it is possible to win the championship even in such a truncated set of races, as you must nominate a rival in a superior car and if you beat him in a set of three races, you win his car, thereby potentially elevating yourself to the championship-leading car. </p> <p>Season challenge's hit-the-ground-running nature means it's a good idea to do a career season before you get stuck into it, but it's very addictive and provides a lot of replay value.</p> <p>Champions mode is also new, and takes advantage of the unprecedented presence of six world champions on this year's grid. Each gets their own challenge \u2013 with different tracks and conditions, but you always have to catch and pass the relevant champion \u2013 and if you win them all, you then have to beat all six champions at the new (and still not quite finished) Austin, Texas track. Fantasy Formula One indeed, although similar scenario-modes have been seen in F1 games of yore.</p> <p>The multi-player side of the game has also been improved \u2013 up to 16 players can take each other on now, with eight AI-controlled cars making up a full grid. Thanks to the presence of Codemasters' social networks-aping system Racenet, setting up online challenges with your friends is a breeze and two people can co-operatively play through a single career, as team-mates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396713323\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/26/1348660631443/F1-2012-head-on-008.jpg\" alt=\"F1 2012 head on\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>F1 2012 is incredibly slick, polished and beautifully made, and it's difficult to imagine how Codemasters could have come up with any other means of distinguishing it from its predecessors.</p> <p>Season challenge changes the game's dynamic very cleverly, and yet it's more accessible to gamers at the casual end of the spectrum. By some distance the best Formula One video game ever. But whether that will help it break out to an audience beyond devoted F1 fans remains to be seen.<br> </p> <p><strong>F1 2012 was reviewed on Xbox 360</strong></p>",

However, the mask, when done well, can be a fantastic device that adds to the plot.</p> <p>Tension is often achieved not through what is seen but what is withheld from view. The unmasking can provide a perfect outlet for this tension. This is an event hailing something significant and acts as a catalyst for further plot development.</p> <p>1) <a href=\"http://youtu.be/UXbBlGBoUms\">Donnie Darko</a></p> <p>The unmasking of Frank provides a moment of clarity in a baffling film. Basically, Frank is a chap in a creepy rabbit onesie who appears to the troubled Jake Gyllenhaal (AKA Donnie Darko) and guides him through parallel universes, telekinesis and time travel. Simple, right? In this scene we get to see the man behind the mask. It is at once underwhelming and overwhelming to discover that Frank is human underneath those ears and the repercussions of the unmasking only become fully apparent at the end of the film. The presence of Donnie's sleeping girlfriend, Gretchen, sitting between the two, and the choral music make this scene truly memorable.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UXbBlGBoUms?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UXbBlGBoUms\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/UXbBlGBoUms\">Watch on YouTube</a></p> <p>2) <a href=\"http://youtu.be/X1UmHfWCw-4\">Gladiator</a></p> <p>If ever there was a scene guaranteed to make you clench your fists in expectant triumph then this would be it.

However, it is the unmasking of Heath Ledger's Joker during the first scene of the film, a bank heist shoot-out, which is most worthy of mention. This is the point at which we first see the man who will go on to release multiple cats among myriad pigeons and pave the way for everything that follows.

  "<p>Lauded in his native France, the award-winning author R\u00e9gis Jauffret's new title Claustria, a fictionalised take on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritzl_case\" title=\"\">the Fritzl case</a>, has come under strong attack in Austria where reviewers have described it as \"pure filth\".</p> <p>\"This book is a work of fiction,\" <a href=\"http://www.seuil.com/livre-9782021022513.htm\" title=\"\">writes Jauffret in Claustria</a>, before drawing extensively on the facts of Josef Fritzl's imprisonment and rape of his daughter to tell his story, as well as imagining the family in the</p> <p>future. It was well-received in France \u2013 Jauffret reaches \"the heights of mastery\", wrote one reviewer; \"a tour de force of incredible strength\", said another \u2013 but its publication in Austria earlier this month has provoked a series of vituperative write-ups.</p> <p>The book is \"pure filth\" and \"abysmal\", <a href=\"http://diepresse.com/home/meinung/quergeschrieben/rudolftaschner/1292225/Wer-zu-Jauffrets-Buch-Claustria-greift-hat-reinen-Dreck-in-der-Hand\" title=\"\">wrote Rudolf Taschner in Die Presse</a>. \"Whoever reads it must thoroughly wash their hands afterwards. Jauffret cannot put a human face on any of the characters he steals from real life. They are all the larvae of criminals \u2013 apart from the first person narrator, who finds himself thrown into a terrible world [where] 'a significant number of our fellow citizens are the fruit of incestuous relationships'.\"</p> <p>In Die Welt, Jauffret's novel, <a href=\"http://www.welt.de/kultur/article109297924/Fritzl-Roman-macht-jeden-Oesterreicher-zum-Taeter.html\" title=\"\">\"which makes every Austrian an offender\"</a>, is described as \"voyeuristic\". \"Austria comes off very badly.

Their conclusions were that the cellar was not concrete, not soundproofed, and that you could hear in the house everything which went on in the cellar,\" he said. \"The experts were not called at the trial. Their report was not cited.\"</p> <p>His novel, he says, denounces the \"failings of the police and the justice system, and it's that which the Austrians cannot stand, coming from a French citizen,\" he said. \"But what makes them the most aggressive is that I point out that the anti-incest law in Austria only punishes the father who violates his child \u2013 whatever age the child is \u2013 with <a href=\"http://www.jusline.at/211_Blutschande_StGB.html\" title=\"\">a maximum of three years in prison</a> \u2026 This law is in contradiction with European laws for the protection of children \u2026 I think that all European media should unite their voices to lobby European institutions so that they pressure Austria to change this law. At the time when I am writing, there are children who are being raped there by their parents because of this law. It is urgent to denounce it.\"</p> <p>Jauffret believes it is \"the duty\" of the writer \"not only to talk about romance, or his personal life\", but to write \"of his time, and therefore also of contemporary crimes\".</p> <p>\"The artist arrives after the police, the judiciary and the media who have all spoken of the private life of the victims. Why then is this question always asked of writers?\" he said. \"Those who do wrong to victims are the criminals, not those who talk about them to try and uncover the truth. My novel is a search for the truth. A search that the justice system has not taken to its conclusion.\"</p> <p>Claustria will be published in English in August 2013 by Salammbo Press.</p>",
  "<p>China and Japan have held a \"tense\" hour-long meeting over a group of contested islands, the Japanese foreign minister said, but showed no sign of shifting their stances.</p> <p>The long-running territorial dispute has escalated dramatically in recent weeks, with violent anti-Japanese protests in China over the uninhabited islets, known as the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China.</p> <p>Koichiro Gemba urged Beijing to exercise restraint when he met his counterpart, Yang Jieshi, on the sidelines of the UN general assembly on Tuesday, according to Japan's Kyodo news agency.</p> <p>Xinhua, China's state news agency, said Yang reiterated that the East China Sea islands had been the country's \"sacred territory since ancient times\".</p> <p>The Japanese chief cabinet secretary, Osamu Fujimura, told a news conference in Tokyo that talks were needed through various channels, adding: \"There is no magic bullet in foreign diplomacy.\"</p> <p>The countries' deputy foreign ministers had also held talks in Beijing on Monday. China's foreign ministry spokesman said they discussed issues \"frankly and deeply\".</p> <p>Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, north Asia director for the International Crisis Group, welcomed the discussions as a positive step.</p> <p>\"It's a good sign that they're talking, but it's difficult to see how either one is going to be able to substantially walk back their positions,\" she said.</p> <p>\"One hopes they will be able to exercise the leadership and vision necessary, but there are domestic challenges in both countries which make it very difficult for the leaderships to be seen as weak on this issue. The status quo was broken by Japan's purchase of the islands and China's announcement of the baseline.\"</p> <p>China is preparing for the handover of power to a new generation of leaders, while in Japan the unpopular ruling party will soon face an election.</p> <p>Japan's purchase of the islands came after the nationalist governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, said the city would buy them. The central government feared that would spark greater conflict.</p> <p>The islands are surrounded by fisheries and potentially valuable energy resources, but the dispute is also fuelled by long-running historical tensions over Japan's brutal occupation of China in the 1930s and 1940s, as well as Japanese anxieties over China's growing might.</p> <p>Analysts say neither side wants the matter to escalate \u2013 particularly given the risk of further damage to crucial economic ties.</p> <p>But there are concerns that an unintended collision or a misjudgment in a standoff between vessels from the two countries in the waters around the islands might spark a more serious clash.</p> <p>Reuters reported that Japanese carmakers Toyota, Nissan and Suzuki are already cutting back on production in China after the mass protests closed dealerships and dimmed sales prospects. Xinhua said over 52,000 seat reservations have been cancelled on flights between the two countries between September and November, citing All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines.</p> <p>On Monday, the Japanese coastguard used water cannon to disperse dozens of fishing boats from Taiwan \u2013 which also claims the islands \u2013 from disputed waters.</p> <p>A spokesman for Beijing's state council Taiwan affairs office said that Chinese vessels would be ready to offer help to both Taiwanese and mainland vessels fishing around the islands, Xinhua reported on Wednesday.</p> <p>China is involved in several territorial disputes. Xinhua announced that officials plan a 10-fold increase in the maximum punishment for failures to map it in full. Current regulations stipulate a fine of up to 10,000 yuan for those who fail to include the country's entire territory, but the new law would increase the maximum penalty to 100,000 yuan.</p>",

Now Thompson on Hollywood reports that the independent Portland-based studio Laika, which worked with the film-maker on the critically acclaimed Coraline, <a href=\"http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/immersed-in-movies-will-laika-come-to-the-rescue-of-stop-motion-director-henry-selick#\" title=\"\">may be set to step in and save the film</a>.</p> <p>The arrangement might suit both parties in the short-term, though the ongoing existence of Cinderbiter, Selick's 150-strong animation studio in San Francisco, must still be in some doubt. It had been set up in 2010 with Disney money as part of what was described at the time as a long-term contract to produce stop-motion animation films, only for the company to reportedly find Selick's first project \"too dark\". Despite having been shooting since the previous summer, industry blog Deadline reported last month that the film \"just wasn't coming together in a manner that pleased the studio\".</p> <p>Disney's jitteriness may be due to concern over recent losses on films such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142787/john-carter\" title=\"\">John Carter</a>, which cost it at least $200m earlier in the year. It is not known whether the studio would be able to claw back some of the projected $50m losses on the new Selick film if the deal with Laika goes ahead.</p> <p>The latter studio was also behind current stop-motion 3D venture <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148980/paranorman\" title=\"\">ParaNorman</a>.

  "<p>Throughout this US election, <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/05/will-republicans-vast-super-pac-money-advantage-swing-the-election.html\">one of the most popular narratives among Democrats</a> and in the liberal press is that the Republicans are doing their damnedest to wrest this election from any kind of democratic process. They are, <a href=\"http://theweek.com/article/index/228625/conservatives-1-billion-spending-blitz-will-they-buy-the-election\">the theory has gone</a>, going to buy it and <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0512/76849.html\">they are doing this through the Super Pacs</a>, which were legalised into existence in 2010.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/koch-brothers\">trope of these shadowy rightwing billionaires</a> <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/24/sheldon-adelson-donations_n_1910094.html?utm_hp_ref=elections-2012\">controlling the country</a> from behind the Super Pac fig leaves is so familiar that it is satirised in Will Ferrell and Zack Galifinakis' upcoming, very silly and intermittently <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7yC0iiK7a4\">political comedy, The Campaign</a>. Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow play a pair of Mr Smithers-like brothers who bear a more-than-passing resemblance to David and Charles Koch, two American billionaire libertarians who, due to their wealth and political manipulation, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/30/100830fa_fact_mayer?currentPage=all\">have been described</a> as \"the Standard Oil of our time\".</p> <p>However, it is increasingly looking like the Super Pacs might not have the impact that the Democrats feared. For a start, even through the Republicans have much more money than the Democrats to spend through outside groups \u2013 estimates ranging from anywhere between four times as much, to 18 times as much, are routinely bandied about \u2013 Romney is by no means killing it. At best, it's a dead heat and, <a href=\"http://politicalwire.com/archives/2012/09/24/latest_swing_state_polls.html\">according to the latest polls</a>, he's losing in the crucial swing states.</p> <p>\"People just aren't paying attention to political ads the way they used to,\" a <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443890304578010554134840248.html\">Republican campaign pollster told</a> the Wall Street Journal this week by way of explanation, and this is almost certainly true. Another possible factor is that, in this election, political adverts don't really matter simply because so many people in America aren't actually voting for either candidate: they're just voting against the other one. So if someone has simply decided that they just want Obama out, all the anti-Romney adverts in the world won't make much of a difference to them. </p> <p>But if you can't get people to pay attention to the ads, or change their mind, you could just stop them from voting at all. And it is here that accusations of election thievery both stick and might have more cause for concern.</p> <p>There has been much anxious talk about voter fraud from the conservatives and the rightwing media, so much so that <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/topics/elections/voter-fraud.htm\">Fox News even has a \"voter fraud unit\"</a>. To prevent this terrible crime against democracy, the Republicans have been striving to implement voter ID and voter suppression laws, focusing particularly on the crucial swing states, with eight states already passing the law that people must provide a state-approved document and photo in order to vote. This move will, as it happens, mainly affect minority groups, the poor, the elderly and students when it comes to voting \u2013 not because it's illegal for them to vote, but because these are the groups that most commonly don't have photo ID, such as driving licenses and passports. As it happens, these are also the groups more likely to vote Democrat than Republican. And, of course, the Republicans know that: Mike Turzai, the Republican state representative for Pennsylvania, said in a talk in June:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Voter ID, which is going to allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania? Done.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Other states have gone for the simpler routes of changing what times people can vote and trying to make it <a href=\"http://wonkette.com/481510/hero-elections-officials-in-ohio-save-voting-process-from-black-people\">as inconvenient as possible for black Americans to vote</a>, for example, or \u2013 as a compromise \u2013 proposing to extend voting hours <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2012/08/10/670441/ohio-limits-early-voting-hours-in-democratic-counties-expands-in-republican-counties/\">but only in Republican areas</a>.</p> <p>Now, all this would be bad enough if voter fraud was actually a problem. But it isn't. Despite extensive searches by Republicans in Florida and Colorado, <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/politics/171009711.html?page=2&amp;c=y&amp;refer=y\">they have found less than one tenth of 1%</a> of illegals among registered voters. Colorado's secretary of state, Scott Gessler, claimed last year that 11,805 non-citizens were committing voter fraud. <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/politics/171009711.html?page=2&amp;c=y&amp;refer=y\">As AP reported this week</a>, this number has since been revised to 141 and, of those, only 35 have voted. This amounts to 0.004% of the state's votes.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/jon-stewart-rips-conservatives-and-their-media-division-fox-news-for-exaggerating-voter-fraud/\">Jessica Williams on the Daily Show said last month</a>, what these voter fraud laws are mainly about is: \"If you're not going to vote for Mitt Romney, stay the fuck at home.\" Elizabeth Drew, <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2012/sep/21/voting-wrongs/\">writing New York Review of Books blog this week</a> on the voter fraud nonsense, put it even stronger:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The wrongdoing that we are seeing in this election \u2026 is the worst thing that has happened to our democratic election system since the late 19th century, when legislatures in southern states systematically negated the voting rights blacks had won in the 15th amendment to the constitution.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This election will be extremely close and the outcome could come down to votes numbering in the six figures. Democrats might have thought that money was their biggest hurdle against the Republicans. But, not for the first time, they may have underestimated their opponent.</p>",
  "<p>In theory, what a private individual chooses to do with his or her money is nobody else's business. We live in a country where you may dispose of it however you see fit, so long as you break no laws. You are free to indulge silly fantasies, to treat yourself, to spend on things others might perceive as having no value.</p> <p>In practice, this isn't always the case, and with good reason. We are a society, not simply a collection of individuals, and our behaviour has ramifications. We participate in an economy, where our decisions about money affect others. Just ask hedge fund manager <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/04/creditcrunch\" title=\"\">Crispin Odey</a>, who paid himself \u00a328m in 2008, after successfully betting that shares in British banks would fall through the floor. He's decided to spend a much more modest sum on a home for his chickens: media reports estimate the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/citydiary/9563587/Crispin-Odeys-chickens-come-home-to-a-luxury-roost.html\" title=\"\">stone alone will cost more than \u00a3100,000</a>.</p> <p>The stone, you say? Yes, the Odey chickens will be housed in style \u2013 no coop for them. Nothing as d\u00e9class\u00e9 as chicken wire hems them in. And yet, if visions of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/07/pass-notes-duck-house\" title=\"\">Sir Peter Viggers' notorious duck house</a> have been conjured, dismiss them and think bigger, much bigger. Odey's gaff is a galline Parthenon.</p> <p>We know this because detailed plans for the chicken house, which surfaced yesterday, are available on the local council's website. Odey may have the money to realise his wildest dreams (I hope for his sake that these extend beyond luxurious accommodation for domestic fowl), but he has to submit to the law of the land, which requires public scrutiny of building projects. Before I return to the moral case for exposing Odey to opprobrium, it's worth analysing these on aesthetic grounds. Whatever the conscious reasons for his choices, they reveal much about what contemporary City money admires.</p> <p>It appears to admire shows of learning and wit, though these concepts appear to have a different meaning among the financial class than they do for the rest of us. As the chickens despoil the polished Forest of Dean stone floors with their droppings, they may pause to admire the Ionic columns that surround them. It's not clear why Odey chose this particular <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Orders_of_Architecture\" title=\"\">order of architecture</a>, though it's known for its elegant simplicity, in contrast to fussy Corinthian or bulky Doric. They may glance up and catch sight of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acroterion\" title=\"\">acroterion</a> on the roof. They may cluck with surprise as they realise that, nestling inside the conventional palmette motif is a sculpted egg (this is the witty bit). There are even <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/citydiary/9566344/Revealed-the-private-stalls-that-await-Crispin-Odeys-chickens.html\" title=\"\">rumours of a Humpty Dumpty-themed frieze</a> in the band that would usually be reserved for carvings of martial exploits.</p> <p>Eggs and Humpty Dumpty aside, the chicken house is straightforwardly, even boringly, classical. Call to mind that duck house again. It was an eclectic little thing, an English pastiche in the spirit of, say, Brighton's Royal Pavilion. Odey has gone instead for something much more serious, and therefore pretentious: an attempt to emulate the taste of the ancients. The building is said to have taken its cue from the Greek revivalism of Friedrich Schinkel, a very sober Prussian architect whose works include the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Museum\" title=\"\">Altes Museum</a> in Berlin. Schinkel's projects lent timeless gravitas to a burgeoning empire by borrowing from empires of old. If Odey is making a similar bid for greatness, we must see it as an attempt to bring the spirit of the god-like hedge fund manager, with his Olympian appetite for money-making, to the Welsh borders. Atlas is never off duty. The overall effect is very 80s: the man in the suit leaning against a corner of the building in the drawing could be Peter York or Gordon Gekko.</p> <p>The 80s, of course, was when the modern City was created. The foundations for this chicken house were laid in 1986, with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/09/big-bang-1986-city-deregulation-boom-bust\" title=\"\">explosive deregulation of the big bang</a>. From that point on capital was free to flit between London and the rest of the world, with financiers pecking off their portions of ever-larger, ever-faster transactions. Conspicuous displays of wealth become inevitable when you accrue more money than you sensibly know what to do with.</p> <p>Which brings me back to why we should care what a private individual does with his or her cash. It is a question of degree, of course. There's no public interest in the well-off doctor, accountant or manager who decides to dig a swimming pool or build a treehouse. But a significant chunk of Odey's huge personal fortune was made from a series of events that proved catastrophic for the wider economy. His wealth wouldn't have been possible without the passing of laws many now dearly long to see reversed and which, arguably, have impoverished millions. In that context, what you do with it does matter. And in this particular case, there's the feeling that those who aren't as lucky as Odey are having their noses rubbed in it. We appear to exist in an age where some chickens get treated like kings while hundreds of thousands of humans live like battery hens.</p> <p>Apparently, Odey, who is \"part of the old money City establishment, highly educated, conservative in taste\", has said he \"<a href=\"http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/features/1061079/the-mt-interview-crispin-odey-odey-asset-management/\" title=\"\">does not believe in crass displays of spending power</a>\". But if he can't see what's crass about his chicken house, then someone needs to have a quiet word with him. For me, at least, it's a vision of clucking hell.</p>",
  "<p><em>Nicola Adams became the first ever female Olympic boxing champion when she won gold for GB at the London 2012 Games.</em></p> <p>Boxing is so much more than just a physical sport. It's a game of the mind. It gives you willpower and determination. It teaches you how to be dedicated. Nothing compares to that feeling of getting into a ring, in front of hundreds and hundreds of people, and knowing that when the bell goes, it's just you in there, fighting for yourself. That teaches you a lot about confidence. Now I know that if I want to get something done, I can do it as long as I put my mind to it.</p> <p>When I was young, I used to watch <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali\" title=\"\">Muhammad Ali</a> fighting on the television all the time with my dad. I loved how exciting it was. When I was 12, my mum took me with her to the gym because she had an aerobics class and couldn't find a babysitter. There was an after-school boxing class on and I ended up in there. I loved it, and started going three times a week. Our class was like a little family.</p> <p>The boxing classes were meant to be mixed, but I was the only girl in there. I didn't mind \u2013 I've grown up with two brothers, so I've always been used to being the only girl. As I got older, I trained exactly as hard as the lads did. If they did 10 push ups, I did 10 push ups. My coaches never said that I couldn't do it because I was a girl. I used to spar with the boys. I was never treated differently; I was treated as an equal. If anything, that made me a better boxer.</p> <p>When I realised I'd won gold at the Olympics, I had goose pimples all over. I remember wanting to cry and wanting to cheer at the same time. I couldn't believe how much support I had; afterwards, I heard the prime minister and the royals had been watching and it was just unbelievable.</p> <p>Winning gold was my dream come true. It was what I had set out to do, but at the time I didn't think about what I'd done for the country, or how much it meant for the sport \u2013 that's still taking a while to sink in. It's so great that more girls want to box now. I hope that when I retire, there will be a young woman ready to fill my shoes.</p> <p>It feels weird to think younger women see me a role model, but it's an honour at the same time. My role model is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_Ray_Leonard\" title=\"\">Sugar Ray Leonard</a>. I got to meet him last week and he asked me what made me take up boxing and I said \"you\". It was amazing that he even knew who I was; I couldn't believe he knew my name.</p> <p>I still get nervous before every fight. It's those fight-or-flight nerves. My way of dealing with it is to try and stay in control of the situation, rather than let the nerves take control of me. I'll listen to music before I go on, maybe something by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest\" title=\"\">Kanye West</a> \u2013 music that fires me up and gets me in the zone.</p> <p>I know there are people who don't agree with women boxing. But at the end of the day, boxing is just a sport and women should be able to do any sport they choose. We're at a stage now where it's all about equality. If a woman wants to play a sport, she can. There's nothing stopping us.</p>",
  "<p>The best and the worst? For the moment the worst column may outweigh the best. But there is plenty of time for that to change.</p> <h2>The worst</h2> <p>Exasperation has set in whenever it rains. Dry days are often followed by wet evenings \u2014 in Colombo especially \u2014 and there has been only half an hour of leeway to get a game in. So players and spectators mull around all day and then are frustrated as the rain descends.</p> <p>TV schedules are sacrosanct. But there is an absurdity here best exemplified by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/24/ireland-west-indies-world-twenty20\" title=\"\">West Indies and Ireland game</a>. There was a way for them to play that match (start earlier, for example) but instead the Irish were denied the chance of producing an epic performance. Moreover, this is an odd time to have a tournament in Sri Lanka. There is the suspicion that the ICC is more interested in a convenient, lucrative tournament than a dry one.</p> <p>There has been a dearth of close games so far. The usual truism (I've used it myself) is that the shorter the game the more likely the upset. Yet that has not been the case. The analysts of the big teams have set to work. Not much is left to chance. Zimbabwe were thrashed twice, Bangladesh twice, Ireland once, Afghanistan once.</p> <p>There were too many empty seats at the start (it costs between 14p and 50p to get in) but the crowds are starting to turn up \u2013 and they have seen some fine batting, though not by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/23/world-twenty20-england-india\" title=\"\">England against India</a>. That was easily the most inept batting by a major side in the tournament so far. It was a macabre performance by England's youthful middle order. They are exciting; they are not reliable.</p> <p>Flash interviews in between innings \u2013 what a banal intrusion into what are supposed to be life and death struggles.</p> <p>One final grumble. It is a pain to have to keep an eye and an ear on the punditry of ESPN's Cricket Extra. In fact, KP has been rather good \u2013 he's starting to enjoy it \u2013 but we could do without having to check whether he has committed an indiscretion or not. Some say he should not have accepted the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/21/kevin-pietersen-england-luke-wright\" title=\"\">ESPN invitation</a>. Have you heard how many 0s there are at the end of his contract? It might be a while before he appears on TMS.</p> <h2>The best</h2> <p>There have been fine moments too. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/19/england-afghanistan-world-twenty-20\" title=\"\">Afghanistan's performance against India</a> was uplifting, thanks to Shapoor Zadran, the left-arm opening bowler, who prowled around like Goran Ivanisevic. And that helicopter shot from Mohammad Shahzad.</p> <p>The pitches have been excellent with sufficient bounce to encourage six-hitting. Yet the good spinners have prospered, especially those with a bit of mystery. Watch out for Sunil Narine, so bland in England for West Indies, and any of the Indians as well as Saeed Ajmal and Ajantha Mendis. I have a sneaking feeling West Indies might pick Samuel Badree, a wrist-spinner from Trinidad, against England (the analysts will have to earn their corn to find much footage of him).</p> <p>Chris Gayle still adds a frisson whenever he takes guard and check out his training shoes. The heels match his socks so it looks as if he is wearing sandals. Virat Kohli looks in wonderful form, so too Imran Nazir and Nasir Jamshed of Pakistan, and New Zealand's Brendon McCullum.</p> <p>Jos Buttler's fielding. Jonny Bairstow's fielding. But we want to applaud their batting.</p> <p>And there was a nice moment at about 12.30am at the Ireland hotel after the washed out game against West Indies. Supporters and families, milling around the bar when the team returned to the hotel, broke out into a round of spontaneous and constant applause. Ireland had not played particularly well but they loved 'em anyway.</p>",
  "<p>More than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/25/north-england-floods-homes\" title=\"Floods hit 300 homes in north England\">300 homes have been flooded in the north of England</a> after almost twice the average rainfall for September drenched parts of St Helen's in Lancashire and Morpeth in Northumberland in 48 hours.</p> <p>Flood warnings and alerts remain in place in areas of the north and south-west of England.</p> <h2>What does a flood warning mean?</h2> <p>The Met Office, Environment Agency and Scottish Environment Protection Agency all offer advice to the public on any threat posed by the weather.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/warnings/\" title=\"Met Office weather warnings\">Met Office</a> warns the public about \"severe or hazardous weather which has the potential to cause danger to life or widespread disruption\" through its National Severe Weather Warning Service. Warnings can be issued for rain, snow, wind, fog and ice and are given a colour depending on how likely it is a weather event will occur and what impact it may have. Green means no severe weather; yellow ups the ante to \"be aware\"; amber means \"be prepared\"; red means \"take action\".</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/\" title=\"Environment Agency website\">Environment Agency</a> issues flood risk announcements for England and Wales with three levels of severity: flood alerts (meaning \"flooding is possible, be prepared\"); flood warnings (\"flooding is expected, immediate action required\"); and severe flood warnings (\"severe flooding, danger to life\").</p> <p>It issues these across seven regions: Anglia, the Midlands, the north-east, the north-west, the south-east, the south-west, and Wales. On its website you can look at specific flood risk locations and view maps. In Scotland, the <a href=\"http://floodline.sepa.org.uk/floodupdates/\" title=\"Scottish Environment Protection Agency website\">Scottish Environment Protection Agency</a> issues alerts on the same scale.</p> <p>For those in areas liable to flooding, it makes sense to sign up to the <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/38289.aspx\" title=\"Environment Agencys Floodline\">Environment Agency's Floodline</a>, a free service which sends a message to your phone or email when flooding is expected.</p> <h2>What will the emergency services do?</h2> <p>Emergency services do not automatically have to act when a flood alert has been issued, but they will monitor potentially affected areas more closely. Local authorities work with the police, fire and rescue services as well as the Environment Agency to co-ordinate responses during severe flooding.</p> <p>If there is a major flood incident, it is the police who co-ordinate the emergency services and help with the evacuation of people from their homes where necessary (they will also issue warnings to motorists and close roads where necessary). The fire service is primarily responsible for saving lives, but it may also pump out floodwater (contact your local service to ask about this \u2013 there may be a charge).</p> <p>The emergency services advise people to listen to local radio and TV for announcements. You should also check with your local authority for updates. If the flooding is serious, be prepared for the emergency services and your local authority to evacuate you.</p> <h2>There is a flood alert for my area. What should I do?</h2> <p>Tune in to the local radio station so you can keep up with what is going on and to check the local weather forecast. It might be sensible to locate a battery or wind-up radio in case the power supply is hit.</p> <p>Prepare a flood kit: home insurance documents, torch, warm waterproof clothing, first aid kit and prescription medicine, bottled water and non-perishable food, baby food and care items.</p> <p>Think about who will need help to get out of danger, including vulnerable neighbours and pets.</p> <h2>The alert has changed to a warning \u2013 what now?</h2> <p>Turn off your gas and electricity. Move family, pets, important and precious items (including other insurance policy documents, birth certificates etc) to a safe position (the highest floor/attic).</p> <p>Put any flood protection products you have in place, including airbrick covers, floorboards (to fit around windows and doors), sandbags (stuff pillow cases or plastic bags with earth if you don't have sandbags) and sink and bath plugs weighed down by heavy objects to stop water coming up the pipes.</p> <p>If there is time also move other items such as expensive furniture, electrical equipment, lightweight rugs and carpets to the top floor in the house, and move your car to higher ground.</p> <p>Plug water inlet pipes with towels or cloths, and disconnect any equipment that uses water.</p> <h2>I'm already flooded \u2013 what now?</h2> <p>The most important thing is to stay safe. Co-operate with the emergency services and evacuate your home if told to do so. Call 999 if you are in danger.</p> <p>If your home is actually underwater it is too late to worry about saving items, but you should think about what to do once the waters start to recede. Your first step should be to call your insurance company \u2013 most have 24-hour emergency helplines.</p> <h2>What if I can't find my policy document?</h2> <p>Don't panic, your insurer should be able to find you on its database. Look on its website or call a directory inquiries line to get its number. If you car is underwater you will have to call your motor insurance company as well. Bear in mind you will only be able to make a claim if you have fully comprehensive cover.</p> <h2>What should I do next?</h2> <p>If you are able to stay in your property but need help to prevent further damage, speak to your insurer before arranging emergency repairs and keep any receipts for work done so you can claim for the cost. Where possible, take photographs to record the damage, as this could help with your claim.</p> <p>Remember that water and electricity don't mix: if your electricity supply is not switched off, ask a qualified person to deal with this. Do not touch sources of electricity while standing in water.</p> <p>Don't throw damaged things away, even if you will need to replace them, without first checking with your insurer. It is likely to want a loss adjustor to assess the damage and work out how much your payout should be. Use a permanent ink pen to mark how high water has risen in every room and make a list of what damage has occurred, including food touched by flood water and anything in your fridge and freezer.</p> <p>Keep a note of all phone calls with your insurance company, recording the date, time, name of the person you spoke to and what was agreed.</p> <p>Check whether the insurer will pay for the cleaning of your property, or if you are expected to do that.</p> <h2>What if I've had to leave my property?</h2> <p>In the first instance, you may be moved to emergency shelter by the rescue services, but after that you may need to move somewhere else while work is done to make your home habitable again. Building and contents insurance will usually include provision for alternative accommodation if the damage is so great you are unable to stay at home. If you have both types of policy, your building insurer will be expected to take care of your claim for somewhere to stay.</p> <p>Most insurers will ask you to approve with them the accommodation you are moving to before your stay begins. Sadly, they are unlikely to stretch to the Ritz \u2013 alternative accommodation is supposed to be in keeping with your normal lifestyle, so for most people that will mean a standard hotel or B&amp;B, at least in the short term.</p>",
  "<p>In South Africa, with its history of colonialism and apartheid, each creative work makes a political point. Whether focusing on injustice or universal loneliness, here, one makes a political point. One is either part of what former Nobel prize committee member <a href=\"http://www.svenskaakademien.se/en/the_academy/members/horace_engdahl_1\" title=\"\">Horace Engdahl</a> calls \"the great dialogue of literature about the improvement of humanity\", or suggesting that one doesn't particularly care for it.</p> <p>Being raised within an Afrikaner ethnic clamp and language, of which the very foundations are political, the issue of whether writing should in fact be political seems asking the obvious. What was interesting was the influence of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans\" title=\"\">Afrikaans</a> literature on the formation of a community.</p> <p>Two examples: a play called Die Pluimsaad waai ver, by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._P._van_Wyk_Louw\" title=\"\">NP van Wyk Louw</a>, the best poet Afrikaans produced, formed part of the Republic festivities in 1966. The Anglo-Boer War tension within Afrikanerdom itself was van Wyk Louw's theme and underpinned by his belief in loyal resistance which reminded a nation that it was better to perish than to survive through injustice. The play therefore opened with an old woman walking on to the stage, asking: \"What is a nation?\"</p> <p>The opening was attended by Prime Minister <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_Verwoerd\" title=\"\">Hendrik Verwoerd</a>. A few days later, on Republic Day at the Voortrekker monument, <a href=\"http://hendrikverwoerd.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Verwoerd raised his disapproval of the play </a>to three quarters of a million people, the biggest crowd ever to have assembled in the country until then. When will it happen, Verwoerd asked, that writers and poets step forward to sing the praises of our heroic achievements instead of asking waveringly: \"What is a nation?\" but who will cry out: \"This is my nation, my nation is like this, thus it can do wonders, thus it can create its own future\".</p> <p>He was loudly applauded and van Wyk Louw was deeply hurt.</p> <p>In the light of today, this interaction is something to envy. A head of state who goes to a serious play, commissioned by his department of art, and then engages with the text sounds like a head of state who goes to an art gallery. One who walks through an exhibition all about how his party has sold out its values, then goes out not to censor but to engage with the essence of the exhibition.</p> <p>The second example of political literary engagement is a poetry volume by poet GA Watermeyer titled Die republiek van duisend jaar, sponsored by the Afrikaner bank Volkskas. The volume addresses teachers, police, youth, church leaders, war veterans, workers and captains of industry, calling them to excellence in serving the Afrikaner.</p> <p>One poem says: \"The hand that draws the voter's cross/is the hand that touches the future.\" In another, the police say: \"We are the bridle that tames crime; we are the hand with which children safely cross the street; we are order, we are law; we are the eye watched by the Eye of God. To teachers: You are the casting forms of our youth; you are building with more than steel and stone, our being a nation revolves around this.\"</p> <p>As I child I often heard these poems recited at school events or by politicians. The point I make is that literature was used, in contrast to being censored, both to engage sharply about values and principles and to create a coherent vocabulary (in this case for the Afrikaner) about identity. But most important of all: the fact that the voice of the artist was valued proved crucial for later, effective, anti-apartheid resistance by writers and singers.</p> <p>The ANC in exile also interacted with art. Those who attended any of their cultural events in Amsterdam, London or Zimbabwe would never forget how art wove all the dreams, yearnings, furies and griefs into enduring visions of an all-encompassing, beautiful and humane future.</p> <p>The transformative use and political effect of art blossomed in the arts pages of, especially, the Mail and Guardian and Vrye Weekblad. We dreamt that every library would adopt a writer to organise reading and writing circles; that every bus stop, train, railway station and government waiting area would have beautiful posters with the words of our poets; that every foyer guard would have books to read; that many small, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaza_shop\" title=\"\">spaza-like</a> book shops would shoot up as happened in Lesotho and Zimbabwe; that translation would proliferate; that classrooms would spin with books; that newspapers would plumb our literature; that we would know the words of our writers by heart; that young writers would find support to tell their breathtaking truths.</p> <p>We knew how, in other cultures, ordinary people quoted the poems of their writers \u2013 Russian poet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/anna-akhmatova\" title=\"\">Anna Ahkmatova</a> heard herself being recited while standing in a bread queue. Through <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/pablo-neruda\" title=\"\">Pablo Neruda</a>, Chileans made love and salads and fought for freedom.</p> <p>The ANC of 1994 continued its engagement with literature. Opening the first democratic parliament, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zMwdBX1V_8\" title=\"\">Nelson Mandela used an Ingrid Jonker poem </a>to cast the sorrow of the past into a transcendent embrace. Yes, Mandela is a reader. He mentions the effect of Xhosa poet<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Edward_Krune_Mqhayi\" title=\"\"> SEK Mqhayi </a>on him. He once engaged Afrikaans writer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsa_Joubert\" title=\"\">Elsa Joubert </a>on the relationship between white and black in her book: Die Staf van Monomotapa.</p> <p>The new parliament teemed with art \u2013 imbongis were everywhere, <a href=\"http://www.cca.ukzn.ac.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=158%3Ajennifer-ferguson-south-africa&amp;catid=31&amp;Itemid=45\" title=\"\">Jennifer Ferguson</a> sang in her bench, an international art exhibition was on the walls, <a href=\"http://www.whoswho.co.za/trevor-manuel-918\" title=\"\">Trevor Manuel </a>kicked off his budget speech with literary quotes and languages (he was the first to quote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/benokri\" title=\"\">Ben Okri</a>), labour minister Shepherd Mdladlana performed the poem by <a href=\"http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/jjr-jolobe\" title=\"\">JJR Jolobe</a>, Ukwenziwa komkhonzi (The making of a servant) while being loudly applauded by fellow MPs across party lines; <a href=\"http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/geraldine-fraser-moleketi\" title=\"\">Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi</a> used poetry and of course so did the early <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/mbeki\" title=\"\">Thabo Mbeki</a>. He not only quoted from Mqhayi, Shakespeare and Yeats, but could do a traditional praise poem off the cuff or deliver his I am an African speech with such poetic rhythm and imagery that it deservedly became the most remembered, quoted and praised speech of this country. Remember also the debate within the ANC about<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/jm-coetzee\" title=\"\"> John Coetzee's</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780099540984/disgrace\" title=\"\">Disgrace</a> \u2013 engaging, not censoring; a political party who understood the value of literature.</p> <p>However, this engagement was never properly supported by policy and deed. Since 1994, the department of arts and culture is the harmlessness-inducing trashcan of the ANC: the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkatha_Freedom_Party\" title=\"\">IFP</a> trade-offs and those politically-too-free-tongued such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/10/winnie-mandela-south-africa-anc\" title=\"\">Winnie Mandela</a> and <a href=\"http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/Pallo-Jordan-ANC-in-crisis-20120908\" title=\"\">Pallo Jordan</a>. We produce dancers, singers and musicians of international quality, our writers are translated, read and engaged across the world, our visual artists count among the best \u2013 all without a focused supportive art department. Left in the lurch by efforts to eradicate poverty, stabbed in the back by an education system, talent is bursting from neglected grassroots in the blind hope of being picked up by talent competitions or patrons.</p> <p>Why appoint somebody as poet laureate, or announce international or local awards to South African poets and writers without a proper programme in place to introduce, translate and analyse the work of, for example, <a href=\"http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/african-writing-voice-willie-kgositsile\" title=\"\">Willie Kgositsile</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongane_Wally_Serote\" title=\"\">Wally Serote</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/sindiwe-magona\" title=\"\">Sindiwe Magona</a>?</p> <p>This makes me wonder: which books are on the bedside tables of our ministers? How many book shelves had been built into the newly renovated presidential and ministerial houses? How many reading circles are in the parliamentary complexes? What novels are the captains of industry reading there in business class? What poetry volumes are in the judges' smart cases? What literary texts are to be found in doctors' waiting rooms, or on teachers' or parents' tables?</p> <p>Do we really want to fund an <a href=\"http://www.sabc.co.za/wps/portal/SABC/SABCHOME\" title=\"\">SABC</a> which feeds us the crass consumerism of programmes like Top Billing or glamorous events where the brains of celebs, desperate to say something meaningful, rear around like newly hatched chicks in empty nests? How is it possible that our television channels are bookless, but feed a population, fatally choking on inequality, a continuous insolent stream of bling and d\u00e9cor by shoe-obsessed yappers for whom the phrase \"under the breadline\" is just another diet. Radio, thank God, still has excellent English and Afrikaans book programmes, Afrikaans an exquisite poetry programme by Margot Luyt.</p> <p>Why should a country read its writers? The short answer is so that one's president does not need to ask: why do we rape babies and kill each other? He would have read <a href=\"http://vukanathibooks.com/\" title=\"\">Nkosinathi Sithole</a>'s Hunger eats a man in Zulu and knew. He would have read what we write from our wounds and our anguished hopes and he would never see us as election fodder.</p> <p>Because a government hears only its own voice, it knows it hears only its own voice, yet it likes to harbour the illusion that it is hearing the voice of the people, and it demands that the people too should harbour this illusion.</p> <p>That is why a cabinet should read literature. Neither the state which it controls, nor the good plans to turn the country around, would help in the absence of a visionary vocabulary (produced best by writers and poets) to create what <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Nussbaum\" title=\"\">Martha Nussbaum </a>described as an <a href=\"http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/11/005-martha-nussbaum-poets-defender-22\" title=\"\">inspired emphatic social cohesion</a>.</p> <p>The longer answer is that literature inflects the anguish of reality in a way that theoretical discussions of the same issues cannot achieve, making possible a kind of understanding not accessible by other means. <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vyLHbRJfwcYC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=gagiano+intricate+weave&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3TvGuZ8fdr&amp;sig=c3PZjdIvgGD0pH6XyWJGiKVnPfI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wbZhUMSAKs6whAfp24HoAw&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=gagiano%20intricate%20weave&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">Annie Gagiano remarked that </a>being in the world and governing requires an intricate weave of perception and response of reacting and embracing.

  "<p>In 2002 an anarcho-punk group called Thought Crime released a song entitled \"All Landlords are Scum\". As a liberal-minded type, I don't usually agree with such sweeping generalisations \u2013 surely there are plenty of good, professional landlords out there? Perhaps. But as I embark on my third year at university, I can say that landlords have been the biggest headache of my academic career.</p> <p>I could bore you with my many sob stories \u2013 about being left homeless just before the exam season started, about my landlord suddenly selling off our house moments after we'd paid the deposit. But I'm sure you've heard it all before \u2013 when I asked other students for their experiences, I found my situation was far from uncommon.</p> <p>One example comes from Edward in Leicester, he battled with mice infestations, bursting pipes and mouldy walls. His letting agency's customer service wasn't great either, he says: \"At one point they phoned my parents complaining about the state of the bathroom and claiming that when they had spoken to me the weekend before I had been dismissive and rude. My mum then pointed out that I had been home the whole weekend as my grandmother had died. They didn't contact us for a while after that about it.\"</p> <p>Talking to estate agents and landlords can feel like hitting your head against a brick wall. Some assume that all students are naive pushovers, others avoid your complaints hoping that you'll eventually give up and go away.</p> <p>To stop this, I suggest <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/title/landlord%20and%20tenant%20act\" title=\"\">brushing up on the law</a>. If you find legal waffle baffling then ask a law student to help you out or visit your local Citizens Advice Bureau \u2013 you could even take advantage of the free 15-minute consultations offered by law firms. That's what Edward did, and, after getting free advice from a local lawyer, he discovered that his letting company was acting illegally. As a result, he stopped paying rent for the remainder of his tenancy.</p> <p>If you're choosing a house, try to stick to the university-approved list of landlords. Scout around and get an idea of the average prices for your area. If you find a place that matches your budget make sure you read the tenancy agreement before you sign anything.</p> <p>Here's what to look out for. According to the housing charity <a href=\"http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/renting_and_leasehold/renting_agreements#6\" title=\"\">Shelter</a>, your contract shouldn't contain any unfair clauses, so it can't state: \"the landlord can change the terms of the agreement whenever s/he likes.\" Nor should it say that you have to pay for, or arrange, structural repairs \u2014 these are the landord's responsibility.</p> <p>Always check that the landlord is enrolled on a <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/homeandcommunity/privaterenting/tenancies/dg_189120\" title=\"\">Deposit Protection Scheme</a>. It emerged recently that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/jun/20/tenants-landlords-dragging-feet-deposits\" title=\"\">some landlords are not doing so</a>, even though they are compelled to by law. Don't let them get away with it.</p> <p>Make sure you keep or make a note of all payments and correspondences you have with your estate agent and landlord. It will come in handy if they dispute your version of events.</p> <p>Also, keep your parents in the loop, they have far more experience of complaining about things than you \u2013 let them hassle the property owner too.</p> <p>And finally, if you do have problems, don't let it stress you out too much. As long as the roof is still over your head you can usually still enjoy a happy home. Fight the landlords, but don't let the battle envelop your life.</p>",
  "<p>Are you fed up with found footage? Think it's time the stratagem was moved up to the next level? You may even see the whole thing as a pointless gimmick. Prepare to be knocked out. The Bay bursts through the home-video barrier to present not the record from a single camcorder but a comprehensive montage of the different kinds of audiovisual data, public and private, that were generated by the events it portrays. In so doing, it offers a fresh and arresting insight into the way we're now documenting our history.</p> <p>That's point one. Point two is that the terror evoked this time doesn't depend on fantasy fears about ghosts, aliens, cannibals or zombies. It's prompted by phenomena that could actually occur, or almost have done, and should therefore scare the rationally oriented even more than timorous types. This is horror for grown-ups.</p> <p>Donna (played note-perfectly by Kether Donohue) is a novice journalist putting together a video expos\u00e9 of a scandal that has been suppressed by the authorities. Three years earlier, she was a callow intern covering Fourth of July celebrations in a small Maryland seaside resort for local TV. The sun shone, children paddled and contestants in a crab-eating competition cheerily threw up.</p> <p>Then some of the frolickers came out in rashes. These turned into blisters, boils and appalling lesions, resulting in horrible agony and a disgusting death. The condition spread and hospitals were overwhelmed; the disease control centre was baffled. It turned out that the culprit was a primitive fish parasite that had developed a taste for humans.</p> <p>Hundreds of tonnes of steroid-rich excrement dumped into the sea from a local chicken farm had caused the mutation. Warnings of potential risks had been ignored and, even as the body count mounted, officialdom was denying the danger. Eventually, the town was quarantined, the critters were exterminated, the surviving townspeople were bribed to keep their mouths shut and the whole incident was hushed up.</p> <p>Now Donna is blowing the gaff by aggregating her tapes from the day with an imposing array of CCTV and webcam footage, emergency service vehicle recordings, Skype conference calls between panicking officials, TV news output, video from deceased holidaymakers' cameraphones, and much else. It's not clear how she got hold of this stuff; the Pulitzer judges will clearly be pretty impressed. Nonetheless, it all makes for a compulsively gripping tale.</p> <p>Jaws may come to mind, but this time the found footage really does create the feeling of authenticity for which its originator must have hoped and of which Steven Spielberg could only dream. You can smell both the salt in the sea air and the different varieties of fear that course through the veins of victims, relatives, doctors, policemen and officials. In comparison, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/20/contagion-film-review\" title=\"\">Steven Soderbergh's Contagion</a>, which may come to mind, seems absurdly stilted and stagey.</p> <p>The Bay's persuasiveness is down not just to its narrative method but to acute observation and precise writing. There's at least one top 10 scary moment, when the mini-beast (literally) jumps the species gap from fish to human. Still, the film is no mere genre curiosity. You don't have to be into horror to find it disturbing. The story isn't that far-fetched: in Chesapeake Bay, where the film is set, a <a href=\"http://edgewater.patch.com/articles/on-the-trail-of-the-chesapeakes-dead-zone-68aca56a\" title=\"\">100-mile stretch of the main channel already becomes a dead zone every summer</a>.</p> <p>All the same, The Bay played at Toronto only in the Midnight Madness strand. Here at San Sebasti\u00e1n, it isn't in competition for the Golden Shell, though it could knock spots off some of the candidates. Yet the film's merits should hardly come as that much of a surprise, in view of its provenance.</p> <p>The Bay wasn't made by a horror hack. It was directed by no less a figure than Barry Levinson, who has behind him <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/79095/rain.man\" title=\"\">Rain Man</a>, Sleepers, Good Morning, Vietnam, and Diner. Levinson has always been acutely interested in the minutiae of human behaviour, and it's this concern that makes The Bay the triumph that it is.</p> <p>Brilliant films that are not easily pigeon-holed often have to struggle for recognition. So far, The Bay has secured a release in America and the Netherlands. Let's hope this proves to be a contagion that spreads.</p>",
  "<p>Human rights are the most powerful tool to ensure efforts against hunger and malnutrition tackle structural causes and are not reduced to short-term strategies, civil society groups said in a report published on Tuesday.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rtfn-watch.org/\" title=\"\">Who Decides About Global Food and Nutrition? \u2013 Strategies to Regain Control</a> argues that it is impossible to combat the causes of hunger while keeping existing power relations untouched.</p> <p>\"Food and power are related. It is almost impossible to find one person among the powerful in society and politics worldwide who does not have enough to eat,\" said Huguette Akplogan-Dossa, regional co-ordinator of the African Network on the Right to Food (ANoRF). \"The tendency is for exclusion from economic and political decision-making to go hand in hand with incidences of hunger and malnutrition.\"</p> <p>The report expresses particular concern about the increasing influence and control of agribusinesses and financial companies over food and nutrition.</p> <p>\"Far too often, agribusinesses and nutrition companies use their weight and influence to increase their profit margins, and to manipulate the rules to their interests and convenience, without regard for the best interests of small-scale food producers and the survival of their communities \u2013 let alone the moral and legal requirements of the human right to food,\" said Peter Prove, executive director of the Ecumenical Advocacy Alliance.</p> <p>The report points to a faultline in how to deal with food security \u2013 access to safe and nutritious food. There is the \"mainstream approach\" favoured by governments and international organisations, such as Agra, Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, and backed by the Gates Foundation, which focuses on technocratic approaches \u2013 better seeds and technology \u2013 to boost productivity and access to markets. This week, Agra is holding a <a href=\"http://www.agrforum.com/index.php\" title=\"\">forum in Arusha, Tanzania, on plans for developing Africa's agricultural sector</a>.</p> <p>However, the civil society groups behind the fifth annual report on the right to food and nutrition put the emphasis on a rights-based approach. They say an agricultural system that features large US and EU farm subsidies, along with a concentration of power among a few grain giants such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jul/18/us-multinationals-control-food-aid\" title=\"\">ADM, Cargill and Bunge (the main corporate beneficiaries of US food aid)</a>, contribute to food insecurity in poor countries.</p> <p>\"Allowing decision-making to be in the hands of a powerful but reduced group has led to a centralised model of food supply, which in many cases results in famines, political abuse, or infringement on the state's basic obligations when it comes to human rights: to respect, protect and fulfil them,\" the report says.</p> <p>The report sees negative corporate influence at work in the <a href=\"http://www.scalingupnutrition.org/\" title=\"\">Scaling Up Nutrition</a> (Sun) initiative, involving a $2.9bn plan to promote good nutritional practices with $6.2bn on preventing and treating malnutrition with special foods. Backed by the UN, the scheme has the support of <a href=\"http://www.gainhealth.org/\" title=\"\">Gain</a>, the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition. Gain's partners include food giants such as PepsiCo, Kraft and Danone.</p> <p>The UN special rapporteur on the right to food, Olivier de Schutter, while welcoming the progress on Sun, has pointed out how the private sector tries to use technical solutions for what are fundamentally social problems. De Schutter has called on countries committed to scaling up nutrition to begin by regulating the marketing of commercial infant formula and other breast-milk substitutes. He has also noted the tension between a strategy that promotes processed foods, enriched with nutrients to the point that diets become \"medicalised\", and one that promotes local and regional food systems, as well as a shift towards less heavily processed and more nutritious food.</p> <p>A chapter in the report, written by Marcos Arana Cede\u00f1o and Xaviera Cabada, cites the vigorous promotion of soft drinks on school premises in Mexico by companies \u2013 endorsed by many school authorities, which provide space for sales and advertising in exchange for school supplies or financial benefits. They note the serious problems in Mexico's regions with large indigenous populations, where obesity rates are growing faster within the poorest quintile.</p> <p>\"It is precisely in these indigenous regions where the most aggressive and unregulated marketing practices of sweetened soft drinks take place,\" the authors write. These practices include a 35% price cut, promotion in Spanish and indigenous languages, and numerous sales outlets within and around schools.</p> <p>Civil society groups are making themselves heard on the issues surrounding food security and hunger. After years of negotiations involving governments, international organisations and civil society groups <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/mar/14/negotiators-consensus-global-land-governance-guidelines\" title=\"\">under the UN's Committee on World Food Security</a>. The body officially endorsed the <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/tenure/voluntary-guidelines/en/\" title=\"\">voluntary guidelines on the responsible governance of tenure of land, fisheries and forests</a> in the context of national food security.</p> <p>The guidelines promote secure tenure rights and equitable access to land, fisheries and forests as a means of eradicating hunger and poverty, supporting sustainable development and enhancing the environment. They contain provisions to protect local communities, indigenous peoples and vulnerable groups from land speculation and land concentration.</p> <p>\"With the reform of the Committee on World Food Security, an innovative way of inclusive governance has been established. It has been a breakthrough for those civil society groups that traditionally have been excluded from decision-making processes on all levels,\" said Flavio Valente, secretary general of advocacy group Fian International.</p>",
  "<p>It's difficult for people of my generation to separate GoldenEye the film from GoldenEye the computer game. The 1997 Nintendo shoot-em-up was so aggressively brilliant it had its own pandemic addiction dream: everything pixelated and seen beyond the jutting snout of an AK-47 assault rifle. I suffered from it, on and off, for months; I know others did too. But for a moment let's pretend GoldenEye the game never existed \u2013 take yourself, gamers of the late 90s, to that dark place. GoldenEye the film was a smasher, and for me a franchise peak.</p> <p>It introduced us to a new James Bond, the fifth, first met wearing a baggy black playsuit and running along the top of a dam. Where were we? Hundreds of feet above a Soviet munitions factory. A swan dive, a bungee rope, and a grappling-hook gun with laser cutter attachment got our agent inside. We didn't get a good look at him until he crawled into a communal toilet to waylay a henchman. \"Sorry,\" he purred, the accent faintly Irish, a tanned and leathery face coming into view, \"forgot to knock.\" It was Pierce Brosnan! Only just holding back a smile, and quipping while he clobbered enemies exactly as Bond should. (For comparison we first glimpsed Timothy Dalton as 007, in 1987's The Living Daylights, playing paintball in Gibraltar. Literally his first close-up involved getting frightened by a monkey.)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HHFXthl5IJo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HHFXthl5IJo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHFXthl5IJo\">Reading this on a mobile? Click here to watch video</a></p> <p>GoldenEye's pre-credit sequence never let up. Bond met another 00 agent, played by Sean Bean, and watched \u2013 guh \u2013 as his pal was shot in the head. Next he evaded a militia by driving a motorbike off a cliff. Between cliff-top and cliff-bottom, he somehow commandeered a plane. The film was only minutes old, and already there were so many outrageous action scenes to deconstruct with friends. The big-casino voice of Tina Turner sung over the credits. There'd been one-liners, gadgets, wasted vehicles, inept communists ...</p> <p>And this is how we're best off rating Bond films, I think \u2013 by check-box. Does this or that instalment have a cool pre-credit sequence? Are you able to give the theme song a passable rendering in the shower without re-Googling the lyrics? Does the baddie have a lair? Is there a memorable assistant villain? How plausible is Bond's feature-length pairing with an attractive female civilian? How shocking the inevitable moment of his betrayal (by friend, helper, squeeze)? Does he do something strenuous, dirty or violent and still remain immaculate in a suit? Does he notch more air miles than a golf pro, and desecrate the local architecture in at least one famous city?</p> <p>By these major criteria and by many other minor ones \u2013 the sort that operate on an almost subliminal level of Bond-movie gratification \u2013 GoldenEye was immediately a winner for me. Its plot took 007 from Russia to Monte Carlo, back to St Petersburg and then to the Cuban jungle. St Petersburg got the worst of it. Bond, joy-riding in a tank, spent six expensive minutes smashing the place to pieces. Playing cards in Monte Carlo he encountered a cigar-smoking murderess with a cartoon-y name, Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), several times a threat to his life. Strapped into a helicopter that was programmed to fire missiles at itself \u2013 an absolute classic in the sub-category of the needlessly elongated death sentence \u2013 Bond met a much nicer girl, Izabella Scorupco's Natalya, who wore sensible clothes. His chief antagonist had an Evil Train, and the train had a special Bond-murdering carriage. Of course this baddie had a lair.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396703073\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Archive/Search/2012/9/25/1348589319647/GoldenEye-010.jpg\" alt=\"GoldenEye\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sensible clothing ...

Here factored the betrayal. It was Bean, shot in the head in the film's early minutes, but still alive, and returned to torment Her Majesty's Secret Servant because as a secret Russian he secretly hated England. Bean, in the character of Alec Trevelyan, got all the best lines: florid and doomed boasting, plus taunts about Bond's easy womanising and his capacity for unfeeling henchman-genocide over the years. He conjured an image of a possible funeral for 007, \"a small memorial service, with only Moneypenny and a few tearful restaurateurs in attendance\". Yes!</p> <p>The film is not perfect. Product placement reached unprecedentedly squalid levels, with Bond regularly brandishing his Omega Seamaster to no purpose, and in the chase scene driving his tank through a branded stack of mineral water. The two principals sometimes got into trouble with their RP; Co Louth-born Brosnan at one point rendering \"Come on! Now!\" as \"Camah! Nargh-uh!\", and Yorkshire's Bean so intent on being menacingly posh he kept saying \"Jems\" for \"James\". The film's sexual politics were, of course, confused. Heroine Natalya, presented as a firebrand who could look after herself, hack computers, load a semi automatic, etc, had an unfunny running joke in which she nagged Bond for not being chivalrous enough. And in one scene a torrent of bullets deflected, with ping noises, off a chain-link fence.</p> <p>But I can forgive it. GoldenEye is the best Bond, confirmed by its superiority in the most important category of all, the lavishness of the villain's execution. Sean Connery ensured that Auric Goldfinger, in 1964, got sucked out of an aeroplane window. Roger Moore condemned Hugo Drax, in 1979's Moonraker, to a lonely death in space. In GoldenEye, Brosnan's Bond dropped Bean's Trevelyan many hundred feet on to concrete. The fall was not quite fatal for the villain \u2013 until a satellite the size of a tennis court landed on him. Pointy-end first. Aflame. Bean got in a last hopeless scream while Brosnan exited the scene, dangling from the bottom of a helicopter, his girl at the controls.</p> <p>Within the limits of the Bond universe, this was actual poetry.</p> <p><strong>Best line:</strong> Trevelyan [challenged by Bond about his motives]: \"Oh, please, James! Spare me the Freud. I might as well ask you if all the vodka martinis ever silence the screams of all the men you've killed. Or if you find forgiveness in the arms of all those willing women for all the dead ones you failed to protect.\"</p> <p><strong>Best gadget: </strong>Bond's ballpoint pen \u2013 also a \"class four grenade\", armed by pushing its clicky top three times. Used to devastating effect, late on, in a massacre of computer programmers at the baddie's lair.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 September.

  "<p>Although this book is described by the author as a \"microhistory\", it is crammed with so many unexpected surprises that it almost seems it should be a work of fiction.

Although Tenducci is nearly unknown today, he was an international musical superstar, his fame rivalling that of Elvis, the Beatles, Elton John and Britney Spears. The son of a poor Italian servant, Tenducci lived a rags-to-riches story at a time when social mobility was even more difficult than it is today; he travelled eighteenth-century Europe, sang music that J. C. Bach and Mozart composed especially for him, performed for royalty and for wealthy patrons and popularised Italian opera along the way. Surprisingly for those sexually repressed times, Tenducci also developed a massive following of female admirers. </p> <p>Dorothea Maunsell was born into a wealthy Irish family and she had an extraordinary singing voice, so exquisite that her father hired Tenducci to be his teenaged daughter's singing teacher. But women were rarely allowed to perform in public, so Dorothea's dedication to voice lessons seemed rather a waste since she had no real future as a singer or as anything else, except as a wife and mother. But the opera star and his student spent a lot of time together, and became very fond of each other. Since Tenducci was a castrato, whose very humanity was sometimes questioned, their close relationship did not raise eyebrows. But when Dorothea's control-freak father arranged a marriage for her with a man she did not at all like, she acted on the one option that was open to her: she eloped with her teacher. </p> <p>Predictably, all hell broke loose. Dorothea's father, a lawyer, claimed Tenducci kidnapped his precious daughter and was holding her prisoner in another country. Indeed, Dorothea and her husband did flee Ireland to escape her father, then England to escape Tenducci's debts (and debtor's prison). They fled to Italy, where they were well-received. In Italy, Dorothea sometimes accompanied her husband as a performer onstage, and occasionally replaced him when he was traveling -- a dream come true, it would seem. </p> <p>Throughout all this drama, Dorothea wrote and published what is probably one of the first ever teenage novels describing her love affair with Tenducci. Yet at the same time, Dorothea fell in love with another man. Her marriage failed. Tenducci was heartbroken, but Dorothea was practical. She even sought her father's help in dissolving the marriage so she could marry her new lover. </p> <p>A highly publicized battle ensued in the London courts where the marriage was finally annulled. The argument centered on Tenducci's state of being a castrato, since he could not possibly consummate the marriage and father children. </p> <p>I was saddened to learn that the eighteenth-century equivalent of today's rock superstars can be so completely forgotten that only a handful of people alive today even recognise his name. I also was sad to realise that amongst the women of her day, Dorothea was one of the very few lucky ones because she was not completely invisible whilst she was alive. </p> <p>The Castrato and his wife is a readable book that relies on scholarly detective work and strong narrative to tell this tragic tale. It presents fascinating insight into the world of opera, the Catholic church, and into the nature of sex and marriage in Georgian Britain. Further, the author explores questions about the meaning of marriage that resonate to this very day. </p> <p>If you enjoy European history or if you are an opera fan, or if you enjoy reading strange-but-true stories, there is much in this compelling book that will appeal to you. </p> <p>.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.ncl.ac.uk/historical/staff/profile/helen.berry\">Helen Berry</a></strong> is Reader in Early Modern History at Newcastle University.

  "<p>Based on past form, the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who is due to address the UN general assembly on Wednesday, will unleash a tirade against global governance sprinkled with theological lessons, insist on his country's nuclear rights, denounce sanctions and make incendiary statements on Israel.</p> <p>No matter how familiar his themes might sound, he can be confident that he still has the capacity to grab international headlines and stage an event that will cause both outrage and possibly some amusement in western circles.</p> <p>In his final year in office, the 56-year-old president has increasingly become a lame duck. And Wednesday's speech will probably be his last chance to exploit a high-profile international platform. Under Iranian law, Ahmadinejad cannot run for a third term and is due to stand down in June 2013.</p> <p>He appears to have surpassed himself with preparations, taking more than 100 people with him to the US, a move that has infuriated his critics back home and even caused uproar among the country's parliamentarians. Iranian MP Mansour Haghighatpour has criticised the president for his large entourage, saying that many have accompanied him to New York for \"a picnic\".</p> <p>Ahmadinejad's opponents in Iran are closely watching him in New York, wary of any impact his words might have on the future of their country, which is suffering from financial stringency owing to international isolation over Tehran's disputed nuclear programme.</p> <p>Conservatives suspect Ahmadinejad might use his UN appearance to bolster his political status in Iran by portraying a president still much in control. After suffering a series of setbacks in a power struggle, Ahmadinejad and his team have lost a great deal of influence over Iranian politics. The opposition is worried the president's UN speech might exacerbate the country's political and financial situation.</p> <p>Those watching outside have their eyes on any hint of a change in policy over Tehran's nuclear activities or its unwavering support for Syria's Bashar al-Assad's regime, subjects that are likely to be mentioned in his speech.</p> <p>On the nuclear issue, Ahmadinejad may choose to highlight the recent assassinations of a handful of Iranian scientists, attempting to portray Iran as a victim of a western-led campaign against his country's advances in science and technology.</p> <p>Last year, Ahmadinejad caused uproar and provoked a diplomatic walkout by referring to 9/11 as a \"mysterious\" incident that he said was used by the US as a pretext to attack Afghanistan and Iraq. At the time, he also reprimanded the US for killing Osama bin Laden without putting him on trial and then burying his body at sea.</p> <p>\"By using their imperialistic media network, which is under the influence of colonialism, they threaten anyone who questions the Holocaust and the September 11 event with sanctions and military actions,\" he said then.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad's earlier remarks in New York this week, which can hint at the range of subjects he might touch on in his speech, include issues such as the country's nuclear negotiations, the threat of an Israeli military strike, Syria and an Islamophobic film that has triggered protests across the Muslim world.</p> <p>On the threat of war from Israel, Ahmadinejad said his country did not take them seriously. \"We have all the defensive means at our disposal and we are ready to defend ourselves,\" he said.</p> <p>Despite a plea this week by the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, who warned the Iranian president recently to avoid \"incendiary rhetoric\", Ahmadinejad has again used his New York visit to make strongly worded statements about Israel, saying the country had no roots in the Middle East and would be \"eliminated\".</p> <p>A White House spokesman reacted by describing his comments as \"characteristically disgusting, offensive and outrageous\".</p> <p>Ahmadinejad gave an interview with AP on Tuesday in which he spoke of a world where a \"new order\" would inevitably replace the era of what he called US bullying.</p> <p>Earlier in his trip, in an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan, he was questioned on his views on homosexuality. Ahmadinejad said: \"I'm sorry. Let me ask you this. Do you believe that anyone is giving birth through homosexuality? Homosexuality ceases procreation. Who has said that if you like or believe in doing something ugly, and others do not accept your behaviour, that they're denying your freedom?\"</p> <p>In another interview, when asked about an Iranian institute raising the bounty on Salman Rushdie, Ahmadinejad responded: \"Salman Rushdie, where is he now? \u2026 There is no news of him. Is he in the United States? If he is in the US, you shouldn't broadcast that, for his own safety.\"</p> <p>It is perhaps unsurprising then that also accompanying Ahmadinejad's visit to New York have been near-constant demonstrations in front of his hotel and at the UN headquarters.</p>",
  "<p>Did you know that during the Holocaust, the Nazis ran a <a href=\"http://samedifference1.com/2012/08/10/nicky-clark-on-the-nazis-and-disability/\" title=\"\">euthanasia programme</a>, known as T4, that began as a way of cleansing Germany of \"undesirable\" disabled children?</p> <p>In mainstream secondary school history lessons about the Holocaust, no teacher ever told me this. The only clue I got about the Nazis attitude towards disabled people was when I was told that in a concentration camp, I would have been sent straight to the gas chambers, because I couldn't have done any physical work.</p> <p>Considering everything I had been told about the Nazis, I wasn't surprised. I do wish the T4 programme had been mentioned at school, though. Because no teacher ever hesitated to tell me that the Holocaust was about killing Jewish people.</p> <p>Did you know anything about how disabled slaves were treated? I had never even thought about this until I heard a speech about it last year. Yet when my teachers told me about the slave trade, they never hesitated to tell me it was about white people owning black people who were made to work in their houses for free.</p> <p>Did you know that King George VI had a very serious stammer? I didn't, until I watched <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAm7gRXFiRo\" title=\"\">The King's Speech</a>. Yet no history teacher ever hesitated to tell me that King George VI was the father of the present Queen, Elizabeth II.</p> <p>Did you know that Prince Philip's mother was born deaf? I didn't, until I watched a very good recent documentary about her life, <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-queens-mother-in-law/episode-guide/series-1/episode-1\" title=\"\">The Queen's Mother In Law</a>. This programme also revealed that she had severe mental health issues.</p> <p>After the possible discovery of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/sep/23/richard-3rd-third-iii-leicster-bones\" title=\"\">skeleton of King Richard III</a> and the revelation that he had scoliosis (curvature of the spine), I was informed by someone who has read Shakespeare's play Richard III that his disability is mentioned often throughout the script, but I had never been told about it in a history lesson.</p> <p>This made me realise that mainstream secondary schools teach children hardly anything about the disability links in history. As a disabled person, I believe that this should change.</p> <p>Just as lessons about the Holocaust were aimed at reducing religious discrimination, just as lessons about slavery were aimed at reducing racial discrimination, I believe that teaching children how disabled people were treated in important periods of history, or that historical figures were disabled, might just reduce disability discrimination, or maybe even disability hate crimes, in the future.</p> <p>That's why I have recently launched a campaign called Old Is Gold to get disability links taught in history lessons in schools. I have started up an <a href=\"http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/38847\" title=\"\">e-petition</a> on the government website. If it gets enough support, I hope the idea might get debated in parliament.</p> <p>If this campaign interests you, you can also follow it on Facebook at <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/TeachDisabilityLinksInHistoryLessonsOldIsGold\" title=\"\">Teach Disability Links in History Lessons \u2013 Old is Gold</a>.</p> <p>Finally, if you know of an important historical figure who was disabled, please leave a comment below.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-social-care-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the social care network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://2012.coop/en/un-international-year\" title=\"\">UN's International Year of Co-operatives</a> reaches its climax next month with two high-profile events which \u2013 if they work as their organisers hope \u2013 could see the co-operative movement globally set on a radical programme of change.</p> <p>The major Canadian co-operative bank and insurer <a href=\"http://www.desjardins.com/en/\" title=\"\">Desjardins</a> is hosting the <a href=\"http://www.2012intlsummit.coop/\" title=\"\">2012 International Summit of Co-operatives</a> in its home city of Qu\u00e9bec. The conference, taking place from 9 to 11 October, has lined up a formidable list of participants from co-ops around the world, with the emphasis focused on how the co-operative business model can more successfully challenge conventional business. Desjardins' president and chief executive Monique Leroux is upbeat about the prospects. \"Co-operatives are part of the solution in establishing a more solid economic and financial system,\" she says. \"Co-operative and mutual enterprise is the financial business model of the future and the key to sustainable prosperity.\"</p> <p>Desjardins has commissioned a series of <a href=\"http://www.2012intlsummit.coop/site/summit-program/studies\" title=\"\">independent studies</a> on aspects of co-operative management, including a major report from consultancy firm <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/\" title=\"\">McKinsey</a>. McKinsey's findings, to be unveiled on 10 October, are expected to identify co-operatives' strengths relative to PLCs, and areas of organisational and managerial weakness. A separate study, undertaken by <a href=\"http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_US/us/index.htm\" title=\"\">Deloitte</a>, will explore issues around co-operative financial and capitalisation, a major area of debate in co-operative circles in recent years.</p> <p>Co-operatives work very closely with mutual businesses in francophone Canada, and the Qu\u00e9bec summit will also provide an opportunity for the <a href=\"http://2012.coop/welcome\" title=\"\">International Co-operative Alliance (ICA)</a> to announce its plans to bring mutuals more closely into the co-op family internationally. Dame Pauline Green, the past chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.uk.coop/\" title=\"\">Co-operatives UK</a> and current ICA president, will introduce a joint declaration of co-operatives and mutuals, which will be launched at the end of the event.</p> <p>Also on the agenda are discussions on, among other things, improving co-operative governance, on ways of integrating co-operative values into management practice, and closer alliances between co-operative businesses.</p> <p>Manchester takes over from Qu\u00e9bec three weeks later when the very ambitious <a href=\"http://www.manchester2012.coop/\" title=\"\">Co-operatives United</a> event will occupy Manchester Central, the city's main conference hall complex, from 29 October to 2 November. Co-operatives United, which is a joint initiative of Co-operatives UK, <a href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/\" title=\"\">the Co-operative Group</a> and the ICA, is a multi-headed beast of an event, including a co-op trade fair, stalls and workshops as well as an exhibition on the theme of co-operative living. The annual UK Co-operative congress also piggybacks on the event, on 1 November.</p> <p>However it will be the ICA general assembly, taking place in Manchester on 31 October, that will decide how the movement internationally carries forward the impetus which the 2012 year has given. The plan, according to ICA director-general <a href=\"http://charlesgould.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Chuck Gould</a>, is to convert one year of activity into ten. \"Co-operators are doing something with 'our Year' that others haven't done with theirs. We are attempting to leverage it from a Year into a Decade,\" he told his blog followers earlier this month. By 2020, he hopes, co-operatives will have become the preferred way for new businesses to be created.</p> <p>This ambitious proposal will be presented to the ICA general assembly in the form of the Blueprint for a Co-operative Decade, a detailed strategic plan for the ICA and the broader co-op movement. This document, prepared by a ICA work group and written by Cliff Mills and Will Davies from the <a href=\"http://www.kellogg.ox.ac.uk/MEOB\" title=\"\">Centre for Mutual and Employee-owned Business</a> at the University of Oxford, addresses some of the issues which are currently problematic for co-ops. Action is proposed to improve member engagement and corporate governance and to strengthen the idea of what precisely constitutes a co-operative. A third aim is to work to improve the legislative frameworks under which co-operatives operate in different countries.</p> <p>The blueprint also picks up recent work on the need for more diverse sources of capital for co-operatives, under the slogan \"secure reliable co-operative capital while guaranteeing member control\". The blueprint recognises that the inability of co-ops to access conventional equity can limit growth. (Indeed some co-operatives worldwide have chosen to establish part-controlled publicly quoted trading companies to overcome this problem, representing a potentially significant weakening of the co-operative ethos). The blueprint calls for new financial instruments which attract investor capital but which \"do not impair or undermine the co-operative nature of the entity\". The proposal is extremely timely, though quite how this trick can be pulled off is by no means clear.</p> <p>The fifth and final area for strategic focus, according to the blueprint, is in relation to sustainability, the aim being to position co-operatives as businesses which are economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. This part of the blueprint links directly to another issue on the ICA general assembly's agenda, that of the proposal to rewrite the last of the seven internationally agreed <a href=\"http://2012.coop/en/what-co-op/co-operative-identity-values-principles\" title=\"\">Co-operative Principles</a>. The seventh principle is the nearest the co-operative movement gets to any sort of ethical statement, and is at present embarrassingly weak, simply asserting that \"co-operatives work for the sustainable development of their communities through policies approved by their members\". The move to toughen up this wording was first proposed at the ICA general assembly last year and delegates this year will be told how the ICA plans to carry this work forward.</p> <p>The blueprint for a \"Co-operative Decade\" represents the first concerted attempt for a generation to rebuild the international co-operative movement on a platform which is both business-focused and ethical. Although the work group has had representation from Canada, Kenya and China, there is a clear sense of strong UK input. Indeed it could be argued that the blueprint is trying to achieve globally the same cultural and organisational reform of the co-operative movement which the 2000-2001 Co-operative Commission was instrumental in bringing about in Britain.</p> <p>There are, however, plenty of other issues bubbling under which may emerge at Qu\u00e9bec and Manchester. One is potentially controversial: it is whether co-operatives should endorse a maximum pay differential between their highest and lowest paid workers. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's recent proposal to limit pay differentials to 1:20 in the French public sector makes this highly topical. Another is the suggestion that co-ops should endorse good working practices for their employees by signing up en masse to the core labour standards adopted by the UN's <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/introduction-to-international-labour-standards/lang--en/index.htm\" title=\"\">International Labour Organisation</a>.</p> <p>There are certainly plenty of less than ethical goings-on in some co-operatives worldwide which should shame the movement. Nevertheless there is a real sense that things are moving forward in the once almost moribund world of international cooperation. As the blueprint puts it, \"rarely has the argument in favour of co-operatives looked stronger than it does in 2012. But unless there is concerted action over the next few years, the moment will be lost. By 2020, we need to be able to look back on 2012 as representing a turning point for the co-operative movement.\"</p> <p><em>Andrew Bibby is a professional writer and journalist</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>I was amused by Conal Urquhart's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/16/mdma-drug-experiment-channel-4\" title=\"\">description in the Observer</a> of the novelist Lionel Shriver being sucked into an MRI brain scanner \"that resembles a giant washing machine\". I see her tumbling around with the rest of the laundry, including actor Keith Allen and former MP Evan Harris, to emerge bright and uplifted.</p> <p>The three of them were participants in a brain imaging study into the effects of MDMA (\"ecstasy\") on brain function, parts of which will be televised on Channel 4's <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/drugs-live-the-ecstasy-trial\" title=\"\">Drugs Live</a> documentary on Wednesday and Thursday night.</p> <p>Harris, who is also a doctor, said the trial could \"pave the way to further research into potential therapeutic uses of MDMA, such as in the treatment of PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder]\". But others have raised doubts. Urquhart quoted a Home Office spokesman as saying that \"televising the use of illegal drugs risks trivialising a serious issue\".</p> <p>Surely, though, developing improved treatments for severe health problems is also a serious issue?</p> <p>Readers may remember my article earlier this year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/feb/06/magic-mushrooms-law-war-drugs\" title=\"\">about a similar brain-imaging study on psilocybin</a>, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms. The research formed part of the Beckley Foundation/Imperial College Psychopharmacological Research Programme, a collaboration between the <a href=\"http://www.beckleyfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Beckley Foundation</a>, which I founded and direct, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/david-nutt\" title=\"\">Professor David Nutt's</a> group at Imperial College. The MDMA study featured in Channel 4's Drugs Live is a continuation of that programme.</p> <p>Contrary to expectations, psilocybin decreased cerebral blood flow, particularly to brain regions that act as \"connector hubs\" responsible for filtering and co-ordinating the flow of information through the brain. These hubs impose a top-down control on our awareness, integrating sensory inputs and prior expectations into a coherent, organised and censored experience of the world. By reducing blood supply to the hubs, and thereby decreasing their activity, psilocybin allows a freer, less constrained state of awareness to emerge.</p> <p>This finding provides a neuroscientific underpinning for the metaphor of the brain as a \"reducing valve\" whose censoring activity is turned down by psychedelics \u2013 an idea popularised by the novelist Aldous Huxley in his 1954 essay <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doors_of_Perception\" title=\"\">The Doors of Perception</a>.</p> <p>Besides providing insights into consciousness and brain function, the results from our psilocybin studies highlight important new therapeutic possibilities. One of the hubs throttled back by psilocybin is known to be chronically overactive in depression. By lowering the activity of this region, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jan/23/magic-mushrooms-psilocybin-depression-drug\" title=\"\">psilocybin may allow the unremitting ruminative thought patterns that underlie depression to be reset</a>. On the back of this finding, the Medical Research Council has awarded a major grant for a study of psilocybin in the treatment of severely depressed patients, which has just begun.</p> <p>Psilocybin reduces the blood supply and activity of another \"connector hub\", which is overactive in cluster headaches. Cluster, nicknamed the \"suicide headache\" because it is so agonising, is notoriously difficult to treat \u2013 though anecdotal evidence suggests that psilocybin and LSD provide relief. Unfortunately, patients currently have to obtain these substances illegally, without the benefit of medical advice and supervision.</p> <p>As these results prove, brain imaging research can add invaluable insights to knowledge gained from other scientific and clinical fields. The new MDMA research aims to do just that.</p> <p>Growing out of the Beckley/Imperial psilocybin research, the MDMA work also uses <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging\" title=\"\">fMRI</a> to monitor activity in different parts of the brain, and compares the effects of the drug with those of an inactive placebo.</p> <p>MDMA is a pure form of the club drug ecstasy, which is often contaminated with other substances. The drug used in these studies is held legally under a Home Office licence (so Channel 4 is not \"televising the use of illegal drugs\"). The MDMA is administered at a controlled dose, with informed consent, using procedures for which we have gained ethical approval.</p> <p>Our brain imaging research complements <a href=\"http://www.maps.org/research/mdma/mdma_ptsd_u.s._study_veterans_of_war/\" title=\"\">work in progress</a> in America into the efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as a treatment for PTSD: the participants include war veterans, police officers and firefighters. The research is urgent because Pentagon statistics <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/08/suicide-rise-us-military\" title=\"\">released in June</a> show suicides among active troops running at about one per day, significantly outnumbering combat deaths.</p> <p>Our imaging study is still incomplete, but preliminary results provide fascinating insights. After taking MDMA, positive memories were experienced as more vivid than after placebo. Correlating with this subjective experience, MDMA evoked an increased activation of the visual cortex compared with placebo. By contrast, during recollection of negative memories, the brain scans showed a decreased activation under MDMA compared with placebo.</p> <p>Our finding suggests that MDMA may enable PTSD patients to access negative memories without a feeling of overwhelming threat, which could enable subjects to better confront and wash out their traumatic experiences.</p> <p>The scans have also shown that MDMA reduces the connectivity \u2013 that is, the degree of synchronisation \u2013 between two important \"connector hubs\" in the brain that show elevated connectivity in depression. The finding suggests that, like psilocybin, MDMA could be valuable in the treatment of depression, by breaking over-rigid, introspective thinking patterns.</p> <p>Securing funding for research of this kind is not easy. Using MDMA and other controlled drugs for scientific purposes is legal, so long as the appropriate licences are granted and complied with. However, the prohibitionist policies towards psychoactive substances create a strong taboo, which makes many scientists, universities and funding bodies unwilling to become involved.</p> <p>Evan Harris is surely right that research into potentially valuable treatments for serious and intractable conditions should be encouraged. While a small charity like the Beckley Foundation does the best it can to initiate, support and collaborate in scientific research, we need to raise awareness in order to attract further funding.</p> <p>Debate should be fostered, not stifled, so I see the involvement of Channel 4 as serving an important educational purpose. We would have no problem with a documentary investigating how a substance such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pethidine\" title=\"\">pethidine</a> \u2013 a Class A drug like MDMA \u2013 alleviates obstetric pain. Why treat MDMA differently?</p> <p>The illegal status of many psychoactives is a key policy challenge of our time, and seriously interferes with scientific research. Let us hope that before too long, the stain of the taboo will be washed away, and scientific evidence will prevail.</p> <p><em>Amanda Feilding is director of the </em><a href=\"http://www.beckleyfoundation.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Beckley Foundation</em></a><em>, a thinktank working for health-oriented drug policies based on scientific research</em></p>",
  "<p>Should trustees be paid? This question has ruffled feathers in the charity sector and sparked lively debate since Lord Hodgson suggested that charities with incomes above \u00a31m should pay their trustees without permission from the <a href=\"http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Charity Commission</a>.</p> <p>Like me, more than <a href=\"http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/Management/article/1145213/two-thirds-charity-staff-against-trustee-payment-survey-finds/\" title=\"\">two-thirds of charity and voluntary sector staff </a>disagree with Hodgson's recommendation, so where is this idea coming from?&#xa0;</p> <p>I am the chairman of the <a href=\"http://www.visitchurches.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Churches Conservation Trust (CCT)</a>, which has an estate of 342 churches across the UK. It's a relatively complex organisation, and the challenges of maintaining such a large collection of historic buildings means that we must recruit, train and retain groups of highly-skilled volunteers to open our buildings to the public, keep them in good repair and run projects that keep them at the heart of their local communities.</p> <p>Increasingly complicated business models, such as that of the CCT, can bring substantial risks and therefore require skilled boards to take on financial, legal and employment accountability. No doubt, my previous experience in the heritage sector, as commissioner of <a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/\" title=\"\">English Heritage</a> for example, was beneficial. But does that mean I should be paid?</p> <p>Of course not. If I wanted to be paid, I'd work wholly in the commercial sector rather than dilute the values and individuality of the voluntary sector. Motivation is core to the role of a trustee, and for a charity that motivation needs to be about the cause, not the payment \u2013 no matter how big or small the charity is. My motivation stems from my lifelong interest in history, the arts and heritage and being a trustee of various organisations gives me the opportunity to be at the centre of the action.</p> <p>Despite the trust's unique status, my role is similar to that of a chairman at any other charity. I do spend a great deal of time on ambassadorial work and in developing partnerships, which are becoming increasingly important because of constraints on spending.</p> <p>Trustees are not being asked to put in 40 hours a week at the expense of everything else; rather it is important for them to invest their time strategically and effectively to add value where they can. I believe that in an era when we are all seeking to massively expand volunteering, the people at the top need to be leading by example. Trustees as volunteers are a powerful demonstration of a charity's commitment to volunteering.</p> <p>I am keenly aware of the need to attract a wider range of people to trustee jobs: too many of us are ageing, white males. But I believe that the way to reach a wider range of potential trustees is to do a better job of explaining both what our organisations do and of course the responsibilities and satisfactions of trusteeship. It is extraordinarily patronising to suggest, as these proposals implicitly do, that women, young people and members of ethnic minorities will not rise to the occasion unless there is a pay check attached to the job.</p> <p>This is definitely not the time to be talking about measures which would increase costs. Charities are more strapped for cash than ever. Recent figures from the National Council for Voluntary Organisations depict a charity sector struggling with the worst recession for fifty years. The figures show that charities were hit by \u00a32.3bn in rising costs purely as a result of inflation between 2008 and 2010. Surely trustees should be looking to generate income rather than spend it.</p> <p>In fact, all trustees nowadays need to be donors as well as fundraisers for their charity. If we are ourselves giving and asking others to give, what's the point then of paying trustees? Instead of taking a pay packet from the cause we should be supporting it financially. Payment for trustees is a fundamental clash with the needs of modern charities.</p> <p>Hodgson's review tates that the inability to pay trustees is not currently a barrier to recruitment so it is clear that financial reward will not produce more skilful or dedicated trustees. At the CCT our experience has been that if you advertise openly and have a strong cause, there are lots of great candidates out there, none of whom expect to be paid. Good charities don't struggle to attract good trustees.</p> <p><em>Loyd Grossman is chairman of the </em><a href=\"http://www.visitchurches.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Churches Conservation Trust</em></a><em>.

Apple has chosen AutoNavi to provide map services within China. That was a smart move, because AutoNavi is a local Chinese company that provides very detailed maps of China.

  "<p>Coalition plans to introduce a new system of secret courts were thrown into disarray on Tuesday after Liberal Democrat delegates voted overwhelmingly to oppose them, rejecting the advice of Nick Clegg and the party leadership.</p> <p>The vote at the party's conference in Brighton will force the party to go back to the former justice secretary, Ken Clarke, to see if any further compromises can be extracted. Clarke kept responsibility for the legislation despite moving in the reshuffle. It may also have to go to the intelligence services.</p> <p>Liberal Democrat ministers believe the party has misunderstood the proposals, which are currently being scrutinised in the Lords, and claim the bill has already been improved by Clegg since the measures were first issued for consultation.</p> <p>Shami Chakrabarti, the director of Liberty, welcomed the result. \"Liberty fully expects the party in Westminster to vote accordingly alongside Conservative rebels and Her Majesty's opposition,\" she said.</p> <p>Although Liberal Democrat leaders were stressing that the parliamentary party is not totally bound by conference votes, they recognise that the conference voted heavily to throw out the whole section of the bill introducing secret courts.</p> <p>In a passionate debate, opponents argued that the law would allow ministers defending claims to trigger a hidden court procedure and limit public scrutiny of the government and the security services.</p> <p>A number of MPs and senior party figures supported a wrecking amendment that would have robbed the motion of its primary purpose, opponents said. The amendment was defeated, prompting a cheer, hugs and strong applause.</p> <p>The debate centred on the bill's most controversial element \u2013 the extension of secret courts, known as closed material procedures (CMPs), into the civil courts.</p> <p>Opponents believe the powers will enable ministers, rather than judges, to manipulate the way evidence is withheld or presented in the courts \u2013 depriving claimants of a fair trial.</p> <p>Jo Shaw, a former parliamentary candidate who tabled the motion to withdraw from part of the bill, told conference that if passed into law it would allow an unprecedented and deeply flawed system to be implemented in Britain's courts.</p> <p>\"Conference should remember that Kafka's novel was a warning, not a manual,\" she said. \"Secret justice quite simply isn't justice, it is a dangerous perversion of justice. This motion is not saying that all the security services or government officials or police are bad or corrupt. But some may be.</p> <p>\"Some may make mistakes and wish to cover them up. Part two [of the bill] will allow a few bad apples to rot our judicial system from behind closed doors. In simple words, this is a bad bill.</p> <p>\"If you vote for the amendment, which is a wrecking amendment, then we are all responsible for secret courts in civil cases and we won't have anyone else to blame: not Labour, not the Conservatives. This will be Liberal Democrat policy.\"</p> <p>Supporters of the amendment, including two MPs and Lord Wallace, claimed the reform will enable judges to hear a greater range of national security cases.</p> <p>Lord Marks, a peer and QC, said the current system \u2013 where the government must apply for a public interest immunity certificate to allow sensitive material to be excluded \u2013 is itself deeply flawed and needs to be reformed.</p> <p>He said: \"There are some exceptional cases which now cannot get a hearing at all because evidence which is secret cannot be disclosed to a court. CMPs would not just help the government, they would help claimants too. Judges would be able to hear secret evidence helpful to claimants.</p> <p>\"This is a civil liberties issue, but to preserve civil liberties we need cases to be tried and governments to be held to account by judges\".</p> <p>He claimed the government case had been misrepresented. Conference organisers had earlier refused a request from Chakrabarti to address the conference.</p>",
  "<p>Nick Clegg will send an austere message to his party on Wednesday, telling them the Liberal Democrats are willing to impose several more years of spending restraint, are now anchored in the centre ground and are determined never to revert to being a party of protest and opposition.</p> <p>But Clegg's efforts to persuade his party of the virtues of coalition compromise in his keynote speech were dealt a blow when conference delegates, appealing to the party's long liberal traditions, spurned the front bench and voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/25/secret-courts-lib-dem-conference\" title=\"\">to reject the coalition's plans for secret courts</a>.</p> <p>The vote will, at the minimum, require Clegg to go back to the Home Office and intelligence services to seek fresh concessions to the justice and security bill. The conference voted for the entire section of the bill introducing secret courts, or closed material procedure, to be scrapped. It is currently in the Lords and has already come under attack from senior lawyers.</p> <p>The defeat represented an awkward overture to Clegg's main conference speech, especially a long passage in which he is expected to hail the way the party had confounded received wisdom by showing it was capable of making the transition from opposition to the discipline of government.</p> <p>Clegg will try to persuade the electorate the party has changed irretrievably, saying: \"The past is gone and it isn't coming back. If voters want a party of opposition \u2013 a 'stop the world I want to get off' party \u2013 they have got plenty of options, but we are not one of them.\"</p> <p>He will say the party only has a meaningful future as one of the three parties of government, not as a third party.</p> <p>He will admit he knows there are \"some in the party who faced with several more years of spending restraint would rather turn back, than press on, break our deal with the Conservatives, give up on the coalition and present ourselves to the electorate in 2015 as a party unchanged\".</p> <p>He will acknowledge this may be an alluring prospect for some, but \"gone would be the difficult choices, the hard decisions the necessary compromises\".</p> <p>He will declare: \"The choice between the party we were and the party we are becoming is a false one. The past is gone and is not coming back\" .</p> <p>The leadership's aim is to try to bookend Clegg's week by starting with the ground-clearing apology for making the fateful populist promise on tuition fees, and then conclude it with a vision of a party now capable of taking the difficult, painful decisions. Clegg will highlight the decisions to reduce the deficit by a quarter saying it has laid the foundations for a stronger and more balanced economy.</p> <p>He will also explicitly link his own party's fortunes to the fate of the economy saying the \"success of each depends on the success of the other\".</p> <p>Clegg will also use his speech to announce \u00a350m in catch-up classes to help children who have underperformed in English and maths at Key Stage 2.</p> <p>He will claim the measure goes to the root of the party's philosophical core. He defines this as \"the freedom to be who you are. The opportunity to be who you could be. That is essence is the Liberal promise\".</p> <p>Clegg's leadership has been unchallenged at this conference but there are fears that such an explicit centre ground strategy may unnecessarily endanger seats at the next election. It causes private unease among some of his cabinet colleagues if it also entails, as Clegg sometimes suggests, permanently giving up on leftwing former Lib Dem voters who have switched to Labour.</p> <p>The cabinet members believe that in many Liberal Democrat seats, an anti-Tory tactical vote can still be reactivated, and it would be foolish to spurn such voters in search of a new centre ground.</p> <p>There was also pressure on Clegg to take a tougher line on so-called middle class welfare, amid fears that further chunks will be taken out of low income welfare before the 2015 election. Don Foster, the communities minister, urged David Cameron to break his pledge not to withdraw fuel allowance from well- off pensioners. \"If we can get something like this implemented now, then that would be better.\"</p> <p>But Clegg said there will be no change in this parliament: \"On things such as winter fuel allowance, free bus passes, and free TV licences, there is of course a debate to have in the next parliament, because we've ruled it out in this coalition agreement &#xa0;\u2026 there's a question mark on whether people such as Peter Stringfellow or Alan Sugar have available to them free bus passes, subsidised by normal workers paying normal taxes and struggling to make ends meet.\"</p> <p>Sugar retorted in a tweet: \"Even if I did have a bus pass I've personally paid \u00a310sM tax, my companies 100s of millions in the past 45 years. What has Clegg done ?\"</p>",
  "<p>Deserved defeat by Aston Villa in the one English competition Roberto Mancini has yet to win merely scratched the surface of his frustrations at Manchester City. The Italian ended a fractious night claiming he has become an easy target for rival Premier League managers who cower before Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford.</p> <p>Mancini's anger stemmed from a touchline row with Paul Lambert, who joined Tony Pulis, David Moyes, Kenny Dalglish and Ferguson to have confronted the City manager. The Villa manager was incensed by what he viewed as Mancini's attempts to get Joe Bennett booked for a foul on Gareth Barry with an imaginary card. Lambert later dismissed the argument in order to focus on the finest result of his brief Villa reign. But the accused was in no mood to let the matter rest.</p> <p>\"I am tired with this manager because I didn't say anything,\" the City manager said. \"I asked the fourth official if it was a yellow card without moving my hands. He [Lambert] comes up to me every time but after this some managers go to bigger stadiums and don't say anything. I am tired of this, very tired. I am tired with their behaviour and it's better that some managers shut up because I didn't speak with this manager. I asked the fourth official if it was a yellow card and I thought the referee had left his yellow cards in the dressing room.\"</p> <p>When pressed, Mancini said he had no problem with Lambert in particular but managers in general. The point he made, eventually, was that few have the courage to confront Ferguson in identical circumstances.</p> <p>He added: \"Every time I say something, they come. After, when they go to Old Trafford, they never say anything. When other managers [at Old Trafford] talk against the referee, they always stay on the bench and say nothing. I don't know why. Maybe it's because I am Italian but I don't know the reason. There's no problem. I just don't like this type of behaviour.\"</p> <p>The root of Mancini's latest managerial spat was not the only recurring problem for City. Again they failed to preserve a lead, again they failed to keep a clean sheet and again they failed to convince. Villa took full advantage and extra-time goals from Charles N'Zogbia and the commanding Gabriel Agbonlahor gave the visitors a victory their adventure and ultimately resilient defending merited. The visitors were indebted to Shay Given for the additional period when the former City keeper tipped over Mario Balotelli's late header on a night when the Italian scored and completed a game for the first time this season. But this was no good luck story.</p> <p>City have conceded 14 goals in seven matches this season (excluding the Community Shield) and their defence was punctured twice more in extra-time when Costel Pantilimon could only parry Agbonlahor's shot and N'Zogbia pounced from close range, and again when another Agbonlahor effort deflected in off the substitute Jeremy Helan.</p> <p>\"This is the problem,\" said Mancini. \"We need to work with our defenders because they don't work well in this moment. We need to work, only this. It's the fourth competition but it's the only competition that we didn't win. For this we wanted to stay in this cup because in two years we've won everything and we're missing this cup. We are so disappointed for this.\"</p> <p>City lost Jack Rodwell to a groin injury in the warm-up but fielded a strong side that could have been trailing to a vibrant Villa display long before Balotelli opened the scoring. James Milner flicked a simple pass into the penalty area and must have been surprised himself by the freedom afforded Balotelli. The City striker had time to control, turn and beat Given convincingly before a Villa defender came close. It was his first goal since Italy's European Championship victory over Germany.</p> <p>Fortune surrounded Villa's equaliser but it had been coming. A composed one-touch move led to Karim El Ahmadi releasing Andreas Weimann down the right. His low cross was spilled by Pantilimon and the loose ball struck Gareth Barry and looped into his own net. It has been a long time since Villa supporters felt inclined to sing their former captain's name in tribute and they did not miss the opportunity to revel in his misfortune.</p> <p>Parity lasted all of five minutes before Ron Vlaar conceded a free-kick 20 yards from Villa's goal. The visiting captain was punished twice, first with a yellow card, then by a trademark set-piece delivery from Aleksandar Kolarov who whipped a left-foot shot over the wall and beyond the despairing grasp of Given.</p> <p>Back came Villa. Agbonlahor evaded two lame challenges as he ran at the heart of the City defence before comfortably beating the unconvincing Pantilimon. The Villa striker continued to dominate City's defence in extra-time and, for all the home pressure, there was no end product in sight. \"This is a massive result for us,\" said Lambert. \"It was a huge effort. It wasn't really a spat [with Mancini]. It was nothing. I am just delighted with the win.\"</p>"
