  "<p>Each time there's a mass shooting in the US and the sketchy details begin to filter into my Twitter feed, there's no longer the awful sense of horror I felt when I was new to living here, nine years ago. Now, there's just the creeping sense of inevitability; a deep sigh and a \"not again\". Columbine, Virginia Tech, Tucson, Aurora, Oak Creek: it's hard to keep up with the roll-call of American place names now synonymous with massacre.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/13/texas-gunman-police-officer-dead\">Monday afternoon, it happened in College Station</a>, a city of about 230,000, a couple of hours east of Austin, the Texas capital. So far, police have confirmed that three people have died, including an officer and the gunman, near the A&amp;M University campus, and that six other people have been taken to hospital.</p> <p>As the details of what happened become clearer, there'll be the obligatory discussion in the media, on social networks, and in bars, about whether guns are to blame. In my view, there is no debate: of course, they are. Last month, when a man killed 12 people in a mass shooting during a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises at a Colorado cinema, I posted a link on Facebook to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/20/america-needs-talk-gun-control-wake-colorado\">Gary Younge's Comment is free piece</a>, which argued that America needed to talk about gun control in the wake of the shooting. \"In the aftermath,\" I wrote above the link, \"there <em>absolutely</em> is a moral dilemma.\"</p> <p>I was surprised when one of my more liberal American friends accused me of \"jumping on the politicising-the-tragedy bandwagon\", as I don't think it's party-political at all. In fact, for me, his response reminded me how many friends of mine who vote Democrat staunchly defend the second amendment of the US constitution. It cuts across party lines. It is, after all, inspired verse from the Founding Fathers. And their word is gospel.</p> <p>The fact Monday's shooting happened in Texas came as no surprise, either. We seem to have our fair share of gun rampages. My hometown of Austin boasts the first modern-day school shooting: in 1966, Charles Whitman, a student at the University of Texas, climbed the university tower \u2013 a 27-storey structure that is an iconic landmark on the city's skyline \u2013 and picked off people at random with a shotgun. By the time Whitman was felled by a police officer's bullet, his gruesome tally had reached 15, including his wife and his mother, whom he had murdered earlier in the day. </p> <p>Ironically, what became known as the Luby's Massacre \u2013 a 1991 slaughter at a cafeteria an hour north of Austin \u2013 just agitated for the right to bear arms. Twenty-three people died after George Hennard drove his truck into a wall, climbed out and opened fire. Suzanna Hupp, a diner, had left her handgun in her car \u2013 in order to comply with the Texas law at the time \u2013 and saw her mother and father die at Hennard's hands.</p> <p>Hupp later became a Republican member of the House of Representatives and a leading campaigner for the right to carry a concealed firearm in Texas \u2013 a law she saw passed here by President George W Bush. If she had been allowed to carry one that day, she offered, she could have stopped Hennard in his tracks. In the wake of Monday's shootings, <a href=\"http://www.texastribune.org/texas-newspaper/texas-news/evening-brief-texas-headlines-aug-13-2012/\">Governor Rick Perry echoed this Texas orthodoxy</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"When it gets back to this issue of taking guns away from law abiding citizens and somehow know that's going to make our country safer, it's just I don't agree with that.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Texas has some of the most lax gun laws in the country. No state license is required to own a rifle, shotgun or handgun. There's no waiting period to buy one, no state registration of weapons. And the legal age to own a gun here? Eighteen. Texas also complies with a federal law that allows Americans to own so-called assault weapons \u2013 like the AR15 semi-automatic rifle, a lethal-looking piece of military hardware.</p> <p>Just six days after the shooting in Aurora, Colorado, my daily \"Google Offers\" email was trying to push a 10-hour concealed handgun license course on me, \"plus 20% off all personal classes\". The thinking here, presumably, is that if I got my concealed-carry licence, I'd be able to put a stop to massacres like the one in Aurora; the one at Luby's; University of Texas; or Virginia Tech.</p> <p>Back in April, seven students were killed at a small religious college in Oakland, California. That happened to coincide with a protest organised by Students for Concealed Carry calling attention to the fact that students are left helpless against people who choose to shoot up campuses. So, 80% of Americans own guns, but that's not enough. We need more guns in circulation to stop mass shootings, not less. That's how the argument goes.</p> <p>My friend Lance, a photographer working here in Austin, was a student at Texas A&amp;M University in the mid 1990s, the campus near where today's shooting happened. He grew up in Texas and owns a few guns for hunting, but he says he and his parents stopped supporting the National Rifle Association when the organisation began fighting for the right to own assault-style weapons, as well.</p> <p>\"I'm pro the second amendment up to a point,\" Lance says, \"but only for weapons meant to kill food.\"</p> <p>I push him on the issue: what about hand guns?</p> <p>\"It's an interesting one,\" he says. \"I have no interest in owning a handgun, but then you get into self-defense. And they do have some use as far as self-defense goes.\"</p> <p>According to Lance, the reality is that if the US outlawed guns (which, he points out, would never happen), it wouldn't alter the monumental number of guns already in circulation. And if there was an amnesty, it would be law-abiding citizens who would give up their guns, not criminals.</p> <p>\"Can't we start with the easy stuff?\" he says. \"Let's all agree assault weapons are ridiculous.\"</p> <p>It's a good point. Neither Democrats nor Republicans \u2013 and certainly not Libertarians \u2013 are ready to amend their precious second amendment. But surely, level-headed people would see an assault weapons ban as healthy.</p> <p>\"We need to elevate the discussion,\" Lance tells me. \"America needs to at least wake up and have real conversations about the issue. But it's hard because we're still so damn divided.\"</p> <p>Unfortunately, incidents like the one near the A&amp;M campus on Monday are just going to make that chasm even wider. And the really awful thing is, it won't be long before sketchy details of another mass-killing somewhere in the US filter into that Twitter feed again.</p>",
  "<p>Good, thank God that's over. All that warmth, goodwill, and tears, even at the bloody <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/10/jade-jones-olympic-gold-taekwondo?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">taekwondo.</a> It was getting tiring. Now we can get back to more familiar territory. Like murder. Which you don't have to wait too long for in <strong>Ruth Rendell's Thirteen Steps Down</strong> (ITV, remember?).</p> <p>I wonder how Rendell came up with the profession for Mix, her protagonist. Hmm, shall I make him an accountant, or a carpenter ... no, got it, he will be a gym-equipment repair man, specialising in cross-trainers. Anyway, it's an excellent job for him, with a touch of perviness and good access to gyms \u2013 ideal for a stalker. And Luke Treadaway is brilliant in the part, a thoroughly convincing weirdo psychotic obsessive.</p> <p>The murder \u2013 the first, I fear there may be more to come in part two \u2013 is horrid (yeah, as opposed to those really nice ones). Not a strangling, as favoured by Mix's serial-killer hero John Christie (of 10 Rillington Place); Mix suddenly and terrifyingly loses his rag and bashes new girlfriend Danila over the head with a torch until her lights are well and truly out. Rarely can a dead person have looked so utterly dead. Then under the floorboards she goes. Big mistake, Mix; schoolboy error. Never put the body under the floorboards, that's one of the first rules of murder; just you wait, it'll come back to haunt you.</p> <p>Possibly literally. Well there's something pretty creepy going on in this house, up that final dark flight of stairs. (Is that the 13 steps? I didn't quite get that.) And then, when Mix sees (a bit more) sense and decides to bury poor Danila in the garden, up there in the top window, the face that appears gothically in the lightning flashes ... [Shudders].</p> <p>Who is it? Mix's stepfather, who used to hit him? The half-sister Mix once tried to attack with a bottle of ketchup? John Christie himself? One of Christie's victims?</p> <p>We'll find out in the conclusion. There are subplots and loads of loose ends to tie up. Whatever happens, I don't think it's all suddenly going to be fine \u2013 oh, it's just another lodger up there, we forgot to tell you, meet Roger \u2026 that's not going to happen. No, there's a gnawing sense of foreboding and dread, bad shit ahead. I particularly worry for Nerissa the model, Mix's stalkee.</p> <p>Impressive then \u2013 tense, taut, and murky. With fine performances all over the place. It's nice to see Rendell's work back on the screen. And a good one for ITV to announce the fact, after two weeks in the wilderness, that they do in fact still exist.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01l3y0v\" title=\"\"><strong>The Riots: In Their Own Words</strong></a> (BBC2) was less successful. Actors speak the words of the people interviewed for this paper's \u2013 and the LSE's \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/series/reading-the-riots\" title=\"\">Reading the Riots</a> study. So many actors, so many people ... you don't really get to know anyone. And there's little sense of narrative, of how the events unravelled. So it doesn't really work as drama. Perhaps it wasn't meant to.</p> <p>What it is then is a kind of compilation, My Riot, on shuffle. And not only does it not add anything to the reports that have appeared in this paper, but nor is it nearly so comprehensive. Perhaps the sheer volume of material made it almost impossible to turn into a cohesive hour of television. But it's a bit like they smashed their way into Foot Locker, got bewildered by choice, and came out with two left shoes. One Nike, one Adidas. Different sizes. Yeah, shut up now.</p> <p>Wow! <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/escape-from-colditz/\" title=\"\"><strong>Escape from Colditz</strong></a> (Channel 4)! What an AMAZING story. In the second world war, it was considered a moral duty for captured British officers to try to escape, and they came up with the most ingenious \u2013 and insane - schemes to try to achieve it. This has to be craziest of all.</p> <p>Jack Best, Bill Goldfinch and a bunch of their chums built a glider out of floorboards, bedsheets and porridge, obviously. A system of pulleys and a falling bathtub was to catapult them from the castle roof to freedom.</p> <p>They never got to try it out, though. The war spoiled everything by ending. Jack and Bill \u2013 showing uncharacteristic prudishness \u2013 chose to walk out of the gates instead.</p> <p>Now a team has rebuilt it, albeit a remote-control version (bloody health and safety). And it works! Kinda. I wouldn't have enjoyed that landing \u2013 quite bumpy. But then I would almost certainly have just stayed in my cell, sitting the war out, amorally.</p>",
  "<p>Next Sunday, 19 August, is <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/events/humanitarianday/\">World Humanitarian Day</a>.</p> <p>You probably have not yet gotten the <a href=\"http://www.unocha.org/top-stories/all-stories/world-humanitarian-day-2012\">memo about this \"global day to celebrate humanity and the spirit of people helping people\"</a>, but quite likely you will. Or, at least, so far, more than 100 million people are on the list to get it.</p> <p>World Humanitarian Day is \u2026 well, I have no idea what it actually is. It is meant, in some way, to commemorate the work of S\u00e9rgio Vieira de Mello, the high-ranking United Nations official who was killed in Baghdad in 2003. De Mello was from Brazil and Brazil is a new world power, and getting the UN to sponsor World Humanitarian Day is a demonstration of its enhanced status. </p> <p>Every congress, or legislative body, or communal gathering the world over has various parties and interests who are always coming up with ceremonial or commemorative or self-congratulatory or plain old PR puffery occasions. The vast majority of them go unacknowledged. But some \u2013 like, say, Mother's Day \u2013 enter the popular imagination and marketing quick stream; that is, they go viral.</p> <p>At first glance, it would hardly seem that World Humanitarian Day has such potential. And yet, it has a few things going for it: a kind of inclusiveness, and lack of specificity, and general positive energy, that is hard to argue with. The standard here for promotable nebulous international altruism is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glny4jSciVI\">\"We Are the World\"</a>, which, if it did nothing else, redounded to the credit of the music industry.</p> <p>World Humanitarian Day has recruited Beyonce Knowles to be its face and she will release a video of her song \"I Was Here\", filmed in the UN general assembly, to mark the day. It is obviously good for Beyonce Knowles if World Humanitarian Day becomes Beyonce's World Humanitarian Day (rather then S\u00e9rgio Vieira de Mello's).</p> <p>Such an event ultimately derives its success from a kind of mutuality of promotional benefits. The more people (that is, celebrities) and enterprises whose aims it furthers, the more potential it has. Along with the S\u00e9rgio Vieira de Mello Foundation, Brazil, the UN, and Beyonce, World Humanitarian Day has the makers of the new technology platform, Thunderclap, promoting it. </p> <p>Thunderclap is a novel tool that could push World Humanitarian Day up there with \"We Are the World\" and Mother's Day and, to boot, make Beyonce Knowles more beloved than she already is. Likewise, World Humanitarian Day could turn Thunderclap into an incredibly important, as well as potentially really irritating, technological force.</p> <p>Thunderclap has been developed by the hottest advertising agency in the US, Droga5, and seeks to address the most burning question in marketing circles today, \"social media, what is it good for?\"</p> <p>Or, how in the hell, in the babble of social media, do you make a message stand out?</p> <p>This is not a small question. The lack of an answer has already shaved some $40bn off of Facebook's value (which could have provided a lot of humanitarian aid). </p> <p>Thunderclap's proprietary proposition is as follows: here's a platform that can be used to harbor, or horde, social media messages, in such a way that they can all be released at the exact same moment, achieving that most sought-after and elusive marketing status: impact. In other words, lots of people can get together and bundle their followers, like political dollars, and, theoretically, create a viral, or tidal wave, effect.</p> <p>Thus, next Sunday, 100 million people, representing, in addition to Beyonce's millions of followers, the followers of, among others, Chris Brown, William Shatner, Piers Morgan, and InStyle magazine will get <a href=\"https://www.thunderclap.it/whd-iwashere\">a message about it being World Humanitarian Day</a>. (Ideally, of course, there will be lot and lots of nobodies who also add their random followers to this great movement.)</p> <p>Advertising works best when everybody gets the same message at the same time, thereby creating a shared experience \u2013 the Super Bowl model, if you will. Social media's operation, on the other hand, tends to be a random and, most often, a one-to-one experience. The vaunted viral promise is unpredictable.</p> <p>This is a problem not only for the ad industry, which sells predictability, but for the purveyors of social media. They have built a system of asynchronous messaging, but now have to make money through advertising which is built on \u2026 synchronous messaging.</p> <p>Hence the real work of World Humanitarian Day and the Thunderclap platform: saving social media.</p> <p>A spontaneous version of World Humanitarian Day might be something like the viral Kony 2012 campaign, wherein a group seeking the arrest of Uganda war criminal Joseph Kony made a short film seen by over 100 million people. Advertising methodology tries to take what works organically in the culture and commodify it. Thunderclap offers the possibility of not just, in this instance, helping to encourage humanitarianism, but of bringing some consistency and order to viral marketing. </p> <p>The possibility that there might actually be such a method or a platform that could lend structure and control to a message and its distribution is what allows Mark Zuckerberg to believe that Facebook will not end up like Yahoo.</p> <p>So, if, next Sunday, you suddenly find yourself thinking humanitarian thoughts and humming Beyonce's \"I Was Here\", then social media may have been saved \u2026 if not human suffering alleviated. </p> <p>If, on the other hand, it passes unnoticed, then the cause that has been advanced here most of all is spam.</p>",
  "<p>More than a third of British medal winners in the 2012 London Olympics were from private schools, which educate 7% of the school population, a study by the Sutton Trust shows.</p> <p>The dominance of private schools is particularly evident in sports such as rowing where more than half of gold medallists were privately educated, with fewer than a third coming from state comprehensives and the rest from grammars.</p> <p>However, gold-medal winning athletes Jessica Ennis, Mo Farah and Greg Rutherford were state-educated, as were all the boxers, and all but one of the 12 medal-winning cyclists.</p> <p>Team GB won 65 medals, 29 of them gold. The proportion of state-educated gold medal winners is broadly similar to previous Games. The proportion of privately educated Olympic winners (37%) is similar to that for MPs (35%), but less than leading journalists (54%) or judges (70%), according to previous Sutton Trust studies.</p> <p>The focus on the school backgrounds of Britain's successful Olympians has prompted an inquest into the state of school sport in comprehensives.</p> <p>Prime minister David Cameron has called for a revival of competitive sport in primary schools, while the government has been criticised for selling off playing fields and cutting funds for school sports partnerships.</p> <p>Lord Moynihan, the chairman of the British Olympic Association, has said it was \"wholly unacceptable\" that half of Team GB's gold medallists in Beijing four years ago were privately educated and called for an overhaul of school sport policy to redress the balance.</p> <p>Moynihan said earlier this month that the figure was \"one of the worst statistics in British sport\" and it should be a priority to make sport a more accurate reflection of society.</p> <p>Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, said: \"While we congratulate all our Olympic winners, this research shows that independent school students are more than five times over-represented amongst our medal winners relative to their proportion in the population \u2013 which is also the case at leading universities and in the professions more generally.</p> <p>\"This comes as no surprise as children in independent schools benefit from ample time set aside for sport, excellent sporting facilities and highly qualified coaches, while in many state schools sport is not a priority, and sadly playing fields have been sold off.\"</p> <p>A new draft PE curriculum, to be published in the autumn, will make it compulsory to take part in what the government describes as \"recognised and recognisable sports\" such as football, hockey and netball. It will also prescribe \"team outdoor and adventurous activity\".</p> <p>A separate analysis by the Good Schools Guide finds that 70% of gold medallists attended a state secondary school. Both studies counted medallists in team sports individually. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/datablog/2012/aug/06/team-gb-medal-winners-background\" title=\"\">The Guardian's Datablog has also analysed medal-winners</a> by type of school.</p> <p>Labour has urged Cameron to include more than 130,000 pupils who study at free schools and academies in plans to make competitive team sports compulsory.</p> <p>Cameron announced last week proposals for primary age children and criticised schools for holding Indian dance classes instead.</p> <p>The prime minister, who is under fire for scrapping a target for pupils to do two hours of sport a week, said the new requirement would be included in the revised national curriculum.</p> <p>Shadow education secretary, Stephen Twigg, said Cameron's suggestions would only change those schools under the control of local authorities, and not academies or free schools.</p> <p>\"Sport isn't just for some schools, but for all schools. Labour wants to ensure that all pupils get access to high quality sports provision so they can do competitive sports and physical activity,\" he said.</p>",

  "<p>Looking for legacy, that's the game now. How do you bottle the butterfly moment, siphon off the spirit? Can we at least prove the Olympics made money, changed lives in east London or turned couch potatoes into runners? According to research on previous Olympics, probably not. But that misses the point. Glorious, epic, expensive, feelgood fun is how people sometimes blow their money on parties, holidays or celebrations, so why shouldn't a nation do likewise?</p> <p>But holidays end. Frenetic moods come and go, from the response to last summer's riots to Diana's death. Reversion to the norm is a mighty powerful force. Politicians trying too hard to capitalise or make political meaning out of that fleeting surge of happiness should tread warily. The Tories counted on a double bounce from the Jubilee-Olympic summer, but <a href=\"http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/6002\" title=\"\">the polls won't budge</a>. Feeling good isn't the same as feeling good about the government.</p> <p>Boris Johnson as buffoon was a one-man Mexican wave of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2187665/Going-Viral-Boris-Johnsons-dad-dancing-masterclass.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">dancing </a>dressage, but I doubt it brought him any closer to real power. Nick Clegg was booed in the hockey. David Cameron was booed in the boxing \u2013 not helped by his MP's \"leftie multicultural crap\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/28/olympics-opening-ceremony-multicultural-crap-tory-mp\" title=\"\">tweet on the opening ceremony</a>. Cameron's attempt at turning his own party's dreadful record on cutting school sports into an attack on Labour backfired badly. No sooner had he sneered at \"Indian dancing\" as a PE activity than hey presto, a flotilla of exquisite Indian dancers floated across the closing ceremony.</p> <p>Cameron did badly because this was no moment for crude political point-scoring \u2013 let alone plain untruth. He derided Labour's record, but from 1997 children doing two hours a week of sport minimum rose from 25% to 90%, over half doing much more. The national mood was for praising success, so he hit a bad note in blaming teachers for failing to supervise more sport. His insistence on traditional team games reeked of his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Paget_Flashman\" title=\"\">Flashman</a> background, badly out of touch.</p> <p>What of most children who never make a school team, humiliated by never being picked, begging their mums for \"off games\" notes? Modern PE has something for everyone: Indian dancing could become a lifelong fitness habit. Announcing a small sum extra for school sports, Cameron disguised his 69% cut that has caused a 60% reduction in school sport hours. Children's free swimming might have delivered future Rebecca Adlingtons, but Cameron axed that: 350,000 fewer swim at least once a week. \"There's a danger of thinking all you need is money and a target,\" said the PM. That's no danger, it's often a recipe for success \u2013 in the NHS, in schools and in sport. He would have done better just to applaud: the political lessons of the games all tell against him.</p> <p>Labour wisely avoided crowing too directly over Olympic golds, for fear of undermining GB athletes' sheer grit. But Britain was 36th in the medal tables in Atlanta in 1996 \u2013 and after Labour's \u00a3600m investment came fourth in Beijing, and now third. With rather more subtlety, Ed Miliband drew his own parables. \"Britain's success this week did not happen by chance\", he wrote in the Sunday Telegraph, leaving the implication but no boast. \"We have had a glimpse of the country we can be. Our duty is to do everything we can to keep that spirit alive. A country united, confident, proud and welcoming to the world. Some will say it can't be done \u2026 I know it can. That is up to all of us.\"</p> <p>The shaping of his future theme is there \u2013 look what we can do together, a collective endeavour, a public effort. He didn't say it, but for all their shameless demands, those sponsors only paid 6%, the public paid the rest. You can see the outlines of Labour's campaign: imagine what we could do to revive the desperate state of the economy. Jobs, growth, building, investing, firing up all that scientific, technical and artistic genius that brought all this together. Of course we can do better. Optimism that we have the power to shape our own economic and social destiny is Labour's to seize.</p> <p>For there is no optimism anywhere else. Cameron and Clegg face forces pulling them apart. This conference season will find angrier opponents of the coalition in both parties. Today's Guardian poll <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/12/coalition-government-brink-collapse-voters\" title=\"\">showed only 16% of people expect the coalition to hold for much longer</a>. Clegg's restive party wants revenge for the loss of both Lords reform and voting reform. Yet what should matter to them far more is the worsening state of the economy. Mervyn King has just delivered a more dire judgment than any before, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/08/bank-england-zero-growth-gdp\" title=\"\">of zero growth this year</a> \u2013 far lower than expected over the next two years. Bank lending has seized up, exports are down, the balance of payments is the worst for 15 years. Meanwhile the Trussell Trust is opening four new food banks a week.</p> <p>With David Cameron and George Osborne lashed to a failed Plan A and no sign of shifting, lashed to a failed Plan A, the one credible reason for the Lib Dems to break the coalition is to save the country from yet worse damage. Given what Clegg has led his party to vote for \u2013 benefit cuts for the poor, tax cuts for the rich \u2013 it is almost too late. But for each recession month that they stay on, tolerating all this, the Lib Dems lose credible reasons for ever making the break.</p> <p>Reshuffles make scant difference to the public: only Osborne's head on a platter would signify, but Cameron will not reverse his deficit policy. Instead it's rumoured he will bend rightwards and bring in his angry brigade to swap for Ken Clarke and George Young, his sensible tendency. He might as well try to head off the Ukip threat now he has abandoned all disguise as a detoxifying moderniser. But he will struggle to find any useful Olympic metaphors that shine a kindly light on harsh austerity.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 14 August 2012. The original referred to the Trussle Trust, rather than the Trussell Trust, opening four new food banks a week. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Sometimes as I pass the pond on my dog walkie, I see a few cormorants, sitting on a raft, elegantly holding their wings out to dry. They look rather lovely to me, so I was pretty browned off to hear that anglers are nagging for a cormorant cull, because we're only allowed to kill 3,000 a year at present, and the cormorants are still bagsying all the fish, leaving none for the anglers to kill or hook and unhook, torment and diddle about with.</p> <p>What an odd sport. An angler isn't your beautifully formed Bolt, Daley, Ennis or Farah. You wouldn't want to scream and cry with admiration at an angler. They don't raise the spirits. They just sit on their often fat bums in military or camouflage gear, next to a box of maggots and 10 tonnes of kit \u2013 trolley, bivouac, armchair, beer cans and snacks \u2013 radios on, rods stretched across the river or lakeside path, blocking it, or snooze on camp beds until their alarms awaken them to a catch, so they don't have to move unnecessarily. And now the pesky cormorants are spoiling their fun, from the River Lee to Scotland.</p> <p>It's not the poor cormorants' fault. There are hardly any fish left in the sea, because we've killed most of them, so the cormorants have had to come inland for lunch and annoyed anglers, which can carry the death penalty. But so what? We've done badgers for not really spreading TB, deer for eating crops, seals for eating more fish, hedgehogs for eating eggs, foxes, moles and voles for making a mess; the planet's stuffed anyway, and who am I to talk? I kill snails and slugs. Also let's be fair, some anglers are probably energetic, not overweight, unhook the fish lovingly, put beer cans in the bin, and are polite to passers-by.</p> <p>Some of them even greet me cheerily and admire my dog, which puts me in a bit of a fix. I have to be polite back, because I don't want a punch on the nose, and there's still some living wildlife in the background. But for how long?</p>",
  "<p><strong>My boyfriend has disobeyed my specific instructions and bought himself a Team GB jersey. Can you please tell him that wearing it when he&#xa0;does his morning jog makes him look a proper saddo keenster?</strong></p> <p><em>Kelly, London</em></p> <p>Ahhh, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly \u2026 as much as I applaud a woman who stands up for her beliefs \u2026 really? You issued \"specific instructions\" about what your boyfriend can and can't wear? Are you a real person or the Girlfriend character in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/27/interview-judd-apatow\" title=\"\">Judd Apatow</a> film, crossly trying to force your boyfriend to grow up into An Adult, whether he bleeding well likes it or not? Look, even leaving aside the rights and wrongs of a Team GB jersey, and we'll get to those in a tick, my feelings on bossing around the person with whom one shares a bed in regards to their wardrobe is that it's fine as long as they can boss you around right back. Judging from the tone of your message, I'm guessing that would most definitely not be OK with you. It's best to lay down the sartorial law only when the sartorial law is requested. Note, for example, how long I patiently waited before stating my opinion on the evils of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jun/06/double-denim-marilyn-monroe\" title=\"\">double denim</a>: I think I was doing this column for something like THREE WHOLE YEARS before finally someone wrote in, asked my opinion and I duly gave it, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/sep/21/ask-hadley-pixie-haircuts-denim\" title=\"\">again</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jun/06/double-denim-marilyn-monroe\" title=\"\">again</a> and&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jun/13/ask-hadley-men-dump-denim\" title=\"\">again</a>.</p> <p>Moreover, your objection to the Team GB kit is not on aesthetic grounds \u2013 which, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/aug/06/london-2012-olympics-best-kit\" title=\"\">to a certain extent</a>, I would understand \u2013 but that you feel it makes your paramour look like \"a saddo keenster.\" Kelly, my dear correspondent, you sound very Pre-Olympics Britain, if you don't mind me saying (and if you do, too bad \u2013 you wrote in and this is what you get). Were you asleep during the Olympics? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/07/london-2012-olympic-games-changed-britain\" title=\"\">Being keen and enthusiastic is now the new British way</a>! The closing ceremony did its damnedest to ease us back into the traditional grumbling British ways, but the truth is, two weeks of unabashed enthusiasm will take a bit more than Jessie J writhing about in a body stocking to undo. Not much more, granted, but a bit more.</p> <p>Now, under usual circumstances I&#xa0;would be very much with you about not wearing T-shirts promoting an event of which one is not specifically part. Or even, for that matter, if one is. As the brilliant US comedian Andy Samberg pointed out in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ImSbixBsOk\" title=\"\">his speech to Harvard students in May,</a> wearing a sweatshirt with Harvard splashed across it is the surest way to announce to the world that you are an \"a-hole\". Personally, I always find it a little \u2013 'ow you say? \u2013 tragic when anyone over the age of 12 feels the need to wear their favourite team's kit. Yes, you love them \u2013 that doesn't mean you have to wear them. But then, as everyone knows, wearing a Sheffield Wednesday scarf will absolutely help them move up into the Premier League.</p> <p>Yet post-Olympics, such sarkiness feels not so much misplaced but flat-out wrong. The Games were, as is universally accepted, brilliant and felt like a once in a lifetime collective experience in Britain. Therefore, it strikes me as absolutely correct to be a keenster \u2013 and there's nothing saddo about it. So there's no reason why your boyfriend shouldn't wear a jersey, if he wants to. Incidentally, the Olympics have made me re-evaluate my scepticism towards donning one's team's outfits if football teams have the same effect on fans as the Olympics had on, well, me: the person who hit the memorabilia stand when I&#xa0;went to the Games, and hit it hard. If I&#xa0;say I only stopped myself from buying a golden Wenlock because I suspected any friends who popped round would mistake it for a vibrator you will get an idea of just how hard I shopped.</p> <p>And you know, my only regret was that I didn't buy more. Because the Olympics were lovely and it's pleasing to remember them. So if wearing a little Team GB T-shirt encourages happy memories to stir in your boyfriend's breast and maybe jog that little bit further and harder in the mornings, I cannot see anything wrong with that.</p> <p>Basically, Kelly, you need to re-adjust your mind from pre-27&#xa0;July 2012 thinking to post-12 August 2012 thinking. There is nothing wrong with showing pride in one's national Olympics team now. The only wrong thing, in fact, would be to adopt a disapproving cooler-than-thou attitude. In fact, an abolition of that attitude in general would be my favourite legacy of the games.</p> <p>So give your chap a break, let him live his Mo Farah fantasies in the morning without the hassle from you. Instead, just breathe, go watch another montage of the Games on BBC1 and smile. You will feel much better.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Post your questions to Hadley Freeman, Ask Hadley, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

  "<p>A man killed six people, including his wife and their two young children, in a savage knife attack on the island of Jersey because he could not face the break-up of his marriage, his trial has heard.</p> <p>Damian Rzeszowski, a builder, struck as his wife, Izabela, was playing with the youngsters and a friend's daughter in the living room of their flat, the court heard.</p> <p>Rzeszowski, a 31-year-old Polish national, is accused of murdering Mrs Rzeszowska, their children, Kinga, five, and two-year-old Kacper. He also allegedly murdered his wife's father, Marek Garstka, her friend Marta De La Haye and De La Haye's five-year-old daughter, Julia.</p> <p>Rzeszowski, who has been held at Broadmoor hospital in Berkshire since his arrest, denies the six murders. He has pleaded guilty to manslaughter through diminished responsibility but the pleas are not accepted by the prosecution, which argues he was not suffering an \"abnormality of the mind\".</p> <p>The royal court in St Helier on Jersey was told that witnesses described Rzeszowski as a \"hard-working man\" and a \"loving father who provided for his family\". But things changed in June and July last year.</p> <p>Solicitor general Howard Sharp, for the prosecution, said Mrs Rzeszowska, 30, told her husband she had been having an affair and she threatened to kill herself. Rzeszowski started going out drinking, had a one-night stand and took an overdose.</p> <p>In an attempt to save their marriage, the couple went to Poland to visit their families. But their problems continued.</p> <p>The knife attack took place in the couple's home in St Helier on 14 August, the day of their return from Poland. Mrs Rzeszowska and her father went for a barbecue with De La Haye and her daughter, leaving the children in Rzeszowski's care. On their return they found Rzeszowski had gone out and left the children by themselves. When he reappeared at about 1pm, his wife remonstrated with him.</p> <p>Rzeszowski says he cannot remember what happened next but Sharp said the killings began at about 2.45pm.</p> <p>The prosecution believes that Garstka was the first to be attacked. He was lying on a bed when he was stabbed nine times with two knives. He did not move, suggesting he had been taken by surprise.</p> <p>Mrs Rzeszowska was supervising the children in the living room. Sharpe continued: \"Kacper was sitting on a chair at the dining table in the lounge. He was probably playing with a toy car when he was attacked.\" The boy was stabbed 13 times with two different kitchen knives. The girls, who had been painting, were stabbed 16 times each.</p> <p>Sharp said Rzeszowski, who had been drinking whisky, attacked his wife in the flat but she ran out into a courtyard. She tried to call the police but dialled a Polish emergency services number. Out on the street she was stabbed again in front of neighbours. Her friend, De La Haye, was also attacked and staggered out of the flat before collapsing.</p> <p>Neighbours tried to intervene and Rzeszowski then started stabbing himself. He fell to the ground with a collapsed lung.</p> <p>Sharp said the lapse of time between the row over leaving the children and the start of the attacks showed the spree had not been the product of a momentary loss of control.</p> <p>He said Rzeszowski had a history of violence and had been involved in up to 10 fights since moving to Jersey in 2005 and described him as a \"pressure cooker who lacks a safety valve\".</p> <p>Sharp said: \"This is the case of a man who cannot face the prospect of marriage failure and decides that if the family cannot go on as it is, it must not go on at all.\"</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>",
  "<p>A Christian publisher has pulled influential evangelical David Barton's bestseller \u2013 which aims to debunk \"myths\" about Thomas Jefferson's theological leanings \u2013 after receiving complaints of about inaccuracies. </p> <p>The conservative leader was called one of the top 25 most influential evangelicals by Time Magazine and counts Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich and Mike Huckabee among his supporters. In The Jefferson Lies: Exposing the Myths You've Always Believed About Thomas Jefferson, he argues that the third US president was a more fervent Christian than commonly believed. </p> <p>Publisher Thomas Nelson received complaints about the book even before its release and withdrew it after an <a href=\"http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/10/bartons-jefferson-lies-book-yanked/\">internal review</a> found many of Barton's claims did not have sufficient support. Initially, Barton's supporters said the criticism was ideologically based, but significant criticism from within the evangelical community has emerged.</p> <p>Evangelical critics include professor Warren Throckmorton of Grove City College, who with fellow professor Michael Coulter authored In Getting Jefferson Right: Fact Checking Claims about Our Third President, which assessed twenty key claims from Barton's book. The professors found that Barton's book omits key historical facts and presents a misleading picture of Jefferson's theological leanings. </p> <p>Barton, who is founder of WallBuilders, an organization that argues that constitutional separation of church and state is a myth, claimed Jefferson didn't question Christianity until the last 15 years of his life. </p> <p>Throckmorton said that Jefferson questioned key parts of Christianity including Mary's virgin birth, Jesus' resurrection and Jesus' teachings of being the messiah long before his death in 1826. </p> <p>\"As early as 1788, we have a letter where he said he didn't understand the trinity, and if he didn't understand the trinity, how could he possibly agree to it?\" Throckmorton told the Guardian. \"Barton has to ignore all of that, which he does. In his book, he doesn't mention it.\" </p> <p>Critics also say the book glosses over Jefferson's slave ownership. Barton argued that Jefferson couldn't free his slaves because of Virginia state law. Throckmorton says that's not true after 1782, when Virginia passed a law that let slaveowners free their slaves and Jefferson refrained from freeing his. </p> <p>Barton, who has worked as consultant to the Republican National Committee and as a co-chair in the Texas GOP, defended his claims and said he has historical documentation for each of the purported inaccuracies. </p> <p>In a statement released Friday, Barton said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As is the case with all of our published items, we go above and beyond with original source documentation so that people can be thoroughly confident when they see the truth of history for themselves. We find it regrettable that Thomas Nelson never contacted us with even one specific area of concern before curtly notifying us they had dropped the work. Had they done so, we would have been happy to provide them with the thorough and extensive historical documentation for any question or issue they raised; they never asked. The Jefferson Lies has not been pulled from publication and it will continue to sell nationally.</p> </blockquote> <p>The book is still available for purchase on the WallBuilders website, and Barton claims it has been picked up by a much larger national publisher.</p>",
  "<p>Two people, including a police officer, died when a gunman opened fire near a college campus in Texas on Monday.</p> <p>Texas A&amp;M University reported on its website that the shooter is in custody, having earlier warned students to remain inside.</p> <p>Meanwhile Rhonda Seaton of the College Station police department told CNN that several people were shot in the incident, including law enforcement officers. </p> <p>Police later confirmed that one officer and one other person had died and several more were injured.</p> <p>The extent of their injuries was not immediately known.</p> <p>An initial \"code maroon\" alert was sent out by college officials shortly before 12.30pm local time, warning students of an active shooter in an intersection close to campus.</p> <p>\"Please avoid the area.

Video footage shows <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98T0gytt04Y\" title=\"\">part of a jet bursting into flames</a>, followed by ecstatic rebel cries of \"God is great\".</p> <p>Syria's state news agency, Sana, said the jet had suffered a technical failure during a training mission and that the pilot had ejected. The rebels said they had shot the MiG down using a heavy machine gun and captured the pilot, Col Mufeed Muhammed Salman, who appears in the video.</p> <p>Ziyad al-Ameer, a local activist and resident, said warplanes had been flying over the Mohassan district and neighbouring villages for several days. Two days ago, a plane had bombed nearby Abu Lail, hitting a house and killing two brothers sleeping inside, he said.</p> <p>\"MiGs are flying here every day and shooting at random, in addition to artillery shelling. As soon as the warplanes are done, the shelling starts again. The Syrian army was using helicopters before, but now they are using MiGs,\" Ameer said via Skype.</p> <p>He said he had hidden in the bushes when two MiGs flew over his neighbourhood early on Monday morning. One of them fired on a mosque and a deserted house.</p> <p>The planes had been in the air for about an hour and a half when the Othman ben Affan battalion, part of the Ahfad Muhammad brigade, shot one of them down, Ameer said. \"The man who shot down the warplane is Muhamed Allawi. When I told him 'congratulations', he replied 'congratulations to all of us.' \"</p> <p>The FSA said the pilot had tried to return to the nearby military airport, but rebels from Bu Omer had captured him. Four more warplanes had strafed the village, killing one fighter and wounding another.</p> <p>In the video the pilot appears composed, flanked by three FSA gunmen. He claims that bruises on his chin have been caused by parachute ropes.</p> <p>Ameer said prisoners would be treated in accordance with the Geneva convention. \"None of the FSA men touched him or said any bad words to him. He refused to have any food or drink and the doctor advised us to leave him to rest.\"</p> <p>Lieutenant Abu al-Abbas al-Sabawi, a commander in the Othman Ben Affan battalion, said his unit had downed the MiG using a machine gun. Despite claims that outside parties such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia are supporting the rebels, there is little evidence that heavy weapons or surface-to-air missiles have reached them.</p> <p>Sabawi said he had defected from Brigade 15 in Homs and joined the FSA a few months ago. \"The warplanes have been shooting Muhassan district for three days,\" he said. \"We prepared an ambush for these planes by using anti-aircraft guns loaded on cars, but they changed their movements. They used to target places where they suspected FSA men were gathering, but they stopped doing that.</p> <p>\"Today we prepared another ambush among trees and bushes and we used all sorts of camouflage. As the plane was flying low we were able to shoot it down. A flame of fire came out of the plane \u2013 it seems the engine was hit. The pilot lost control and the plane started to go left and right. We guessed that the pilot was going to throw himself out of the plane so we chased him in our car until we captured him. There were explosions in plane because it was full of ammunition, but we got the pilot.\"</p> <p>Fighting continued elsewhere, with fierce battles in Aleppo and clashes and shelling in Damascus. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group, said troops had carried out a large-scale raid in the capital, arresting at least 21 people. Activists reported fighting in Salahaddine, Aleppo's most contested neighbourhood, which the government said it retook from the rebels last week.</p> <p>Diplomatic efforts have been paralysed for weeks, after 17 months of revolt. General Babacar Gaye, head of the UN supervision mission, said: \"It is clear that violence is increasing in many parts of Syria. The indiscriminate use of heavy weapons by the government and targeted attacks by the opposition in urban centres are inflicting a heavy toll on innocent civilians.\"</p> <p>He condemned Bashar al-Assad's regime for using heavy weaponsand urged it to shift from its military mindset to \"a mindset of dialogue\".</p>",
  "<p>Former prime minister Gordon Brown has invoked Britain's Olympic medal success \u2013 based, he said, on \"pooling and sharing\" of national resources and expertise \u2013 as an argument against Scottish independence.</p> <p>Speaking out at the Edinburgh international book festival, Brown said that the Union had made possible a raft of shared British institutions, including the National Health Service, the BBC and the armed forces \u2013 and had created a Britain that was much more fair and equal than it would otherwise be.</p> <p>\"One thing I take from the Olympics, a point that Sir Chris Hoy has already made for me \u2013 when we pool and share resources for the common good the benefit is far greater than would have occurred if we'd just added up the sum of the parts. So the National Health Service is common insurance policy \u2026 the BBC, shared across the United Kingdom. The armed forces, so you don't have a Scottish, a Welsh and an English army.</p> <p>\"The Olympics it is pretty clear \u2013 we managed to do it in cycling with pooled resources \u2013 if you had just divided the money and put a tenth to Scotland and a tenth to Yorkshire, you could not have achieved the same results we did.\"</p> <p>The average person in Scotland was just 4% worse off than the average person in England, he said. That contrasted with the difference between, say, Luxembourg, where the average person is six times better off than the average person in Bulgaria; or the United States, where the average person was over three times better off than the average person in Mexico. He also cited differences between Israel and Gaza, and between different parts of the US.</p> <p>The danger of breaking up what he called \"fiscal union\", was he said, that in Scotland \"you will either have to cut public expenditure enormously, beyond what is already being done, or you are going to have tax Scottish people more. Fiscal autonomy means more taxes in Scotland.\"</p> <p>If the union were broken up, he said, \"there would be regionally varied minimum wages, and a race to the bottom, with one unit trying to undercut the other. Break up and you will have different social security rates but you will end with pensioners being treated completely differently in different parts of Britain, or unemployed or disabled people. And people will think that's not progress, that's moving backwards.\"</p> <p>Indeed, he argued, success of pooling of resources between England and Scotland will forge an example for other countries seeking to grow closer in the future. \"If you look at the future, states existing side by side are going to have to find a way narrowing the differences between them. We have a model \u2026 that people will look at when they look at economic union in Africa and in Asia.\"</p> <p>An adviser to Alex Salmond, the first minister, said he thought Brown's references to the economies of the West Bank, Mexico and Delaware in the US were \"completely off the wall and bizarre.</p> <p>\"I just think that statistics about the West Bank and Israel, and statistics about Spain and Morocco, I just don't see what he's going on about,\" he said. \"I think his case is totally weird. I don't see why any of this has anything to do with the future of Scotland. Is he saying Morocco should join with Spain? Is he saying Delaware and Mississippi should be one state?\"</p> <p>Salmond, leader of the Scottish National party, plans to use the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/13/london-olympics-boost-glasgow-commonwealth\" title=\"\">Commonwealth Games, hosted by Glasgow 2014</a> and other major events \u2013 such as the Ryder Cup golf tournament at Gleneagles and a Scottish clans homecoming festival \u2013 as springboards to promote Scotland's cultural and political vitality, to build up support for independence.</p> <p>A spokesperson for finance secretary John Swinney said: \"Scotland is better off than the UK as a whole, and therefore Gordon Brown is wrong on tax and spending, and wrong about fiscal autonomy and independence.</p> <p>\"In 2010-11, Scotland contributed 9.6% of UK taxes, but we received only 9.3% of UK spending. The bottom line is that Scotland will be better off with independence and control of our own resources.\"</p> <p>Peter Wishart, MP for Perth and North Perthshire, said: \"We all know what the independence referendum will be fought over. We all know what the issues are: the economy, do we want things like Trident, having weapons of mass destruction... I don't think I have every had anyone say, in all the door-knocking I've done this summer, that 'the thing which is important to me when I vote on independence is the Olympic games in London'.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"It's really mind-boggling what you've been able to accomplish,\" said US President Barack Obama on Monday, addressing the team responsible for landing Nasa's Curiosity rover on the surface of Mars.</p> <p>A week after Curiosity landed on the Martian surface using a sophisticated rocket-and-winch system, Obama telephoned the rover's operations team to congratulate them on their \"incredible success\".</p> <p>The president said the team were, \"laying the groundwork for an even more audacious undertaking in the future, and that is a human mission to the red planet\".</p> <p>He added: \"Really what makes us best as a species is this curiosity that we have and this yearning to discover more and more, and to push the boundaries of knowledge, and you are a perfect example of that.\"</p> <p>Charles Elachi, director of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California \u2013 home of the rover team - said: \"On behalf of all of us at Nasa \u2026 hopefully we inspired some of the millions of young people who were watching this landing.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://cdn-akm.vmixcore.com/vmixcore/js?auto_play=0&amp;cc_default_off=1&amp;player_name=uvp&amp;width=460&amp;height=298&amp;player_id=1aa0b90d7d31305a75d7fa03bc403f5a&amp;t=V07O1f3OzQ7csyp3Zr3EsB4oWPjG4uFvoE\"> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://cdn-akm.vmixcore.com/vmixcore/js?auto_play=0&cc_default_off=1&player_name=uvp&width=460&height=298&player_id=1aa0b90d7d31305a75d7fa03bc403f5a&t=V07O1f3OzQ7csyp3Zr3EsB4oWPjG4uFvoE\"></script> </figure>  <p>During a more lighthearted exchange about the control room engineer who sported <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/shortcuts/2012/aug/06/mars-rover-curiosity-nasa-mohawk-guy\" title=\"\">a mohawk haircut</a> during in the landing, Obama praised the engineers' and scientists' sartorial sense. \"You guys are a lot cooler than you used to be,\" he said.</p> <p>During the past few days, Curiosity has been transmitting <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=4421\" title=\"\">a high-resolution colour panorama</a> of its landing site to Earth, while also receiving new operating software. The software upgrade will prime the plutonium-powered, 900kg vehicle to begin driving across the floor of the 155km-wide Gale Crater.</p> <p>Curiosity's cameras will next target the peak of Mount Sharp, which rises 5.5km above the floor of Gale Crater. The mountain at the centre of the crater towers over the landing site but the bulk of it was missed off the rover's pre-programmed panorama. Studying Mount Sharp's foothills is the ultimate scientific goal of the rover.</p> <p>Colour images from planetary spacecraft are traditionally derived from separate black-and-white images taken through colour filters. Curiosity takes colour images in a single step, using built-in colour filters \u2013 the same technique used in consumer digital cameras and smartphones.</p> <p>The images returned so far show a barren plain peppered by gravel and small rocks, with the distant hills that form the walls of Gale Crater partially obscured by a \"haze\" of dust suspended in Mars's thin atmosphere. Dunes are visible between the rover and the layered rocks at the base of Mount Sharp.</p> <p>The first images from the rover showed a mysterious <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=4406\" title=\"\">transient cloud</a>. Some speculation had arisen among keen amateur scientists that the cloud was the short-lived plume of dust thrown up by the intentional crashing of its rocket-powered descent stage. Following analysis of landing site images taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, mission management agreed that this kicked-up dust was the likely cause of the feature.</p> <p>The rover's suite of 10 instruments will be used during the planned two-year mission to deduce the geological history of Mars and to determine whether conditions have ever been favourable for microbial life.</p>",
  "<p>More than 5,000 people have been evacuated from La Gomera, one of the smallest Canary Islands, as forest fires that began nine days ago continue to burn out of control.

  "<p>Investors in Facebook, still reeling from the social network's disastrous stock market debut, are braced for further losses as the ban on early backers selling their shares begins to lift this week.</p> <p>In a staggered process which begins on Thursday and peaks in November, about 1.9bn shares \u2013 four times the current publicly traded number \u2013 will begin to be released from \"lockup\".</p> <p>Facebook's high-profile owners, from Microsoft and Goldman Sachs to U2 frontman Bono's venture capital fund Elevation Partners, will be free to sell the billions' worth of securities they held back from the initial public offering in May.</p> <p>\"It remains a real risk that shares will be sold on to the market and temporarily depress prices as the market could struggle to absorb an expanded float,\" said Brian Wieser of Wall Street research group Pivotal.</p> <p>Among the first out of the gate will be Accel Partners, the Silicon Valley venture capital fund which bought in when Facebook was worth just $98m (\u00a362m) and whose holding is worth $3.3bn at today's prices. Another large investor able to reduce his position from this week is Yuri Milner, the Russian tycoon behind two companies with large holdings. Milner bought in when Facebook was worth $10bn, and again when the valuation had risen to $50bn.</p> <p>Estimates suggest that half of the 268m shares eligible for sale from Thursday could be auctioned. The impact may not be felt immediately. Accel and Milner, who are believed to control the majority of these, are likely to make any disposals in a controlled way, either by staggering the sales over several days or by placing blocks at a pre-agreed price with institutions.</p> <p>The major threat to Facebook shares, whose value has fallen 40% in the three months since their debut at $38, comes in November, when 1.2bn shares, many of them belonging to employees and venture capital firms, are released from their trading moratorium. Pivotal believes that these types of investor could decide to sell up to three-quarters of their holdings.</p> <p>\"This date becomes the greatest wildcard,\" said Wieser. He believes a lot depends on Facebook's next set of financial results, expected in October, which should show an acceleration in its rate of growth that is likely to continue until Christmas and beyond as the company expands its sources of advertising revenue. \"They may be able to navigate through this. The more they can convince Wall Street of the merits of their story, the more they are likely to generate demand for the shares.\"</p> <p>Those thought likely to hold on to their investment are Facebook evangelists who already have large personal fortunes. Included in this category are Mark Pincus, founder of games group Zynga, Sean Parker, the Napster founder and former Facebook president, and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman.</p> <p>Others paid a high price before the IPO and may decide to sit tight. Goldman Sachs, which organised a pre-float investment round on behalf of private investors, many of them from Europe, bought in when Facebook was thought to be worth $50bn, well above today's $46bn market capitalisation.</p> <p>Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"If you get a lot more sellers, that is going to potentially push the price down. But at these share price levels it may well be that it is a trickle rather than a flood into the market, which wouldn't depress the share price any further.\"</p> <p>He said today's price may already be factoring in the \"overhang\" in the shares and draws a parallel with Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland, in which the British government has a large stake: would-be investors are deterred by the fact that a swath of the stock could suddenly flood the market.</p> <p>The overhang will not be eliminated until next year, when the final lockdown ends and the last 47m shares held by Milner's vehicles, including London-listed Mail.ru, are released from their restrictions.</p> <h2>Groupon punished</h2> <p>Shares in daily deal site Groupon plummeted in after-hours trading on Monday as the company announced second-quarter revenues below Wall Street expectations. The Chicago-based firm reported revenues of $568.3m for the quarter, compared with $392.6m for the same period in 2011. Analysts had expected revenues of $573m, according to Thomson Reuters. Groupon shares fell more than 15% to $6.39. The stock is down about 60% this year. The company reported a profit of $28.4m, outweighed by investor fears that the appetite for online deals is slowing.</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>The pope's butler could face up to six years in jail after a Vatican judge sent him to trial on Monday for leaking papal correspondence containing embarrassing allegations of corruption at the tiny Vatican state.</p> <p>The judge, Piero Antonio Bonnet, also sent a Vatican IT expert to trial for harbouring stolen correspondence on behalf of the butler, Paolo Gabriele, and warned that investigators would continue to track down other culprits in the so called Vatileaks scandal.</p> <p>\"Magistrates do not believe they have finished their investigations,\" said Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi. \"This is a partial conclusion.\"</p> <p>Gabriele, 46, confessed to leaking letters to an Italian journalist after he was arrested in May and held in a secure room at the Vatican. The journalist, Gianluigi Nuzzi, who published the letters in a successful book, has said he has been told 20 disgruntled Vatican staffers have released internal documents, shedding light on allegations of corrupt contracting and infighting at the Holy See.</p> <p>In his confession, Gabriele said he believed the Vatican was plagued by scandal, corruption and \"mysteries\" and needed the \"shock\" of seeing its most confidential documents published to force it \"back on track\". The butler said he believed he was an agent of the holy spirit who could help root out the \"evil and corruption\" in the church.</p> <p>After starting to leak documents, he said, \"I reached the point of no return and could not control myself any more.\"</p> <p>Investigators searching through the \"chaotic\" collection of stolen papal letters found in Gabriele's apartment at the Vatican also found gifts meant for Pope Benedict, including a cheque for \u20ac100,000 (\u00a378,00), a gold nugget and a 16th century copy of the Aeneid.</p> <p>Gabriele's lawyer, Carlo Fusco, said the cheque had ended up between the letters by mistake and that Gabriele had not sought to cash it. Gabriele told investigators he had borrowed the copy of the Aeneid to show his son's school teacher and intended to give it back.</p> <p>Experts appointed by the prosecution said Gabriele was subject to paranoia and his decision to leak the letters was driven by a \"profound need to win the attention and affection of others\". An expert appointed by Gabriele's lawyer suggested he was prey to \"restlessness, tension, rage and frustration\" and vulnerable to \"external manipulation\".</p> <p>The judge's report revealed the butler had also shared stolen documents with his \"spiritual father\", likely a priest to whom he confessed, although the report does not specify whom. Named in the report as 'B', the confessor told investigators he had burned the documents Gabriele gave him.</p> <p>Gabriele also handed a packet of documents to a friend, Claudio Sciarpelletti, the staffer now due to stand trial alongside Gabriele as an accessory after the fact. When Sciarpelletti's office at the office of the Vatican's secretary of state was searched and the documents found, he said he had never looked at them. Lombardi described Sciarpelletti's role as \"marginal\".</p> <p>Gabriele and Sciarpelletti will face trial before a panel of three judges, but not before autumn. The Vatican court, which is more accustomed to prosecuting pickpockets arrested in St Peter's Square and Vatican staffers caught shoplifting at the Holy See supermarket, shuts down for a summer break on Tuesday and will not reopen until 20 September.</p> <p>Lombardi said he did not rule out the Vatican prosecuting Nuzzi for publishing the letters.</p> <p>If convicted, Gabriele, who is married with three children, could face up to six years in an Italian jail since the Vatican does not have a prison, but Lombardi suggested the pope could pardon him after the trial.</p>",
  "<p>It sounds like something from the film Minority Report: a CCTV surveillance system that recognises people from their face or walk and analyses whether they might be about to commit a terrorist or criminal act. But Trapwire is real and, according to documents released online by WikiLeaks last week, is being used in a number of countries to try to monitor people and threats.</p> <p>Founded by former CIA agents, Trapwire uses data from a network of CCTV systems and numberplate readers to figure out the threat level in huge numbers of locations. That means security officials can \"focus on the highest priorities first, taking a proactive and collaborative approach to defence against attacks,\" say its creators.</p> <p>The documents outlining Trapwire's existence and its deployment in the US were apparently obtained in a hack of computer systems belonging to the intelligence company Stratfor at the end of last year.</p> <p>Documents from the US department of homeland security show that it paid $832,000 to deploy Trapwire in Washington DC and Seattle.</p> <p>Stratfor describes Trapwire as \"a unique, predictive software system designed to detect patterns of pre-attack surveillance and logistical planning\", and cites the Washington DC police chief mentioning it during a Senate committee hearing. It serves \"a wide range of law enforcement personnel and public and private security officials domestically and internationally\", Stratfor says.</p> <p>Some have expressed doubts that Trapwire could really forecast terrorist acts based on data from cameras, but Rik Ferguson, security consultant at Trend Micro, said the software for such systems had existed for some time.</p> <p>\"There's a lot of crossover between CCTV and facial recognition,\" he said. \"It's feasible to have a camera looking for suspicious behaviour \u2013 for example, in a computer server room it could recognise someone via facial recognition or your gait, then can identify them from the card they swipe to get in, and then know whether it's suspicious if they're meant to be a cleaner and they sit down at a computer terminal.\"</p> <p>The claims might seem overblown, but then the idea that the US could have an international monitoring system seemed absurd until the discovery of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/29/qanda.janeperrone\" title=\"\">Echelon system</a>, used by the US to eavesdrop on electronic communications internationally.</p> <p>Trapwire has not yet commented on the leak.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/jul/16/alan-davies-stand-up-comedy\" title=\"\">Alan Davies</a> is late. Late onstage, because \u2013 on the night I watch \u2013 he's lingering in his dressing room watching Mo Farah win the 5,000m. And late returning to the fringe, where he hasn't gigged in more than 10 years. But this short Edinburgh run, in advance of a national tour, finds Davies rust-free. He's&#xa0;got a decade's worth of new raw material to explore \u2013 parenthood and social media figure prominently \u2013 and still has the comedy chops to do them justice. Even so, his brand of blokey, observational standup isn't as fresh as it&#xa0;once was.</p> <p>Davies meanders around topics as he meanders the stage, ranging widely across his Essex adolescence, cottaging, and the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2166375/Second-inscription-confirming-end-date-Mayan-calendar-2012-Guatemala.html\" title=\"\">imminent Mayan armageddon</a>. It's all predicated on a larky collusion with the audience \u2013 which, happily enough, Davies establishes with ease. There are glimpses of stuff that's personal to him, including a routine about losing control of his bowels at school, which he relates to the trauma of&#xa0;his mother's death when he was six. More often, he keeps things universally recognisable, as with a riff on the differences between technology then (the 1970s) and now. Big laughs are wrung from his middle-aged struggle to&#xa0;learn Facebook etiquette. And online porn makes Davies nostalgic for his own sexual awakening: \"no one was ever trafficked against their will into the Freemans catalogue.\"</p> <p>The subjects are familiar, and machine-tooled for&#xa0;mass appeal. But&#xa0;Davies doesn't always take the positions you might expect: he heaps scorn on old-school, tough-love parenting, for example. And the detail of his observations (or recollections, in the case of the B&amp;Bs that offer either fruit juice or cereal \u2013 but never both \u2013 for breakfast) brings hoary content to new life. Shock of the new this isn't \u2013 but it's a pleasant surprise that Davies's old magic still works so well.</p>",
  "<p>Nothing. After two weeks of round the clock Olympics coverage, nothing. Unless you count the Jeremy Kyle Show or Homes Under the Hammer. As I said, nothing. Even for a person who is quite used to waking up with feelings of nothingness, the Monday morning after an Olympics closing ceremony is a bad moment. What am I going to do with myself, now there is no taekwondo to watch? You'd have thought the BBC would have at least had an Olympics reduction programme to ease the withdrawal pains. A montage of highlights or a fencing bout between an unknown Serbian and Algerian that I somehow missed first time round.</p> <p>Where is Cary Cooper? Normally at moments of intense national mourning, the Professor of Organisational Psychology is somewhere to be found in the papers offering words of comfort on how to cope with feelings of loss and abandonment. Not this time. I check his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ProfCaryCooper\" title=\"\">Twitter feed</a>. All I can find is: \"Asked by journs whether halo effect of Games will spillover into a bad econ If UK can organiz&amp;amp;perform in a world class event why not in biz\". Not sure what amping is, but even so it seems a curiously pointless question to be asking the great man. It's getting through the next few days I'm worried about, not how the economy is doing. We all know it's tanking.</p> <p>With no Cary to hand, I'm rather left to my own resources. But hopefully I'm better prepared than most as I've had to deal with countless Olympics and World Cup comedowns ever since 1972, the year I first became an armchair athlete. It's too late to offer you two of my coping mechanisms as these have to be instigated while the Games are ongoing. The first is to be prepared for the end, so it's not a surprise: during the middle weekend when John \"Fingers\" Inverdale was telling the nation that \"The games are now really beginning to hot up\", I was telling myself they were already half over. The second was to guard myself against the loss by watching two TVs at the same time on Sunday afternoon. It was surprisingly easy to watch Anthony Joshua win gold in the boxing at the same time as Manchester City beat Chelsea in the Community Shield and helped to ease the transition back to normality.</p> <p>If you've booked a summer holiday, cancel it. It may seem like a good idea to follow two weeks of intense television watching with a well-earned break, putting your feet up on a beach somewhere but, take it from me, it really isn't. From many years of experience, I've discovered that the last thing you want after the Olympics is plenty of time to do nothing. It only increases the feelings of emptiness and pointlessness. Far better to be trudging off to work, complaining loudly about how dull everything seems. I took my holidays before the Olympics. That way I was match fit for hours of television and didn't have to worry about missing the start of the football season next Saturday.</p> <p>Try to accept that the Olympics really are a two-week suspension of disbelief in which you can delude yourself that you really are interested in handball and dressage. If you're in any doubt about this, turn to Eurosport or ESPN, the spiritual home of any number of incredibly dull sports, for some aversion therapy. With no plucky Brit in with a shout of making it into the last 16, you'll wonder how on earth you spent so much time over the past fortnight, watching something you have no real interest in. Take it from me, there are a great many sports only worth watching every now and again. That's why the Olympics only comes round every four years.</p> <p>Don't fall for the smooth talking president of the International Olympic Committee, Dr Jacques Rogge, when he says that the London Olympics were the best ever. He said that to Athens and Beijing as well. He says it to every host nation. That's his job. We may have thought that London Olympics were the best ever, but the Chinese were almost certainly moaning about how their Games were better.</p> <p>And if that sounds a bit mean spirited, what are the chances in four years' time you will be saying how much better the London games were than Rio? For now, though, try to think like the Chinese. It's less painful.</p> <p>Remember that being an armchair athlete is a full-time job. The true TV Olympian never sleeps. On Monday on Sky Sports there was the all important Capital One cup first round football match between Oldham and Sheffield Wednesday. Ninety minutes of unadulterated joy. And on Tuesday there's Swindon against Brighton. It may not be Turkey v Czech Republic in the Greco-Roman wrestling but, on reflection, maybe that's not such a bad thing.</p>",
  "<p>Tracey McDermott is talking tough. As the new head of enforcement and financial crime at the Financial Services Authority (FSA), the 42-year-old is making clear that when taking on the biggest names in the City there will be no tolerance for those who play fast and loose with the rules.</p> <p>After imposing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/27/barclays-chief-bob-diamond-bonus-fine\" title=\"\">a record-breaking fine on Barclays</a> for attempting to manipulate the benchmark Libor interest rate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/17/libor-hearings-years-muddle-myopia\" title=\"\">McDermott made her debut before the Commons Treasury select committee</a> last month, where her colleague Andrew Bailey, the FSA's top banking regulator, lamented that the bank had a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/16/barclays-culture-gaming-banking-regulator\" title=\"\">\"culture of gaming \u2013 and gaming us\"</a>.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, McDermott says similar behaviour will not be tolerated in the future. She had been \"acting\" as the head of the division for more than a year until last week when she was appointed to the role full time. While not exactly adopting a \"one strike and you're out policy\", McDermott suggests that firms will no longer get two or three chances to put things right.</p> <p>\"If firms try to push things to the limit all the time, they should expect no sympathy when they fall over the edge,\" she said.</p> <p>After the Libor fine on Barclays, McDermott told a City audience: \"We need to have a low tolerance for firms that consistently bump along the bottom.\" This, she explained, was a problem that did not necessarily burst out into the open very often. \"We look at a firm and say 'you need to fix this' and they fix that problem and a new problem arises,\" she said. Firms now risk being referred to her enforcement division more quickly than in the past.</p> <p>A middle child who went to a Catholic comprehensive school in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, she has had two children during the past 10 years she has been at the regulator. \"My younger daughter has the older one wrapped around her little finger,\" she said.</p> <p>She is expected to behave more like the younger child when tackling the City, if Simon Morris of the law firm CMS Cameron McKenna is right. \"I feel sorry for the malefactors of this world ... Any firm currently cutting corners will soon have good cause to regret its sloppiness,\" Morris said on learning that her appointment had been made permanent.</p> <p>A self-confessed \"happy hacker\", McDermott now owns a horse of her own after being sent on her first riding lessons at the age of nine.</p> <p>A lawyer by profession, McDermott's training helped her prepare for her appearance before MPs in their hasty investigation into the Barclays Libor scandal, which heaped criticism on the FSA for the way it handled the interest rate-rigging saga. \"One advantage of being an enforcement lawyer and in litigation generally is you are trained to disagree with things. What I say is that I do love a debate, love a good row, a legal argument,\" she said.</p> <p>She is now reluctant to discuss Libor any further after telling MPs there are another seven financial firms, not all banks, under investigation. Nor she is keen to discuss the specifics of the accusations levelled against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/06/standard-chartered-iran-transactions\" title=\"\">Standard Chartered by a US regulator about moving $250bn (\u00a3160bn) of funds for Iranian clients</a> in breach of sanctions.</p> <p>McDermott says that new powers being handed to the regulator, which would allow the charge sheet against firms under investigation to be published, cannot be compared with the tactics used by the New York department of financial services, which gave Standard Chartered no prior warning it was going to publish allegations that the British bank had breached sanctions against Iran. If the powers \u2013 which have been criticised by the former deputy chairman of the Conservative party, Howard Flight, and others \u2013 are passed by parliament, firms would not be surprised in the same way, she argued.</p> <p>The investigation into Bank of Scotland \u2013<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/09/bank-of-scotland-fsa-serious-misconduct\" title=\"\"> a division of HBOS that has been found guilty of \"very serious misconduct\"</a> \u2013 is also continuing but she cannot talk about that either. And, on the popular question about why more bankers have not gone to jail during the five-year financial crisis, she said: \"They go to jail when they break the criminal law. It is very precise, in order to deprive them of their liability.\"</p> <p>So much of what went wrong had been about poor judgments by bankers, she said. \"I'm not sure we should want to say it should be easy to go to jail. We are committed to sending people to jail where we can. Insider dealing is the highest-profile example of that.\" Ten criminal convictions have been secured in the last 18 months and prison sentences handed out.</p> <p>McDermott moved quickly up the FSA ranks after six years with the law firm Dechert, where she was on the brink of becoming a partner. When the regulator is disbanded by the coalition next year in an attempt to beef up City regulation, her division will sit within the Financial Conduct Authority. Part of the role, as she sees it, is about restoring trust.</p> <p>\"Financial services is an incredibly important industry,\" she said. The Libor scandal closely followed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/payment-protection-insurance\" title=\"\">the payment protection mis-selling saga</a> \u2013 where the compensation bill for the big banks alone is topping \u00a38bn \u2013 and interest rate swap mis-selling to small businesses.</p> <p>\"It is clearly something that matters in the public eye. This is not to say everything in the industry is bad. The overall picture is not something which makes people want to go out to their financial advisers. Firms need to be operating for the best interests of their clients and not for their own personal gain,\" she said.</p> <p>Firms and individuals come under the scrutiny of her enforcement division when they are suspected of breaking the rules. Is this a sign that regulation has failed to prevent bad behaviour in the first place?</p> <p>McDermott notes that the FSA had overhauled its approach after the 2008 crisis. Even so, she said: \"There has to be recognition that regulators will not stop every problem. This isn't just about the regulator. It's about the culture. If the only reason people's houses weren't being burgled is because of the police we'd all get burgled a lot more.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Norwegian terror attacks which killed 77 in July last year could have been prevented or interrupted had police and the intelligence services not made a catalogue of blunders, according to an official report. </p> <p>Despite receiving a detailed description of Anders Behring Breivik 10 minutes after he let off a car bomb in the centre of Oslo, a catastrophic breakdown in police communications meant the rightwing terrorist was able to make the two-hour car journey to Ut\u00f8ya Island, passing two police cars, before boarding a boat with several assault rifles and going on to murder 69 children and young people.</p> <p>According to a 500-page report into the atrocity, the communications blunder \u2013 resulting in a note containing the description of Breivik being left on a table in the police operations room \u2013 was one of a series of failures which added to the death toll.</p> <p>Alexandra Bech Gj\u00f8rv, chairman the 22 July Commission, said a failure to mobilise helicopters, share information or accept help from private individuals prepared to drive boats to Ut\u00f8ya contributed to \"the most inconceivable brutality\".</p> <p>With better communication and individual decision making, police near Ut\u00f8ya could have got to the island by 6pm, preventing an additional 25 minutes of slaughter, she said.</p> <p>Breivik might even have been stopped seven months before the attacks, had Norway's internal intelligence service, the PST, acted on a tip from customs officials who flagged a suspicious purchase of potential bomb-making chemicals from Poland.</p> <p>By December 2010, Breivik had already bought several semi-automatic assault rifles and was, said Gj\u00f8rv, \"highly visible on websites which must be called extreme\".</p> <p>The prime minister, Jens Stoltenberg, said he deeply regretted the security and police blunders, and pledged to learn from the mistakes.</p> <p>Several of the heads of departments have already resigned, including the justice minister, Knut Storberget, and PST chief, Janne Kristiansen, but Sissel Hammer, head of the Nordre Buskerud Police District which covers Ut\u00f8ya, says she will remain while she retains the trust of her superiors.</p> <p>The current justice minister, Grete Faremo, said she would look closely at recommendations from the report before making any decisions, including calls for bans on semi-automatic weapons and improvements in shift patterns for police officers, too many of whom were just working office hours.</p> <p>Bj\u00f8rn Ivar Kruke, a crisis management specialist and associate professor at Stavanger University, who contributed to the report, said it would have been difficult to predict the shootings on Ut\u00f8ya, but the bomb in Oslo, which killed eight, had already been predicted.</p> <p>\"It shouldn't be possible to drive a car up to the main entrance and walk away with a pistol in your hand. That should be expected,\" he said.</p> <p>A training exercise from 2006 had created the scenario of a car bomb attack on government buildings but a recommendation to close the roads around the central district had been snarled up in bureaucracy for five years, said the report.</p> <p>Gj\u00f8rv said the commission had \"become fascinated\" with the way Britain concentrated much of its counter-terrorism expertise and prevention strategies in the office of the prime minister, but concluded that Norway would do better to improve leadership in its existing institutions.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 August 2012. The original said that Sissel Hammer is Oslo's police chief rather than head of the Nordre Buskerud Police District which covers Ut\u00f8ya. Bj\u00f8rn Ivar Kruke, a crisis management specialist, who contributed to the report, is an associate professor at Stavanger University, not a Professor. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Peter Sands, the chief executive of Standard Chartered, has arrived in New York as the bank attempts to negotiate a settlement with the US regulator that accused it of \"scheming\" to hide <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/06/standard-chartered-iran-transactions\" title=\"\">$250bn of transactions with Iran</a>.</p> <p>Sands does not yet know if he will personally attend a hearing with New York's department of financial services (DFS) that has been scheduled for Wednesday. The bank is meanwhile seeking to clarify whether the discussions will be held in private or public.</p> <p>The Standard Chartered CEO said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/08/standard-chartered-chief-defends-bank\" title=\"\">on a hastily convened conference call last week</a> that the 27 pages of accusations published by the DFS, led by Benjamin Lawsky, contained a number of \"factual inaccuracies\". The DFS claimed Standard Chartered broke sanctions with Iran by moving 60,000 payments worth $250bn around the financial system but Sands argues the scale of the sanctions breach is much smaller \u2013 just under 300 payments worth $14m.</p> <p>A rule breach of that size would indicate a fine of around $5m on the basis of the scale used by the US government's office of foreign assets control which is also investigating. Analysts expect the fine to be larger, however. \"Our working assumption is that it will be coerced into paying a settlement running to several hundred million dollars,\" said Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec.</p> <p>Sands and his colleagues were caught on the back foot by the DFS when it announced a week ago that it believed Standard Chartered had broken US sanctions with regard to trading with Iran.</p> <p>The 27 pages released by Lawsky's office contained emails between Standard Chartered officials and an exchange in which the head of risk was said to have replied to a colleague warning him of the perils of breaking sanctions: \"You fucking Americans. Who are you to tell us, the rest of the world, that we're not going to deal with Iranians?\"</p> <p>The current finance director, Richard Meddings, was head of the risk at the time \u2013 October 2006 \u2013 although the bank insists that the remarks are not representative of what was said.</p> <p>Shares in the bank stabilised on Monday, ending little changed at 1333p after a rollercoaster ride since the DFS made the allegations. At one point last Tuesday the shares were down almost 25% because of fears the bank could lose its licence in New York and its management team would need to quit.</p> <p>Ideally, Standard Chartered would aim to settle with all the regulators in the US \u2013 which also include the department of justice \u2013 at once, although it is not clear if this is possible before Wednesday when the DFS has set the hearing.</p> <p>Although Standard Chartered had been noting in its annual reports since 2010 that it was in \"discussions\" with regulators over historic breaches of sanctions, it had been thought a settlement was still some way off until the DFS levelled its accusations in public.</p>",
  "<p>A potential new source of finance for universities opened up recently, when <a href=\"http://www.4-traders.com/news/Allen-Overy-LLP-De-Montfort-University-taps-the-debt-capital-markets-for-funding--14422164/\" title=\"\">De Montfort University issued \u00a3110m of bonds to finance an upgrade of its facilities</a>. Whereas bond issues by US universities are common, particularly among the Ivy League, they are rare in the UK. That may be however about to change.</p> <p>With important changes to university funding, banks unwilling to lend long-term at fixed rates, and interest rates in the bond markets currently very low, the bond markets are an attractive financing option for universities.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hefce.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">HEFCE</a> (the Higher Education Funding Council for England), responsible for distributing public funds to universities has currently allocated funds using a formula to determine how much each university requires. Universities can then decide how to apply this funding, subject to complying with certain criteria. From September 2012, however, HEFCE grants will be reduced, and universities' publicly funded income will depend much more on tuition fees from students. A significant proportion of public funding will go to students through loans from the Student Loan Company (rather than to the universities through grants). How much public funding each university will ultimately receive will therefore depend on the number of students choosing to study there.</p> <p>In response, as we have seen, universities - now able to charge higher tuition fees - are choosing often to charge the top tier of \u00a39,000 per year for UK/EU students. But these higher costs are likely to make students more choosy about where they apply, increasing yet further the competitive pressure on universities. This in turn means that some universities will want to invest in building or refurbishment programmes or fund new teaching posts, in order to enhance their attractiveness to potential students. With less grants available from HEFCE, borrowing may be the best option to finance these student attraction strategies.</p> <p>The university that turns to the financial market will generally want the loan to have a long maturity period (i.e. to spread out the accounting cost as much as possible) and a fixed interest rate (to give certainty of cashflow). Until the financial crisis, the obvious source was a bank. But with tighter capital requirements now applicable, banks are unwilling to lend for long periods at fixed interest rates. Even if they do lend long term, they want the interest rate reset every five years \u2013 which obviously exposes the borrower to uncertainty about future funding costs.</p> <p>The other main alternative for entities wanting to borrow large amounts is to issue bonds in the capital markets.</p> <p>Bonds are merely certificates of indebtedness. They are issued predominantly by governments, banks and corporate businesses. Each bond represents an obligation of the issuer to pay the holder the principal amount of that bond on its maturity date (30 June 2042 in De Montfort's case) and, in the meantime, periodic interest payments. In De Montfort example, the interest rate is 5.375% per annum, payable semi-annually.</p> <p>The 'capital markets' are not physical marketplaces, but rather a network of international relationships whereby vast amounts of capital are available from financial institutions, pension funds and investment funds. Despite the financial crisis, the UK capital markets (for sterling bonds by UK issuers for UK institutional investors) have remained remarkably resilient.</p> <p>Bonds issued in the capital markets can be easily traded, which makes them attractive to investors. For borrowers, issuing bonds has both advantages and disadvantages compared to a bank loan. Since the potential number of investors is far greater than banks offering loans, the amount of funds available to a bond issuer is potentially much bigger. Against that, a bond issue typically takes longer to arrange than a bank loan and, if the issuer wants to amend the terms of the bonds during their life, tracking down the bondholders can be problematic. However, the issuer is usually subject to fewer obligations than under a bank loan \u2013 and currently the huge advantage for issuers is that, unlike bank lenders, capital markets investors are prepared to lend (to stable business models) for 20 to 30 year maturities at fixed rates.</p> <p>The trend for public sector issuers to tap the capital markets is not new. <a href=\"http://www.bdo.uk.com/library/plugging-affordable-housing-funding-gap\" title=\"\">In the social housing sector, bond issuance has increased</a> significantly since the start of the financial crisis (32 issues since mid-2008, compared with an average of one or two a year previously). The reasons are very similar to those applicable to universities \u2013 a need for capital expenditure (to fund new social housing), a squeeze on government money, banks unwilling to lend long-term at fixed rates, and interest rates in the bond markets very low.</p> <p>Local authorities have also been looking at the capital markets. In July 2011, for example, the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/8613090/Crossrail-financed-by-600m-bond.html\" title=\"\">GLA borrowed \u00a3600m</a> through an issue of bonds, to help fund Crossrail.</p> <p>The experience in the social housing sector has demonstrated that the capital markets provide an attractive way to fill the funding gap for public sector entities. Universities are well placed to follow suit.</p> <p><em>Geoff Fuller is a partner in </em><a href=\"http://www.allenovery.com/pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>Allen &amp; Overy</em></a><em>'s international capital markets department, and is the author of The Law and Practice of International Capital Markets</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<h2><strong>Francis Ford Coppola (director)</strong><br></h2> <p>I shot <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2009/jan/02/mickey-rourke-rumble-fish\" title=\"\">Rumble Fish</a> back-to-back with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/76277/outsiders\" title=\"\">The Outsiders</a>, in the same location. Both were set in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and based on novels by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJnfleLeOZg\" title=\"\">SE Hinton</a> \u2013 who has a small part in Rumble Fish as a hooker who approaches Rusty James, the hero, while he's out walking with his brother. Hinton's book appealed to me because of the focus on brotherly relationships. August, my older brother, was a major influence on me, and I was intrigued by the adoration Rusty (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000369/\" title=\"\">Matt Dillon</a>) has for his own older brother, the Motorcycle Boy (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/mickey-rourke\" title=\"\">Mickey Rourke</a>).</p> <p>There were some great performances, especially from Matt, Mickey and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/dennis-hopper\" title=\"\">Dennis Hopper</a>. I prepped Mickey by giving him a copy of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2006/apr/12/books.comment\" title=\"\">Albert Camus's The Outsider</a>. He had a reputation for volatility, but he's actually very sweet, so odd and interesting, ideal as the mysterious Motorcycle Boy.</p> <p>The film has a real feeling of heat. I can't remember what the actual weather was like, but we made a conscious effort to make it appear hot, spraying the actors and wetting their underarms.</p> <p>I decided to shoot in black and white because I wanted to make an art film for young people, and black and white gives a quality of poetic realism. I didn't just leave it to the script to tell the story \u2013 I also used camera angles, lighting and soundtrack to stimulate a young audience into loving the form as much as I did. I was disappointed when they didn't rush to see it. But it's pleasing its appeal has endured. It was the film I&#xa0;really wanted to make.</p> <p>I like its strong visual motifs, such as the sequences with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09SzubNNEdA&amp;list=UUTMoFozMX_0KlRmRxoFXtrg&amp;index=9&amp;feature=plcp\" \">the sped-up cloud movement</a>. I've always been fascinated by the unreliability of time, shown by the sweeping shadows as the sun and moon make their way across our sky.</p> <p>Cinematographer <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005664/\" title=\"\">Stephen Burum</a> is a master craftsman. His camera work created this unreal, dreamy mood some people thought reflective of German expressionism. Others spotted the influence of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/orsonwelles\" title=\"\">Orson Welles</a>. Of course, you're influenced by so many films, even if you're not thinking of them when you shoot. They just sort of sneak in.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/09SzubNNEdA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/09SzubNNEdA?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09SzubNNEdA&amp;list=UUTMoFozMX_0KlRmRxoFXtrg&amp;index=9&amp;feature=plcp\">Reading this on mobile?

A lot of it was about sounds rather than music \u2013 the clack-clack of billiard balls, the blaring of horns, the tick-tock of clocks \u2013 but all with the rhythmic quality Francis wanted. That recurring theme of clocks ticking was almost the only time, in all the films I've worked on, that a collaboration happened as planned. Most directors talk high-concept, but it's out of the window by&#xa0;the first test screening.</p> <p>Pretty much all the music came from guitars, bass and drums laid down by me in my studio. That was the one culture clash between my rock background and the world of film. They kept asking: \"When's the scoring date?\" Normally, that's when the director and producers hear what you've written recorded by a full orchestra. It's a very tense occasion, and expensive if you get it wrong.</p> <p>I knew none of this. I'd been doing the music as I went along, like a painter pulling colours off a palette. So my \"scoring date\" consisted of me in my studio playing what I'd recorded to these flinty-eyed professionals. They were dumbfounded \u2013 but overjoyed.</p> <p>\u2022 Rumble Fish is released on Blu-ray 27 August.</p>",
  "<p>If you were to lock a group of pop culture junkies and TV addicts in a bunker, tell them that the end of the world had arrived and that they had to preserve culture for posterity by writing books, what they would produce would be fan fiction (fanfic). This is actually the plot of a piece of fanfic from the 1950s, in which sci-fi fans survive Armageddon and rebuild civilisation in their own image. It may seem like a joke, but for many the rise of fanfic is \"the end of the world\". Fanfic is seen as the lowest point we've reached in the history of culture \u2013 it's crass, sycophantic, celebrity-obsessed, naive, badly written, derivative, consumerist, unoriginal \u2013 anti-original. From this perspective it's a disaster when a work of fanfic becomes the world's number one bestseller and kickstarts a global trend.</p> <p>As we all know, Fifty Shades of Grey, originated as a piece of fanfic based on the Twilight series. <a href=\"http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/lifeandtimes/fifty-shades-erotic-romance-now-a-global-hit/536171\" title=\"\">Since it hit 31 million sales in 37 countries</a> worried voices are asking: is this the beginning of an era in which fanfic overthrows original creation?</p> <p>It's tempting to get caught up in paradigm-shift apocalypticism, but a closer inspection reveals that fanfic is not new at all. There have been phases, fads, peaks and controversies throughout its history and it displays an incredibly diverse range of sub-genres. There's crossover, AU, Hentai, OoC, Uber, Mary Sue, slash fic, hate fic, anti fic and even wing fic (in which familiar characters sprout wings and discover their new beauty through acts of mid-air coitus). So where did this terrifying range of forms begin? And is Fifty Shades really a threat to culture?</p> <p>It's time to learn some of the jargon that fans use to describe their fic.</p> <h2>Folklore fanfic</h2> <p>If one sees fanfic as \"the work of amateurs retelling existing stories\", then one would have to conclude that the number one book in the middle ages \u2013 the Bible \u2013 was a work of fanfic, as Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were non-professionals retelling the same story about the same character. However, such a definition of fanfic is skewed historically. There were no fans in the middle ages, and there were also no authors.</p> <p>If we see fanfic as \"the reworking of another author's characters\" then this form really only appears for the first time in history with the invention of legal authorship in the 18th century through copyright and intellectual property laws, after the invention of the printing press. After all, you can't have derivative works or copies if there are no regulations over what constitutes original works, or separates ownership from theft. Predating this change, with the exception of educated men of letters and Christian scholars, the populace experienced stories only through the aural folklore tradition. Such tales were re-tellings and re-makings of the same stories over generations \u2013 this was a manuscript culture in which texts were open to intervention and were not fixed. Nobody owned them and they were based on stock characters \u2013 The rake, the temptress, the Stephron and the Phyllis (Shepherd &amp; Shepherdess), the priest, the devil, the good Samaritan. In England The Romance of the Rose was the paradigmatic example of the medieval form: one writer would begin the story and another would complete it. Even Shakespeare, did not own the stories in his plays. A patron would commission him to retell a story and he was paid in royalties. All stories within the medieval period were re-workings of stories about the same characters, but we could not call them fanfic as copyright law and the printing press had not yet sectioned off the professional, paid, copyright owner of original texts, from the rest of the populace, creating a subclass of fans.</p> <h2>Fifty shades of Austen</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394685208\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2012/8/13/1344873666355/Old-Friends-and-New-Fanci-008.jpg\" alt=\"Old Friends and New Fancies\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Old Friends and New Fancies \u2013\u00a0an Imaginary Sequel to the Novels of Jane Austen by Sybil Brinton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No sooner had the novel emerged in the 18th century than popular authors such as Daniel Defoe started protesting that his work was being \"kidnapped\" and bowdlerised by amateur writers who reduced the value of his creations with inferior impersonations. Jane Austen was less concerned with such matters, basing characters like Wickham in Pride and Prejudice upon \"The Rake\" from the lore tradition. In the 20th century with developments in cheap printing techniques and distribution, Austen inspired fanzines. A cult of dedicated literary fans called themselves the Janeites and the novel Old Friends and New Fancies \u2013 an Imaginary Sequel to the Novels of Jane Austen by Sybil Brinton, published in 1913 was the first published work of Austen fan fiction. This is an example of continuation fic \u2013 the creation of storylines that use the same characters but elaborate on unresolved threads within the originals to create new episodes. A century later the Jane Austen Fanfiction Index now catalogues over two hundred thousand works of Austen fanfic, while Goodreads currently lists 242 published books of fanfic derived from Austen. Titles include Vanity and Vexation and Dating Mr Darcy. A great number of Austen fanfic stories are pornographic.</p> <h2>The strange case of Sherlock &amp; Mary Sue</h2> <p>In the 1920s, fans of Conan Doyle started Sherlock Holmes societies in London and New York, at which they debated issues such as the question of whether Holmes's addiction to cocaine was beneficial to his perception or a sign of moral weakness. They also produced the Baker Street Journal, a hybrid zine, halfway between scholarly research and pure fandom and at gatherings read their own versions of stories they'd written themselves. The most notable works are examples of self-insert fic \u2013 in which the writer meets their hero. Examples include: My First Meeting with Sherlock Holmes by Ellery Queen and Sherlock Holmes in the White House by Roosevelt. Roosevelt in this case was not the then President, so this was also real person fic \u2013 in which a fan writes about politicians, sports celebrities, musicians, film stars etc, as if they are known to them \u2013 with self-insert.</p> <p>When the self-insert character is the author thinly disguised this is called Mary Sue fic. Mary Sues are usually flawless characters who outshine the famous characters they are placed beside. In 1973, one Paula Smith wrote an infamous fanzine short story: A Trekkies Tale in which the Starship Enterprise was visited by someone called Paula \u2013 a stunning woman who all the crew fell for. By the late 1980s there had been a glut of Mary Sues fictionally beaming themselves up on to the Starship Enterprise, and true fans started to view the sub-genre plots as insidious. Interestingly, by outshining the heroes Mary Sues reveal a lurking contempt on behalf of their fan writers towards the original characters.</p> <h2>The Enchanted Duplicator</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394685209\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/13/1344874184719/Enchanted-fan-books-008.jpg\" alt=\"Enchanted fan books\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Original cover for The Enchanted Duplicator</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From the 1930s to 50s fanfic existed almost exclusively within the sci-fi communities, in clubs such as the Futurians (1937\u20131945). A fascinating bunch, obsessed with communism and latterly fascism). Many fans from such groups, such as, Isaac Asimov, went on to become published authors, blurring the distinction between amateur fan and professional writer. In 1952, the world's first book of fanfic about fans appeared. The Enchanted Duplicator by Walt Willis and Bob Shaw was a metafiction based on Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, but which described a world populated with sci-fi fans. It chronicles the adventures of hero Jophan in \"the land of Mundane\". All of the characters in the book are renamed versions of real fans from the London SF circle of the 50s and the book was created entirely for their pleasure. The Enchanted Duplicator of the title is a mimeograph \u2013 a precursor to the photocopier and the chosen distribution medium of the fan. <a href=\"http://www.ansible.co.uk/misc/ted18.html\" title=\"\">The book concludes with Jophan's discovery of \"The Magic Mimeograph\"</a> which \"\u2026 will produce the Perfect Fanzine \u2026 and now the song of the trumpets filled the air, ringing across Trufandom to the far mountains\". This is fanfic squared and a way of life called \"fandom\".</p> <h2>Slash and K/S</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394685210\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2012/8/13/1344867484684/Desert-Heat---Spock-and-K-008.jpg\" alt=\"Desert Heat \u2013 Spock and Kirk by Gayle Feyrer\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Desert Heat \u2013 Spock and Kirk by Gayle Feyrer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the growth of television in the 50s fanfic spread globally. Sci-fi fanfic then morphed and its subtexts became dominant. Slash fic is sub-genre in which buddies from classic TV become gay lovers. The first slash fic novel to be published was <a href=\"http://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Ring_of_Soshern\" title=\"\">The Ring of Soshern,</a> a 105-pager by Jennifer Guttridge (1968). In it Spock and Kirk find themselves stranded on a remote, deserted planet. Spock goes into the state of \"Pon Far\": the violent \"on heat\" fever that comes to Vulcans, during which they must \"have sex or die\". To save Spock's life Kirk allows Spock to penetrate him, the two then fall in love and \"spend all their remaining days on the planet exploiting both the planet and each other's bodies\".</p> <p>The violent-sounding \"slash\" is so called because of the \"/\" separating the names of the two characters involved in homoerotic love or pornographic sex, for example Holmes/Watson, Spock/McCoy, Harry Potter/Ron, Starsky/Hutch, Jesus/Judas. Over the decades slash has also come to stand for porn of any kind, including \"Het\". Other subgenres in slash include femslash in which formerly het characters have lesbian experiences (Buffy is popular). HP femslash is Harry Potter lesbian porn; real person slash is where the writer makes love to a famous person; and, disturbingly, Chanslash is a Japanese sub-genre which involves coitus with famous characters who are underage. These two merge in <a href=\"http://www.justinbieberfanfiction.com/browse.php?type=epubbrowse\" title=\"\">Justin Bieber fanfic</a>. On one site alone there are 16,040 stories available as ebooks by 8,028 authors, which feature the child star at different ages and to degrees of eroticism. The story 1st by Cassie Chassey is a Self-insert Mary Sue Het Slash romance which includes \"emotional abuse, sexual abuse and sexual assault\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394685211\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/13/1344874627441/Justin-Bieber-fan-books-008.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Bieber fan books\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">1st by Cassie Chassey</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a dark sexual undercurrent to the majority of fanfic, as if on a subconscious level the fan actually resents the control that their idol or idealised character has over their life. Through the act of writing fanfic, and subjecting characters to compulsive or vengeful love, sex, S&amp;M or rape, the fan then regains control.</p> <h2>James Potter and the prisoner of copyright</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394685212\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2012/8/13/1344867675425/James-Potter-and-the-Hall-008.jpg\" alt=\"James Potter and the Hall of Elders' Crossing\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Potter and the Hall of Elders' Crossing by G Norman Lippert</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While fanfic multiplied exponentially with the invention of the internet, authors were split over what to do about it. Anne Rice, author of Interview with the Vampire vigorously defended her copyright, claiming that fanfic, in particular AU fic diluted the integrity of her characters and stories. In a letter to her fans she stated: \"I do not allow fan fiction. The characters are copyrighted. It upsets me terribly to even think about fan fiction with my characters. It is absolutely essential that you respect my wishes.\" Fanfic authors then claimed that Rice had attacked them by email and even threatened their businesses. She also demanded that FanFic.net remove all fanfic stories. Since then authors such as Andre Norton, Mercedes Lackey and David Weber have also come to adopt a zero-tolerance stance.</p> <p>Contrary to this Douglas Adams claimed that fanfic expanded his understanding of the parallel universes he'd created in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and that they increased his sales. JK Rowling also encourages fanfic. In 2003 she said she was \"flattered people wanted to write their own stories\" based on her characters. She did however stipulate one condition \u2013 that they did not try to make money from their creations. Her stance was tested when fan/author George Lippert decided to commercially release a book of Continuation fic which was Extending the Canon. <a href=\"http://wordsutteredinhaste.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/james-potter-and-hall-of-elders.html\" title=\"\">James Potter and the Hall of Elders' Crossing</a> was based on a fictional son of Harry. Rowling threatened legal action for infringement, but after much adverse press from fans she relented and allowed the publication to go ahead.</p> <p>Fans now use disclaimers such as: \"JK Rowling owns all recognisable characters/settings/spells/etc in this fanfiction.\" And Rowling permits all fanfic under the proviso that it does not contain racism or pornography. This an entirely futile request as <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3666577/How-J-K-created-a-monster.html\" title=\"\">slash HP (Harry Potter) has become one of the internet's most popular fanfic forms</a>. In it Rowling's characters are made to have sex with each other in almost infinite variations: Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione, Snape/Narcissa. Arthur/Molly, Molly/Hermione, Hermione/Fred&amp;George, Draco/Pansy. These have also been \"crossed-over\" with characters from other films and books, some of which are paedophilic in nature. Such quantities of posts are nearly impossible to track and monitor. Fan fiction.net has 603,410 HP fic stories.</p> <p>Rowling's launch of Pottermore online is set only to increase fan participation and produce even greater quantities of fanfic, including slash. There is even <a href=\"http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7237056/1/Pottermore\" title=\"\">fanfic about Pottermore</a>.</p> <h2>Crossing over and mashing up</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394685213\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2012/8/13/1344873149392/Darth-Vader-v-Harry-Potte-008.jpg\" alt=\"Darth Vader v Harry Potter Spongebob VS Edward & Harry Potter Spongebob VS Edward & Harry Potter\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darth Vader & Spongebob VS Edward & Harry Potter</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most postmodern and aesthetically bankrupt of all fanfic, is when two well-known franchises from the same genre are \"crossed over\". So you get BattleStar Gallactica, crossed with Star Trek, which results in the story: <a href=\"http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8316852/1/Star_Trek_Way_of_the_Battlestar\" title=\"\">Star Trek: Way of the Battlestar</a> \u2013 author Carson Napier.</p> <p>One of the problems with this sub-genre is that narratives and character motivations have to be warped to fit convoluted, meaningless mergings. This is taken to absurd lengths with YouTube \"films\" like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXnPG19npW8\" title=\"\">Battlestar Galactica Vs Star Wars Vs Star Trek Vs Babylon 5</a>. Crossover has now become mainstream through such projects as Aliens Vs Predator which exists as cartoons, computer games, movies, a TV series and a series of novels. Crossover also jumps genres so Edward from Twilight ends up in Hogwarts, Bella ends up in ER and the characters of The X-Files clash with those of Breaking Dawn.</p> <p>While much credit has been given to mashup author Seth Grahame-Smith for \"unleashing a whole new genre\", with mashup, the truth is that the mashup technique behind Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, was developed decades before within fanfic. The aesthetic innovation that elevates mashup fic above Crossover fic is the deliberate clash of incompatible genres in a way which is deconstructive or at least humorous, as in Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter.</p> <p>Much mashup fanfic however simply creates an incomprehensible mess. See <a href=\"http://m.fanfiction.net/s/7398721/2/\" title=\"\">A Very Potter Sitcom, season 2!</a> In which Dumbledore appears in Legally Blonde the Musical and the <a href=\"http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6880805/1/Triwizard_Mash_Up\" title=\"\">Triwizard mashup</a> in which fans vote for fight stories to be written between characters such as Godzilla, Gandalf, Darth Vader and Spongebob Squarepants. This also results in meaningless second gen multiples like Darth Vader &amp; Spongebob VS Edward &amp; Harry Potter. Fanfic sites also post narratives of impossible meetings (usually sexual) between improbable characters \u2013 Captain Jean-Luc Picard has sex with Elrond from Lord of the Rings. Indiana Jones has sex with Voldemort \u2013 this is mashup slash. As no new plot or characters are being created, then all that can happen is the multiplication of crossover interactions and partners, and an attendant increase in sexual imagery and violence. There are literally millions of fanfic stories in which sex and humiliation (fuelled no doubt by fan boredom) are the only possible outcome of such contrived and meaningless confrontations.</p> <h2>Alternative Twilight universes</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394685214\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2012/8/13/1344867365887/Master-of-the-Universe-by-006.jpg\" alt=\"Master of the Universe by Snowqueens Icedragon\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Master of the Universe by Snowqueens Icedragon</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the 90s AU has dominated. AU fic (alternative universe) features stories which are based on \"what-ifs\", which deviate from the original novels or films. So there's \"What if Darcy was blind\" or \"What if (in Twilight) Bella is engaged, to Jasper, not Edward\". The stories must deviate from the canon but still remain familiar. There are currently <a href=\"http://twific.net/?p=5463\" title=\"\">over a hundred self-published Twilight AU novels</a>, while <a href=\"http://www.fanfiction.net/book/Twilight/\" title=\"\">fanfiction.net has 130,137 predominantly AU narratives</a> which include: Edward and Bella meeting in kindergarten; Edward as a teacher, Bella as a student (with motorbike action); Jacob and Edward as gay lovers; Bella and Alice in love; Edward is an Angel; Bella is the vampire and Edward is the human; Bella is a millionaire and Edward is a professional thief; Edward is a tattoo artist; Bella is on the Titanic; Bella is going to commit suicide when sexy teacher Cullen saves the day; Bella owns a Pizza place called Pizza and Porn; Edward and Bella set in the 1800s (a rape fantasy). On this site 66,606 of the stories are rated M, for 18+. <a href=\"http://www.themarysue.com/50-shades-of-grey-and-the-twilight-pro-fic-phenomenon\" title=\"\">As one leading fanfic site claims, \"the majority of Twilight fanfic is porn\"</a>. Many of these stories will sound spookily familiar. In one: His Personal Assistant (2009), \"Bella Swan, personal assistant to handsome, rich, successful Edward Cullen, decides to make oblivious boss fall in love with her\"; in another (2009) \"Edward is a millionaire obsessed with Isobella Swan\". One, <a href=\"http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4764216/1/The_Submissive\" title=\"\">The Submissive by Tara Me Sue</a>, is described as \"37 chapters of juicy graphic detail\", \"Think Story of O meets Twilight minus the vampire stuff\". This story, which can be found on fanfiction.net, like the others above, predates the publication of Fifty Shades by two years and was not written by EL James.</p> <h2>50,000 shades of lore</h2> <p>Fifty Shades series grew out of a multi-part series of Twilight fanfic called Master of the Universe. It placed the Bella and Edward love affair in an alternative universe, in contemporary Seattle and changed their names: Bella = Anastasia, Edward = Christian Grey.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thepassivevoice.com/05/2012/fifty-shades-a-copy-of-twilight-or-not/\" title=\"\">Although the author then tried to erase evidence of its fanfic origins</a>, it's clear that rather than being some lightning bolt new genre called \"Mommy porn\", Fifty Shades is actually a very generic work of Twilight fanfic from amongst tens of thousands already created. It is, in fact, a piece of \"AU het slash Twilight fic\", and as we've seen, in all slash fic, sex and sexual violence are the predictable components of the genre.</p> <p>We should not consider EL James an author in the conventional sense for the same reasons that we wouldn't call someone from before the invention of copyright an author. Rather, her books are like medieval lore \u2013 in a sense she doesn't own the content. This content was circulating in 60,000 variations among the fanfic of other Twilight fans for years before she even created the books. Like a gambling machine with a limited number of options for recombination, the story was going to eventually be spat out as a win for somebody. This isn't an example of plagiarism but a return to an earlier notion of collective creation. Fifty Shades is a book with 60,000 authors.</p> <p>The only innovation is not in the story itself but in the delivery system that launched it \u2013 Amazon KDP. Without Kindle the book(s) would never have escaped the gravitational pull of fanfic sites and would not have been able to earn their author any money. KDP, has become the Enchanted Duplicator that has monetised fanfic and propelled it into the market. The historic difference, the point we have just crossed, is that now, through the mechanism of epub, fanfic is heading towards becoming the cultural dominant. The much-hyped \"next Fifty Shades\", <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10140661-gabriel-s-inferno\" title=\"\">Gabriel's Inferno</a>, also started life as Twilight fanfic, and the fact that Penguin hunted it down from fanfic sites and paid a \"seven-figure\" sum, marks the transition where the market turns upside down, and mainstream content is created by fans.</p> <p>Beyond that, as we have seen with other fanfic, Fifty Shades has launched a spate of impersonations, pastiches, parodies, homages and rip-offs. Like the Enchanted Duplicator, this is fanfic based on fanfic. Currently on Amazon there are 641 quickly made ebooks tagged under \"Fifty Shades\". They fall into the hate fic, insert fic, crossover fic and continuation fic categories and include: Fifty Shades of Earl Grey, Fifty Shades of Garbage, Fifty Shades of Bacon Flavoured Vagina Spray, Fifty Shades of Grey and Zombies, Fifty Shades of Pink, of Green, of Gay, of Alice in Wonderland, of Twilight. Finally with Fifty Shades being developed by Universal Pictures the phenomenon comes full circle. If any of the stars of Twilight the Movie appear in <a href=\"http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/11794851-popular-twilight-fan-fiction-fifty-shades-of-grey-becoming-a-movie\" title=\"\">Fifty Shades the Movie</a>, then the serpent will have devoured its tail.</p> <p>So what happens to culture when fanfic becomes the dominant economic model in publishing and the leader in cultural values \u2013 is that even possible? Surely derivative works have to be derived from something \"original\". With Fifty Shades this ceases to be the case, and, as we have seen, fanfic offers many tools for recycling (AU, crossover, mashup, self-insert, Mary Sue, the 12 varieties of slash etc) which takes the recombination of texts into the exponential. It is possible that with the enchanted duplication systems of fan-based epub, we might have arrived at a point in history where we've accumulated enough cultural material from the past for fans to remix indefinitely, and as they can now sell this content to each other this becomes a boom industry where none existed before. However, the point where fans become the creators, and a derivative work becomes the new original is also the point at which the culture industries stop needing to create anything new. Fanfic begets fanfic, which then in turn becomes mainstream which then begets further fanfic and so on. When we reach that point our future will not be fifty, but fifty thousand, shades of grey.</p> <p>\u2022 Ewan Morrison's fifth book Close Your Eyes is published by Jonathan Cape.

  "<p>It is hard to believe that the timing of moves by Egypt's president, Mohamed Morsi, to purge senior officers from the military and impose his power was purely coincidental. It was the 23rd day of Ramadan, the evening of the Night of Power, during which the Qur'an was first revealed to the Prophet Muhammad.</p> <p>The Qur'an states that the Night of Power \"is better than a thousand months\" \u2013 this seems apt considering that these changes seemingly put an end to many months of confusion about where power lies in the new Egypt.</p> <p>But is it for the better? And where does power lie now?</p> <p>Within the military, it is clear that the new figure of power is Abdel-Fatah el-Sissi, formerly head of military intelligence and now the minister of defence. </p> <p>Considerably younger that Hussein Tantawi, the ageing general he replaced who was first appointed by Hosni Mubarak in 1992, Sissi brings with him several younger officers. His ascension puts an end to a months-long power struggle over who is in control of the military.</p> <p>The lack of an immediate challenge to Sunday's moves suggests that, essentially, there has been a successful coup within the military, in alliance with Morsi. We also know this new military leadership is willing to give Morsi the powers their predecessors had refused him \u2013 Morsi could not have regained control without their help. This speaks not of a triumphant civilian president getting the generals in line, but of a confluence of interests. It does not tell us whether it will last, or where the balance of power lies.</p> <p>Recent events, notably the deadly assault by terrorists on an Egyptian border guard outpost in Sinai last week, provided the opportunity for Morsi and his uniformed allies to move against the army's old guard. The removal of Tantawi and other officers had been preceded by the sacking of the head of the intelligence services, a surprising move in itself. But it was an opportune event more than a cause in itself, as the limbo prevailing since Morsi's election, which had been robbed of its significance by last-minute changes to Egypt's interim constitution that had effectively made Tantawi a UN-elected co-president, could not last.</p> <p>Not only has the confusion over where official power lies been partly resolved, but efforts by anti-Morsi forces to push the military into deposing him (increasingly vocally expressed in the media) now seem moot.</p> <p>We do not know, however, what will come next. Morsi now has quasi-dictatorial powers in the absence of a parliament. Retired officers have been given golden parachutes and it is unlikely that they will be held accountable, as many revolutionaries demand, for the dozens of deaths and thousands of arbitrary military trials that took place under their watch.</p> <p>The prospect of a military-Islamist alliance is a chilling one, particularly considering the disarray of the secular opposition, who, as much as they support civilian rule, now worry about an Islamist power-grab.</p> <p>Much will depend on what Morsi does next. He has a responsibility to bring together a fractured country behind a consensual constitution and new parliamentary elections.</p> <p>He must balance the desires of his own Islamist camp with the fears of secularists, the demands for reform of revolutionaries with the conservatism of his new allies in the military. There is no excuse for lack of action, now that Morsi is finally empowered.</p> <p><em>Issandr El Amrani is a writer and analyst on Middle Eastern affairs.

  "<p>After a magical fortnight, Britain could not bear to let its guests do something so mundane as check in for a flight. Heathrow had its busiest Olympics departures day on Monday as it waved off 6,000 athletes through a specially constructed terminal, disguised as a London park.</p> <p>The pessimists may have been wrong about transport chaos, but the airport was taking no chances so close to the finishing line. Athletes were checked in remotely at the Olympic Village in Stratford, east London on Sunday \u2013 pre-closing ceremony and sober \u2013 and their bags dispatched overnight.</p> <p>A Terminal 4 car park had been transformed by a panoply of actors, fake deer, classic London street furniture and astroturf: if not quite Isles of Wonder, an extra touch \u2013 and easy passage through the airport \u2013 much appreciated by groggy Olympians.</p> <p>Security lanes were in operation, but with x-ray machines clad in a brickwork facade with London street names, and the cold steel of the scanners hidden in a welcoming neo-classical arch \u2013 which obliged some of the Russian volleyball team to stoop low to pass. Medals would not be trusted to the aircraft hold. Courtney Mathewson, of the US women's water polo team, said her gold medal was \"definitely coming in the backpack, all zipped up\". But carrying the medal made the process slower she said \u2013 everyone wanted to see it.</p> <p>A Coldstream guard stepped out of his sentry booth to envelope a Spanish athlete in a hug as warm as his bearskin. Two nearby police officers declined to hug, explaining that unlike the guard they were not actors but actual policemen, albeit broadly smiling ones. \"Great atmosphere isn't it?\" said the real Constable Kerr.</p> <p>Past security, a purple memory tree had athletes' scribbled testimonies of their favourite Olympic moments hung from the branches by another actor, \"Charles the park ranger\". From a US rower, Jamie Redman, came \"Mo's 10K run!! (so inspirational).\" Others cited the volunteers, the Olympic Park, and several mentioned the Spice Girls. One note read \"47.63 2 X GOLD\" \u2013 the time F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez posted to win the 400m hurdles at 2012 and 2004 Games. His tears on the podium during the Dominican Republic's national anthem were, Charles said, followed by \"getting pretty emotional\" at Heathrow's tree.</p> <p>Many athletes had not slept, while some who had tried were kept up by the music in the Olympic Village. Others spoke of longer-term fatigue after arriving in Britain for training camps in July. Neisha Bernard-Thomas, a Grenadan 800m runner eliminated in the semis, said: \"It's been a long month. I'm ready to go home.\"</p> <p>Some, like the valiant Canadian women's football team, had been partying for days. For others, the celebrations were far from over. Irish boxer Katie Taylor said she was \"a bit nervous\" about the festivities ahead, with a reception expected as she landed in Dublin and then much more in her home town of Bray. \"It's going to be a bit mad at home,\" she said, before posing with her gold medal in front of a cut-out Routemaster bus for one last London photo.</p> <p>Praise for the hosts came from many departing athletes. Kellie Wells, the 100m hurdles bronze medallist flying back to the US, spoke fondly of the \"beautiful fellowship\" and \"spectacular food\" in the Olympic Village, but had found equal delight in exploring the city beyond alone after her event. A stranger she asked for directions had walked her to the platform when she was lost, missing his own train; Wells had trekked up to a small north London salon for a haircut. \"They did a wonderful job\" she said.</p> <p>Heathrow boss Colin Matthews said the airport would be trying to find a way to hang on to the positives from the Olympics, even if his astroturfed terminal will be turned back into a car park on&#xa0;Thursday. But the aesthetics were a minor concern, he said: \"The difference really is enthusiastic staff and volunteers and happy passengers \u2013 it's infectious.\"</p> <p>Beyond the doors of this weird and wonderful terminal, buses took athletes straight to the departure gates. The Russian synchronised swimming team was whisked to a door in Terminal 4. At the bottom of the escalator, three of Heathrow's 1,300 pink-clad Games volunteers awaited them. \"Did you get gold?\" someone asked. \"Yes,\" one Russian beamed. \"We are win.\" And the Heathrow volunteers clapped them to the top.</p>",

It's not quite that far-out, but the music seems to nod to that era of celestial yearning, when R&amp;B cosmonaut Stevie Wonder worked with what were essentially an electronic prog duo called <a href=\"http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/_/10398393/Tontos+Expanding+Head+Band+tehb.jpg\" title=\"\">Tonto's Expanding Headband</a> and released albums with titles such as Innervisions and Fulfillingness' First Finale.</p> <p>Do not confuse them with King, the 80s funk-pop group led by Paul King, he of the daft haircut and painted DMs, who sang about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlXtrnh-Ejo\" title=\"\">Love and Pride</a>. No, they're three women \u2013 including Berklee College of Music alumnus and multi-instrumentalist Paris Strother \u2013 who write and produce their own material, a sort of quixotic R&amp;B that has piqued the interest of Prince, Erykah Badu and Questlove, prompting them all to go into tweet overdrive. Basically, if you liked the \"nu-soul\" of the late 90s and artists such as D'Angelo, Erykah Badu and Jill Scott, and worry that the genre was knocked off course by the more machine-minded likes of Timbaland and Rodney Jerkins, then you'll love what King do. The songs are jazzily loose and fluidly constructed, with whooshing synths and brass, which eschew passionate bellowing for a more rarified form of harmonising that connotes the mystical and divine, voices spiralling up into the ether as the players (mainly Paris and the odd extra musician on the rare instrument she's yet to master) drift free from their moorings.</p> <p>All three of the songs on The Story are excellent, even though their commercial chances are slim, if we use Beyonc\u00e9's sister <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/nov/10/popandrock\" title=\"\">Solange Knowles</a> as the measure \u2013 her weird, warped R&amp;B is the closest recent reference point we can think of for King, and sadly she failed to deliver, sales-wise. Still, who cares when the music's this fine. The eponymous opening track on King's EP literally sounds warped, as though it has been left out in the sun. The time signature is wonky and the melody off-kilter. It's a strange way to announce themselves: \"Goodbye and farewell,\" they warble, ever so sweetly, explaining that they're \"taking a trip \u2026 up to the land of the eternal sun\" in a \"mothership\" \u2013 the tropes are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jun/26/george-clinton-interview\" title=\"\">pure cosmic Clintonese</a>. Supernatural is Jazz&amp;B, with a handclappy, hippy-trippy lyric about love, 10,000 tiny soldiers marching through the singer's heart, falling under spells, magic and all. Final track Hey is the ballad, but it's way superior to those lachrymose schmaltzfests that tend to clog up the back end of most R&amp;B albums - this uses 70s astral imagery to convey a beauteous sense of wonderment and joy, the extended coda comprising two minutes of the title word repeated by the girls as though they're exhaling ecstasy - the feeling, not the drug, only you can't imagine the latter being any more heady or addictive.</p> <p><strong>The buzz</strong>: \"This is not the last of The Story, but more appropriately, a very compelling beginning\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://revivalist.okayplayer.com/2011/03/15/king-the-story/\" title=\"\">The Revivalist</a>.</p> <p><strong>The truth</strong>: They've fulfilled their first finale - now for the key of life.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to</strong>: Free your mind.</p> <p><strong>Least likely to</strong>: Reach the mothership.</p> <p><strong>What to buy</strong>: The Story is out now on Rough Trade.</p> <p><strong>File next to</strong>: Minnie Riperton, Solange Knowles, Erykah Badu, Estelle.</p> <p><strong>Links</strong>: <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/weareking-1/\" title=\"\">soundcloud.com/weareking-1</a>.</p> <p>Tuesday's new band: Halls.</p>",
  "<h2>Shorter, but not always sweet</h2> <p>When I first started coming to Edinburgh in the 1980s, most shows were around the 90-minute mark. During the 1990s, 75 minutes became the average; now the majority of shows are around the hour mark. If we carry on at this rate, by 2040 no play will last longer than <a href=\"http://www.samuel-beckett.net/breath.htm\">Samuel Beckett's Breath</a>. Shorter can certainly be punchier if not necessarily sweeter. Such is the case with <a href=\"http://www.esbaluard.org/en/activitats/326/companyia-res-de-res-remor/ \">Remor</a> at <a href=\"http://www.edfringe.com/venues/c-venues-c-nova\">C Nova</a>, the rather splendid new multi-space addition to the ever-growing C empire. Made by the Spanish company Res de Res, Remor lasts a mere 11 minutes, but is not the kind of show that you will forget in a hurry.</p> <p>The small audience enters a large box which once you get inside feels very claustrophobic and has almost the exact dimensions of a Spanish prison cell. Inside there is a small wash basin, a bunk bed and a table. There is a letter on the table. A woman lies on the top bunk and the man is in the bottom bed. He rises and opens the letter. What follows in a piece that is cleverly structured to snake back upon itself is an extraordinary pas de deux of loss and longing that could be taking place all in the mind or in entirely different places. The ambiguities are part of the show's power, as is the choreography that comes with great gusts of sadness and demonstrates that being imprisoned can really send you up the wall. </p> <p>Remor is not the only miniature on the fringe this year, which includes the 20-minute plays that make up Peep at the Pleasance Courtyard and also Red, Like Our Room Used to Feel at <a href=\"http://www.summerhall.co.uk\">Summerhall</a> by rising young poet <a href=\"http://ryanvanwinkle.com/about/\">Ryan Van Winkle</a> . The latter should be made available immediately on prescription to all fringe-goers, as it provides the antidote to the endless hustle and bustle of Edinburgh. In a secret, womb-like red room with a bed, you are offered tea and biscuits or a glass of port, and make a choice from one of four envelopes. Van Winkle then reads you the poems in that envelope. It's as simple as that, but it's strangely intimate and potent having poetry read to you. As you look around the room, you start to realise that there are visual echoes to the words. </p> <h2>Of spaghetti and access</h2> <p>There are plenty of love stories on this year's fringe, from Phil Porter's clever <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/05/blink-edinburgh-festival-review\">Blink</a> at the Traverse to Dirty Great Love Story at C , about which I've heard some good things (although I haven't seen it yet). But one of the most interesting is Pete Edwards' Fat at <a href=\"http://www.pleasance.co.uk\">Pleasance Courtyard</a> . <a href=\"http://www.petetheartist.co.uk/home.html \">Edwards</a> has cerebral palsy and has always seen his differing speech patterns and lack of control over his own limbs as an essential part of his creative work and not an obstacle to it. Every performance that Edwards makes has an element of uncertainty about it: Edwards has no idea if he will be able to make his body do what he wants it to do, when he wants it to do it. One of things that makes Fat so intriguing is the fact that it is not about disability, but is a love story about a gay man yearning for a fat man to take him home. Mixing film (rather magical shots of London's South Bank) and live performance, it turns into a touching fairytale and celebration of wish-fulfillment that features Edwards thrashing about naked in delicious-smelling spaghetti bolognaise.</p> <p>Of course coming to the fringe as a disabled artist or audience member is no picnic. Many spaces remain completely inaccessible, as a result of which disability is often rendered invisible on the fringe. So it's good to see the Pleasance supporting a disabled artist, and it will also be hosting a <a href=\"http://www.pleasance.co.uk/edinburgh/events/on-the-move-with-escalator-shifting-disability-debates-on-access-to-the-festival\">forum</a> on 21 August, which aims to shift discussion about disability at the festival and engender change. </p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>On the first Sunday of the fringe when it was raining cats and dogs, I hopped in a taxi. \"The rain must be good for business,\" I said. \"Oh no,\" replied the driver, \"nobody comes out in the rain.\" I also caught a cab this Sunday when the sun was shining. \"The sun must get everyone out and be good for business,\" I said. \"Oh no,\" replied the driver. \"When the sun comes out, everyone walks.\"</p> <h2>Glimpses of the future</h2> <p>At the <a href=\"http://www.edfringe.com/arts-industry\">fringe promoters breakfast</a> at Fringe Central on Sunday, I spoke briefly about my love of the fringe and why after almost 30 years of festival-going I still find it one of the most exciting places on earth. It offers endless possibilities, and I seldom leave without having caught at least a fleeting glimpse of the future of British theatre. Yesterday I saw a show called The Darkroom at C by a student company from Sussex. It wasn't must-rush-and-see brilliant, but the promise of writer/director Ellen Carr was obvious. </p> <h2>A bit of blatant self-promotion</h2> <p>My affection for the fringe extends to my own writing for children. Tomorrow you'll find me at the<a href=\"http://www.edbookfest.co.uk/the-festival/whats-on/stage-school-star-with-lyn-gardner\"> book festival</a> talking about my <a href=\"http://nosycrow.com/books/lyn-gardner\">Olivia series</a>, which is about a performing arts school and in particular about Olivia's Enchanted Summer which is set in Edinburgh on the fringe. In the unlikely event you are reading this blog and a girl aged 8 to 12, do come.</p>",
  "<h2>Introduction</h2> <p>Do you wear tweed? Like the smell of rubber galoshes? Hate pheasants? Then shooting may just be the sport for you. Of course, you won't actually get to kill anything, because the Olympic Games and indeed real life are not similar to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142857/hunger-games\">The Hunger Games</a>. Instead you'll be aiming at non-living targets, both moving and stationary.</p> <h2>The basics</h2> <p>It's not hard to grasp the basics of shooting. You have a gun and you point, aim and fire it at a target. Sometimes the target is moving. At the Games, shooting events fall into three disciplines: rifle, pistol and shotgun. Depending on the event, athletes are required to shoot from standing, kneeling or lying down. As a non-Olympian, you'll probably start at a clay pigeon shooting club, standing up.</p> <h2>Health benefits</h2> <p>You're not going to gain too much muscle tone from shooting, but co-ordination, stamina and the ability to lower your heartbeat is essential if you are to consistently hit the target.</p> <h2>Equipment, costs and practicalities</h2> <p>Many clubs offer taster sessions, so you can see if shooting is for you without the danger of having to approach your local arch-criminal to see if he/she can give you a go on their sawn-off shotgun. There are also beginners' courses that go through the basics, including all the safety aspects, to help get you started. You can find a local club on the <a href=\"http://www.cpsa.co.uk/\"><br>Clay Pigeon Shooting Association website</a>.</p> <h2>Trendiness rating: 7/10 </h2> <p>It's got guns \u2013 hi-tech guns at that. If you <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/shooting/about/\">watch the video</a> on the Olympic website, you'll see competitors wearing futuristic clobber and looking like James Bond circa 2020. It's pretty trendy. However, we're deducting points because men and women competed against each other until 1992, when China's Zhang Shan became the first woman to win gold in a mixed-gender event. After these Games, the <a href=\"http://www.issf-sports.org/\">ISSF</a> stopped men and women competing against each other. Sexist.</p> <h2>Inside line</h2> <p><strong>Phil Scanlan, Team GB shooting coach:</strong> \"Shooting covers many different disciplines that can be enjoyed by people of all types, regardless of social background, age, shape, size and gender. Young and old can compete side by side, and it's probably one of the few sports that a beginner can compete in directly alongside an Olympian. It teaches self-control, and depending on the discipline can be enjoyed summer and winter, indoors and out!\"</p> <h2>Find out more</h2> <p><a href=\"http://britishshooting.org.uk/\">britishshooting.org.uk</a> - find a club near you through the Great British Target Shooting Association.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nra.org.uk/\">nra.org.uk</a> - the National Rifle Association.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cpsa.co.uk/\">cpsa.co.uk</a> - Clay Pigeon Shooting Association.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.stsf.org.uk/\">stsf.org.uk</a> - Scottish Target Shooting.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nra.org.uk\">nra.org.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nsra.org.uk\">nsra.org.uk</a> - rifle and pistol shooting.</p> <h2>You may also like</h2> <p>Fencing, archery.</p> <h2>You might hate</h2> <p>Clay pigeons, mountain biking.</p> <h2>Over to you</h2> <p>Do you shoot?

There's lots on the German language, and how harsh it sounds. There's some playful boasting about Germany's economic success.

  "<p>While Syria's civil war dominates the world's attention, less dramatic and telegenic events in Egypt retain the power to decide if popular uprisings will succeed in establishing a democratic alternative to tyranny in the Arab world.</p> <p>Something of that magnitude has just happened in Cairo. Arguably it is just as significant as the ousting of Hosni Mubarak in February last year. The system was decapitated but continued in the form of the military council, which assumed transitional rule. On Sunday the heads of that system, which has dominated Egypt for decades, were toppled \u2013 apparently with its acquiescence.</p> <p>In forcing the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/12/egyptian-defence-chief-ousted-shakeup\" title=\"\">departure of his defence minister and Hussein Tantawi, the head of Scaf (the Supreme Council of Armed Forces</a> ), President Mohamed Morsi was not just getting rid of an ageing field marshall who had been central to the Mubarak era, and replacing him with the youngest member of Scaf, establishing the continuity of the system. He was changing the balance of power.</p> <p>Morsi got rid of the man who was expected to replace Tantawi \u2013 the army chief of staff, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/12/mohamed-morsi-orders-generals-retire?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Sami Enan</a> \u2013 as well as the leader of every service of the armed forces. Tantawi's replacement, the head of military intelligence Abdel-Fatah el-Sissi, will now report to Morsi himself, not to Scaf. Further, Morsi annulled the constitutional power grab that Scaf made on the second day of the presidential election in June, which gave the military a right of veto over the new constitution that is in the process of being drawn up.</p> <p>Accused by the left and liberals of political weakness, of cohabiting with the military, the Muslim Brotherhood president today stands accused of the opposite contention \u2013 accruing too much power. And it is true, that in assuming for himself the power Scaf had to appoint a new constituent assembly should the current one writing the constitution fail to agree, the Egyptian president now has the powers of a Russian one. But Morsi is no Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>First, the powers Morsi has assumed are time-limited. The constitution is already mostly written, and should be finished by early September. Its work will be put to a referendum, and within two months of that, there will be fresh parliamentary elections. Morsi's vast powers as president will only last for three months at the most before he puts his actions to the test of a popular vote.</p> <p>Second, to ensure that the vote is indeed popular, Morsi appointed two brothers, both respected judges who are independent of the Brotherhood: Mahmoud Mekky, a senior judge, is now his vice-president, and Ahmed Mekky is his justice minister. The Mekky brothers are part of the Reform Movement within the judiciary, and its agenda is to roll back the powers of the second arm of the Mubarak military state \u2013 its politically appointed constitutional court. Both men were part of the so-called judge's revolt after the tainted Mubarak elections in 2005. Civil society and the rule of law could not have two better non-Islamist champions.</p> <p>Of course, a darker interpretation can be put on Morsi's actions. If the constituent assembly cannot agree on a constitution, Morsi has the power to appoint a new one. He could also continue to rule by decree. Some analysts are pessimistic about what they see as the Brotherhood's sense of electoral entitlement.</p> <p>That may indeed exist below the democratic patina of these declarations. But doubters should ask themselves what the alternative is, given that the role of the transition is to establish a new civil order, with the military back in its barracks. Shortly after Scaf issued its constitutional decree in June, a broad coalition of the opposition met in the Fairmont Hotel in Cairo and issued a declaration promising to undo Scaf's move. Morsi is now fulfilling this.</p> <p>The test of the power he now holds will be his ability to share it with other constituencies who are suspicious of the Brotherhood \u2013 Christians, secularists, liberals, the left \u2013 and establish the effective government the country so desperately needs. For the moment, Morsi should be given the benefit of the doubt.</p>",

  "<p>Nearby, the Olympic Stadium glows in the darkness. The surveillance blimp hovers above, monitoring a throng of people leaving the park. By 11pm it's only us, the night workers, who remain.</p> <p>Devoid of visitors, the park is a very different landscape. \"It's beautiful, like a space village,\" says one of my co-workers. In the calm, cleaners move around preparing for the next day.</p> <p>The night shift is popular with the younger G4S workers, and a crowd of teenagers arrive two hours early to be sure of being deployed. Working at the gates during the day is regimented and there are very few breaks. Locog officials are always around, keeping a close eye and reporting any minor misdemeanours. \"Day shifts are too busy. On the night shift you can do what you want,\" explains one of the regulars.</p> <p>The night before I didn't manage to get deployed. Instead, I joined the group of 50 hopefuls waiting at Cherry Park, the main G4S hub in Stratford. We stayed there for four hours, watching the Olympics on TV, chatting, making tea and playing cards. It was frustrating.</p> <p>At 11pm a request for workers at Greenwich came through. Fifteen of us leapt at the chance and headed off. When we arrived it was clear we weren't needed there either. After we had waited for another hour, our team leader arrived. He was stressed out. \"We can't fit you in, I'm sorry. You'll have to go home.\"</p> <p>Some of the group were angry; they'd been counting on being paid for a full shift. But no one was surprised: the chaos of scheduling is a common problem when you work for G4S.</p> <p>Those who are lucky enough to get on the night shift seem to enjoy it. It's very tiring keeping yourself awake all night, but there's little work to do. G4S has more than 35 of us manning the Rapiscan x-ray machines at the gate I'm working at.</p> <p>From 10pm\u20135am we have fewer than 100 people coming through. It's clear that some simple reorganisation could trim the workforce down to seven. Instead, we spend the night hanging around by the x-ray machines or going for long breaks in the empty canteens. Everyone is hyper, buzzed up on ProPlus, energy drinks and cheap coffee.</p> <p>At night, anything goes. Operating the Rapiscan is the best job. I'm trained to do this, but because I'm not a regular I'm relegated to body searches. Others on the team take over.</p> <p>There's an 18-year-old operating the x-ray machine on my team. He might not have been trained by G4S, but he's seriously bright and is running our team efficiently. He points out better ways to screen the bags and is an excellent body searcher too. Further evidence that the story of the G4S Olympics seems to have been one of effort by those on the ground prevailing over disorganisation from above.</p> <p>It's a humid night and by 4am we're all beginning to wilt. Three more hours to go. The light in the white tents is attracting huge mosquitos that bite through our cheap nylon trousers. G4S bumbags are stuffed with prohibited items \"liberated\" from the rubbish boxes.</p> <p>A bored policeman wanders over to chat. He shows me his gun and we trade stories of screwed-up rotas. Apparently the eight-hour police shifts have crept up to 14 hours. He's looking forward to the end of the Games.</p> <p>At 5.30am, just when I think I can't go on any longer, the park comes alive. Dawn is breaking and it's suddenly manic as the army, police and workers start flooding in. The x-ray machine is back on, the metal detector starts beeping, and in the final hour I do more than 30 body searches. The Olympic machine is gearing up for another day.</p> <p>An hour later I'm ordered to stand down as another body searcher takes over. I've never felt this tired. Tonight has been another insight into G4S mismanagement. Yet the initiative of workers on the ground is what saves the company from chaos. Sometimes I can't help thinking they don't deserve the team they have.</p>",
  "<p>At times it seemed there had been a kind of benign British coup. No traffic allowed in Whitehall or the Mall. Groups of (unarmed) squaddies engaged politely with passers-by.</p> <p>Opposite the Isle of Dogs, HMS Ocean, the navy's biggest ship, was moored with Lynx helicopters on board. Special Boat Service commandos sped along the river Thames in inflatable craft.</p> <p>High velocity missiles were perched on the top of tower blocks \u2014 an unprecedented peacetime use of residential areas.</p> <p>Ready-to-scramble Typhoon jets were parked at RAF Northolt, the first time fighters had been based at the west London airfield since the second world war.</p> <p>It was described by ministers and intelligence chiefs as the UK's biggest peacetime security operation. It involved about 17,000 troops and reported to cost more than \u00a31bn. The Olympic and Paralympic Games have placed MI5, MI6, and GCHQ, the government's electronic eavesdropping agency, \"particularly\" MI5, \"under unprecedented pressure\", said the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) in its latest annual report.</p> <p>They faced the prospect of \"having to cope with double the normal volume of new intelligence leads, with peaks of possibly four times greater than usual\".</p> <p>MI5 also had to cope with what the committee called \"the burden of the accreditation process (which requires all 540,000 applications from those working at the venues, as well as officials, volunteers and team members, to be checked against relevant databases to identify anyone whose presence may be a threat to national security)\".</p> <p>Much has been said about the legacy of the Olympics for sports funding and investment in British youngsters. Much less has been said about the implications for the future role of the security services in monitoring and policing British citizens, the security legacy. The authors of Politics and the London 2012 Olympics: the (in)security Games, <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2346.2012.01097.x/abstract;jsessionid=964D608C05B7DDD527DB022644372233.d01t01?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false\">published </a>in the journal, International Affairs, describe \"an increased securitization of the host city and other Olympic event locations which has the potential to leave a lasting legacy\".</p> <p>The Olympics took place against the background of \"a steady blurring of the boundary between external and internal threat, between military defence and civilian policing, and between war and peacetime security\", warn Barrie Houlihan and Richard Giulianotti. The danger was compounded by a growing tendency of intense aversion to risk.</p> <p>\"The Olympic Games and other mega-sport events become opportunities not only to test and refine security technology and strategies, but also to assess the level of public acceptance of increased levels of surveillance, add the two authors of the International Affairs essay.</p> <p>They refer to the \"security creep\" that is occurring in wider society and warn that \"temporary\" restrictions \u2014 along the lines of those in the Olympics and Paralympics Games Act 2006? \u2014 often proved long-lasting \"leading to a permanent state of exception in which citizens are complicit in the erosion of their civil liberties\".</p> <p>The enthusiasm, lack of cynicism, the sheer spirit in the Olympic Park and elsewhere suggest those citizens might resist any such an erosion.</p> <p>It would be a huge irony if more security controls became part of the legacy of the Olympics whose charter emphasises the principles of peace, ethics, and fair play, (an even greater irony given that Somalia, seen by Britain's security and intelligence agencies as a new training ground for British jihadists, was the birthplace of Mo Farah).</p> <p>Intelligence sources express delight at the way the Olympics went. There is a huge collective relief in Britain's security establishment.</p> <p>Did all those expensive security measures in place deter any planned attacks? We may never know.</p>",
  "<p>The UK prime minister, David Cameron, has committed himself to reducing child malnutrition rates in poor countries as Britain takes over the presidency of the G8 group of leading industrialised countries next year.</p> <p>A \"hunger summit\" at No 10 Downing Street on Sunday announced measures to reduce the number of children left stunted by malnourishment worldwide by as much as 25 million by 2016, when Rio de Janeiro stages the next Olympics. The intitiative will contribute to a UN target to reduce the number of stunted children by 70 million by 2025.</p> <p>Malnutrition is an underlying cause of more than a third of children's deaths \u2013 2.6 million a year. But it is not always recognised or recorded on death certificates, which is in part why it has not been effectively addressed.</p> <p>Britain said it would back <a href=\"http://www.cgiar.org/\" title=\"\">research into creating drought-resistant and vitamin-enriched crops</a> that could help feed 45 million people for a year in Asia and Africa, as well supporting the development of nutrition-rich seeds and tubers to benefit 3 million people in African and India. The private sector will play a role, with companies such as Unilever, Syngenta and GSK working to find ways to make nutritious food available to poor families at affordable prices.</p> <p>It is estimated that long-term exposure to a poor and inadequate diet and repeated infections have left 170 million children in the world suffering from stunting, a condition that stops children's bodies from growing and developing properly.</p> <p>The hunger summit, co-hosted by Michel Temer, Brazil's vice-president, and attended by Mo Farah, the double Olympic champion, was born out of the G8 summit in the US in May, when President Barack Obama announced a <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/05/18/fact-sheet-g-8-action-food-security-and-nutrition\" title=\"\">food security initiative with African leaders and the private sector</a>. British NGOs, particularly <a href=\"http://www.one.org/international/\" title=\"\">One</a> and <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Save the Children</a>, wanted to maintain the momentum on tackling hunger and particularly nutrition. Given that Britain takes over the G8 presidency next year, while Ireland assumes the presidency of the EU, it was felt that David Cameron and <a href=\"http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0812/irish-eu-presidency-will-push-hunger-prevention.html\" title=\"\">Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny, who attended the hunger summit</a>, would be ideally placed to keep hunger on the international agenda.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/may/09/johnson-sirleaf-yudhoyono-cameron-development\" title=\"\">Cameron has also been appointed to a UN high-level panel</a> to consider what should follow the millennium development goals (MDGs), which are set to expire in 2015, while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/07/nigerian-indonesian-officials-post-busan-panel\" title=\"\">Andrew Mitchell, the international development secretary, is on another high-level panel on development effectiveness</a>.</p> <p>\"Cameron has a real opportunity to shape the agenda by 2015,\" said Molly Kinder, One's director for agriculture and Europe policy.</p> <p>Kinder said she was impressed by the level of substance that came out of the hunger summit, and particularly by the EU's specific pledge to take responsibility for reducing the number of stunted children in the world by 7 million by 2025.</p> <p>\"The UK is very results-focused, the EU less so, [so] it signals a strong commitment from the EU,\" she said.</p> <p>Kinder added that India's decision to double its budget for improving the health and nutrition of 100 million women and children was also encouraging.</p> <p>\"India is the elephant in the room, a low-level performer in nutrition despite its strong economic growth,\" she said.</p> <p>Other campaigners welcomed the high-level focus on global hunger, but said more fundamental change was needed. War on Want pointed to evidence from its recent <a href=\"http://www.waronwant.org/overseas-work/17394-food-sovereignty-report\" title=\"\">food sovereignty report</a> that sustainable farming under the alternative framework of agroecology \u2013 which minimises external inputs, such as fertilisers \u2013 has proved its worth in tackling both hunger and environmental degradation.</p> <p>\"The real issue is that the global food system is set up to allow for the maximum control of big agricultural companies like Cargill,\" said executive director John Hilary. \"As long as enormous control of the food system lies within the hands of companies, power is removed from small farmers.\"</p> <p>Hilary argued that China and Brazil made strides in reducing hunger and helped move the world towards the MDGs by returning power to smallholder farmers.</p> <p>\"Where it's happened, we've seen massive gains,\" he said. \"In Brazil, hunger was reduced following a huge increase in family farming and the resettlement of the homeless on land. China in the 1980s built a post-Mao settlement by returning power to small farmers and rural communities.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jul/06/sam-dryden-global-south-agriculture\" title=\"\">Sam Dryden, the Gates Foundation's head of agriculture</a>, who attended the hunger summit, acknowledged the pressure of large corporations \u2013 as well as agricultural subsidies in the west \u2013 in squeezing out smallholder farmers in Africa.</p> <p>\"If you let them [large corporations] dictate what gets grown, that can happen,\" he said. \"Agriculture is a local experience, eating is a local experience. It is important that African countries develop their own systems and that smallholder farmers grow the crops they want to grow.\"</p>",
  "<p>To be fair, it might have been a bit more effective if only Caf\u00e9 Iris had been open. Lee Newell and Ally Young \u2013 the former previously the singer with the widely reviled <a href=\"http://www.acidlove.net/\">Viva Brother</a>, the latter once of the synth-pop group <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/mar/13/new-band-mirrors\">Mirrors</a> \u2013 have arrived in the uniform of their new group, <a href=\"http://www.lvlf.info/\">Lovelife</a>. They are clad head to toe in black, buttoned to colllar and cuff, a modest selection of bling around their necks. They look fresh, waiting at the curb when I arrive, luggage in tow, straight from Penn Station.</p> <p>The problem is that Caf\u00e9 Iris is closed. There is nowhere else in sight to sit and talk. And Brooklyn Heights is sweating its way to a storm later. So we walk and we walk and we walk, finding one place too full, another too quick for our needs, another closed for renovation. By the time we reach a basement Chinese, neither 24-year-old Newell nor Young, who's 25, look quite as fresh as they did. Nor do I, but then I haven't dressed like I'm daring myself not to sweat.</p> <p>They say dressing in black makes them stand out, like a band. I point out that anyone dressed like that on a day this hot is going to be stared at, and possibly not because they look like they're in a band. If they weren't so good humoured about the ridiculousness of it all, you'd want to laugh at them. But that would just be cruel: they're here in first place because of <a href=\"http://thequietus.com/articles/05506-2011-tips-brother/\">people laughing</a>.</p> <p>Viva Brother's story is extraordinary. The brevity of their ascent through late 2010 \u2013 from unknowns to <a href=\"http://stickylipsmusic.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/brother-nme-cover-thumb-400x495-44300.jpg\">NME cover stars</a> in months, from first London gig to major label deal \u2013 was matched only by the speed of their fall in 2011, a fall ended by their announcement on 1 April this year that they had split, at which point the world pointed and snorted its derision. </p> <p>Some of what happened was the result of the band's misjudgments. The promises Newell made about their brilliance \u2013 \"Anyone who doesn't want to see the future of rock'n'roll should leave now,\" he told the crowd at their London debut \u2013 couldn't be kept by the unremarkable \"grit pop\" they delivered. Then their past as an emo group was used as evidence they were cynics just searching around for a market no one else was tapping. By the time their debut album was released, there was no one crowing their support, and <a href=\"http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4143232-disband-7--viva-brother\">one major interview</a> to promote its release a year ago was predicated entirely around how much everyone hated them. </p> <p>Newell's less prone to Muhammad Ali-ish statements of his own greatness now. \"I guess I was being Billy Big Bollocks,\" he says. \"It was my own fault. When everyone tells you you're the next best thing, you go one of two ways. You either start believing it or you fight it. And I went with it.\" And people were telling them to their face they were the next big thing, but then almost with the next breath mocking them behind their back. When the group played a showcase at the Met Bar in London in autumn 2010 \u2013 still nearly a year away from releasing their album \u2013 the room was thick with people doing just that. Viva Brother's fate was almost certainly preordained.</p> <p>Both Newell and Young, it must be said, are understandably keener to talk about Lovelife than Viva Brother. They talk about how they, and the three other former members of Viva Brother, who now serve as the backing band, share a two-bedroom apartment and work in coffee shops to pay the bills. They talk about their Tuesday night residency at Piano's in the Lower East Side, about the major labels who've come to see them playing their slinky R&amp;B-tinged synth-pop, about being invited to play with blog favourites <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2012/aug/08/neighbourhood-female-robbery\">the Neighbourhood</a>, about how happy they are to be in control of their own destinies. I don't doubt them, and it should be said Lovelife are an awful lot better than Viva Brother were.</p> <p>But, as Newell says: \"I don't want to make this all about me, but that's part of the reason you're here.\" Young is a little less succinct: \"Even when people look at the press shots, which are of Lee and I, it's still Brother, Brother, Brother. But part of the reason we decided to move to New York is that the guys didn't have such a profile out there and we could launch it as a new thing because it is a new thing. And as soon as they cottoned on to us NME said: 'Viva Brother are back, rebranded, they're a boy band.' It's just not true. I wasn't in Viva Brother. I don't mean to sound like it has embittered me, but it has to a certain extent.\"</p> <p>NME can do nothing right in Newell's eyes. It's the title that picked him up and dropped him from a great height. \"They're getting away with murder,\" he says. \"You know what? Much as I love the Stone Roses, I was absolutely gutted they got back together because I thought: that's gonna keep NME in business for another fucking year.\"</p> <p>But if you say you're the future of music, or offer countless similar hostages to fortune, as Newell did, you're asking for them to be returned with interest. He agrees, and offers his regrets. \"Much as I spoke it and gave it, I wasn't holding my head high at all, to the point where I was embarrassed. We wrote those Brother songs so quickly, we didn't know what we were doing \u2013 they weren't about anything. Just songs. And I had nothing to sing about. My life was fine. I wanted to be in a band, but I didn't feel I had a message \u2013 I just wanted to be a rock star. That's not who I was. I don't know why I did that. To prove something to myself?\"</p> <p>And all the stories \u2013 quickly debunked \u2013 about them being Tough Lads from the Estates? Not his fault, Newell says: \"I never said I was a tough lad.\"</p> <p>You called your music \"grit pop\". He snorts, then repeats the word with a disparaging wonder.</p> <p>You let people make wrong assumptions about you and never corrected them. \"Why would I? If people want to assume things that will get one further, why not?\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4XepQEQ8PcM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4XepQEQ8PcM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4XepQEQ8PcM\">Reading on mobile? Watch here</a></p> <p>Behind the facade, things were unravelling quickly. Even as Viva Brother launched \u2013 initially as Brother \u2013 they had to dispense with a member, a long-time friend. Before the album came out they were forced to add the Viva to their name after an Australian band bearing didgeridoos threatened to sue. Then Geffen, the label that had signed them, was folded into Sony, leaving them isolated. </p> <p>There were symbolic knockbacks, too: \"My hero Morrissey kicked us off his tour [Viva Brother were the opening act]. We never met him. The first night he got his people to tell me: 'You're talking too much to the crowd.' I wasn't. I was on my best behaviour because it's Morrissey. He's my hero. So the next night I didn't talk to the crowd and just said: 'Thank you, we're honoured to be here.' He was: 'I'm afraid you overstepped the mark.'\"</p> <p>Eventually, it was all too much. \"I suffer from depression,\" Newell says. \"I've got a mild form of bipolar as well. And last year broke me. I broke up with my girlfriend, the band's fucked, I had to move out of her place, and \u2013 God, what am I going to do now? And that's when Ally stepped in.\"</p> <p>\"I could see from very early that the way you were perceived was a million miles away from the quite fragile person you were at the time,\" Young offers, consolingly.</p> <p>Was the level of vitriol \u2013 not just from critics, but across social media \u2013 a surprise?</p> <p>\"I'm not surprised.\" Newell says. \"I was upset, but I wasn't surprised.\"</p> <p>\"I was surprised,\" Young tells him. \"Maybe naively. But the things people say with the anonymity of the internet shock me \u2013 things you wouldn't dream of saying to someone's face in the street. It's probably a naive way to think, but the personal abuse you got I found quite shocking.\"</p> <p>The last of the Geffen money enabled the relocation to Brooklyn at the start of this summer. And now? \"The fact is, if I was successful from those Brother songs I would be unhappy,\" Newell says. \"But I'm here now and I'm not successful, but I am happy. I don't strive to be the biggest band in the world any more. I just strive to write, be with my best friends as much as I can, and if music will one day pay for that, that would be amazing.\"</p> <p>I don't believe that. I don't believe someone with that much chutzpah and desire to succeed wants only to make a subsistence living, risking the same opprobrium all over again. I don't believe that of Young either, who has thrown in his lot with a group of musicians few would expect to be welcomed with opening arms. \"It's not the limit of our ambitions,\" he accepts. \"But both of us have grown up so much in the last 18 months. We both wanted that and chased it, and we both learned enough to know that if you want it you have to make it happen without chasing it at all costs. And it's a fine line. The only way we're gonna get there is by writing great music. That's all we can do. We can only get longevity if we write music people love.\"</p> <p>Before we leave, we crack open the fortune cookies that have been left on the table. \"You will have many friends when you need them,\" Young reads. \"Mine says: Make big plans,\" adds Newell. And head to toe dressed all in black, they leave the air-conditioned basement and go outside to look like they're in a band.</p>",
  "<p>For once, Afghanistan was just another country. Used to being treated as victim or headache on the international stage, its athletes lined up at the Olympics to compete as equals and revelled in showing the world another face, unconnected to decades of conflict.</p> <p>For Afghans back home, it was an emotional rollercoaster. Two weeks of competition brought the glory of the country's second ever medal, dashed hopes of a third, triumph in getting one over on its powerful neighbour Pakistan, and anger over the role of an old enemy \u2013 corruption.</p> <p>The divided nation was seized by a brief, unifying fit of taekwondo fever as the diminutive fighter who is probably the country's biggest sporting hero took to the mats. Rohullah Nikpai, whose Olympic profile lists his profession as hairdresser, is an unlikely champion: a poor former refugee, he is from the Hazara ethnic minority, which has long faced discrimination from more dominant groups.</p> <p>But his background meant nothing to millions of Afghans when he unexpectedly claimed a bronze medal in Beijing, becoming the first person from their country to stand on an Olympic podium.</p> <p>Half of Kabul stayed up late to watch him clinch another bronze in London, and one of the city's regular power cuts sent men streaming out to ice-cream stalls and other shops with generators to catch the end of one fight.</p> <p>There was joy across the country, and an explosion of excitement on social media, which has been embraced by the tiny but growing elite with internet access.</p> <p>An international community pleased to have something to celebrate in the middle of a decade-long war jumped on the bandwagon, with congratulations from the US embassy and the Nato-led coalition that has been fighting in Afghanistan for more than a decade.</p> <p>There was also elation that Afghanistan had bettered their richer and more powerful neighbour Pakistan, which has long been resented for interference in Afghan affairs.</p> <p>\"Afghanistan's Rohullah Nikpai wins Taekwondo bronze!! That's one more medal than its failed enemy, Pakistan,\" @Afghanpolicy crowed on twitter.</p> <p>The only people not caught up in the excitement seemed to be the Taliban. \"We are considering a reaction to this. Cannot say whether happy for the medal or not,\" a spokesman for the insurgent group told the BBC's Harun Najafizada.</p> <p>The country's second medal hope, Nesar Bahawi \u2013 another taekwondo fighter \u2013 lost his bronze medal bout. But having fought with injuries so severe he was taken to hospital after the match, his bravery won the hearts of Afghans.</p> <p>The aftermath of Nikpai's victory and Bahawi's near-miss also reflected some of Afghanistan's perennial problems. Government critics noted that Americans were faster than their own president to congratulate their double hero.</p> <p>And there was anger when it emerged that the country's 22-strong Olympic delegation did not include a physiotherapist. Arif Paiman, spokesman for the Olympic committee headed by Lieutenant General Muhammad Zahir Aghbar, said London organisers provided doctors for all competitors. But both taekwondo fighters were battling with injuries that might have been better managed by someone who knew them personally.</p> <p>Activists blamed corruption, a common scourge in a country that has been judged the fourth most graft-ridden in the world. \"Because every post is a political position and acquired based on affiliations to warlords and power-holders, the position of head of the Olympic committee is given to an army general who should instead be fighting the insurgency up in the mountains,\" said activist Wazhma Frogh.</p> <p>\"[Yusufzai] isn't a trained sports expert, that's why he takes his bodyguards and friends on sports-related trips \u2026 while there was no physiotherapist for injured Bahawi.\"</p> <p><em>Mokhtar Amiri contributed reporting</em></p>",

  "<p>The lemon was almost too big for Vincenzo Crescenzo's grimy palm. With his nails, he scratched the fruit's bumpy skin until the white pith showed through.</p> <p>\"Smell that,\" he said, as a pungent aroma infused the steamy air of the orchard. It was 9am and Crescenzo had finished work for the day. At this time of year, he begins at five and continues \"until the heat becomes too great\".</p> <p>Crescenzo started working in the lemon groves of the Amalfi coast when he was 10. Apart from military service, and a spell as a migrant worker in Switzerland, he has worked in them ever since, growing the <em>sfusato</em> lemon \u2013&#xa0;so-called because, with its pointed ends, it looks much like a spindle, a <em>fuso</em> in Italian.</p> <p>The orchard, owned by a Roman, is tiny: five terraces with about 150 trees set into a precipitous hillside that falls away to the glittering Bay of Salerno. In a few days, Crescenzo will begin to harvest.</p> <p>This summer, he can expect around 50 cents (39p) a kilo \u2013 a big improvement on last year. Even so, the harvest will not yield a profit. \"The owner has had this orchard for 15 years and she's never once got back her costs,\" he said.</p> <p>For 73-year-old Crescenzo too, lemon-growing is something of a hobby. Like most of the others who work the orchards above Cetara, he is a pensioner. \"Young people don't go into this job,\" he said. \"They can't make any money.\"</p> <p>Behind him was one reason why: the ferry from Palermo, lazily gouging an arc of backwash through the azure surface of the bay. The route from Sicily is called the \"sea motorway\". It offers truckers an inexpensive way to shorten their journey to the markets of central and northern Italy. Many of the lorries aboard were no doubt carrying lemons far cheaper to grow than a <em>sfusato</em>.</p> <p>Along the coast in Maiori, Carlo de Riso, manager of the area's main sorting and packing plant, describes the growing of this gourmet's delight as \"heroic agriculture\". The lemons are brought down to his plant on the backs of labourers, each carrying a bag containing 57kg of fruit.</p> <p>Quixotic might be a better description than heroic, were it not that the <em>sfusato </em>brings with it a vital guarantee. \"The lemon farmers here are the sentinels of the environment,\" said Angelo Amato, vice-president of the consortium for the protection of the Amalfi coast lemon.</p> <p>With its steep cliffs, the coast is susceptible to landslides. The roots of the lemon trees help to stabilise the ground, and the dry stone walls of the terraces also play a crucial role.</p> <p>\"They are made so that the rainwater which is needed stays, while the rest drains away,\" said Mario Tozzi, a researcher at the National Research Council (CNR).</p> <p>The last deadly landslide was two years ago. But there are fears that, if the lemon groves disappear along with their mostly elderly cultivators, the area could see a major disaster like the landslides that killed 161 people in the nearby inland town of Sarno in 1998.</p> <p>\"There are some similarities,\" said Tozzi. \"The old woods above Sarno had been replaced by hazelnut trees with shallow roots.\"</p> <p>Several attempts have been made to give the <em>sfusato</em> a future. The 1990s saw the limoncello liqueur, which nowadays absorbs about 10% of the crop.</p> <p>True Amalfi coast limoncello is exquisite: airily bittersweet. But its success has led to the marketing of imitations, made either with essence or fruit that does not qualify for the protected geographical indication (PGI) the EU has conferred on Amalfi coastal lemons.</p> <p>A law was passed four years ago to give the farmers subsidies. But no funds have been found to make it effective.</p> <p>One hope for the future lies with the new, mainly young leadership of the consortium. In May, Carlo de Riso's cousin, an internationally renowned pastry chef, Sal De Riso, was chosen as&#xa0;president.</p> <p>\"I use 5,000kg of lemons a year,\" he said at his little factory, high in the mountains above the coast. De Riso said one of his aims was to put a squeeze on big firms which make <em>panettone</em> and use&#xa0;minute quantities of the Amalfi coast's lemons so they can put the PGI emblem on their packaging. They were being asked to include a minimum proportion and pay a fee to use the symbol, he said.</p> <p>The consortium is also working with the CNR to find uses for the huge number of lemons that are discarded. For every 10kg that reach the market, 16-18kg are picked. The leftovers could go into juices, ice cream and even beauty products.</p> <p>Ultimately, though, said Amato, the future depended on making the business more efficient and drawing in younger people. \"With modern irrigation equipment and a minimum of between 7,000 and 10,000 sq metres of land, you can turn a profit,\" he said.</p> <p>Of late, lemon-growing on the Amalfi coast has received a boost from an unlikely source. \"The economic crisis is bringing people back to the land,\" said De Riso. \"We even have lawyers and engineers who have returned to work the orchards belonging to their families\".</p>",
  "<p>Cristina Roman didn't know where to begin. When asked how the epic violence and criminal impunity in her native Ciudad Juarez invaded her own life, she paused, then asked: \"How far should I go back?\"</p> <p>She decided to begin from May 2010. It was then at the height of the bloodletting there in Mexico's deadliest city when, one night at 4am, she, her husband and three sons awoke to a terrible pounding at their front door. \"My husband went to see who they were. Then he said: 'Go hide with the kids.

These are innocent victims of the Mexican drug war. In the words of their immigration lawyer, Carlos Spector, an immigration lawyer in El Paso, Texas, where most of these exiles end up, they \"risked their lives for truth and justice in Mexico\" and were \"forced to leave because of the Mexican government's failure or unwillingness to protect them\". </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-457479540\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/13/1344866029306/Missing-persons-poster-in-001.jpg\" alt=\"Missing persons poster in Mexico\" width=\"220\" height=\"328\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Missing persons posters in Juarez. Photograph: Daniel Hernandez</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cristina's case is different, however. She didn't protest against corruption or document violence, but fell victim for a rather banal reason: being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The incident that put her in a drug cartel's crosshairs was a mass shooting she escaped as one of few surviving witnesses. From a small home in New Mexico, where she now lives in hiding, Cristina reflected on that event, but noted it wasn't her first brush with violence in Juarez. That's how she began describing the night three gunmen broke through her front door.</p> <p>Personal accounts like hers, while isolated, provide shocking glimpses of the trauma and tragedy that exist for people living amidst Mexico's brutal drug war. These stories also reveal a state of lawlessness that experts say is unlikely to stop any time soon.</p> <p>As gunman entered her home, Cristina told her sons, aged eight and six, to stay calm. The men soon called for her to come out. She did, and was immediately grabbed and thrown to the floor. The men then pistol-whipped her husband, who collapsed next to her. \"They asked for money, jewelry, car keys, everything they wanted,\" she recalled. \"I said: 'I don't know what you're looking for, but you can take whatever you want. I only want my children.'\" </p> <p>One man \u2013 \"El Vato\" \u2013 hovered over her saying he would execute them all. Another gunman then said: \"What are you doing? We came for him. Don't get out of control.\"</p> <p>He said: \"Go to your kids' room, close the door, and no matter what you hear, don't leave, don't speak.\" Cristina did as told. And for the next half hour heard them beating her husband. He groaned and wept through the assault as she huddled with their sons in silence.</p> <p>After 30 minutes, when the noise finally ceased, Cristina came out to the awful realization that her husband had been kidnapped. Two hours later, her brother-in-law received a phone call with ransom instructions.</p> <p>Cristina's husband owned a small used-car dealership, and over the next two days, she and her brother-in-law hustled to sell his lot, liquidate assets, raise funds, withdraw savings. \"We did everything we could to get all the money together and paid half the ransom the first day, the other half the second day,\" she said, her voice quivering. \"The third day they were supposed to return him and they didn't. The fourth day they threw his dead body in the street.\"</p> <p>Mexican president Felipe Calderon often claims that 90% of the drug war victims are criminals. That vague sentencing of 60,000 people naturally enrages victims' families. </p> <p>Nik Steinberg, a Mexico researcher for Human Rights Watch, also disputes its validity. \"The government has not produced empirical evidence to back up this claim,\" he said. \"Instead what we have found in the overwhelming majority of killings in Mexico is that the government has not even opened a criminal investigation, let alone charged or sentenced someone.\"</p> <p>The men who killed Cristina's husband were never brought to justice. There is no way to know whether they worked for the Zetas or Sinoloa cartels, which are active in Juarez Valley. That is a strong possibility, however. According to Ben West, an analyst for geopolitical intelligence firm Stratfor, the cartels have increasingly diversified their criminal activity to include extortion, kidnapping and human trafficking, in response to losses incurred in the drug trade. <br>Ironically, this means that Mexican civilians are becoming victims of their government's success. </p> <p>West added: \"You have criminal groups taking advantage of the overall security situation and basically pulling people at gunpoint and saying give me your money. With the police all caught up in this, there is no rule of law.\"</p> <p>Cristina took a job at a Juarez nightclub after her husband's murder. She went from stay-at-home mother to single breadwinner for three overnight, and moved in with her parents so they could help.</p> <p>And for almost a year, they managed. Then the cartel violence found her again.</p> <p>On 31 March, 2011, at about 8.30pm, a group of federal police officers entered the bar telling everyone to line up against the wall. Searching for weapons, they padded men between the legs, looked up women's skirts, emptied handbags and checked bathroom stalls. That level of scrutiny was unprecedented, Cristina said. At one point an officer even began groping a colleague of hers. She intervened, saying: \"Hey \u2013 we respect you and your work, you should respect us. You can't treat us like that.\" The man backed off, but not before delivering an ominous message. \"You haven't seen anything yet,\" he said. \"The worst is yet to come.\"</p> <p>And truly, it was.</p> <p>A few minutes after the police left, two men entered the bar carrying automatic weapons. A man near entrance lunged for the doorway and they shot him. \"That was the first person to go down,\" Cristina recalled. \"I dropped to the floor. Everyone was screaming with fear.\" </p> <p>With ruthless abandon, the assassins opened fire in every direction, killing all they could, shooting everyone in sight. \"I could see people around me in pain, some people dead,\" Cristina recalled. At some point the men lit the bar on fire. A waitress next to Cristina ran as soon as they left, saying: \"I'd rather be shot to death than burn.\"</p> <p>\"When it sounded like all the shooting had stopped, and you could smell the place was starting to burn, I had to go too,\" Cristina said. She ran outside, where several cars were on fire. </p> <p>She ran to the parking lot and suddenly froze when four pairs of headlights turned on. They were four federal police trucks. They had never left. \"The only thing I thought at that moment was: Sin Madre,\" she said \u2013 a phrase that literally means \"motherless\" but is also slang for \"goddammit.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-457479541\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436786653972/Feliz-Viaje-001.jpg\" alt=\"Feliz Viaje\" width=\"460\" height=\"440\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sign wishing travellers a good trip, between Ciudad Juarez and the United States. Photograph: Daniel Hernandez</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Hernandez</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Incredibly, municipal police pulled up just then. They jumped from their cars, hurling curses at their rivals. \"They turned their attention to them,\" Cristina said, referring to the federal police, who refused to let the responding officers through. \"That's the only reason I got away.\"</p> <p>Despite serious efforts to purge corruption from their ranks, reports of Mexican law enforcement engaged in criminal activity are rampant. \"What mostly happens is police officers work by day for the city, then as a side job also do security for the cartels,\" said West, of Strator. \"And that obviously creates all sorts of conflicts of interest.\"</p> <p>\"All levels of police are implicated,\" he added. \"But what is probably most alarming is that the military is also falling into corruption. The government is running out of tools to fight this problem.\"</p> <p>Cristina showed great poise escaping the El Castillo bar massacre; she fell into a daze, however, immediately afterward. \"I was just wandering,\" she said, \"lost, till 4am when I finally got back to the house.\"</p> <p>The following day, three survivors gave statements to police about the event. Too intimidated, Cristina refused. She had no plans to talk, but that wouldn't make a difference, unfortunately. About a week later, a friend from the bar \u2013 another survivor \u2013 called Cristina to warn her that \"sicarios\" \u2013 assassins \u2013 were asking for them at nightclubs downtown. </p> <p>Cristina had no intention of going to work at a nightclub again. \"I just couldn't,\" she said. Nevertheless, they found her one afternoon driving on a highway. They drove a Dodge Ram, and tried to bully her toward the shoulder. They wore masks, her son said, and tried to run her off the road but somehow she pulled away. </p> <p>\"I'm still not sure how I managed to keep control of the car,\" she said. \"They tried to kill me with my kids.\"</p> <p>She stayed up that night thinking about what to do. \"It had gotten to the point where I was very scared, always worried that people were looking for me,\" she said. \"I was terrified for my children.\" </p> <p>\"I talked to my oldest son Raul about the possibility of coming to the US,\" she recalled. \"I thought about it all night, and then on the 13 April I took my boys and what I could pack and went to the bridge.\"</p> <p>According to the department of homeland security, 4,400 Mexican nationals have applied for US asylum in 2012. That number already exceeds the 4,000 requests filed in 2011, and is more than three times the 1,200 made in 2005, before the drug war began.</p> <p>These people represent a fraction of the displaced, of course. And only a fraction of them will see their requests granted. Over the past six years, only 11% of asylum cases from Mexican nationals were granted. And that average is trending downward. As Crystal Massey, an activist in Spector's office, explained: \"Unless you can show that you belong to a particular social group that is not the whole country right now, you don't qualify for asylum.\"</p> <p>Cristina's first hearing is this fall. With federal police implicated in the massacre she witnessed, she hopes a immigration judge will find her government complicit in her persecution. </p> <p>Her mother, sister, brother-in-law and nephews will go through asylum hearings too. They followed Cristina across the border after their own tragic run in with \"sicarios\". Gunman showed up at their door recently demanding to know Cristina's US address. Her father refused to reveal it, and for his loyalty he was taken with the promise that the rest of the family was next. </p> <p>Her father was never seen again and is assumed killed. When asked for her full name and age \u2013 \"Cristina Roman Dozal, 28\" \u2013 Cristina offered his name too: \"Manuel Roman.\"</p> <p>And it's deaths like his, and her husband's, and the ruthless killings of innocents at the El Castillo bar that cause Cristina to grow upset when confronted by the claim that 90% of Mexican drug war victims are criminals. </p> <p>\"In their crossfire they're getting innocent people. In the bar where I worked, maybe they were going after one bad person, but they killed innocent people too. And then there is more bloodshed when they pursue the witnesses,\" she said, her voice quivering. \"They go for a person, kill their mother, kill their brother. They kill lots of innocent people. They killed my father. It just keeps spreading out and it's mostly innocent people.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Introduction</h2> <p>The world of synchronised swimming is a competitive one probably best summed up by comparison with the notorious ballet film Black Swan. Endless practice, extreme flexibility, litres of waterproof mascara and a large dose of frustrated desire all have their part to play. Except that last one maybe. And you must never, NEVER let your feet touch the bottom of the pool.</p> <h2>The basics</h2> <p>Synchronised swimming, or \"synchro\" for short, is basically aquatic dance. Athletes perform complicated routines in and under the water, choreographed to music. You need to be able to swim, obviously, and ideally have the slick manoeuverability of an Arctic seal. Some experience in gymnastics or dance would be helpful, as would natural rhythm. Athletes perform in solos, duets, trios or teams, so it can be quite a sociable affair. Although at the Olympics this is one of two women-only events (the other is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/08/gymnastics-olympics-2012-get-involved\">rhythmic gymnastics</a>), as a beginner or non-Olympic competitor, men can have a go too. In fact, synchro started as a male sport in the 1800s.</p> <h2>Health benefits</h2> <p>Surprisingly vast. As well as increased muscular tone, when tested and compared with other Olympic athletes synchronised swimmers ranked second only to long-distance runners in aerobic capacity.</p> <h2>Equipment, costs and practicalities</h2> <p>If you're interested in competing, the standards are high. Athletes must train with speed swimmers in distance work, as well as working on technical skills such as the set body positions and transition movements that form the basis of synchronised swimming. For serious competitions, you must have passed the relevant skill level. Your coach will be able to tell you which level is needed for which competition. </p> <p>If you would prefer not compete then you can concentrate on recreational grades. You can find out more about grades at <a href=\"http://www.swimming.org/britishswimming/synchro/synchronised-swimming-resources-for-athletes/\">swimming.org</a>. Either way, to get access to coaches and teammates you need to join a club (there are more than you might think, all around the UK). Simply Google synchro clubs in your area. Annual membership costs around \u00a340. </p> <p>The only other things you need are a good pair of goggles (for practice only - they're not allowed in competitions unless you have a chlorine allergy), a nose clip and a swimming costume.</p> <h2>Trendiness rating: 4/10</h2> <p>It's not exactly a sport you'll want to boast about at the watercooler.</p> <h2>Inside line </h2> <p><strong>Faye Callaghan, swimming.org: </strong>\"Anyone who loves swimming, dance or gymnastics will love synchronised swimming, as it is an exciting mixture of all three. During competitions swimmers perform a combined routine of elaborate moves in the water, accompanied by music. Because the teams spend so much time together working through routines it's a great social activity that builds strong bonds between teammates.</p> <p>\"Synchronised swimmers must demonstrate advanced water skills, great strength, endurance, flexibility, grace, artistry and precise timing, as well as exceptional breath control when upside down underwater. Because of this, synchro is really hard work and so it's great for anyone who wants to tone up or lose weight.</p> <p>Synchro sessions are available for swimmers from as young as five but adults are welcome too. There is even a national master's competition [for older swimmers].\"</p> <h2>Find out more</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.swimming.org/britishswimming/synchro\">swimming.org</a> - lots of information about synchro and other aquatic sports.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.aquavision.org.uk/?gclid=CNyGmIjZ8LACFZMctAod73NBuA\">aquavision.org.uk</a> - synchro club covering north London.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.portsmouthsynchro.co.uk/\">portsmouthsynchro.co.uk</a> - Portsmouth synchro club.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bristolcentralsc.co.uk/\">bristolcentralsc.co.uk </a>- Bristol central swimming club.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.synchro.org.uk/\">synchro.org.uk</a> - Birmingham synchro club.</p> <h2>You may also like</h2> <p>Water polo, gymnastics.</p> <h2>You might hate</h2> <p>Boxing, wrestling.</p> <h2>Over to you</h2> <p>Are you a synchronised swimmer?

  "<p>In the past few years, political leaders have suffered decisive failures at advancing the sustainability agenda during their gatherings in Copenhagen, Johannesburg and Rio. Even cautiously lowered expectations have not been met. George Monbiot <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/25/rio-governments-will-not-save-planet\" title=\"\">described </a> Rio+20 as \"the&#xa0;greatest failure of collective leadership since the first world war \u2026 the end of the multilateral effort to protect the biosphere.\"</p> <p>There have been many divergent reflections on the reasons for such immense failure. However, we see signs of a new consensus about how to shape the future. The vacuum left by the absence of political leadership has generated a groundswell of support for collaborative, multi-sectoral processes focused on modest initiatives.</p> <p>Mary Robinson <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/06/26/world/americas/rio20-mary-robinson-failure/index.html?hpt=hp_c3\" title=\"\">expressed her deepest regrets</a> about the inaction of political leaders at Rio+20: \"This possibility of a once in a generation moment passed us by.\" In her view, the only way forward to a sustainable society is through civil organising.</p> <p>Peter Bakker of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/rio-20-business-sustainable-development/print\" title=\"\">reacted with a sense of anger and urgency</a>. \"I don't want self-satisfaction, which I saw at the corporate leaders forum in Rio, or people bringing me stories of CSR achievements.</p> <p>\"The truth is if you add up all the CSR programmes across the world and all the 200-plus commitments from this week, we are not nearly going to save the world.\" Bakker feels that it is past time for the best business leaders to take on the challenges, work locally across sectors and push for better reporting and more accountability.</p> <p>At a recent appearance in Oxford at Resource 2012, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18837028\" title=\"\">Bill Clinton laid the blame</a> for these political failures on the ignorance of voters. At the conference he said: \"The whole consciousness of a significant number of voters\" must be changed to allow their governments to address resource scarcity. This brings to mind Juncker's curse: \"We all know what to do, we just don't know how to get re-elected after we've done it.\" Clinton then articulated his view of a multi-sectoral strategy. For Clinton, the way forward is not more conferences with braver politicians; it lies in the ability of governments, businesses and NGOs to work together.</p> <p>Although these three leaders lay the blame for the failure of Rio+20 in different places, we see a recurrent theme in their visions of the way forward.</p> <p>First, sustainability must now be advanced through collaborations among multiple business sectors, levels of government and NGOs. Politicians no longer lead the process, but work with those who can identify issues and propose solutions. It is in the skills and methods of civil society that we can move our agenda forward, says Robinson.</p> <p>Secondly, through many small, local and achievable projects, we can make gains. Clinton identified the same kinds of projects the <a href=\"http://www.skollfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Skoll Foundation</a> and others have been developing for years: energy retrofits, solar installations, cleaner fuels. Bakker wants to see local cross-sectoral initiatives in cities.</p> <p>Thirdly, there must be measurable goals and a new mechanism for accountability. No longer is conventional CSR reporting adequate to the task. New accounting methods, as Rio's <a href=\"http://www.naturalcapitaldeclaration.org/\" title=\"\">Declaration on Natural Capital</a> begins to define, must be put in place.</p> <p>Perhaps in all these nascent strategies, we see the ghost of Nobel prizewinner <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom\" title=\"\">Elinor Ostrom</a>, who died as the conference began. On that day, <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/print/green-from-the-grassroots\" title=\"\">she published her last column</a> on sustainability. \"Setting goals can overcome inertia,\" she wrote. \"But everyone must have a stake in establishing them: countries, states, cities, organisations, companies, and people everywhere. Success will hinge on developing many overlapping policies to achieve the goals.\"</p> <p>With the collapse of intergovernmental and global processes, it is becoming increasingly apparent that we now must use new mechanisms that bring businesses and communities together. For these to succeed, we need new ways to define and measure our goals and achievements. Saving the planet is no longer the work of political leaders, but an opportunity for managers, CEOs, accountants and activists to devise collaborative solutions.</p> <p><em>Roger Martin is dean of the University of Toronto's </em><a href=\"http://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/\" title=\"\"><em>Rotman School of Management</em></a><em> and is academic director of the school's </em><a href=\"http://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/lee-chininstitute/\" title=\"\"><em>Michael Lee-Chin Family Institute for Corporate Citizenship</em></a><em>.

  "<p>It is now a year since the August 2011 riots shocked the nation. Those few days saw the worst public disturbances of a generation but just a year on, the climate feels very different. It is now hard to understand how some of England's biggest cities and their communities were left devastated by rioters.</p> <p>The aftermath brought many questions about why the riots happened and what motivated people to riot. There have been a variety of responses and heated debate over the possible causes; the shooting of Mark Duggan, social and moral breakdown, economic policy, criminality, poverty and simply wanting a new pair of trainers.</p> <p>A number of studies in the past year that have tried to make sense of the causes have told us that there was no single reason but a range of factors. LGiU wanted to learn more about what local authorities have been doing in the past year to respond to the riots and how they are working to mitigate future trouble.</p> <p><a href=\"www.lgiu.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/LGiU-Riots-one-year-on-August-2012.pdf\" title=\"\">The results of our survey</a>, which received 72 individual responses from 53 different councils, tell us that 80% of local authorities that experienced rioting last year are not expecting a repeat of the events.</p> <p>This is in stark contrast to a similar question asked by the Guardian and the London School of Economics to individuals who took part in riots last year; where 81% of those interviewed by researchers agreed that riots would happen again.</p> <p>Our results also show that 95% of all local authorities surveyed feel that if the riots were to happen again, they are prepared to respond. While it is encouraging to see that authorities are prepared, we know that any future riots would require a multi-agency response. We also need to understand if the police and other public agencies are in a similar position.</p> <p>Over the past year, councils have done a lot of work to review emergency plans and put special measures in place to deal with potential riots. Despite the significant cuts to budgets, local authorities are still prioritising this sort of work, with around half of the councils that we surveyed saying they have or are intending to review their plans.</p> <p>Of the 25% of local authorities who had not reviewed their plans (another quarter couldn't say if they were doing this), none had experienced riots in 2011. It follows that they do not feel that their areas are at risk of public disorder.</p> <p>That said, 34% of respondents who didn't have rioting in their area are still reviewing plans as a response to the riots.</p> <p>Authorities reported that they are tending to focus on making better use of social media \u2013 both to understand their communities and to communicate with them. They clearly understand the role that social media played in the riots and also the changing nature in which people are now communicating with each other.</p> <p>A significant amount of work is being targeted on understanding and monitoring cohesion issues so that authorities are able to tackle potential tensions within communities before they reach crisis point.</p> <p>Many of the reports in the aftermath of the riots looked at the role of social capital and community resilience in mitigating disturbances. Our survey showed that six in 10 councils are doing work, or have continued doing work, to build social capital and community resilience.</p> <p>The focus of this has been deprivation, community safety, youth work and engaging closely with local groups and vulnerable sections of the community.</p> <p>In the months and years ahead, local authorities will be faced with difficult decisions about where to invest resources. But this survey shows that at present, they are continuing to put resources into preventing riots by investing in work to strengthen communities and tackle factors contributing to social deprivation.</p> <p>To avoid riots in the future, this will need to continue. The challenge for local authorities will be in balancing the budgets in order to do so, and bringing communities into the delivery process, to ensure that they are an integral part of building resilience.</p> <p><em>Laura Wilkes is policy manager at the </em><a href=\"http://www.lgiu.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Local Government Information Unit</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for news, views and analysis direct to you</strong></p> <p><em> </em></p>",

  "<p>Generous, irreverent, politically incorrect, erudite, clear-sighted and very funny, with an irrepressible appetite for the good things in life, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/07/robert-hughes\" title=\"Robert Hughes obituary\">Robert Hughes</a> was also sensitive, sometimes vulnerable and always brutally honest about everything, including himself.</p> <p>Bob cheated death 13 years ago when he had a head-on collision on an isolated road in Western Australia. He had taken a day out from an arduous filming schedule to go fishing for tuna and was on his way to rejoin the crew when the accident happened. He was in hospital for six months. There is nothing quite like facing death in the land of your birth to prompt you to see the place clearly, he said at the opening of his documentary series about Australia, which he miraculously completed in time to air on BBC2 and PBS to mark the start of the Sydney Olympics in 2000. Bob's subsequent difficulty in getting about on crutches, and his using a wheelchair, is increasingly evident in the six films we made together over the next 10 years, culminating in The Mona Lisa Curse (2009), in which Bob is virtually immobile throughout the film's 75 minutes.</p> <p>Bob's opinions were always expressed with a muscular certainty, a disdain for anything fake, in words of clarity and power that will be relished by future generations. As much as Bob thrived in the visual medium of television to illuminate the visual medium of art, his skill was to remind us that great television is as much about words as it is about images. He was not a snob but he was an unapologetic elitist who believed in the value of discerning the rarely achieved good art from the more freely available bad art, and he was fearless in denouncing the mediocre and the politically correct (which Bob invariably saw as one and the same) irrespective of the critical consensus, popular opinion or the hype of the art market.</p> <p>Three memories spring to mind:</p> <p><strong>Scene 1: </strong>Bob loves food. He loves to eat it and he loves to cook it. Here he is in the very small kitchen of a friend's house in Sydney making chilli stone-crab for a large party. This is cooking as war. Bob is assaulting the crab with violent rapture. The kitchen is covered in detritus. It's a scene from a Jacobean tragedy. After Bob has finished cooking, and before he can join his guests for dinner, he excuses himself. He has to take a shower and hose himself down.</p> <p><strong>Scene 2: </strong>Bob is in his minimalist loft apartment in Soho, New York, surrounded by the book-crammed shelves he lovingly crafted himself. It is 11 September 2001, and we are making a film about Bob's great hero, Goya, to be shown on the launch night of BBC4. Through the picture windows of Bob's apartment we have a cinematic view of the Twin Towers as they erupt in flame and then collapse. Bob's TV is on the blink so, perhaps fortunately, we are spared commentary; we just watch the tragedy unfold mute. Bob response is refracted through art; he is reminded of the caption to Goya's shockingly brutal image from his classic series of prints, The Disasters of War: \"I saw this.\"</p> <p><strong>Scene 3:</strong> Bob is in hospital after the car crash. He has more pins holding him together than I can count. He is telling the story of his accident, at least the bits he remembers. It turns out that Dan, the friend who took Bob tuna fishing, hears about the crash and keeps Bob company while they wait for the emergency services. The car has been crushed beyond recognition and Bob is pinned inside. He can see liquid dripping from the engine on to the tarmac. He asks Dan to check it out and Dan breaks the bad news to Bob that the liquid is gasoline.</p> <p>Bob knows that Dan used to be a commando and asks him if he is carrying a gun. Dan says he never leaves home without it. Bob says he has a favour to ask: if the gasoline ignites, he wants Dan to shoot him. Bob doesn't want to die, but if he has to die he does not want to burn to death. Dan promises Bob he will do as he asks. Before it comes to that, the helicopter ambulance arrives. As Bob is strapped into the stretcher, Dan says, \"Bob, you're the bravest man I ever met.\" Bob replies, \"Come off it, Dan. That's bullshit.\" Dan reconsiders. \"OK, Bob. You're the bravest art critic I ever met.\"</p> <p>Bob felt that was not a bad epitaph and it still rings true.</p>",

  "<p>Are radical feminist separatists infiltrating Saudi Arabia's ruling elite? Have the women of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia undergone a wild revolution, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/30/women-gayrights\" title=\"\">read Love Your Enemy? and decided to eschew all male company</a> to create their own political systems and free themselves from the patriarchy? I hope so, because otherwise it's hard to imagine the convoluted logic behind a decision to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/12/saudi-arabia-city-women-workers?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">build all-female cities</a> to boost women's employment.</p> <p>The country already has separate schools, segregated universities (and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/may/27/saudi-arabia-university-for-women\" title=\"\">biggest all-female university in the world</a>) not to mention offices, restaurants and even <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/12fac18e-e160-11e1-839a-00144feab49a.html\" title=\"\">separate entrances for public buildings</a>. Now industrial hubs are to be built so that women can be hidden away even further than their current dresscode of abaya, headscarf and niqab allows.</p> <p>The country's segregation is so extreme the plans bring to mind the US's racial divide under the Jim Crow laws, ensuring \"separate but equal\" institutions for black and white people. And like the legalised discrimination in the US, \"equal\" in this context means no such thing. The female half of the adult population of Saudi Arabia is considered unfit to control their own lives. Women cannot decide whether to leave the house, whether or who to marry, whether to work or study, whether to travel, what to wear, or even whether to have major surgery \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/26/saudi-arabia-women-equal-rights\" title=\"\">without the consent of a male guardian</a>.</p> <p>In a country of such startling misogyny, which treats women like children, it is hardly surprising there are few women in work and that it is becoming a crises the ruling elite is being forced to take notice of. Almost <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/29/saudi-women-living-contradiction\" title=\"\">60% of the country's college graduates are women</a>, but <a href=\"http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/06/11/220016.html\" title=\"\">78% of female university graduates are apparently unemployed</a> \u2013 despite the fact more than 1,000 hold a doctorate degree. In total only 15% of Saudi Arabia's workforce are women. And unlike in many recession-hit countries, there are more than enough jobs to go around \u2013 the economy apparently booming.</p> <p>Yet with women refused driving licences for fear it will lead to social disintegration, education for girls failing to fit them for the workplace, and businesswomen still expected to have a male representative to deal with government agencies, not to mention the pressure to provide women with separate offices, employers naturally favour men. With sexism so central to the system, women are also largely restricted to traditionally female-oriented fields in the public sector and less than 1% of decision-making posts are held by Saudi women.</p> <p>With so many barriers and a climate that seems hostile to women working \u2013 or being in the public eye at all \u2013 many female employers and employees will no doubt welcome the chance to find jobs and not have to cope with the difficulties of a mixed-sex environment. The industrial cities are said to be places that will improve women's prospects and give them the chance for greater financial independence. The first is planned to open next year, and will apparently create 5,000 jobs in textiles, pharmaceuticals and food-processing industries, with four similar industrial cities being proposed in Riyadh.</p> <p>But how can further segregation be expected to solve the problems caused by discrimination? It takes a peculiar leap of logic to think the answer is instead to build whole new cities where women who choose to have careers can be herded. Would this be seen as acceptable, even progressive, if the cities were there to house workplaces for people of one race rather than one gender? But where are the voices calling for an end to the country's discriminatory practices? There has been none of the broad support that would have ensued had the segregation been along race lines. In South Africa such segregation was the basis for a worldwide boycott, yet Saudi Arabia is merely seen as an \"exceptional\" place with a different culture.</p> <p>Clerics will say that Islam does not allow women and men to mix at work, while the rulers explain that segregation is part of Saudi culture. Yet Islamic feminists have pointed out time and time again, that the prophet Muhammad himself was married to a businesswoman \u2013 with no need to hide in an all-women city. A culture that does not just segregate women, but enshrines in law that they are second-class citizens is hardly one worth preserving.</p> <p>If the cities fail, it will, no doubt, be seen as a sign women are not fit to run businesses. But if they turn out to be a success, more will be built, and women will be more segregated than ever \u2013 disappearing even further from the public sphere. So maybe the answer is for women to not just welcome the cities, but flock to them, close the doors, and refuse to leave until the kingdom's rulers understand just what it is like to live without women.</p>",
  "<p>Google is expected to accelerate the launch of its ambitious music service outside the US after the company announced last Friday that it will downgrade illicit filesharing sites in its search results.</p> <p>Websites that host unlicensed copies of songs and films <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/10/google-algorithm-hollywood-lobbyists-copyright\" title=\"\">will be relegated in Google search results from Monday</a>, in what is being seen as a major olive branch to the entertainment industry.</p> <p>The change is expected to hasten the expansion of Google Music, the search engine's rival to Apple iTunes, which was announced in November 2011 but has been unable to expand outside the US because of licensing difficulties.</p> <p>The music and film industries have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jan/26/google-bing-illegal-music\" title=\"\">complained for years about Google directing people to unlicensed material online</a>. The prominence in search results of alleged illicit filesharing websites such as Pirate Bay and MegaUpload has become a major sticking point in Google's negotiations with the music industry as it attempts to strike licensing deals to launch its own service.</p> <p>Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the British Recorded Music Industry (BPI), which represents the four major music groups in the UK, described the announcement as a breakthrough and said it would be helpful to Google's plans to launch its digital music service in the UK.</p> <p>\"This has the potential to be really significant, but it all depends how it is reflected in the results people see,\" Taylor said.</p> <p>\"It makes us feel that Google is a little bit more on our side. It's helpful background music to these [Google Music] discussions, certainly.\"</p> <p>The BPI also wants Google to give internet users more information about licensed content in search results, so that queries for an Adele or Justin Bieber song would be more likely to return recommendations for Spotify or Last.fm.</p> <p>Eddie Leviten, the head of communications at the Federation Against Copyright Theft, welcomed the announcement but said the devil was in the detail.</p> <p>He said that some in the entertainment industry will be less than pleased with Google's plans to <a href=\"http://insidesearch.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/an-update-to-our-search-algorithms.html?m=1\" title=\"\">downgrade only the websites that have received the highest number of takedown requests from music and film groups</a>. Under Google's new algorithm, if an infringing website is not subject to a copyright removal notice then it will not be relegated in search results; and every allegedly infringing URL has to be entered in a Google form, making the submission process slow and cumbersome.</p> <p>Google also submits such requests to the <a href=\"http://www.chillingeffects.org/\" title=\"\">Chilling Effects</a> website, intended to show where freedom of speech is being restricted \u2013 but also in this case pointing to sites with infringing content.</p> <p>Google says YouTube and other user-generated websites will not be negatively affected by the change. Music industry insiders say that was not anyway a significant issue because the video-sharing website offers a great marketing platform for emerging artists and already offers piracy protections, such as its <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/t/contentid/\" title=\"\">Content ID technology</a>, which identifies users who have uploaded unlawfully copied media.</p> <p>\"It's definitely a positive step but we need to see a little more about how it works,\" said Leviten.</p> <p>Industry experts said the move was strategically linked to Google's plans to take on iTunes outside the US.</p> <p>\"This is a great political step forward for Google, said Mark Mulligan, a music industry analyst. \"There is no doubt that what Google is doing is strategically linked to what they want to do with their own music service.\"</p> <p>Mulligan said that forcing Google to demote pirate websites had been a top priority of the entertainment industry for the past 12 months, but the search giant had not previously shown signs of making any concessions.</p> <p>\"Google has a quite strident negotiation position,\" he said, adding that the move will smooth the way for Google to launch the most innovative next-generation music service in the market.</p>",

  "<p>For the most part, it's illegal to sell your body in Britain. But, in fact, there are various legal ways human body parts can be sold that don't involve waking up in a bath of ice with a kidney missing. In a research experiment, I tried to see <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/whats-my-body-worth\" title=\"\">how much of the human body can lawfully be put up for sale</a>: by trying to sell as much of my own body as I could. It turns out pretty much everything God gave us can be sold.</p> <p>Why would I do this? Body parts are sold on the black market because there's often a genuine medical need. This year, 1,000 people in the UK will die on the organ transplant list. Couples unable to conceive wait years for donations of egg or sperm. Some doctors argue that a legal market for life-giving body parts should to be created in order to increase donations. But there are enormous ethical concerns and so far the government has refused to allow any kind of financial incentive for donors, apart from allowing some expenses. I investigated whether the law is hindering a legitimate market, firstly looking at what's already on sale here in Britain \u2013 and whether the price is reasonable.</p> <p>Sex is the most obvious thing to sell. While I wasn't prepared to prostitute myself, I \"rented\" my body out as a lapdancer. Working at a London strip joint, I found that pole dances are given away for free, but nude lapdances start at \u00a320. The sales pitch to prospective dancers is that you can earn \u00a31,000 a night \u2013 but it turns out this kind of money is a rarity. Lapdancers only make such amounts if get a customer to hire them by the hour. For that you earn \u00a3500 \u2013 but the club takes 20%. On top of that, they'll take a \u00a3100 fee from dancers just for showing up.</p> <p>So I tried to sell my hair. I was quoted \u00a350 by a hairdresser in London that specialises in harvesting human hair to make wigs for chemotherapy patients. I was hoping they'd offer me considerably more, given that wigs can sell for \u00a31,000.</p> <p>The British pharmaceutical industry uses many bodily fluids to test new drugs, and I was hopeful for a decent sale upon learning they pay up to \u00a31,750 for 1ml of blister fluid, \u00a31,000 for a cup of saliva and \u00a31,600 for a gram of earwax. But the prices are paid to intermediaries, \"virtual tissuebanks\" who source samples from around the world. Strictly speaking, the money isn't for the tissue itself, it's for refrigeration, licence fees and research, but given companies are for-profit I was sure some money should go to donors. The best offer I got was \u00a330 for some blood. Another clinic would have paid me \u00a350 for some skin \u2013 if I had psoriasis. However, every clinic told me that officially money is only \"compensation for my time\" because the law in the UK is so strict about selling any body parts. In Britain, it's not donors who are making the money.</p> <p>A decent earner turned out to be an auction website for people who buy bodily fluids for sexual purposes: imagine eBay, but for fetishists. Here, one can sell anything. Human urine is about \u00a330 a pot, breast milk \u00a35, even fingernails and faeces do their own roaring trade. One man offered me \u00a31,000 a year for manicure videos.</p> <p>It's paradoxical that it's possible to sell one's body for a variety of \"specialised\" purposes, and yet it's virtually impossible to do so for legitimate reasons, such as for medical research. Many in the pharmaceutical industry are hugely critical of the Human Tissue Act which governs what's permissible to sell for medical purposes. They say it's unfeasible for companies to recruit donors in Britain, and so they're forced to import tissue from overseas, notably American biobank repositories.</p> <p>My most valuable sale item was eggs. In the UK, they only allow donors \u00a3750 compensation, which means almost no donors come forward \u2013 and many desperate prospective parents are driven overseas to buy eggs. But in the US, thousands of women sell eggs \u2013 it's a mainstream market.</p> <p>One egg broker agreed to fly me to California for retrieval. It's a fiercely competitive industry, egg-selling, and only the best-looking and most intelligent women get top dollar \u2013 up to $15,000. Unfortunately, because I'm 32 years old, I was told my eggs aren't worth much and I'd \"only\" receive $5,500. As I was handed a giant box of hormones with which to inject myself, I came to a belated realisation that perhaps the price wasn't worth it. It's troubling that the trade targets very young women, many of whom don't think through the psychological implications of doing this.</p> <p>The greatest irony of all, is that my body is undoubtedly worth more dead than alive. In America, once a cadaver has been disarticulated into about 60 different tissues, the body parts are processed and made into medical products, which together are worth up to $250,000 on the open market. Some companies are listed on major stock exchanges \u2013 this is no niche market.</p> <p>So by the end of my experiment, I saw some dizzying prices, but didn't end up with much in my wallet. While it's ridiculous that people who are willing to donate bodily fluids as harmless as urine and saliva for crucial medical cannot be paid, I did end up coming around to the old-fashioned idea that altruism must drive any decision to donate. Women who donate eggs, or those who choose to give away a kidney must not be coerced by money to meet their bills. I don't know the answer to the UK's terrible shortage in eggs or kidneys, but I do know that the answer is not in writing a giant cheque.</p> <p>\u2022 Storm Theunissen's documentary film, <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/whats-my-body-worth\" title=\"\">What's My Body Worth?</a>, is on More4 at 10pm, tonight, Monday 13 August</p>",

The decision came after months of political wrangling which came to a head in June when two boats carrying refugees <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/21/boat-capsizes-christmas-island\" title=\"\">capsized north of Christmas Island</a> within a week of each other, killing at least 90 people.</p> <p>Gillard, like the centre-right opposition Liberal party, argued that refugees should be processed offshore, but the two main parties disagreed about the location. The Labor party wanted to send asylum seekers to Malaysia as part of a swap deal in which Australia would resettle bona fide refugees. But without a majority in parliament \u2013 and lacking the support of the Greens (who hold the balance of power and oppose offshore processing), Gillard was unable to get the required legislation through parliament.</p> <p>On Monday Gillard said her government had accepted the recommendations of the expert panel convened six weeks ago to find a political solution. \"What this report is calling on parliamentarians to do is to compromise and to act. This report is telling us not to stay in our fixed positions but to act and get things done,\" she said. \"When our nation looks at what is happening at sea, too many lives have been lost.\"</p> <p>The announcement drew immediate condemnation from human rights groups. Pamela Curr, of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, described the report as \"a comprehensive package of harm\".</p> <p>\"People will still drown. What this [report] is making sure is that people drown elsewhere and don't drown right in front of us,\" she said.</p> <p>More than 600 refugees have drowned in the past three years. The panel recommended refugees be sent to Nauru and Manus Island for processing to deter others considering undertaking the dangerous voyage to Australia. \"We recommend a policy approach that is hard-headed but not hard-hearted. That is realistic not idealistic. That is driven by a sense of humanity as well as fairness,\" said the panel's chair, Angus Houston, a former air chief marshal.</p> <p>The panel recommended that the changes to asylum policy should be part of a comprehensive regional framework that could later include Malaysia, provided safeguards and accountability measures governing the agreement with Kuala Lumpur could be strengthened.</p> <p>It said that the government should apply the principle of \"no advantage\" to ensure that no benefit was gained through \"circumventing regular migration arrangements\". Gillard said: \"You need to equalise treatment for asylum seekers so you don't get a better deal if you get on a boat.\"</p> <p>The panel also recommended increasing Australia's humanitarian intake from 13,750 a year to 20,000, rising to 27,000 over five years, as an incentive for refugees to apply through regular immigration channels. Turning back asylum boats to where they came from was not a safe option at the moment, it said.</p> <p>Human rights groups said the recommendations were in breach of Australia's international legal obligations.</p> <p>\"Penalising people based on their mode of arrival is clearly in breach of [Australia's] obligations,\" Graham Thom, of Amnesty International, told ABC television. \"We are only talking about people who come by boat, we're not talking about the thousands of people who come by plane and seek asylum in this country. What we are doing is penalising one particular group and actually taking them to a very remote place where we know they've been damaged in the past and holding them hostage to stop other people from coming.\"</p> <p>Pamela Curr, of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, described the report as \"a comprehensive package of harm\".</p> <p>\"People will still drown. What this [report] is making sure is that people drown elsewhere and don't drown right in front of us,\" she said.</p> <p>The UNHCR said it would need to study in more detail the proposals for offshore processing in Nauru and Papua New Guinea. \"The efficacy and integrity of such proposals will need to be assessed against their ability to deliver effective protection outcomes to refugees identified as needing protection under international law, not least through the 1951 refugee convention to which Australia is a party,\" it said in a statement.</p> <p>The Liberal opposition spokesman on immigration, Scott Morrison, said the panel's findings amounted to an endorsement of his party's policies and gave the government \"the opportunity to fix the mess they've made\" by resuming the previous Conservative government's policy of offshore processing.</p> <p>Former Liberal prime minister John Howard set up detention centres on Manus Island and in Nauru. Manus Island was closed in 2004, while former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd shut down the Nauru detention centre soon after he won power in late 2007.</p> <p>The Greens welcomed the recommendation of increasing the number of humanitarian places, but condemned offshore processing. \"This is about a policy that strips out legal protections in Australian law,\" said the party's leader, Christine Milne. The Greens would not be party to something that was \"cruel to people\" and \"sets up a chain of detention centres right across the Pacific\", she said.</p> <p>This month 650 refugees have been picked up trying to reach Australia by boat. The annual number of arrivals by boat represents about 2% of Australia's total migration.</p>",
  "<p>John Cage. A wolf in sheep's clothing. Not my aphorism, but the epithet of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/tomserviceblog/2012/jul/23/michael-finnissy-contemporary-music-guide\">Michael Finnissy</a>, a composer who <a href=\"http://www.eno.org/see-whats-on/productions/production-page.php?itemid=2007\">worked with Cage</a> and who deeply admires him, but who suggests that the Cageian legacy is something that needs deconstruction as well as celebration. Behind that <a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7A_3GIRoiWc/T-LAYq14V4I/AAAAAAAABE4/5xK9ysp-SdY/s1600/john%2Bcage.jpeg\">beatifically smiling visage</a>, the charming prophet of (apparent) freedom, egolessness and openness, there could lurk a more conventionally controlling figure, a creative spirit just as fiercely rigorous and as conscious of his own significance as any of the other titans of the 20th century.</p> <p>What's worth remembering and genuinely celebrating in Cage's centenary year (yes, he \u2013 just! \u2013 fits in with the inclusionary criteria for this series) is that Arnold Schoenberg was out of order when he described Cage not as a composer, but \"an inventor \u2013 of genius\". (In one of those dazzling quirky chances of musical history, Schoenberg taught Cage in Los Angeles in the 1930s.) It's a common misconception about Cage - that it's his ideas instead of his music that matter. </p> <p>It's easy to be seduced by that line of thinking. After all, what is his (in)famous silent piece, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HypmW4Yd7SY\">4'33''</a>, if not a masterstroke of conceptual fullness and pre-determined sonic emptiness rather than a piece of music in any sense that the term had been understood before David Tudor sat down at that piano in 1952 and didn't make a sound for exactly <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/No-Such-Thing-Silence-America/dp/0300136994/ref=sr_1_sc_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344843633&amp;sr=8-2-spell\">4 minutes and 33 seconds</a>? You could make similar arguments for his development of his <a href=\"http://www.e-flux.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/wpid-1256244409image_web_full.jpg\">beautiful graphic scores</a>, abstract images for musical interpretation rather than conventional notes; his use of the Chinese Book of Changes, the <a href=\"http://www.ichingonline.net/index.php\">I Ching</a>, so that his compositional process was governed by chance operations rather than the workings of his ego; even the <a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Wum-REXnGoY/TWflq34GY_I/AAAAAAAAohY/ifbdrxGcrIw/s1600/john+cage+2.jpg\">prepared piano </a>he created in the late 1930s as an all-in-one percussion and piano section, by sticking nails and bits of rubber into the strings of an otherwise normal piano: great concepts, all of them, that opened gates of perception to new kinds of thinking about music. \"Happy new ears\", as Cage himself put it.</p> <p>But that's to forget about something really rather important: Cage's music. Concepts are fine, but if you haven't got the chops to back them up with pieces of music that performers want to play and audiences want to hear, you're going to have a narrow influence as a composer. Cage was a bona fide, proper, real, composer. Here's none other than <a href=\"http://www.thestoolpigeon.co.uk/features/letter-woody-guthrie-x-john-cage.html\">Woody Guthrie</a>'s reaction to hearing a record of the prepared piano solos from Cage's Amores in 1947. (Thanks to composer <a href=\"http://larrygoves.com/\">Larry Goves</a> for making me aware of this.)</p> <p>'I've been around at several dance gatherings and musical houseparties here in New York city where I heard John Cage overhaul the family piano in his own way and play some of his choked down off and unusual kinds of things. I've hear him work with [a] roomful of tomtommers and drummers on first one stage and then the other one, and not only did I feel that this sort of piano music was really a keen fresh breeze, but a welcome thing in the way of a healthy change from the old ways you hear the average piano played\u2026 I think that John Cage and Alan Hovaness [sic; Hovhaness's music was also on the same disc] have caught and handed over to us a whole forest and desert mountain full of these fine things that would be looked down on or looked over in bashful weakness by ninety nine out of a hundred raters in every window.\"</p> <p>Guthrie caught the thrill of the new that Cage's prepared piano music still makes you feel, and the new musical terrain it opens up. The structural rigour but sonic richness of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fPSz-o4zzY\">Sonatas and Interludes</a> are some of the most immediately attractive music of this last century; I'd say the same about Cage's magical, austere <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4zW6rgMHqQ\">String Quartet in Four Parts</a>. </p> <p>But what about the lupine elements of the Cage legacy? Just before 4'33'', Cage completed the four volumes of his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOwcpjr9wFA\">Music of Changes</a>, another piece for <a href=\"http://davidtudor.org/\">David Tudor</a>. Produced painstakingly through the chance operations of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching\">I Ching</a>, Cage laboured hard to find a way to erase his control as much as possible in the compositional process: what could be less egotistic, less about the whole composer-as-hero idea, than not determining a single sound in a piece you supposedly \"write\"? And yet the result is similar, in its relentless virtuosity, its employment of the extremes of the keyboard, its unpredictable changes of speed and dynamic, to some of the most systematised music ever conceived. Boulez's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIo15gWMheA\">Structures 1A</a>, composed at roughly the same time on the other side of the Atlantic, Music of Changes was also, in fact, rigorously determined by the questions Cage was asking of the I Ching. Music of Changes is heroically difficult to perform, and gives the pianist no leeway in its realisation. Nothing, in other words, is really left to chance at all in a performance of Music of Changes.</p> <p>Forward-wind a quarter of a century, and Cage again wrote a sequence of some of the most coruscatingly complex music of his career, the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JohydSPuNkY\">Etudes Australes</a> for solo piano. Have a listen and look at the score here (thanks, again, to the panoply of contemporary music that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/John11inch\">John11inch's YouTube channel</a> provides): the notes \u2013 found through a combination of star charts and the I Ching - are fixed, but their rhythm and volume is left to the performer. What Cage wanted was that whoever plays the piece creates their own system to interpret the notation - this isn't an excuse for improvisational indulgence. That's just as true for the works of earlier decades of Cage's career, such as the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE6n2VBo2cM\">Concert for Piano and Orchestra</a>, a masterpiece of gorgeous graphic notation, but again, a template for the creation of a strict system of interpretation rather than a licence to play the first thing that comes into your head. </p> <p>In fact, Cage's music is some of the most severe and exacting to play you can imagine. The discipline required to perform the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8PdWgl2fWs\">subtly shifting soundworlds</a> of the later pieces that are titled after the number of performers involved (from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_Pieces\">One to 108</a>) isn't just about following a stopwatch and making sure you're playing your notes at the correct temporal point, but submitting yourself to a kind of listening, a sensitivity of musical interaction between you and the other performers that requires you to give up your sense of individual identity to Cage's music.</p> <p>In other words: the piece is still paramount in Cage's music. For all the existential freedoms he opened up for generations of musicians who came after him, that central idea of the work being more important than the composer, the performer, or even the audience, is one he never completely turned over. Even worse, from his own theoretically ego-less position, the veneration of the canon of his pieces is something of a philosophical problem: we still \u2013 and I've done this too! \u2013 talk about 'Cage's 4'33''', when, in reality, the lesson of that piece is that it's ours, that simply by turning our aural attention completely to any sonic phenomenon, we all create our own continual loop of 4'33''s. It isn't Cage's, any more than the sounds you're listening to as you're reading this are his. </p> <p>Does that, then, make Cage a big musical wolf? Perhaps: but while you're pondering that question, get down with John Cage the great composer \u2013 and Cage the musical oracle, whose riddles are just as resonant today as they were in the 1950s. Happy ever-new ears, you might say. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SSulycqZH-U?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SSulycqZH-U\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SSulycqZH-U\">Reading on mobile?

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/universal-pictures\" title=\"\">Universal</a> was clever to keep the Bourne name in the title of the fourth instalment in the franchise. After Matt Damon's Jason Bourne took a dive into the East River and swam off at the end of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/119889/bourne.ultimatum\" title=\"\">The Bourne Ultimatum</a>, audiences who caught <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147726/bourne-legacy\" title=\"\">The Bourne Legacy</a> at the weekend could have been forgiven for anticipating another serving of Damon leaping across rooftops and talking into his sleeve.</p> <p>But Damon is no longer the star of the show; he made it clear several years ago that he would not return unless Paul Greengrass were to direct another episode \u2013 and that looked increasingly unlikely as time wore on. However, the essence of Bourne hangs over this excellent new story director by franchise screenwriter <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006904/\" title=\"\">Tony Gilroy</a>, who has taken a more expansive look at the spy world created by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2001/mar/14/guardianobituaries.books\" title=\"\">Robert Ludlum</a>.</p> <p>The new protagonist Aaron Cross, like Bourne, is also the product of a shadowy spy project and \u2013 here's the killer \u2013 he's portrayed by one of the most exciting actors on the rise today. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/aug/11/bourne-legacy-jeremy-renner\" title=\"\">Jeremy Renner</a> is no spring chicken at 41 but ever since his stunning performance in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/130570/hurt-locker\" title=\"\">The Hurt Locker</a>, he's been gathering momentum on the fringes. He played second fiddle to a reinvigorated Tom Cruise in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145386/mission\" title=\"\">Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol</a> and played Hawkeye in this year's smash <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/144027/avengers\" title=\"\">Avengers Assemble</a>, even if it seemed like the part was bolted on after canny lobbying by his agent. The effect of both roles has been to allow Renner to percolate into the collective psyche. As a result I reckon most moviegoers heading in to The Bourne Legacy will have had a hunch who he was but wouldn't have been able to put a name to the face. After watching this movie they will.</p> <p>The $40.3m (\u00a326m) opening weekend may be the second lowest in the franchise precisely because of the unfamiliarity factor, but strong word of mouth will allow The Bourne Legacy to stick around in the coming weeks. It won't reach the $227m scored by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/119889/bourne.ultimatum\" title=\"\">Ultimatum</a> (2007) or the $176m posted by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/101541/bourne.supremacy\" title=\"\">Supremacy</a> (2004), but episode four does indeed represent a new hope and should have the chops to overtake the $122m final gross of Identity, the first in the series back in 2002.</p> <p>It's a tricky thing to change direction in the middle of a franchise but kudos to Universal for having the guts to go with an actor who is not yet a household name. The one-shot in the US advertising materials was smartly done. Renner stands gun in hand as an overlay of black and grey horizontal panels partly obscures his face and torso. The title stacks up in the bottom left of the image, strong enough to stand out and remind audiences of the franchise. The effect is that, at a glance, you might think it's Damon in the picture. Closer inspection reveals the identity of the new actor and this goes hand-in-hand with the tagline: There was never just one. It's skillfully done and understated, rather like the tone of the franchise.</p> <p>Casting Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis in a comedy about rival political contenders sounds like timely stuff in this election year and by many accounts <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1790886/\" title=\"\">The Campaign</a> is pretty funny. The Warner Bros comedy opened in second place on a highly creditable $27.4m. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a> was dethroned after four weeks but it's done well and sits on the cusp of $400m in the US and $850m worldwide.</p> <p>Far more interesting is how <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1535438/\" title=\"\">Hope Springs</a> will play out. Sony's \"dramedy\" reunites Meryl Streep with David Frankel, who directed her in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/113237/devil.wears.prada\" title=\"\">The Devil Wears Prada</a>. Streep and Tommy Lee Jones tread carefully as a sexless couple who undergo marriage counselling. Steve Carell is the sympathetic relationship guru.</p> <p>Hope Springs has grossed $20m after five days, which isn't half bad considering the subject matter. It would appear to be a pet project for studio head Amy Pascal given the lack of easy sell, so it's hard to predict which way it will go. The under-50s will have little to do with it, so all eyes will be on the older demographic. The movie arrives with awards potential and in a season that upon first glance might not be as strong for women as last year: Streep \u2013 the Eternal Contender (and current best lead actress Oscar holder for The Iron Lady) \u2013 could be back in contention again.</p> <p><strong>North American top 10, 10-12 Aug 2012</strong></p> <p><strong>1</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147726/bourne-legacy\" title=\"\">The Bourne Legacy</a>, $40.3m</p> <p><strong>2</strong> The Campaign, $27.4m</p> <p><strong>3</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a>, $19.5m.

Work has finished successfully on the first, \u00a3170,000, phase of a <a href=\"http://www.forestry.gov.uk/\">Forestry Commission</a> project to restore one of England's most fragile and threatened areas of bog and mire on the <a href=\"http://www.northyorkmoors.org.uk/\">North York Moors</a>.</p> <p>As you can see from the main photograph, the site is in the lee of the <a href=\"http://www.raf.mod.uk/raffylingdales/\">Fylingdales</a> early warning base, whose looming pyramid replaced the more delicate trio of domes which Sir Nikolaus Pevsner described in his <em>Buildings of England </em>as:</p> <blockquote> <p>Three perfect white globes of great size on three perfect black plinths in the grandiose, undulating silence of the moor. The geometry of the space age at its most alluring and most frightening.</p> </blockquote> <p>The bog is <a href=\"http://www.wildlifeextra.com/go/uk/langdale-forest.html#cr\">May Moss</a>, part of Langdale forest, and it is reckoned to date back nearly 9000 years in its watery, muddy state. That was at risk because of conifers planted after the Second World War to restore UK timber resources which had been depleted by military demands.</p> <p>At the rate of \u00a31 a tree, in terms of a grant from the <a href=\"http://www.sitatrust.org.uk/\">SITA trust</a>, 170,000 of these have now been removed, with additional help from the North York Moors national park. Prolonged extraction of moisture through their roots has already eased with noticeable effect. Plants such as sphagnum moss and bog rosemary are starting to flourish again, along with dragonflies and many other less striking but ecologically valuable insects.<br>&#xa0;<br>Brian Hicks, an ecologist with the Forestry Commission says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have restored 150 hectares of the bog, twice as much as originally planned, by removing trees and blocking drainage channels to help the site retain rain water. The signs are encouraging with the return of vegetation to areas cleared of trees.&#xa0; Despite appearances this is a living habitat with about a metre of new peat being laid down every 1,000 years.&#xa0; Bogs may not have the profile of rainforests or ancient woods, but ecologically they are just as important.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394646390\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/13/1344856990901/Mulcher1.jpg\" alt=\"May Moss\" width=\"460\" height=\"279\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scrunch!

Addressing the campaigners, environmental scientist <a href=\"http://www.eggconsult.co.uk/business-model-affiliation/staff-affiliates/aidan-foley-ba-msc-phd/\">Dr Aidan Foley</a> made the same point which Hicks is making over on the North York Moors:</p> <blockquote> <p>I think one of the most important things for people to realise is not only that they can do something about this problem to improve the management of the catchment, the solution to the problem is very simple. It involves filling in the drains on the moors and alllowing them to revegetate. Filling them in lifts the water table, which means that there's greater storage much higher up the catchment. That changes the vegetation again to what it should be, that is sphagnum moss-based. And that's simple and straightforward.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>But potentially expensive.

The dominant narrative among the senior higher education establishment is that all is more or less well with the world \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/aug/09/tuition-fees-increase-15000-less-applicants\" title=\"\">applications are down overall</a> but the system as a whole is still over-subscribed. So secure are universities in their confidence that students are prepared to pay higher fees that many, <a href=\"http://www.offa.org.uk/press-releases/offa-announces-decisions-on-2013-14-access-agreements/\" title=\"\">it was revealed by the Office for Fair Access</a>, have put up their fees for 2013.</p> <p>As far as domestic recruitment is concerned, then, the bigger picture is one of stability. But the establishment would do well to take a look at the system from the other end and the perspective of the hundreds of thousands of individuals who are getting their exam results this week and hoping to go to university.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/jul/23/university-clearing-crisis-aab-offers\" title=\"\">Last month I warned</a> that one of the consequences of the AAB free-for-all in places would be a longer and more turbulent clearing process than in recent years, and particularly painful for those students holding university offers at AAB or equivalent who fail to achieve their expected grades.</p> <p>Having written in fairly strong terms of a crisis in clearing, I was braced for a bit of a backlash and accusations of scare-mongering. The reverse has been the case. It seems the potential for problems in this year's clearing has been insider knowledge for some time among admissions professionals. My concern is that many vice-chancellors and senior communications professionals may not have been warned of the danger and there has been a certain amount of last minute scrambling to address this omission.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.wonkhe.com/2012/07/30/gearing-up-for-clearing/\" title=\"\">Writing for Wonkhe</a>, Andrew Fisher reports that UCAS recently contacted vice-chancellors to alert them of the potential fate of many students who have missed predicted AAB grades this summer: \"Many institutions have set their offer at AAB this year, even those who would not normally expect to recruit at that level. This means many students will be holding both a main and insurance offer at AAB, because all the offers they got were AAB. The institutions will admit many students who miss this AAB offer, but will do so where it makes sense for them, based on their other applicants. This may take a while, and result in some highly-qualified students finding themselves in clearing whilst they wait to find out what their insurance institution will do\".</p> <p>Let's hope this warning reached them before they'd all departed for their holidays.</p> <p>Universities and higher education institutions need to be seen to be taking action to respond to the confusion and anxiety of applicants who find themselves in a clearing limbo. I asked UCAS for a comment regarding the circular sent to VCs and was rewarded with a couple of rather dry paragraphs. This will give you the gist: \"The student number control arrangements are one part of this year's changes to higher education and have been covered in our communications. We will be supporting applicants by providing information on our website, our contact centre, and social media throughout clearing...\". Let's hope that UCAS can manage to sympathise a little better if thousands of students are left in limbo this week.</p> <p>There are signs that the representative organisation for the UK's universities, <a href=\"http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/Pages/Default.aspx\" title=\"\">Universities UK</a>, at least, is beginning to wake up to the need to change the message. Its policy expert on admissions, Fiona Waye, <a href=\"http://blog.universitiesuk.ac.uk/2012/08/02/universityadmissions/\" title=\"\">blogged her advice</a> for students who have narrowly missed AAB offers but still want to attend the university of their choice. The extension of off-quota places to those with ABB or equivalent may give them an opportunity to negotiate for a place for 2013.</p> <p>\"If an applicant is thinking about re-applying next year the government has set no limits on the number of applicants universities can admit with grades at ABB+ or equivalent,\" wrote Waye. \"If an applicant obtains ABB+ and is unsuccessful this year but offered a deferred place they may wish to consider whether to take this or whether to find another course through clearing.\"</p> <p>It is vitally important for university leaders to abandon the 'calm down dear' narrative on admissions and show a proper sensitivity to the pain and stress that will be experienced by many individuals who have missed AAB grades in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Steve McArdle, head of sixth form at Durham Johnston School, who leads on university admissions for the <a href=\"http://www.ascl.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Association of School and College Leaders</a>, has been warning for months about the danger of clearing turbulence this summer. McArdle has been struck by the failure of senior university staff, and in particular policy makers, to see the detail. \"All the policy makers seemed to care about was their beautiful theoretical model and allowing the market to decide,\" he told me. \"They apparently simply hadn't realised or factored in the impact that it was bound to have on thousands of real human beings\".</p> <p>In January 1979, the Labour prime minister James Callaghan returned to a frozen and strike-bound UK from a summit in sunny Guadeloupe. Faced with a wall of reporters at Heathrow, he breezily spoke of swimming in the Caribbean sea before asserting, \"I don't think that other people in the world would share the view that there is mounting chaos.\"</p> <p>The following day the Sun newspaper summed up his complacency with the headline, \"Crisis? What Crisis?\" Five months later Margaret Thatcher won the general election. The British public doesn't take kindly to leaders who return from holiday to tell them to calm down.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

If they are, you're either a beer technologist or developing an especially unhealthy obsession with 50 Shades of Grey.</p> <p>Love and grit are not the only things driving the ever-expanding variety of beers that we're <a href=\"http://www.brewersguardian.com/brewing-features/british/british_craft_brewing_increase.html\">currently able to enjoy</a>, and neither is it all about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/jun/24/american-craft-beer-hippest-hops\">hop-toting American hipsters</a> shaking up the <a href=\"http://gbbf.org.uk/pictures\">Great British Beer Festival</a>. Deep in the corridors of <a href=\"http://www.cara-online.com/\">Cara Technology</a>'s research labs in Leatherhead, southern England, a handful of microbiologists and flavour technicians hold both the past and the future of beer drinking in their hands.<br><br>Their lab contains hundreds of beer yeast strains, some dating back 130 years. All are cryogenically frozen in tiny vials within a dustbin-sized metal vat. Liquid nitrogen keeps the temperature inside the vat at a cool -190C, so my guide, Ali, is wearing thick gloves and I've been told to stand still.</p> <p>Whether you fancy resurrecting a pre-revolutionary Russian brew, are a<br>fan of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/29/flavoured-beers-popularity-food-pairing\">new-wave fruity fizz</a> or fancy something <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/jun/14/lower-alcohol-beer-taste-test\">lower in alcohol yet still flavoursome</a>, there's a yeast strain in the frosted treasure trove that can probably help.</p> <p>Brewers are notoriously protective of their yeast, but it's an unruly so-and-so. Despite being used to turn fermentable sugars into alcohol for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b012wcl6\">thousands of years</a>, nobody really brought yeast to heel until Louis Pasteur's seminal <em><a href=\"http://www.beerbooks.com/cgi/ps4.cgi?action=enter&amp;thispage=1299&amp;order_id=!ORDERID!\">Studies on Fermentation</a></em> in the late 19th century.</p> <p>Pasteur's work lit the way to commercial production of pure yeast strains. Soon after, Emil Hansen, a chemist working for Carlsberg, managed to isolate the strain of yeast that gave birth to modern lager and, in an act of benevolence rare in the industry, the company <a href=\"http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/04/beer-history-discovery-of-yeast.html\">made it freely available</a> to the brewing world. Perhaps you think that's little to shout about, but the breakthrough allowed a previously unimaginable degree of control over the brewing process.</p> <p>Today's beer boffins have tamed enough yeast strains and processes to affect almost any flavour you'd want in beer, from the <a href=\"http://beer.about.com/od/ale/p/IPAProfile.htm\">citrus notes of a pale ale</a> to the caramel, <a href=\"http://www.ratebeer.com/beerstyles/amber-ale/53/\">nutty aromas of an amber ale</a> or the clove-like tones of a <a href=\"http://www.germanbeerguide.co.uk/hefeweiz.html\">classic German wheat beer</a>.</p> <p>Cara's crack team have developed all manner of new flavour reference points. \"These things didn't exist, and we've been able to go to a company like Cara and say we're looking for these particular things that consumers are describing,\" says Simon Wade, head of brewing strategy at SABMiller (which arranged for me to visit the lab). \"It's about understanding flavour at the molecular level.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394681695\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/13/1344854898511/Beer-tasting-at-Cara-Tech-004.jpg\" alt=\"Beer tasting at Cara Technology yeast bank\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beer tasting at Cara Technology - a world away from a cosy pub.

If your beer smells \"<a href=\"http://www.aroxa.com/indole/\">like pigs on a farm</a>\", for example, the chances are that your yeast is churning out too much dimethyl sulphide during fermentation.</p> <p>So, while scientific understanding paved the way for the commercialisation of yeast cultures and led in turn to identikit \"any time anywhere\" lager brands, the balance is now swinging firmly back towards innovation and diversity.

  "<p>There was never a guarantee that it would amount to anything for us.

Think again. The \u00a39bn figure that we have seen is just the largest part of a complicated set of arrangements involving public and private finance.</p> <p>We thought it would be a good idea to gather all that data together in one place - to provide a definitive guide to this Olympic's funding.</p> <p>We've pulled together data published by the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA), the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) - and what we know of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (Locog) to piece together a detailed picture of funding and spending.</p> <p>The difference between Locog and the ODA is, as a Locog spokeswoman put it to me: \"the ODA is building the theatre; we put on the show\". The ODA has spent \u00a36.248bn of public money on getting the grounds and venues ready, with another \u00a32.537bn coming spent via other bodies such as local authorities and direct from the DCMS itself. Locog has budgeted the smallest amount: \u00a32bn.</p> <p>So, how did we get here? We have identified spending of around \u00a311bn - which is essentially the government's \u00a39bn plus Locog's published budget of \u00a32bn. Locog will not publish any details until after the games themselves, so we have divided up its funding using what we know, which is that Locog is paying for half the budget for ceremonies, half the budget for the paralympics and, obviously, the cost of running the events themselves.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/datablog/2012/jul/26/london-2012-olympics-money\">Read more</a></p> <h2>8.

In 1908, at the height of the British empire, it was a last-minute choice, stepping in for Rome after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. In 1948, Germany and Japan were banned following their wartime defeat, the Soviet Union was absent and this was the 'austerity Olympics' in a broke country. So, how does 2012 compare?</p> <p>The House of Commons Library, the team which usually supplies MPs with the answers to tricky research questions, is publishing the ultimate statistical guide to how Britain, London and the Olympic games themselves have changed. Olympic Britain, out today, charts how the world the Olympians of 1908 knew would seem unrecogniseable today. And how we got there.</p> <p>In 1908, the first modern Olympics of 1896 were still a live memory, and this was quite a different world. The majority of the competitors came from the imperial empires of Britain, Russia, Germany, the Austro-Hungarians and France, plus the new power: America. The five rings of the Olympic symbol weren't invented until Baron Pierre De Coubertin presented it to the world in 1914.</p> <p>Although the colonies were allowed to participate, it was hardly encouraged for fear it would lead to national identity and undermine their European masters. Two indigenous Africans from South Africa had been allowed to compete in the St Louis games of 1904, featuring in 'athletic games for savages', although they were allowed to enter the marathon, finishing ninth and twelfth out of 36. It wasn't until 1952 that any other sub Saharan country participated, Ghana, although it didn't win a medal until Clement Quartey won a boxing silver in 1960.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/datablog/2012/jul/10/london-olympic-charts-medals-competitors\">Read more</a></p> <h2>11.

It's more than just reporting results.</p> <p>And, as the games developed, the big questions of the day became around how to interpret the stream of numbers emanating from Stratford's Olympic Park and venues around the region. It became less about using other people's data and generating our own. </p> <p>As soon as the 8,000 runners started carrying the Olympic torch around the country, data journalists started working at breaking down the numbers behind the news.

The 25% of places outside of public nomination campaigns were allocated through internal processes at commercial partners, the International Olympic Committee, sporting bodies, direct invitation from Locog, and the relay's sponsors - one of whom allocated 15% of its 1,360 places for its own staff. Some data on places is still missing.</p> <p>The fact that this information was closed and required a major investigative effort reflects a lot of what we know about the Olympics: the stuff you really want to know isn't necessarily the information that's open and published freely. It's much more likely to be hidden right around the corner. </p> <p>And if data journalism is about anything, it's about turning that corner and telling that story.</p> <h2>More data</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data\">More data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian</a></p> <h2>World government data</h2> <p></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world-government-data\">Search the world's government data with our gateway</a></p> <h2>Development and aid data</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store/global-development-data/search?q=\">Search the world's global development data with our gateway</a></p> <h2>Can you do something with this data?</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong>Flickr</strong> Please post your visualisations and mash-ups on our <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1115946@N24/\">Flickr group</a><br>\u2022&#xa0;Contact us at <a href=\"mailto:data@guardian.co.uk\">data@guardian.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/page/2009/jun/17/1\">Get the A-Z of data</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store\">More at the Datastore directory</a></strong><br><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://twitter.com/guardiandata\">Follow us on Twitter</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Guardian-data/155291341187950\">Like us on Facebook</a></strong></p>",

The multi-talented Kirby has created an outrageous cast of connected characters peppered with comic foibles. When a prehistoric panther, a winged beast and a Biblical invasion of flies 'pick off the townspeople as prey,' the curse that plagues the town threatens to destroy it. Oh, and there's also a great, white beached shark that makes Jaws seem like a minnow.\"</p> <p>It sounds like a metaphor for this very prize.</p> <p>Olwen Acts says Stephen May's Life! Death!

He's also meant to be the guardian of his little brother Oscar. It's a truly hair-raising roller coaster ride that leaves you feeling somehow empty when you finish.\"</p> <p>That too sounds like a description of the Not the Booker.</p> <p>Fortunately, Ewan Morrison's Tales from the Mall doesn't. Instead it could, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17599885\" title=\"\">claims robotmaster</a>, be \"the first novel for the Culture of Metrics.

  "<p>Vietnam will donate 5,000 tonnes of rice to North Korea after recent flooding, which has left crops devastated, more than 160 people dead and 212,200 homeless, according to state media.</p> <p>The donation may help assuage fears of a widespread famine like the one that killed an estimated 1 million in the 1990s. But UN officials warned on Thursday that the full crop damage and food scarcity facing North Korea won't be known until an assessment is completed next month.</p> <p>More than 65,000 hectares of farmland have been washed away since floods began in late June, following a severe drought. Around 5,000 houses, 300 public buildings and 60 factories have been destroyed by the floods, renewing concerns about Pyongyang's capacity to feed its people and to carry out damage control. UN agencies said in June that two-thirds of the country's 24 million population were facing chronic food shortages.</p> <p>North Korea is prone to flooding as much of its mountainous terrain has been deforested to grow crops on terraces. This creates landslides in heavy rains, says Leeds University Korea analyst Aidan Foster-Carter. \"North Korea is incredibly vulnerable to natural disasters because of their natural environment and what they've done to it over the years,\" he says. \"Before the country was divided in 1945, the south was the rice bowl \u2026 [Now] North Korea is about 1m tonnes short of food every year.\"</p> <p>Vietnam vowed to make the donation at a meeting on Monday in Hanoi between the Vietnamese president, Truong Tan Sang, and North Korea's visiting head of state, Kim Yong-nam. The two leaders promised to foster the \"traditional friendship\" between the nations and promote further economic co-operation, particularly in agriculture, Vietnam's state newspaper Nhan Dan reported.</p> <p>Rice is the largest source of calories for most Asians and is the continent's most important crop, but <a href=\"http://www.adb.org/features/12-things-know-2012-rice\" title=\"\">consumption is rapidly declining</a> due to rising incomes and resulting lifestyle changes, according to the Asian Development Bank. The world's two main rice producers, Vietnam and Thailand, are <a href=\"http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/306543/rice-scheme-is-pro-rich\" title=\"\">facing their own crop crises of sorts</a> as both are engaged in <a href=\"http://vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn/Economy/228544/farmers-lose-out-on-rice-deal.html\" title=\"\">costly and questionable rice schemes</a>. Claudia von Roehl, the UN World Food Programme's representative in North Korea, says the nation is \"quite far away\" from a repeat of the 1990s famine, but warns that the overall health of the population is of concern.</p> <p>\"We should always be aware there is a very chronic and severe problem in the nutrition of the population, and, in particular, the very monotonous diet, which is basically composed of maize and rice \u2013 carbohydrates \u2013 and lacking very significantly in proteins and fats,\" she said.</p> <p>The WFP is providing emergency food assistance \u2013 in the form of 400g of maize \u2013 to about 102,000 people in 23 flood-affected counties. Fear of disease has spread after it was discovered that drinking wells had been contaminated by overflowing latrines. Pumping stations and water sources were also contaminated or damaged by the floods, according to the UN.</p> <p>The UN will complete a full food assessment in late September, looking at the impact of the floods and drought on the main harvest. UN agencies hope that the assessment will give them a greater idea of the new leadership of Kim Jong-un, who took over after his father's death in December, as the assessment will include meetings with North Korea's ministry of agriculture. Analysts believe economic reform \u2013 including a revised look at food security \u2013 could be on the cards, but no one knows how radical it might be or when it might happen.</p>",
  "<p>Many applauded the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19111720\" title=\"\">firm response</a> to last summer's riots that saw an unprecedented influx into England's <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/YoungPeople/CrimeAndJustice/CrimeAndTheLaw/DG_10027708\" title=\"\">youth custody system</a>. Fewer may have wondered how the new arrivals fared. In fact, according to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/dec/20/rioters-jailed-faced-attacks-inmates\" title=\"\">chief inspector of prisons</a>, some were subjected to attacks by fellow inmates and some embraced gang culture themselves for the first time; at one youth jail, the number of new prisoners on suicide watch trebled.</p> <p>This may come as little surprise to those who've seen <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148534/offender\" title=\"\">Offender</a>. Violence, suicide, bullying, drug-taking, bent screws and rioting are rife in the establishment in which it's set. Understandably, incarceration therein does nothing to divert Tommy, the film's once worthy young hero, from the wayward course on which he's embarked.</p> <p>Filmgoers may wonder whether things are really this bad in such places, and if so why. Some may be happy with the idea of locking up irredeemable old lags and throwing away the key, but the young are different. Surely, for our sake as well as theirs, we ought to be doing our damnedest to reclaim them. The money we spend on keeping a young offender in a secure unit for a year could <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2008/dec/17/addiction-youth-crime\" title=\"\">send him to Eton for six</a>. So what's going wrong?</p> <p><a href=\"http://paulproducer.com/\" title=\"\">Paul van Carter</a>, the writer and producer of Offender, relied on research conducted with the help of a 21-year-old friend who'd done time in <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/contacts/prison-finder/feltham\" title=\"\">Feltham</a>; former Feltham inmates were also <a href=\"http://www.heyuguys.co.uk/2012/04/04/offender-interview-with-director-ron-scalpello-and-writerproducer-paul-van-carter/\" title=\"\">around on set</a>. Nonetheless, things are perhaps just a little less grim in the real world than they appear in his film. Van Carter says he was inspired by Alan Clarke's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/36325/scum\" title=\"\">Scum</a>, but since that appeared in 1979, the system it depicted has long been swept away.</p> <p>Scum portrayed the <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Bl6Tk5ysFQwC&amp;pg=PA397&amp;lpg=PA397&amp;dq=Borstal+custody&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2EaFDLM8PP&amp;sig=eHLGZoOeHoSUGA_12CeqWI1ZOaw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LA8gUJepOqWX0QXCqoHADw&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwCDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Borstal%20custody&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">Borstal</a> regime, which was rooted in 19th-century boarding school practice and relied on military-style discipline.

You might not realise it from the film, but inmates in these establishments are promised up to <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/YoungPeople/CrimeAndJustice/CrimeAndTheLaw/DG_10027708\" title=\"\">25 hours a week</a> of education, skilling and other such activities, including programmes designed to improve their behaviour.</p> <p>Last year's government-commissioned study<a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/crime/tackling-knife-crime-together/tackling-knife-crime-report?view=Binary\" title=\"\"> Tackling Knife Crime Together</a> reported: \"Many young offenders said they actually became accustomed to life in a young offenders' institution, with some describing it as 'a holiday camp' \u2013 three hot meals a day, a place to stay, ways of being educated or earning a wage (no matter how small it may be), and quite often the opportunity to make friends or hang around with people they already know.\"</p> <p>Still, all is far from entirely well. Last year, there were <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/feb/14/youth-custody-failing-young-people-want-change\" title=\"\">3,500 incidents of violence</a> in youth custody establishments and another 1,500 instances of self-harming. Young people in custody are <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18166236\" title=\"\">10 times as likely</a> as adults to get involved in a fight or serious assault. In 2009 <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/bullying-rife-at-young-offenders-institution-1767356.html\" title=\"\">an official report</a> found bullying at a YOI in Rochester to be so serious that victims hid in their cells and refused to come out, even to eat. Last year, just one YOI in Aylesbury experienced <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/inside-the-uks-toughest-youth-prison-799120\" title=\"\">173 incidents of violence</a> and 187 incidents of self-harm among a mere 400 inmates.</p> <p>Young offender institutions aren't equipped to tackle what are often complex social and mental health needs. Inmates who say they want to go straight complain that the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uservoice.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2012%2F07%2FUSE1650_User_Voice_report_16.07_3.pdf\" title=\"\">educational opportunities are inadequate</a>. Others use their sojourn to enhance criminal skills and contacts. The outcome of all this is that <a href=\"http://www.howardleague.org/moj-statistical-breakdown/\" title=\"\">70%</a> of those leaving youth custody reoffend within a year.</p> <p>Is there a better way? Reformers demand <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2006/may/08/youthjustice.prisons\" title=\"\">alternatives to custody</a> for the young. However, the number held in secure establishments has already been <a href=\"http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/children-custody-five-year-low\" title=\"\">sharply reduced</a>. Doubtless there will always be a need for some to be held behind bars. What to do with them is a problem of long standing.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwebarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk%2F20120119200607%2Fhttp%3A%2Fwww.justice.gov.uk%2Fconsultations%2Fdocs%2Fbreaking-the-cycle.pdf\" title=\"\">green paper</a> published in 2010, the coalition government proposed replacing youth custody with \"the Young Offenders Academy\", which would bring to bear community resources and concentrate the efforts of education, mental health and family services to promote personal development. This may sound a far cry from what we see in Offender, but the approach implied isn't quite as novel as it may sound.</p> <p>It was philanthropists intent on rehabilitation who first proposed special establishments for young criminals early in the 19th century. Unfortunately, they fell foul of the principle of \"<a href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/history/poorlaw/eligible.html\" title=\"\">less eligibility</a>\", which asserted that transgressors must always be treated worse than their law-abiding counterparts lest, in the words of Dickens, \"the dishonest felon\" should \"in respect of cleanliness, order, diet and accommodation\" end up \"better provided for and taken care of than the honest pauper,\" thereby discouraging rectitude.</p> <p>The first state-run institution for erring juveniles, set up in 1838 at <a href=\"http://www.blacksheepancestors.com/uk/parkhurst_page.shtml\" title=\"\">Parkhurst</a> on the Isle of Wight, was therefore required to combine reform with deterrence. Its regime recognised the need for \"moral, religious and industrial training\" but insisted that \"the means adopted for this purpose should not be of such a nature as to counteract the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crimeandjustice.org.uk%2Fopus1865%2FPSJ_September_2011_No._197.pdf\" title=\"\">wholesome restraints of corrective discipline</a>.\"</p> <p>Parkhurst failed to square this circle, and so have <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=smjRfTXcTV0C&amp;dq=Reformatory+Schools+for+the+Children+of+the+Perishing+and+Dangerous+Classes,+and+for+Juvenile+Offenders&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Reformatory%20Schools%20for%20the%20Children%20of%20the%20Perishing%20and%20Dangerous%20Classes%2C%20and%20for%20Juvenile%20Offenders&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">various successor systems</a>. At intervals, reformers like <a href=\"http://www.insidetime.org/articleview.asp?a=876&amp;c=kenneth_clarkes_green_paper_sentencing_and_rehabilitation\" title=\"\">Kenneth Clarke</a> make their voices heard, only for events like the shooting of<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/28/newsid_3393000/3393807.stm\" title=\"\"> PC Sidney Miles</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/bulger\" title=\"\">killing of James Bulger</a> to shut them up, as young delinquents revert in the public mind from unfortunates into monsters.

Even better was a week's bed and breakfast at the Hotel Galaxy in Thassos in Greece for \u00a3434pp (two sharing) with flights from Manchester on the 19th.

A simple but comfortable townhouse in Cascais, Portugal was available on 20 August for a week from \u00a3152pp when fully occupied (six people).

  "<p>It is one of the sunniest days of the year in Oldham and the Baptist chapel is packed as the weekly <a href=\"http://www.oldhambaptist.org.uk/about/about.shtml?/about/Welcome_project.htm\">Oldham Unity Destitution Project</a> gets going. In the kitchen older local women and two, young, brightly-dressed Muslim girls are serving hot food and drinks. In the main hall people from many different countries are sitting at tables enjoying the food and, of course, cups of tea. In the creche the children are playing, whilst their parents are selecting from the tables of food that stretch across three of the walls. </p> <p>The Olham Unity Destitution Project started after the street violence in the town nine years ago as a befriending project, since when it has expanded to provide a vital service for the growing destitute community in the Oldham area. Every week without fail it gives a food parcel worth \u00a36.50 to at least 50 destitute refugees. This consists of basics such as rice, lentils and tins of tomatoes. </p> <p>Stewart Bailey, secretary of the group, tells me that the project responds to a humanitarian need:</p> <blockquote> <p>Destitution affects people who have fled conflict in countries including Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and Palestine, to mention just a few. Many are traumatised and have to prove their refugee status. They often fail due to personal factors such as trauma and a lack of easy proof, as well as not being able to access legal support. Whilst in this process the government supports them with housing and a small amount of money. But once they are deemed not to be eligible as refugees, they have all their housing and money withdrawn and become destitute. Even if they want to appeal, it is difficult because of the changes in legal aid to get solicitors to take up the case, while dedicated services such as Oldham Law Centre have now closed.</p> </blockquote> <p>Even for people who decide that they are prepared to go back to their home country, things are not straightforward as Stewart explains:</p> <blockquote> <p>These people can apply for Section 4 funding which will provide financial support whilst they are waiting to return home. But not everyone is accepted and some countries such as Iran will not accept them back anyway.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Red Cross attend the project each week and check people's eligibility for destitution support. They are able to give limited financial help for the first year. After that the project, which is not a charity, has to meet its own costs, raised by regular appeals.</p> <p>The centre is run entirely by volunteers. As Stewart says:</p> <blockquote> <p>People get involved because of their philosophical or political views. We range from Marxists to Methodists. Many local faith groups provide support, including the Baptist church who provide a city centre venue. Other churches provide weekly food collections while the Pakistani community provide storage for our food.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>On the day I was there,during Ramadan, Islamic charities had provided bags of food including fresh meat, a rare treat for the recipients as the project has no cold storage facilities.</p> <p>The centre has built up good local links with NHS services. Local medical and dental practices will register people and accept the Baptist chapel as an address. Many of the refugees come from war-torn countries and need counselling and so the project refers them to the Freedom from Torture service. </p> <p>One of the people using the project when I visited was Ali, a young Kurdish man who had fled Iran due to his political activity. He told me his story:</p> <blockquote> <p>I came from Iran nine months ago and applied for asylum. They rejected my claim and now I have no housing or money. I come to the project for food and clothes. In Iran I was a football player and I want to get back into this. </p> </blockquote> <p><br>Mike Luft, one of the volunteers, has been helping Ali to link up with local team <a href=\"http://www.fc-utd.co.uk\">FC United</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>They have been very positive in supporting some of our young men. It's not just about giving them food and clothing, its about helping them to join the society we are all part of. </p> </blockquote> <p><br>Mike and his wife Heather provided practical support by taking Ali to the sports training ground so that he can join the weekly training group.</p> <p>Robin Pye, who co-ordinates the community and education work at FC United, explains their work with asylum seekers and refugees. </p> <blockquote> <p>FC United want to benefit the community we serve so we provide support to groups that have differing needs, including unemployed young men as well as asylum seekers. We recognise their particular problems of loneliness and extreme poverty.We offer sports training as a way for them to integrate into life in Manchester. Football has an international language and can help these young people by getting them involved in the sport and making friends.</p> </blockquote> <p>Stewart says that the project is:</p> <blockquote> <p>Community cohesion at its best. We work from the basis that these people are homeless and hungry, and ask the question; what can we do about it? </p> </blockquote> <p><br><em>The project is happy to accept donations of food, clothes and money, please contact stewartbailey1943@hotmail.co.uk </em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394636359\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/4/27/1335515878833/Bernadette-Hyland-001.jpg\" alt=\"Bernadette Hyland\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernadette Hyland Photograph: Bernadette Hyland</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernadette Hyland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br><em>Bernadette Hyland is a <a href=\"http://lipsticksocialist.wordpress.com/\">freelance writer and blogger.</a> She is active in her trade union, <a href=\"http://www.unitetheunion.org/\">Unite </a>, and volunteers at the <a href=\"http://www.wcml.org.uk/\">Working Class Movement Library</a> in Salford.</em></p>",
  "<p>Every now and again the rhetoric of patriarchal power reveals itself in a way that \u2013 were it not so pernicious \u2013 one would almost call poetic.</p> <p>Last week in Moscow, Madonna lent her voice to the growing international condemnation of the trial of members of the feminist performance art group, Pussy Riot. During a concert she stripped off her shirt to reveal the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2012/aug/08/madonna-pussy-riot-moscow-video\" title=\"\">group's name emblazoned on her back</a>, before donning a version of their trademark balaclava for a slow rendition of Like A Virgin.</p> <p>How, we wondered, would the Russian authorities respond to this brazen act of feminist solidarity? For the deputy prime minister, Dmitry Rogozin, the answer was obvious. On Wednesday night <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/09/pussy-riot-madonna-called-moralising-slut\" title=\"\">on Twitter</a>, he as good as called the queen of pop a whore. Madonna's benediction \u2013 as it were \u2013 of Pussy Riot was beautifully apt. The charge of \"hooliganism\" against three members of the group relates to the performance last February of a \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grEBLskpDWQ\" title=\"\">punk prayer</a>\" in which they exhorted the Virgin Mary to \"<a href=\"http://freepussyriot.org/content/lyrics-songs-pussy-riot\" title=\"\">put Putin away</a>\".</p> <p>In a recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/jul/29/pussy-riot-russia-interview-video\" title=\"\">Guardian interview</a>, a member of the group still in hiding explained that \"the main concept was to appeal to the Virgin\", to ask her to \"protect the political system\" because \"the Virgin is the protector of Russia\". While superficially an act of naive superstition, one suspects the women were not really banking on their leader being summarily swept away by divine intercession. Just like Madonna before them, the insolent political power of their gesture came from self-consciously reclaiming that great emblem of patriarchal oppression. They wanted the Virgin to abandon the patriarchs, switch sides, and \"become a feminist\". They wanted her pussy to riot.</p> <p>Against this background Rogozin's dismissal of Madonna-as-whore almost reads as inadvertent irony. The subtext is nothing if not glaring. In the patriarchal playbook, a woman's moral virtue is synonymous with \u2026 well, her virtue. Good women are chaste and pure. And the others \u2013 those who express their sexuality in ways not sanctioned by church and state, those who are sexual at all \u2013 are quite simply not to be trusted. They seduce and entrap. They're dirty and diseased. And, above all, they are deceitful and duplicitous. If they want to moralise, they should, as Rogozin told us in his second tweet, put their pants back on. And if they refuse, nothing they say is to be taken seriously or believed by anyone. A simple sexual slur, and, as if by magic, a woman's word is instantly devalued, divested of authority and discredited.</p> <p>From the comfort of a purportedly post-feminist Britain, it's tempting to view Rogozin's slut-shaming as the reflexive twitchings of a tyrannical dinosaur. Certainly, Pussy Riot's shout out to the Madonna \u2013 and Madonna's equally high-profile response \u2013 have exposed a political regime that seems miles away from our own. But perhaps we should not slip so easily into self-satisfaction about dastardly oppression in the onetime land of the gulag. In everyday English, it is not uncommon to encounter the word \"whore\" in the company of the word \"lying\". And, while our liberties clearly outstrip those of Russia's citizens, many women's lives in the \"free\" world are still marred by the lexicon of sexual slurs used by Rogozin. By the intention to control our bodies, and our political and sexual expression, by mobilising the logic of faithful virgins and feckless whores.</p> <p>One doesn't have to cast about much in our recent history to find some notable examples. One thinks of Rush Limbaugh's characterisation of the birth-control activist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/mar/02/rush-limbaugh-sandra-fluke-slander\" title=\"\">Sandra Fluke as a \"slut\"</a>, coming at a moment when American women are facing an unprecedented assault on their reproductive freedoms. Or the censuring of Michigan Rep Lisa Brown for daring to trash the \"decorum\" of the state legislature by mentioning women's ladybits in public. In both these cases, as with Madonna and Pussy Riot, the credibility of a woman's voice \u2013 and in particular, her resistance to patriarchal domination \u2013 was undermined not on the basis of her arguments or opinions, but because she either expressed herself sexually, or talked publicly about sex or sexual organs.</p> <p>Perhaps the most sobering example of the damage done to women by consistently conjoining female sexuality with inherent untrustworthiness is our abject failure to successfully prosecute the crime of rape. The rape conviction rate is not the desultory 6% we often hear quoted, the fact remains that, according to some estimates, <a href=\"http://notazerosumgame.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/slutwalk-bristol-speech.html\" title=\"\">less than 2% of rapes committed in the UK result in a conviction</a>.</p> <p>The reasons for this are undoubtedly complex, but the prevalence of \"rape myths\" \u2013 most notably that women lie about rape, and that promiscuous, or merely sexually active women make unreliable witnesses \u2013 prejudices the attitudes of jurors, the CPS and the police, and discourages women from thinking it possible for them to believed. The tenor of our jurisprudence on rape was famously set by Lord Chief Justice Hale in the 17th century, whose \"cautionary instruction\" that \"rape \u2026 is an accusation easily to be made and hard to be proved\" was routinely issued to jurors until the 1980s. And in this supposedly more enlightened age, the successful prosecution of rape is still often mired in suspicions about women's credibility, or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/06/how-my-rapist-walked-free\" title=\"\">scuppered by victim's anxieties</a> that they will be \"judged \u2026 as promiscuous and unreliable\".</p> <p>Our continued toleration of this paltry figment of justice takes place, notably, at a time when the denizens of the men's rights movement (MRM) consider our society to be in the grip of a pandemic of false rape accusations. A site called register-her.com has created a \"community resource\" to register false accusers and put an end to an ill \"more corrosive to civil society than any other violent crime\". And, just in case you're not quite feeling the WTF?, let me spell it out \u2013 the tsunami of \"corrosive violent crime\" in question is not the 94,000 rapes committed in this country every year.</p> <p>The MRM which sees every woman who accuses a man of rape as a liar undoubtedly represents the extreme end of a certain set of assumptions about women, their sexuality and their testimonial credibility. But their noxious rhetoric is not operating in a cultural vacuum. Any women \u2013 be it the mighty Madonna or an unknown adolescent assaulted by her partner \u2013 must, if she wants to stand against male sexual and political power, first steel herself against an immemorial question; will the fact that I have had sex mean I will not be believed?</p>",

They have been appointed as advisers to Morsi.</p> <p>The president also cancelled the complementary constitutional declaration issued by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (Scaf), announced days before he was declared the victor in June's elections. The addendum had curbed presidential power and kept much of it in the hands of the military council.</p> <p>\"This sets up an inevitable showdown with the supreme constitutional court as the court is likely to attempt to overturn Morsi's cancelling of the supplemental constitutional declaration. It seems this move will require the sacking of the court if it is to stand,\" said Michael Hanna, a fellow at the Century Foundation, a US thinktank.</p> <p>The decisions follow an attack by unidentified assailants on a police station in North Sinai that resulted in the death of 16 policemen on 6 August. The incident triggered further clashes between security forces and militants in the peninsula and led to the Egyptian chief of intelligence, Mourad Mowafi, being removed, along with other senior security figures.</p> <p>Morsi's move on Sunday marks the latest blow in a tussle between the Muslim Brotherhood and the military over control of post-transitional Egypt. The decision to remove Tantawi and Anan was taken in consultation with Scaf, including Tantawi, the new deputy minister of defence, Mohamed el-Assar, told Reuters.</p> <p>Replacing Tantawi is the head of military intelligence, Abdel-Fatah el-Sissi \u2013 one of the generals who defended the use of \"virginity tests\" against female protesters in March 2011 \u2013 with El-Assar as his deputy. The new chief of staff is General Sidqi Sobhi Sayed. The appointments are all members of Scaf.</p> <p>Tantawi and Anan were honoured with accolades, Tantawi receiving the highest medal in the country, the Order of the Nile, and Anan also receiving a medal, which has led to speculation that rather than indicating a face-off, this latest move comes as part of the \"safe exit scenario\" that would see Scaf members leave office without fear of prosecution for crimes committed against protesters during their tenure, including when army APCs ran over Coptic Christian protesters on 9 October 2011, killing 27.</p> <p>\"What is happening now was planned once Scaf realised they had to make a deal with the Brotherhood anyway,\" said Sherif Azer, deputy director of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights. \"This moment where Scaf would fade back into the background was expected, and I believe that they knew this was their best option for a safe exit, just fade away from the political realm.\"</p> <p>Revolutionaries who participated in the ousting of the former president, Hosni Mubarak, in 2011 have remained opposed to the military throughout the transitional period, and have criticised the Muslim Brotherhood for what they see as the party's willingness to forgo the revolution in return for political gain. Gigi Ibrahim, a member of the Revolutionary Socialists group, said: \"Morsi and Scaf joined forces in the face of the revolution to simply crush and control Egypt.\"</p> <p>With these latest decisions, and the continued absence of an elected parliament, legislative powers revert from Scaf to Morsi. The president also decreed that fresh parliamentary elections would take place 60 days after a new constitution is ratified in a popular referendum.</p> <p>A constituent assembly was formed to draft the constitution and, if the current assembly fails to come up with a draft, Morsi now has the power to appoint a new assembly to draft Egypt's future constitution.</p> <p>The president also appointed senior judge Mahmoud Mekki as his vice-president. Mekki was a senior figure in the independent judges movement during the Mubarak era that agitated for more judicial independence. Morsi had promised that his two first appointments would be Coptic Christian and female vice-presidents.</p>",

It is, is it not, a double-edged coin?</p>",
  "<p>A panel of experts set up to advise the Australian government how to deal with refugees who arrive by boat has recommended they be processed offshore in a third country, prompting condemnation from legal and human rights groups.</p> <p>The panel recommended refugees be sent to the Pacific island of Nauru and to Papua New Guinea's Manus Island for processing as a disincentive to others considering undertaking the dangerous voyage to Australia.</p> <p>\"We recommend a policy approach that is hard-headed but not hard-hearted. That is realistic not idealistic. That is driven by a sense of humanity as well as fairness,\" said the panel's chair, retired Air Chief Marshall Angus Houston.</p> <p>The panel recommended that the changes to asylum policy be part of a \"comprehensive regional framework\", which could later include Malaysia, provided that safeguards and accountability measures governing the current agreement with Kuala Lumpur could be strengthened.</p> <p>The panel also recommended increasing Australia's humanitarian intake from 13,750 a year to 20,000 (rising to 27,000 over five years), as an incentive for refugees to apply through regular immigration channels.</p> <p>Turning back asylum boats to where they came from was not a safe option at the moment, it said.</p> <p>Human rights groups have condemned the recommendations as being in breach of Australia's obligations under the refugee convention.</p> <p>\"Penalising people based on their mode of arrival is clearly in breach of our obligations,\" Graham Thom, of Amnesty International, told ABC television.</p> <p>\"We are only talking about people who come by boat, we're not talking about the thousands of people who come by plane and seek asylum in this country. What we are doing is penalising one particular group and actually taking them to a very remote place where we know they've been damaged in the past and holding them hostage to stop other people from coming,\" he said.</p> <p>Pamela Curr, of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, described the report as \"a comprehensive package of harm\".</p> <p>\"People will still drown. What this [report] is making sure is that people drown elsewhere and don't drown right in front of us,\" she said.</p> <p>The Labor party caucus is reviewing the recommendations but the conservative opposition party welcomed the panel's findings, saying they endorsed its long-standing policy. The opposition spokesman on immigration, Scott Morrison, said the panel's report gave the government \"the opportunity to fix the mess they've created\" by resuming the previous conservative government's policy of offshore processing.</p> <p>The Greens, who hold the balance of power in parliament, welcomed the recommendation of increasing the number of humanitarian places for refugees, but condemned offshore processing.</p> <p>\"This is about a policy that strips out legal protections in Australian law,\" said the party's leader, Christine Milne. She said the Greens would not be party to something that was \"cruel to people\" and \"sets up a chain of detention centres right across the Pacific\".</p> <p>The panel was set up six weeks ago after parliament failed to reach agreement on the offshore processing of refugees (the policy of both major parties) following the sinking of two refugee boats in a week between Indonesia and Australia's Christmas Island.</p> <p>Six hundred and fifty refugees trying to reach Australia by boat have been picked up this month. Over the past three years, 600 others have died at sea.</p>",

They chose the north because of our warm welcome and outstanding facilities. Sheffield, Scunthorpe and Gateshead's <a href=\"http://thesagegateshead.org/\">Sage</a> all played host to the <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/about-us/cultural-olympiad/\">Cultural Olympiad</a>, and a large contingent of the 70,000 pink-uniformed <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/spectators/games-maker/\">Games Maker </a>volunteers who made the Olympics happen came from the north. </p> <p>Above all, the north \u2013 and Yorkshire in particular \u2013 has provided the athletes and coaches who powered Team GB to Olympic glory. Sheffield's Jessica Ennis, Ingleby Barwick's Kat Copeland, and the Brownlee brothers from Leeds, to name just a few. We can also claim honorary northerner (Salford-based) Sir Chris Hoy. They, and many others, all put the north<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/datablog/2012/aug/06/team-gb-medal-winners-background#county\"> above traditional Olympic titans</a> such as Australia and Russia in the medals table; they really did put the north on the global stage. <br> What's even more uplifting is that the ambition, passion and energy that took Ennis &amp; Co. to the top of the podium were already bountiful in their home towns. Visit Leeds, York, Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield or Newcastle and you'll find self-confident cities bustling with ambitious young professionals, new shops, rising investment and growing infrastructure. </p> <p>Just last month, \u00a3560m of new rail spending<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/jul/16/manchester-greater-manchester\"> was injected</a> into the Northern Hub, John Lewis has signed up as anchor tenant for the long-awaited <a href=\"http://www.eastgateleeds.co.uk/\">Harewood development </a>in Leeds, and the North East's businesses have won over \u00a3120 million worth of Games-related business. No wonder then that Kevin Grady, Chair of Leeds Civic Trust<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/aug/07/leeds-yorkshire-olympics-brownlee-john-lewis\"> says his city</a> is having its \"best couple of months for several years\". The image of the north painted by Parry's 'dark satanic mills' - which hasn't been true for a long time - has gone forever. The north is a vibrant, dynamic network of towns, cities and communities, full of life and colour. <br> But we can't be complacent. We must still work hard to ensure that the Olympic legacy benefits the north's poorest communities too, not just our city centres and leafy suburbs. The Olympic legacy will mean nothing if it doesn't reach our inner-cities and our neediest kids \u2013 our future Olympians. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.magicbreakfast.com/\">Magic Breakfast</a> is the UK's leading school breakfast club charity and we run 45 school breakfast clubs in the north (and over 200 nationally), focused on inner-city Sheffield, Rotherham, Bradford, Leeds, Blackburn, Manchester and Liverpool. We feed hundreds of hungry children every morning in the north (and 6,000 kids nationally) with no government funding, relying on the generosity and support of individual givers and businesses like Leeds-based Bagel Nash who supply us with high-energy bagels. </p> <p>We want the Olympics to inspire our kids to lead healthy, sporty lifestyles, but we also want the north's successful businesses, Olympians and local policymakers to work with us to solve the problem of child hunger and poverty for good. The lasting Olympic legacy must be that the north's poorest communities and hungriest children have the opportunity of a better future. </p> <p>Let's hope too that the northern Games Makers bring back the passion they showed at the Olympic Park and use their talents and energy to help us build a strong Olympic legacy in northern communities: starting new businesses, volunteering for good causes, and working with charities like ours to take on the engrained social challenges like poverty that hold back our young people. Ambitious quangos such as <a href=\"http://www.yorkshire-gold.com/\">Yorkshire Gold</a> have been set up to ensure the region benefits economically and culturally from London2012. Community charities like Magic Breakfast are working hard to ensure that we benefit socially too.<br> We were treated to a fantastic Olympic closing ceremony on Sunday, showcasing all that's best about Britain: our musical heritage and creative industries; our armed forces; our athletes; and our volunteers who've come from every corner of the land. Like Danny Boyle's inspirational <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/28/london-2012-boyle-olympics-opening-ceremony\">opening ceremony</a>, it was a wonderful celebration of all we've achieved as a nation. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394630633\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/12/1344794437923/AlanMak.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Mak\" width=\"140\" height=\"150\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Let's also make the end of these fantastic Olympics the start of Britain's long-lasting Olympic legacy, which sees us build a fairer, stronger, more equal country where every young person has opportunity, with the north at the heart of that new nation. These Olympics have been a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/05/london-2012-torchbearer-readers-diary?newsfeed=true\">win for London </a>and Britain.

These two words could hardly be applied to Santos's predecessor, hardliner Alvaro Uribe, many of whose <a href=\"http://www.abcolombia.org.uk/subpage.asp?subid=427&amp;mainid=75\" title=\"\">closest family and advisers have been linked to the murderous narco-paramilitary groups</a>.</p> <p>When I asked Santos a couple of months ago why Uribe <a href=\"http://www.caracol.com.co/noticias/actualidad/video-muestra-enojo-y-arremetida-de-uribe-contra-santos-via-twitter/20120519/nota/1691027.aspx\" title=\"\">keeps savaging him on Twitter</a> despite the fact that their signature policies seem so similar, his answer was revealing: \"I often ask myself the same question.\" From his economic and social policies \u2013 attract foreign skills and investment to expand natural resource exports to pay for social investments: the classic neoliberal package \u2013 to his attitude to the guerrillas, which he <a href=\"http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/paz/articulo-350574-mas-plomo-contra-farc-santos\" title=\"\">recently summarised as \"more lead\"</a>, he seems to be following where Uribe led. That is certainly how it looks to many of his critics on the left.</p> <p>But his drive to be modern and decent has imbued these policies with a subtle rebalancing. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-18882551\" title=\"\">Recent pictures of indigenous people removing armed soldiers from their land</a> surprised the country \u2013 Uribe tweeted that this was a breakdown of law and order. But for some it demonstrated the difference between the two men. Where Uribe would probably have ordered the troops to fight back, Santos accepted a limited humiliation of the armed forces in the name of decency. I remember hearing the first radio announcements by the Santos government endorsing the importance of human rights defenders and thinking: \"Santos is going to be different.\" Uribe never lost an opportunity to harangue and undermine those working on human rights, often <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2009/02/05/letter-president-uribe-recent-statements-about-journalist-hollman-morris\" title=\"\">accusing them of complicity with terrorism</a>. Perhaps most blatantly, the diplomatic attitude Santos shows towards the Venezuelan president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, despite his certainty that Ch\u00e1vez funded the Farc guerrillas, must deeply annoy Uribistas, demonstrating as it does a mature diplomatic approach to international politics.</p> <p>Lest this article be mistaken for a hagiography, let me make clear that everything is relative and that politics is often the art of the least-worst option. Santos still cares more about mining profits than the land rights of indigenous people and poor communities, and there is no sign whatsoever that the fundamentals that make Colombia one of the world's most unequal countries are being challenged \u2013 Santos's <a href=\"http://www.semana.com/nacion/santos-debe-pedir-perdon-fracaso-restitucion-engano-robledo/177914-3.aspx\" title=\"\">record on restoring land to victims of displacement is very weak</a>, despite a fairly progressive new law recognising victims' rights. While poverty is down again this year, rightly a source of pride to progressives in the government, it is still around the level it was 20 years ago \u2013 7 million Colombians live on less than $2 a day, according to the World Bank.</p> <p>But it is Santos's reverence for modernity in a world of exciting new heterodox thinking that may serve his country best, even more so than his instinct for decency. When neoliberalism was modern, Santos believed and upheld it. But Santos is a liberal, not a neoliberal. Now that neoliberalism is in history's dustbin, it is highly likely that Santos will allow his politics to be strongly influenced by new currents of economic thought, particularly those emanating from Colombia's South American neighbours. It is no coincidence that Santos refers to Colombia's inequality in almost every speech he makes, now that it is fashionable to do so, <a href=\"http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/LACEXT/0,,contentMDK:20384897~pagePK:146736~piPK:146830~theSitePK:258554,00.html\" title=\"\">with the World Bank itself leading the charge</a>. <a href=\"http://www.ukti.gov.uk/export/countries/americas/southamerica/colombia/premiumcontent/303760.html\" title=\"\">Santos's new home-building programme</a> is borrowed from Brazilian and Venezuelan success, as is his <a href=\"http://www.portafolio.co/economia/jovenes-pobres-no-estudian-no-trabajan-ni-buscan-empleo\" title=\"\">plan to pay poor young people to study</a>. Most crucially of all, if he decides to learn from the Brazilian experience of heavily investing in small farmers as a complement to mega-agroprojects, he could expect to see similar falls in hunger and poverty.</p> <p>I am even prepared to retune my critique of the <a href=\"http://www.anspe.gov.co/foro/inicio.aspx\" title=\"\">National Agency for Overcoming Extreme Poverty</a> (Anspe), which <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/apr/05/colombia-tackling-poverty-dent-statistics\" title=\"\">I wrote about a few months ago</a>. In May, I visited a woman for whom Anspe was the first serious contact with a poverty-focused state she has had in her lifetime (she was displaced to the outskirts of the city of Monter\u00eda, in northern Colombia, 30 years ago). Although oversold (an exit from poverty requires jobs, public services and infrastructure, not just visits from a social worker, as I said at a meeting with Anspe bosses afterwards), it is at least the first tentative step towards decent social security for the country's poorest inhabitants, and one initiated by Uribe, under whom official poverty figures also fell.</p> <p>These tweaks of an unjust system are not going to satisfy those who rightly continue to point to the grave human rights violations and land displacements, still unanswered for, which blight Colombia's polarised history. But if Santos has proved anything apart from his decency and modernity, it is that, like Brazil's ex-president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, he has the political nous to know the limits of the possible in a country where violence and elite power are still major factors in the political firmament.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>What is a university education for?</strong></h2> <p>When I went to university in the late 1970s, fewer than 20% of school leavers went on to higher education. Some degrees were clearly vocational (medicine perhaps the most obvious example), but most were not. My module on the comparative government of Indonesia and Nigeria has not, I am afraid to say, ever been of direct relevance to me in the world of work. However, a degree did give graduates an experience that most of their contemporaries did not have, and this experience certainly gave them some unique opportunities. The milk-round recruiting fairs run by large, often blue-chip, organisations in universities offered a route into management that was, by and large, exclusive to graduates.</p> <p>Wind forward 35 years and the UK now has 50% of school leavers progressing to any one of more than 125 universities to do a degree. The milk round is no more. Competition for graduate-level jobs has significantly increased and universities are now measured by the number of their graduates that get graduate-level jobs. However, employer organisations, including the CBI, regularly criticise universities for failing to give students the skills they need to operate in the world of work.</p> <p>In response to this criticism UK universities have developed a series of, often excellent, initiatives to ensure that the student experience \u2013 both the various degree courses run, and the extracurricular opportunities provided \u2013 give students the competences that employers want. Compared with the late 1970s, it is striking how employability is a strong feature of nearly all degree courses. There has also been a dramatic rise in the number of enterprise clubs or societies, often run by students themselves, providing comprehensive support to help students start their own businesses. In the East Midlands, the <a href=\"http://www.enterpriseinc.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Enterprise Inc</a> scheme run across nine universities even provides funding to would-be entrepreneurs.</p> <p>In 2012 a university education is still about becoming an expert in a chosen field and, I hope, learning to think in new ways, but it is increasingly and overtly about preparation for employment.</p> <h2><strong>The opportunities for social enterprise</strong></h2> <p>The public sector in the UK is going through a decade of transformation. Irrespective of which party is in power, the way services have been delivered to the public has been changing, and will continue to change. It is becoming clear that we have been living in a fool's paradise, treating ourselves to ever-more public services that we have not been able to afford.</p> <p>At the same time, the UK private sector is also experiencing severe shocks to its system. Although the private sector has delivered some impressive growth in employment opportunities, the financial crisis and the exposure of many banking practices are bringing the fundamentals of the economy into question (and we saw it coming \u2013 or should have \u2013 if you want to know why read Niall Ferguson's book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ascent-Money-unabridged-audio-book/dp/1407438948\" title=\"\">The Ascent of Money</a>, especially chapter six, From Empire to Chimerica).</p> <p>These tectonic shifts in the economy have created new opportunities for the UK's long-established social enterprise sector. All mainstream political parties in the UK are voicing support for a more mixed economy, with a strong social enterprise sector delivering products and services in innovative and responsible ways. Legislation has been passed to support the sector, and attitudes and practices are changing (albeit rather too slowly for many social entrepreneurs). Initiatives such as a <a href=\"https://socialenterprise.guardian.co.uk/en/articles/social-enterprise-network/2012/jun/13/northampton-university-student-support-service\" title=\"\">\"\u00a31bn university challenge\"</a> are increasing the opportunities for social enterprises to get high-value, long-term contracts from the public sector.</p> <h2><strong>Social enterprise and the student experience</strong></h2> <p>The growing number of opportunities for the social enterprise sector demand a response from universities. Nearly all UK universities have initiatives that provide educational and practical opportunities to get involved in social enterprise. Student-run initiatives such as the <a href=\"http://www.cambridgehub.org\" title=\"\">Cambridge Hub</a> are particularly impressive, as is the <a href=\"http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page=37825\" title=\"\">Social Enterprise Network of universities</a> run by Plymouth University, which is doing impressive research into the fundamentals of social enterprise.</p> <p>My university, <a href=\"http://www.northampton.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Northampton</a>, has gone further and faster than other UK higher education organisations in developing and implementing an institution-wide social enterprise strategy. The strategy, driven by the core value that everything we do must enhance the student experience and improve employability, covers a wide spectrum of activities ranging from support for students to set up social enterprises (including providing them with funding) to using our intellectual capital to try to influence policy and practice. All parts of the spectrum are equally important to us. After all, there is no point in developing student social entrepreneurs if we don't help develop a thriving social enterprise sector for them to work in.</p> <p>I suggest that the UK university sector has stepped up to the mark to prepare graduates for employment in the social enterprise sector. The student experience is different, and better, than it was when I went to university.</p> <p><em>Prof Simon Denny is social enterprise development director at the </em><a href=\"http://www.northampton.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>University of Northampton</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Take a bow, everyone. The London 2012 Olympic Games went better, far better, than most people ever dared to hope. They will live overwhelmingly positively in the recollection of millions who took part, attended or merely watched on television, here or around the whole world. And beyond that? These have been 17 days that may have changed this country, if not for good, then certainly in a lot of good ways that may, with luck and effort, endure. But today, Britain and its capital must awake to the realisation that the 2012 Olympic Games are over. The dream is now a memory. Although the Paralympics await, it is unlikely that the world's greatest sporting festival will return to this country for at least half a century. It is time to try to take stock of what has been achieved. The rest of our lives begins today.</p> <p>First, the sports themselves. Any successful Games needs a towering figure. Predictably, and to the delight of the organisers and the public alike, this proved to be Usain Bolt of Jamaica. His \"double triple\" \u2013 winning in both the men's track sprints and the 4x100m relay, just as he had in Beijing \u2013 provided the iconic moments of London 2012. The honour of the single greatest achievement, however, probably goes to Kenya's David Rudisha, with his <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/news/david-rudisha-tops-lord-coes-track-list-of-favourites-8034745.html\" title=\"\">world record demolition</a> of the field in the 800m final. And the greatest new hero to have emerged, certainly to the home crowd, was Mo Farah, with his sweep of both the 10,000m and 5,000m golds. Yet while Bolt, Rudisha and Farah led the field in the blue-riband Olympic sport, many enduring memories will be of the proliferation of other sports in which equally great deeds were done, in front of crowds that yielded nothing in enthusiasm to those in the Olympic Stadium itself. To list all the sports would be tedious, but the multitude of swimmers, cyclists, archers, rowers, riders and team players made these Games far more than an athletics fest with sideshows.</p> <p><strong>Sporting ethos</strong></p> <p>These were a good Olympics for sporting ethos too. London 2012's greatest milestone was the equality, and in some respects the superiority, of women's participation. No national team was male-only, for the first time. Though Saudi Arabia's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19111548\" title=\"\">Wojdan Shaherkani</a> lasted a mere 80 seconds in the women's judo competition, her appearance was a symbolic breakthrough. Cheats, it appears, were quickly banished, whether because of drugs or <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19072677\" title=\"\">gamesmanship</a>. No Olympian deserves greater honour than the German table tennis player Timo Boll, who ensured his own defeat by insisting, to immense applause, that a point had been incorrectly awarded to him rather than to his opponent. Behaviour of this kind would be unthinkable in football's Premier League, as would the displays of the genuine happiness, humility and gratitude that marked so many medalists.</p> <p>Britain did superbly well in the Games too. Targets were exceeded and a new generation of stars stepped forward as others, like cycling's Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton, departed the stage heavy with new honours. There are two great lessons of all this Olympic success. The first is that, over time, investment in sports will produce a dividend \u2013 this year's British medals are the fruit of lottery funding <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/09/sir-john-major-london-2012-games?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">decisions from the 1990s</a>. The second is that the opportunity to shine must be available to all, without respect to background. Both lessons must be well learned if the momentum is to be carried forward to Rio de Janeiro in 2016 and beyond. The prime minister <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19231492\" title=\"\">stood by Sebastian Coe yesterday</a> to give a predictably upbeat verdict on the Games, and he extended one slug of funding for a couple of years. But the country will be watching carefully for the follow-through: it has no need of a brief season of silly grandstanding.</p> <p>The Games brought out much that is best in this country. They allowed us a golden glimpse of a nation that celebrates men and women with equal awe, and embraces British athletes of all racial backgrounds. They celebrated the rich shared Britishness of competitors and supporters who are also fiercely proud of diverse roots. London had a wonderful Games, to be sure, but so did Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and English counties from Buckinghamshire to Yorkshire. Few events have done more to rescue the Union Jack from racists and royalists alike, creating a generous mood and a flag to share.</p> <p><strong>Pulling together</strong></p> <p>And then there were the thousands of volunteers who made the whole experience so enjoyable for so many. The British qualities that the Olympics president chose to emphasise this week were enthusiasm and kindness. No one should be naive about these things, but this was a compliment to be welcomed, a reminder that a heterogeneous society can pull together in difficult times to do something worth cheering, generating a more optimistic and ennobling way of seeing ourselves. Was the price right? Opinions will differ. Was the prize worth having? Absolutely. The big question now, and in the unfolding weeks, months and years, is whether the same commitment and generosity can be brought to bear in pursuit of more complex, more lasting and, dare one say it, more important endeavours than Olympic sports. Why should it not?</p>"
