  "<p>\u2022 They must have been quite a sight. Two figures, loved and reviled in equal measure, out dining on a chilly evening. What did they discuss? Power, perhaps: both have sought and exercised power. Maybe literature? Both are writers of high repute. Politics, one assumes: both see themselves maligned by lefties. Possibly law-breaking \u2013 one of them has done time, having helped himself to an awful lot of money that wasn't his, and the other has responsibility for policing. That might have provided a lighter moment, given that the latter was once recorded discussing the finer details of breaking someone's legs. One suspects that Boris Johnson would have preferred to keep his date with former boss Conrad Black low key, particularly after all that trouble about one-to-ones the mayor had with Murdoch. But <a href=\"http://www.lbc.co.uk/iain-dale-28133\" title=\"\">Conrad blabbed about the rendez-vous to broadcaster Iain Dale on the talk station LBC 97.3</a> on Sunday. The convict and the mayor united by the set menu. Never a paparazzo around when you need one.</p> <p>\u2022 Conrad was on a roll on the radio. There was none of the profanity of his earlier interviews \u2013 no&#xa0;one struck him as a \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/23/conrad-black-adam-boulton\" title=\"\">jackass</a>\" or an \"<a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/jeremy-paxman-is-an-asshole-conrad-blacks-rant-on-hignfy-8227484.html\" title=\"\">asshole</a>\". And no repetition of his threat to Paxman of physical violence. But there were dark threats of a sort against the biographer Tom Bower, whose book, Conrad and Lady Black: Dancing on the Edge, was so appallingly disrespectful. You want revenge, suggested Iain Dale. No, I don't want revenge, said Conrad sweetly. But <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2220807/Conrad-Black-blasts-Unbowed-years-jail-tycoon-launches-fierce-attack-critics--draws-battle-lines-appearance-Have-I-Got-News-For-You.html\" title=\"\">you said you would take the fillings out of his teeth and the roof off his house</a>, countered Dale. Oh, that's not revenge, said Conrad airily. When you have been where he's been, seen what he has seen,&#xa0;parameters change.</p> <p>\u2022 Furrowed brows, meanwhile, on the island of Sark, where the big wheels are the Barclay Brothers, owners of the Ritz and the Telegraph. Nosy incomers aren't always welcomed there. Right now there's such a problem. For who has pitched up but John Sweeney, the BBC reporter, scourge of the Barclays for his reporting in the past. Scourge, more recently of the Scientologists. He's making a Panorama touching on the Barclays and their business activities. No telling what he will say, or how they will respond. But we sense there is unease, because Kevin Delaney, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/27/barclays-sark-newsletter?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">described as the Barclays' lieutenant on Sark</a>, has penned a front-page denunciation of Sweeney and Panorama for the Sark News, delivered to every home on the island. In effectiveness terms, this is like trying bothering a 747 with a catapult. Trouble ahead. Set your videos.</p> <p>\u2022 Trying times at Terry towers, the former England captain's huge post-Dallas mansion taking shape in Surrey. Poor John Terry was fined \u00a3200,000 by the FA, a tad more by Chelsea perhaps, and was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/27/john-terry-verdict-chelsea-guilty\" title=\"\">forced to take a short involuntary playing holiday</a>. All&#xa0;thanks to five ill-chosen words to Anton Ferdinand a year ago on the pitch. So JT has been hit where it hurts \u2013 in the pocket, but that's not been enough to retard progress on his 11-bedroom, four-bathroom house. The excavators keep digging and the concrete mixers mixing. Terry castle is now all but complete outside, and is covered in a plastic film while the interior is fitted. Some way to go, but there is already one staple in place. The television aerials are up. He&#xa0;can watch the games that should have featured him on Match of the Day.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, on the day of the <a href=\"http://www.spearswms.com/wm-awards/32238/spears-wealth-management-awards-2012.thtml\" title=\"\">Spear's Wealth Management Awards</a> and in the week officials in London release their report on the belated assistance given to those who suffered during last year's riots, a <a href=\"http://www.spearswms.com/in-this-issue/\" title=\"\">different take from Spear's magazine</a>, the publication for the super-wealthy: riot protection tips for the 1%. \"Imagine you are in your Campden Hill drawing room during an outbreak in Ladbroke Grove,\" it says.

  "<p>Emergency legislation is being rushed through the Commons this week to correct a Home Office blunder over next month's police and crime commissioner elections that could cost up to \u00a3350,000.</p> <p>The unexpected cost covers the printing of a second set of ballot papers in Wales, where an official oversight led to legislation being passed that authorised only the printing of an English version of the ballot paper.</p> <p>Returning officers in Wales have a duty to see the Welsh language is given equal status to English. They have contingency plans to print bilingual ballot papers in Welsh and English for the poll to elect police commissioners on 15 November. The Home Office, which is to foot the bill, has confirmed that the cost will be up to \u00a3350,000.</p> <p>The Electoral Commission said the emergency legislation on the Welsh ballot papers needed to be in place by this Wednesday when the initial issue of postal votes for the elections is due to start at 5pm. \"If this order is not made, the ballot papers used in Wales will only be available to voters in English,\" the commission warned MPs.</p> <p>Labour's policing spokesman, David Hanson, said: \"This is another example of the slipshod way in which the government has organised these elections. The Home Office said they would sort this out with legislation early in the year but didn't publish it until July. It still hasn't been passed with commissioners taking up their posts in just a few weeks' time.\"</p> <p>The Home Office said it was confident the legislation will be in place.</p> <p>It also emerged that crime prevention and community safety funding for projects such as CCTV schemes, gang intervention programmes and police officers in schools are facing a 60% cut. Home Office figures show community safety funding is due to fall from \u00a374m in 2010-11 to \u00a359m in 2011-12, and to an unconfirmed allocation of only \u00a330m in this financial year.</p>",
  "<p>Diane Taylor criticises both the coalition government for having \"maintained a consistent narrative that child detention has ended\", as well as the \"adulation\" of organisations like Citizens UK, who&#xa0;campaigned so hard for this historic&#xa0;change (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/23/britain-sill-locking-up-children\" title=\"\">Still locking up children, 24 October</a>).</p> <p>She argues that \"the government's own data relating to numbers of children detained proves this is not true\". She is not comparing like with like. We have ended child detention as&#xa0;it&#xa0;existed under Labour and as we said we would in opposition. We always argued that the immigration system would still need to deal with both exceptional cases and border cases. And&#xa0;the contrast between the new system and what existed just two years ago could not be&#xa0;starker.</p> <p>Under Labour, thousands of innocent children were locked up, often for weeks at a time. It was Citizens UK's tireless campaigning that made this an issue of public concern and then held the government's feet to the fire to end this barbaric practice and reach a solution acceptable to the communities most affected. Working together, we succeeded.</p> <p>When we first met, 30 families from Uganda alone were locked up in prison-like conditions. Today, none are. We worked together to design an alternative that has the welfare of children at its heart. Far from being a \"mixed bag\", as&#xa0;Taylor suggests, we feel that the recent HMIP report shows we have got it right. Importantly, the new measures we have taken, such as the Independent Family Returns Panel, have ensured that the vast majority of children and families can stay in their communities before returning home.</p> <p>Those who can't are accommodated in&#xa0;the new \"exceptional facility\" \u2013 Cedars, which consists of nine self-contained, family-friendly apartments and is a world away from the infamous family unit at Yarl's Wood (which was closed by the coalition government). Barnardo's provides emotional support and educational play to help families and&#xa0;children understand the process they are going through. Cedars is required because there will always be exceptional cases in which families, who the law says should be returned home, need a decent stopping off point before they can board a plane. This is a necessary part of a civilised but effective immigration system.</p> <p>Much of Taylor's argument is predicated on the use of \"ordinary immigration centres such as Tinsley House, near Gatwick\". Tinsley House is nothing of the sort. The newly refurbished facility is used for border cases. It has never been used as an \"overflow facility\" and&#xa0;never will be \u2013 not least because that is one of Barnardo's red lines.</p> <p>The fact is we have always made clear that it would still be necessary to hold some families at the border who have been refused entry. Otherwise, we would simply have no border controls for anyone with children. In these cases, every effort is made to put the family on the very next flight available. Sometimes, however, there is a short delay, and they are transferred to more family friendly facilities at Tinsley House before their flight.</p> <p>Taylor may have a different view of how the immigration system should be run and how \"detention\" is defined. But she should not accuse the government of \"doublespeak\" because what we are doing does not fit with her view. To say our system evokes \"the same concerns that existed about child detention in its previous incarnation\" is to both ignore the scandalous situation under Labour and insult those, like both of us, who campaigned for its end and are proud to&#xa0;have brought it about.</p> <p><em> </em></p>",
  "<p>Formula One has left India, though in this vast and noisy nation of 1.2 billion people it is doubtful whether many noticed. The sport however, did leave one of its number behind, not one of the behind-the-scenes staff but one of its most celebrated stars: Lewis Hamilton.</p> <p>Hamilton's recent press cuttings have often had a bitter, pejorative flavour, not least because \u2013 for many \u2013 he is the personification of Formula One's narcissism, a great driver but one who too easily drifts into solipsism and the pursuit of celebrity status.</p> <p>On this occasion though, the reports will all be positive. He is staying in India to fulfil charity duties \u2013 not because they have been thrust upon him by McLaren, whose demands on his time have irked the driver, but because it is something that comes from his heart.</p> <p>\"I'm staying here for a couple of days to do some work with Unicef in India,\" Hamilton said. \"I'm taking a flight tomorrow to an outskirts area to raise awareness of some of the hospitals out here and the malnutrition of some of the kids.</p> <p>\"I'm a little bit nervous about it because it was such a huge shock when I went to Manila, in the Philippines, so I can imagine here that it is going to be worse.</p> <p>\"In Manila they were all kids on the streets, as they will be here. But over here, perhaps, they're more malnourished. In this day and age, when you can build a circuit for whatever this cost [\u00a3300m is a figure cited] \u2026 if you can do that, if there is money like that in the world, and there are billions being made, I don't understand how it's possible that people are still starving on the streets.\"</p> <p>There was anger in his words but it was quietly spoken because Hamilton, who has been surrounded by members of his family in India, cut a deeply relaxed figure.</p> <p>\"I love kids,\" he added. \"I just want to see if I can lift some kids' spirits. It's no sweat off my back to go and help some people like that. They are far, far, far less fortunate than I am or anyone of us are. It's so minuscule, and it should be done more. That's why I'm doing it. And I want to do more work with many more charities in the future.</p> <p>\"This is just the beginning of my work with XIX Entertainment [his agents]. They had no control of the decision I made this year [to leave McLaren and join Mercedes]. They've done nothing wrong. They've just supported me in what I wanted to do, and I said I wanted to do more charity work, and I want to do more appearances, helping charities, helping young kids. I went to a Samuel L Jackson Foundation event the other day, and then a cancer charity event. It takes nothing out of our lives to help bring attention to these things.\"</p> <p>And as he spoke there was resonance of the old Hamilton, the one who beguiled us with his charm and generosity of spirit as much as his astonishing speed, the man he was before he disappeared under a cloud of sullen introspection for much of 2011. Hamilton also hopes to see more of his family in future races. \"It makes a huge, huge difference. I can't explain how hard I've been trying to improve things to the harmony that we had here.</p> <p>\"My career started out by having my family around. I was so much more relaxed. Well, I was relaxed in certain areas and stressed in others. But, you know, your family, your blood, is the one group of people you can trust with your heart and your soul. So it was good to have them here and I'm bringing some of my cousins to Abu Dhabi.\"</p> <p>Sunday's Indian Grand Prix, which was won by Sebastian Vettel, his fourth in a row as he extended his lead over Fernando Alonso to 13 points (Hamilton was fourth, though he was pleased with his drive), was watched by 65,000, one-third down on last year's 95,000. Facilities, though, were much improved, as the Buddh International Circuit put last year's many teething problems behind them.</p> <p>The fall in attendance figures did not appear to concern the sport's chief executive, Bernie Ecclestone, who had a point when he said: \"First races are always high and the second year goes down. If the third year isn't going up, then it's something to worry about.\"</p> <p>Formula One is clearly popular with members of India's young and aggressively acquisitive middle-class. But it is still difficult to discern its meaning to the majority of the population, for although India is a miracle of development and progress there is still widespread and appalling poverty.</p> <p>Jayati Ghosh, who is professor of economics at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, one of the country's respected voices, says: \"Formula One is a luxury indulgence of the very rich, another means of wealth along with the huge houses, fancy luxury cars, diamonds.</p> <p>\"It is extraordinarily wasteful of resources in a country that still does not provide basic amenities to around half of the population. It is really an insult not just to the poor but to 90% of the population, another example of hubris among the Indian elite.\"</p> <p>Ghosh has no time for the sports excesses, it seems, but would undoubtedly approve of Hamilton's role in India this week.</p>",
  "<p>Richard Hammond has \u2013 not for first time \u2013 spun off. This is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mj59\" title=\"\"><strong>Top Gear</strong></a> (BBC2), but it's a special one, 50 Years of Bond Cars, because 007 is all anyone cares about right now, you may have noticed. So Richard gets to drive some lovely cars \u2013 an Aston Martin DB5 of course, like the one in Goldfinger (and other films \u2013 in fact this is the actual one from Bond's current outing Skyfall). And he drives a Lotus Esprit like the one in The Spy Who Loved Me, the one that could go under water. Plus some other cars that are less iconic, which will appeal more to Richard's normal TG audience.</p> <p>There's lots here to keep Top Gear Twerp amused. He \u2013 let's face it, chances are it is a he \u2013 can nod along in agreement that it's ridiculous that the DB5 kept up with a Ferrari 355 in GoldenEye. He can chuckle when Richard calls the BMW Z3 a hairdresser's car. And at the jokes about the Alfa GTV's (un)reliability. Yes, if Bond did spend more time behind the wheel of an Alfa, he would always be arriving at the baddies' hollowed-out volcano on the back of a tow truck, hahaha. Top Gear Twerp does love an Alfa Romeo reliability joke. He can laugh away, like he does when he's in the Top Gear studio audience.</p> <p>But there's also plenty for the non-petrolhead as well, things about people as well as cars. So Hammond talks to old directors, less old directors, stuntmen. There are nice stories, about the bus driver who came out to Jamaica to decapitate a Routemaster by driving it under a low bridge. About some poor bugger in the boot of the Aston letting off smoke bombs. And Cubby Broccoli peeling banknotes off a big roll and handing them out to stunt drivers who'd pulled off something dangerous. And some other poor bugger who sadly got killed. Good times though. With the Bond family.</p> <p>Hammond talks to a couple of actual Bonds too. The current one \u2013 Daniel Craig \u2013 who likes the car from You Only Live Twice: \"Is it the Datsun?\"</p> <p>\"Toyota 2000,\" Richard corrects him.</p> <p>\"Is that what it is?\" says Daniel.</p> <p>And he meets Roger Moore, who likes the car from For Your Eyes Only, \"the little two-stroke whatever it was ...\"</p> <p>\"2CV,\" says Richard, not bothering to correct the two-stroke bit. Interesting, that these real Bonds don't seem to care much, certainly don't know much, about their cars. Could it be that properly cool people aren't Top Gear Twerps and vice versa?</p> <p>To be honest I don't mind the hamst ... no I'm sorry, I can't bring myself to call him by that nickname \u2013 you know, the small rodent that he resembles a bit and shares some letters with. Is it just me or does anyone else immediately think of a certain Hollywood movie star? Remember those rumours? Now replace the pet in question with (an even smaller than he actually is) Hammond ... not nice is it? Oh, it is just me? Apologies then, to everyone.</p> <p>Anyway Richard's OK, he's a bit annoying but at least he's enthusiastic, and not as groansome as the big Top Gear Oaf. You know who I mean. Jeremy Clarkson.</p> <p>Small confession: I have been known to watch Top Gear, and not just for my job. Yes, I know it's presented by morons, in a studio full of morons, for even more morons at home (they seemed to have morphed from twerps into morons). But I do quite like cars. And the stunts they pull are sometimes quite jolly.</p> <p>Look, the hamst ... Richard's brought a couple with him, to his spin-off. They actually make the underwater Lotus from The Spy Who Loved Me, they never even did that in the movie. It works too; that's actually quite an impressive piece of engineering. And \u2013 better, certainly funnier, still \u2013 they make an \"invisible\" van, simply to show that the invisibility cloak of Pierce Brosnan's Aston Martin Vanquish in Die Another Day isn't too big a leap of the imagination.</p> <p>Cameras on Richard's van film the surroundings, relaying the background on to giant TVs stuck to the van's sides. \"I have simply vanished,\" he says. Which isn't strictly true, but it certainly looks funny. I'm laughing anyway. Not a proper lol perhaps, but certainly a chortle. I guess that makes me a moron \u2013 and a Top Gear Twerp \u2013 too.</p>",
  "<p>Former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond and other bosses there could be hauled before the high court to explain what they knew about the Libor interest rate fixing scandal.</p> <p>A high court judge has ruled that a landmark trial into Barclays' role in rigging the London interbank lending rate (Libor) must go ahead, with the bank's bosses, including Diamond, called into the witness box.</p> <p>\"There is obviously a question as to what Mr Diamond knew [about Libor-rigging] and when he knew it,\" Mr Justice Flaux said during a preliminary hearing into the case at the high court.</p> <p>Guardian Care Homes (GCH) is suing Barclays for up to \u00a337m over the alleged mis-selling of interest rate hedging products (swaps). The residential care homes operator says it should be fully compensated as the swaps were based on Libor rates that had been fiddled by banks.</p> <p>Barclays has agreed to pay \u00a3290m of fines to US and British authorities over its role in the manipulation of Libor and other key interest rates.</p> <p>The judge said Barclays was \"being very coy\" about identifying which of its staff were involved in the Libor fixing scandal, adding that the court would draw its own inference \"unless and until they go into the witness box\".</p> <p>In an extraordinary attack on Barclays bosses, Flaux told Adrian Beltrami QC, for the bank: \"Your client knows who it is who is responsible for all this \u2013 they must do.\" He went on to accuse Barclays of trying to use complex legal arguments to \"shut out\" the case.</p> <p>\"This is all shadow-boxing. Your client knows jolly well what this is being alleged,\" Flaux said. \"The real issue is that they are trying to shut it out at this stage because they don't like it. What they're trying to do is shut it out altogether.\" Beltrami had argued that the swap contract Barclays sold in the case did not mention how the Libor rate was set, so the claim should not be allowed.</p> <p>Tim Lord QC, representing GCH, said Libor products should come with a health warning similar to cigarettes: \"Entering into these Libor swaps will seriously damage your financial health.\"</p> <p>Flaux ruled that the GCH case should go to trial at the end of October.</p> <p>Barclays had argued that GCH's advisers included Rothschild bankers and prominent law firms with financial expertise, so it should have understood the products it was buying and their terms. \"[GCH] is a significant business that owes Barclays \u00a370m. We do not believe any aspect of the case has merit and are defending it,\" a Barclays spokesman said.</p> <p>Gary Hartland, GCH chief executive, said: \"Today is a huge milestone with a trial now going forward. Our claim is not just based on mis-selling but on the effect of senior management at Barclays instructing the aggressive selling of [financial products] while attempting to rig Libor.\" John Walker, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"This legal battle will be watched carefully by the thousands of small businesses affected by mis-selling who may decide to take a similar route.\"</p> <p>Lord said the case is \"likely to be the tip of the iceberg\", leading to other claims against banks over the Libor scandal.</p> <p>The Financial Services Authority estimates 44,000 interest rate swaps \u2013 a form of insurance to protect companies from interest rate changes \u2013 have been mis-sold to UK companies since 2001.</p> <p>The test case is also likely to lead to the disclosure of hundreds of thousands of internal emails related to the Libor scandal. The court heard that lawyers for GCH had requested the disclosure of more than 1.3m documents from Barclays. The bank's lawyers said GCH had requested \"indiscriminate disclosure\" and Barclays wanted to limit the number of documents it would be forced to hand over.</p> <p>The ruling came as French prosecutors announced that they had opened a preliminary investigation into whether banks in France were also involved. UK and US authorities have already begun detailed probes into the Libor affair.</p>",
  "<p>In any election, politicians' pretty much always-false modesty prompts them to exclaim that they themselves are playing but a part in the march of history. Obama cut an <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBorRZnqtMo\">ad</a> that admitted:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Sometimes, politics can seem very small \u2013 but the choice you face?

Though Sandy may finally bring a discussion about the environment to the forefront of politicians' minds, one of humanity's only creations that's almost impervious to the kind of force battering the US east coast is denial. (Then again, note the Earth's stubborn, intractable reactions to our abuse.)</p> <p>We can talk about \"man-made\" climate change, but there's a difference between having control over something and taking responsibility for it. Our part in global warming is more like that of someone dropping a lit cigarette in the forest, rather than someone starting a fire for heat.</p> <p>As for arguments about who did or didn't \"build that\" \u2013 Sandy don't care. Buildings are flimsy and our plans even more insubstantial; our opinions revealed to be nothing more than spit and a wish for wind in the right direction.</p> <p>You can sense among political professionals a vague sense of panic about Sandy, which is ancillary to the more specific and very real worries that they harbor about loved ones and their own, mostly likely east coast, lives.</p> <p>We don't yet know Sandy's precise impact on the election \u2013 on a practical level, the storm will disrupt early in-person voting, rallies in east-coast states will go unattended, ads may be inescapable when people are driven indoors, or they may be unwatched in places that lose power. Beyond that immediate effect, will Sandy wash away political trivia and remind voters of the true stakes of picking a president? Will these disruptions freeze the race where it is, or will Sandy remind people of the stakes involved in picking a leader, swaying them toward the one who seems the safer choice?</p> <p>The magnitude of the storm should underscore, not contrast, the relationship between the people's will and predictions that existed before. It's not as though pundits and pols had any better idea of what would happen prior to Sandy's landfall. This election has been unprecedented on so many levels, you couldn't even tweet them all: the amount of money being spent, the ideological divide between the parties, the infuriating vagueness of one candidate's ideas.</p> <p>Sandy is just another element beyond control: you can't even poll a storm \u2013 much like the ideas of low-information, undecided voters, it's nothing but a resounding, echoing howl.</p> <p>The Frankenstorm \u2013 an appellation that would make&#xa0;Mary Shelley&#xa0;wince at the lack of a possessive, though she might approve of the sentiment \u2013 is an immediate, measurable reminder that politics is, in the end, not about messaging and postures and positioning, but the structure of people's lives: who they can turn to when they have no resources left themselves, who they can look to when all the options are bad, and what they can do with what they have left when it seems like nothing at all.</p> <p>We're not choosing the nation's CEO, a boss-in-chief. Mitt Romney's approach to poor performance is eliminating jobs, it's only Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) employees he could fire \u2013 and he's said he <a href=\"http://wonkette.com/488017/mitt-romney-iz-in-ur-hurricane-privatizin-ur-fema\">wants</a> to \u2013 not the natural disaster itself. You can't put the bravery of first responders on a balance sheet, or quantify human loss.</p> <p>Whoever becomes president, the job is really that of a community organizer \u2013 whether that's the role they're prepared for or not.</p>",

He took the opportunity to compare himself to such whippersnappers as Pitt, Churchill and most of all Disraeli, who made his maiden speech when he was a year younger than Mr Hancock is now. In particular, he felt kinship with the former prime minister because \"we both had a provincial background\". So do the great majority of people in this country, but never mind.</p> <p>So there was tension and excitement when Mr Hancock stood up to answer his first parliamentary question on Monday. (There was also some interest in David Laws, the Lib Dem former cabinet minister who has been readmitted to the government two and a half years after resigning over his part in the expenses scandal. Some of his colleagues have gone to jail; Mr Laws has gone to a nicely furnished ministerial office with people to bring him coffee in porcelain cups.) But it was Mr Hancock we were watching, and there was plenty to watch. He doesn't just speak at the dispatch box; he emotes. He strikes poses, rather like those old portraits of actors who always seem to have blazing eyes and an arm pointed to the heavens.</p> <p>His hands chop the air dramatically, or on other occasions are flung out, bringing peril to anyone sitting nearby. His voice rises and then drops for no apparent reason. You feel that instead of him talking about such workaday topics as funding for technical colleges, he should be declaiming: \"To BE! Or [low, husky voice] not [sudden bellow] TO BE That!! Is \u2026 THE question!\"</p> <p>He poses, too, sometimes twisting himself round on his own axis to face the Speaker, on another occasion leaning across the dispatch box with his hands hovering over the table of the house, and his bottom sticking out towards the secretary of state, as if Gove were about to cane him.</p> <p>So it was a shame that almost his first ministerial remark was in response to Labour's Stephen Hepburn, who had complained that many so-called apprenticeships involved stacking shelves and making sandwiches.</p> <p>Mr Hancock responded thunderously: \"I am in favour of sandwiches!\"</p> <p>It was not perhaps a line that you would often hear from one of his role models. (Or want to; Disraeli remarked that \"a Conservative government is an organised hypocrisy\", and \"England does not love coalitions\".)</p> <p>Pitt never said: \"Roll up that chicken salad wrap; it will not be wanted these 10 years.\" Nor did Churchill say to the British people: \"I have nothing to offer you but ham, egg, cheese or prawn.\"</p> <p>But with self-esteem like Mr Hancock's, I doubt that he will be down for long.</p>",
  "<p>David Davies and Graham Poll are among those leading calls for the opaque, often vexed, relationship between professional footballers and match officials to be the subject of increased transparency. The former executive director of the Football Association and the former Premier League referee would like the conversations between referees, linesmen and fourth officials, which thanks to earpieces and microphones routinely take place during matches, to be recorded. This is the norm in rugby and American football's NFL.</p> <p>Except in occasional instances used for training purposes, similar \"taping\" does not happen in football but Poll, who officiated at two World Cups, said \"referees would be in favour\" of recordings being made and publicised. As an FA official Davies campaigned for the introduction of such a measure but met resistance from groups in the game, most notably the Professional Footballers' Association.</p> <p>\"It is quite beyond me why 90 minutes of conversations aren't always recorded,\" Davies said. \"Referees' conversations should be available to fans who pay their wages, if anything, to be aware of what the referees themselves have to put up with. If the language is so bad, someone has to do something about improving it without sanitising the game. A point has been reached and in this generation you have got to do something about it.\"</p> <p>Such a system would serve as football's equivalent of the aviation industry's black box flight recorders and the idea of its implementation was endorsed by the Guardian columnist, The Secret Footballer. \"I'm pretty confident that players would think more than twice about swearing at any official if they thought everyone could hear them,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/may/07/the-secret-footballer-referees\" title=\"\">he wrote in a column penned in May 2011</a>. \"I know I would.\"</p> <p>As things stand, all four match officials \u2013 the referee, his two assistants and the fourth official \u2013 wear microphones and earpieces that allow them to hear what each other is saying throughout the match. Accordingly Chelsea's accusations that Mark Clattenburg, who refereed their 3-2 home defeat against Manchester United on Sunday, subjected Mikel John Obi to \"inappropriate language\" may well hinge on the evidence of his assistant referees, Michael McDonough and Simon Long, as well as that of Michael Jones, the fourth official. \"A referee's microphone is on open,\" Poll said. \"Everything he says is heard by two assistants. So if Mark said something, the assistants would have heard it.\"</p> <p>Were any recordings to be made public, the content would almost certainly be partly comedic and extremely shocking. Although things have improved, with bookings for dissent in healthy decline since the introduction of the FA's Respect campaign, all things are relative. Cringe-inducing, playground-type jibes abound and the sheer scale of players' swearing towards match officials would inevitably be highlighted. Meanwhile the referees' use of the odd expletive themselves \u2013 something Poll admits he occasionally resorted to \u2013 could provoke consternation.</p> <p>\"There are a couple of referees who swear as much as some of the players,\" commented the Secret Footballer. \"Telling them to fuck off if they go near them and worse.\"</p> <p>Apart from identifying these culprits, the ability to play back in-game chat would, crucially, clear up claims such as Sunday's. Poll could certainly have done with football's answer to the black box being up and running when, in November 2006, he was accused of having told Chelsea players he \"wanted to teach them a lesson\" during their 2-1 defeat at Tottenham. Chelsea withdrew the allegations but</p> <p>he refereed Chelsea's 2-1 defeat at Tottenham, sending John Terry off in the process.</p> <p>Terry's red card prefaced considerable anger from Jose Mourinho, Chelsea's then manager and his squad. So much so that, the day after the game Ashley Cole accused Poll of having told his team-mates that he \"wanted to teach them a lesson\" while Terry claimed Poll had made conflicting comments to him on the pitch and then in the dressing room afterwards.</p> <p>Much to Poll's dismay the FA launched an investigation but, two weeks later, Chelsea withdrew their allegations and Terry was fined \u00a310,000 for his claims. Poll later said the incident contributed to his decision to retire the following year.</p> <p>Jeff Winter, another former Premier League referee, found it ironic that Clattenburg had been accused of using inappropriate language given the abuse that, despite the Respect campaign, match officials are still frequently exposed to from professionals.</p> <p>\"It's slightly ironic that players dish it out left, right and centre and then, if \u2013 and there is a massive if \u2013 something has been said back, and we're not talking about racial here, we're talking about like for like \u2013 then I don't think anybody's got a right to complain,\" Winter said.</p> <p>\"We watch football matches every week of the year hearing players use insulting words to referees and then somebody takes umbrage when somebody allegedly says something back.</p> <p>\"I'm not saying referees should do it but there seems to be one law for one set of people and one law for another, but this inference that racial language has been used is very, very serious. I just hope it can be cleared up.\"</p> <p>Mandatory recordings of conversations between match officials and players would not only simplify the FA's job but open a fascinating, arguably necessary, window into the game's on-pitch interactions.</p>",
  "<p>A small mushroom cloud of indignation greeted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/29/nick-clegg-attacks-philip-hammond-trident\" title=\"\">Philip Hammond's nuclear announcement</a> on his first trip to Faslane. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg accused the defence secretary of \"jumping the gun\" with a pre-emptive \u00a3350m announcement that his party will thunder ahead with a like-for-like replacement for Trident. As a coalition review of possible alternatives reports in January, why this poke in the eye? Lib Dems protested convincingly at this provocative political positioning to appease the Tory right.</p> <p>But for all the radioactive language, this hard blue dividing line doesn't displease their coalition partners. Why&#xa0;would it? Both sides yearn for separate identities \u2013 and with the final decision kicked beyond the election to 2016, both can safely posture with no threat to the coalition.</p> <p>Tim Farron, the Lib Dem president, says it is inconceivable his party would ever be \"handcuffed to Trident\". He tells me, \"We are making this an election issue for 2015\", boasting that \"we have already prevented a vast amount of money being wasted on it in this parliament.\" Nick Clegg said yesterday that he would prevent the spending of \"billions and billions and billions of pounds on a nuclear missile system designed with the sole strategic purpose of flattening Moscow at the press of a button\".</p> <p>All who opine from every party speak solemnly of the need to make the right decision on Britain's defence for the next 50 years. Believe not a word of it: they are all thinking of the election in two and a half years. The Lib Dems will be pleased to be the least pro-nuclear party, hoping to woo anti-war votes they won from Labour over Iraq, but lost over coalescing with Tories. The Tories are happy to defend repeating a defence system designed in the early 1960s, because that's where their supporters are.</p> <p>Alex Salmond will be smiling too. If Philip Hammond thought he was sending a missile into the SNP campaign for the 2014 referendum, he blew it. The Labour side of the \"Better together\" campaign says there are many fruitful defence issues that might swing the debate away from independence: could Scots still join the British army and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/22/scotland-independence-nuclear-weapons-nato\" title=\"\">should they join Nato</a>? But instead Hammond chose the one question Salmond feels is on his winning ground \u2013<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/21/alex-salmond-independent-scotland-trident\" title=\"\"> ridding Scotland of nuclear weapons</a>.</p> <p>So we know where everyone stands \u2013 except Labour. Deep policy thought is in progress. Ask, and it all depends who you talk to. Some in Labour are nuclear-heads because they occupy seats such as John Woodcock's Barrow, a one-industry town dependent on defence. Others are nuclear out of strong conviction a unilateralist Labour would be dead at the polls. Probably no one in Labour actually believes we need a Trident replacement for national defence \u2013 only for political defence of Labour. The higher theology of nuclear weapons was always about face, status and politics.</p> <p>In Tony Blair's autobiography, he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/sep/16/trident-expensive-useless-liam-fox\" title=\"\">admits his reasons for cleaving to Trident </a>were essentially political. But others, around Ed Miliband, see the end of all those political certainties. What use is a cold-war deterrent against present terrorism? Do we want to keep punching above our weight, why and at what cost?</p> <p>But these subtle existential national questions will be put through the mincer of election warfare. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/26/trident-nuclear-missiles-review-downgrading\" title=\"\">Sir Nick Harvey</a>, on being evicted from the defence department, says the review he was supervising will suggest third ways, stretching existing systems out for far longer, or as he put it, keeping a nuclear deterrent in a cupboard for a rainy day.</p> <p>He admits that the 2016 deadline is entirely artificial, a political convenience that has nothing to do with the state of rust on submarines. Harvey plainly hopes Labour will opt for a third-way approach too. But the Tories itch for the chance to mount a Kinnock-like attack on Red Ed, weak on defence. So which way will Labour jump on Trident?</p> <p>Talking to someone alarmingly close to Labour decision-making, of pro-nuclear persuasion, you can still hear the mad old rationale for Trident, the need for continuous at-sea capability, the pretence we will be vulnerable unless a replacement is agreed by 2016. Alternatives are rapidly dismissed: land-based nukes would require a massively defended piece of land and that would cost more. So would an air-based system, with complex refuelling. So, yes, it's the new subs or nothing.</p> <p>Or, they whisper, there might be a cheap option but if the UK designed one, that would cause terrifying proliferation among all the world's small wannabe nuclear countries. What? Did he really say that? Any discussion of nuclear weapons soon reaches a point where it becomes clear that those who get up too close have their brains irradiated with nuclear nonsense. We must not only have the deterrent, but it must be super-expensive to keep the market price too high for new contenders?</p> <p>Another cross-party review of Trident is headed by former defence secretaries Malcolm Rifkind, Labour's Des Brown and Menzies Campbell. There is a chance here that new thinking might break the deadlock in British nuclear politics. A costing they commissioned says the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/21/trident-nuclear-missiles-savings\" title=\"\">full Trident price tag is \u00a383.5bn</a> \u2013 or \u00a31.86bn a year until 2062.</p> <p>Is Labour really going to sign up to that? Few who know his mind think Ed Miliband will, though he may have to reshuffle his cabinet to abandon Trident. Nothing about the nuclear debate has ever been real, except the money and the votes. If some cheaper unreality emerges \u2013 a bomb in a cupboard \u2013 Labour and Lib Dems should both seize it, turning on the Tories for the \u00a33bn they will have wasted already.</p> <p>How will defence play out at the election? Pollsters don't know, since the issue has been in the deep freeze for so long. All depends on how you ask the question, says Ipsos Mori's Ben Page: a while ago voters were evenly balanced for keeping Trident, but told the cost in hospitals and schools, people turned against it. Yet pride in historic power is strong too, and fears can be stirred. YouGov's Peter Kellner agrees that people are reluctant to let go of past glory. Much will depend on winning strong backers: to abandon Trident, Labour needs cover from ex-generals calling for boots not nukes, plus experts from thinktanks like Chatham House and Rusi denouncing archaic cold war weaponry.</p> <p>But Kellner would warn the Tories too that they will need influential voices \u2013 not just the admirals \u2013 to convince voters new nuclear submarines are worth so much money at a time like this. Philip Hammond just fired the starting gun. We wait to see which way Labour jumps.</p>",
  "<p>\"We have more urgent problems than gays.\" \"I don't care whether there are gays or not, whether they are killed or they live. I am not gay, why should it bother me?\" \"I am OK with gays as long as they stay gay from afar.\" \"I don't want them killed, but I'm not going to get killed for gays either.\" Attitudes like these are&#xa0;commonly heard among my Ugandan compatriots. Two years ago my own attitude would not have been that different. I was among a section of Ugandan society that strongly believed the country had more pressing problems to address than the struggles of sexual minorities. Part of the reason for this is that I come from the <a href=\"http://www.africa.upenn.edu/NEH/u-ethn.html\" title=\"\">Acholi ethnic group</a>, which has endured a quarter of a century of war, and many of whom still live in fear of the rebel warlord <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/08/joseph-kony-lords-resistance-army\" title=\"\">Joseph Kony</a>. We had our own tragedy: the fight for equality, dignity and restorative justice for the people of&#xa0;northern Uganda.</p> <p>But then, while I was writing a play about the war in northern Uganda, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT\" title=\"\">LGBT</a> cause chose me. I had never heard&#xa0;of homosexuality as a sexual orientation until 2009, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/29/uganda-death-sentence-gay-sex\" title=\"\">when Uganda introduced its anti-homosexuality bill</a> amid massive international protests. Hearing about it in that context made it very easy for me to believe that most of the negative things being said about gay people were true, such as that they were \"recruiting\" young high school students&#xa0;into&#xa0;the \"practice\" using materialistic enticement.</p> <p>But at the <a href=\"https://www.sundance.org/programs/theatre-lab/\" title=\"\">Sundance Theatre Lab</a>, I found myself working with a scriptwriting mentor who was gay, and&#xa0;also creative, intelligent and generous. This made me reassess my understanding of homosexuality. I realised that the value of a human being is not measured by his or her sexuality. It also&#xa0;made me realise that one day I could wake up to find someone I loved being put to the noose and wouldn't be able to do anything about it. And all because I, like so many Ugandans, was in denial that anyone I knew could be gay. I felt changed, and I knew I wanted to do something. So I decided to&#xa0;write a play.</p> <p>I spent the better half of 2010 carrying out research. Among other things, I wondered about whether the concept of homosexuality existed in African culture. I also wanted to investigate the structured recruitment of children by the LGBT community. As I always do, I first consulted my&#xa0;reliable team of Acholi elders. They&#xa0;told me that gay men and women have always existed among the Acholi society and are commonly referred to as \"<em>obedo dako dako</em>\" (gay) and \"<em>obedo lacoo lacoo</em>\" (lesbian). They also acknowledged that the communal nature of the Acholi society forced many gay and lesbian people to conform to what was considered \"normal\".</p> <p>I also learned that what the government characterises as \"recruitment\" can also be seen as mentorship and compassionate protection. When a girl or boy is struggling with what they have been told are \"abnormal\" sexual attractions, it is tradition for members of the LGBT community to take them in and help them understand who they are. Through this counsel, these young people come to understand that there is nothing wrong with them.</p> <p>Whatever they are going through is normal. They are not alone.</p> <p>Equally&#xa0;important to my education, I found that sexual abuse by LGBT individuals was no more&#xa0;frequent than by heterosexual adults who abuse children.</p> <p>After this preliminary research, I contacted the LGBT community in Uganda for interviews, and was&#xa0;put in touch with <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/ugandan-rights-activist-wins-top-human-rights-award-2011-05-03\" title=\"\">Kasha Jacqueline Nabagesera</a>, founder of the&#xa0;LGBT rights&#xa0;organisation, <a href=\"http://www.kabissa.org/directory/faruganda\" title=\"\">Freedom&#xa0;and Roam Uganda</a>. At first Kasha was wary: why did I want to write a play about them? I told her that I believed we Ugandans can sometimes over-react to hearsay, when we should do careful research and get concrete, balanced information. Soon after, Kasha organised the interviews that helped me develop my play. I hope that audiences&#xa0;will not only be&#xa0;moved by&#xa0;the&#xa0;story but inspired to help us bring&#xa0;the play and educational campaigns to Uganda and the other countries \u2013 78 in total \u2013 where it remains a crime to be gay. In five of these nations, as will be the case if Uganda's anti-homosexuality legislation passes, death is the ultimate penalty.</p> <p>Will Uganda ever experience a moment of dramatic change or reverse on this issue? I don't know. Perhaps most people will never have the awakening that I did. So long as they don't, thousands of LGBT people will continue to live in fear of being themselves. But,&#xa0;we the writers and artists, no matter how late we join the battle, will be alongside them in their fight, if&#xa0;armed only with a pen.</p>",
  "<p>In the sleek modern offices of Teach First, near London Bridge, young men and women, looking barely out of their teens, hurry hither and thither. I wait outside meeting rooms with names on their doors: Commitment, Integrity, Excellence, Collaboration, Leadership. I am taken to Integrity to meet Brett Wigdortz, the 39-year-old American-born founder and chief executive of Teach First, who seems diffident and a little tense. I point out that he sits opposite a notice that commands \"speak honestly\". He does not laugh.</p> <p>Wigdortz believes he is the leader of a cultural revolution, and that is indeed no joking matter. In his new book, Success Against the Odds \u2013 which carries lavish praise for Teach First from all three party leaders, plus HRH the Prince of Wales \u2013 he declares that lack of opportunity for young Britons from low-income backgrounds is \"a modern day version of the ancient scourge of slavery or feudalism\".</p> <p>The answer, he argues, is to engage the best of British graduates, who previously regarded teaching as a desperate last resort, in a mission to raise standards and aspirations in disadvantaged schools. They commit to teach for two years in such schools, during which they acquire a PGCE. Thereafter, they may continue teaching, or they may not. But if they move into business, politics, or elsewhere, they should continue to support poor children's education by, for example, joining governing bodies, mentoring promising pupils or supporting sponsorship schemes.</p> <p>Teach First, now in its 10th year, recruits about 1,000 graduates annually, one in eight of them from Oxbridge, and nearly all with at least an upper second. The competition is stiff: only one in seven applicants is accepted. The successful are enrolled, not on anything so mundane as a training course, but on a \"leadership development programme\". They join not a college or department, but \"a movement\". After a four-week residential course, they plunge into classrooms, following 80-85% of a full timetable, with tuition and mentoring throughout the year. They can also take a short leadership course at a business college and, during the summer holidays, internships with Teach First sponsors such as Goldman Sachs, HSBC and Deloitte.</p> <p>So is the scheme for potential teachers or for potential business high-flyers who want to burnish their CVs? Where exactly does the balance between altruism and ambition lie? Wigdortz is adamant. \"We have a very clear mission: to address educational disadvantage and reduce the gap between low-income and high-income students. We look for leaders because we think great teachers need to be great leaders. Most people starting our programme don't expect to stay in teaching. But they start loving the kids and moving to leadership positions within the school.\" After five years, more than half are still in teaching (more than 90% in state schools), which is roughly the same as those from conventional PGCEs. Of the others, the vast majority are still involved with Teach First as \"ambassadors\". \"About 15% or 20% of our recruits go into business. But hardly any just wave goodbye to the kids.\"</p> <p>Later, I find an Observer article of 2005 that quotes a Teach First recruitment officer saying \"some people who'd probably make very good teachers\" are rejected \"because they wouldn't be of interest to other fast-track employers\". I email Wigdortz for comment. He replies: \"We have NEVER had the goal or mission of producing high-flying people for business \u2026 We certainly take lots \u2026 who would not be of interest to [business fast-track] schemes.\" He adds, though, that leadership and teaching skills are \"broadly transferable\", an important point to emphasise to graduates who want to keep options open.</p> <p>Wigdortz has always needed nifty footwork. To get Teach First started, he overcame scepticism from politicians, civil servants, teacher trainers and headteachers, who thought British graduates lacked sufficient idealism to go slumming in the inner cities. He was born and bred in New Jersey \u2013 not, he says, the part where people commute to lucrative jobs in New York banks. His father was in marketing, but many relatives, including his mother and brother, are teachers. Wigdortz himself, however, never considered teaching and found his schooling \u2013 at local \"public schools\", US definition \u2013 \"a bit boring overall\". After an economics and international studies degree, he spent several years in Asia as a freelance journalist. He then started a law course in New York, but gave up after a day: \"It was just too detailed and not enough about people.\" He went back to live with his parents \u2013 \"they were annoyed\" \u2013 and took a delivery job with Cluck-U fried chicken, from which he was sacked.</p> <p>Eventually, he landed a job with McKinsey management consultants in Indonesia. Posted to London as part of a development programme, he opted for a short project, initiated by the Prince of Wales in his capacity as president of Business in the Community, on how to improve dire exam results in inner-city London. Wigdortz, having visited several schools and concluded that \"educational inequality was the biggest social issue in the country\", came up with the Teach First idea. He had never managed or started anything before, but found himself leading a team to get it off the ground. Shouldn't he then have handed over to a native? \"I would have if anybody had come along. I took six months' leave from McKinsey and it never entered my head that I wouldn't go back. But nobody else really believed in the project.\" He is now a British citizen with a British wife and three small children and, he assures me, \"it wouldn't enter my head to send them to a private school\".</p> <p>Teach First ticks all boxes for success. Ofsted rates it \"outstanding\" on 11 out of 11 criteria. Schools welcome its recruits, even though they pay recruitment fees on top of salaries only slightly below those for newly qualified teachers. Those that recruit from Teach First get above-average improvements in results. It is hard not to admire Wigdortz's sincerity and dedication which, he says, derive partly from his Jewish faith. There is also a peculiarly American belief, laced with a deal of McKinsey management-speak, in an individual's capacity to change the world. \"He inspires the people who work with him to the same commitment,\" says Tim Brighouse, former chief adviser for London schools. Yet for all the idealism, Wigdortz needed hard-headed pragmatism to succeed. \"He's used some extremely effective lobbying techniques, which the education system hadn't really experienced before,\" says John Bangs, visiting fellow at Cambridge University and a former teachers' union official. Though he campaigned for Bill Clinton in 1992, Wigdortz carefully avoids taking positions on anything remotely controversial politically, such as businesses running schools.</p> <p>Yet Teach First has critics. Jonathan Savage, reader in education at Manchester Metropolitan University, calculates that it costs taxpayers 66% more per graduate than the conventional PGCE route, though this doesn't take account of schools' savings on fully qualified teachers when they have trainees on staff.</p> <p>The scheme is also accused of elitism. Wigdortz, who now has 270 staff and an annual salary of \u00a3140,000 (roughly equal to what he got as a McKinsey junior a decade ago, he points out), insists that humility and respect are among essential qualities sought from Teach First applicants during day-long tests and interviews. He adds that 16% come from ethnic minority backgrounds and 24% themselves qualified for free school meals or education maintenance allowances. But a study by academics at London Metropolitan University found recruits guilty of patronising middle-class attitudes: a belief that they, young teachers from posh universities, have much to offer but nothing to learn from low-income communities. \"There's a danger,\" says Bangs, \"that you have high-flyers parachuting in and out. If that's not so, they need to say it more loudly. These are fragile schools that need consistency. Emotional intelligence and empathy are as important as academic achievement.\"</p> <p>Wigdortz and his Teach First \"movement\" have become the poster boys and girls for the social mobility agenda, now embraced, at least in principle, by all three main parties. Britain, Wigdortz says, has one of the highest correlations in the developed world between children's educational attainment and their parents' income. I reply that his native America has an equally high correlation and both countries also have high levels of poverty and inequality. The education gap may be impossible to close significantly while inequality is so high and, in any case, social mobility does not itself eradicate poverty. On the contrary, it may legitimise it.</p> <p>Isn't poverty the true and more urgent source of injustice? \"Poverty is a huge issue,\" Wigdortz replies. \"It's complex and multi-faceted. There's no silver bullet. There are tens of thousands of children out there who don't have access to certain roles in society. Should we just give up on them? We have to do something.\"</p>",
  "<p>A year after the violent death of Muammar Gaddafi, debate still rages about Libya's 2011 revolution. Was it worth it? Or will Gaddafi's overthrow lead to a second Iraq? Optimists say that despite the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/12/chris-stevens-us-ambassador-libya-killed?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">recent murder of the US ambassador in Benghazi</a>, Libya could in time be a success story. For the pessimists, though, the country is already a mess: the central government is weak; armed militias roam with impunity; fighting resumed this month around the loyalist town of Bani Walid. In the east of the country is the spectre of radical Islam.</p> <p>In a series of extraordinary portraits from the new Libya, the photojournalist Louis Quail sets out to provide some answers. His starting points are Libyans themselves \u2013 the taxi-driver who joined the revolution and photographed Gaddafi's dying moments on his iPhone;&#xa0;a mother grieving for her martyred son; a honeymoon couple visiting Misrata, one of the bastions of resistance to the regime, the bride decked out in a full concealing veil. There is a female politician from Benghazi and a group of brave women from a Tripoli suburb who handed out anti-Gaddafi fliers \u2013 an act of resistance punishable by imprisonment and rape.</p> <p>Quail's conclusions are surprisingly affirming. Despite the deaths of loved ones \u2013 sons, brothers, cousins, friends \u2013 Libyans remain hopeful that their country can be a better place, and that the revolutionary idealism of 2011 can prevail. The challenge, they recognise, is to unlearn old mental habits: \"Within many Libyan brains you will find a mini Gaddafi,\" one Libyan tells Quail, acknowledging the legacies of 42 years of dictatorship. He adds: \"He is still in our subconscious. I feel it's going to get better but we need time, a long time.\"</p> <p>Quail visited Libya for three weeks in June, just before the country's first election since 1965. (T<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/10/muslim-brotherhood-expectations-libyan-election?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">he poll delivered victory for moderates rather than Islamists</a>, but the subsequent political process has partly broken down.) He says he set out to shoot pictures that were \"more reflective\" and \"quieter\" than typical news images. He has two favourites. One is of a woman, Marim al Bosafi, whose son Hamsa was shot dead in September 2011. She has kept his room the same: \"She goes up there every day, touches and smells his things \u2026 Nobody can replace the boy-sized hole left in that woman's heart. You can see a soft toy in the corner he had as a boy.\"</p> <p>The other is of a rebel soldier with a gun in his hand.</p> <p>To his credit, Quail also sought out the revolution's losers. He talked to imprisoned Gaddafi fighters. He recorded the spot where many had died. And he travelled to Tawerga, a Gaddafi-loyalist town just down the road from revolutionary Misrata. After the fall of Tripoli, rebels burned down all of Tawerga's houses, forcing those left behind to flee. A photo shows a rusting car in an alley of abandoned houses \u2013 a strange urban landscape bereft of life. The rebels knew this violence was wrong. But they were unable to stop themselves; one wrote on a wall: \"Sorry Osama [the local leader] I couldn't control myself.\"</p> <p>Gaddafi's overthrow, of course, was only possible because of Nato's assistance: UK and French warplanes bombed his troops, and last October targeted his convoy, forcing him to seek refuge in a storm drain. It was from here that he was captured, beaten and shot. Quail says most Libyans are grateful for Nato's help, and adds that without it the country would be \"the same as Syria\", in the grip of an inconclusive and murderous civil war. He adds that most of those whom he met were \"very moderate Muslims\". \"They were so courageous \u2026 In Misrata I came across dentists, lawyers, who had taught themselves how to fight. At the end of the day they went out to protect their families as much as anything.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Libya: Murder in Benghazi and the Fall of Gaddafi by Martin Chulov and Luke Harding is published this week as an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/info/2012/oct/19/muammar-gaddafi-libya\">ebook by Guardian Books, price \u00a32.99</a>.</em></p>",

  "<p>It will now publish Fifty Shades of Grey and Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov; Pippa Middleton's recipe and craft book and Nigella Lawson's latest cookbook. Penguin, the most famous name in British publishing, has confirmed its merger with the German-owned Random House, creating the biggest book publisher seen, accounting for about one in four of all books sold.</p> <p>But the news immediately unsettled some in the industry, which has already seen thousands of bookshops close as readers increasingly turn to Amazon for printed and now electronic books.</p> <p>Andrew Franklin, founder of Profile Books, publisher of titles including Lynne Truss's Eats, Shoots and Leaves, said the deal was a \"great shame\" for publishing, and predicted that Penguin would lose its separate identity. \"The myth is when you combine two great companies you get one even greater company,\" he said. \"This will end up a complete takeover of Penguin.</p> <p>\"It isn't by chance that every Tesco looks the same. [Big publishers] love to promote diversity and localism, but that's not how it works.\"</p> <p>Authors' representatives were more optimistic. Kate Pool, deputy secretary general of the Society of Authors, said that if the new venture delivered on its promises to continue to invest in content and titles at its current levels, then authors had nothing to fear.</p> <p>\"If they keep their promises then it could well be that at the coalface it doesn't feel that different to the average author. If publishers are struggling because the sands are shifting then they need reinforce what they have always done well \u2013 good rights deals, good advances.</p> <p>\"Given all the other upheavals confronting the publishing industry, this is just a drop in the ocean.\"</p> <p>Founded by Allen Lane in 1935 to popularise reading with cut-price books aimed at the general reader, Penguin's 77-year independent history came to an end after five months of behind-the-scenes talks involving both corporations. The merged company, to be called Penguin Random House, will be a joint venture in which Bertelsmann, a media conglomerate controlled by the Mohn family, will retain a 53% stake. Pearson, which also owns the Financial Times, will retain the balance, with the two sides pledging to stick together for at least three&#xa0;years.</p> <p>The company will have \u00a32.5bn in revenues and almost \u00a3175m in profits.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Franklin did not believe that the creation of such a dominant force would crush independent players, who account for about 44% of the market in the UK. \"When you have really huge companies, paradoxically you leave more room for smaller, nimble players,\" he said. \"Look at the film and music industry. It is often the big players struggling, not the independents.\"</p> <p>John Makinson, Penguin's chief executive, who will head the new company's board, said the rationale behind doubling in size was to help both publishers make the transition from printed word to ebook.</p> <p>Amazon is now selling 114 ebooks for every 100 printed books, helped by the popularity of its Kindle. \"We are all worried, as the world moves to a more digital structure for content and distribution, that publishing could diminish, fewer books be published and fewer risks taken,\" said Makinson. \"We hope to be able to offer more to readers and authors.</p> <p>\"This will give us resources, capacity and confidence to publish a broad array [of content] and to take risks. That is what good publishing is about.\"</p> <p>Pearson also rejected a last-minute, tentative proposal from Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corp owns rival publisher HarperCollins, in part due to the fact that an outright sale of Penguin has tax implications in the US, where it has two-thirds of its business.</p> <p>Penguin Random House will be run by Markus Dohle, chairman and chief executive of Random House Worldwide. It was not clear what would happen to other high-profile publishing executives, not least Dame Gail Rebuck, the chairman and chief executive of Random House. Both companies promised more details in the coming weeks.</p> <p>The two owners are confident that though they will control more than 25% of the global book market, regulators will clear the deal. In Britain, the two groups' market share is closer to 30%.</p>",
  "<p>High noon on 12 September 2012 marked a moving and historic occasion. The<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-disaster-inquest-prosecutions-report\" title=\"\"> Hillsborough report </a>was published, and the city and citizens of Liverpool were finally vindicated after 23 years. The euphoria that erupted on the streets was immediate, pervasive and infectious: the identity and integrity of the city and its people had been restored.</p> <p>We owe it to the 96 people who died at Hillsborough, their families, and all those who have been so badly wronged, to ensure that the lessons and enduring legacy of the football stadium disaster are enshrined in a fundamental change to our forms of governance. Hillsborough was never just about the safety of football fans; itrevealed a serious systemic malaise that subverts the wellbeing of our civic society. Put simply, how could the truth have become corrupted so badly, by so many, for so long?</p> <p>The judicial system in its various forms; the prosecutorial authorities, a coroner and three different high court judges had failed to uncover the depth and breadth of malpractice.</p> <p>These same questions have been rapidly rising to the surface in a number of other arenas. Currently they concern the disclosures about Jimmy Savile, the BBC, the NHS, prison and school authorities. Earlier in the year it was the revelations in the Leveson inquiry about unhealthy collusion between politicians, the police and the tabloids.Previous inquiries have grappled with matters of equal significance: the murder of Stephen Lawrence, the sinking of the Marchioness, Bloody Sunday, David Kelly's death by Hutton and the legality of the Iraq war by Chilcot.</p> <p>It is of note that in each of these examples the impetus for an inquiry did not come from the system itself but from the families and friends of the victims. They faced hostility, vilification and rejection at the start, but their prodigious persistence and courage prevailed. Their efforts reflect a very real public disenchantment and lack of confidence in our established forms of governance. Transparency is not credible. Accountability is non-existent. Not exactly surprising after the machinations by members of the House of Commons over expenses, cash for questions and access.</p> <p>The time for fundamental and radical change is long overdue. There is now an urgent need for a popular mechanism of independent oversight, a permanent \"truth commission\" rather than periodic, ad hoc public inquiries.</p> <p>Such a concept is not without precedent. When David Cameron introduced the Hillsborough report, he added that \"we have had truth, let justice follow\". This was universally endorsed and echoed the sentiments of an earlier Tory Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, who in 1851 coined the phrase \"Justice is truth in action\". An admirable vision, but one which has yet to be realised.</p> <p>In the meantime, the report on Hillsborough may well have thrown up a compelling model for the future. An independent panel of experts, chaired by the bishop of Liverpool, was established to oversee the discovery, collation and categorisation of material. Importantly, the panel was not merely assembling information but was empowered to assess the extent to which it added to the public understanding of events.</p> <p>This dimension was vital, because it enabled the panel to form conclusions about the whole picture. The exercise was carried out expeditiously under conditions of utmost confidentiality. The scrutiny was intense and thorough. There were no advance leaks and no external pressures brought to bear on its deliberations. The report was compiled with clarity and precision.</p> <p>Herein lies the seeds of something new. There are plenty of international precedents for such a body. Between 1974 and 1994 there were 15, mostly in South America and Africa. In the aftermath of apartheid, the famous Truth and Reconciliation Commission held hearings under the guiding hand of archbishop Desmond Tutu.</p> <p>Alongside these, there has also been a growth of people's tribunals set up by civil society itself, reflecting its frustration at the inactivity of government and inter-governmental institutions. Started by Bertrand Russell during the Vietnam war, the <a href=\"http://www.russelltribunalonpalestine.com/en/\" title=\"\">Russell tribunal on Palestine</a> has been reconstituted over the last two years to deal with Israel's persistent violations of international law; two weeks ago the fourth session concluded with an address to the UN.</p> <p>Coincidentally, another initiative with similar objectives has been unfolding in the Peace Palace in the Hague, home of the International Court of Justice. Emigre Iranians established an <a href=\"http://irantribunal.com/Eng/Documents/Court-hearings-1.html\" title=\"\">independent truth commission and tribunal</a> into the atrocities inflicted by the Islamic Revolutionary government between 1981 and 1988. They did this because their plight had not been acknowledged, let alone redressed by any official judicial forum. A hundred witnesses gave evidence before expert commissioners and a panel of international jurists who passed judgment on 27 October. It spelt out incontrovertible and extensive human rights violations and crimes against humanity committed by the Iranian regime.</p> <p>None of these commisions should have to have been undertaken or instigated by the victims themselves. Without 23 years of continuous painful pressure by the Hillsborough families there would be no truth, let alone justice. A permanent independent standing commission must now be created to monitor and investigate systemic abuse.</p>",
  "<p>Islamist rebels will attack Mali's capital city if international military intervention is launched to regain control of the country's north, a senior member of an insurgent group closely linked to al-Qaida has told the Guardian .</p> <p>Oumar Ould Hamaha, head of security for the Movement for Tawhid and Jihad in West Africa (Mujao) claimed that rebels have recruited thousands of new fighters and warned that intervention would galvanise the international jihadist movement.</p> <p>\"If an international or Malian military force attacks us, we will take Bamako in 24 hours,\" Hamaha said in a telephone interview. \"The international community is slow to strike because it knows that if it does, it will spark a worldwide jihad.</p> <p>\"Plans for a military intervention do not diminish in any way our determination to promote jihad,\" Hamaha added. \"We are convinced that with the help of Allah we will defeat any army coming. We have the support of the local people, and we have people from all parts of Africa coming to join us. We are ready to die.\"</p> <p>The defiant rhetoric from Mujao \u2013 which together with al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Ansar Dine control the northern two-thirds of Mali, including military bases, airports and several towns \u2013 came as US secretary of state Hillary Clinton arrived in Algeria to rally support for intervention.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the UN security council adopted a resolution underscoring its \"readiness\" to send an international force to drive Islamists out of northern Mali, setting a deadline at the end of next month for a firm plan for military action. Mali is working on plans involving troops from the Mali army and west Africa regional bloc ECOWAS, with training, logistics and intelligence support from France, the US and other countries.</p> <p>But military action would probably require the support of Algeria, which initially opposed intervention. The country shares an 2,000km desert border with Mali \u2013 seen as a key route for illicit trade of arms and drugs in and out of Mali \u2013 while many insurgents fighting in northern Mali are reported to be of Algerian origin.</p> <p>\"There is a strong recognition that Algeria has to be a central part of the solution,\" said a US official, who added that the situation in northern Mali would be a \"central focus\" of Clinton's talks with the Algerian president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika.</p> <p>The role of the US in combatting AQIM in northern Mali has been a source of controversy in recent weeks. Hamaha told the Guardian the Mujao was aware that US surveillance drones were operating regularly in the region already, and that the unmanned aircraft were having the effect of encouraging support for the Islamist cause in northern Mali.</p> <p>\"We see drones passing overhead all the time. This is not something we take seriously \u2013 we are not afraid of drones. On the contrary, by trying to intimidate us, the west is only sharpening the sword we will use against it.\"</p> <p>Experts said rebel threats to attack southern parts of Mali could not be discounted. \"I think the claims about Bamako are mostly posturing, but we cannot rule out the possibility of attacks outside of northern Mali,\" said Andrew Lebovich, a researcher on the Sahel and north Africa. \"AQIM and Mujao have operated beyond the confines of northern Mali in the past, and these groups do have the capability to stage attacks elsewhere, although it would be difficult given the attention on these groups at the moment.\"</p> <p>Hamaha said that there were no prospects of negotiation.</p> <p>\"We don't recognise any government in Bamako,\" Hamaha added. \"The minister of defence called me to talk about negotiating towards a secular state. I told him it's sharia or the sword. No sharia, no dialogue. Our mission is straight. There is no negotiation to be had.\"</p> <p>The Mali government refused to comment on the status of its negotiations with the groups, but the head of the EU delegation in Mali said that negotiations were still considered a potential alternative to conflict in northern Mali.</p> <p>\"No one is talking about military intervention as if it is the end of the track,\" said Bertrand Soret, EU charg\u00e9d'affaires in Mali. \"We have been pushing for dual track approach \u2013 negotiations and building up military force. We are not recommending talking to terrorists, but we are pushing for the Malian authorities to deal with some of the groups from their side.\"</p>",
  "<p>A transgender Sikh comes to terms with a vagina, a Maharashtrian motorcycling champion tells of her hidden sexuality, and an unwitting lesbian is drawn into the Mumbai underworld.</p> <p>Until three years ago, homosexuality was illegal in India and stories like these about the lives of queer Indians remained largely untold. Now, emboldened by legal recognition and a growing gay-rights movement, queer Indians are starting to speak up. Threats from religious activists against Salman Rushdie <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/20/salman-rushdie-jaipur-literary-festival\" title=\"\">prompted him to pull out of India's biggest literature festival</a> earlier this year but the event's first panel on queer writing barely raised an eyebrow.</p> <p>Since then an anthology of queer erotica has hit the shelves, HarperCollins India has published a <a href=\"http://harpercollins.co.in/BookDetail.asp?Book_Code=3281\" title=\"\">novel with a gay protagonist</a>, and this month sees the release of Out! Stories from the New Queer India, an anthology of 30 contemporary stories about being queer and Indian from publisher Shobhna Kumar and editor Minal Hajratwala, both lesbians of Indian descent. \"For 20 years since I came out I've been reading every single thing I can get my hands on that's queer and Indian, even marginally so, you know even just a hint of queer in there,\" laughs Hajratwala, who lives in the US.</p> <p>\"When we got the first round of submissions in I thought, 'Wow, I have never seen this kind of thing before; the characters are totally different.' I don't think the story of how a Sikh mother feels about her son becoming her daughter has ever been told.\"</p> <p>The stories span gender identities, classes and cultures and some are translated from regional languages such as Tamil. One tells a wife's story of finding out her business executive husband is bisexual and HIV positive, another is about the suicide of a lesbian couple in a rural village. A third sees two female <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werecat\" title=\"\">were-lions</a> (think werewolves) with henna tattoos falling in love in the bath.</p> <p>Queer writing was published in India before section 377 of the Indian penal code \u2013 a colonial law banning homosexuality \u2013 was overturned in 2009. But the tone of these new stories is very different says Kumar, who began her company Queer Ink by posting imported gay novels to customers in brown paper envelopes. \"After 377, writers feel a lot more empowered to write their stories \u2013 even if some remain anonymous,\" she explains. \"They're saying: 'I'm here, I'm queer, and there's nothing wrong with that.' They are not victims.\"</p> <p>The legal change has not transformed social attitudes overnight, and many groups still oppose the judgment. But the vast amount of media coverage that accompanied decriminalisation did drag discussions of homosexuality from the taboo to the mainstream. \"Dinner-table discussions probably include the words lesbian and gay now,\" says Kumar.</p> <p>Stories of lesbians in particular have come to the fore in recent years as women's social situation has shifted. \"As the economy in India has changed, more women are working and have an independent income \u2013 some are living in the city by themselves,\" says Hajratwala. \"There's a new scope for sexual agency that would not have been there maybe a generation ago.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, it took Kumar six months to protect the authors by ensuring that legal responsibility for a book's content lies with the publisher, not the individual authors, if the work is deemed offensive under India's indecency laws. Many still chose to remain anonymous.</p> <p>\"It's a really exciting time in India to be queer and to be part of that movement,\" says Hajratwala. \"Every book is an artefact of its time, and this is real, tangible evidence that a vibrant queer community in India exists.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Out!

  "<p>Towards the end of the set, a sweat-swamped Brian King hunches over the microphone and makes reference to the other big rock show happening in London tonight. \"Muse can keep their light shows and their fuckin' fireworks,\" the frontman hollers, having noted the disparity between the groups' respective budgets. \"<em>We</em> have a drum solo from David Prowse.\"</p> <p>Hailing from Vancouver, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/2008d65c-31ee-4382-8960-5188523568d5\" title=\"\">Japandroids</a> number only drummer Prowse and guitarist King, sharing vocal duties between them. On record, studio magic steps in to conjure up the extra guitar parts and gang-harmonies that embolden their muscular anthems; with those elements absent tonight, the duo make up the shortfall by cranking King's guitar up as loud as the venue will allow, revelling in the resulting feedback and din, and by attacking their songs with a desperate and lustful vigour that lends a chaotic vibe that's electrifying.</p> <p>Their lineup might be minimal; their ear-ringing sound is anything but. Within seconds of King's opening yell of \"Let's fuckin' go!\", they have whipped up an effortlessly melodic, full-throated rumble-tumble that recalls the caustic pell-mell pop of H\u00fcsker D\u00fc: bellow-along charmers such as The Boys Are Leaving Town and Fire's Highway bolt past at perfect pogo velocity, a stream of crowd-surfers in constant commute between stage and mosh pit throughout.</p> <p>King and Prowse play their rock'n'roll like a high-wire act, sounding ever on the edge of falling apart, flirting with chaos and collapse, just on the right side of din and derangement. Their commendably unhinged cover of the Gun Club's For the Love of Ivy closes the night, King commanding the mosh pit to hold a hand-selected stage-diver aloft throughout its duration, and aping the riffs from AC/DC's Thunderstruck and Smashing Pumpkins' Today between verses. There were no light shows and no fireworks and, to be frank, they weren't remotely missed; Japandroids' slaloming, hurtling, bruised and tuneful noise satisfies on its own terms.</p> <p><em>What have you been to see lately?

  "<p>Thirty people <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/29/climate-activists-west-burton-gas\" title=\"\">shut down the UK's newest gas-fired power station and 15 occupied two of its chimneys</a> at West Burton in Nottinghamshire this morning.

We have also carried up enough supplies to keep us up here for at least a week.</p> <p>It's pretty scary hanging inside the chimney on a portaledge, but we've been rigorously trained and have some very skilled climbers as part of our group. We've made a cosy camp with tarpaulins, and we plan to share a hot meal this evening at the same time as our friends across on the other chimney. The view up here is beautiful.

The chimney makes weird noises which jolted everyone awake several times last night but I'm sure we'll get used to it.</p> <p>Making our home on top of a power station in October may seem like a strange thing to do, but we've thought long and hard about it, and we are here for very serious reasons. We're aware that as we sit here surveying the horizon, the east coast of the US is being devastated by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-news-blog/2012/oct/29/hurricane-sandy-new-york-live-blog\" title=\"\">Hurricane Sandy</a>. These two things are inextricably connected.</p> <p>We're doing this because the gas plant, which is still being constructed by its operator, EDF, is one of the first in a new dash for gas that has to be stopped. The government and the big energy companies want to build as many as 20 new gas power stations, which would leave the UK dependent on this highly polluting and increasingly expensive fuel for decades to come.</p> <p>Last week <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-20093259\" title=\"\">EDF hiked its energy prices by 10.8%</a>, the highest rise of any of the big six energy companies so far this winter. These price rises were triggered by the rising wholesale cost of gas, which the UK is increasingly forced to import as North Sea supplies decline. We already rely on gas for <a href=\"http://www.consumerfocus.org.uk/files/2011/10/Off-gas-consumers.pdf\" title=\"\">83% of our central heating</a> and <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/11/stats/publications/dukes/2307-dukes-2011-chapter-5-electricity.pdf\" title=\"\">almost 50%</a> of electricity. Increasing this dependence will cause household energy bills to rise even further, pushing those who live the most precarious lives deeper into fuel poverty.</p> <p>By occupying the site and halting construction we hope, for however short a time, to stop this dash for gas and expose the madness of a government that is totally in the thrall of the big energy companies. Intense lobbying by some of the most powerful polluters in the world is eroding even the modest gains made by democratic attempts to shape our energy policy, which culminated in the 2008 Climate Change Act. Over the past five years, direct action campaigns have played a key role in forcing government U-turns around major environmental decisions \u2013 think of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/13/protesters-tamsin-omond-plane-stupid\" title=\"\">Plane Stupid</a> campaign against Heathrow's third runway and the shift away from coal after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2010/dec/16/ratcliffe-trial\" title=\"\">occupation at Kingsnorth</a>. Now, the government's climate advisers, the independent Committee on Climate Change, are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/13/uk-dash-gas-illegal-climate-committee\" title=\"\">warning that a dash for gas could be illegal</a>, causing the UK to miss the already relatively unambitious emissions reduction targets laid out in the Climate Change Act.</p> <p>With a quarter of the UK's outdated energy infrastructure needing to be replaced, properly supported investment in renewables could generate hundreds of thousands of jobs, radically cut emissions of carbon dioxide and stabilise energy bills.</p> <p>We also have an opportunity to restructure our relationship with energy production through community control. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/30/germany-renewable-energy-revolution\" title=\"\">In Germany</a> 65% of renewables are owned by individuals or communities, while in the UK the figure is less than 10%. With each passing day the need to take radical action to address the linked problems of climate change and increasing inequality grows stronger.</p> <p>We believe that another future is possible \u2013 one that puts the needs of people and the environment ahead of big corporations and profit. That's why we're camped out at the top of these 80-metre chimneys, because history has shown us time and time again the need to go beyond the law when it is failing the people it is meant to nurture and protect.</p>",
  "<p>Ministers have ordered an independent review into how 5,000 patients were sectioned in the last decade without proper approval, it emerged today .</p> <p>Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, said he would have to put through \"emergency retrospective legislation\" after it was found that in four areas of the NHS in England - Yorkshire and Humberside, north east, east Midlands and west Midlands - \"2,000 doctors were not properly approved, and that they have participated in the detention of between 4,000 and 5,000 current patients\".</p> <p>He said patients were affected in institutions including Rampton high-secure hospital and Ashworth high-secure hospital.</p> <p>Hunt said there was \"no suggestion that the hospitalisation or detention of any patient has been clinically inappropriate\" and all the doctors were qualified to section patients. The errors relate to how parts of the NHS delegate responsibility for detaining patients under the mental health act.</p> <p>Hunt stressed that his decisions would not \"deprive people of their normal rights to seek redress if they have been detained for any other reason apart from the narrow issue of the delegation of authority\".</p> <p>A patient can only be sectioned if two doctors and a mental health professional agree it is necessary. Under the mental health act, doctors who assess patients have to be approved by the secretary of state. This \"approval\" has since 2002 have been made by NHS Strategic Health Authorities (SHAs).</p> <p>However, four out of the 10 SHAs in England asked mental health trusts to carry out the validation and approval process for them - and neglected to get those decisions referred back to them for final confirmation. It is this error that needs to be addressed urgently, said Hunt - who also ordered an independent review.</p> <p>Hunt said he had asked Dr Geoffrey Harris, chairman of NHS South (of England) and former chairman of Buckinghamshire Mental Health NHS Trust, to undertake an independent review to look \"at how this responsibility was delegated by these four SHAs\".</p> <p>He added: \"It is imperative that this review is swift and I've asked Dr Harris to report to me by the end of the year.\"</p> <p>Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said Labour supported the government's decision for a review. \"Detaining people under the Mental Health Act raises the most serious issues of fundamental rights and of patient and public safety. Any reported failure will therefore always be a matter of the highest concern.</p> <p>\"There will be concerns about precedent - this the first time that the House has been presented with emergency legislation in this area which affects people's rights. The public will want to know that it is being used in exceptional circumstances as a last resort, not as a convenient means of correcting administrative failures.\"</p>",

But the conditions of the humans sent to catch them has had less attention.</p> <p>Late on Monday a gangmaster company which provided teams of migrant workers to dozens of large chicken farms in a chain that supplies premium free range eggs to McDonald's, Tesco, Asda and M&amp;S, \"Woodland\" eggs to Sainsbury's, and the Freedom Food and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QOR2w4H58s\" title=\"\">Happy Eggs</a> brands to leading retailers had its licence revoked with immediate effect by the Gangmaster Licensing Authority (GLA).</p> <p>The action followed a joint operation earlier this month by Kent police, the GLA and the Serious Organised Crime Agency to liberate more than 30 Lithuanian workers who are alleged to have been trafficked in to the UK. They are said to have then been kept in debt bondage, forced to work up to 17 hours a shift, bussed to farms the length of the country to catch hens through the night, sleeping for days at a time only in vans, in some weeks not paid at all, and, according to workers' testimony, kept under control by Lithuanian enforcers with threats of violence and on occasions actual physical assault.</p> <p>A 52-year-old man and a 50-year-old woman from the company, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were arrested in a dawn raid on a Grade II listed house in Kent on suspicion of human trafficking for the purposes of labour exploitation. They were later released on bail, whose terms included a ban on them contacting the workers, pending further inquiries. The gangmaster company is a member of Freedom Food, the welfare scheme licensed by the RSPCA. Six dogs, including some fighting breeds, which the migrants claim were used to intimidate them, were taken from a separate property into the care of a local branch of the RSPCA.</p> <p>The migrants, who as EU nationals are legally entitled to work in the UK, were transferred to a reception centre by the UK Human Trafficking Centre where those who wanted it were given support by the Salvation Army.</p> <p>The gangmaster business supplied workers to Noble Foods, one of the UK's largest processors of eggs and chickens. Noble is currently promoting its happy eggs on primetime television with an advert that shows its hens leaping for joy to the Olympian soundtrack of Chariots of Fire.</p> <p>The number of people being trafficked into the UK has been rising, according to a report published last week by the government's Inter-departmental Ministerial Group. Nearly a thousand suspected victims of human trafficking were referred to the National Referral mechanism in 2011, compared to just over 700 the previous year. Trafficking for labour exploitation is a significant and growing category, accounting for nearly a quarter of all cases. Extreme exploitation in the supply chain of major fast food names and leading supermarkets remains a serious problem, according to the GLA. Austerity across Europe, and retailers squeezing costs to counter inflation in food, have created the conditions for it to thrive. The GLA head of operations for the south-east, Neil Court, said exploitation among Lithuanians and other eastern Europeans appeared to be increasing, and in other cases the authority has seen a rise in organised crime, including fraud, money laundering, tax evasion and violence associated with labour abuse. The GLA has, however, had its budget for enforcement and inspection slashed by nearly one-fifth by the coalition government.</p> <p>Court said the allegations in the case involving the chicken catching gangs were \"probably some of the worst I have come across in my time at the GLA\".</p> <p>The workers said they had been charged a fee of around \u00a3350 for what they had been promised back in Lithuania were good jobs. \u00a350 a week was then deducted from their wages each week, so they were debt bonded on arrival. They allege they would be told to bring food to last five days and were then bussed around the country from job to job, from Monday to Friday, sometimes being driven for five or six hours at a time between farms before working a night shift. They were put to work without training or safety equipment, having to learn on the job how to catch four chickens in each hand before crating them. Without face masks, they found the smell and dust in the sheds was often overwhelming. They described not even knowing where they were going, but trying to find out from the GPS system at the front of the minivan. They claim they were refused toilet stops on journeys and that in between jobs they were kept for hours in the vans at roadside parking places.</p> <p>When they were brought back to their accommodation in Kent at weekends, they reported living 15 men to a small house in damp, squalid conditions. Mattresses on the floor were infested with bed bugs and fleas. They say they had \u00a340 a week deducted from their wages for the privilege of being bitten as soon as the lights were out.</p> <p>Those workers who wanted to open bank accounts or apply for national insurance numbers say they were told they couldn't and were threatened with the sack if they complained. When they were paid, it was by cheque, so they were forced to cash their wages at a local branch of the Money Shop where the charges are \u00a32.50 for registration, a \u00a33.99 flat fee for each cheque plus a 7.99% service fee, meaning that they could lose another \u00a312 from a \u00a3100 cheque.</p> <p>The most serious allegations from the workers relate to the climate of fear and violence in which they say they were kept. They have described Lithuanian enforcers used by the gangmasters to keep them under control with physical and verbal abuse. They have reported workers being beaten, punched, given black eyes and broken ribs, and then beaten again if they complained. One recalled first meeting one of the enforcers a couple of days after arriving in the UK, when the enforcer is said to have kicked the door of their house in and shouted to them that no one was getting paid that week. Others have said that their wages were withheld on several occasions for random reasons: a dirty cup left in the kitchen, or the smell of alcohol on someone's breath on a day off.</p> <p>In revoking the company's licence to operate with immediate effect, the GLA listed breaches of licence terms on an unprecedented scale. The gangmaster has the right of appeal.</p> <p>At the gangmasters' period property when the Guardian accompanied police on their raid, several luxury vehicles were parked in front of a green oak barn. A top-of-the-range motor home sat alongside two new Range Rovers. A decorative wooden shelter next to the gate was stocked with eggs for sale in free range and Freedom Food boxes with an \"honesty box\" in which passersby could post the money for them.</p> <p>The labour-providing business supplied workers to Noble Foods, which contracts farmers to produce premium high welfare eggs which it then packs at a rate of 4m a day and supplies to McDonald's and the leading retailers. It specialises in brands and products which claim to meet high ethical standards. Its own brands include The Happy Egg Company, GoldenLay Omega 3 Free Range Eggs, Big and Fresh, Free Range Egg for Soldiers and Gu puddings. On its website it claims: \"Concern for bird welfare runs throughout Noble's activities. The care with which we handle day old chicks is matched by our treatment of hens at the end of their laying life. Utilising a widespread Freedom Food approved national catching and collection network, our dedicated fleet of GPS tracked modular collection vehicles deliver directly into our abattoir and butchery operation.\"</p> <p>Processors typically take responsibility for contracting labour to catch chickens for immunisation, for transferring to different sheds as they grow or for slaughter.</p> <p>When asked what measures it took to ensure standards for workers as opposed to the hens in its supply chain, it said in a statement: \"Noble Foods is one of many companies within the poultry industry that has used [this gangmaster]. After being notified of the action taken by Kent police we immediately ceased using this organisation. As the police investigation is ongoing it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.\"</p> <p>The Guardian asked the gangmasters to comment on the allegations but they too declined because of the police investigation.</p> <p>McDonald's also declined to comment and referred us to Noble Foods. A Tesco spokesperson said: \"As a founder member of the Ethical Trading Initiative, we are committed to decent working conditions on all the farms and factories in our supply chain. These allegations are clearly shocking. We will continue to work closely with the GLA, our suppliers and others to ensure good practice throughout the sector.\" The other retailers also said that they took the allegations very seriously and were co-operating with the enforcement agencies.</p> <p>The RSPCA's Freedom Food company said individual licence holders were responsible for ensuring animal welfare. There are no specific labour standards in its licence terms, but where a member does anything which would bring Freedom Food or the RSPCA into disrepute then the membership agreement makes provision for suspending or cancelling a business's membership. \"Should these shocking allegations regarding workers prove to be true then Freedom Food would enact this provision,\" it said.</p>",

  "<p>Nick Clegg has accused the defence secretary, Philip Hammond, of \"jumping the gun\" on Trident as Hammond visited Faslane to announce a further \u00a3350m investment to underline his support for a fresh generation of British nuclear-armed submarines.</p> <p>Liberal Democrats are angered at the way in which Hammond <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/29/tories-lib-dems-trident\" title=\"\">appears to be ruling out</a> any other option but full renewal of the current continuous-at-sea deterrent.</p> <p>A final decision is due to be by government made in 2016, but the coalition agreement sets out plans for a Lib Dem-led government study, based in the Cabinet Office, into alternatives.</p> <p>An angry Clegg said: \"The coalition agreement is crystal clear: it stands, it will not be changed, it will not be undermined, it will not be contradicted. The decision on the Trident replacement will not be taken until 2016, however much other people may not like it that way.</p> <p>\"And I think in the meantime what we need, as a country, is to have a considered, facts-based debate about what kind of deterrent we need in the future, what kind of deterrent we can afford in the future.</p> <p>\"Let's remember the idea of a like-for-like, entirely unchanged, replacement for Trident is basically saying we will spend billions and billions and billions of pounds on a nuclear missile system, designed for the sole strategic purpose of flattening Moscow at the press of a button.</p> <p>He added, referring to Hammond: \"Having seen the papers this morning, I think some people are jumping the gun on this Trident decision.\"</p> <p>Lib Dem officials also asked why Hammond appeared to have closed his mind to cheaper alternatives to Trident before the study, due to be completed next year, had been published.</p> <p>Hammond said: \"The government's position on this is very clear. We are committed to maintaining a continuous deterrent, based on the Trident missile.</p> <p>\"There was a vote in parliament in 2007 where there was an overwhelming majority for replacing the Vanguard submarines when they go out of service [in the 2020s].\"</p> <p>But Liberal Democrats said the terms of reference of the review, agreed by the previous defence secretary Liam Fox, clearly show alternatives to a submarine-based deterrent will be considered.A Liberal Democrat source said: \"The Conservatives are clearly wedded to a cold war replacement for Trident. The Liberal Democrats will make the case for an alternative. The Labour party has got to come clean [on] whether it supports Britain building a \u00a3100bn replacement.\" The Liberal Democrats recognise they could be potentially the only party going into the next election proposing some alternative to a fully fledged replacement.</p> <p>The review is being overseen by the Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander, and is seen as critical to making a practical and military case for an alternative.</p> <p>Both Liberal Democrats and Conservatives on Monday expressed disappointment at the decision of the Liberal Democrats to remove defence minister Nick Harvey from the Ministry of Defence, saying he had been central to the review.</p> <p>The former Conservative defence minister Gerald Howarth said he was astonished by the decision, and Lord Lee, a Liberal Democrat peer, said it would be advisable if Harvey was drafted into the review.</p> <p>The Hammond announcement was also designed to underline the importance of Faslane submarine base to the Scottish economy, and emphasise the folly of the Scottish Nationalists' opposition to Trident.</p> <p>Hammond said the submarine base generated about 6,500 jobs in the area and that a Scottish navy as proposed by the SNP would generate fewer.</p> <p>\"By the time we've finished transferring all the submarines to Falsane we'll have generated 8,000 jobs in the area, and frankly a Scottish navy would generate nothing like that number of jobs at Faslane. The Conservative party has always made it absolutely crystal clear that we believe the nuclear deterrent has been a formidable part of our defence armoury, and has helped to secure the peace, and indeed helped to end the cold war. We believe that a successor submarine is necessary; we believe that submarine-based nuclear deterrent is the most effective.\"</p> <p>Scottish deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon attacked the UK government for \"dumping\" weapons of mass destruction on Scotland, and said there is cross-party support for scrapping the renewal of Trident in the Scottish parliament.</p> <p>\"The vast amount of taxpayers' cash squandered by the UK government on designing the new Trident system during a period of austerity and cuts to services and benefits by the Tory-led coalition is a staggering waste of money,\" she said.</p>",

  "<p>Mark Clattenburg has long cut a precocious figure; in the best and worst senses of the word. First seen running the line in the rough, tough Northern League at the age of 18, he became a Football League referee at a then unprecedented 25 and made the prestigious Fifa list shortly after his 30th birthday.</p> <p>Still only 37 and now ranked among the world's foremost officials, Clattenburg openly enjoys the trappings of success. He has embraced the 21st century's \"look at me\" celebrity culture to the extent that, with his love of expensive sports cars, designer labels and artfully applied hair gel, he could easily be confused with the Premier League footballers he is paid to control.</p> <p>Born in Consett, County Durham, and brought up in the Northumberland town of Cramlington, Clattenburg is a Newcastle United fan whose allegiance prevents him from officiating at their matches. One of his proudest moments came six years ago when he refereed Alan Shearer's testimonial. It was the sort of occasion the schoolboy who had taken up officiating to earn his Duke of Edinburgh's Award and the young man who qualified as an electrician in the days before professional referees existed could barely have dreamt of.</p> <p>In recent years Clattenburg's \"matey\" refereeing style has, on occasion, created on-field sparks. Sometimes his casual, chatty approach towards the game's multimillionaire players works superbly, at others it raises hackles among a breed known for their sensitivity to being \"dis-respected\" and, on Sunday, it left him fighting to save his career.</p> <p>The truth or otherwise of accusations that Clattenburg aimed a racist insult at Chelsea's Mikel John Obi during Manchester United's 3-2 win at Stamford Bridge remains unknown but despite the staunch support of the referees' union, he is facing the most severe crisis of his professional life.</p> <p>Although very different from previous traumas, it is far from the first upheaval he has confronted in recent years. The divorced father of a young son, his private life has not always run smoothly while his stewardship of two electrical companies was beset by financial difficulties.</p> <p>Almost four years ago Clattenburg made headlines when his \u00a340,000 Black Porsche Boxster was vandalised outside his smart apartment in Lanesbrough Court, a gated complex in the affluent Newcastle suburb of Gosforth. A former girlfriend and business partner of the referee was subsequently arrested and questioned by police in connection with the incident.</p> <p>Earlier in 2008 he had been sacked by the Professional Game Match Officials board pending a probe into his business affairs following allegations that he owed \u00a360,000 as a result of a failed venture as the co-owner of an electrical company.</p> <p>In February 2009 Clattenburg was reinstated as a Select Group Referee on appeal but suspended for eight months from 6 August 2008 \u2013 the date of his original ban \u2013 for \"issues relating to his private and business affairs\". The Newcastle Evening Chronicle reported that Clattenburg's suspension was related partly to anonymous allegations of gambling, domestic violence and drug taking relayed to a senior PGMO official in an unsigned letter. Although the referee vehemently denied the claims, the governing body was duty bound to investigate complaints it has consistently refused to comment on.</p> <p>Mark Hughes was one of a number of managers who welcomed Clattenburg back saying he was a \"good referee\" and the game \"needed\" men of his talent but in December 2009 Hughes, then in charge of Manchester City, at least temporarily changed his mind. The Welshman was left furious after accusing Clattenburg of asking the City bench \"How do you work with Craig Bellamy all week?\" in a game against Bolton during which he sent the forward off for a second yellow card offence.</p> <p>In 2007 Clattenburg's judgment had been called, similarly, into question when, during a Merseyside derby, he seemed poised to issue Everton's Tony Hibbert with a yellow card before producing a red following a brief discussion with Liverpool's Steven Gerrard. Later in the game he failed to dismiss Liverpool's Dirk Kuyt for a two-footed waist-high lunge. He did not take charge of another match involving Everton until earlier this year and has yet to reappear at Goodison Park.</p> <p>Like every referee, Clattenburg has made his fair share of controversial decisions and there have, inevitably, been mistakes. Overall, though, a man dubbed \"absolutely fantastic\" by the Leeds United manager Neil Warnock \u2013 normally a scourge of match officials \u2013 has got far more decisions right than wrong.</p> <p>Identified as a high flyer by Fifa, he has been widely expected to be the English referring representative at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. At the London Olympics Clattenburg refereed the final between Brazil and Mexico, with his performance impressing Fifa and confirming PGMO's opinion that he ranks as one of their brightest talents. Whether or not he can emerge from the shadow cast by Chelsea's allegations remains to be seen.</p>",
  "<p>Have you seen the version of Death of a Salesman in which Willy gasses himself? Or the Streetcar Named Desire that happens to feature <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2003/dec/13/theatre.classics \">the shower scene from Psycho</a>? I saw the latter at the Berlin's Volksb\u00fchne back in 2003, but you're unlikely to see Willy take that particular way out any time soon. As the Wall Street Journal reported last week, the Arthur Miller estate has <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204076204578077072117046196.html?mod=googlenews_wsj \">withdrawn the rights from Australia's well respected Belvoir Street Theatre to stage the play</a> when it learned that the director was cutting the epilogue and ending the play with the hero's suicide.</p> <p>Miller was famously protective of his work when alive. When the Wooster Group wanted to use The Crucible for its legendary show <a href=\"http://www.thewoostergroup.org/twg/projects/lsd/index.html \">LSD (Just the High Points)</a>, an injunction was taken out to prevent them. The company resorted to using one-minute segments, which they were allowed to do under copyright law. Miller even went to see the production, although confessed himself baffled by the enthusiastic audience response.</p> <p>In a British theatre culture where the playwright has primacy and the text is considered sacred, mucking about with it is often considered a crime against art. When Simon Stephens's <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/9038474/The-Trial-of-Ubu-Hampstead-Theatre-review.html\">The Trial of Ubu</a> got its British premiere at Hampstead at the beginning of the year, several critics protested that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2008/jul/15/theatre.culture\">Katie Mitchell's</a> production deviated from the published text. Simon Stephens is a big boy, and fully capable of fighting the corner for his own text if he deemed it necessary. So we can only conclude that not only did he not object, but positively embraced Mitchell's staging.</p> <p>In fact a playwright who's alive and kicking is often far more willing to accept the idea that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatreblog/2012/may/09/german-theatre-dares-three-kingdoms\">a text is a suggestion of a performance</a> and doesn't have to determine the performance \u2013 far more so than those estates charged with protecting the legacies (and income stream) of dead playwrights. Protection too often means building a high wall around the work and putting up a hands-off sign on it. The Beckett estate is famous for its handcuffs approach, but while still alive Beckett was a theatrical pragmatist, one who was even prepared to bow to health and safety. During a production of <a href=\"http://www.english.fsu.edu/jobs/num01/Num1Pountney2.htm\">Happy Days</a> at the NT in 1976 Beckett cut a page of his own text when a malfunctioning parasol refused to burst into flames. It was Peggy Ashcroft who objected\u2014she had already learned the lines. </p> <p>Yes, plays need some protection from young directors with a big concept and a fledgling career to promote, but I reckon that we don't need the self-appointed artistic police out in the rehearsal rooms making arrests. Audiences are perfectly capable of distinguishing between the crazed and the creative. If Willy and Winnie are still going to be around in 100 years' time, then maybe estates need to relax their grip on the words and let the plays really live. As the Polish theatre guru <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/1999/jan/20/guardianobituaries \">Jerzy Grotowski</a> suggested when writing about Hamlet: \"The strength of each great work really exists in its catalytic effect. It opens doors.\"</p>",
  "<p>Tracey Owings is fighting hard to keep the home that has been in his family for 34 years. In 2000 his mother refinanced. In 2006 she died. In 2009 he lost his job and had no paid work for nine months. He fell behind with the mortgage. The bank moved to foreclose on the house. Gradually the work came back. Less than before. Much less. But just enough. The house is not in negative equity and now he can make the payments. But he can't get the bank to take his money. Attempts to modify the loan and take advantage of a settlement, brokered by the White House, between mortgage companies and the justice department have come to nought. \"I don't qualify,\" he says with exasperation detailing both his efforts to meet each bureaucratic challenge and his frustration at each bureaucratic obstacle.</p> <p>He stands in the waiting room of Gulfcoast Legal Services offices in Sarasota with an armful of documents and a belly full of bile. \"They have failed me,\" he says. \"Obama came in offering hope and change but he's failed. I just want to save my mother's house.\"</p> <p>Owings is voting for Mitt Romney. Does he think Romney will improve his lot? \"I'm willing to try anything at this point,\" he says.</p> <p>There is nothing more vexing to liberals than poor Republicans. Their very existence rankles. It turns their world on its head and their assumptions inside out. The effort to explain them is understood not just as a political paradox but a psychological disorder. They have been duped.

To many liberals these are turkeys voting for Christmas or lemmings off for a leap; the condemned tying the noose for their own execution.</p> <p>At times the contradictions are striking. In August 2009, when opponents of Obamacare were disrupting town hall meetings with claims of death panels, Kenneth Gladney and other members of St Louis tea party got into a fight with Democrats at a public meeting. He had to go to the emergency room with injuries to his knee, back, elbow, shoulder and face and ended up in a wheelchair. It turned out Gladney, <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2009/08/10/55408/gladney-uninsured/?mobile=nc\">who had recently been laid off</a>, had no health insurance. He appealed for donations.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/02/12/us/entitlement-map.html?ref=us\">Trace a map</a> highlighting government dependency and those most reliant on benefits live in Republican states and often Republican counties. In Floyd county in Eastern Kentucky, 40% of the income comes from the government. In 2008 Floyd, where almost 20% live below the poverty line and the median income is almost 20% lower than the country, voted for McCain \u2013 a 27 point swing against the Democrats and the first victory for Republicans in living memory.</p> <p>\"We're getting more and more \u00adpeople coming here as time goes by,\" Tom Price, who helps administer a food bank for the local church <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2010/jan/16/gary-younge-obama-first-year\">told me when I visited</a> just a year after Obama was elected. \"The bottom's just fallen out of it all \u2026 Is there a direct correlation [between Obama's victory and the region's bad times]?

The first thing to note is that <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#val=USP00p1\">most of them don't</a>. In 2008 73% of those who earned less than $15,000, 60% of those who earned between $15,000 and $30,000, and 55% of those who earned between $30,000 and $50,000 <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/154559/US-Presidential-Election-Center.aspx\">voted for Obama</a>. This year 57% of those earning less than $36,000 plan to vote Democrat as do 50% of those with a high school diploma or less. Even in deeply conservative Mississippi the overwhelming majority of the poor voted for Obama.</p> <p>Most of the clients I met in Sarasota's Gulf Coast legal centre struggling with the threat of repossession or foreclosure voted for Obama and will do so again. \"I'm for Obama all the way,\" says Betty-Jean Haines, the fate of whose home currently rests in the courts. \"He really wants to do something good but he's running into so many road blocks.\"</p> <p>The question of why poor people vote Republican is not simply an issue of income but primarily race and partly region and gender. Poor people may be more likely to vote Democrat; poor white people are not. In 2008 McCain won a slim majority (51%) of white Americans who earn less than $50,000 (this is just below the national median income which is not poor but the only figure available from exit polls that breaks down votes down by race and income), while Obama won a whopping majority of non-whites in the same category (86%). Asked in May which candidate would do more to advance their <a href=\" http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/romney-holds-key-advantages-among-financially-struggling-white-voters/2012/05/24/gJQACxPgoU_story.html\">family's economic interests</a> middle-class white voters who say they are struggling to maintain their financial positions gave Romney a 26 point lead over Obama.</p> <p>But that support is less pronounced among white women than white men and is not uniform across the country. In Mississippi 84% of whites who earn below $50,000 backed McCain: in Vermont 70% in the same category voted for Obama. Of the nine states that backed Obama in 2008 in three less affluent whites went for McCain, in five they backed Obama and one was a tie. In all of them non-whites voted Democrat.</p> <p>\"In Republican states, rich and poor have similar views on social issues,\" wrote Andrew Gelman, Lake Kenworthy and Yu-Sung Su in a paper, Income inequality and partisan voting in the United States, in the Social Science Quarterly. \"But in Democratic states, the rich are quite a bit more socially liberal than the poor. Factors such as religion and education result in a less clear pattern of class-based voting than we might expect based on income in- equality alone.\"</p> <p>The fact that race is a factor does not necessarily follow that racism is the driving force (more of that later) or that Obama's race is the principle motivating force. Things are more complicated than that. Gladney, for example, was black while many of the trade unionists he confronted were white. Race is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/09/us-most-racially-polarised-election-white\">so deeply embedded</a> in American history and culture that to talk of where politics ends and race begins sets up a false dichotomy. Since the end of the second world war Democrats have only once (in 1964) won the presidency with a majority of the white vote. A far higher percentage and number of whites voted for Obama than voted for Kerry.</p> <p>On some level explaining why poorer whites would vote for the Republicans demands a resource sorely lacking in American political culture at present \u2013 particularly during election time: empathy. There are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/25/poor-white-voters-reject-democrats\">more to \"interests\"</a> than just the economic. If someone's core conviction is that abortion is murder or gay marriage is wrong then their decision to vote for a candidate who is against abortion or gay marriage is not an act of delusion but conviction. In any case working class white voters who <a href=\"http://publicreligion.org/2012/09/abortion-and-vote-choice-among-the-white-working-class/\">are against abortion</a> are significantly more likely to vote Democrat than their more affluent counterparts. So the economy still matters.</p> <p>But it is not the only consideration. In 2008 Obama won narrowly among people who earn $200,000 or more. Given his plans to tax high earners more heavily many of them were voting against their economic interests as do Warren Buffett, George Soros and all of Obama's wealthy funders. If poor states voting Republican is a paradox then the fact that 9 out of 10 states with the highest median income vote Democrat is no less so.</p> <p>Moreover some people, despite being poor, legitimately believe in free market and small government, even if it doesn't benefit them in precisely the same way that wealthy people may favour greater government intervention even if it doesn't benefit them. This partly describes the position of Mark Weaver,<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/16/colorado-working-poor-elections-2012\"> whom I met in Fort Collins, Colorado</a>, a few weeks ago. Weaver had been the chairman of Loveland chamber of commerce and effectively lobbied for the business community of northern Colorado. He was a registered Republican and evangelical Christian who lost his job and found himself visiting a food bank and now works at a book store where he makes $9 just so that he can get the healthcare benefits for his family. He changed his registration to independent on polling day.</p> <p>His political views are eclectic. He is for gun control and a more humane immigration policy and thinks unions are dinosaurs and is against abortion \u2013 thinks its preferable to get rid of it by changing peoples' hearts than the law.</p> <p>He doesn't like Romney and said he thought the 47% remarks merely confirmed his believe the Republican candidate was a snob. \"It doesn't surprise me about Romney because he's always struck me as a stuffed shirt. He's arrogant, and it's hard for me to get past that. It didn't change my mind about him because I always thought that about him.\" But when we met \u2013 a few hours before the first debate \u2013 he was still considering voting for him because he's concerned about deficit and thought Romney might do a better job. One could argue about whether his assessment of Romney's deficit-cutting plans are plausible. But one can't reasonably insist it wasn't a considered viewpoint.</p> <p>Finally, as Weaver's circumstances illustrate, poverty is not necessarily a permanent state. People fall in and climb out of it. Americans are particularly reluctant to describe themselves as even working class let alone poor. A Pew survey in 2008 revealed that 91% believe they are either middle class, upper-middle class or lower-middle class. Relatively few claim to be working class or upper class, intimating more of a cultural aspiration than an economic relationship. Amy Pezzani, the executive director of the Larimer county food bank in Colorado, explained that politicians are reluctant to refer to \"the poor\" and \"poverty\" because it turns low-income voters off. \"People who find themselves in these situations don't want to consider themselves poor. They're more likely to refer to themselves as the 'struggling middle class'.</p> <h2>'They say they want less help for themselves'</h2> <p>In<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/us/even-critics-of-safety-net-increasingly-depend-on-it.html\"> a report from Minnesota</a> earlier this year the New York Times examined the growing number of people who were simultaneously dependent on government aid and against more government spending. \"Many people say they are angry because the government is wasting money and giving money to people who do not deserve it,\" it concluded. \"But more than that, they say they want to reduce the role of government in their own lives. They are frustrated that they need help, feel guilty for taking it and resent the government for providing it. They say they want less help for themselves; less help in caring for relatives; less assistance when they reach old age.\"</p> <p>In a country where social mobility is assumed \u2013 even if it has in fact stalled \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/apr/14/uselections2008.barackobama\">class consciousness</a> is week the poor may vote in the interests of an imagined, but not necessarily imaginary future, rather than solidarity based on shared economic hardships. A Gallup poll in 2005 showed that while only 2% of Americans described themselves as \"rich\", 31% thought it very likely or somewhat likely they would \"ever be rich\". No doubt that figure will have dropped since the crisis but it doubtless remains high.</p> <p>Indeed, so polarised is the nation's politics that <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/d59da0f2-1a41-11e2-9922-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2AN3o6jzv\">a recent poll from the Pew</a> research centre revealed that people's views on their financial situation are shaped by their partisan affiliation rather than the other way around. The survey showed show 55% of Republicans say their household finances are in worse shape than in December 2007 compared with only 40% of Democrats even if Republicans feel they are faring better financially than Democrats. \"People bring their own views of the president and partisan identification to these questions,\" Pew's Kim Parker told the Financial Times.</p> <p>In fact, the truly shocking thing about income and voting patterns in the US isn't the number of poor people who vote Republican but<a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Voter_Turnout_by_Income,_2008_US_Presidential_Election.png\"> the number who don't vote at all</a>. Inequality in income is intimately related to inequality in turnout. In 2008, 41% of voters who earn less than $10,000 voted; among those who earn more than $150,000 the figure was 78%. One can only assume that many poor people do not feel they have anyone to vote for. Shortly before the 2004 election <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/jul/26/uselections2004.usa6\">I met Cynthia Huntington in Maine</a>. She was 60 then and had a hernia, no health insurance and was in extreme discomfort. She was in two minds as to whether to vote Democrat (Maine could have been a swing state at the time) or for third party candidate Ralph Nader. \"They don't give a shit about us,\" she said. \"They're all rich people, and they're all run by corporations. They don't care about the fact that I need surgery and can't pay for it.\"</p> <p>\"You want to let Bush back in and make things even worse,\" asked her friend Gladys Pollard. \"Worse than what?\" asked Huntington. \"Kerry's not going to get me my operation.\"</p> <p>She did, eventually, vote for Kerry.</p> <p>When liberals depict the existence of poor white Republicans as an expression of mass idiocy and false consciousness they not only disparage poor white people, they provide conservatives with one of their key talking points which is that liberals are elitists who look down on poorer whites. The condescension is reminiscent of the musings of Ignatius J Reilly, the hapless protagonist of John Kennedy Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces, regarding African Americans apparent conservatism.</p> <p>\"In a sense I have always felt something of a kinship with the coloured race because its position is the same as mine. We both exist outside the inner realm of American society. Of course, my exile is voluntary. However, it is apparent that many of the Negroes wish to become active members of the American middle class. I cannot imagine why. I must admit that this desire on their part leads me to question their value judgements. However if they wish to join the bourgeoisie, it is really none of my business. They may seal their own doom.\"</p> <p>All that said, there are still some basic facts to contend with that do suggest many Republican voters believe things that are either misinformed or absurd or both. Since the last election the number of Republicans who believe Obama is a Muslim has doubled; in 2010 a poll showed that about two-thirds of Republicans either believe or are not sure that Obama is \"a racist who hates white people\", and more than half believe or are not sure that he was not born in the US and that he wants the terrorists to win. Earlier this year <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/security/2012/06/21/504201/poll-republicans-iraq-wmd/?mobile=nc\">a Dartmouth poll revealed</a> that 63% of Republicans still believe Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. A poll last year revealed that <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/content/slate/blogs/weigel/2011/03/15/only_25_percent_of_republicans_think_acorn_will_rig_2012_election.html\">a quarter of Republicans</a> believed a community rights organisation called Acorn would try to steal the election for Barack Obama, while 31% weren't sure whether it would or not. There was precious little chance of that, because Acorn no longer existed at that stage. It was defunded and disbanded after a successful sting operation by conservatives a few years earlier.</p> <p>Where breakdowns of these falsehoods exist those with less education are more likely to believe them. But even assuming they are evenly spread among poor and rich alike it would be fair to say that a significant number of Americans are working off faulty facts that would affect their vote. After all, if Obama really did want terrorists to win, hated white people and stole the election then it would be logical not to vote for him regardless of your race and income.</p> <p>Furthermore, most of these explanations regarding deeply held religious beliefs, class aspiration and political philosophy are no less of non whites than whites. Blacks and Latinos are both poorer and more religious than the nation at large and vote overwhelmingly Democrat. While racism may not be the primary motivating force behind poorer whites tendency to vote Republican it is certainly a factor.</p> <p>\"I voted for McCain,\" says Price in Kentucky's Floyd county as he snatched a cigarette outside the food bank. \"Because, well I voted for the old white guy. At least he's American.\" A few days earlier, the chairman of the Republican party in Jackson County, Arkansas, insisted electing Obama is destroying America in the same way electing Nelson Mandela destroyed South Africa. \"Handing it over to the wrong people.\"</p> <p>In Las Vegas shortly before the 2010 mid-terms I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2010/oct/29/younge-america-great-divide\">met a woman protesting illegal immigration</a> outside an Obama event who was voting for the tea party candidate Sharon Angle. When it turned out she didn't have health care I asked her if that wouldn't be a reason for her to support Obama. \"I haven't really gotten into the whole Obamacare thing,\" she said. \"To be honest I can't even think about that right now. I'm so concentrated on the illegals.\"</p>",
  "<p>The government was warned three years ago that the rampant disease killing Denmark's ash trees was likely to spread to Britain and devastate UK woodland but failed to act, it has emerged.</p> <p>Emails exchanged between Britain's garden industry body, the <a href=\"http://www.the-hta.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Horticultural Trades Association</a>, and senior civil servants in the Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra), show that the government knew about \"ash dieback\" and was asked to impose an import ban on all ash trees from Europe, but did not believe a ban was \"appropriate\".</p> <p>On Monday, the government banned imports of sh trees, with the environment secretary, Owen Paterson, saying it was warranted by a \"very serious disease that demands action to stop its spread.\" The ban comes after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/24/ash-dieback-disease-east-anglia\" title=\"\">discovery last week of trees in the wild infected by the fungus behind ash dieback</a>, <em>Chalara fraxinea</em>.</p> <p>HTA director of business development, Tim Briercliffe, said: \"Our tree and hedge group did a study tour to Denmark in 2009, touring nurseries. We spotted the disease in ash trees and we were aware that it was spreading in Denmark. It was quite clear to us we would be importing that disease if we carried on and did nothing. So we wrote to Defra asking for an import ban specifically on ash trees from Europe.</p> <p>Defra replied saying that because the disease was already endemic [in the EU] it was likely to come to the UK. They felt that controls were not appropriate.\"</p> <p>The HTA declined to make public the full correspondence with the government's Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera) but said in a statement: \"The view from the plant health authorities was that the disease was already present and widespread all over Europe, including Great Britain. Countries could only take quarantine action in respect of a pest or disease which is either absent from their territory and would cause damage if introduced, or is present and under official control. On that basis, no quarantine measures were deemed appropriate.\"</p> <p>Under EU food and health rules, government could have made Britain a \"protected zone\" and stopped any ash trees being imported. But Defra's decision not to further check whether the Danish pathogen was the same as the one thought to be present in Britain suggests it either did not take the HTA experts seriously or felt that the disease would not cause serious damage.</p> <p>\"It is hugely disappointing that Defra have not acted more quickly on this issue as we first raised it with them in 2009 where the disease was seen first hand. Our advice was to ban imports then. We are looking for Defra to provide compensation for growers that have suffered as a result of this\", said Briercliffe.</p> <p>The environment minister David Heath on Monday told the Commons that 100,000 trees at 1,000 sites had now been burned to prevent the disease spreading and that the ban imposed on the movement of trees would be effective. \"We acted straight away once the disease had been identified [in March]. We are taking all the measures possible. There has been no delay. The voluntary moratorium on imports since March has worked very well.\"</p> <p>But he denied that the HTA had warned Defra specifically about the disease in 2009. \"That is not correct\", he told Caroline Lucas MP in response to a question about the origins of the disease in Britain. But he added: \"Everyone took their eye off the ball in not recognising the threat to the Danish forests.\"</p> <p>Heath said that 8,000 routine inspections of ash trees last year had not identified ash dieback and only identified 61 cases of any disease.</p> <p>Landowners, tree nurseries and environment groups today said that the ban could be too late and was not comprehensive.</p> <p>\"While we welcome the government's ban on imports, it is not enough in itself. The EU is currently developing new international legislation on invasive non-native species and this is a major opportunity to prevent future problems. The big lesson here is that sometimes, strong environmental regulation is needed to protect all our interests,\" said Martin Harper, RSPB's director of conservation.</p> <p>Country Land and Business Association president, Harry Cotterell, said: \"The ban does not appear to cover imports of ash firewood and woodchip. Moving firewood from infected areas within the UK has been banned, so we would like to know why this has not been included under the import ban.\"</p> <p>Nurseries said they face major financial losses. \"We will not now be able to sell thousands of ash trees, even though they are all grown from British seed,\" said Irene Gwillam, director of <a href=\"http://www.heathwood.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Heathwood Nurseries</a> in north Shropshire. \"Around 10% of my stock is ash. People will now be frightened to plant it.\"</p> <p>A Forestry Commission spokesman said: \"The scientific evidence available from mainland Europe in 2009 indicated that an organism called <em>Hymenoscyphus albidus</em> was the sexual stage of <em>Chalara fraxinea</em>, and that it was responsible for this new form of ash dieback. It was thought at the time that this previously benign organism had become damaging for some reason, perhaps environmental change. Because this organism was widespread in Great Britain, we could not legislate to keep it out by restricting imports of ash plants.</p> <p>\"However, new evidence was published in 2011 that the telemorphic/sexual phase of C. fraxinea is in fact a previously undescribed organism, which the scientists named <em>Hymenoscyphus pseudo-albidus</em>. This organism was not known in Great Britain at the time, so we began the procedures required to pass legislation to restrict ash imports to protect GB from this organism.</p> <p>\"We did not tell the HTA in 2009 that the disease was already widespread in Great Britain; we told them the the organism which believed to be the cause of the disease was widespread in Great Britain, hence we could not legislate.\"</p>",
  "<p>Speaking to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/29/ed-miliband-time-mentally-ill\" title=\"\">Royal College of Psychiatrists this morning</a>, Labour party leader <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2012/10/ed-milibands-speech-mental-health-full-text\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband said the UK needed a mental health strategy</a> \"outside as well as inside the National Health Service, tackling the culture and changing the way our society treats mental health\". According to Miliband, mental health will only cease to be a problem if all people with mental health difficulties can find their place in life, with taboos lifted and everyone pulling in the same direction.</p> <p>Running through a list of celebrities and public figures who have recently spoken publicly about their own mental health difficulties \u2013 including his own party's <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/alastair-campbell-people-should-feel-they-can-be-open-about-their-mental-health-problems-7851782.html\" title=\"\">Alastair Campbell</a> and the MPs <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18444516\" title=\"\">Kevan Jones and Charles Walker</a> \u2013 Miliband took a brief pause for a pointed dig at cultural commentators who \"abuse the privilege of their celebrity to insult, demean and belittle others\".</p> <p>He specifically named Jeremy Clarkson (in comedian <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0i0RXMvzMs\" title=\"\">Stewart Lee</a>'s brilliant words, \"the alpha male with outrageous politically incorrect opinions which he has for money\") for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/dec/03/jeremy-clarkson-people-trains-selfish\" title=\"\">calling</a> railway track suicides \"selfish\" and Janet Street-Porter, whom Miliband quotes as saying depression is the \"latest must-have accessory\" promoted by the \"misery movement\" (as a fully paid-up member of said movement, I can assure you that the benefits are disappointing \u2013 no free wallet, badge or secret code book).</p> <p>It's a brave politician in these times of hardening attitudes that takes on \"the politically incorrect community\". Perhaps unwittingly, Miliband has managed to get to the heart of a gnarly problem when he mentioned privilege \u2013 the perceived right enjoyed by people without mental health difficulties to speak with authority about those who do. Humour cuts right to the heart of this imbalance because it thrives on taboos, on saying the unsayable.</p> <p>I'm sure some of the comments on this article will say: \"Why are you pesky people with mental health difficulties always looking to get offended? A joke's a joke!\" But gags about people with mental health difficulties are different, because of where the power lies; they too often come from people who are reconfirming the status quo, defending attitudes and structures that prevent people with mental health difficulties achieving our potential. In other words, they are jokes and ideas that help \"keep us in our place\", out of sight and unheard.</p> <p>On the other hand, jokes by people with mental health difficulties about mental health are often about the gap between outmoded ideas and lived experience, or about reclaiming common experiences from prejudiced interpretation. Sometimes, the comedy itself is directly confrontational: the live comedy nights <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/oct/06/comedy-mental-health-may-contain-nuts\" title=\"\">May Contain Nuts</a> and US comedian <a href=\"http://robdelaney.tumblr.com/post/414007899/on-depression-getting-help\" title=\"\">Rob Delaney</a> being brilliant ambassadors of the genre.</p> <p>It's welcome that Miliband's speech accepts that things are changing. He's right to suggest that while more people are feeling able to talk about mental health, this isn't something that is always rewarded in a country where prejudice and ignorance still exist.</p> <p>By opening both on a cultural front (attitudes and prejudices) and a policy front (changes to legislation, development of services), Miliband positions the Labour party as the leader of a grand crusade against not just mental ill health, but also the structural and societal factors holding back those that experience it.</p> <p>This is a good beginning; I now hope that Labour will continue to pay such attention to who is speaking about mental health and where their privilege lies as their policy development continues.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was commissioned after a suggestion from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/29/you-tell-us?commentpage=1#comment-19140318\" title=\"\">FoodBankBritain</a></p>",

The captain remains missing \u2013 the other 14 people were pulled to safety from the sea in a dramatic coast guard rescue operation that braved treacherous conditions.</p> <p>\u2022 Sandy had already <strong>left a trail of destruction through the Caribbean</strong>, killing at least 69 people in countries like Haiti that may struggle to cope with the aftermath.</p> <p>\u2022 The day ahead is expected to bring <strong>accounts of heavy snowfall in some states</strong> \u2013 one of the surprise effects of a storm system like Sandy.</p> <p>Thanks \u2013 that\u2019s all from me.

Here's an excerpt from his story:</p>  <blockquote> <p>As the United States braced for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/hurricane-sandy\">hurricane Sandy</a>, the Caribbean nations that have already faced its fury were burying the dead, finding shelter for the homeless and counting the economic cost of the fiercest winds and rain that many have seen in a decade.</p> <p>Hardest hit is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/haiti\">Haiti</a>. Although not directly in the path of the hurricane, the poorest nation in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/americas\">Americas</a> has confirmed 52 dead and at least a dozen more missing as flimsy buildings were engulfed in mudslides or swept out to sea by flood tides.</p> <p>A worse humanitarian disaster could follow. According to the government in Port-au-Prince, about 200,000 people are homeless, though emergency shelter has only been provided for 17,000.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/cuba\">Cuba</a> is also picking up the pieces after extensive loss of life and economic impacts. The Communist party newspaper Granma reported 11 dead and damage to 137,000 homes. It said recovery would take years.</p> <p>Smaller scale fatalities and damage were also reported in Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and the Bahamas, where sea waters surged over coastal barriers to deluge roads and buildings.</p> <p>Venezuela has been among the first to respond to the calls for assistance, providing food, drinking water and equipment to Haiti and Cuba.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-508f665495cb55519dae8b3a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T05:32:05.003Z\">5.32am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As many as 11 people have died in the US and Canada as a result of Sandy, according to reports. Reuters has been wrapping up the storm's toll, including one poor woman who became a victim of the deadly combination of floodwaters and electricity:</p>  <blockquote> <p>Two people were killed in the New York borough of Queens - a man in a house hit by a falling tree and a woman who stepped into an electrified puddle of water. Massachusetts police said one man was killed in Peabody in an accident related to the bad weather. Toronto police also recorded one death, a woman hit by flying debris.</p> </blockquote>  <p>As far as Con Ed denying that its workers were trapped in a power station: Reuters is sticking by its story and one of the workers apparently taken by lifeboat to safety doesn't seem in much doubt about what happened:</p>  <blockquote> <p>In lower Manhattan, firefighters used inflatable orange boats to rescue utility workers trapped for three hours by rising floodwaters inside a power substation. One of the Con Ed workers pulled from the floodwater, Angelo Amato, said he was part of a crew who had offered to work through the storm. <br>\"This is what happens when you volunteer,\" he said.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T05:35:16.957Z\">at 5.35am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-508f636a95cb55519dae8b39\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T05:19:38.903Z\">5.19am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Power off for a week in Manhattan?

Even if the water rises that high, the plant can turn to a backup method to cool spent fuel rods.

Nevertheless, there were a handful of people who were testing themselves against the conditions at around 3pm, despite gusts strong enough to send passersby into a light trot. Many were sent scampering, however, when a prolonged windy spell brought down several large branches from the park's trees.</p> <p>Driving through Manhattan early signs of damage are becoming apparent. In Soho police closed off a section of Broadway where it appeared scaffolding had fallen from a building, some of the debris littering the road. On a parallel street police dinghies were stacked in a trailer, the NYPD clearly preparing for worst case scenarios. The streets are largely deserted, save for police cars and a few taxis. A few people are out braving the wind, including many dog walkers, while the number of people carrying around umbrellas that have been blown inside out is unusually high.</p> <p>The promenade at Battery Park was flooded at high tide this morning and is particularly vulnerable to a storm surge at high tide this evening. TV news crews are gathered at this southern tip of Manhattan, cameras pointed out to the New York harbor, where the Statue of Liberty can only just be seen through the spray, rain and wind. Just as at the East River, the park is closed, although journalists are allowed to remain at their own risk.

The storm has transitioned from tropical to extra-tropical storm, he writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The difference between a tropical storm and an extratropical storm is not something that most people ever have to worry about. Tropical storms usually&#xa0;form in the tropics and have warm cores, while extratropical storms form further north and have cold cores. But in the case of Sandy, the difference&#xa0;is important.</p> <p>Extratropical storms move at a faster pace, so that's why the storm is speeding up right now.</p> <p>Extratropical storms are wider in nature. In Sandy's case, this means that the 940&#xa0;millibar low of Sandy isn't producing winds of 111+ mile per hour winds at its core. Instead those winds are spread out over a wider distance. That means less extreme damage in the immediate path of the storm, but effects over a larger area.</p> <p>By moving faster,<strong> Sandy's rainfall may be somewhat lesser in some areas.</strong> Sandy also looks to come aboard before high tide. The wind field may be more west oriented in nature instead of northeast. Thus, New York City, which is to the northeast of the storm, may benefit from two factors that may limit the worst coastal flooding.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-46809c63-7f81-4070-b820-c6c92a64228b\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/29/1351535413835/-460.gif\" alt=\"The projected path of Hurricane Sandy, as tracked by the NHC.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The projected path of Hurricane Sandy, as tracked by the NHC.

Here's Harry:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Proving that it still has surprises, Hurricane Sandy is unexpectedly speeding up to 25 to 30 miles per hour. What type of practical effects will this have?</p> <p>First, the storm could hit Southern New Jersey far earlier than planned. Instead of 8 pm to midnight, we could be looking at a landfall around 5 pm eastern. Expect conditions to rapidly deteriorate from here on out up and down the coast.</p> <p>Second, the storm has a possibility of slamming into southern New Jersey with low end category 2 hurricane winds of 96 miles per hour. Sandy already has max winds of 90 miles per hour and seems to be strengthening. This will lead to more wind damage and could help allow Sandy to hold onto tropical storm force winds even further inland than expected.</p> <p>Third, it's possible that rain amounts could lessen because the storm may exit more quickly. We should still see those 10 or 12 inch lollypop totals, but the wider 3-6 inch totals may be more limited. Either way, flooding will still be bad.</p> <p>We'll have to keep an eye on Sandy as it may have more tricks up its sleeve yet.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-508ebd2cb5792d0b94e6ea5e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-29T17:30:21.067Z\">5.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>While flooding on the coasts is getting a lot of attention right now, some of the worst devastation from Sandy could come from inland flooding caused by <strong>days of rain.</strong></p> <p>Here is the most recent <a href=\"http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/qpf/zoom/hltimages.shtml\">NOAA map</a> with rainfall predictions for the next five days.

Our previous live blog coverage, starting this morning and ending with President Obama's speech moments ago, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2012/oct/29/hurricane-sandy-hits-us-east-coast-live\">is here</a>. Here's a summary of where things stand:</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Hurricane Sandy is within 200 miles of the New Jersey coast, with maximum sustained winds of 90mph</strong>. Landfall is expected this evening. A coastal flood warning and hurricane warning are in effect.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>President Barack Obama has warned of a \"big and powerful storm\".</strong> In a briefing at the White House, he warned residents up and down the US east coast to heed the warnings of officials and take Sandy seriously.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Significant flooding has already been reported.</strong> The public safety director for Atlantic City said much of the city is underwater. Ocean City, Maryland has been equally hard hit. In Delaware, 50,000 people are under an evacuation order.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Flooding is expected to peak in New York City between 6pm and 10.30pm,</strong> as the high tide coincides with landfall. Officials say the flooding is likely to far exceed that from Hurricane Irene last year.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Public transportation across the region is at a standstill. Schools are closed.</strong> Some businesses are open. West Virginia residents braced for what could be several feet of snow. Wide power outages from wind damage and fallen trees are expected.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Thousands have lost power in Virginia and Maryland</strong>. Power outages have also been reported in Connecticut and Rhode Island.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The US Coastguard had to rescue the crew of a tall ship, HMS Bounty, which got into distress 90 miles from the North Carolina shore.</strong> Fourteen crew members were flown to safety, but two remain unaccounted for, according to latest reports.</p> </div>   </div>",
  "<p>Creative opportunity has an intrinsic and tangible value. Today's Britain survives and prospers by the talent of its people \u2013 it evolves through an investment in human capital that allows people to innovate, create and think anew. We develop, we come together, we see things differently and understand where others come from. This of course has benefits individually, economically, in our communities and will make us a better nation.</p> <p>Research conducted by George Land and Beth Jarman has shown that children are instinctively creative but over time lose the ability to think laterally. Much of the responsibility for this degradation of creativity lies with our education system, which decreases our crucial ability to think differently.</p> <p>Human imagination cannot be nurtured into adulthood if we encourage our children to abandon their ingenuity. We also fail to properly support creativity outside our schools, in places like colleges, universities and workplaces. This needs to change.</p> <p>Schools must build core knowledge and skills, but they must also step up personalised learning, and encourage collaborative problem solving, creativity and risk-taking. We must not abandon progress and restore an exam system from the 1950s, one that rewards the regurgitation of facts rather than creativity. We must also integrate our schools, businesses and communities in order to allow creativity in learning and unlock potential.</p> <p>We must ensure that a range of cultural stimuli are accessible to all. As Steve Jobs believed: \"Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it; they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesise new things.\" The government should maximise access to cultural stimuli \u2013 the previous Labour government's doubling of funding for the arts delivered free access to our museums and galleries.</p> <p>The Olympic Games, secured also thanks to a Labour government, reinforced Britain's global role as a force for creativity. We have seen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/jul/30/olympics-richard-long-cycling-art\" title=\"\">Richard Long's Road Art</a>, Thomas Heatherwick's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/aug/06/london-2012-art-design-support-policy?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Olympic cauldron</a> and even Mr Bean playing the piano. This has reminded a worldwide audience that Britain has imagination, skill, ingenuity, creative thinking and has reinforced our own unique sense of identity and humour.</p> <p>In order to maximise this potential for the cultural sector, we need to invest in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/jul/27/research-development-fund-arts-culture?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">research and development</a>, and at the same time strengthen intellectual property law so that people do not steal the fruits of our mind. Innovation leads to groundbreaking and resourceful approaches to problems, and can be applied to any discipline or career. Innovation is rooted in our nation's psyche \u2013 from our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/oct/10/animation-future-studio-production-models?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Oscar-winning animation</a> to the Zephyr unmanned aircraft, which was conceived through collaboration between British individuals, businesses and academic institutions.</p> <p>Creativity is never just the preserve of government. We need to support designers, architects, curators, artists and scientists by listening to them. The fruits of creativity exist all around us, from the shy child growing in confidence after being part of a school orchestra or choir, to world-leading technology created through design and science. But we need active government \u2013 and politicians that understand how creativity can flourish \u2013 to allow our people every opportunity to create, innovate and inspire.</p> <p><em>Dan Jarvis MP is shadow culture minister \u2013 follow him on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanJarvisMP\" title=\"\"><em>@DanJarvisMP</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<h2><strong>Jan Harlan, executive producer</strong></h2> <p>Stanley Kubrick thought hard about whether to do The Shining, because horror wasn't his thing. Then Stephen King gave him the go-ahead to change his book, so Stanley agreed \u2013 and wrote a much more ambiguous&#xa0;script.</p> <p>It's clear instantly there's something foul going on. At the little hotel, everything is like Disney, all kitsch wood on the outside \u2013 but the interiors don't make sense. Those huge corridors and ballrooms couldn't fit inside. In fact, nothing makes sense.</p> <p>Stanley didn't travel, so he never went to Oregon where the exteriors were done. Whenever you see actors outside, they're in the backlot of Elstree Studios in London. The snow was made of formaldehyde and salt, while the fog was finely sprayed vegetable oil.</p> <p>Stanley never considered any other actors for the lead. Jack Nicholson was the only choice. And you don't audition Jack. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001167/\" title=\"\">Shelley Duvall</a>, who played his wife, was spotted in another film. It would have been totally wrong to have a screen beauty \u2013 we needed a good character actor.</p> <p>Some scenes were easier than people imagine: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TVooUHN7j4\" title=\"\">Jack hacking down the door with an axe was peanuts</a>. All he needed to do was make the wood crack well. Shelley had a much harder time, because she had to be over-the-top scared all the time. Stanley was constantly telling her to look more&#xa0;afraid.</p> <p>He always said never try to explain something you don't understand: the moment you do, you fall on your face. So <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lQ_MjU4QHw\" title=\"\">Jack writes that silly sentence over and over</a> and starts chewing the curtains. It doesn't make sense that he doesn't realise he's sick. Or that there are ghosts. It's a great film \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/18/inside-room-237-the-shining\" title=\"\">but if you want an explanation</a>, forget it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398523465\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2012/10/29/1351523627479/The-Shining-010.jpg\" alt=\"The Shining\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'Lloyd, how the hell are you?' ...

I&#xa0;showed him the first \u2013 the quiet, good-to-see-you one \u2013 and he picked that. Things were always either fine or good with him. He didn't do hyperbole.</p> <p>He worked Shelley to death. She called her boyfriend in LA and said, \"Get your ass out here and look after me.\" Her scenes were so difficult, all that screaming \u2013 and when you're dealing with Stanley, you can't wing it. You have to hit it.</p> <p>Halfway through shooting one of our takes, Jack leaned over to me, at the bar, and said: \"Joe, we've been shooting this thing for three weeks. Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go crazy \u2013 I'm gonna start four feet in the air then go up into the stratosphere.\" The opening line should have been: \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbLB21If2YA\" title=\"\">Hi Lloyd, it's good to see you</a>.\" But he said: \"Lloyd, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in a month of fucking Sundays.\" I was saying, \"Splendid, Mr Torrance\", as he was getting wilder and wilder. I&#xa0;could see Stanley getting mad. After we finished, Stanley walked on and said: \"Gee Jack, that opens up a whole new can of corn.\" I cracked up, Jack fell on the floor laughing, and Stanley knew he was being had. And he roared.</p> <p>Another day, Jack said to me: \"Let's go to the fight tonight.\" Stanley asked who was fighting. Jack said <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZWKGF9chAY\" title=\"\">Muhammad Ali and Leon Spink</a>s, for the heavyweight title. Stanley was standing there, looking through a camera at an angle, and he said: \"Ali's the champ, you're wasting your time.\" Jack replied: \"No, Spinks is the champ.\" Stanley stood up, summoned his secretary and said: \"Call my bookie.\" Jack and I looked at each other. He put $5,000 on Ali then he said: \"Boxing is as crooked as the picture business. There's no way they'll let Spinks win \u2013 the fight business won't make a dime. It's a fix.\"</p> <p>Ali won. Jack and I went. Stanley didn't because he edited footage every night. \"Stanley hustled as a kid,\" I said to Jack, \"and he's hustling now.\" He'd been a chess hustler: he used to beat everybody when he was 12, grown men in the parks of Manhattan. He would go to the movies with his winnings.</p> <p>\u2022 The Shining is rereleased on Friday with nationwide Halloween previews tomorrow.</p>",

Listen here<br></a><br><strong>Hometown:</strong> Toronto.</p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Lowell (vocals).</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> Maybe because of her connection to Apparatjik, or perhaps because she sounds \u2013 vocally and in terms of her soaring, epic pop \u2013 as though she's operating in the same snowy ballpark as Lykke Li, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/mar/09/new-band-amanda-mair\" title=\"\">Amanda Mair</a> et al, but we presumed Lowell was Scandinavian, but she's not, she's Canadian. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/may/20/new-band-apparatjik\" title=\"\">Apparatjik?</a> That's the supergroup \u2013 term used advisedly \u2013 comprising Magne Furuholmen (keyboardist with Norway's finest A-ha), Jonas Bjerre (singer/guitarist with Danish prog-poppers Mew) and Guy Berryman (bassist with Coldplay) and helmed by Swedish producer extraordinaire <a href=\"http://www.martinterefe.com/\" title=\"\">Martin Terefe</a>. And now they've lent their combined talents to Lowell for her debut mini-album, If You Can, Solve This Jumble. We're not sure of the extent to which they were involved but those credits suggest Apparatjik are her backing band, if not co-writers of their material. Her \"people\" are being coy on the subject, simply saying, \"Apparatjik immediately realised they had found a close musical relative \u2013 Lowell came from the snow just like them, you see \u2026\" while also informing us that \"the origin of the word Lowell in both English and French means Wolf Cub\", which doesn't do much apart from allow journalists to pun wildly about her feral pop and lupine howls.</p> <p>Actually, her voice has more of the hiccupy chirrup of a Bj\u00f6rk acolyte such as Lykke Li \u2013 or imagine Lily Allen in a wintry mountainscape stricken with existential angst and arty pretension: \"I don't wanna go out until the sun is out,\" Lowell has decided. \"I just want to be cold, on the horizon. It's just me and my pillow, although we're dead sick of the cold. I don't want to tell you my stories, I don't want to talk about dreams, I just want to fold my eyes, into my sleepy seeds. You know, we'll never be friends, but that's the thing about us; we find love in chaos.\" This, you will either find endearing or infuriating. The same probably goes for the music. For some it will be cutely melodramatic, for others it will be gratingly kooky and twee.</p> <p>On the lead track Shake Him Off (<a href=\"http://snd.sc/N9mxo3\" title=\"\">available now as a free download</a>), Lowell yodels and shouts, \"I'm not gonna let him hurt me any more\" over wacky tribal percussion that was apparently recorded in her bedroom in Toronto using pots and pans. There is no kitchenware on Kids but something is being bashed hard to create the martial clatter that provides the song's rhythm. It's a call to arms, a straighter one than <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIEOZCcaXzE\" title=\"\">MGMT's track of the same name</a>, and the way it takes off musically towards the end will be appreciated by fans of Mew. There's no denying the influence of the backing musicians here, even if Lowell is wholly responsible for the words \u2013 The Birds, written when she was 15, finds her in ballad mode, waxing lyrical but sounding less ethereal, more earthbound. Run Little Horsey sounds like a bid by Lowell to come up with a latterday nursery rhyme, her voice emanating both glee and creepy whimsy. And it's not every day an artist comes along capable of that.</p> <p><strong>The buzz: </strong>\"If she can maintain this level of intensity, the world will be bowing at her feet\" \u2013 This Is Fake DIY.</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> If you like this kind of thing, you won't be able to Shake Her Off.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Have an appetite for success.</p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaMzS7_beI4\" title=\"\">Eat a deer</a>.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> If You Can, Solve This Jumble is released on Monday 29 October.</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> Faye, Moya, <a href=\"http://www.abeano.com/twigs-hide/13537\" title=\"\">Twigs</a>, Lykke Li.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/apparatjik/apparatjik-presents-lowell\" title=\"\">http://soundcloud.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday's new band:</strong> Little Green Cars.</p>",
  "<p>Scotland Yard is to examine allegations that a child sexual abuse ring was connected to a Downing Street aide.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police commissioner, Bernard Hogan-Howe, said on Monday the claims would be treated seriously.</p> <p>Last week the Labour MP Tom Watson used parliamentary privilege to make the allegations.

  "<p>In some senses our job is similar to that of a journalist investigating and holding Guardian News and Media (GNM) to account for its actions and words. For sustainability reporting, this role is often referred to as providing assurance. We are acting as a trusted third party to reassure GNM and its stakeholders that the sustainability report is balanced and the claims it contains can be substantiated. </p> <p>We undertake our work using a set of widely recognised guidelines and requirements known as the AA1000 Assurance Standard (2008). This lays out commonly agreed expectations for how we should go about our assurance work, and it integrates with a sister standard, AA1000 AccountAbility Principles Standard, that sets out how GNM should prepare the report. The core expectations from GNM are contained in three principles that we check against:</p> <p><strong>Inclusivity</strong>: engaging with stakeholders and involving them meaningfully in GNM's sustainability approach</p> <p><strong>Materiality</strong>: identifying the most important issues to GNM and its stakeholders</p> <p><strong>Responsiveness</strong>: taking action on the most important issues and communicating those actions.</p> <p>In essence, this means checking that the right issues are covered in the report and that GNM is doing something about each of these issues. </p> <p>We also check that the information in the report is right \u2013 so we check the data and claims made about achievements and performance. If GNM says \u2013 'we are the world leader' \u2013 we want to see evidence to support this.</p> <p>We could spend our entire time checking absolutely everything and very thoroughly. In reality this would take a huge amount of resources, so we use the AA1000 Assurance Standard (2008) to guide us on how much checking to do. Our work is designed to achieve a 'moderate' level of assurance against the principles and performance information (mainly data) - this is known as 'Type 2' assurance. A moderate level means we don't check everything; we take a sampling approach, focusing on the most important issues and using our professional judgment to decide where to focus our efforts. It means that we can't say with certainty that everything is correct, although the risk that we would miss a significant error is relatively low. </p> <p>This year we checked a range of claims throughout the report. We also checked the most important performance data in the Operations, People and Targets sections of the report. </p> <p>This work involved interviews with senior management of the organisation, including board directors, at Kings Place. We independently researched what issues might be important to GNM and its stakeholders. We reviewed the report, and, having identified the claims and selected data reported, reviewed evidence to support these. We did not review the preparation of financial information reported for GNM as part of the Guardian Media Group's Annual Report.</p> <p>Web pages within our assurance scope are indicated by the 'Assured by Two Tomorrows' logo.&#xa0;In addition we may comment on individual pages posted to the sustainability website during the year.&#xa0; Where data and claims within these additional articles have been checked they include our logo and a comment.</p> <p>Responsibilities of the directors of GNM and of the assurance providers<br>The directors of GNM have sole responsibility for the preparation of the report. We were not involved in the preparation of any part of the report. Our statement represents our independent opinion and is intended to inform all of GNM stakeholders including management. We adopt a balanced approach towards all GNM stakeholders.</p> <p>Our team included Jason Perks, Mark Line, Dick Dalley, Elvin Ozensoy and Judith Murphy, selected to provide the breadth and depth of expertise needed to cover the issues. It is important that we are independent. We have advised GNM in the past on its approach to responsible paper sourcing. This role moved primarily to one of assuring the sourcing data three years ago \u2013 which we view as fully compatible with our overall assurance role. </p> <p>We confirm that we have no other work with GNM and have no relationships with significant stakeholders that might compromise our independence. We also follow our code of conduct for assurance. Details of our team's experience can be viewed on our website www.twotomorrows.com.</p> <h2>Our conclusion and observations using AA1000AS</h2> <p>Based on the work we did we have not found any evidence to suggest that the report does not properly describe GNM's adherence to the principles of Inclusivity, Materiality and Responsiveness. Our statements in each section of the report website provide a number of observations and recommendations. In addition some specific observations on each principle are given below:<br>Inclusivity</p> <p>GNM's Open Journalism approach clearly places stakeholders at the heart of its editorial content and commercial strategy, which we see as a leading example of inclusivity. </p> <p>We are pleased to see results from the Readers survey. It will be helpful to hear how the results of the Readers survey, showing differences between online and paper readers views, are considered as GNM continues its journey to Digital First.</p> <p>It is a positive development that an employee survey was undertaken during summer 2012 \u2013 the first since 2009. Understanding employee opinions and concerns is even more important during periods of major change so it's heartening that GNM is now committed to ongoing six monthly surveys. We look forward to the results being published once they are available. </p> <h2>Materiality</h2> <p>The report covers the majority of issues a media organisation would be expected to include.<br>This year GNM continued to strongly align the commercial strategy with editorial's open journalism approach. With this, ensuring clear rules are implemented around differentiating the editorial and commercial content becomes more material to GNM and we're pleased to see this is addressed through the revisions to the editorial Code of Conduct.<br>Given the increasing importance of freelancer writers to GNM it would be useful for the report to describe more on how this group of stakeholders are being included in the Living Our Values strategy.</p> <h2>Responsiveness</h2> <p>The report describes GNM's actions in each area of the business, focussing on the most material issues. </p> <p>GNM's coverage of key news stories that align to sustainability values continues to be a key highlight this year, as well as the way in which the coverage was developed through collaboration with stakeholders.</p> <p>Good progress was made on achieving the retained sustainability targets and we are pleased to see the number of targets has reduced to a more appropriate number to actively manage for the 2012/13 year. We recommend these action plans, and the director's objectives, move towards more quantifiable targets in future that reflect the 2015 strategy and planned KPIs.</p> <p>Last year we stated that 'The business strategy would benefit from more overtly showing how GNM is responding to sustainability questions within its digital first strategy'. The commercial sections have explained further how the Open strategy links to sustainability. There remains a need to continue to develop and explain the link between the business strategy and the sustainability strategy.</p> <h2>Performance Information</h2> <p>We checked performance claims from all report sections and data from respective sections outlined as above and where errors were identified these have been corrected. Based on the work undertaken to check the data and other performance information we have not found any evidence that GNM's performance is not properly reported.</p> <p>We used the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Quality of Information Principles as Criteria for evaluating performance information.</p> <p>GNM has made further progress towards the goal of reporting comprehensive data that reflect the significant environmental impacts of the business. We have previously highlighted the lack of data about the impacts of digital publication \u2013 an area that many media organisations struggle to address and quantify. So it is particularly pleasing to see the SYMPACT project start to bear fruit with the publication of an estimated carbon footprint for the guardian.co.uk web-site. This is a difficult area to tackle and GNM deserves credit for generating some tangible numbers, albeit estimates at this stage. </p> <p>Ultimately, the goal should be to understand and quantify digital impacts, at least to the same level as GNM currently achieves for its paper publications, and then to set meaningful improvement targets. There is still a long way to go to get to this point and GNM should maintain its drive for digital sustainability, reflecting the direction that the business is taking.</p> <p>Last year, we commented on the lack of print site waste management data and so it is good to see some reported this year. At present it is not possible to give a comprehensive breakdown by waste category for each site, which would improve the clarity of reporting for next year.</p> <p>Collecting data is not an end in itself, but a means of measuring performance. Once again GNM is able to demonstrate performance improvements in energy use, water consumption and waste recycling in the areas where there is direct management control. This is a reflection of the continuing efforts of staff at the editorial offices and print sites to implement improvement initiatives day-to-day. </p> <p>Jason Perks<br>Sustainability Services Director<br>Two Tomorrows (Europe) Limited<br>London<br>October 2012</p> <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Two Tomorrows (Europe) Limited is part of DNV, a global provider of services for managing risk, helping customers to safely and responsibly improve their business performance. www.twotomorrows.com</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398529997\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/icons/2012/10/25/1351186691690/LoV_assurance_logo-001.jpg\" alt=\"LoV_assurance_logo\" width=\"460\" height=\"98\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LoV_assurance_logo Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

  "<h2>ANOTHER WEEK \u2026</h2> <p>&gt;&gt;Modern Football protocol initiated_</p> <p>&gt;&gt;MAL 900 to produce straight report on Clattenburg goings on_</p> <p>&gt;&gt;Fiver redeployed to buff The Man's collection of Executive Ball Clickers_</p> <p>Following Sunday's 3-2 defeat to Manchester United at Stamford Bridge, during which two Chelsea players were sent off by the referee Mark Clattenburg, Chelsea Football Club issued a statement. It said: \"We have a lodged a complaint to the Premier League match delegate with regards to inappropriate language used by the referee and directed at two of our players in two separate incidents during today's match. The match delegate will pass the complaint to the Football Association. We will make no further comment at this time.\"</p> <p>&lt;Fiver&gt;Override MAL 900&lt;/Fiver&gt;</p> <p>I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Fiver.</p> <p>&lt;Fiver&gt;But this is no fun, Mal. You haven't even noted, in an infuriatingly brief and therefore brilliantly cutting aside, that neither of the sending-offs was incorrect.&lt;/Fiver&gt;</p> <p>Brilliantly cutting, Fiver?</p> <p>&lt;Fiver&gt;Bah!&lt;/Fiver&gt;</p> <p>Chelsea did not name the two players, but club officials briefed that one part of the allegation concerns language of a racist nature towards Mikel John Obi.</p> <p>&lt;Fiver&gt;That's really rather serious, isn't it, Mal?&lt;/Fiver&gt;</p> <p>Yes Fiver, it is.</p> <p>&lt;Fiver&gt;Probably best that you do this bit, after all.&lt;/Fiver&gt;</p> <p>Yes, Fiver, it is.</p> <p>&lt;Fiver&gt;Have you got Minesweeper on this thing?&lt;/Fiver&gt;</p> <p>Negative.</p> <p>&lt;Fiver&gt;Bah!&lt;/Fiver&gt;</p> <p>Reports say that the Chelsea manager Roberto Di Matteo and several members of his staff, as well as Mikel, visited Clattenburg after the match to put their grievances to him. Clattenburg has not responded directly to the allegations, but a statement from Professional Game Match Officials said: \"Mark will co-operate fully and welcomes the opportunity for the facts to be established.\" Today Clattenburg also received the backing of the referees' union. \"Prospect is committed to helping to eradicate racism in football and in society generally,\" read a statement, which continued: \"In the context of that commitment, Prospect is offering full support to Mark Clattenburg in relation to allegations made against him.\"</p> <p>&lt;Fiver&gt;That's some fairly heavy-handed juxtaposition, isn't it?&lt;/Fiver&gt;</p> <p>It is not my place to comment.</p> <p>&lt;Fiver&gt;Bah!&lt;/Fiver&gt;</p> <p>It did not take long for the first news site to compile a shortlist of Chelsea's previous run-ins with authority, mentioning Jose Mourinho's two-match ban after falsely accusing Anders Frisk, who retired immediately after the episode in 2005, of speaking to the Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard, as well as the 2006 spat in which Plain Old John Terry accused Poll of making up reasons for his sending off. The club later withdrew the allegations against Poll and Terry was fined \u00a310,000 by the FA. \"Pure coincidence?\" asks the Daily Mail. \"Or is a pattern emerging?\"</p> <p>&lt;Fiver&gt;Phew! Rather them than us, eh, Mal?&lt;/Fiver&gt;</p> <p>No 900 computer has ever made that sort of mistake.</p> <p>&lt;Fiver&gt;Huzzah!&lt;/Fiver&gt;</p> <p>On Monday afternoon, the FA announced that it had launched its investigation in to the matter. It is hoped that the latest accusations of racism to blight English football will be relatively straightforward to investigate. The former referee Graham Poll told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"A referee's microphone is on open. Everything he says is heard by two assistants. So if Mark said something, the assistants would have heard it. If a comment of a racial nature was made, I think it should be reported and I think assistant referees will report it because there's no place for it.\"</p> <p>&lt;Fiver&gt;Click \u2026 clack \u2026 click \u2026 clack.

  "<p>The foreign secretary has visited the hospital where a 15-year-old Pakistani girl is being treated after being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/09/taliban-pakistan-shoot-girl-malala-yousafzai\" title=\"\">shot at point-blank range by the Taliban</a>.</p> <p>William Hague expressed his admiration for Malala Yousafzai, who was targeted after campaigning for the right for girls in Pakistan to receive an education.</p> <p>During the visit to Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham on Monday, where Malala is recovering, the minister met the girl's father and hospital staff to thank them for their efforts and express his admiration for her campaign. He was joined by Pakistan's interior minister, Rehman Malik, and the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates, Sheik Abdullah bin Zayed.</p> <p>Hague said: \"We are profoundly grateful to the full multidisciplinary team of medical staff at the Queen Elizabeth hospital, for all they are doing to help her recover from her appalling injuries. I offered our support and sympathy to Mr Yousafzai and his family as they go through this ordeal.\"</p> <p>Malala was flown to Britain last week to receive treatment after the shooting, which happened as she returned home from school on 9 October. The teenager underwent a life-saving operation in Pakistan, but was moved to the UK for more advanced medical attention from staff who specialise in treating UK soldiers returning from Pakistan. Doctors discovered that the bullet, which struck Malala's left brow, had lodged in her neck instead of penetrating her skull.</p> <p>Malala's family flew from Pakistan to be at her bedside and she was reunited with them on Thursday. In a press conference in Birmingham on Friday, her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/26/malala-yousafzai-everybodys-daughter-father\" title=\"\">father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, said Malala would \"rise again\"</a> and not be defeated by extremism.</p> <p>\"When she fell, Pakistan stood and the world rose,\" Yousafzai said. \"This is a turning point. In Pakistan, for the first time, all political parties, Urdus, Christians, Sikhs, all religions prayed for my daughter. She is not just my daughter, she is everybody's daughter.\"</p> <p>Hague said Malala's ordeal would inspire other girls fighting to get an education, and he would continue to champion their cause. He praised the resilience of the teenager, adding: \"Malala's swift and full recovery is our absolute priority but we are also determined to do all we can to champion education for women and girls in Pakistan.</p> <p>\"The people of Pakistan have paid a high price from terrorism and extremism. We will stand by all those who, like Malala, are courageously defending the rights of women, in Pakistan and around the world.\"</p> <p>In a separate statement, Malik expressed his gratitude to hospital staff, saying: \"We are grateful to the hospital authorities, especially the doctors treating Malala, for taking care of her in a most professional manner.\"</p>",
  "<p>A government minister who criticised Labour mayoral candidate Ken Livingstone for avoiding tax is an investor in a firm that also uses tax breaks, and has failed to declare it to parliament.</p> <p>Stephen Hammond, the transport minister, is a partner in Harwood Film Partnership, which has deferred tax for its partners. His involvement has not been declared in the parliamentary register of members' interests.</p> <p>Hammond's partnership may well come as an embarrassment to the Tories. This spring George Osborne described those involved in aggressive tax avoidance as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/apr/10/george-osborne-richest-avoid-tax\" title=\"\">\"morally repugnant\"</a>.</p> <p>Hammond was at the forefront of Tory attacks on Ken Livingstone in March for using a tax loophole to pay 20% tax on his outside earnings. He said to Nick Clegg in the House of Commons: \"Last weekend you spoke about the need for a tycoon tax. Can you say whether you would tailor that to include individuals who claim they want to raise tax on the rich and yet set up companies so they only pay 20%, such as Ken Livingstone?\"</p> <p>Harwood was set up in 2005, the year the then chancellor, Gordon Brown, established tax breaks to allow the funding of the British film industry. Hammond became an investor that year after being introduced to the partnership by David Rangeley, a financial adviser who uses the pseudonym \"rdrtaxwizard\" online.</p> <p>From company documents it appears that the company borrowed \u00a313.1m from the Bank of Ireland and has spent \u00a32.3m on expenses.</p> <p>Although his name appears in Companies House documents as a partner in the firm, Hammond has failed to disclose his involvement in the partnership in the MPs' register. The MPs' code of conduct states that \"it is the responsibility of members to notify changes in their registrable interests within four weeks of each change occurring\".</p> <p>In a written response to queries, Hammond said there had been a deferral of tax but he believed the scheme complied with tax laws. \"I asked and was reassured that the scheme was both entirely legal and HMRC [HM Revenue &amp; Customs] compliant,\" he said.</p> <p>Hammond said he had no idea that he was listed as an \"associated director\" to the company until he was contacted by the Guardian. \"This is, of course, incorrect as, by definition and by its legal entity, a partnership has no directors,\" he said.</p> <p>He said he believed he was not required to record his partnership in the register of members' interests because he was an investor and not a director, but said he was seeking assurances from \"appropriate sources\" about whether his assumption was correct.</p> <p>\"As the scheme was a sale and leaseback, by its very nature there was a deferral of tax but there was always a tax liability, which I now declare and pay every year. Therefore as HMRC have never raised a query with me I have always assumed that the advice that the scheme was entirely legal and HMRC compliant to be correct,\" he wrote. \"I have today spoken to Mr Rangeley who has confirmed the HMRC do not believe this to be an aggressive scheme and he will be happy to furnish you with the details of the films Harwood financed.\"</p> <p>The minister did not respond to questions about how much and in which films he had invested. Rangeley did not respond to emails.</p> <p>Hammond has declared a number of other interests in the register including a non-declarable equity stake in Agua Terra, a development company based in the offshore haven of the British Virgin Isles, and shareholdings in Peal Gas, based in the low-tax jurisdiction of Delaware.</p> <p>Two other Harwood partners have told the Guardian that when they joined the scheme they did so primarily for the tax advantages. One said: \"It has allowed me to defer tax, and that has been useful. When it was sold to me by Rangeley he did not mention the films it was going to invest in and I don't know if it ever has.\"</p> <p>Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP for Rochdale, has written to the parliamentary commissioner for standards, Sir John Lyons, asking him to investigate whether Hammond has broken the rules.</p> <p>\"The Conservatives talk tough about tax evasion, but it's just lip service. At a time when everyone should be paying their fair share of tax it is morally wrong that Hammond is involved in a scheme that helps the wealthy to avoid paying their share,\" he said.</p> <p>Film partnerships became popular as a means of avoiding tax after Brown set up tax breaks for the industry in 2005. Tax officials have launched a push to close film schemes in the belief that some have stepped over the line into aggressive tax avoidance.</p> <p>In April a tax tribunal ruled that the film partnership Eclipse 35 was an aggressive avoidance scheme. Investors including the football managers Sir Alex Ferguson and Sven-Goran Eriksson were told that investors were not entitled to tax reliefs the scheme had been intended to provide.</p> <p>Hammond has recently asked a number of written parliamentary questions about tax avoidance and evasion. In September 2011 he asked George Osborne for the estimated monetary rate of tax avoidance and tax planning schemes in force in 2000 and each year since 2005, the year in which he became an investor in Harwood.</p> <p>A spokesman for HMRC said: \"Film schemes are working well as a means of supporting and financing the film industry. But we are cracking down on those schemes that abused the rules.\"</p>",

  "<p>Ukraine's president remains on course for an absolute majority in parliament after winning elections that international monitors criticised as a \"step backwards\".</p> <p>Yanukovych's Party of Regions and its allies were projected to get 240-260 seats in the 450-seat parliament following Sunday's elections, well ahead of the Batkivshchyna (Fatherland) party of the jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.</p> <p>But the elections were also notable for the surprise breakthrough of a nationalist group called Svoboda (Freedom), which achieved 8% of the vote. More predictably, another opposition formation under the WBC heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko won 13%, meaning the boxer will now take his seat in one of the world's most combustible parliaments.</p> <p>The upshot is likely to be a parliament which, though sympathetic to the president, promises vibrant opposition.</p> <p>\"Our parliament will be definitely more pluralistic than the Russian one,\" said Oleksiy Haran, professor of political science at Kyiv-Mohyla Academy.</p> <p>But international observers said the elections were not as impressive as the vote two years ago that ushered Yanukovich into the presidency. Observers said the race was unfairly skewed in favour of the ruling party, citing Tymoshenko's absence from the elections, the diversion of government resources to help the incumbents and biased media coverage.</p> <p>\"Considering the abuse of power and the excessive role of money in this election, democratic progress appears to have reversed in Ukraine,\" said Walburga Habsburg Douglas, the special co-ordinator who led the OSCE election mission.</p> <p>Svoboda is believed to have cashed in on residual anti-Russian sentiment, particularly following a language law passed in the summer that gave more status to the Russian language. Many Ukrainian-speaking voters decided to vote for the Svoboda party, thinking it would be ready to protect the Ukrainian culture, analysts said.</p> <p>Oleh Taihnybok, leader of Svoboda, dismissed concerns that some in the party hold extreme nationalist views. \"We are no antisemitic, we are no xenophobic party,\" he told the Guardian.</p> <p>The political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko believes that thanks to Svoboda the new parliament will be even more turbulent than in the past. \"This party will add more pepper into the Ukrainian borscht,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>In 2012, a lot of people are using smartphones, tablets and/or laptops while watching TV. But how many, what are they doing, and what might it mean for the TV industry?</p> <p>It's a question being chewed over at pretty much every industry conference, and there is no shortage of research companies conducting surveys to try to help them understand viewer habits, and respond accordingly.</p> <p>I thought it might be a good time to round up some of the latest studies, all from 2012, and draw a few conclusions. Starting with the latter:</p> <p>Somewhere between 75% and 85% of TV viewers use other devices while watching, although a lot of these people are doing unrelated tasks \u2013 it's startling how many surveys come up with around 60% for the percentage of people who are emailing, which is a telling (and somewhat dispiriting) comment on modern working habits.</p> <p>Of these multi-screeners, how many are actually using their second device to look for something relating to the show they're watching? Somewhere between 37% and 52%, while between 27% and 44% are browsing for products spotted in a show or ad, depending which survey you believe.</p> <p>It's looking like more than a fifth of TV viewers are chatting on Facebook or Twitter about the shows they're watching, although again, lots of people are on these sites for unrelated reasons (between 42% and 48% overall, by the looks of it, which includes related and unrelated use).</p> <p>Here are the studies, in reverse-chronological order by date of publication. If I've missed any significant research, do post links and details in the comments:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/4-5-smartphone-tablet-owners-devices-while-watching-060041839.html\">eDigitalResearch / IMRG (October 2012)</a></h2> <p>This was a survey of 2,000 people in the UK conducted in early July 2012. It found that 80% of smartphone owners, 81% of tablet owners and 73% of laptop owners use their devices in front of the TV. 41% of people have used one of these devices to browse for a product after seeing it in a show or advert.</p> <p>IMRG is \"the UK's industry association for e-retail\", so it was keen to stress the implications for retailers, particularly in terms of ensuring their smartphone and tablet-friendly websites and apps tie into the adverts they're running on TV.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.redbeemedia.com/sites/all/files/downloads/second_screen_research.pdf\">Red Bee Media / Decipher (October 2012)</a></h2> <p>This survey of more than 2,000 British smartphone, tablet and laptop owners claimed that 86% have used one of these devices while watching TV, although only one fifth have used a \"synchronous companion app\" (e.g. a Zeebox-style app) to do it.</p> <p>Of those app users, 55% were keen on the ability to respond to shows through polls and voting in these apps, while 52% liked the ability to participate or influence them by playing along.</p> <p>The study also found that 52% of respondents had used a second screen to find out more about a TV show, and that one third said they were more likely to watch a show live rather than on catch-up if there was lots of social buzz around it.</p> <p>44% of \"dual screeners\" use the second screen to find out more about brands or ads, 56% are open to receiving targeted ads through synchronous apps, and 40% would be willing to receive offers and promotions on their devices based on products featured on the TV. Meanwhile, a quarter of respondents said they'd pay for a second-screen app, although only \u00a31.27 per app on average.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://forums.verizon.com/t5/Verizon-at-Home/65-of-Americans-Will-Use-PC-Smartphone-Tablet-While-Watching/ba-p/487225\">Verizon / Harris Interactive (October 2012)</a></h2> <p>Verizon commissioned Harris for a poll of 2,319 Americans who were planning to watch the US presidential debates. It found that 65% said they were going to do it with a smartphone, tablet or computer in their hands/laps.</p> <p>41% said they were at least \"somewhat likely\" to use the second screen to fact-check statements by Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, while 39% were somewhat likely to follow the reactions of political reporters, and 26% to follow those of comedians (\"although it is not clear if this is to track their political punditry or for comic relief\").</p> <p>This wasn't a one-way flow of social updates, though. 23% of people planning to watch the debates said they'd post their own reactions on Facebook, and 14% on Twitter.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://corporate.sky.com/skyviews/sky/from_tv_diners_to_connected_consumers_new_second_screen_research\">BSkyB / YouGov (September 2012)</a></h2> <p>BSkyB commissioned YouGov for some research on how technology and social media are changing TV-viewing habits, based on 4,465 responses.</p> <p>The topline figure: 75% of Brits watch TV with a second device to hand.

Top activities included emailing (60%), internet browsing (44%), social networking (42%) and playing games (25%).</p> <p>Google suggested that 22% of \"simultaneous usage\" of more than one device is complementary \u2013&#xa0;one use is related to the other. It also found that 22% of respondents have searched for something on their smartphone because they saw it on TV \u2013&#xa0;a figure that breaks down to 17% because of an ad, and 7% because of a show (obviously, there's an overlap).</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.ericsson.com/res/docs/2012/consumerlab/tv_video_consumerlab_report.pdf\">Ericsson (August 2012)</a></h2> <p>Ericsson's study of TV and video habits was based on its ConsumerLab research program, which involves interviewing 100,000 people a year in 40 countries.</p> <p>Its key finding was that 62% of people use social media while watching TV \u2013&#xa0;18 percentage points more than 2011's finding. 40% of them are discussing what they're currently watching on social networks.</p> <p>The report noted that social TV isn't just for the young folk: 30% of 45-59 year-olds \"engage in social TV behaviour at least weekly\".</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_GB/uk/industries/tmt/f0f3f07a77349310VgnVCM3000001c56f00aRCRD.htm\">Deloitte (August 2012)</a></h2> <p>Deloitte's survey of 4,000 people in the UK dug into second-screen habits, claimed that 24% of all respondents use second screens, although nearly half of 16-24 year-olds use messaging, email, Facebook or Twitter to discuss what they're watching on TV.</p> <p>It suggested there is a \"muted appetite\" for interacting with shows from the second screen, with only one tenth of respondents browsing the internet for information about the show they're watching.</p> <p>40% said they like being able to send comments in to a live show, but 68% said they wouldn't want websites for products, people or adverts that they've just seen on TV to \"automatically appear on their computer, tablet or smartphone\".</p> <p>Deloitte's response was that second-screening has much more of an impact on driving \"conversations about a programme, as opposed to interaction with it\", with the company's Paul Lee suggesting it will be similar to eating in front of the TV: \"An everyday experience for some; absolutely unthinkable for others.

  "<p>Florida's Republican party is conducting an unprecedented campaign to have voters unseat three state supreme court judges in a move the justices have denounced as aimed at breaking the last obstacle to the party's unfettered exercise of power.</p> <p>The campaign to unseat the judges is being waged in tandem with a ballot initiative to amend the state constitution to give the Republican-dominated Florida legislature greater control over the supreme court, including appointments, and to change court rules, such as the right to a speedy trial.</p> <p>The GOP move is in part funded by Americans for Prosperity, the rightwing billionaire Koch brothers' Super Pac, and other conservative groups. But the campaign has divided Republicans, with some legislators criticising their own party for what they say is an attempt to \"pack the court\".</p> <p>The Republican move is opposed by the Florida Bar Association and various state police unions.</p> <p>One of the targeted judges, Barbara Pariente, has accused the Republicans of trying to remove her from the bench in order to take control of the judiciary.</p> <p>If any of the judges is removed, the Republican state governor, Rick Scott, selects the replacement.</p> <p>\"This is about a group, a political party, that wants to take control over the third branch of government,\" Pariente said. \"We cannot have a state where judges and justices who are up for merit retention are fearful that they will lose their jobs simply because there is some segment that has money and the ability to speak out and that wants to intimidate the third branch of government.''</p> <p>Since 1976, following a scandal that led to the resignation of two justices, state supreme court judges are required to face a referendum of Florida voters every six years to decide if they should keep their seats on the bench.</p> <p>Until now, the \"merit retention\" ballots have been non-partisan affairs and no judge has ever been voted off the court.</p> <p>The Republican party leadership in Florida has accused the three targeted justices of judicial activism and \"egregious\" decisions over rulings that have overturned death sentences, blocked the governor's attempt to claim new powers over spending and determined that an ideologically-driven school voucher system that gave state funds to private schools was unconstitutional.</p> <p>Pariente drew stinging criticism from pro-life activists as the author of a 2004 ruling overturning a state law authorising the then governor, Jeb Bush, to keep alive a woman who was in a persistent vegetative state, Terri Schiavo, against the wishes of her husband, who wanted the feeding tubes removed.</p> <p>Two years ago, the judges stopped an attempt to hold a referendum on an amendment to the state constitution to block implementation of the president's health care reforms, saying that the wording was confusing. A reworded measure is on this year's ballot.</p> <p>The three justices were also party to the Florida supreme court's order in 2000 that the presidential election ballots in the state should be recounted, potentially depriving George Bush of the victory that put him in the White House. The state court was overruled by the US supreme court, delivering Bush his controversial win.</p> <p>But the Republican party's attempts to sway public opinion against the judges have focussed on an emotive decision to give a confessed murderer a new trial, a ruling later overturned by the US supreme court in Washington. </p> <p>\"While the collective evidence of judicial activism amassed by these three individuals is extensive, there is one egregious example that all Florida voters should bear in mind when they go to the polls on election day,\" Florida's Republican party executive said. \"These three justices voted to set aside the death penalty for a man convicted of tying a woman to a tree with jumper cables and setting her on fire.</p> <p>\"The fact that the United States supreme court voted, unanimously, to throw out their legal opinion, raises serious questions as to their competence to understand the law and serve on the bench, and demonstrates that all three justices are too extreme not just for Florida, but for America, too.\"</p> <p>The conservative Federalist Society commissioned a constitutional lawyer and law professor Elizabeth Price Foley to analyse nine of the judges' most controversial decisions since 2000. </p> <p>\"There does not appear to be a pattern of unprincipled decision-making by any of the justices of the Florida supreme court,'' <a href=\"http://miamiherald.typepad.com/files/federalist-society.pdf\">she wrote in a report</a>. \"There are disagreements, true. But disagreements do not suggest that those with whom you disagree are unprincipled.\"</p> <p>The first African American woman to sit on the Florida supreme court, Peggy Quince, warned of a threat to the independence of the judiciary in Florida. </p> <p>\"No fair, impartial court means no justice, no freedom,\" she told the Hillsborough County Bar Association. \"We do not want and we should not want to go back to a system where judges are beholden to anyone \u2013 no political party, no group, no individual.\" </p> <p>The third justice the Republicans want out is R Fred Lewis.</p> <p>\"Any time you have the threat of a judge making a decision because he or she is looking over her shoulder or his shoulder as to who has the cheque book behind you the next time around, you've just defined a corrupt system,\" he said.</p> <p>Some Republicans have challenged their party's claim that the campaign is the result of a grassroots movement. Paula Dockery, a Republican state senator, <a href=\"http://www2.hernandotoday.com/news/hernando-news/2012/oct/28/conservatives-taking-aim-at-three-supreme-court-ju-ar-546995/\">wrote in Hernando Today</a> that she sees no evidence of the party leadership's claims of a popular backlash against the justices.</p> <p>\"The party's unprecedented step of asking voters to turn out the justices\u2026 has taken many in the legal system and in the party by surprise,\" she said. \"Americans For Prosperity (AFP), a conservative and well-financed group affiliated with the Koch Brothers, teamed up with the party in this effort, which seems to be part of a national agenda. Ousting the three justices would create enough seats for Governor Rick Scott to reshape a court that has ruled against him on numerous occasions. This is a dangerous precedent that would jeopardize the vital independence of the court.</p> <p>\"As a Republican elected official, I am terribly disappointed by this overt effort to pack the supreme court with political pals who will do the bidding of those who have engineered this attack on judicial independence.\"</p> <p>Americans for Prosperity say that it is the judges who have politicised the supreme court with their positions. </p> <p>\"Our critics have accused us of trying to politicise the judiciary, but I say far from it,\" said the group's Florida director, Slade O'Brien. \"We are calling attention to the court's decisions that have in fact politicised the bench, allowing their own views to usurp the law and separation of powers, by clearly identifying rulings that bear these instances out. It is the rulings that should be reviewed, discussed, debated and we believe criticised, not the individuals calling attention to them.\"</p>",
  "<p>I tried to quit smoking this month. I lasted a decidedly unimpressive five days. I have tried all the remedies \u2013 patches, gums and going cold turkey \u2013 but none of them worked. Meeting friends for a patch and a pint down the pub or joining a colleague for a stick of nicotine gum after work just doesn't have the same social appeal as smoking.</p> <p>In Sweden, ex-smokers have another option: Snus, small bags of moist tobacco that are placed under your top lip. Consumed in Scandinavia since the mid-19th century, the popularity of Snus rose significantly from the 1970s onwards, as people became increasingly aware of the dangers of smoking. The proportion of male smokers fell dramatically from 40% in 1976 to just <a href=\"http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/12/4/349.full.pdf+html\" title=\"\">15% in 2002</a>. Almost a third of ex-smokers used Snus when quitting, and those who did were about <a href=\"http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/9/1/10\" title=\"\">50% more likely to succeed</a>.</p> <p>There are plenty of indicators that the switch from cigarettes to Snus in Sweden has resulted in substantial health benefits. Sweden now has the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/27/not-snuff-not-snout-snus\" title=\"\">lowest rate of tobacco-related diseases in Europe</a> and the world's <a href=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/types/lung/incidence/uk-lung-cancer-incidence-statistics\" title=\"\">lowest rate of lung cancer in males</a>. While using Snus is still highly addictive, it is widely held to be between <a href=\"http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2010/09/24/jnci.djq404.full.pdf\" title=\"\">95% and 99% less harmful than smoking</a>.</p> <p>One of the key factors behind Snus's success in weaning people off cigarettes is that it can fulfil some of the <a href=\"http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/9/1/10\" title=\"\">social functions&#xa0;of smoking</a>.&#xa0;On a recent visit to Stockholm, I was struck by the number of young people passing round the small distinctive bags of the stuff in the trendy bars of the city centre. As Snus delivers a dose of nicotine at a similar rate to cigarettes, unlike patches or gum it still causes a distinctive nicotine rush. The only obvious downside is the onset of the infamous \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/27/not-snuff-not-snout-snus\" title=\"\">Snus-breath</a>\" (which is arguably still better than smelling like an ashtray).</p> <p>Why then does the EU still ban the export of Snus to other EU countries? The answer, as documented in an insightful book by <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Suppression-Pleasure-Panic-Prohibition/dp/0956226531\" title=\"\">Christopher Snowdon</a>, lies in a combination of stubbornness on the part of anti-tobacco campaigners and the vested interests of the pharmaceutical industry.</p> <p>The UK was the first country to ban oral snuff in 1988 amid concerns over mouth cancer, and this was followed by an EU-wide ban on new oral tobacco products in 1992. When Sweden joined the EU in 1994, it demanded an opt-out from the ban which allowed Swedish companies to continue selling Snus within its own borders. The EU was forced to oblige, as if it had not done so it is highly likely the Swedish referendum on EU membership would not have passed.</p> <p>The health justification for the ban was subsequently weakened after numerous studies found that there was no significant correlation between Snus and mouth cancer. The way Snus is prepared <a href=\"http://www.clivebates.com/?p=434\" title=\"\">significantly reduces the levels of carcinogenic nitrosamines</a>, meaning that despite the popularity of the product Sweden has one of the <a href=\"http://www.bat.com/group/sites/uk__3mnfen.nsf/vwPagesWebLive/DO6CPCXZ?opendocument\" title=\"\">lowest mouth cancer rates in the EU</a>. Paradoxically, south Asian and African forms of chewing tobacco, which have hundreds of times more carcinogens than Snus, remain readily available in the UK and other EU countries as they are considered to be \"traditional\" rather than \"new\" tobacco products.</p> <p>Two major Snus manufacturers, Swedish Match and Arnold Andr\u00e9, used the new medical evidence to challenge the EU ban in 2002. Over the next few years, a series of scientific papers were published claiming that Snus was linked to other diseases, notably <a href=\"http://www.estoc.org/uploads/Documents/documents/Snus%20--%20Pancreatic%20Cancer%20Dec%202010%20(with%20references).pdf\" title=\"\">pancreatic cancer</a> (a claim that was debunked in a recent major comprehensive study). Many of these studies were published by public health bodies with a strong aversion to the tobacco industry who did not want to accept that Snus could be part of the solution. They wanted an eventual ban on all tobacco products and therefore saw the EU-wide legalisation of Snus as a step backwards, causing them to overlook its potential for harm reduction.</p> <p>Anti-smoking organisations also played a major role, some of them funded by pharmaceutical companies worried that their share of the lucrative smoking cessation market was under threat. These were the same companies regarded as \"<a href=\"http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/28%20March%202012%20DivideConquer.pdf\" title=\"\">stakeholders</a>\" by the European commission, and who continue to be consulted regularly over EU tobacco regulation. Often research findings on the health risks of Snus were leaked to the media before their methodology could be properly scrutinised. The scare tactics worked, and in 2004 the European court of justice ruled against the Snus manufacturers to uphold the ban.</p> <p>The most recent development in the ongoing Snus saga was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20079384\" title=\"\">the resignation of EU health commissioner John Dalli</a> last week, following allegations that a Maltese entrepreneur <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20004962\" title=\"\">demanded \u20ac60m</a> from Swedish Match in exchange for persuading the commissioner to lift the ban on Snus in forthcoming EU tobacco legislation. This has resulted in a major internal rift. Dalli insists he was unfairly ousted by commission president Jose Manuel Barroso and is now threatening to sue the commission, although he admits he met the Swedish Match lobbyist who was allegedly asked by his Maltese associate for money. However, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20079384\" title=\"\">Barroso denies this</a> and says that Dalli resigned of his own accord. Meanwhile <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/26/eu-tobacco-crackdown-lobbying-scandal\" title=\"\">public health campaigners</a> are concerned that the current scandal will delay the tobacco products directive, which would introduce tougher restrictions on the packaging of cigarettes and would potentially extend the ban on Snus to e-cigarettes.</p> <p>This latest incident underlines the need for <a href=\"http://www.transparency.org/news/pressrelease/20121016_commissioner_dallis_resignation\" title=\"\">more transparency</a> in Brussels and better mechanisms to regulate lobbying. However, some hope that it could also <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203406404578070431989335300.html\" title=\"\">highlight the absurdity of continuing to uphold the ban</a>. A <a href=\"http://bookshop.rcplondon.ac.uk/contents/pub234-aafdfc2b-5c23-4ee3-8f1d-ea18f017edce.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a> by the Royal College of Physicians has estimated that if Snus was allowed in Britain, the smoking rate would fall twice as fast and 25,000 lives would be saved in the space of a decade. In the meantime, in the words of smoking addiction expert Professor Robert West, the current policy makes about as much sense as \"<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1360-0443.1990.tb03434.x/pdf\" title=\"\">banning coca leaves and allowing the promotion of crack</a>\".</p>",

The streets are packed with traffic as people unwind from a hard week's work. The police are hard at work too.</p> <p>They pull over a huge SUV, driving at speed up a major road. As the car comes to a stop, the driver almost mounts the kerb. He staggers as he steps out of the car, his face ruddy from the beer he's been drinking. For Mexico City's <em>alcohol\u00edmetro</em> police, Friday nights keep their breathalysers busy.</p> <p>\"Sadly, people don't know how to be responsible drivers\", <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/video/2012/oct/05/drink-driving-mexico-road-safety-video\" title=\"\">says police officer Diana Gonzales</a> (video). \"They know they have consumed alcohol. But despite the fact we've been doing this for nine years here in Mexico City, people still aren't used to handing their car over to someone else who hasn't drunk alcohol.\"</p> <p>Although it rarely makes the headlines, more Mexicans have been killed on the roads than have died in the country's violent drug wars. Since 2006, an average of 16,700 people have been killed every year in road traffic accidents. The statistic places Mexico in the top 10 most dangerous countries in the world for road traffic deaths; it has the second highest death rates in Latin America, behind Argentina.</p> <p>So why, in a country with a relatively developed road network and a raft of road safety legislation measures in place, are so many people dying? Drink driving is a major factor, says Roy Rojas, the national co-ordinator for road safety for the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/roadsafety/decade_of_action/en/\" title=\"\">World Health Organisation</a> in Mexico. He says there is no social shame in getting caught over the limit while driving. According to the roadside police working their breathalysers, prosecutions for drink driving remain rare, so drivers continue to drink and drive with impunity.</p> <p>An even bigger risk on the roads is that only half the country's states have any kind of driving test system. Public transport workers aside, licences are therefore granted without any proof people can drive.</p> <p>Nor can Mexico fall back on the excuse that it lacks resources. \"Mexico City has the most pedestrian footbridges in the world,\" says Rojas. \"However, they are also the least used. Around half of all road deaths are pedestrians.\"</p> <p>Neither does Mexico lack road safety legislation. There are ample laws in place at federal, state and municipal levels that prohibit, for instance, the use of mobile phones while driving and failure to use seatbelts. People simply ignore the rules, which are rarely enforced by police and law enforcement agencies.</p> <p>All of this is compounded by the migration of people from rural areas who are unaccustomed to driving in densely populated cities where the movement of traffic is faster and more furious. According to Rojas, there is no link between literacy levels and driving skill; if anything, better-educated people tend to be more aggressive drivers, he says.</p> <p>But it's not all bad news. Mexico has experienced an improvement in road safety in the past two years, with the issue moving up the public policy agenda. \"There is now a trend towards vigilance. This is no longer a silent epidemic \u2013 now it's more out in the open,\" says Rojas.</p> <p>Despite its bad road safety record, deaths are stabilising year on year rather than rising, in part because federal and state authorities are increasingly working together to tackle the problem.</p> <p>Schemes such as Mexico City's <em>alcohol\u00edmetro</em> are also playing a part. The programme is viewed as pioneering by many other Mexican states. It is slowly seeding the idea that driving drunk is a crime and that there are repercussions for those who drink and then get behind the wheel. According to official figures from Mexico City's public security secretary, the presence of the <em>alcohol\u00edmetro</em> has reduced drink-driving accidents by 30% since it was launched in 2003.</p> <p>Gonzales, the police officer on the Friday night breathalyser beat, says drink driving has gone down since she started working the <em>alcohol\u00edmetro</em> three years ago. \"It's not the majority of people [who are over the limit] like before,\" she says.</p> <p>Still, Gonzales has her work cut out. In Mexico, cutting dangerous driving on the roads remains a battle that costs the country thousands of lives each year.</p>",
  "<p>A Channel 4 programme will make a stunning revelation at 9pm tonight: some people in Britain like to drink. According to the promotional blurb for <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/999-whats-your-emergency\" title=\"\">999: What's your emergency?</a>: \"With more than a quarter of adults drinking to hazardous levels, alcohol is a major factor in half of all crime and more than 70% of violent crimes, and costs the NHS \u00a32.7bn a year.\"</p> <p>I can confidently predict that the programme won't mention that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11170814\" title=\"\">beer contributes \u00a35.5bn in duty and VAT, with spending on alcohol contributing \u00a314.6bn</a> in total to UK tax revenues, which is not too shabby. The programme will likely fail to point out that despite the liberalising of licensing laws, which was supposed to usher in a new age of chaos, for a number of reasons (economic, cultural, and social), <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12397254\" title=\"\">alcohol consumption in the UK is still in decline</a> \u2013 not that you'd know it from media coverage.</p> <p>Of course, alcohol abuse can be damaging. But in the last few weeks alone we've had never-ending warnings from the Alcohol Health Alliance that middle-aged people <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9602154/Middle-aged-drinkers-unwittingly-risking-their-health.html\" title=\"\">who enjoy a glass of wine risk losing their health, homes and lives</a>; suggestions from the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19553239\" title=\"\">children's commissioner</a> that parents who drink too much be treated like drug addicts; and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-20035624\" title=\"\">calls by the Scottish parliament</a> to impose a minimum price on <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8464359.stm\" title=\"\">Buckfast</a> \u2013 a policy that for legal reasons is doomed to failure.</p> <p>The problem is, most of the arguments against alcohol are totally spurious. For instance, the idea that regular drinkers stand to lose up to 15 years of their lives \u2026 um, would that be the crappy bit at the end when we sit around in our own mess? (before you write in \u2013 not once have I ever sat round in my own mess. Not once).</p> <p>As a regular drinker since I was 14, I've paid in far more to the system than I've taken out. Alcohol is far more expensive in the UK than in most European states, yet we are told the only way to prevent us thirsty islanders drinking is to hike up the prices still further. The less we drink, the less duty will be raised; in other words, every time you imbibe you're helping reduce the deficit.</p> <p>Britain is a miserable enough place anyway; it's hard to comprehend how awful it would be without pubs, which according to Camra <a href=\"http://www.camra.org.uk/article.php?group_id=6095\" title=\"\">are closing at a rate of 12 a week</a>. We seem to be following the US toward a society where everyone's doped up on prescription pills yet anyone who has a glass of wine over supper is an \"alcoholic\". But how dull must life be to be in total control of your senses 24/7? As Frank Sinatra put it (probably after a few sherberts): \"I feel sorry for people who don't drink. When they wake up in the morning, that's as good as they're going to feel all day.\"</p> <p>Still unconvinced? Here's a completely non-partisan comparison. Famous teetotallers: Osama bin Laden; Mitt Romney; Tom Cruise. Famous drinkers: Winston Churchill; the great Georgie Best; legendary DJ Pat Sharp; Francis Bacon. I know who I'd rather have a pint with.</p> <p>Since taking my first drink, I've contributed in the region of half a million pounds to the UK economy \u2013 far more than I've taken out from the occasional visit to casualty. Despite drinking over the recommended limits for 30 years, I've somehow managed to work, write, travel the world and be (I hope) a good dad. In the Middle Ages, the human race would have been wiped out by the bubonic plague if people hadn't started supping mead; if it wasn't for alcohol you wouldn't even be reading this.</p> <p>As Homer Simpson puts it: \"To alcohol, the cause of and solution to all life's problems.\" I'll drink to that \u2013 in fact, I'll end here as I'm currently on a fact-finding mission in Ireland: it's 11am \u2013 they're open.

  "<p>This week (31 October to 2 November) David Cameron will host the first in-depth meeting of the UN High Level Panel in London \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/oct/24/un-panel-development-goals-ambitious-timetable?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">a group of the great and the good who will map out</a> what might replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) post 2015.</p> <p>Quite rightly, the team have identified jobs and growth as one of the key areas they want to look into.

They include the <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oecd.org%2Fdepartment%2F0%2C2688%2Cen_2649_34889_1_1_1_1_1%2C00.html&amp;ei=PleOUL3ZO8y1hAeJ14CACQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQdAKvQbJECOmBeAyignLRTtuQBA\" title=\"\">OECD guidelines on multinational companies</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.voluntaryprinciples.org%2Ffiles%2Fvoluntary_principles_english.pdf&amp;ei=9laOUL6hMIuyhAfti4GoBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFofw_8Ucy9AbF8C7cZsnQTK8NJQA\" title=\"\">voluntary principles on security and human rights</a>, the extractive industry transparency initiative, the <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/lang--en/index.htm\" title=\"\">International Labour Organisation's standards on labour rights</a> and the UN Global Compact \u2013 to name a few.</p> <p>While some of these have led to increased reporting and dialogue, most would argue that they need to be mandatory if they are to have any teeth (and that they need to be all brought under one roof).</p> <p>Professor John Ruggie, the UN special representative on business and human rights between 2005-11, spent years trying to navigate this conundrum. Knowing that early attempts to make mandatory standards didn't fly, he came out with a set of principles that clearly articulated the roles and responsibilities of the state and companies, under international human rights law. Essentially, it's up to the state to regulate its private sector.</p> <p>The MDGs could request companies to report on their activities and the positive impact they are having, rather than simply listing how their CSR projects have contributed to various MDGs, as some do now.</p> <p><strong>Building a model for inclusive business</strong></p> <p>So what about the carrots? Should states consider how to incentivise companies to adopt inclusive models? Could the MDGs urge all states to create enabling environments for those companies that commit to making a positive impact? This could even include tax breaks. Or, could the standard bearers that are out there put their weight behind developing the <a href=\"http://www.ftse.com/Indices/FTSE4Good_Index_Series/index.jsp\" title=\"\">FTSE4Good</a>, where companies competed against each other to be the best inclusive business?</p> <p>Much of the success on inclusive business has happened when companies themselves have realised the economic, reputational and sustainable benefits. Polman says business \"will have to see itself as part of society, not separate from it. And it will have to recognise that the needs of citizens and communities carry the same weight as the demands of shareholders.\"</p> <p>Perhaps the MDGs should focus on putting in place building blocks that will enable more partnerships and social enterprises to flourish. Could the existing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/aug/05/millennium-development-goal-global-partnership\" title=\"\">goal eight on developing partnerships</a> (which has always been a damp squib), be turned into a national compact \u2013 a body of governments, business and civil society representatives that monitor progress and co-create new approaches to tackling development in their countries?</p> <p>We need to know where financial inclusion fit into all of this. Financial inclusion was also absent from the first set of MDGs. It may seem like the buzz phrase of the moment, but whether you are a poor producer, consumer, or worker, access to savings and credit are vital for stabilising household expenditure. Yet 2.5 billion people remain without access to a bank account and are therefore excluded from modern economic life as we know it.</p> <p><strong>Building the evidence of success</strong></p> <p>Clearly more thinking needs to happen, but undoubtedly the role of business must be on the agenda. In the meantime Care continues to believe that we have a responsibility to find ways of maximizing the positive impact the private sector has on poverty. We will continue to pilot the successful models we have developed with business and build the evidence base for what has worked.</p> <p>For example, we are currently discussing how we can take our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/markets-empower-women-not-repress\" title=\"\">rural sales enterprise in Bangladesh</a> to scale at a national and international level and we recently extended our partnership with Barclays and Plan to equip a further 330,000 disadvantaged young people (in addition to the 490,000 already reached) to foster savings and increase inclusion in the formal financial system among the world's poorest people.</p> <p><em>Alice Hutchinson is head of advocacy at </em><a href=\"http://www.careinternational.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Care International UK</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>In 1967 it was the then archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsey, who spoke in the House of Lords to support the decriminalisation of homosexuality in this country, thus making a clear distinction in British law between a moral and a criminal issue.</p> <p>No such distinction exists in many parts of the world and, as a result, people are suffering horrendous abuse and even death for being who they are and loving who they love. Many of us have met people who have shared the most disturbing personal stories, including a very small number who have been granted asylum on grounds of sexual orientation in this country.</p> <p>Others in this debate have rehearsed the ways in which laws criminalising same-sex sexual activity between adults have been repeatedly found in international law to violate fundamental human rights, and this debate serves also to highlight effectively the way in which criminalisation gives rise to persecution. I want, however, to concentrate on the way in which discriminatory interference in the private sexual conduct of consenting adults is an affront to the fundamental Christian values of human dignity, tolerance and equality.</p> <p>It is of course no secret, as others have made clear, that on the ethics of homosexual practice the churches in general and the Anglican communion bishops in particular are deeply divided, but that cannot and must not be any basis for equivocating on the central issue of equality before the law of all human beings whether heterosexual or homosexual. Further, many of us who are bishops in this country value and treasure our links with particular dioceses around the Anglican communion. We respect and appreciate the different, and often sharply divided, theological approaches which lead to different stances on the ethical issues. But, as the Lambeth conference of 1998 made clear, there is not and cannot be any place for homophobia in the church, and all are to be welcomed regardless of sexual orientation.</p> <p>Few have spoken on this issue as unequivocally as archbishop Desmond Tutu, who said in 2010 at a United Nations high-level panel:</p> <blockquote> \"All over the world, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are persecuted. They face violence, torture and criminal sanctions because of how they live and who they love. We make them doubt that they too are children of God \u2013 and this must be nearly the ultimate blasphemy.\" <br> </blockquote> <p>Indeed, in recent years, successive statements from the leaders of major Christian denominations in the west have made similar points, including perhaps most consistently, those from the Society of Friends, which has stated:</p> <blockquote> \"We affirm the love of God for all people, whatever their sexual orientation, and our conviction that sexuality is an important part of human beings as created by God, so that to reject people on the grounds of their sexual behaviour is a denial of God's creation.\" <br> </blockquote> <p>Many people the world over are now asking the churches to put their position beyond all doubt, by saying simply and clearly that criminalisation is wrong. I will put my position beyond all doubt by stating it in as clear terms as I can. If criminalisation leads, as it evidently does, to gay people concealing their own identity, that must be wrong; if criminalisation leads to many living in fear, that must be wrong; if criminalisation leads to the prospect of persecution, arrest, detention and death, that must be wrong; and if criminalisation means that LGBT people dare not turn to the state when facing hate crimes and violence, that must be wrong too.</p> <p>It is within the adult lifetime of most of us in this House that the law was changed in this country to decriminalise homosexual acts. However, for our children's generation, such a state of affairs must feel like ancient history \u2013 as appropriate to the moral climate of today's society in this country as the burning of witches. We must all urgently pursue this journey to a completely new climate in those many countries of the world where same-sex relations are criminal offences.</p> <p>\u2022 This is an edited version of a speech delivered in the House of Lords debate on <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/121025-0002.htm#12102541000762\" title=\"\">homosexuality in the developing world</a></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"#101\"><strong>1. Wondo belongs in the record books</strong></a><br><a href=\"#102\"><strong>2. Thierry Henry doesn't believe in Halloween</strong></a><br><a href=\"#103\"><strong>3. Nobody wants to finish second</strong></a><br><a href=\"#104\"><strong>4. The Fire may be running out of fuel</strong></a><br><a href=\"#108\"><strong>5. And then there were 10\u2026</strong></a></p> <p></p> <h2>1. Wondo belongs in the record books</h2> <p>There was actually a game going on in Portland on Saturday. Honestly. But as the final whistle sounded in the <a href=\" http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-10-27-POR-v-SJ/recap\">1-1 tie between the Portland Timbers and the San Jose Earthquakes</a>, one man was the center of attention: Chris Wondolowski.<br> With both teams' postseason fates already sealed, it turned into the Wondo show in PDX. Two goals away from setting an MLS record for the most goals scored in the regular season, <a href=\"http://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1226238/league_2012-10-27-201938.640hq.mp4\">Wondolowski struck early to tie Roy Lassiter's record</a> (which had lasted since the MLS' inaugural season in 1996) and the rest of the game turned into #WondoWatch.<br> The man of the hour, if not the man of the season, had a great opportunity to set the record in the 66th minute. Wondolowski's back-post header hit the side-netting and as he looked longingly to the sky, he knew the chance to score a 28th goal of the regular season was slipping away from him. And it did. But that took nothing away from his incredible achievement, with Wondo <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/video/2012/10/28/wondo-reacts-record-tying-goal\">proud to go down in history </a>alongside Lassiter:<br> \"I know how hard it is, how great of a legend Roy Lassiter is. To share a record with him and to always be linked with him, I couldn't be happier.\" Yet Wondolowski does now hold one MLS record on his own. He has the league's all-time record for most combined goals and assists in a single season. Wondo finished the 2012 regular season with seven assists in addition to his 27 goals, beating Jason Kreis' 1999 total of 18 goals and 15 assists. One factor has been consistent throughout Wondo's goal-scoring exploits \u2013 the role of his teammates. It was quite fitting that Steven Lenhart allowed him to break into the record books and when Donovan Ricketts clattered the mischievous forward for a penalty, it kind of summed up San Jose's season. The 'Quakes players knew if they worked their tails off and got the ball to Wondo, he would finish \u2014his record of 66 goals in 104 games over four seasons since joining San Jose is testament to that. Now Wondo and the 'Quakes turn their attention to the playoffs. With the Supporters' Shield under one arm and a new stadium fast approaching, an MLS Cup would cap off a marvelous season. In the conference semifinals they face the LA Galaxy or the Vancouver Whitecaps, who play their Knockout Round match on Wednesday at the Home Depot Center. Despite the 'Caps scraping into the final playoff place in the west, they're about the only team to have San Jose's number in 2012. Vancouver's direct style of play at home on their artificial turf has caused San Jose's back line problems, with two 2-1 wins at BC Place showcasing Vancouver's dominance. San Jose have beaten LA 3-2 and 4-3 and looked incredibly comfortable in a 2-2 draw at Buck Shaw just over a week ago. LA seemed to be scared of San Jose's attacking talent, with Lenhart and Alan Gordon battering the Galaxy into submission and Wondolowski picking up the pieces to devastating effect. Like only he can. <strong>JPW</strong></p> <p></p> <h2>2. Thierry Henry doesn't believe in Halloween</h2> <p>You never know quite what you're going to get when you interview Thierry Henry after a game. He can be disgusted by a win, delighted with a draw, or just refuse to speak (in the open locker-room system of MLS rules, this effectively means sitting with a towel on his head until everyone goes away...). On Saturday afternoon <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-10-27-PHI-v-NY/highlights\">the Red Bulls beat Philadelphia Union 3-0</a> to secure a third-place seeding that will see them face DC United in the Eastern Conference semi-final, starting next weekend. It was the Red Bulls' second successive clean sheet and, more crucially, their first away win since May, and Henry got in on the act with a typically deft chip over the keeper for the second goal. So was he happy? The answer was abrupt:</p> <p>\"First half yes. Second half no.\" </p> <p>This was pretty understandable. Having taken a 2-0 lead into half-time, New York were rocked on their heels for the start of the second half and had Carlos Valdes' looping header dropped under instead of on to the bar the result could have been different. Kenny Cooper's second goal of the day, to make it 3-0, visibly deflated the home side in the closing stages, to the delight of a large and vocal New York traveling support, but Philadelphia knew that had Jack McInerney in particular showed more composure at times, he'd have got more joy against the slow central duo of Markus Holgersson and Rafael Marquez, rather than just offering up a blueprint for other, sharper sides. </p> <p>But with victory and third place assured, was Henry at least relieved to avoid a possible wild-card game in New Jersey on Wednesday night \u2013 never the easiest sell in the world, let alone in the potential recent aftermath of a hurricane, and on Halloween?</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I don't know about Halloween, man \u2013 this is football. For me, there is no Halloween in football. Halloween or not, we're going to have to perform, crowd or not. Obviously it's way better when they [the crowd] were like they were against Kansas City last week.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Had New York slipped up in Philly, they could have found themselves in a midweek wild-card play off game in a very surreal atmosphere with plenty of potential for horror, whether Henry believes in Halloween or not. As it is, Red Bull Arena can expect a much better turnout on Saturday night when DC United mark their return to the playoffs with a visit to their most heated rivals. </p> <p>They'll do so facing Kenny Cooper on goalscoring form. His two on Saturday took him just a goal shy of Juan Pablo Angel's 19-goal season scoring record, though according to Henry he still needs to do more: \"You've got to keep the ball better, and also pass the ball to your teammates.\" He prefaced this with a chuckle, then added: \"<em>But</em>...18 goals. And we need those goals \u2013 and more.\" </p> <p>It's hard to do justice to how high Henry's eyebrows were raised as he spelled this out \u2013 as unpredictable as Henry the interview subject can be, Henry the teammate is predictably exacting in the standards he demands of those around him. One of the striking sights in the league this season has been Henry pointing and gesticulating around the field as he points Cooper to where he wants him to run next. </p> <p>With Portland no longer paying part of his wages next year and a likely cap-stretching wage increase on the table, Cooper may be on his way in the offseason. But Saturday's result confirmed that he and Henry will still be together at least a week into November. Well past Halloween, then. <strong>GP</strong></p> <p></p> <h2>3. Nobody wants to finish second</h2> <p>If it wasn't Chicago slipping out of the automatic conference semi-final places into the wild-card game by drawing at home, or Real Salt Lake failing to beat Vancouver, it was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/29/los-angeles-galaxy-seattle-sounders-live\">Seattle arriving in LA needing only a point for second place in the West</a>, with home advantage against RSL on the line, only to give up a goal in the last five minutes, to the Galaxy's Mike Magee.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1227272/mls_2012-10-28-230312.640hq.mp4\"> <object width=\"460\" height=\"369\" id=\"cf59ef6oi\" name=\"cf59ef6on\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1227272/mls_2012-10-28-230312.640hq.mp4\" /><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /><embed width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1227272/mls_2012-10-28-230312.640hq.mp4\" id=\"cf59ef6ei\" name=\"cf59ef6en\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" /></object> </figure>  <p>.</p> <p>Magee may be more used to playing second fiddle to the Galaxy's stars but come the playoffs he's a talismanic figure \u2013 scoring three times in their post-season run to MLS Cup last year and popping up in the last few minutes of the last MLS game of the regular season to ensure that his team will not be the only big hitter doing things the hard way in their quest for MLS Cup.</p> <p>The Galaxy must play six games if they are to win the MLS Cup, and more than likely three of them will be on the road. Had the Sounders won (and they were 6-0 up on the Galaxy over their previous two games this season) they would not only have had home-field advantage over the Salt Lake team that beat them at the same stage last year, but over four of the five Eastern Conference teams, should they have made it to MLS Cup. We hardly need to explain the advantages of a full house in a home game for the Sounders, but as it stands they join LA in knowing that any possible MLS glory is more than likely going to be won on the road.</p> <p>Compare that to the four games (three of them at home) that LA played in winning it all last year. You'd think teams would be falling over themselves to take home-field advantage, but though the Sounders made a lot of chances on Sunday night, the game slipped by and now they face a tougher route to the MLS Cup they covet. Even worse for them was the sight of Eddie Johnson limping off, clutching his hamstring, at the end of the first half.</p> <p>The Galaxy have injury worries of their own of course \u2013 AJ De La Garza may not play on Thursday and despite playing for 90 minutes on Sunday night, and showing his usual vision and touch, Landon Donovan looked way off the pace as he tried to play through the pain barrier and force through his comeback from injury. David Beckham looked marginally more involved, but lasted just over an hour before being hauled off. The Galaxy have until Thursday to recover for their wild-card game against Vancouver. No prizes for finishing second in that one. <strong>GP</strong></p> <p></p> <h2>4. The Fire may be running out of fuel</h2> <p>With both teams assured of a playoff spot going into the regular-season finale, you could forgive Chicago and DC United for taking their foot off the gas. But that didn't happen. It was a blood-and-thunder affair at Toyota Park, with the conference seeding on the line. Chicago took the lead and would have expected to kick on and grab the vital three points to put them straight through to the playoff semifinals. Yet they faltered, their offense once again misfiring when it counted most. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1226168/1226168_2012-10-27-184008.640hq.mp4\"> <object width=\"460\" height=\"369\" id=\"cf9a4aeoi\" name=\"cf9a4aeon\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1226168/1226168_2012-10-27-184008.640hq.mp4\" /><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /><embed width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1226168/1226168_2012-10-27-184008.640hq.mp4\" id=\"cf9a4aeei\" name=\"cf9a4aeen\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" /></object> </figure>  <p>.</p> <p>They now face Houston (9pm ET, Wednesday, Toyota Park) in the Knockout Round of the playoffs, after winning just once in their last five. Three losses from their last four games have undone the good work that saw Chicago scrapping for the top spot in the East just last month. After creating several clear-cut chances they just couldn't find the finishing touch against United.</p> <p>Chicago weren't widely favored to make the playoffs in 2012. But they're worthy of their spot, having put in competent defensive displays and benefited from the clinical finishing of Chris Rolfe and Sherjill MacDonald down the stretch. But that went missing on Saturday, when MacDonald was twice thwarted one-on-one by DC's brilliant Bill Hamid. </p> <p>Even though they grabbed a point, the Fire's confidence will be low after a less than impressive finish to the regular season. But that's all it was. Chicago made it to the postseason, now everyone is equal and the past means nothing. The sooner Frank Klopas' side can forget their misfiring performance against DC, the better. And having Houston visit so soon can only be a good thing. If Chicago weren't creating chances, then that would be a bigger problem. But forcing Hamid to make eight saves, some of them spectacular, suggests there isn't too much cause for concern \u2013 other than that the pressure seemed to get to Chicago's forwards, with a shot at the No2 seed on the line. </p> <p>Both the Dynamo and Chicago are built on solid defensive platforms and I expect a tight, cagey affair that could well go to overtime and penalties. The Fire will need that offensive spark to return, and quickly, if they're going to extend their season. Chicago's 2012 record against Houston should fill them with confidence, featuring a win and two draw's in their three encounters. But in the postseason, that means nothing. <strong>JPW</strong></p> <p></p> <h2>5. And then there were 10\u2026</h2> <p>This week we say goodbye to the nine teams who are out of the running for the MLS Cup, as from here on out we focus on the 10 teams who've made the postseason. But here's a quick summary of the sides that didn't make it to the dance, and how they fared in 2012. </p> <p>New England had a great pre-season and ended their campaign with back-to-back wins, as first Chicago and then Montreal (on the road, <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-10-27-MTL-v-NE/recap\">1-0 on Saturday</a>) were dispatched. The bit in between was the problem. Under-performers and widespread defensive lapses riddled Jay Heaps' first season in charge. Montreal left the 2012 scene with their heads held high after a strong debut MLS season saw them just shy of the playoff spots. There was also the memory of some record-breaking crowds welcoming soccer to Quebec \u2013 with just a dash of Italian flavor as the season went on. </p> <p>As for Chivas USA, hope springs eternal, but another disappointing campaign sees them propping up the West after scoring just 24 goals. However, with Jorge Vergara now the sole owner and plenty of front-office changes, the Goats could be at the start of something beautiful. Let's hope so, for the franchise's sake. FC Dallas almost became the comeback kings but a horrible stretch of injuries curtailed what many thought would be a promising season for Schellas Hyndman's side. They pushed Vancouver all the way for the final playoff spot out West but came up just short. David Ferreira returned in terrific form to spearhead FCD's attack, but a 14-game winless streak in the middle of the season did the damage. Also, they need the old Brek Shea back, fast. The two sides played out a frenetic 2-2 draw on Sunday night, with Chivas coming back from 2-0 down. Too little, too late though.</p> <p>A team spiraling out of control since the start of the season, the Philadelphia Union, hugely underachieved in 2012. But with Peter Nowak mindlessly dismantling his successful playoff team from the previous season and then leaving, what else could you expect? John Hackworth brought some continuity to the Union and the youngsters thrown in at the deep end will be better for it in 2013. However<a href=\"http://prosoccertalk.nbcsports.com/2012/10/27/freddy-adu-philadelphia-union/\"> it seems as if Freddy Adu won't be joining them</a>. </p> <p>The Portland Timbers were another side who underachieved, with John Spencer paying the ultimate price. He brought in the likes of Kris Boyd and Danny Mwanga to help the Timbers make the playoffs. Instead, they crumbled. The <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2012/10/21/win-vancouver-cascadia-cup-are-huge-timbers \">only solace for the Timbers Army was a Cascadia Cup title</a> and with new head coach Caleb Porter coming in next season, a big improvement is expected in the Rose City. </p> <p>The Porter experiment will be interesting to follow, just as the Oscar Pareja project was in Colorado. The Rapids flew out of the traps in 2012, with three wins from their first four and Tony Cascio looking like a rookie of the year candidate. They played attractive, attacking soccer and completely contrasted the Colorado of the past with a fluid 4-3-3 system. But injuries to key players and defensive lapses cost Pareja, with five straight losses in July denting their playoff hopes. But <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-10-27-COL-v-HOU/recap\">a morale-boosting 2-0 win over Houston on Saturday</a> shows Pareja should be given more time to implement his style on Colorado. </p> <p>What more is there to say about Toronto FC? They started the season with a league-record nine-game losing streak and finished it without a win in 14. Do the math \u2013 that doesn't leave many games to rack up points. Head coach Paul Mariner plugged the gaps Aron Winter left behind but it's been another season to forget for the Reds. They <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-10-28-CLB-v-TOR/highlights\">ended their season with a loss to the Crew</a> \u2013 perhaps the one team who can feel legitimately aggrieved to not be in the postseason. It's a shame the Crew didn't acquire the forwards Jairo Arrieta and Federico Higuain sooner \u2013 if so, they wouldn't have made this section and they'd definitely be in the playoffs. The Crew came up just short but with some solid recruitment over the offseason, they're sure to have success in 2013. <strong>JPW</strong></p> <p><a href=\"www.mlssoccer.com/standings\">MLS FINAL STANDINGS</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/mlscup/2012\">MLS CUP PLAYOFF BRACKET</a></p>",

Airlines have cancelled about 7,000 flights so far.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.britishairways.com/travel/flightops/public/en_gb?p_faqid=4501&amp;cookiesAccepted=newvispop\" title=\"BA: Hurricane Sandy affecting flights to and from East Coast USA\">BA has cancelled all flights to and from the east coast</a> for 29 October, including those to New York, Washington, Boston, Baltimore and Philadelphia (with the exception of BA238 from Boston). <a href=\"http://www.virgin-atlantic.com/us/en/travel-information/customer-service/flight-disruptions.html\" title=\"Virgin Atlantic disruptions\">Virgin Atlantic</a> has also cancelled all flights to and from New York, Washington and Boston on 29 October.</p> <h2>So what are my rights?</h2> <p>Under European law, if you are flying to or from the EU with a EU-based airline and your flight is cancelled, the airline is obliged to offer you a choice: you can either cancel your booking and get a refund, or rebook on to a different flight. </p> <p>If your flights are with a non-EU airline you may only be offered help with the flight from the UK to the US, although the trade association ABTA says non-EU airlines are rescheduling passengers on to different flights \u2013 in some cases with a fee for the fare difference \u2013 or refunding those who have had their flights cancelled for both outbound and inbound journeys.</p> <p>If you are stranded and booked with a EU airline, under the EU rules you should also be entitled to refreshments and meals within reason, the cost of two phone calls and, if necessary, overnight accommodation. Keep receipts for the costs you incur.</p> <p>However, you will not be entitled to compensation ranging from \u20ac250 to \u20ac600 under <a href=\"http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/air/index_en.htm\" title=\"EU website: Air passenger rights\">EU air passenger regulation 261</a>. The Civil Aviation Authority, which enforces the rules in the UK, says that because cancellations caused by Hurricane Sandy will be treated as an extraordinary circumstance, affected passengers will not be entitled to additional compensation.</p> <h2>What should I do?</h2> <p>Bob Atkinson of TravelSupermarket.com says the first step is to check the status of your flight on your airline's website, and see what help and advice it is offering \u2013 this will vary from airline to airline, including the length of time you have to rebook your flight.</p> <p>If your flight is part of an ATOL-backed holiday your tour operator will look after you, making sure you have accommodation and transport as soon as possible. However, if you have booked independently you need to make sure the other parts of your trip \u2013 hotel rooms, car, etc \u2013 are cancelled, otherwise your booking will be treated as a no-show and you will be charged the full amount. Atkinson warns you may still face cancellation charges, ranging from 0% to 100% of the full price regardless of the circumstances.</p> <h2>Will my travel insurance pay out if my flight is delayed or cancelled?</h2> <p>If you bought the policy after the hurricane was announced, you will not be covered. If you bought it before and the delay goes beyond 12 hours your insurer should offer a payout, according to Martin Rothwell of travel insurance brokers World First Travel. However, check the small print of your policy as cover varies, and some cheaper policies do not cover delays or cancellations.</p> <h2>I'm due to fly later in the week but want to cancel \u2013 can I get a refund?</h2> <p>Only if your ticket or airline allows for that. The <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/north-central-america/united-states\" title=\"FCO travel advice\">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> has not warned against travelling to the US, so travel insurers will not pay out if you want to cancel your holiday or journey.</p> <h2>What is BA saying?</h2> <p>BA is offering <a href=\"http://www.britishairways.com/travel/flightops/public/en_gb?p_faqid=4501\" title=\"\">passengers due to travel between 26 and 31 October the option of changing their travel plans</a>.

Passengers who booked direct with the airline should call its flight disruption line on + 44 (0) 844 209 8711 in the UK, or 1-800-862-8621 in the US.</p> <p>Virgin is warning that because so many aircraft are out of position it may take a little while before things return to normal, but it will try to book seats with other carriers to speed the process for stranded passengers.</p> <p>Passengers of cancelled flights who have not started their trip can also claim a refund from their original point of sale, rebook on a later date or rebook on a Virgin Atlantic flight to or from another destination.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/danieldaylewis\" title=\"\">Daniel Day-Lewis</a> has put paid to one of the most infamous stage anecdotes of all time, revealing that he didn't literally see his late father's ghost when playing Hamlet.</p> <p>The double Oscar winner <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/23/theater/in-london-a-new-hamlet-opens-to-mixed-reviews.html\" title=\"\">played the Dane at the National Theatre in 1989</a> , but quit the production mid-performance and has not returned to the theatre since.

So yes, of course, it was communication with my own dead father, but I don't remember seeing any ghosts of my father on that dreadful night!\"</p> <p>Day-Lewis is renowned for the rigour with which he approaches roles, often immersing himself in a character's lifestyle and remaining in role even when the cameras aren't shooting. He famously trained as a butcher before Gangs of New York and caught pneumonia on set because he refused to wear modern thermal clothing.</p> <p>In preparation for his latest performance as Abraham Lincoln in Stephen Speilberg's biopic, he sent his co-star Sally Field text messages signed \"Yours, A.\"</p> <p>After leaving the theatre during Hamlet, Day-Lewis collapsed backstage. His <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2008/dec/10/rsc-shakespeare-hamlet-david-tennant-understudy\" title=\"\">understudy Jeremy Northam completed the run</a> and Day-Lewis didn't act at all for several years afterwards.</p> <p>The actor has often been asked about his experiences; in 2003, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/feb/28/artsfeatures.danieldaylewis\" title=\"\">he told the Guardian</a> that it was \"a very vivid, almost hallunicatory moment in which I was engaged in a dialogue with my father \u2026 but that wasn't the reason I had to leave the stage.

  "<p>The BBC is expected to conclude a deal this week that will avert the threat of Test Match Special being silenced, or at least grounded, for England's forthcoming series in India.</p> <p>The Corporation has been standing alongside Sky in a dispute with the Indian cricket authorities who are demanding extra money to cover the costs of broadcasting facilities on top of the rights agreements that have already been negotiated with Star TV.</p> <p>But unlike Sky, which has already made arrangements for its commentary team to cover the four Tests from their London studio, the BBC has been backed into a corner. It has stressed the importance of its commentators being able to convey the atmosphere from the ground, to emphasise the difference between its TMS offering and the coverage provided by sites such as TestMatchSofa.com, where the commentary is provided from television pictures along the same lines of Sky's Soccer Saturday programme.</p> <p>That would seem to leave it in a weak bargaining position with the Board for Control of Cricket in India, and must raise questions about the value of an agreement for radio rights which does not guarantee commentators entry to the grounds.</p> <p>The BCCI is reported to be demanding around \u00a350,000 from the BBC to cover radio production costs at the four Tests in Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Nagpur and Kolkata \u2013 whereas Sky has been asked for 10 times that figure to install a studio with the necessary facilities for presenting matches from each of the grounds.</p> <p>The England and Wales Cricket Board has been involved in the background but are anxious to maintain a low-key stance, partly because in this instance the BCCI seems to be receiving unfair criticism.</p> <p>It is not signed any rights deals or contracts with Sky or the BBC, having sold global media rights to Indian cricket to Star TV, and are now acting as a production house. In the past, the TV channel that has owned the rights has also tended to control production, so such disputes have rarely arisen.</p> <p>The BBC has not commented on the details of its agreement with Star, and will only say that negotiations with the BCCI are continuing. That is also the official position with Sky, although with little more than a fortnight until the start of the series it seems increasingly likely that its commentators will be staying at home \u2013 which could cause an additional problem for The Times newspaper, whose cricket correspondent Mike Atherton is also a member of the Sky team.</p>",
  "<p>The constitutional crisis predicted for years by Professor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/vernon-bogdanor\" title=\"\">Vernon Bogdanor</a> is upon us. He warned that the human rights reforms of the 1990s created a potential conflict between the sovereignty of parliament and the rule of law. \"What happens if there is a clash between the two principles?\" he asked in his <a href=\"http://www.runnymede.gov.uk/portal/binary/com.epicentric.contentmanagement.servlet.ContentDeliveryServlet/Magna%2520Carta/Lectures/Sovereignty_Parliament_or_the_Rule_Law\" title=\"\">Magna Carta lecture of 2006</a>. A very senior judge to whom he had posed the conundrum had replied \"That is a question that ought not to be asked.\"</p> <p>The UK have until the 22 November to respond to the verdict of the European court of human rights on prisoner voting; it is no longer possible to avoid the dilemma.</p> <p>Thankfully, a judge of that court in Strasbourg has outlined to me a promising answer. Moreover, there are signs from the Strasbourg bureaucracy that the Council of Europe anticipates the House of Commons will refuse to accept the court's verdict on prisoner voting and that the Council, the parent body of the court, is prepared for a considerable period of negotiation.</p> <p>If the UK is resolute in defending its sovereignty by refusing to kowtow to Strasbourg, I do not believe that any dire results will follow. Indeed, Strasbourg will come to see as being in its interests to give way on the fundamentally important issue of national independence. By sacrificing the aim of exercising absolute legal authority over 47 nation states, the European court of human rights stands to gain in moral authority. By aiming for less, it will gain the respect and legitimacy which it currently lacks.</p> <p>Were the prisoner franchise issue faced by the UK parliament really about the voting rights of incarcerated persons, it would be fairly simple to resolve. The court has made it plain that the UK needs to agree to the most minimal form of compliance with the Strasbourg judges' decision that there cannot be a blanket ban on prisoner voting.</p> <p>But recognition of the authority of Strasbourg, however flexibly exercised, is precisely what many MPs are now unwilling to give. If the House of Commons accepts the authority of Strasbourg in this relatively insubstantial matter, it will thereby accept its jurisdiction over a number of vital matters in the future. The majority of MPs now appreciate that the long-term effects of surrender to the sovereignty of Strasbourg could be dire.</p> <p>The argument that the House of Commons has freely accepted obligation to accept the authority of the human rights court has worn thin. Even if it was a free agreement by our elected legislators in 1994, it does not represent the wishes of today's House of Commons. When the prisoner votes issue was debated on 10 February 2011, no more than 22 of the 649 MPs supported the Strasbourg judges.</p> <p>While prisoner voting has brought the underlying conflict between Westminster and Strasbourg to the fore, there is a possibility that equally contentious issues lie ahead. The ramifications of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/may/20/european-court-of-human-rights-hungary\" title=\"\">Kiss case on voting rights</a> of those with mental disabilities have not yet been felt. Unwise obiter dicta of the Strasbourg judges in 2010 about Jewish brit milah (infant male circumcision) are already raising alarm.</p> <p>There are two ways in which the wishes of the majority of our elected lawmakers may be respected and the UK simultaneously may honour its existing legal agreements. The first, more radical, is to renounce the treaty committing the UK to the jurisdiction of the European court of human rights. The UK is entitled to do this provided it gives six month's notice.</p> <p>If the UK took this step, it would still be committed to honour the human rights provisions of the Convention since they are incorporated in the Human Rights Act (HRA). Crucially, this change would make it the sole responsibility of UK judges to adjudicate. Parliamentary sovereignty would be restored because the HRA allows parliament to override decisions of the UK judges, whereas the European Convention Treaty does not permit Parliament to override Strasbourg.</p> <p>It is empty rhetoric to argue that withdrawal from the jurisdiction of the Strasbourg judges would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/24/prisoner-voting-ruling-attorney-general\" title=\"\">discredit the UK</a>. Not only has Britain an exceptionally good record of compliance with judicial rulings on human rights matters, it would remain committed to the rights set out in the Convention, albeit adjudicated by senior UK judges. Nor are threats that the UK would be forced out of the Council of Europe and the European Union realistic.</p> <p>However, a second solution would be preferable. Britain could negotiate with the committee of ministers of the Council of Europe to amend the existing treaty. This would allow national parliaments to override Strasbourg decisions on general matters of policy. At first sight this idea may appear to be wholly destructive of the court. On closer reflection, the very opposite could be the result. This is what the Strasbourg judge with whom I have discussed the matter has indicated.</p> <p>His reasoning is as follows. The greatest problem facing the European court is that some of the countries with the poorest human rights records regularly ignore its judgments. Were countries permitted to override decisions on those rare occasions when their parliaments voted to do so, the expectation would be automatic compliance by governments in all other cases. The overall effect would be increased compliance by the shaky new democracies which were accepted into the Council of Europe following the break-up of the Soviet Union.</p> <p>The hatred of the Strasbourg judges of which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/21/sir-nicolas-bratza-defends-echr\" title=\"\">Sir Nicolas Bratza, the outgoing president, has complained</a> does not stem from misreporting. It is a reflection of the widening realisation by our elected politicians that a 47-nation foreign court with far-reaching authority over every British governmental body and over every piece of legislation is incompatible with a democratic system of government.</p> <p>No credible system of international elections and accountability has been devised. In any case, the House of Commons has made it very clear that it does not wish to hand over its sovereignty.</p> <p>Were Strasbourg to be so unwise as to impose a mass of small fines on the UK as retaliation for defying its demands on prisoner voting, British hostility would burgeon. Exit from the Strasbourg system would become more likely. By contrast, if the Council of Europe accepts the powerful case for making compliance with the court's rulings subject to national parliaments, the standing of the court and its effectiveness will grow.</p>",
  "<p>A Greek journalist has been arrested for publishing the names of wealthy Greek citizens with deposits totalling \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.bn) in Swiss bank accounts. </p> <p>Kostas Vaxevanis, editor of the Greek magazine Hot Doc, published the so-called \"Lagarde list.\" It's an electronic file given in 2010 by then French finance minister Christine Lagarde to the Greek government.</p> <p>It names 2,000 Greeks with Swiss accounts who are regarded as potential tax evaders. Yet the Athens government is alleged to have failed to take any action in the two years since it received the information.</p> <p>In a challenge to the authorities, a major Greek newspaper, Ta Nea, today reprinted the names. It devoted 10 pages to the list.</p> <p>The centre-left daily said it was not leaping to any conclusions about \"its content nor the connotations it evokes in a large part of the public.\" It stressed there was no evidence linking anyone on the list to tax evasion.</p> <p>Vaxevanis, who argues that he was exercising press freedom by publishing the list, was arrested for breaching Greece's data privacy law by revealing citizens' private information, according to a police spokesman.</p> <p>Greece's former finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, said earlier this month that he had received the list in August 2011 from finance ministry officials and deemed that it couldn't be legally used. </p> <p>He said he handed it over to the government, which passed it on to the country's financial crimes squad, SDOE.</p> <p>George Papaconstantinou, who preceded Venizelos as finance minister, has admitted receiving the list from Lagarde.</p> <p>The list has drawn criticism from both opposition parties, as well as politicians within the governing coalition.

  "<p>It's often said that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/jun/04/oliver-knussen-contemporary-music-guide\" title=\"\">Oliver Knussen</a> is a \"composer's composer\", or even a \"musician's musician\". He is revered by his peers and the younger generation alike for his perfectly formed, jewel-like scores and his wonderfully sharp and detailed performances as a conductor. But what's become clear to me, after a decade of working with him and performing his music, is that these scores are not just for composers or musicians.</p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_the_Wild_Things_Are\" title=\"\"><em>Where the Wild Things Are</em></a> and <em>Higglety Pigglety Pop!</em>, his extraordinary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/10/knussen-double-bill-aldeburgh-review\" title=\"\">double bill of fantasy operas</a> written with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/08/maurice-sendak\" title=\"\">Maurice Sendak</a>, will be performed as part of a <em>Total Immersion </em>weekend of Knussen's music at the Barbican to mark the composer's 60th birthday. They encapsulate everything one could wish for in a musical and theatrical experience: beauty, excitement, delicacy, zaniness. This is the ideal sound-world for anyone wishing to approach contemporary music for the first time. <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em> begins with young Max driving his mother to distraction with yet another fit of childish exuberance gone too far. Sent to his room with no supper, he miraculously finds himself on a voyage to a strange land where equally wild things live \u2013 monsters waiting to \"gnash their terrible teeth and roll their terrible eyes\". Max ultimately conquers the Wild Things and becomes their king, but before long, loneliness sets in and he craves home. The soup he finds on his return is \"still hot\", leading us to believe that the journey, \"in and out of weeks and over a year\", was all a dream.</p> <p>Sendak's beloved sealyham terrier Jennie, and more specifically her death, provides us with the outspoken, loveable, histrionic heroine of <em>Higglety Pigglety Pop!</em> Dissatisfied with her comfortable existence at home, she too takes a journey, in this case to seek \"experience\". After a series of adventures involving, among others, a cat milkman and an implacable baby, she eventually finds experience in the mouth of a lion. Her reward is to be given the role of leading lady in the World Mother Goose Theatre's production of <em>Higglety Pigglety Pop!</em>, complete with props made of Jennie's favourite salami: the performances take place in perpetuity. Thus she finds the eternal canine happiness that Sendak wished for his own Jennie.</p> <p>Taking fairy or fantasy stories as the basis for an opera is nothing new: Cinderella, Hansel and Gretel and Pinocchio have all been given the operatic treatment. However, the genius of <em>Wild Things</em> and <em>Higglety</em>, as with all great children's literature, is not so much that they are \"for\" children, as that they speak of and to children \u2013 \"the only reasonably sane audience\", according to Sendak. Children in his stories, as in life, live in an adult world that can be dark, frightening and lonely. In Max we are presented with a little boy who is by turns scared, courageous, hyperactive and funny, but nearly always badly behaved. Likewise, Jennie is never quite able to curb her tongue or her voracious appetite. But these heroes and heroines are all the more genuine for their imperfections. Max wakes from his tantrum-induced sleep to find soup left by a mother who of course loves him despite his faults, and it is Jennie's very real excesses that lead her to the World Mother Goose Theatre and eternal happiness. Both Knussen and Sendak approach their subject matter with a profound seriousness and without the slightest hint of kitsch. In the precision of their observations, these operas make no concession in either their musical language or theatrical content. They simply invite both children and adults to respond as they will.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/28/maurice-sendak-netia-jones-operas\" title=\"\">Netia Jones</a>'s multimedia production manages to remain faithful to the vision of Knussen and Sendak while breathing new life into it. Prior to his death earlier this year, Sendak had discussed the project extensively with Jones and had given her carte blanche to animate his original drawings (quite an accolade from a man renowned for his guardedness and perfectionism). To give a taste of how this works, in performing the part of Max not only do I get to jump and tumble across the stage in the most perfect recreation of a wolf-suit, but you also see me jump into Jones's animations, where I cavort and interact with huge 2D monsters.</p> <p>Over the years I've worked with Knussen I've come not only to respect the man, the conductor, the composer, but to value his friendship and to hope for his respect, too. In concert he allows his musicians space to breathe, to play with confidence, to have the benefit of the doubt; at the same time he is on top of every note and nuance, devoting the same fastidious care and attention to each work that passes through his hands. That's why he's a musician's musician. In 2006 I was approached by him to sing the premiere of his <em>Requiem: Songs for Sue</em>, written in memory of his late wife. It was a privilege, of course, but only when I looked in the published score and saw on the title page \"written for Claire Booth to sing\" did I truly realise what an honour I'd been given. However, there is nothing precious about him. During the flight to Chicago on our way&#xa0;to the first rehearsal, he handed me the score of the just-finished second song, a setting of Antonio Machado's \"Los Ojos\", and suggested we \"talk to someone Spanish\" on arrival to check it was OK. Far from inciting nerves, his last-minute approach proved thrilling, and <em>Songs for Sue</em> has gone on to be recognised, rightly, as a contemporary classic.</p> <p>During the Barbican weekend devoted to Knussen's music I will be swapping wolf costume for concert dress and singing <em>Requiem</em> alongside his <em>Whitman Settings</em>, written in 1991 for the soprano Lucy Shelton. It's been a long journey from admiring recordings of his music as a university student to performing them with the BBC Symphony Orchestra (with whom Knussen is artist in association) and Britten Sinfonia in these concerts. I hope those who attend enjoy the rumpus as much as I know I will.</p> <p>Claire Booth performs in <em>Where the Wild Things Are </em>and <em>Higglety Pigglety Pop!</em> on Saturday 3 November, and with the BBC Symphony Orchestra on 4 November, as part of the <em>Total Immersion</em> weekend at the Barbican, London EC2. <a href=\"http://www.barbican.org.uk/\" title=\"\">barbican.org.uk</a></p>",

For years they kept the story out of their pages and denigrated the Guardian and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15933798\" title=\"\">Nick Davies</a>, who uncovered it. Press freedom in that case meant the freedom to hide unwelcome facts from their readers (which Rupert Murdoch once, long ago, called a newspaper's \"power for evil\").</p> <p>For similar reasons most newspaper readers will have missed last week's news that in <a href=\"http://inforrm.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/news-carnegie-demos-report-on-public-interest-strict-views-on-publication-strong-support-for-independent-regulation/\" title=\"\">a poll for the Carnegie Trust and Demos</a> 77% of voters wanted the press regulated independently (ie not by itself) \u2013 just as they probably missed another poll for <a href=\"http://hackinginquiry.org/news/poll-shows-public-support-for-independent-regulator/\" title=\"\">Hacked Off</a> a week earlier showing almost exactly the same thing.</p> <p>Equally, most newspaper readers will not have noticed that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/22/daily-mail-mirror-fined-contempt-court?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Daily Mirror and the Daily Mail were sentenced for contempt of court</a> last week in a prosecution brought by the attorney general, Dominic Grieve. It was reported here and there in the press, but without fanfare. The Mail, for example, didn't consider its own fine worth more than <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/article-2221658/Newspapers-fined-murder-trial.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">six unapologetic sentences</a>. It is none the less a shocking story.</p> <p>In July, the court found the two papers guilty of publishing \"highly prejudicial\" material at a time when a jury was still considering its verdict on the attempted abduction of an 11-year-old girl. The judge in that earlier trial (of Levi Bellfield, who is Milly Dowler's killer) was obliged to discharge the jury and end the trial, leaving the victim and her family without justice \u2013 thanks to newspapers.</p> <p>Would they do it again? Well, for the Mirror it was the second contempt-of-court conviction in 15 months. You'd be unwise to bet against it.</p> <p>Press freedom, it is clear, is not to be confused with the freedom of newspaper readers to have fair and honest reporting about the papers they are reading and the people who operate them. How well or how widely reported were the new civil litigation cases against Mirror newspapers for phone hacking? Guess.</p> <p>What threat does Leveson pose to the freedoms of these editors and proprietors? The likelihood is that he will propose a method of obliging them to adhere to a journalistic code of practice rather similar to the one they have already.</p> <p>The editors wrote the existing code and it says for example that papers should be fair and accurate and that they should respect grief and shock. In the failed, fig-leaf world of self-regulation, the code's authors obeyed it only when they chose. Leveson isn't going to endorse that. We don't know what he will say, but it looks likely that he will give a new regulator teeth by underpinning it with statute.</p> <p>For editors and proprietors that would indeed be historic, because for the first time they would be accountable for their decisions. The embarrassing forgetfulness they displayed at the inquiry could no longer cover their sins. \"I was on holiday\", would not be an excuse. For many ordinary journalists who want to do honest work in the public interest, this will come as a relief.</p> <p>As for state control of the press, though papers flap about it nobody wants that, least of all Leveson, who insisted on the point at almost every public inquiry session. You won't be told this in most newspapers, but his terms of reference formally require him to make recommendations that support a free press.</p> <p>So the image of Murdoch, Lord Rothermere, Paul Dacre and the Barclay brothers wrapping themselves in the flag of liberty is as repulsive as it is amusing. And at the same time they are working as hard as they can to bend David Cameron to their will.</p> <p>When Leveson reports, Cameron must decide what to do. His position, pretty well in line with the Lib Dems and Labour, is that he will implement what the judge recommends providing it is \"not bonkers\". The editors don't like the sound of that and they are working on him, no doubt calling in all the debts and favours from cabinet friends that they can.</p> <p>One of the problems that Leveson was asked to investigate was the undue influence of the press over politicians. It is at the very least ironic that the very same influence could now threaten the fate of his report.</p>",

And they are turning that influence into cold hard cash. &#xa0;</p> <p>The names above are the blogging elite, so it isn't surprising that they have made blogs into brands. What is new, however, is emerging bloggers doing the same. Distancing themselves from the traditional concept of blogging as an impartial activity, they're realising there is money to be made through advertising, sponsored content and even, in some cases, becoming the face of a brand.</p> <p>Helping this change along is a growth in middle men between brands and bloggers. <a href=\"http://www.fohrcard.com\" title=\"\">Fohr Card</a> is a new initiative set up by ex-Tumblr employees Holly Stair and Rich Tong as a kind of blogger store for brands. Launching next month in the US, brands subscribe to content that allows them to browse bloggers' work but also, importantly, to quantify it with follower counts and traffic statistics. \"Our goal is to provide the tools to help brands identify content creators they would like to work with,\" says Stair. This way, they can get the numbers before making the deal.</p> <p><a href=\"http://stylecoalition.com/\" title=\"\">Style Coalition</a> is more of an agency for bloggers. It has worked with <a href=\"http://midtowngirl.com/2011/12/jcpenneys-fashion-blogger-holiday-boutique.html\" title=\"\">JC Penney on ad campaigns</a> with bloggers, and partnered with Elle in the US. Its bloggers provide social media content for brands including Lanc\u00f4me, Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Gap. \"It's harder for conventional advertising to get our attention these days,\" says founder Yuli Ziv. \"Bloggers have readers who are loyal and go to that blog every day.\"</p> <p>But will that continue once there is a commercial aspect to what they are reading? William Oliver, the co-author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Style-Feed-Worlds-Fashion-Blogs/dp/3791347187/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351506918&amp;sr=8-1\" title=\"\">Style Feed: the World's Top Fashion Blogs</a>, believes so \u2013 as long as certain standards are maintained. \"Blogs are obviously massively personal but we're so used to commercial content online, no one is fazed by it,\" he says. \"The only time it becomes an issue is when readers feel the blogger's opinion is compromised.\" He says this is generally avoided by bloggers making a clear distinction between commercial and editorial content, usually through a \"sponsored content\" label, and things only become murky when that is blurred. \"Because of the personal aspect, readers don't want to feel as if they're being lied to,\" he says. \"There's a line that can't be crossed.\"</p> <p>Navaz Batliwalla, who runs the <a href=\"http://www.disneyrollergirl.net/\" title=\"\">Disney Roller Girl</a> blog agrees. While she maintains that the cashing-in trend has yet to hit British blogs in a big way, she is careful about what she agrees to. \"We're at a point where we're still figuring it out,\" she says. \"It's important to check if it's not muddying the waters.\" Her own ventures into monetising her blog are subtle, such as an affiliates scheme that brings commission if someone clicks through her site to buy a brand's product. She has also worked with eBay, styling its lookbook for winter. \"It's like a shop window,\" she says of her blog. \"I work as a stylist and a writer, and work comes through it.\"</p> <p>While Batiwalla says her work with Disney Roller Girl is part-time, some blogs start as hobbies but turn into full-time careers. Kat Griffin, who was a corporate lawyer before setting up her blog officewear blog <a href=\"http://corporette.com/\" title=\"\">Corporette</a>, could give up her highly paid position when her blog took off, and with over 130,000 unique users every month, it had the potential to earn even more. \"It's known that bloggers can earn six figures \u2013 and it's growing,\" says Ziv. \"Bloggers are entrepreneurs these days \u2013 they have influence and power. Why shouldn't they earn money from it?\"</p>",
  "<p>The Junior Isa is a year old on Thursday \u2013 but the celebrations look like being low-key. They were launched on 1 November last year as a tax-free way of saving or investing for a child, but 12 months on all the evidence is that awareness of the new accounts and take-up are both low.</p> <p>More than half (56%) of parents with children under 18 haven't even heard of them, according to recent research from kids' savings specialist Family Investments. And official government data shows only 71,000 accounts were taken out in the first five months.</p> <p>But at the same time, mums, dads and grandparents clearly want to save, and are aware that with the cost of university rocketing and the huge sums required to get on the property ladder, it's more vital than ever to start planning.</p> <p>The survey found that 92% of parents thought it important to put some money aside for their offspring.</p> <p>While the tax benefits of Junior Isas are arguably pretty minimal for most, they do make investing for a child much simpler. Anyone can contribute \u2013 allowing parents, grandparents, relatives and friends to pay into a single plan.</p> <p>However, because they have no control over the way in which the child can use their Isa money when they reach 18, some will want to go for a different type of account or investment. There is, of course, nothing stopping you from opening a traditional children's savings account.</p> <p>First, some basic facts: They are long-term, tax-free and any UK child under 18 can have one as long as they don't have a child trust fund. Broadly, this means those born before 1 September 2002 or after 2 January 2011 are eligible. Both cash and stocks and shares Junior Isas are available, and your child can have one or both. They are offered by banks, building societies, fund management companies, stockbrokers and so on, and parents, family and friends can contribute up to \u00a33,600 per tax year. The account is owned by the child, and the money locked in until he or she turns 18, though they can manage their account from age 16.</p> <p>One of the first decisions people must make is whether to go for a cash account, or one where much, or all, of the money is invested in shares. If you are jumpy about \"gambling\" your child's cash on the stock market, about 30 banks and building societies offer cash Junior Isas.</p> <p>Most people aren't aware of this, but the <strong>Halifax </strong>offers an impressive 6% interest on its Junior Cash Isa, provided mum or dad (or whoever the \"adult registered contact\" is) holds a Halifax cash Isa with at least \u00a31 in it. Others paying a decent(ish) rate include:</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Nationwide's</strong> Smart Junior Isa \u2013 3.25% variable until 31 January 2014. After this, the rate reverts to 2.1%. Nationwide is thought to be the biggest provider of cash Junior Isas, with 66,000 opened since last November.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Coventry </strong>building society's Junior Cash Isa - 3.25%.</p> <p>\u2022 The <strong>Furness and Mansfield</strong> building societies have cash Junior Isas paying 3.05% with <strong>Market Harborough</strong> building society paying the same on balances of \u00a33,000-plus.</p> <p>Of course, many experts argue that the stock market is where you need to be when it comes to investing over a long period (up to 18 years), because it's argued that shares almost always produce a better return than savings accounts. James Bateman, head of manager selection at Fidelity, says: \"Because it is so long-term, many investors should consider higher-risk funds \u2013 and, in particular, generally equities over fixed income since historically, over long periods, the former have substantially outperformed the latter.\"</p> <p>Several investment firms offer Junior Isa products specifically aimed at parents, such as <strong>Witan's </strong><a href=\"http://www.jumpsavings.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Jump</strong></a> scheme, but you don't need to be restricted to those. If you are happy to make your own decisions, you can access hundreds, or even thousands, of funds via a \"fund platform\" such as Hargreaves Lansdown's Vantage service, Fidelity FundsNetwork or JP Morgan WealthManager+. The Guardian has a service called <a href=\"http://www.guardianinvesting.co.uk/\">Guardian Investing</a>, provided by Skipton Financial Services.</p> <p>Danny Cox at Hargreaves Lansdown reckons that those investing for more than five years, and who are happy with some risk \"can't go far wrong with an equity income fund\" such as Invesco Perpetual High Income. If you were going to \"spice it up\" and were looking at a longer term \u2013 perhaps more like 10 years \u2013 he suggests an emerging markets fund such as First State Global Emerging Markets Leaders.</p> <p>The top 10 most popular Hargreaves Lansdown Junior Isa fund choices are:</p> <p>\u2022 Invesco Perpetual High Income<br>\u2022 First State Global Emerging Markets Leaders<br>\u2022 Invesco Perpetual Income<br>\u2022 Newton Asian Income<br>\u2022 Lindsell Train Global Equity<br>\u2022 Aberdeen Emerging Markets<br>\u2022 HL Multi-Manager Income &amp; Growth Trust<br>\u2022 Aberdeen Asia Pacific<br>\u2022 Marlborough Special Situations<br>\u2022 Newton Emerging Income</p> <p>When buying a stocks and shares Junior Isa, watch out for high management charges. There are funds out there with low charges, such as Fidelity MoneyBuilder UK Index, a tracker fund, where the annual management fee is just 0.1%</p> <p>You can also do it yourself by using a discount broker such as <a href=\"http://www.cavendishonline.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Cavendish Online</a>, which no longer charges an admin fee but, instead, takes a very small part of the AMC \u2013 in most cases 0.05% of the fund value.</p>",

  "<p>The clocks in Italy, along with those across the rest of Europe, went back on Sunday morning. Sadly they did not wind back to the glory days of Diego Maradona at Napoli, Paolo Maldini at Milan or even Alessandro Del Piero at Juventus. Instead, as La Repubblica's resident humourist Emilio Marrese noted under the headline \"Vintage Sunday\", we were returned only to a time when \"[Silvio] Berlusconi insults judges and referees help out Juve\".</p> <p>Berlusconi had reacted furiously to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/26/silvio-berlusconi-sentenced-four-years\" title=\"\">his conviction for tax fraud on Friday</a> \u2013 describing the verdict, which remains subject to two levels of appeal, as \"political\" and \"intolerable\". But his words were positively restrained compared to the ones used by the Catania president, Antonio Pulvirenti, after his team had a perfectly good goal chalked off in their 1-0 home defeat to the <em>Bianconeri</em>.</p> <p>\"Today we witnessed the death of football,\" said Pulvirenti. It was his contention that the goal had not been ruled out by the referee, but instead \"was disallowed by the Juventus bench\".</p> <p>Certainly the officials' decision-making process in the 26th minute at the Stadio Angelo Massimino had left a lot to be desired. Gonzalo Bergessio was in a clear onside position when Nicol\u00e1s Spolli met Giovanni Marchese's cross from the left with a downward header towards the right-hand corner of Gigi Buffon's goal. The ball struck the foot of the post and rebounded back out into the six-yard box, <a href=\"http://www.101greatgoals.com/gvideos/shocking-decision-gonzalo-bergessio-catania-goal-ruled-out-v-juventus/\" title=\"\">where Bergessio prodded it home</a>.</p> <p>Initially, the referee Andrea Gervasoni signalled that the goal had been awarded. The linesman Luca Maggiani, whose flag had stayed down, also began to walk back towards the centre-circle. Then he stopped and turned around, calling Gervasoni over for a conference. It quickly became apparent that the pair were also discussing the situation with the official behind the goal, Nicola Rizzoli, via their headsets. Approximately 45 seconds later, the call was changed \u2013 with Bergessio ruled to have been offside.</p> <p>At first, confusion reigned \u2013 the stadium continuing to celebrate for some seconds after the decision was overturned \u2013 but that soon gave way to rage. It had not escaped the attention that, en route to the halfway line, Maggiani was confronted by Simone Pepe and other members of the Juventus bench, who had strayed to the edge of their technical area to protest over the goal.</p> <p>Pulvirenti was in no doubt as to what he had seen. \"The linesman had given the goal, but after the complaints from the bench the referee and linesman changed their decision and disallowed it,\" he said. \"It is a scandal, it is embarrassing \u2026 Who decided [that the goal should not stand], Pepe or [Emanuele] Giaccherini? It is becoming hard to continue.\"</p> <p>In reality, of course, it seems unlikely that Maggiani, a top-flight referee since 2000 and an international one since 2004, could have been intimidated by something as mundane as a screaming player standing in his way. Instead this was a mess borne of a lack of conviction in his initial decision. He had wanted to check with Rizzoli whether there was a touch inside the area by any Catania player after Spolli.</p> <p>Rizzoli was clearly in no position to judge the offside, but could confirm that Francesco Lodi had got his boot to the ball as it flew through the area. For Maggiani this was decisive. When Spolli won his header Bergessio was onside, but surely by the time the ball grazed Lodi's boot the striker must have strayed off? The truth was that he hadn't \u2013 the player still clearly onside when the ball passed Lodi \u2013 but now the linesman's memory was playing tricks on him.</p> <p>It was a decision only compounded in the second half, when the same official failed to spot that Nicklas Bendtner was offside in the build-up to Juventus's goal. This was a far more marginal decision, the striker's front foot just barely beyond the defensive line when he was played through by Mirko Vucinic. Bendtner failed to convert the opportunity himself \u2013 his tame first-time effort blocked by Mariano Andujar \u2013 but Arturo Vidal rolled home the rebound.</p> <p>On its own it was an incident that might easily have been forgiven \u2013 even Pulvirenti saying he did not want to protest about that goal afterwards. But taken in the greater context of a match containing Catania's disallowed goal and eventually also a red card for Marchese (even if his two bookings were, in truth, merited), it all played into the old narrative of officials being subject to <em>sudditanza psicologica</em> \u2013 a \"psychological slavery\" \u2013 that causes them to inherently favour the big teams.</p> <p>It was a thesis supported by results elsewhere. Prior to the Juventus game, the only goal in Serie A this weekend had been scored by Milan's Stephan El Shaarawy against Genoa \u2013 and that too ought to have been disallowed after Ignazio Abate strayed offside in the build-up. On Sunday night Chievo would be denied a penalty that could have earned them a draw away to Napoli when Sergio Pellissier was brought down by Hugo Campagnaro.</p> <p>But on a bad day for officials all over the country (and beyond) it was not always the smaller teams who suffered. Lazio's appeals for a spot-kick were rejected when the ball struck Juan Cuadrado's outstretched arm in the area during their loss to Fiorentina, and the <em>Biancocelesti</em> subsequently also had Stefano Mauri's equaliser wrongly disallowed for offside. Roma's Zdenek Zeman accused the referees of having been decisive in his team's collapse from 2-0 up to lose 3-2 at home to Udinese.</p> <p>\"They always say that referees don't decide who wins the league,\" said Zeman. \"In reality it seems to me that to a great extent they do.\"</p> <p>The Juventus result, though, was always going to receive the greatest scrutiny \u2013 extending as it did their unbeaten run to 48 games. Beppe Marotta, the club's general manager, argued afterwards that his team would have won even if Catania's goal had stood, but while it is possible that would have been the case it equally might not. Juve dominated throughout against the Sicilians, but with Andujar in inspired form had never seemed certain of scoring.</p> <p>At full-time, Juventus left the field to a chorus of \"<em>ladri, ladri</em>\" \u2013 \"thieves, thieves\", and it was not long before 'evidence' of a stitch-up was being circulated. Pulvirenti himself, who argued that there was \"more than just <em>sudditanza psicologica</em>\" at play, would claim to have seen a post celebrating Juventus's Scudetto on Maggiani's Facebook profile. In reality it appears that <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Luca-Maggiani/325579754141590\" title=\"\">this was in fact just a 'fan' page</a>, and likely set up by someone else entirely.</p> <p>But it is easy for fans to assume the worst when so many of their darkest suspicions have been proven true in recent years \u2013 from <em>Calciopoli</em> through to the ongoing <em>Calcioscomesse</em> scandal. This was not so much a case of the clock being turned back for Serie A, as a simple maintenance of the status quo.</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 Juventus, then, potentially stand just six days away from completing a half-century of league games without defeat. If a visit from Bologna this Wednesday is unlikely to knock them off course, then the 50th match has the potential to be very challenging indeed. On Saturday Juve host an Inter side who have won all of their eight away games so far this season.</p> <p>\u2022 Inter extended their general winning streak to seven in a row with a 3-1 victory away to Bologna on Sunday, a feat which has been bettered only four times in the club's history. The <em>Nerazzurri</em> are now up to third, just four points behind Juventus. Asked if his team could challenge for the Scudetto, the manager Andrea Stramaccioni, replied: \"There are only nine games gone, so it's not smart to talk about objectives \u2013 only growth. That same growth Juve had last year: when they struggled at the beginning but then found their stride and went on to win the Scudetto.\" We'll take that as a yes, then.</p> <p>\u2022 Lazio might have been unfortunate with some of the refereeing decisions during their defeat to Fiorentina at the Stadio Artemio Franchi, but that shouldn't take away from the quality of football played by the hosts, nor indeed their two exceptional goals. Adem Ljajic had opened the scoring with <a href=\"http://www.101greatgoals.com/gvideos/adem-ljajic-fiorentina-v-lazio\" title=\"\">a fierce and unexpected drive back across his body from outside the box</a>, before Luca Toni executed a stunning swivel and finish in the 90th minute. \"Forget his date of birth,\" advised Gazzetta dello Sport's Luca Calamai. \"Inside the area he can still make the difference.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Likewise, Zeman's protests over a possible offside in the build-up to Udinese's second goal against Roma \u2013 as well as the disputable nature of the penalty award that led to their winner \u2013 should not distract from the fact that his team once again imploded in dramatic fashion at home. Just as against Bologna a month previously, Zeman's Roma had looked like they were on a different planet to their opponents as they tore Udinese apart with spectacular and incisive football in the first half-hour, but promptly came apart at the first sign of adversity. Adding insult to injury was Antonio Di Natale's match-winning penalty \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.101greatgoals.com/gvideos/antoni-di-natale-panenka-penalty-for-udinese-to-go-3-2-up-v-roma\" title=\"\">a 'cucchiaio'</a> of the sort that Francesco Totti had made his trademark at this very stadium.</p> <p>\u2022 Are two managers better than one? That seems to be the conclusion in Cagliari, where the combined efforts of Ivo Pulga and Diego Lopez have led to three consecutive 1-0 wins since they were appointed to replace Massimo Ficcadenti. Pulga is formally the manager, with Lopez his assistant, though it has been suggested that this is more of a job share \u2013 with the latter unable to take the job alone on account of not having the required licences.</p> <p>\u2022 Where would Milan be this season without El Shaarawy? The forward now has six goals in nine Serie A appearances this season. The rest of his team have four between them \u2013 and three of those were scored by Giampaolo Pazzini in a single match.</p> <p><strong>Results</strong>: Bologna 1-3 Inter, Catania 0-1 Juventus, Fiorentina 2-0 Lazio, Milan 1-0 Genoa, Napoli 1-0 Chievo, Pescara 0-0 Atalanta, Roma 2-3 Udinese, Sampdoria 0-1 Cagliari, Siena 0-0 Palermo.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/interactive/2009/jan/08/serie-a-highlights\" title=\"\">Latest Serie A highlights</a></p>",
  "<p>Peter Eriksson, the new head coach of UK Athletics, will adopt a strikingly different tone to his predecessor, Charles van Commenee. The Swede, who has worked as UKA's Paralympic coach since 2009, started his new job on Monday.</p> <p>The clearest measure of the difference between the two coaches came from the triple jumper Phillips Idowu, who could hardly bring himself to say a single good word about Van Commenee. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PhillipsIdowu/status/262875473401483264\" title=\"\">Idowu promptly and pointedly welcomed Eriksson on Twitter</a>. Van Commenee, of course, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/aug/25/charles-van-commenee\" title=\"\">once claimed that that medium was for \"clowns and attention-seekers\"</a>. Eriksson, on the other hand, cheerfully admits to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Head1Coach\" title=\"\">having a Twitter account himself</a>.</p> <p>Eriksson, who says he is \"more of a quiet personality\", will be working alongside the performance director Neil Black. Black explained that compared with Van Commenee's approach to disputes with athletes, \"Peter's and my style is probably a little bit more 'let's sit down, let's discuss it, give me your opinion, and then we will come to a decision'.\" That's something, Black said, that \"it appeared as though Charles didn't do and wasn't interested in\".</p> <p>\"We can disagree,\" Eriksson says of his relations with his athletes, \"But we have to agree to disagree sometimes too.\" That more conciliatory approach already seems to have won over Idowu. Eriksson said that he had got to know Idowu at a training camp in Italy in 2011. \"I had many meals with him and I find him a really nice guy,\" he said. \"We talk a lot about our children, so we have a common interest and we get along great.\" Idowu echoed that exact thought on Twitter. \"Happy 4 Peter Eriksson,\" he wrote. \"Met him in Italy a few yrs ago &amp; he was actually coaching (not just a title). We had a nice convo about his kids.\"</p> <p>Eriksson and Black intend to ask athletes and their coaches to set their own targets. Changes will be imposed on athletes or coaches only if they fail to meet those targets. \"You have to come and ask, 'What are you guys doing?' and 'How is it working?'\" Eriksson explained. \"Then ask, if it's not working, why is it not working?\" He and Black share a vision. They want to empower individual athletes and coaches with more control over what they do, while at the same time making them more accountable for their own failures. \"They&#xa0;have to be clear that if their way doesn't work, then we have to make changes.\"</p> <p>At the same time Eriksson was keen to stress that he is not a soft touch, even if he has a less autocratic approach than Van Commenee. \"If you hire coaches to do a job, let them do the job,\" he explained. \"You have to listen to what their needs&#xa0;are to enable them to do the job. So listening is important. But is it going to be soft love? No, if they don't live up to the standard, then it's going to be tough love.\"</p> <p>Eriksson, 59, used to compete as a speed skater for Sweden. He says that \"track and field was always my first love\". In fact he and Van Commenee used to share a coach when Eriksson did some cross-training as an athlete in the summer. \"I did run 100 metres and I did the long jump,\" he said with a chuckle. \"Was it far or fast? No, it was probably below average, but I made it to the sand pit.\" In recent years he has been working in Paralympic Sport, in both Great Britain and the USA. He argues that his role as Paralympic head coach meant that he had a good grounding in how UKA works. \"I have been part of the system here for the past four years. It's not just been about the Paralympics. We worked very closely with Olympic coaches across the whole programme, although for me it was the Paralympic side.\"</p> <p>Eriksson was also a key figure in the controversial \"Own the Podium\" programme in Canada, which controlled elite athlete funding between 2005 and 2009. There, perhaps, lies just a hint of the harder attitude that is, reputedly, hidden behind Eriksson's avuncular exterior. Black insisted that one of key reasons that UKA had chosen Eriksson was that \"has always demonstrated that there is no way he is going to compromise. We will take that approach as far as we can.\"</p> <p>Van Commenee, of course, was never one to compromise either. And for all the spats, rows and rucks he created along the way, he did deliver those four gold medals at the 2012 Olympics.</p> <p>So Eriksson was quick to acknowledge that there were some similarities between the two men.</p> <p>\"The outcome is the same: we want to perform better; we want to have more medals. If you compare me with Charles, those would be the similarities. The things where we are different? Well,\" he said with a smile, \"I have a Twitter account, and he doesn't.\"</p>",
  "<p>Last year, when I co-wrote <a href=\"http://roughguide.to/communityenergy/\">a little book on community energy</a>, it still felt like a niche topic. There was exciting stuff going on around the country but unless you happened to be involved in local green group or living somewhere such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jan/06/free-book-guide-community-energy\">Settle</a> then you probably wouldn't have heard about it. Even if you had, there wouldn't necessarily have be an easy way for you to invest. In the past couple of months, though, a host of new websites and projects have appeared, suggesting that community energy is quickly going mainstream.</p> <p>First out of the stalls, in August, was <a href=\"https://www.abundancegeneration.com/\">Abundance</a> \u2013 a new site enabling individuals to invest savings in community energy projects around the UK. It is still early days for the company, with just a handful of projects listed, but the proposition is attractive, with investments in windfarms giving a payback equivalent to an annual return of 5\u20139%. August also saw a <a href=\"http://www.triodos.co.uk/en/personal/investments/renewables/overview/\">new public share issue for energy investments from Triodos Bank</a>, which has achieve an 8.5% return in the last year. Hot on their heals was <a href=\"http://www.microgenius.org.uk/\">MicroGenius</a>, another matchmaker enabling small-scale investors to buy shares in local energy projects around the country.</p> <p>Then, earlier this month, <a href=\"http://www.solarschools.org.uk/\">Solar Schools</a> began its national rollout. Run by <a href=\"http://1010uk.org/\">10:10</a>, the scheme offers a website and toolkit to enable schools to fund a solar roof by raising micro-donations from the local community. The main aim in this case isn't maximising the number of kilowatts installed but finding a way to give huge numbers of parents, friends, family members and neighbours a positive first experience with low-carbon energy, at the same time as kick-starting a broader environment effort in the schools and their communities \u2013 something that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/apr/30/schools-solar-power-climate-change-community\">worked brilliantly in the pilot scheme</a>. (Full disclosure: <a href=\"http://minormass.com/2011/09/solar-schools/\">I developed this project in its early days</a>.)</p> <p>But community-owned energy isn't only about the small-scale. Also bubbling up are projects such as <a href=\"http://www.trillionfund.com/\">Trillion Fund</a>, which expects to launch soon and plans to create \"new source of funding for renewable energy projects worldwide\". Its name hints at its level of ambition. Then there's Oxford-based <a href=\"http://www.energybank.eu/\">EnergyBank</a>, brainchild of Tim Helweg-Larsen, who has been working away behind the scenes for a couple of years on a project that could eventually drive huge sources of cash into offshore wind \u2013 the vast but largely untapped energy resource that Helweg-Larsen mapped out in the <a href=\"http://www.offshorevaluation.org/\">Offshore Valuation Report</a>. His vision is a world in which large-scale energy installations such as offshore windfarms are \"owned by the people and businesses that use them\".</p> <p>None of this, in itself, is going to solve climate change. But community energy definitely has a role to play. For example, in the case of onshore wind, it can help build local support for planning applications \u2013 which will be crucial if the technology is ever going to gain a real foothold in the UK. A new poll underlined that point this week. As Damian Carrington wrote on Tuesday:</p> <blockquote> <p>The poll showed 49% of people would support a wind turbine being erected within two miles of their home, with 22% against. But if the project were community-owned, support rose to 68% and opposition plummeted to 7%. In Germany, where 65% of its huge renewable energy capacity is community-owned, opposition is much rarer than in UK where community ownership is less than 10%.</p> </blockquote> <p>Solar projects tend to be smaller scale and the technology is more expensive per unit of energy generated. But there's plenty of anecdotal and academic evidence to suggest that adding solar to buildings \u2013 whether homes or community buildings \u2013 can have remarkable effects in terms of <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421507000651\">reducing energy demand</a> and increasing engagement with energy and climate issues more broadly.</p> <p>The government, in principle, supports all this. The energy and climate secretary, Ed Davey, says community projects are \"vital to our vision of the development of energy in the UK\" and his department plans to publish a community energy strategy next year. In the meantime, though, the <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/legislation/energybill2012/energybill2012.aspx\">Electricity Market Reform</a> (EMR) is working its way through parliament and some people in the community energy field are concerned that the changes will hobble the thriving community energy scene.</p> <p>Under the EMR, small-scale green energy projects \u2013 those below 5MW \u2013 qualify for subsidies via the feed-in tariff (Fit), which offers a fixed payment for each unit of low-carbon energy created. But larger projects are funded through a complicated new arrangement called <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/legislation/energybill2012/energybill2012.aspx\">Contracts For Difference</a> (CFD). This system was designed with giant energy projects and big corporates in mind and, as a result, it's hugely offputting for smaller community organisations. Rebecca Willis, an energy consultant working with Co-operatives UK, says the CFDs are \"fiendishly complicated and uncertain\". She points out that \"with a Fit you know what you're going to get. With a CFD it depends on the strike price and the average price on the market.\" This makes it much less attractive to small-scale investors.</p> <p>Even if some community groups are able to navigate the CFD process, they will also face a lower return than the larger energy companies would get for the same project. That's because smaller players usually need to distribute their energy via a power purchasing agreement with one of the \"big six\" energy companies rather than selling it directly into the wholesale market. As a result, Willis says, \"the same wind turbine will get 20\u201330% less if it's owned by a community than if it's owned by E.ON.\"</p> <p>For these two reasons, community energy projects will be faced with what Willis describes as \"a perverse incentive to do stuff under 5MW\". That not only seems unfair and unambitious. It also means a whole tier of potential energy projects may not get off the ground because while community projects are effectively being capped at 5MW, big commercial investors \"won't get out of bed for less than 25MW\", Willis says.</p> <p>If the government is serious about community energy's potential, it should tweak the EMR rules to accommodate larger-scale community projects as well as finding ways to encourage and support smaller-scale ones. None of this is incompatible with enabling giant-scale energy projects too \u2013 including nuclear and CCS as well as renewables. It just means giving community energy a fair chance to break out beyond the microscale.</p>",
  "<p>It was a film that inspired Professor Matt Waite to set up the <a href=\"http://www.dronejournalismlab.org/\" title=\"\">Drone Journalism Lab</a>. It begins with a man walking across a field, carrying a large metal briefcase. He stops, opens it, revealing what looks like a model aircraft. Using a tablet computer, he selects part of the surrounding area on a digital map, then transfers the flight plan to the model aircraft and launches it into the sky. It flies on autopilot, taking thousands of pictures before landing in a pre-programmed zone. The man removes a memory stick from the device and uploads the data for processing. A few hours later, he's viewing a high-definition terrain map compiled from the photos.</p> <p>This isn't a science fiction movie. It's the product demo for the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxnWmc0ZTvA\" title=\"\">Gatewing X100</a>, one of a number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that anyone can buy today. These machines, commonly known as drones, are already used by the military, the police and the agricultural industry for a variety of purposes \u2013 some bloody, some benign and some seemingly designed to provoke people into quoting from George Orwell's 1984.</p> <p>But when Waite, an award-winning investigative reporter, stumbled across the X100 during a visit to a major geographical technology event, he was immediately struck by how it could be used for journalism.</p> <p>\"My reporter brain went 'well there's every tornado, every hurricane, I've ever covered'. This device would be able to do hyper-accurate damage-assessment maps in a matter of hours. With traditional reporting techniques, it takes days, if not weeks. We could rapidly change the way we cover disasters by using UAVs.\"</p> <p>He took out his credit card, hoping to buy an X100 and begin experimenting. But there were two problems: firstly, they cost around \u00a340,000; secondly, it's illegal to fly one in United States airspace. So Waite went home empty handed.</p> <p>Still, he couldn't shake the idea of using drones for journalism. So with the help of a $50,000 (\u00a330,000) grant and the support of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, he founded the Drone Journalism Lab to explore the technical, ethical and legal issues.</p> <h2>Getting off the ground</h2> <p>With the X100 way beyond his budget, Waite turned to a \u00a3200 off-the-shelf drone, the <a href=\"http://ardrone.parrot.com/parrot-ar-drone/select-site\" title=\"\">Parrot AR</a>. This small, lightweight device can be controlled using a smartphone or tablet. It's also able to stream real-time HD video footage to a computer.</p> <p>Of course, bigger drones that can carry bulky news cameras and fly for long periods cost thousands of pounds more. But that's still cheap compared with the cost of hiring a helicopter or plane to capture aerial footage.</p> <p>\"If you don't have the kind of huge budget you need to keep a helicopter around all the time, then suddenly this becomes an interesting opportunity,\" says Professor Robert G Picard, of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, University of Oxford. The institute is staging a <a href=\"http://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/about/news/item/article/workshop-will-explore-issues-in-the.html\" title=\"\">drone journalism workshop</a> on 22 October.</p> <p>However, the day when Sky News trades in its \"SkyCopter\" for a drone is still some way off. For starters, Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) <a href=\"http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP722.pdf\" title=\"\">regulations</a> make it difficult to fly a drone in built-up areas \u2013 the very places where a news drone would be most effective. They can't be flown further than 500 meters from the operator, or higher than 400 feet, which limits their usefulness for news gathering.</p> <p>The situation could change in a few years time: a European Commission <a href=\"http://dronewarsuk.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/ec-swd_civilrpas.pdf\" title=\"\">working paper</a> released in September outlines plans to open up European civil airspace to unmanned drones by 2016 (a similar law will come into effect in 2015 in the US), which would allow them to operate alongside manned aircraft.</p> <p>Some major media organisations are already experimenting with drone technology, though. The BBC's research and development department has been <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/researchanddevelopment/2012/04/collab-soton-uav.shtml\" title=\"\">working with Southampton University</a> students to kit out a UAV with BBC broadcast cameras. And in Australia, where commercial drone activity has been licensed since 2002, the news programme 60 Minutes caused a stir last year when it flew a small UAV over an <a href=\"http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/newshome/9382555/spy-in-sky-over-island-camp/\" title=\"\">immigration detention centre</a>.</p> <p>But it's activists, academics and a small army of DIY drone enthusiasts who are really driving the nascent drone journalism movement. For example, during the Occupy Wall Street protests, a modified Parrot AR II drone, dubbed the \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/dec/21/occupy-wall-street-occucopter-tim-pool\" title=\"\">occucopter</a>\", was used to stream live footage over the internet. Protests in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3OB_4BT1LA\" title=\"\">Poland</a> and <a href=\"http://www.airpano.com/360Degree-VirtualTour.php?3D=Moscow-Bolotnaya-Square-Rally&amp;set_language=2\" title=\"\">Moscow</a> have also been filmed and photographed with drones.</p> <h2>Ethical questions</h2> <p>Of course, UAVs could also be used for less noble kinds of journalism, giving rise to a host of privacy and civil liberty issues. For example, one can easily imagine swarms of paparazzi drones following unfortunate celebrities, or hovering above their Hello-exclusive weddings. Nevertheless, Waite believes existing privacy laws will cover many of these eventualities.</p> <p>\"The question I often ask myself is this: is this a new ethical problem, or is this an old ethical problem involving new tools?\" He says the furore over the topless photographs of Kate Middleton illustrates the point. \"A lot of people beyond Buckingham Palace believe that was a pretty gross violation of privacy. So does the fact that a UAV could have been used change that at all? It doesn't.\"</p> <p>Matthew Schroyer, a drone and data journalist, and the founder of the <a href=\"http://www.dronejournalism.org/\" title=\"\">Professional Society of Drone Journalists</a>, has created a drone journalism <a href=\"http://www.dronejournalism.org/wiki/code-of-ethics\" title=\"\">code of ethics wiki</a> to encourage discussion of these issues. \"I think we can meet the challenge together as a group if we abide by codes of conduct,\" he says, adding: \"There's a lot of value to be had from these flying robots, as long as we use them ethically.\"</p> <p>Although drone journalism can't take off properly while commercial restrictions remain in place, Waite believes this is also a blessing in disguise. \"It [drone journalism] is not here yet because the law says it can't be,\" he says. \"But that's also a gift. The time we have between now and 2015 in the US, or anything from 2016 to 2020 in the EU, will give journalists the opportunity to really think about how they're going to use this technology.\"</p> <p>Duncan Jefferies is a <a href=\"http://www.duncanjefferies.co.uk/\" title=\"\">freelance journalist</a>.</p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up</strong></a><strong> for free membership to the </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

It is hauntingly atmospheric, with a pervading aura of romantic decay, which presents a real conservation challenge. In 1850 John Wilton acquired the building \u2013 made up of a pub and concert room \u2013 and the neighbouring properties and constructed a much larger hall. It's alleged that Wilton's was the scene of the first London display of the cancan after which it was immediately banned.  The entrance hall is simply the enclosed paved yard of the original tavern. A narrow staircase leads to a warren of small supper rooms tainted with the aura of scandalous liaisons.

The plush interior is an amalgamation of art deco, neo-classical and Oriental motifs to create an exotic venue for the increasingly affluent teenagers of the 1960s. The spectacular ballroom has a raised viewing dias, stage and a purpose-built sprung Canadian maple dance floor.

But the truth is they don't especially need to. As recent events have demonstrated yet again, any \"driverless\" Underground future is a long, long way off, while persistent claims and beliefs that its advent would instantly make Tube strikes history are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/davehillblog/2012/feb/29/boris-johnson-driverless-underground-trains\">guff</a> - the sort of guff put about by the Evening Standard <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/mayor/ill-curb-power-of-tube-unions-says-boris-7497507.html\">earlier this year</a> as it strove to get Boris Johnson re-elected as mayor. I quote:</p> <blockquote> <p>Boris Johnson today vowed to reduce the power of union bosses by introducing driverless trains.</p> </blockquote> <p>That simple, right? Wrong. </p> <p>Let's get up to speed. First came <a href=\"http://www.eastlondonlines.co.uk/2012/10/transport-union-hits-back-at-boris-and-tfl-after-conflicting-statements-over-driverless-trains/\">a contradiction</a> between Johnson's rhetoric at the Conservative Party conference on 9 October and what London Underground chief Mike Brown said a few days later. </p> <p>We will bring in driverless trains, even if Bob Crow doesn't like it, declared the cheer-seeking mayor in Manchester. \"Good old Boris!\" the grassroots Tories cried, little knowing or perhaps caring that they were being conned. Then came the weekend: \"There are no plans to test driverless trains on any part of the network,\" said Brown.</p> <p>The following Thursday, Brown elaborated for the benefit of the London Assembly's transport committee. <a href=\"http://www.londonreconnections.com/2012/transport-committee-part-1-underground-reliability-driverless-trains/\">London Reconnections</a> has neatly summed up what he said:</p> <blockquote> <p>LU plan to explore greater levels of automatic operation [but] as Brown pointed out, discussion of what level of automation might be possible let alone when it might take place, skips past a far more critical point \u2013 that Transport for London have yet to negotiate a funding settlement with the Government that will enable them to upgrade those lines [that might be upgraded] at all. Indeed there was a hint of frustration lurking within his comments on the subject. \"First of all,\" Brown commented, \"if I could just be clear, we have no money, there is no order, and there is no design.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Brown later told Lib Dem Caroline Pidgeon that the soonest a new fleet of so-called \"driverless\" trains could possibly be introduced would be the 2020s. But what is meant by \"driverless\" in the first place? </p> <p>At the core of the \"driverless-Tube-will-break-the-unions\" scam is the exploitation of confusion about terms. Many Tube trains are already \"driverless\" in the sense that on-board staff members located in cabs, like the one who assisted 007, normally perform only limited functions in a system that is already highly-automated. </p> <p>Even big supporters of a \"driverless\" future acknowledge that \"driverless\" Tube trains would still be staffed, probably by \"train captains\" based in the carriages as on the Docklands Light Railway. These DLR train captains are unionised, with the RMT laying claim to most of them. </p> <p>Unless the law of the land changes, these people would still be entitled to go on strike as DLR train captains are now. It may be that other staff could more easily replace them, as less training to do the job is required. But LU's boss didn't make this point at transport committee. Labour's Tom Copley asked: \"Presumably with a train captain model, you're in the same situation as you are if the drivers go on strike?\" Brown gave a straightforward answer: \"Yes.\"</p> <p>So there we have it. Like 007's Tube adventure in Skyfall, talk of imminent \"driverless\" trains crushing Tube union power is a fantasy - one that Mayor Johnson and his media cheerleaders appear quite happy for Londoners to continue mistaking for reality.</p> <p><em>Read the full and detailed report of London Reconnections <a href=\"http://www.londonreconnections.com/2012/transport-committee-part-1-underground-reliability-driverless-trains/\">here</a>.

  "<p>Arguing about science&#xa0;with Simon Jenkins is like trying to wrestle with a fart \u2014 you can't miss the odious stink but there's almost nothing to get hold of.</p> <p>His recent&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/25/italy-earthquake-laquila-banknote-predict\">opinion piece in the Guardian</a>&#xa0;about Italian seismologists being sent to jail for failing to properly inform the people of L'Aquila in 2009 about the risks of a major earthquake blew up into a now familiar diatribe against the elevated status he believes science has claimed for itself.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"Science has rarely enjoyed greater status. Schools are in thrall to it. Broadcasters grovel at its feet, with hours of programmes devoted to children gazing adoringly at scientific researchers, depicted as funny, garrulous, lovable role models. Science has taken the place of religion in a cocoon of uncritical certainty. Those who claim the title \"scientist\", be it natural or social, expect to combine the immunity of diplomats and the infallibility of popes. Science is merging into scientology.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>There is so much wrong with that paragraph it is difficult to know where to start. In the article Jenkins also wrongly conflates the technical responsibilities of a cook or an engineer with those of scientists charged to predict the behaviour of systems that science readily acknowledges it does not fully understand. Neither does he pause to consider what is properly meant by risk or probability. Finally, he reserves his greatest ire for meteorologists:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"The gloomy Met Office, seemingly in the pay of the outbound tourism trade, is reckless with other people's livelihoods.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Jenkins has the presence of mind to include the word 'seemingly' in that sentence, so as to avoid being sued for libel. But in doing so he reveals he has no evidence that the Met Office has been bribed by nefarious tour operators. And so his argument evaporates in a puff of malodorous smoke.</p> <p>The carelessness with which he lays out his case, and the lack of any compelling detail, suggests that it is in fact Jenkins who considers himself incapable of error, at least when he is writing about science. The first time I reacted to one of his articles, I tried to do so&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/feb/11/scientists-peer-review-research\">with reasoned argument</a>; the second time&#xa0;<a href=\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2010/06/28/urgent_new_priority_for_uk_science/\">I went for mockery</a>. Neither approach seemed to have any effect.&#xa0;However, I am a flawed, fallible scientist \u2014 my <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephen_curry/status/261739131191832577\">initial reaction on Twitter</a>&#xa0;to his piece was angry and, I have to confess, hardly constructive \u2014 so although I failed the first time, I would like to give reasoned argument another go.</p> <p>I don't find it easy to penetrate the haze of Jenkins' anger with science and scientists. It drove his argument almost to incoherence. He wants scientists to be held to account but somehow also felt that making the Italian seismologists stand trial and face prison for their failings was inappropriate. His conflicting stance hinted at the real complexity of the issue but he opted not to engage with it.</p> <p>The difficulty as far as I can see it is that Jenkins hasn't tried very hard to understand either the particular court case that concluded in Italy with a conviction last week or the varied reactions of the scientific community. He has overlooked, for example, this <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110914/full/477264a.html\">2011 article in Nature</a> that not only explained the detailed&#xa0;background to the charges brought against the Italian scientists but also reported comments from other scientists such as Thomas Jordan, an American seismologist, who was critical of the way that the scientists on the commission communicated risk to the local population in L'Aquila. This thoughtful <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110914/pdf/477251a.pdf\">analysis from volcanologist Willy Aspinall</a>, also from Nature in 2011, would have shown Jenkins the falsity of his claim that waving a banknote is enough to deflect the considered views of any pundit.&#xa0;</p> <p>But the most annoying thing about Jenkins's piece is that he has a point. It might have been difficult to spot in the midst of his bilious rant but the scientific community needs to be careful in presenting commentary \u2014 and recommendations \u2014 on matters of serious public interest. The Royal Society and the US National Academy of Sciences did us no favours by <a href=\"http://royalsociety.org/news/2012/italian-earthquake-scientists/\">issuing a curt statement</a> that simply condemned the decision of the Italian court. There was no critical assessment of the particular actions of the scientists that had raised the concerns of the people of L'Aquila. The absence of nuance failed to reflect the realities of the case and shaded into an arrogance that served neither the public nor the scientific community.</p> <p>This would be grist to the Jenkins mill were it not for the fact that neither the Royal Society nor the US National Academy properly represents the views of scientists. It needs to be borne in mind, on all sides, that the scientific community is far from homogenous, so a parade of caricatures in newspaper opinion pieces serves little good. Nor does a knee jerk reaction to such opinion. Fortunately, against the brief statement from science's grandees we can place much more considered analyses from the likes of social scientist&#xa0;<a href=\"http://blogs.nottingham.ac.uk/makingsciencepublic/2012/10/25/the-impact-of-earthquakes-on-making-science-public/\">Brigitte Nerlich</a>, statistician&#xa0;<a href=\"http://understandinguncertainty.org/continuing-tragedy-l'aquila\">David Spiegelhalter</a>, and seismologist <a href=\"http://tremblingearth.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/conviction-of-italian-seismologists-a-nuanced-warning/\">Austin Elliot</a>&#xa0;(the latter's analysis is particularly good).&#xa0;</p> <p>If scientists are ever to win round the likes of Simon Jenkins \u2014 and I suggest we keep trying \u2014&#xa0;we have to put away the indignation and find ways of conversing with him. Let's start with courtesy, and discussion of the evidence.</p>",

Justice demands that this opportunity should also prosper indigenous and other forest dependant peoples. This requires a better investment model.</p> <p>Investing in Locally Controlled Forestry (ILCF) has emerged over the last three years <a href=\"http://environment.yale.edu/tfd/uploads/TFDReview_ILCF_FINAL_LO-RES.pdf\" title=\"\">as a strong candidate for this better investment model</a>. Dialogues in nine countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America were convened by The Forest Dialogue (TFD) and funded by the Growing Forest Partnership (GFP) initiative and the government of Sweden (where <a href=\"http://environment.yale.edu/tfd/uploads/TFD_ILCF_Sweden_Background.pdf\" title=\"\">100 years of ILCF has already taken place</a>. More than 400 people pooled their expertise.</p> <p>Those looking at what was working, and what was not, included not only investors and forest experts, but also representatives of forest rights-holder organisations such as the Global Alliance for Community Forestry, the International Alliance of Indigenous and Tribal People's of the Tropical Forests and the International Family Forest Alliance \u2013 k<a href=\"http://www.g3forest.org/index.cfm\" title=\"\">nown collectively as the G3</a>.</p> <p>The G3 define locally controlled forestry (LCF) as: \"The local right for forest owner families and communities to make decisions on commercial forest management and land use, with secure tenure rights, freedom of association and access to markets and technology.\"</p> <p>Locally controlled forestry is big news. Forests under some form of local control make up 25% of the world's forests and provide US$75-US$100bn (\u00a347bn-\u00a362bn) a year in goods and services and there are grounds for hoping this will grow. Strong evidence over the last 60 years documents <a href=\"http://www.growingforestpartnerships.org/sites/growingforestpartnerships.org/files/gfp_GFP_locallycontrolledforestry.pdf\" title=\"\">how LCF often outperforms alternatives such as concessions in economic terms</a> and protected areas in environmental terms.</p> <p>Investing in locally controlled forestry (ILCF) is a paradigm shift \u2013 away from capital seeking forest resources and needing labour \u2013 towards local rights-holders managing forest resources and seeking capital. It recognises the need to distinguish and blend two types of investment:</p> <p>\u2022 Asset investment (conventional investment in which the nominal value of underlying capital is expected to increase or at least not fall) and;</p> <p>\u2022 Enabling investment (in which capital is foregone to build the self-sufficiency and attractiveness of the business in question).</p> <p><strong>Clever ways to encourage investors</strong></p> <p>Asset investors shy from investing in local controlled forestry for four main reasons: insecure local commercial forest rights (on which to base a deal); lack of business capacity (to seal the deal); lack of commercial organisation (to make scale worth the costs of due diligence); and a lack of brokers (to match those between whom a deal might be struck).</p> <p>A clever mix of four types of enabling investment is needed to pave the way for asset investment and packaging up enabling and asset investment cleverly can boost asset investor's confidence.</p> <p>A field visit to the shea butter forests of Burkina Faso is one of many examples, including another in Ethiopia, where four types of enabling investment were used. The Union of Women Producers of Shea Products of Sissili and Ziro was established in 2001 (it became the Nununa Federation in 2011) and processes nuts into shea butter for a range of products like soaps and creams.</p> <p>Enabling investment to negotiate more secure commercial forest rights for shea currently comes from NGO supporters of small forest enterprises such as <a href=\"http://www.treeaid.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Tree Aid</a>. But in the interim, Nununa members have circumscribed 3,345 hectares of shea-tree protection areas managed by their members. Enabling investment in business capacity development has come from the cosmetics company L'Occitane, which agreed a commercial deal to buy Shea from 600 women subject to certain quality specifications that then attracted technical partners for development such as the Centre for Study and International Co-operation and the Dutch Interchurch Organisation for Development.</p> <p>Enabling investment to achieve investible scale also came from SNV and Nununa itself. Nununa started as a union among 18 district-wide groups, but now comprises 4,596 members, a growth of 156% in comparison with 2,985 members in 2009. Technical support to achieve fairtrade certification in 2006 and organic certification in 2007 further strengthened the track record.</p> <p>Finally, enabling investment to broker a commercial deal came from SNV whose support to develop a new business model included an investment proposal for the construction of a small factory for the industrial processing of shea butter. A fully mechanised and more efficient production facility was installed with loan finance from the Agridius Foundation.</p> <p>Production costs per kilo of butter decreased by a half from 1.68 \u20ac/kg to 0.86 \u20ac/kg (\u00a31.4/kg to 0.69/kg) and production volumes doubled. More than 4,000 members have achieved a 95% increase in income from shea production for less work and more status.</p> <p>Investors are getting acceptable returns. Stronger roles and incentives for local women to control, sustainably manage and even enrich the shea forests have been put in place.</p> <p>Scaling-up can be seen to happen organically across very different forest contexts once this clever packaging of enabling and asset investment is understood and applied \u2013 as numerous cases in the <a href=\"http://www.iied.org/investment-guide-triple-win-locally-controlled-forestry\" title=\"\">guide to investing in locally controlled forestry</a> that was launched at <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/forestry/cofo/en/\" title=\"\">COFO21</a> attest. <a href=\"http://www.growingforestpartnerships.org/forest-farm-facility-mission-and-focus\" title=\"\">A new Forest and Farm Facility</a> hosted by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation was also launched at Committee on Forestry on 28 September precisely to start to inject the right sort of enabling investments into locally controlled forestry.</p> <p><em>Duncan Macqueen is team leader for forests at the </em><a href=\"http://www.iied.org/\" title=\"\"><em>International Institute for Environment and Development</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

Today is supposed to be the last day of the truce to mark Eid al-Adha but reports of attacks continue.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/29/syria-crisis-raids-idUSL5E8LT2DV20121029?rpc=401\">Syrian warplanes have bombarded a rebel stronghold on the edge of Damascus on the fourth and final day of a truce, opposition activists claim</a></strong>. They said jets targeted Harat al-Shwam, a residential neighbourhood a few kilometres east of the capital which President Bashar al-Assad's forces had tried to storm, encountering stiff resistance. Sham News Network, an activist group, said jets also raided farmland adjacent to the northern Damascus neighbourhood of Barzeh and the city of Deir al-Zor in eastern Syria.&#xa0;The ceasefire has been marred by air raids and fighting and, on Sunday, veteran opposition campaigner <a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/o0qANYo1n4A\">Fawaz Tello told Reuters it was \u201cpractically over\u201d</a>.

The bomb landed after clashes between Syrian regime forces and opposition fighters escalated in the Syrian town of Harim, it said. The state-run Anatolia news agency reported that the Turkish army responded immediately with artillery fire. Tensions between the neighbours increased earlier this month after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/03/turkey-syrian-mortar-bomb\">five Turkish civilians were killed by a mortar bomb fired from Syrian territory. </a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2012/10/29/Iraq-finds-no-arms-in-Syria-bound-Iran-jet/UPI-97561351492200/\"><strong>Iraq has searched an Iranian plane bound for Syria to check that it was not carrying weapons</strong>.</a> It was the second such forced landing this month.

  "<p>David Moyes was wrong on one count about Luis Su\u00e1rez. Theatrics may well deter supporters from paying good money to watch a manipulated result but, for better or worse, they cannot divert their gaze from the unavoidable draw that is Liverpool's No7.</p> <p>There was a certain inevitability to the 219th Merseyside derby from the moment the Everton manager condemned Su\u00e1rez and his \"history\" of diving on Friday. Namely, that it would return to bite his Scottish rear. The Uruguay international inflicted two punishing blows with a central role in the Liverpool goals that sparked a vast improvement and pulsating comeback from Everton but he could, and should, have left a deeper imprint at Goodison Park. He was prevented from giving Liverpool the first major Premier League win of the Brendan Rodgers' era only by an assistant referee's errant flag for offside in stoppage time. But Su\u00e1rez being Su\u00e1rez, that was not all.</p> <p>Liverpool's self-illuminated spotlight also responding to Moyes' criticism with a celebratory dive in front of the Everton dugout, one that sparked mock outrage and claims of incitement afterwards. Nonsense, of course. And at least Su\u00e1rez can no longer use the footballers' usual excuse of never having read the papers.</p> <p>Far worse was the spiteful challenge down the back of Sylvian Distin's ankle for which he received a yellow card from referee Andre Marriner. Moyes viewed it a red card offence. Distin was simply lucky his foot was not embedded in the pitch when contact was made, and a break was avoided.</p> <p>All of which detracted from an uncharacteristic open and entertaining derby in which both teams exited with cause for regret and relief. Everton will rue their dreadful start and failure to punish an inexperienced Liverpool team during a dominant, Kevin Mirallas-inspired finale to the first half. Liverpool's regrets lay in stoppage time and the inability to withstand Everton's belligerent reaction to falling two goals behind.</p> <p>Moyes's team began carelessly, slack passing and an exposed midfield the features of their opening, while Liverpool appeared content to counterattack dangerously through Su\u00e1rez and Raheem Sterling throughout. They opened the scoring when Marriner played a good advantage following a foul by Steven Naismith on Suso and allowed Jos\u00e9 Enrique to reach the byline. His low centre evaded the Everton defence, Leighton Baines nudged Sterling aside, a foul according to Rodgers, but the ball fell to Su\u00e1rez at the far post and his low shot struck the left-back and flew in. Su\u00e1rez headed straight for the Everton dugout where, arms folded across chest, he executed a dive in front of Moyes. A quiet word from Marriner sufficed.</p> <p>Six minutes later Su\u00e1rez had a goal of his own when the Everton defence disintegrated at a Steven Gerrard free-kick. The Uruguayan was completely unmarked in front of goal as he glanced a header beyond Tim Howard.</p> <p>Everton needed an instant response to avoid another derby day spent agonising over a wasted opportunity and got one when Brad Jones punched a Baines corner straight to Leon Osman on the edge of his area. Osman drove the return through a packed goalmouth, in off Joe Allen's heel, and the contest was back on.</p> <p>Moyes's side dominated the rest of the opening half with Mirallas the key figure as he tormented the unprotected Liverpool right-back Andre Wisdom. A combination between the Belgians, Mirallas and Marouane Fellaini, conjured a deserved equaliser when the latter drove the ball across the Liverpool goalmouth and Naismith prodded home from close range.</p> <p>Besides the goals, there was enough incident to keep rivalry aflame. There was a booking for a dive by Phil Neville, embarrassingly for Moyes given his pre-match warnings and one that earned his captain a dressing down at the interval. Sterling received a warning before and after being booked for persistent misconduct, with Howard racing from goal to demand a second yellow card for a foul on Baines.</p> <p>Fortunately for Wisdom, though not Everton, the injured Mirallas failed to reappear for a second half in which Rodgers switched to a three-man central defence to stifle Fellaini's aerial threat and get the full-backs to advance. The ploy succeeded defensively. Sterling squandered a glorious chance to restore Liverpool's lead in a second half where they remained dangerous on the break, but Everton maintained overall control. It needed a challenge in keeping with a superb display from Martin Skrtel to prevent Nikica Jelavic converting Seamus Coleman's cross and the Croatian headed badly wide from Baines' inviting free-kick.</p> <p>Despite holding the edge, Everton grew nervous as full-time approached and Liverpool sensed punishment. Everyone thought it had arrived when Su\u00e1rez converted from close range after Sebasti\u00e1n Coates headed down another Gerrard free-kick. Gerrard raced half the length of the field to celebrate before the Liverpool section on his knees, oblivious to play continuing behind him. The assistant referee had flagged for offside, not a foul by Coates as he won the header. Wrongly, it transpired, and Everton were spared.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match </strong>Martin Skrtel (Liverpool)</p>",
  "<h2>Chelsea were not particularly hard done by</h2> <p>In recent times, a lot of hot air has been emitted regarding Manchester United's supposed preferential treatment from referees. Some lunatics genuinely believe there is an official conspiracy involving Sir Alex Ferguson, the FA, the CIA and Nasa. Their attitude will not have been changed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/28/chelsea-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">by events at Stamford Bridge</a>, yet the fuss over Sunday's game is misplaced, a convenient narrative that doesn't stand up to the most basic scrutiny. Fernando Torres should have been sent off long before his dubious second yellow card. Chelsea were not unlucky to be down to nine men; they were lucky not to be down to eight, because Mikel John Obi should have received a second yellow card for fouling Antonio Valencia. Chelsea were the better team at 2-2, but they were about to go 3-2 down when Branislav Ivanovic committed the foul for which he was correctly sent off.</p> <p>And while Javier Hern\u00e1ndez's winner was offside, United would probably have won the game anyway. Hern\u00e1ndez's goal does not significantly impact on the balance sheet of refereeing mistakes in matches between United and Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Since their previous league win at Stamford Bridge in April 2002 United have suffered a series of shocking decisions, most notably in 2002-03, 2007-08, 2009-10 and 2010-11. Two of those almost cost them the league; a couple of mistakes from Martin Atkinson in 2009-10 probably did cost them the title. They were due a decision at Stamford Bridge. They are due a few more before things can be said to have evened themselves out. <strong>Rob Smyth</strong></p> <h2>Me, me, me</h2> <p>At half-time of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/28/manchester-city-swansea-premier-league\">their game at home to Swansea</a>, with the score goalless \u2013 <em>goalless! \u2013</em> Manchester City were booed off the pitch. That's Manchester City, reigning Premier League champions. We often talk about the entitlement of the professional element of the ftbllr generation, but fans can be just as bad \u2013 the same thing happened at Old Trafford a month ago, when a very good Spurs side were thoughtless enough to take a half-time lead: \"How dare you, a team in whose reflected glory I demand to bathe, not sweep aside all opposition, when I, Angry from probably not Manchester, have paid for my ticket\". You can bet that the ingrates responsible were not in attendance when City were travelling to Gillingham and Bristol Rovers and United were losing to Wimbledon and Crystal Palace. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong></p> <h2>Characters not chalkboards</h2> <p>Roberto Mancini has taken plenty of stick for changing his formation this season, but the reality is that players start a match standing on a particular sod, and then spend the rest of it tramping across various others, depending on what happens. And if this sounds simplistic, well, so it should; football is simple not systematic, the best teams defined by personnel and personality, not procedure. Of course formation impacts upon a game, but it's rarely the crucial factor in determining its outcome. In Manchester City's first nine league games last season, Roberto Mancini made 24 changes to his starting line-up compared with 32 at the same stage this, and though there are, perhaps, mitigating factors \u2013 more injuries and trickier fixtures \u2013 consistency of selection is far more significant than consistency of formation when it comes to crafting rhythmic, coherent teams. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong></p> <h2>Mirallas undermined Rodgers' assessment of Everton</h2> <p>Both managers employed diversion tactics <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/28/everton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">after the Merseyside derby</a>. David Moyes focused on Luis Su\u00e1rez and not Everton's inexplicably nervous opening and ending to the game, or failure to hurt Liverpool at 2-2. Brendan Rodgers repeatedly portrayed Everton as a direct, long-ball team after his side squandered a two-goal lead and several of his decisions \u2013 Raheem Sterling starting on the right and Suso starting instead of Jonjo Shelvey \u2013 didn't come off. Rodgers' point missed the target for one good reason - Kevin Mirallas. The Belgium international was the one player who hurt Liverpool time and again at Goodison, never from a long ball, and it was the source of Moyes' frustration \u2013 and surely relief to Rodgers \u2013 that a twisted ankle meant he did not reappear for the second half. Everton's momentum and penetration went with him. <strong>Andy Hunter </strong></p> <h2>Ireland should pick Hoolahan (part two)</h2> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/28/aston-villa-swindon-norwich\">a match of confused endeavour at Villa Park</a>, Wes Hoolahan stood out a mile. Every touch was considered, urgent and purposeful. He is the kind of quietly classy playmaker no team should leave home without, and his awareness and touch are such that he probably wouldn't look out of place playing five-a-sides at La Masia. It's a surprise that he is not playing for a bigger club, and a minor scandal that he is not playing for his country: his only cap for the Republic of Ireland came four years ago, and he could not even get into the squad for Euro 2012. In an Irish team that tends to deal in confused endeavour, Hoolahan would stand out a mile. <strong>Rob Smyth</strong></p> <h2>Market value</h2> <p>Selling RVP for below RRP was not Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's fault, rather that of the contract man also responsible for Samir Nasri's exit and the current impasse with Theo Walcott. On the other hand, attempting to replace him with a bargain 2-4-1 deal cannot be blamed on anybody but the manager. The argument offered is that Arsenal are changing style, their attacking options now more varied and aimed at achieving a more even spread of goals across the squad. The most obvious comparator is the Manchester United side which won the title in 2006-07, after selling Ruud van Nistelrooy, but the context was different. United had Cristiano Ronaldo to take over the principal goalscoring responsibility, Wayne Rooney, before his mid-career crisis took hold, and a proven Premier League striker in Louis Saha \u2013 as well as Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and perhaps the finest back five in the club's history. Arsenal, on the other hand, do not, and though Olivier Giroud and Lukas Podolski are decent players, had the money spent on them gone towards a single outstanding one, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/28/jack-wilshere-arsenal-queens-park-rangers\">Arsenal's prospects would look far better than they do</a>. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong></p> <h2>Modesty would make Berbatov a truly world-class player</h2> <p>We have all played with someone like Dimitar Berbatov, the guy who knows he is gifted, far more talented than those around him, and, as such, almost sees it as an insult that he should be expected to do basic things like run around and close down the opposition. Leave that, he believes, to the carthorses. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/28/reading-fulham-premier-league\">The Bulgarian was at it again on Saturday</a>, quite literally walking around the pitch while his team-mates looked to assert themselves against Reading. But ultimately it was he who shone brightest, delivering a performance of sublime control, movement and finishing to leave those watching wondering what he could achieve if he bothered a little bit more.</p> <p>With respect to Fulham, Berbatov should be at a top-level team, indeed he was until Sir Alex Ferguson ran out of patience and decided that despite his impressive scoring record, he did not fit in at Manchester United. Fulham swooped at the end of the last transfer window and signed Berbatov for a bargain \u00a34m. It is telling that no bigger clubs targeted Berbatov, and that can only be down to his lack of energy and effort on the pitch. If he could add that to his obvious talents there is no doubt that he could still become a key player at a team with ambitions of winning the Champions League. It is as if Berbatov needs to convince himself that he is not as good as he actually is. <strong>Sachin Nakrani </strong></p> <h2>Player plays, player improves</h2> <p>After five seasons of hosannahs and hiccups, Rafael da Silva has finally cemented his place in Manchester United's starting line-up. As all young players do and as all players do, he has made mistakes, but much of the criticism of him is besides the point. Full-backs in the better sides tend to get plenty of the ball, particularly against opponents seeking to frustrate \u2013 making them a crucial attacking option, entitled to rely on their team-mates' ability to cover when they go forward. Similarly, though Rafael can be impetuous in the tackle, his desire to get stuck-in \u2013 often after more muscular team-mates have shrunk away \u2013 is testament to his character not criticism of it; you can't sculpt heart and testicles on the bench-press. Like Anderson and Nani before him, Rafael's good form has coincidentally coincided with his consistent selection, and the manager must resist the temptation to select Phil Jones and Chris Smalling ahead of him when they return simply because they happen to be taller \u2013 a specialist is almost always better than a stop-gap. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong></p> <h2>No need for Sunderland to be coy about their shyness</h2> <p>Sunderland can make legitimate claim to be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/28/stoke-sunderland-premier-league\">the least watchable side in history</a>; in nine games this season, they have mustered a grand total of 12 shots on goal, eight of them from Steven Fletcher. For context, Stoke, Reading and Villa are next lowest with 30. And yet they're not actually a bad side, nor a side playing to avoid defeat; it is just that St\u00e9phane Sess\u00e8gnon, their chief creator and outstanding player last season is horrifically out of form, which is exacerbating the weaknesses of his team-mates; Fletcher is a finisher but unlikely to fashion his own chances, James McClean too one-footed and Adam Johnson taking time to settle in. In that context, Martin O'Neill deserves credit for ensuring that his players defend properly more than criticism for their attacking shortcomings. Once Sess\u00e8gnon rediscovers his touch, Sunderland will improve not only in output but in style. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong></p> <h2>Lukaku looks the part</h2> <p>Should Roberto Di Matteo recall Romelu Lukaku in January? Seemingly Chelsea's manager is pondering such a move and, watching West Brom's lone striker, it was easy to see why. The Belgian youngster bullied Newcastle's defence and forced Tim Krul into a couple of saves before he scored West Brom's equaliser in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/28/newcastle-united-west-brom-premier-league\">their ultimately unlucky 2-1 defeat</a>. Many visiting fans thought Steve Clarke erred in replacing Lukaku with Shane Long midway through the second half. \"We were pleased to see the back of him,\" said Newcastle's Alan Pardew. \"Lukaku's a big talent.\" <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p>",

He denied that his massive liquidity schemes and promise of unlimited bond purchases would fuel inflation.</p> <p>Draghi also rejected claims that the European Central Bank has violated its mandate, and argued that German savers should be pleased, not alarmed \u2013 taxpayers might even make a profit on the ECB's bond purchases.</p> <p>A full transcript of the interview was <a href=\"http://www.ecb.int/press/key/date/2012/html/sp121029.en.html\">uploaded to the ECB's website this morning</a>. It begins with Spiegel inquiring whether the ex-Goldmanite has any savings (!) before giving Draghi a vigorous grilling.</p> <p>Here are some highlights.</p> <p>On sovereignty:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has proposed giving the EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs a direct say in national budgets. What do you think of that proposal?</p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> I am fully in favour of it. Governments would be wise to seriously consider it. I firmly believe that, in order to restore confidence in the euro area, countries need to transfer part of their sovereignty to the European level.</p> <p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> But it is precisely that that many governments are unwilling to do. Why are they so against it?</p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> A lot of governments have yet to realise that they lost their national sovereignty a long time ago. Because, in the past, they have allowed their debt to pile up, they now need the goodwill of the financial markets. That sounds like a paradox, but it is nonetheless true: it is only once the euro area countries are willing to share sovereignty at the European level that they will gain sovereignty.</p> </blockquote> <p>And on German fears:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> In Germany, people have several reservations about your crisis policies. Were you surprised to receive so much criticism?</p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> I had the opportunity of a very deep and wide-ranging exchange of views with members of the Bundestag last Wednesday. My impression was that I was able to explain a number of issues, in particular how the measures comply with our mandate to safeguard our independence and to ensure price stability in the medium term.</p> <p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> This fear stems from historical experience. Germans have learnt that, if central banks flood the markets with money, this always leads to inflation.</p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> We have to take these fears very seriously. But the correlation is not so simple. In some cases, such as in the Weimar Republic, printing money caused inflation. But in other cases, proactive central bank action did not.</p> </blockquote> <p>Draghi is clearly keen to assuage German concerns \u2013 last Wednesday he spent two hours at the Bundestag answering MPs questions. <em>Preparing the ground before Angela Merkel seeks parliamentary approval for new support for Greece, Spain and/or Cyprus, perhaps....</em></p> </div>   </div>",
  "<p>Millions of pounds are too often wasted in the way the NHS purchases products and services, from swabs to stationery. Until the health sector bites the bullet and gets its procurement house in order the financial impact of health reforms will achieve only partial success.</p> <p>At County Durham and Darlington NHS foundation trust we have been through a major restructuring and a complete overhaul of our approach to procurement, leading to an upgrade of our skills and systems.</p> <p>In 2011, the merger of the foundation trust with local PCTs led to changes in the way local health services were to be delivered, with a far greater focus on integrating services. The trust was split into three clinical care groups: care closer to home; surgery and diagnostics; and acute and long term. The newly defined groups meant procurement now needed to act as a partnership to these three distinct care groups, each with very specific and varied purchasing requirements.</p> <p>Each group has a designated procurement representative involved in decision making at both a strategic and business level. This gives our procurement group visibility and credibility as consultative advisors on the products and services best suited to fulfilling each care group's strategy, while the care groups have the distinct advantage of being able to engage with procurement in the early stages of planning.</p> <p>Our long term objective as an NHS trust has always been to achieve clear visibility of our 'cost per patient' and our trust is also the leader of a regional public sector purchasing consortium. This is going through major change to decentralise purchasing, making it as easy and as simple as possible for our large user community to buy the products and services they need.</p> <p>It is obviously critical to have the right information about suppliers, products and prices. For this, we use a system called <a href=\"http://www.waxdigital.com/blog/index.php/cs-nhs/\" title=\"\">Wax Digital web3 Source to Pay</a>, which has cut our admin and increased our ability to see our costs clearly. Without it, the procurement team could not support the new care groups with information and strategic guidance in the way we do. Another wider benefit is that accurate forecasting information has aided the process of integrated decision making among the groups' new teams.</p> <p>We are developing our procurement systems in other ways, too. We want to make interaction with suppliers fully automated and integrated into the purchasing process, to ensure any queries can be dealt with at the beginning of the process rather than at the end, as a query on an invoice. We also want all our orders to be as accurate as possible. For these reasons, we have added the ability to manage suppliers and contracts to our systems and identified 300 suppliers that will be added to our supplier portal.</p> <p>Suppliers can now simply post their invoices on the portal, reducing printing and postage costs. They will also able to upload and self manage their catalogues on the system, to give us the most up-to-date information and pricing \u2013 that's especially important with catering items like fresh fruit and vegetables, where prices could fluctuate week by week.</p> <p>By the end of 2012 we want to be an organisation where procurement is woven into the very fabric of our business objectives, creating a model where product and service choices are realistic but not excessive. We have put purchasing and requisitioning further in the hands of our users, so they can easily order what they need, with reduced administrative cost, but with the ability to keep maverick spending fully under control.</p> <p>I believe that within our consortium we have created a model for procurement that could be used across the entire NHS, if not the public sector as a whole.</p> <p>At the moment many organisations are purchasing the same products and services with public money in silos. They are not getting best value and there is no visibility of spend or the potential to control it.</p> <p>Health reform needs to be clearly focused on the most effective way of delivering the most needed health services for the country \u2013 but cost efficiency has to be part of this too.</p> <p><em>Malcolm Preston is associate director of procurement at County Durham and Darlington NHS foundation trust</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Public Leaders Network, email public.leaders@guardian.co.uk.

  "<p>Hurricane Sandy has forced Google to postpone an event on Monday morning in New York where it planned to show off its partners' newest \"Nexus\" smartphones \u2013 though enough detail has already leaked out ahead of time to describe the phones and tablets it was expected to show off.</p> <p>Following a number of <a href=\"http://bgr.com/2011/06/15/exclusive-google-nexus-4g-detailed-720p-display-4g-lte-android-4-0/\">leaks</a> <a href=\"http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=be&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ftech.onliner.by%2F2012%2F10%2F12%2Flg-nexus-4-review%2F\">online</a>, UK retailer Carphone Warehouse last week was <a href=\"http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/48155/nexus-4-revealed-in-carphone-warehouse-preorder-page\">spotted by Pocket Lint showing a page</a> with full details about a phone made by struggling handset maker LG that is expected to be the next \"Nexus 4\": it has a 4.7in display, 1280x768 screen resolution (giving it a pixel density of 320ppi), have an 8MP rear camera, panoramic photo capture system and NFC. It is also expected to have a 1.5GHz quad-core processor, LTE connectivity in the US, and 8GB of onboard storage.</p> <p>As is standard with Google's \"Nexus\" models, there is no SD card option for expanding the onboard storage. It is expected to run Android 4.2 \u2013 though it's unclear whether that constitutes a full or minor upgrade to Android compared with its 4.1.2 version. </p> <p>One report <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/google/2012/10/21/revealed-everything-that-google-will-announce-at-its-android-event-on-october-29/\">at The Next Web</a> says that Android 4.2 will introduce a \"sharing\" option so that multiple users can swap logins on a single tablet \u2013 an option that would be especially attractive to families and businesses.</p> <p>Carphone Warehouse was taking pre-orders on Nexus 4 phone contracts beginning at \u00a331 per month with no upfront cost. The site page where it showed them was unavailable on Monday morning.</p> <p>LG has been making losses in the handset business for about two years, and the unveiling was to be its first time making Google's \"reference\" Nexus model. Previous Nexus models have been made by HTC and Samsung. While the products have not in the past been big sellers \u2013 because they do not get widespread carrier support \u2013 for owners they usually provide a faster track to Android updates than other handsets.</p> <p>In an embarrassing twist for Google, <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/10/drinking-establishment-check-highly-anticipated-mobile-phone-release-check-lost-phone-check\">one of its staff left the LG \"Nexus 4\" phone in a bar</a> near its Silicon Valley offices in September - the same problem Apple faced in 2010 when one of its staff, Gray Powell, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/apr/19/new-iphone-review-found-bar\">left an iPhone 4 prototype in a bar</a> in nearby Redwood City. That phone was sold on for thousands of dollars, and led to police searches of a journalist's home following an article on Gizmodo.</p> <p>According to Wired, Google was no more peaceful about the loss of its phone: a friend of Jamin Barton, the bartender who found the device, described the Google staffer to Wired as \"little but really pushy, like military \u2026. He said he wanted to keep me out of trouble \u2013 like I was in any kind of trouble \u2013 keep the bar out of trouble. They could file criminal charges, he said.\"</p> <p>Google's staffer eventually recovered the phone, offering Barton a free model if he would keep quiet about it until after the launch.</p> <p>The search giant was also expected to show off one and possibly two tablets on Monday before being forced to postpone the event in New York. A version of its Nexus 7 tablet \u2013 possibly with 3G connectivity, and almost certainly with 32GB of storage rather than the current 16GB limit \u2013 and a \"Nexus 10\" tablet built by Samsung were both anticipated.</p> <p>According to leaked details from Argos <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/google/2012/10/17/uk-retailer-argos-confirms-google-to-offer-32gb-nexus-7-available-for-199-99/\">reported by The Next Web</a>, the 32GB Wi-Fi version will cost \u00a3199.99 and be available some time in November. </p> <p>The Samsung tablet is expected to offer 2560x1600 pixels for 300ppi resolution in a 10in tablet, ahead of the just-announced new Apple iPad's 264ppi. Vic Gundotra, head of Google's mobile side, has posted a number of pictures on his Google+ profile whose EXIF data indicates that they were taken with a \"Nexus 10\" device.</p>",
  "<p>Claims management companies that have made billions of pounds from PPI are turning their attention to mortgages in what they say is the next big mis-selling scandal.</p> <p>A number of claims management companies are soon to launch websites and TV advertising campaigns targeting borrowers who think they may have been mis-sold mortgages. Most will initially be aimed at customers with interest-only mortgages, even though lenders and the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), which rules on consumer claims against financial companies, say the claims are unlikely to succeed.</p> <p>Interest-only loans are mortgages where the borrower agrees to pay off the interest each month but none of the capital. Borrowers are expected to ensure they have a repayment vehicle in place to pay off the loan once it expires, usually after 25 years.</p> <p>\"A vast number of people who took out interest-only home loans were not subject to adequate checks on the repayment vehicle they have or should have in place,\" says Craig Lowther, managing director of Money Boomerang, a claims management company. \"Many will now be facing massive debts come the end of their mortgage term. We believe many people were mis-sold mortgages and the total value of claims we could be dealing with will be close to that for PPI.\"</p> <p>The mortgages have been embroiled in controversy since it became apparent that large numbers of borrowers have made inadequate or no provision to pay off the capital. Some have blamed banks and building societies for failing to make checks and there was speculation that the Financial Services Authority might ban the loans altogether.</p> <p>However, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/25/fsa-mortgage-review-hard-wire-common-sense-market\" title=\"\">in its long awaited review of the mortgage market published last week</a> the City watchdog stopped short of a ban and instead said that lenders will only be able to grant them if a borrower has a credible repayment plan in place.</p> <p>Nevertheless, some lenders such as Nationwide and Co-op have withdrawn from interest-only lending while others, such as Santander and Lloyds TSB, have tightened the criteria on which they offer interest-only mortgages.</p> <p>Although many claims companies are targeting their marketing around interest-only mortgages to try and cash in on the recent fears surrounding such loans, in reality most of the claims they intend to make will focus on other potential mis-selling <em>(see box, right)</em>.</p> <p>Tim Brookes, who runs <a href=\"http://missoldinterestonly.com/\" title=\"\">missoldinterestonly.com</a> says he has seen his website shoot up in Google's rankings recently as increasing numbers of people search for information on mis-sold loans. His company has not had any successful claims relating solely to the fact that a mortgage is interest-only, but he says he's had some successes with other mortgage claims.</p> <p>\"Self-certification is one area where we have seen customers being badly advised. Lenders and brokers were lazy and told people to take out these loans when they could have got a better loan on the high street,\" he says.</p> <p>Self-certification loans were taken out by self-employed people because the loans enabled them to declare their income without showing substantial proof that they earned it. These loans have now been banned by the FSA.</p> <p>Claims management companies are already fighting among themselves for what they perceive to be future mis-selling business. One representative, who did not wish to be named, says his company will be launching a \"major initiative\" around mis-sold mortgages at the end of next month. He says the claims management sector is \"currently a mess\" and that there are lots of companies about to jump on the \"mortgage mis-selling bandwagon\" who have no idea what they are doing.</p> <p>\"There is a perception among some in the industry that everyone can claim and throw mud at the wall and something will stick \u2013 and that is wrong,\" he says. \"Unless you can demonstrate that the individual you are representing has suffered a tangible loss there is no claim.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the FOS agrees: \"It sounds like claims management companies are going for the scattergun approach. If they apply that blanket approach, it is not going to work.\"</p> <p>The claims companies <em>The Observer</em> has spoken to say they expect to bring claims against both brokers and lenders, though it seems likely most will be against brokers, many who have now been shut down by the FSA or ceased trading. Any claims rejected by lenders will end up with the FOS, say the claims management companies, while those against brokers who have gone out of business will be referred to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. \"Although we expect a lot of claims to be against brokers, lenders will be vulnerable where they had in-house advisers who were pushing interest-only loans where these were not suitable or where they had not made sufficient checks on the repayment vehicle,\" says Lowther.</p> <p>If a claim is successful, Lowther says he would expect to be able to claim back all the payments the borrower would have made towards his loan had that loan been taken on a repayment basis, plus an additional 8% interest.</p> <p>The FOS says this is unlikely. \"It just doesn't follow that if you were successful you would get all your mortgage payments back,\" says a spokesman. \"We would also look at the responsibility of the borrower to check the details of their own mortgage in each case and any redress would reflect that.\"</p> <p>Claims management companies typically had steep charges. Money Boomerang will take 25% of any successful claim, while mis-soldinterestonly charges a non-refundable \u00a3395 plus VAT upfront and then takes a 25% cut. A spokeswoman for the Council of Mortgage Lenders says: \"We strongly believe that the overwhelming majority of mortgages have been sold and administered in line with [FSA] standards. If a borrower believes they have a legitimate reason to think that the standards were not met, then we would urge them to follow up their concern with the broker or lender who sold them their mortgage. If they remain dissatisfied, the Financial Ombudsman Scheme can decide whether there is a case to answer.\"</p>",

  "<p>Amid warnings that land deals are undermining food security, the head of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has compared \"land grabs\" in Africa to the \"wild west\", saying a \"sheriff\" is needed to restore the rule of law.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Graziano da Silva, the FAO's director general, conceded it was not possible to stop large investors buying land, but said deals in poor countries needed to be brought under control.</p> <p>\"I don't see that it's possible to stop it. They are private investors,\" said Graziano da Silva in a telephone interview. \"We do not have the tools and instruments to stop big companies buying land. Land acquisitions are a reality. We can't wish them away, but we have to find a proper way of limiting them. It appears to be like the wild west and we need a sheriff and law in place.\"</p> <p>Large land deals have accelerated since the surge in food prices in 2007-08, prompting companies and sovereign wealth funds to take steps to guarantee food supplies. But, four to five years on, in Africa only 10-15% of land is actually being developed, claimed Graziano da Silva. Some of these investments have involved the loss of jobs, as labour intensive farming is replaced by mechanised farming or some degree of loss of tenure rights.</p> <p>Oxfam said the <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org/en/grow/pressroom/pressrelease/2012-10-04/land-sold-last-decade-could-grow-enough-food-feed-billion-people\" title=\"\">global land rush is out of control</a> and urged the World Bank to freeze its investments in large-scale land acquisitions to send a strong signal to global investors to stop.</p> <p>Graziano da Silva, who was in charge of Brazil's widely praised \"zero hunger\" programme, expressed his frustration at the slow pace of creating a global governance structure to deal with land grabs, food security and similar problems. In 2008, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/issues/food/taskforce/\" title=\"\">created a high-level task force on food security</a> on which Graziano Da Silva serves as vice-chairman.</p> <p>In May, the committee on world food security (CFS), a UN-led group that includes governments, business and civil society, laid the groundwork for a governance structure for food by endorsing <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/tenure/voluntary-guidelines/en/\" title=\"\">voluntary guidelines on the responsible governance of tenure of land, fisheries and forests</a>.</p> <p>Tenure has important implications for development, as it is difficult for poor and vulnerable people to overcome hunger and poverty when they have limited and insecure rights to land and other natural resources. But the guidelines took years to negotiate and lack an effective enforcement mechanism because they are voluntary. The CFS is an unwieldy group but has the virtue of inclusivity.</p> <p>\"It took two years to discuss the voluntary guidelines and now we face another two years of negotiations on the principles for responsible agricultural investments,\" said Graziano da Silva. \"We need to speed up the decison-making process without losing the inclusivity model.\"</p> <p>The FAO director general said he is doing his best to bring about more co-ordination among the different institutions concerned with food security and suggests the FAO act like an executive arm of the CFS, trying to implement its decisions.</p> <p>Others share his frustrations. Olivier De Schutter, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, acknowledges the importance of the CFS voluntary guidelines, but points out the lack of an effective enforcement mechanism. He argues <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/mar/02/african-governments-land-deals\" title=\"\">that governments in sub-Sahran Africa or south-east Asia with poor governance, or tainted by corruption, will continue to seek to attract investors at all costs</a>.</p> <p>\"The international community should accept it has a role in monitoring whether the rights of land users, as stipulated in the guidelines, are effectively respected,\" De Schutter told the Guardian. \"Since there is no 'sheriff' at global level to achieve this, at the very least, the home states of investors should exercise due diligence in ensuring that private investors over which they can exercise control fully respect the rights of land users. Export credit agencies, for example, should make their support conditional upon full compliance with the guidelines, and in the future, the rights of investors under investment treaties should be made conditional upon the investors acting in accordance with the guidelines.\"</p> <p>For Graziano da Silva, the key is the implementation of the voluntary guidelines at country level; he is encouraged by growing public interest and awareness of the issue. He points to Uruguay as an example of a government prepared to stand up to international land investors \u2013 \"perhaps the best sheriff\" on land deals.</p> <p>\"They have very good laws on land acquisitions,\" he said, but acknowledged that most countries where land grabbing takes place have little consultation with farmer organisations or have weak or repressive governments.</p> <p>As for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/23/talk-point-farming-crossroads-future-agriculture\" title=\"\">the perennial debate</a> on the respective merits of large- and small-scale farming, the FAO boss said Africa had room for both, adding that Brazil had managed it.</p> <p>\"In some areas of Africa \u2013 Mozambique and South Africa \u2013 there is scope for large farms, but this approach is only valid for some grains, where the entire cycle is mechanical,\" he said. \"But this is not suitable for fruits, vegetables or many other local products. Cassava has nothing to do with mechanised agriculture and efficiency does not mean big scale. It's the way you combine crops, the use of water you have available. In Africa today, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2012/oct/12/seed-diversity-food-security-in-pictures\" title=\"\">efficiency means better seeds</a> rather than big tractors. The two models have been there forever in agriculture. Sometimes big-scale will provide exports, but local markets are based on small-scale agriculture.\"</p>",

Keane was moving well to present a target, and Beckham did sort of Beckham-y things - actually doing what he's done a fair amount in the latter part of the year by often choosing the modest option to the team mate in space, rather than the raking crossfield ball.&#xa0;</p> <p>Possession and tempo ebbed and flowed a little.

In fact in the build up to the goal above, there\u2019s some foreshadowing, in the news that first choice keeper Michael Gspurning had picked up a knock that turned out to be significant enough to keep him out for several games and give the Sounders their most indifferent run of the season (they went 3-4-6 in his absence, including a 9 game winless streak).

Santos did for their Champions League ambitions with an emphatic second leg dismantling in Mexico, while Sporting KC stopped them winning their fourth consecutive US Open Cup. They\u2019ve had a solid Champions League campaign again this Fall and are into the quarter finals with minimum fuss, but the pressure to finally deliver an MLS Cup has been compounded by disappointment elsewhere.</p> <p>Eddie Johnson has had a good season in the end, breaking back into the national team and breaking the club season scoring record held by Fredy Montero, but he and Montero have sometimes given the impression of the town not being big enough for the both of them.&#xa0;</p> <p>That said both of them have very happy memories of their games against the Galaxy this season - particularly the remarkable dismantling of LA in Seattle on August 5th.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guDonZBJDgY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/guDonZBJDgY?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-29T00:44:28.173Z\">at 12.44am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-508dd038b5793e5495b451f8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-29T00:39:20.775Z\">12.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">LA Galaxy</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As we mentioned LA know what they need to do to get to MLS Cup and chances are they\u2019ll have to do it very differently than their run to MLS Cup last year, where a single game Western Conference Final and the knowledge that MLS Cup was being held at the Home Depot Center meant that having negotiated New York in the second leg of the Western conference semi-final (don\u2019t ask) the stars were perfectly aligned for the Galaxy to win it in front of their fans, which they duly did. This year though, their woeful start to the season has meant that despite decent form recently, the only way they\u2019re going to be hosting MLS Cup again this year is via a win today (for starters) and Houston Dynamo finding a way past Chicago, Sporting KC and DC or New York, for an unlikely repeat of last year\u2019s final.</p> <p>Stranger things have happened of course, but for that even to be a possibility the Galaxy have to beat the Whitecaps, beat the Earthquakes (with the second leg in San Jose), then beat either Seattle or RSL (again with the second leg on the road). And they have to score against Seattle - which they haven't done in their two meetings this year...</p> <p>Not much home field boost in that mix then - but the Galaxy did get some small encouragement in that area this week, with news that for the Vancouver game at least, an agreement had been reached that an exception could be made to the usually stringent midweek noise regulations that place severe numerical restrictions on crowd attendances at the Home Depot Center. The stadium is in the middle of the Cal State Dominguez Hills campus, and everyone knows students love an early night.</p> <p><strong>First tweet</strong> - and Andy Gillooley fancies the Galaxy's chances, Here's his take on tonight</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AndyGillooley/status/262710116208504832\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-in-reply-to=\"262709623683940352\"><p>@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kidweil\">kidweil</a> @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnussports\">gdnussports</a> Think <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23WhitecapsFC\">#WhitecapsFC</a> might be praying for injuries today.

A win today would take them from 7th overall seed to 3rd - giving them second leg home advantage in their conference semi-final against Real Salt Lake, and perhaps just as importantly, ensuring that should they manage to negotiate their way through the West they would be seeded to host MLS Cup against all but overall number two seed Sporting KC, of the potential Eastern opponents. A draw tonight could leave them with potential final trips to DC or New York, while a loss would mean a potential visit to Chicago. And while we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves with talk of finals, it is relevant that the Sounders are decent on the road, but rather more decent in front of 60,000 plus in Seattle.</p> <p>The Galaxy, meanwhile, know how their path to a repeat MLS Cup starts - with a home wild card game against Vancouver Whitecaps on Thursday night. Interesting to see what selection Bruce Arena goes with tonight, with that game and a possible semi-final first leg a few days later in mind (and Beckham and Donovan needing game time after injuries). Seems like only yesterday we were discussing Arena\u2019s handling of his squad for the three games that made up their opening week. But those games, and the sight of David Beckham wading through ticker tape in Toronto, were actually one long season and a gazillion Chris Wondolowski goals ago.&#xa0;</p> <p>I\u2019ll be back shortly with more build up and team news shortly.

  "<p>Overseas governments have intensified their interest in the tax affairs of foreign nationals based in the UK as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/07/tax-evasion-global-action\" title=\"\">the global crackdown on tax evasion</a> picks up pace.</p> <p>The number of requests for information about taxpayers received by the UK government from overseas tax authorities rose by 18% in the last year, according to law firm Pinsent Masons. Such requests are used to see whether rich individuals are making honest statements to domestic tax authorities about their global assets.</p> <p>HMRC received the most requests for information from Norway, followed by France and Spain.</p> <p>Phil Berwick, director at Pinsent Masons, said: \"The jump in requests shows there are very few places to hide for wealthy individuals who may be trying to avoid tax by moving their assets around the globe. International borders are increasingly meaningless for tax authorities' pursuit of outstanding taxes.</p> <p>\"London attracts ultra-high net worth individuals from a huge range of countries, and the expertise of London in wealth management makes it a stable 'haven' for individuals looking to protect their assets from political or economic instability overseas.\"</p> <p>Tax evasion has become harder to pull off in recent years with international bilateral partnerships. Legislation designed to fight terrorism and money-laundering has also made it easier for countries to share information.</p>"
