  "<p>It could scarcely have had a better marketing campaign than last week's Emmy awards. But having taken four gongs \u2013 including performance honours for its lead actors and the coveted prize for best drama \u2013 the second season of Homeland will also face the highest expectations when it premieres on UK screens this Sunday.</p> <p>This second season opener is almost low-key, marking less the start of a new Homeland adventure, more the next chapter in the one we'd already been following. Its protagonists remain tightly coiled and unpredictable; balanced right on the edge.</p> <p>But viewers don't get the luxury of a gentle run-up as characters are re-established: it's full throttle almost from the very off.</p> <p>When we last saw Sergeant Nicholas Brody, the feted US Marine held captive by al-Qaida for eight years, and Carrie Mathison, the not-so-feted CIA agent convinced of his involvement in an al-Qaida plot, both were close to self-destruction. (Admittedly, one in a more literal way than the other).</p> <p>Both characters' appeal lies in their complexity and indeterminability, and, as the show's trademark strains of jazz fade over the title credits, viewers are reminded why they were so gripped by the pair's faltering dance across the first season.</p> <p>Damian Lewis and Claire Danes are magnetic on screen, and their performances more than stand up to a repeat outing: Brody quietly calculating, Carrie with her emotions writ large. The second series picks up not too far from where we left them: having submitted to electroconvulsive therapy, Carrie is focusing on her mental health; finding peace through routine and gardening. The marine who sent her over the edge, meanwhile, is forging ahead with a political career.</p> <p>The season one finale left some \u2013 including me \u2013 doubting whether Homeland's storyline could believably stretch to further outings, and also left the writers with the problem of their own making: creating a storyline that could feasibly include both characters. The result is unsurprisingly some rather ham-fisted plot-wrangling. Meanwhile, big questions from last series still hang unanswered, while equally large new ones are introduced.</p> <p>The background to this second series is the Israeli bombing of Iranian nuclear plants, with action returning to the Middle East for scenes that underline Homeland's power as a classic spy drama. It could be as much George Smiley disappearing into a doorway as one of the show's more modern operatives. As Saul Berenson (played excellently, once more, by Mandy Patinkin) drops a jaunty hat on to his head and slips into the shadows, there can be few spy-genre fans who don't cheer.</p> <p>But there is also the Brody family to bring into play, and it appears as though Brody's daughter, Dana, may be given a larger role this series. Good news for those who admired Morgan Saylor's performance was as the sulky teen with typically stroppy attitude issues \u2013 she more than deserves the screentime. The danger, of course, is that things become too syrupy.</p> <p>Not that this packed first episode is giving too much away. Fans will find themselves back in that state of Homeland nervous excitement, sitting a bit too upright on the sofa, fingernails in palms. Quite where all the intricately laid layers of plot will lead, will be doubtless the topic of fevered discussion \u2013 but, on past form, few correct predictions.</p> <p><em>Homeland starts on Channel 4, Sunday 7 October at 9pm </em></p>",
  "<p>For six months, Paris fashion week had steeled itself for shock and scandal. Ever since Hedi Slimane's appointment to the venerable post of creative director at Yves Saint Laurent back in March, every signal from the house was that Slimane would remake the mythic label in his own image.</p> <p>First came the news that he was moving the design studio from Paris to his preferred home town of Los Angeles; then the announcement that his collections would go under the name Saint Laurent instead of YSL. Not to mention Slimane's track record of discombobulating the fashion world: this, after all, is the designer whose YSL menswear prompted a then seriously overweight Karl Lagerfeld to lose 90lb in a year, so bewitched was he by Slimane's head-turning ultra-skinny take on tailoring.</p> <p>But in front of the chosen few who filled the bleachers of the Grand Palais on Monday evening, Slimane delivered the one thing no one expected: a reverential, nostalgic homage to 1960s and 1970s Yves Saint Laurent. In retrospect, this was surely always what Slimane planned: when chastised by critics for the name change, he insisted that this was no ego trip but merely a wish to reset the YSL clock to its revolutionary early days.</p> <p>The dial was set firmly to the 1970s. The wide-brimmed hats recalled those worn by Bianca Jagger on her wedding day in 1971; the fulsome sleeves of the blouses the YSL \"peasant\" collections of the mid 1970s.</p> <p>There were plenty of modern references in there too: the stage wear of Florence Welch, the sky-blue vintage dress worn by Kate Moss at her wedding rehearsal dinner, the luxe-groupie chic which informs backstage aesthetics to this day.</p> <p>But where this collection felt lacking was in relevance to the real world of what is worn on the streets of Paris and London. Most women will never wear the clothes on the Paris catwalks \u2013 but if a label is to have potency in the modern world they need to feel that this is what they would wear in an ideal world, not an olden-day one. Unmodified nostalgia does not have the same punch.</p> <p>This Paris fashion week has been dominated by the face-off between YSL and Dior, whose new designer Raf Simons presented his first ready to wear collection three days ago,.</p> <p>The anticipation was heightened by invitations in the form of notebooks embossed with the date and venue of the show on the front cover, filled with blank pages with a monochrome leopardprint background; and by the simple show notes left on each seat, which declared simply: \"Collection I\". Slimane's debut drew a heavyweight audience, including Azzedine Alaia, Diane Von Furstenberg, Vivienne Westwood and Peter Dundas.</p> <p>The audience were guided into a dark black tent buried deep in the Grand Palais and, 27 minutes after the appointed start time, darkness turned to pitch black and the flat black panels of the roof tilted on their hinges to form a shape akin to a church; speakers descended, and the music began to throb.</p> <p>It was a moment which blended the spiritual and the Star Wars to spinetingling effect: even Anna Wintour was noted to smile. Roving spotlights turned to strobe lighting, and then segued to a peaceful twilight as the first outfits emerge.</p> <p>It was an undoubtedly assured womenswear debut from a designer making his first foray beyond menswear. Every flowing dress and sheer cape was immaculately cut. But the show left viewers with a hankering for more of the Slimane-stamped skinny tailoring which dominated the first few exits, and fewer of the dress-and-cape outfits.</p> <p>An industry who arrived at this show preparing to be scandalised at how Slimane ignored the YSL heritage left wishing he had imposed himself just a little more. But this is, as Slimane made clear, only Collection I. And Kate Moss, backstage, pronounced it \"gorge\".</p>",
  "<p>After watching <a href=\"http://www.climatecrisis.net/an_inconvenient_truth/about_the_film.php\" title=\"\">An Inconvenient Truth</a>, Al Gore's documentary on the threat of global warming, Adrian Tuck's wife asked him, \"What are we doing about this?\" Tuck, CEO at Tendril, realised he didn't have a good answer. He started to look at his own energy consumption and found it was challenging to get detailed, useable information from the local utility company other than a billing statement in his mailbox once a month. </p> <p>\"I realised there was an opportunity to have a massive impact on energy efficiency just by educating people and giving them insight, choice and control of their energy use in ways that weren't available at the time,\" Tuck says.</p> <p>This realisation became the basis for Tendril Connect, a software platform that the company has now sold to some 40 energy utility companies. According to Tuck, the Tendril Connect platform is now crunching nearly five terabytes of big data each month for these companies related to the energy use of their residential customers, local weather patterns, demographic and behavioral information. </p> <p>Analysing all this data, the platform enables energy utilities to provide their residential customers with personalised energy reports, conservation tips, and even automation of home appliances to reduce consumption.</p> <p>Energy savings vary depending on the customers' level of engagement. They can choose to receive reports, either by mail or email, showing their consumption patterns and offering energy-saving advice. The annual energy savings for customers who receive these reports is between one to three percent, according to Tendril's estimates.</p> <p>An online web portal and mobile app goes beyond paper reports to offer energy saving games, challenges and social media interaction with other like-minded customers. Savings from the online tools range from four to seven percent annually. </p> <p>Energy providers can offer their customers Tendril's home control devices like smart thermostats and smart outlet plugs. These smart devices automate the process of turning the temperature up/down or turning major appliances on/off based on rules set by the customer. Annual savings are in the eight to 10 percent range, estimates Tendril.</p> <p>Tendril's products are also helping energy providers facilitate load control and demand response programs. These allow the utility to directly control appliances and heating and cooling systems in the customer's home during times of peak demand. Energy savings from these programs range from 15 to 25 percent. </p> <p>Almost all of this work is with US-based energy companies, although Tendril now supports a large project in Australia and another in the Netherlands. The company is working to secure future business in Japan, Germany, China and India \u2013 all countries where energy efficiency has become a priority, notes Tuck. </p> <p>Homes consume about a third of the electricity generated each year in the US, and many utilities are facing mandates from regulators to reduce this amount. So it's no surprise that the market for home energy management products is growing and expected to reach $2bn by 2020, according to estimates from <a href=\"http://www.pikeresearch.com/\" title=\"\">Pike Research</a>.</p> <p>But it's also a crowded sector, with hundreds of companies now selling products and services either to energy utilities or directly to consumers. </p> <p>Tuck believes Tendril's emphasis on developing products to open industry standards will set it apart. Rather than trying to build everything in-house, this year the company opened its platform to outside developers and launched an application marketplace. More than 400 developers have already signed on, says Tuck, building everything from energy saving games to apps that control your home appliances.</p> <p><strong>The 2012 Global Cleantech 100 was created by the <a href=\"http://www.cleantech.com/\">Cleantech Group</a>.

  "<p>European harmony may have been thrillingly evident at the Ryder Cup but it was in much shorter supply at the UK launch of this season's Heineken Cup in west London. Even the venue, Sky's headquarters in Isleworth, felt like a pointed rebuke to the English clubs following their controversial broadcasting deal with BT Vision and the rival factions continue to differ sharply over the future of the tournament.</p> <p>There was one particularly telling snapshot when Glasgow's head coach, Gregor Townsend, and Northampton's director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, were both asked how they viewed the possibility of a 20-team tournament with no guaranteed entry for clubs from all six leading nations, with qualification hinging entirely on a merit-based top-six finish in the Aviva Premiership, the RaboDirect Pro12 or the French Top 14 respectively.</p> <p>Townsend, once of Northampton himself, responded with an eloquent defence of the current 24-team system, having also had experience of Super Rugby in the southern hemisphere. \"I've played in both and the Heineken Cup is the best in the world. Part of its appeal is the involvement of so many countries.\" Mallinder, sitting to his right, politely demurred. \"What we want is the best teams in Europe playing together,\" he retorted. From where he sits the ability of the Irish provinces, in particular, to rest key players at certain points of the season tilts the playing field significantly.</p> <p>And so it went on. Townsend followed up with another deft backhand. \"Players get rested more in the Celtic countries because we've got more national squad players. As Jim knows you can't play your international players throughout the whole season.\" A few moments later it was the turn of Leicester's Richard Cockerill to smash that argument back over the net.</p> <p>\"It's very hard to be ultra-competitive at Premiership and European level under the current constraints. You go in trying to be as good as you can be but that's reliant on how fit your best players are. How many top-end players do we risk at Sale this Friday if we want them fresh for Toulouse the following weekend?\"</p> <p>The debate will rumble on beyond next week's ERC meeting of the various interested parties in Rome. Derek McGrath, ERC's chief executive, remains adamant that Premiership Rugby Limited, which represents the English clubs, has lost sight of the Heineken Cup's magic ingredient. \"The growth of the tournament has not been accidental. It's now owned by a lot more stakeholders than are sitting around our table.Balanced co-existence is one of the cornerstones of why the tournament's been successful. That's why we reject any deal that's not done from the central point of view.\"</p> <p>McGrath also questions PRL's freedom to do its own broadcasting deal, even though the English clubs have served notice of their intention to quit the existing agreement from 2014. While he awaits the small print of the BT deal, furthermore, he is convinced the French federation and the Top 14 clubs will stay in the fold. \"In France they will not get approval to do such a deal,\" he said, describing an English withdrawal as \"almost unthinkable\". \"There's too much at stake to expect we're not going to have difficulties in getting 10 different parties to agree. But ultimately people have to make their own decisions. Do we want to be involved or not?\"</p> <p>On that score there is general agreement. When this year's tournament kicks off next week, England's champions, Harlequins, will be striving as hard as anyone to conquer Europe's summit. Their Irish director of rugby, Conor O'Shea, is convinced a political ceasefire will materialise: \"My heart doesn't sink because I feel it's going to be sorted. Everyone wants to play in the European Cup: players, coaches, supporters and the media all want to see the best teams playing in the best competition. We know that peace will break out.\"</p> <h2>Euro Smash<br></h2> <p>Talking of Europe, the sight of Germany's Martin Kaymer being engulfed by his team-mates caused one or two British and Irish Lions supporters to wonder if rugby's traditional arrangement might one day be worth extending. The Ryder Cup, of course, used to be an exclusively UK and Ireland production before Seve Ballesteros and Co transformed the landscape. Financial and historical factors make it highly unlikely the four home unions would ever throw open their doors but how about an 'all-star' game once every four years against the best of the rest of Europe?</p> <p>The latter squad would have a strong French flavour, naturally, but here's a possible pan-European XV (including a Dutchman on loan from Scotland) to ponder. Check out the pack, in particular. And remember where you heard the idea first...!</p> <p>Euro XV: Cl\u00e9ment Poitrenaud (France); Tim Visser (Holland/Scotland) or Vasily Artemyev (Russia), Aur\u00e9lien Rougerie (France), Wesley Fofana (France), Vincent Clerc (France); Fran\u00e7ois Trinh-Duc (France), Dimitri Yachvili (France); Davit Zirakashvili (Georgia), Marius Tincu (Romania), Martin Castrogiovanni (Italy), Pascal Pape (France), Yoann Maestri (Toulouse), Thierry Dusautoir (France, capt), Mamuka Gorgodze (Georgia), Sergio Parisse (Italy).</p> <h2>Hold on tight this weekend for...<br></h2> <p>Leinster v Munster. The Heineken Cup is looming so this is the moment for the leading Irish sides to crank up the volume. Leinster lost heavily to Connacht last weekend and will be looking to resume normal service. Munster, who went down to the Ospreys, have a bit to prove as well, particularly with Ulster going well.</p>",
  "<p>The chief executive of EADS, Tom Enders, has dismissed fears that the European aerospace group's proposed \u20ac34bn merger with UK arms manufacturer BAE Systems will lead to widespread redundancies in the UK, saying that cutting thousands of jobs is \"not the purpose\" of the deal.</p> <p>Enders said the combination of Britain's largest defence contractor with the owner of Airbus \u2013 which between them employ more than 50,000 in the UK \u2013 will \"not go down in history as the deal with the most cost synergies.\" The UK government, which could block the deal, is seeking assurances on jobs and Britain's share of manufacturing work under the new company before giving the merger its blessing</p> <p>Speaking at a lecture at the Royal Academy of Engineering in London, Enders said: \"We have faced the same concerns in France, Germany, over here: does it mean are you guys slashing thousands of jobs etc? That's not the purpose.\" Enders added that the deal was about creating growth and would be \"great for Britain.\"</p> <p>Earlier in the day a major shareholder in EADS has had added further complication to the proposed merger by urging the Franco-German industrial group to re-examine the terms of an \"unsatisfactory\" deal.</p> <p>The intervention of Lagard\u00e8re, which owns 7.5% of EADS, added a financial dimension to a transaction that has largely been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/27/proposed-bae-eads-merger-shake-up\" title=\"\">dominated by political concerns</a>. The combination needs the approval of the British, French, German and US governments, the latter being BAE's largest and most politically sensitive customer.</p> <p>Lagard\u00e8re, a conglomerate whose interests span publishing and airport retail, released a statement criticising the terms of the tie-up, in which EADS shareholders will emerge with 60% of the business while BAE stockholders take 40%.</p> <p>Describing the terms of the merger as \"currently unsatisfactory\", a spokesman said: \"Lagard\u00e8re calls on the management of EADS to undertake, without delay, the indispensable re-examination of the project to combine EADS and BAE, to better take into account the interest of all the French controlling shareholders of EADS.\"</p> <p>Lagard\u00e8re's chief executive, Arnaud Lagard\u00e8re, is also the chairman of EADS.</p> <p>There has been speculation that the French government wants to see ownership shared evenly between Paris, London and Berlin, which would leave BAE shareholders with 33% of the dual-listed business. But it is understood that BAE and EADS are not prepared to alter the balance of the new company's ownership.</p> <p>Enders said he was relaxed about Lagard\u00e8re's intervention. \"Shareholders are obviously always potentially concerned. They invest to make money so it's not surprising that some shareholders are concerned about the return they are getting.\"</p> <p>According to reports, Germany and France are preparing to demand direct stakes of 9% in the merged group. Under the current EADS structure Lagard\u00e8re and the French state holding company, Sogepa, own 22.35% of EADS, while Germany's national interest is represented by a 22.35% stake held by carmaker Daimler. The UK government, which has a golden share in BAE that allows it to block a non-UK shareholder taking a significant stake, has voiced concerns over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/bae-merger-eads-uk-hammond\" title=\"\">impact on 52,000 manufacturing jobs in Britain</a> but has signalled that it is broadly in favour of the merger. A source close to the deal said the companies had done \"everything that they need to do\" to meet a 10 October deadline to agree terms, as required by the UK Takeover Panel, but governmental wrangling is now the main issue.</p> <p>Another source said both sides need the UK, German and French governments to reach agreement before anything is put to shareholders: \"Until we have government support or approval for the basic structure, we don't have a deal that we can put to shareholders. Britain's largest trade union, Unite, voiced support for the deal. Ian Waddell, Unite's national officer for aerospace and shipbuilding, said BAE had to reduce its dependence on shrinking US and UK defence budgets. \"I don't see a rosy picture going forward. I see the possibility of terminal, and potentially ignominious decline.\"</p> <p>Ben Wallace, the Conservative MP whose Lancashire constituency includes the BAE aircraft manufacturing site at Warton, Lancashire, said: \"The question nobody seems to know the answer to is, how does this help the company commercially? I can see how it benefits EADS, because it wants to divest itself of the control of the French and German governments. But I do not see how this benefits BAE.\"</p> <p>BAE and EADS declined to comment. However, the companies' chief executives made a renewed declaration of the deal's merits on Monday morning in a joint op-ed piece published in the UK, France and Germany.</p> <p>Ian King, the BAE chief executive, and Enders said: \"With the necessary political will and support, management determination, and proper governance, BAE Systems and EADS can produce a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. Together, we would become a business with a global footprint, and a wider customer base.</p> <p>\"We would be able better to ride the cycles of civil aviation demand and defence spending. And we would be a business with the scale and stability to invest more in R&amp;D, and a force for greater competition and growth.

  "<p>Watching Ed Balls <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/01/ed-balls-uk-infrastructure\" title=\"\">lapping up</a> the limelight on Labour's stage, it was easy to forget how, just two years ago, his leadership bid crashed and burned \u2013 pulling in just <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/votes-by-round\" title=\"\">one vote for every six</a> shared between the Miliband brothers. Back then, as the apparatchik-in-chief of the fallen Brown regime, he was tainted. He still cannot quite shrug off the inheritance, and yet \u2013 by graft and by prescience \u2013 he has certainly made himself count.</p> <p>Everything about <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9578869/In-full-Ed-Ballss-speech-to-Labour-Party-Annual-Conference-2012.html\" title=\"\">speech</a> marked this out as a big moment in Labour's week \u2013 from the<a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/30/balls-labour-windfall-housebuilding-pledge\" title=\"\"> announcement</a> that revenue from 4G spectrum sales would be spent on building homes, to the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/29/ed-balls-labour-lib-dems\" title=\"\"> noises-off in the Sunday papers </a>from hostile Lib Dems. They mutter that they could never work with a shadow chancellor who today appears a solid feature of the landscape, but who not so long ago was passed over, when Ed Miliband instead appointed <a href=\" http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11499638\" title=\"\">Alan Johnson</a> to the job. Mr Balls got there in the end not just through ambition, but also courage. The government's plan to cut first and think about growth only second was implicitly accepted by much of the establishment, within the Labour party and beyond. Mr Balls was brave to warn that this would usher in the present double dip. Being proved right has cemented him in post, and he could hardly conceal his enjoyment as he effectively said \"I told you so\" from the stage; his pledge to replace mere words about recovery with real new homes was chosen to underline the point.</p> <p>The former backroom boy is no natural orator, yet he looked easier at the podium than before. His theme \u2013 a ringing defence of social democracy \u2013 was hardly a difficult sell to the Labour tribe, but he deftly used the goodwill achieved by invoking Bevan and Beveridge to persuade the hall to swallow a few harsh realities. Even after Britain wriggles free of self-defeating deficit targets, and George Osborne himself is gearing up to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/11/treasury-prepares-abandon-fiscal-target\" title=\"\">jettison one</a> , the country is \u2013 and will remain \u2013 poorer than it believed it was during the boom. Mr Balls's emphasis on infrastructure might lighten distant dark horizons, providing he can find a way to raise the funds without investors taking fright. But even wise investments take time to pay returns. The next few years will bring more painful fiscal choices, whoever is in charge.</p> <p>All this, then, was well judged. And yet a decent speech failed to become something better because of two connected omissions. The first was an apology. Not the apology about social expenditure which the right in the country and the Labour party demand, but rather an apology about hugging the City too close. Mr Balls could and should confess that the political need for Labour's prawn cocktail offensive during the 1990s blinded him and his erstwhile boss to the economic wisdom of keeping their distance from the money men. For good measure, he could have added that the Conservatives were then even more in hock to the disgraced financiers. Instead, however, he proudly cited Bank of England independence as a great New Labour triumph, even though this was one plank of a governance regime which proved to be part of the problem.</p> <p>Such an apology is a precondition to correcting the second omission \u2013 the agenda that Ed Miliband labels responsible capitalism. Mr Balls devoted precisely one line to industrial policy, and even this shunted the issue towards his colleague Chuka Umunna. There was no word on using company law to change the culture, or bring cowboy profiteers to heel. He dutifully repeated Mr Miliband's weekend words on the banks, but by signalling that the state's stake in them would be flogged off for a fast buck, he closed off more creative options. Mr Balls is proving an able tactician as shadow chancellor, but to prove his worth as a strategist he needs to swing behind Mr Miliband's stated desire to rebuild the economy on fairer foundations. Only with both Eds on the job can the party hope to translate that airy talk of a better tomorrow into gritty manifesto proposals.</p>",
  "<p>Negotiations aimed at unlocking fresh rescue funds for Greece appeared to have hit deadlock on Monday after international lenders rejected \u20ac2bn in spending cuts proposed by the debt-stricken country.</p> <p>Representatives of the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2013 the \"troika\" of creditors keeping Greece's insolvent economy afloat \u2013 flatly rejected key cost-cutting measures in a \u20ac13.5bn austerity package lenders are demanding in return for further aid.</p> <p>After haggling over the cuts for most of its short period in office, Athens' fractious coalition was told the measures were \"unworkable\". The country remains mired in what will soon be a sixth year of recession.</p> <p>\"They have asked for clarifications and the talks are continuing,\" said the Greek finance minister, Yiannis Stournaras, looking down-beat as he emerged from a meeting with the officials.</p> <p>Insiders said the lenders had objected to proposed cuts to the operational budgets of ministries as well as plans to lay off an estimated 15,000 civil servants by 2014. Instead, the visiting inspectors insisted the ruling coalition agree to further cuts in wages and pensions, a potentially explosive demand that Stournaras has repeatedly said will lead to the collapse of the Greek government.</p> <p>The prime minister, Antonis Samaras, made a series of appeals to his EU counterparts.</p> <p>Speculation of a growing rift among creditors over how to handle the \"Greek problem\" added to the fraught mood. With a vital \u20ac31.5bn cash instalment dependent on the austerity package finally being agreed, officials in Athens voiced fears of an \"unforeseen accident\" because of differences between the EU and IMF.</p> <p>Last week the IMF chief, Christine Lagarde, said Greece's debt problem \"will have to be addressed\" in what was widely interpreted as renewed pressure to restructure its debt mountain. Lagarde was voicing the widely-held belief that six months after a huge writedown of Greek bonds by the private sector, Athens' debt pile remains unsustainable and can only be brought under control \u2013 and meet the targeted goal of reaching 120% of GDP by 2020 \u2013 if it is also restructured by the public sector.</p> <p>But with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, already hitting the campaign trail ahead of general elections next year, few in Berlin appear willing to accept further losses to salvage the Greek economy. \"I think it would be fair to say [the differences] are affecting the talks,\" said one Greek official. \"We are not just dealing with differences amongst ourselves [the three parties supporting Greece's governing coalition] but within the troika.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, unemployment in the eurozone hit a record 18.2 million, according to EU figures. The jobless rate across the euro area was 11.4% in August. July's reading was also been revised up to 11.4% from 11.3% previously. In the EU as a whole the jobless rate was 10.5%, with 25.4 million out of work. Youth unemployment is particularly bleak, at 22.8% in the eurozone, and 22.7% across the EU.

  "<h2><strong>Tramm Wigzell, co-developer</strong></h2> <p>You hear so many pitches in this business and there's almost always something wrong with them: the team are great, but the idea's not quite right; or the idea's good, but you're not sure the team can pull it off. But when TV production house <a href=\"http://www.manofaction.tv/about.html\" title=\"\">Man of Action</a> \u2013 a bunch of real industry veterans \u2013 pitched Ben 10, we knew pretty much straightaway that this was a show we wanted to do.</p> <p>It's partly the simplicity: there's this kid who has an \"omnitrix\" on his wrist that means he can turn himself into 10 different types of alien and save the world. But alongside that, there's his personality: full of bravado, full of himself, so you get comedy in among the action, too. Know what I thought?&#xa0;I&#xa0;thought: \"This is the summer blockbuster that I wanted to see when I was nine but I never did.\"</p> <p>We got quite a bit of negative feedback during its development. People were asking: \"Does Ben have to be so bratty?\" Or saying: \"Kids don't want to turn into gross aliens. And they won't like it that the omnitrix&#xa0;doesn't always work. They'll want him to be all-powerful.\"</p> <p>But for us, that was what was so great. Kids would tell us: \"Oh yes, that's like my brother, or my friend.\" They said, \"If I could do all that, that's what I'd be like.\" And it was the same thing with the omnitrix. We thought: \"As kids, if we ever got a new video game or a gadget, we would never read the instruction book. We would just put it on and start trying to figure out how it works.\" That's just what Ben does. It's what guys do anywhere, so it's easy to relate to.</p> <p>When we launched it, we had a strong feeling it was going to do well, but you never know. And then \u2013 slowly&#xa0;but surely \u2013 it started to grow. The ratings were good, but the thing that really struck us was when we'd be out and see a kid with an omnitrix on his wrist. And then someone forwarded me <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/1023398/Kids-TV-show-Ben-Gordon-Brown-Cant-stop-humming-theme-tune.html\" title=\"\">an article that quoted Gordon Brown saying he couldn't get the theme tune out of his head</a>. The prime minister? From Britain? Is this a&#xa0;joke?</p> <h2><strong>Matt Youngberg, director and producer</strong></h2> <p>The last series of Ben 10 was darker than the earlier stuff. Ben was older, and a lot of it took place at night. So when I took over, I wanted to get back to the heart of it: a kid having adventures, finding his way, not knowing what he's doing but having a ton of fun doing it. He's a kid, he's being a hero, and there's no dark side. It's less fun to me to do a story about someone who's all cramped up about the trauma of being a superhero: I just don't know if I'd feel that way about it. There are a whole lot of things out there getting darker; I guess this is my reaction to that.</p> <p>The great thing about sci-fi and aliens is that there are just so many things you can do. Since it's aliens, you don't have to worry much about being too realistic. You can make them crazy purples and pinks. So my Ben 10 is really bright: the colours are practically bleeding out of the television.</p> <p>As a kid, I was always into cartoons and comic books: GI Joe, Transformers, that kind of thing. Even before I started on Ben 10, I used to fantasise about what I would do if I ever got into that playground. It's a great job: I go in to work and draw aliens shooting laser beams at each other.\u2022 Ben 10: Omniverse is on the Cartoon Network from 6 October.</p>",
  "<p>A genetically modified cow whose milk lacks a substance that causes allergic reactions in people has been created by scientists in New Zealand.</p> <p>In their first year of life, two or three in every hundred infants are allergic to a whey protein in milk called BLG. The researchers engineered the cow, called Daisy, to produce milk that doesn't contain the protein.</p> <p>While the genetic alteration slashed levels of BLG protein in the cow's milk to undetectable levels, it more than doubled the concentrations of other milk proteins called caseins.</p> <p>The cow was created with the same cloning procedure that led to Dolly the sheep in 1996 and was delivered by caesarean at the government-owned <a href=\"http://www.agresearch.co.nz/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"AgResearch\">AgResearch</a> lab in Hamilton.</p> <p>Most of the differences between cow and human milk do not cause problems for people who consume it, but BLG or beta-lactoglobulin protein, which is found in milk from cows and other ruminants, is a major cause of allergic reactions.</p> <p>Stefan Wagner, a scientist on the team, said they now plan to investigate whether or not the BLG-free milk causes allergic reactions.</p> <p>\"First of all, we will have to determine whether the lack of detectable levels of BLG will impact on milk yield,\" said Wagner.</p> <p>The work also drew on a technique that gives scientists precise control over which genes are active in an animal, and gives fresh momentum to plans to engineer cows, pigs, sheep and chickens that are more resilient to diseases.</p> <p>To make Daisy, scientists took a cow skin cell and genetically modified it to produce molecules that block the manufacture of BLG protein. The nucleus of this cell was then transferred into a cow egg that had its own nucleus removed.</p> <p>The reconstituted egg was grown in the lab until it formed what is called a blastocyst, a ball of around 100 cells, and then transplanted into the womb of a foster cow.</p> <p>The cloning technique is not efficient. Of around 100 blastocysts the scientists implanted into cows, more than half of the pregnancies failed early on, and only one live calf, Daisy, was born.</p> <p>Details of the experiments are published in a report in <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1210057109\" title=\"Targeted microRNA expression in dairy cattle directs  production of -lactoglobulin-free, high-casein milk \">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.roslin.ed.ac.uk/bruce-whitelaw/\" title=\"Bruce Whitelaw\">Bruce Whitelaw</a>, professor of animal biotechnology at the Roslin Institute at Edinburgh University, said the major advance was demonstrating that the genetic procedure, called RNA interference, works in large animals. Other groups have \"humanised\" cow's milk by adding genes or removing those that can cause allergic reactions.</p> <p>\"Many people have been talking about using this technique to better arm an animal to combat a virus infection, and this adds momentum to that work,\" Whitelaw said. His own lab is looking at how cows, pigs, sheep and chickens might be modified to carry genes that fight infections. Last year, the Roslin Institute used a related technique to create chickens that <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6014/223.short\" title=\"Suppression of Avian Influenza Transmission in Genetically Modified Chickens\">cannot spread avian flu</a>.</p> <p>One question the New Zealand team is working on now is why Daisy was born without a tail. The cloning process is most likely to blame for the birth defect, rather than the extra genes she carried. \"This congenital abnormality is rare in cows and not something we have seen in animals we have cloned previously,\" said Wagner. The lab hopes to breed from Daisy in the future.</p> <p>Under European law, food products - including milk - from cloned animals, must be assessed for safety and approved for sale before they can be marketed.</p> <p>\"We first of all consider our genetically modified cow a great tool to study allergenicity and do not envision any practical application any time soon,\" Wagner added.</p>",

They are under threat around the world from the effects of bleaching, due to rising ocean temperatures, and increasing acidification of the oceans, which reduces the corals' ability to build their calcium carbonate structures.</p> <p>The Great Barrier Reef is the most iconic coral reef in the world, listed as a Unesco world heritage site and the source of $A5bn (\u00a33.2bn) a year to the Australian economy through tourism. The observations of its decline are based on more than 2,000 surveys of 214 reefs between 1985 and 2012. The results showed a decline in coral cover from 28% to 13.8% \u2013 an average of 0.53% a year and a total loss of 50.7% over the 27-year period. The study was published on Monday in the <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1208909109\" title=\"\">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal (subscription)</a>.</p> <p>Two-thirds of the coral loss has occurred since 1998 and the rate of decline has increased in recent years, averaging around 1.45% a year since 2006. \"If the trend continued, coral cover could halve again by 2022,\" said Peter Doherty, a research fellow at the institute.</p> <p>Tropical cyclones, predation by Cots, and bleaching accounted for 48%, 42%,and 10% of the respective estimated losses. In the past seven years the reef has been affected by six major cyclones. Cyclone Hamish, for example, ran along the reef, parallel to the coast for almost 930 miles (1,500km), leaving a trail of destruction much greater than the average cyclone, which usually crosses the reef on a path perpendicular to the coast.</p> <p>The starfish problem was first recorded in 1962 at Green Island off Cairns. \"When we say outbreaks, we mean explosions of Cots populations to a level where the numbers are so large that they end up eating upwards of 90% of a reef's coral,\" Gunn said. \"Since 1962 there have been major outbreaks every 13-14 years.\"</p> <p>The evidence suggests that outbreaks of Cots start two or three years after major floods in northern rivers.</p> <p>In September, scientists at the International Union for Conservation of Nature announced that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/10/caribbean-coral-reefs-collapse-environment\" title=\"\">Caribbean coral reefs are on the verge of collapse</a>, with less than 10% of the reef area showing live coral cover. The collapse was due to environmental issues, including over-exploitation, pollution and climate change.</p> <p>David Curnick, marine and freshwater programme co-ordinator at the Zoological Society of London, said many of the <a href=\"http://www.edgeofexistence.org/coral_reef/default.php\" title=\"\">most endangered coral species around the world</a> were also under severe pressure from the aquarium trade.</p> <p>\"Corals are notoriously hard to propagate in captivity and therefore the trade is still heavily dependent on harvesting from the wild.\".\"</p> <p>He said the results of the Great Barrier Reef survey were not surprising and the challenge for conservationists was to limit the localised threats to give reefs a chance to recover and develop resilience against the effects of climate change. \"This is challenging but entirely achievable and there are many community-led projects around the world demonstrating this.\"</p> <p>Corals can recover if given the chance. But this is slow \u2013 in the absence of cyclones, Cots and bleaching, the Great Barrier Reef can regrow at a rate of 2.85% a year, the scientists wrote. Removing the Cots problem alone would allow coral cover to increase at 0.89% a year.</p> <p>Reducing Cots means improving water quality around the rivers at the northern end of the reef to reduce agricultural run-off \u2013 high levels of nutrients flowing off the land feed and allow high survival of Cots larvae. Another option is some form of biological control of populations \u2013 Gunn said there were promising results from research on naturally occurring pathogens that could keep Cots in check, but it was not ready to be applied in the field.</p> <p>He said the future of the Reef lay partly in human hands. \"We can achieve better water quality, we can tackle the challenge of crown-of-thorns, and we can continue to work to ensure the resilience of the reef to climate change is enhanced. However, its future also lies with the global response to reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The coral decline revealed by this study \u2013 shocking as it is \u2013 has happened before the most severe impacts of ocean warming and acidification associated with climate change have kicked in, so we undoubtedly have more challenges ahead.\"</p>",
  "<p>On the face of it, private providers of higher education have never had it so good. Long regarded as a threat by many in the sector, they have been warmly welcomed by the coalition government. And business is booming. Yet senior figures in the private sector are getting anxious. They say they are still wrestling with a system that was not set up to accommodate them, and until changes are embedded by legislation, they face an uncertain future.</p> <p>Private providers say there was considerable opposition from the last administration, with civil servants frequently barring their way with new pieces of inexplicable bureaucracy. The coalition has made no bones about its willingness to embrace private provision.</p> <p>For the first time this autumn, undergraduates studying a higher education course run by a private provider can access public loans of \u00a36,000 a year to finance their degree. This falls short of the \u00a39,000 available to students of other universities, but many providers say their overheads are sufficiently low that this price cap doesn't bother them.</p> <p>While many public universities spent the summer fretting about exceeding student number limits in popular subjects and incurring fines, private institutions were free to recruit whoever they wanted.</p> <p>Alan Jenkins, principal of private giant Kaplan's newest HE partnership, the Edge Hotel School, says: \"There is certainly a lack of hostility to private providers now, which is a real improvement.\" However, he says: \"It's not necessarily policy that holds us back, but implementing new models, such as changing the degree calendar, within the old system is harder than it should be.\"</p> <p>Though private provision is still a tiny proportion of the whole sector, interest from students is soaring. Total applications to the University of Buckingham were up nearly 90% this year, notwithstanding its \u00a39,000 fees. Meanwhile, for-profit BPP University College had a hefty 125% increase, and the private ifs School of Finance was up nearly 113%. This is striking at a time when applications across the sector as a whole have declined.</p> <p>Prof Terence Kealey, vice-chancellor of Buckingham, says that the feeling of otherness he had experienced since taking over the private institution has \"evaporated\". But he says many of his counterparts in the public sector don't share his excitement. \"I was at a forum with a large number of vice-chancellors and they were all moaning about how unfair it all was, saying it wasn't a level playing field.\"</p> <p>But while some in the public sector are smarting about the freedoms given to their new bedfellows, private providers fear insecurity. There is no doubt that this is a political hot potato. Legislation to embed the new changes formed part of the planned higher education bill, but this was shelved by the government earlier this year following concerns in No 10.</p> <p>Paul Marshall, chief executive of the Association of Business Schools, explains: \"Private providers benefit from being outside the system and right now they can expand provision massively, but what happens if Labour comes in and stops all this? The risk is very high for investors.\"</p> <p>One major area of uncertainty is student numbers. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has made it clear that the number of loans available to students at private institutions will not remain uncapped, and it is consulting on how to achieve this.</p> <p>Carl Lygo, chief executive of BPP, sees this change as inevitable. \"In this environment, where student numbers are falling and university leaders are panicking, if the public universities can use an opportunity to get the government to protect them they will,\" he says. Yet he is \"relaxed\" about the idea of bidding for numbers from a general pot, confident that BPP can demonstrate value for money and quality.</p> <p>Gavin Shreeve, principal at the ifs School, believes the coalition is siding with the public sector: \"The numbers involved in private higher education are minute compared to numbers elsewhere, so this is entirely political,\" he says.</p> <p>Lygo points out that long-term planning on the domestic undergraduate market is all but impossible until the loan capping issue is resolved. \"Where the government will have difficulty is how do you encourage new providers to come into such a controlled environment?\" he says.</p> <p>Shreeve's major bugbear, though, is over degree-awarding powers. His institution was given the right to award its own degrees in 2010, following an arduous application process. He is angry that the institution will have to reapply to the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) every six years. \"It is fundamentally unfair,\" he says. \"It was brought in with absolutely no justification, simply as a sop to the HE sector. Why six years? Why not five? Or 10? There is nothing rational about it.\"</p> <p>Kai Peters, chief executive of Ashridge Business School, which won degree-awarding powers in 2008 after years of battling behind the scenes, describes the six-year cycle as \"a Damocles sword hanging over one's head\". He shudders to recall the application process: \"It was awful \u2013 you needed a doctorate in QAA-speak.\"</p> <p>Yet in many ways those with degree-awarding powers are the lucky ones. The London School of Business and Finance has experienced the potential vulnerability of relying on a partnership with an established university. The private institution was initially accredited by the University of Wales, which pulled the plug on its validation business last year, following a series of controversies over its linked colleges. The LSBF signed a new partnership with London Metropolitan University this year \u2013 and that university has now been stripped of its right to recruit international students by the UK Border Agency.</p> <p>Prof James Kirkbride, LSBF's vice-rector, insists that it will be \"standing alongside our strategic partner\", adding that it would offer London Metropolitan's international students the chance to transfer over to LSBF.</p> <p>Kirkbride walked away from a career in public universities when he took over as LSBF's vice-rector two years ago. He says he joined because of the freedom \u2013 but he hasn't found it. \"Frustration has definitely been creeping in,\" he says.</p> <p>Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union, says: \"Private providers, especially for-profit ones, who complain about bureaucracy demonstrate breathtaking gall. Private providers are tapping the taxpayer for off-balance sheet, unregulated, under-scrutinised subsidies. No one knows how many students they recruit or how many complete their degrees.\"</p> <p>Shreeve responds with indignation. \"Mention private higher education and certain people will say quality will be compromised. I say to them you don't understand quality. If you get it wrong, you keep your job, your university doesn't close down, and the taxpayer continues to fund incompetence. I get it wrong and I go out of business.\"</p>",
  "<p>Plans by Reckitt Benckiser to bounce US doctors and drug regulators into migrating addicts on to its patent-protected heroin substitute drug have been called into question after comments from one of the company's independent experts.</p> <p>Reckitt, which is better known for making household goods such as Vanish, Finish, Dettol and Cillit Bang, still generates more than 20% of its operating profit from a legacy pharmaceuticals division which sells opioid dependency treatments \u2013 substantially to Medicaid-funded programmes in America. After 10 years marketing its suboxone pills in the US, the company said last week it had voluntarily decided to withdraw the tablets from the market. <a href=\"http://www.rb.com/site/RKBR/Templates/MediaInvestorsGeneral2.aspx?pageid=1328&amp;cc=GB\" title=\"\">Reckitt told investors</a> it had \"received an analysis of data\" indicating the pills were more likely to be accidentally taken by young children than an alternative version of the product \u2013 an under-the-tongue strip \u2013 also owned by Reckitt.</p> <p>Strip suboxone is protected from competitor products by patent, but the tablet version lost its exclusive marketing rights in the US two years ago. Before the move last week, Reckitt had repeatedly warned investors to expect a fall of up to 80% in sales and profits from the tablets when a generic copycat pill reached the market.</p> <p>Hours after announcing it was to withdraw the tablets, Reckitt revealed it had simultaneously <a href=\"http://www.rb.com/site/RKBR/Templates/MediaInvestorsGeneral2.aspx?pageid=1332&amp;cc=GB\" title=\"\">submitted a so-called \"citizen petition\"</a> to the Food and Drug Administration, urging the US regulator to ban any future competitor pills to its suboxone tablets that were insufficiently \"child resistent\". A company spokesman has insisted commercial motives played no part in Reckitt's decision to withdraw suboxone tablets from the market. However, Martin Deboo, an analyst at Investec Securites said: \"We view these moves as consistent with Reckitt's strategy of protecting the suboxone franchise by hastening migration to [strip] and raising barriers to entry to generics.\"</p> <p>The FDA has so far chosen not to ban the pills. \"We can't comment on this issue as the agency has not yet reviewed the data leading to the sponsor's [Reckitt's] decision,\" a spokeswoman said.</p> <p>Reckitt told the Guardian it had previously urged the FDA to impose such a ban but had been frustrated. \"They were not prepared to accept our assertion that we thought that there was a paediatric exposure benefit of the [strip] without us providing scientific data to prove it.\" Under US law, the regulator is however obliged to review a citizen petition \u2013 though one US healthcare expert said the process often takes years and few such actions started by drug companies have been successful.</p> <p>The Guardian has learned that the data analysis cited last week by Reckitt as the reason for withdrawing the tablets was commissioned by the company itself \u2013 a fact omitted from <a href=\"http://www.rb.com/site/RKBR/Templates/MediaInvestorsGeneral2.aspx?pageid=1328&amp;cc=GB\" title=\"\">its statement</a>.</p> <p>Dr Rick Dart, executive director of Denver-based drug addiction monitoring group Radars, recruited by Reckitt to carry out the study, confirmed that the statement had accurately highlighted a significantly higher incidence of young children accidently exposed to suboxone pills when compared with child exposure rates linked to suboxone strips.</p> <p>He said this appeared to be because each strip dose was packaged individually in a wrapper that was difficult for a child to open, while the pills came loose, in a bottle of 30.</p> <p>Asked if Reckitt might have considered other alternatives than discontinuing the pills, Dart said: \"There are other things they could do, certainly \u2026 They could put it [suboxone] in a blister pack. Every study shows that decreases exposure to small children\".</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Reckitt said: \"We did look at the US suboxone tablets going into the new child-resistent blister packaging technology, but with the formulation of suboxone in the US we have not been able to develop a robust enough solution on which to submit a change. Even if we resolved these technical issues today, we would still have to go through the validation and regulatory registration change approvals process, which could take a minimum of another 9-12 months. \"We were not prepared to wait on something yet unproven to implement the needed safety initiative.\"</p> <p>The group pointed out there had been four child deaths in five years because infants had accidentally managed to get hold of its pills. \"This is not a theoretical risk. It is real.\"</p> <p>The latest official figures show about 2m Americans abused or were dependent on prescription opioid painkillers in 2010, with a further 400,000 people using heroin.</p> <p>Last year, in a saga unrelated to suboxone, Reckitt was fined \u00a310.2m by the Office of Fair Trading in the UK after it was found to have engaged in anti-competitive behaviour following the expiry of a patent on its Gaviscon heartburn treatment. The penalty followed whistleblower revelations which helped prove Reckitt had hoped to prosper by removing Gaviscon Original Liquid from a list of prescription drugs available to NHS patients shortly after the expiry of a patent.</p> <p>This delisting, the OFT concluded, was designed to make it harder for chemists to identify cheaper generic alternatives and to boost sales of Reckitt's new variant Gaviscon Advance Liquid. The Advance Liquid product was in patent and therefore not subject to generic competition.</p> <p>After initial denials, Reckitt did admit abusing its dominant position in the market for heartburn medicines. However it has not settled a parallel \u00a390m civil claim brought by the Department of Health and filed more than 18 months ago.</p> <p>There is no suggestion that moves to withdraw suboxone tablets from the US market risks breaching competition law, in America or elsewhere. \"The RB Gaviscon case is in no way similar to that of suboxone and is irrelevant in this context,\" the company said. \"This [suboxone] issue involves serious child safety risk.\"</p>",
  "<p>There is a hair in my fish pie. \"Are you sure it's not yours?\" says Rachael, my dining companion. But it's not, and it's not one of the cat's either (I'm used to eating food with cat hair in it; it falls off my jumpers). It's baked into the mashed potato, sticking out like a neat little garnish. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother to complain, the idea of making a scene in a restaurant far more offputting to me than a mere stray hair, but the feeling that we're being watched \u2013 the restaurant is rigged with microphones and cameras that swivel towards us \u2013 forces me to confront it. They want me to, don't they?</p> <p>Until the hair incident, we had been enjoying our lunch at Hotel GB in south London, staffed by celebrities for a new Channel 4 show that begins tonight. I can see Gordon Ramsay in the kitchen at the back. The ma\u00eetre d, Phil Spencer from the property show Location, Location, Location, is on the other side of the restaurant taking someone's pudding order. I call him over. \"I don't want Gordon to be angry,\" I tell Spencer, who is already looking pink and flustered, \"but there's a hair in my pie.\"</p> <p>Later, when Ramsay comes over to apologise I tell him I hope nobody gets sacked for it. \"I'm not going to sack anyone because of a pube,\" he says. Actually, I don't think it was a pube. \"Was it curly?\" he demands, like an aggressive detective. Not really \u2013 it wasn't thick either. (How does pubic hair end up in food anyway? Are chefs trouserless behind the pass?) Ramsay, who is wearing trousers, looks a bit happier.</p> <p>I have spent the morning at Hotel GB \u2013 most of it, admittedly, in a bedroom waiting for the production team to finish filming before I'm allowed into parts of the hotel. Ramsay and the retail consultant Mary Portas are its co-general managers, with other famous Channel 4 people taking on tasks: Kim Woodburn is in charge of housekeeping, Gok Wan is working the bar, Katie Piper is the spa manager. They are in charge of 14 trainees \u2013 young unemployed people who have been given this chance to learn how to run a hotel, though quite what they are going to learn from celebrities who also don't know how to run a hotel I'm not sure. One of the trainees has already walked out.</p> <p>At 18, Manisha Sengupta is the youngest trainee and is working in the spa. We chat as she gives my nails a quick file. After finishing a hair-and-beauty course, she had been unemployed for two months when she was spotted by a Channel 4 researcher outside a job centre. \"It's so depressing being out of work. I was looking, looking, looking. I was so happy I got this opportunity. This shows opportunities can come up when you least expect it,\" she says. Is she nervous about being on TV? \"I keep forgetting about the cameras.\"</p> <p>Manisha's manager is Katie Piper, the former model and TV presenter whose efforts to overcome a horrific attack in 2008, in which acid was thrown in her face, has been followed in documentaries. \"It's nice for me to do something more lighthearted, so people can see me in a different way,\" says Piper. \"I like the competitive side as well [divided into men's and women's teams, the celebrities are competing to raise the most money for charity].\" As a teenager, Piper did a hair-and-beauty course at college and worked as an apprentice in a hotel spa, \"so I was in Manisha's position once, and it's lovely to come back and do it again\". She says all this while she washes and massages my feet. It's a faintly uncomfortable experience having someone you admire and respect do this for you (I resolve to leave a large tip).</p> <p>On the way to meet Dr Christian Jessen in the gym, where he will be offering guests \"health MOTs\", I peer through the door of the bar and see Woodburn, hair like an elaborate Christmas cake, cleaning tables. There is no sign of Gok Wan, the barman, or indeed anyone else. Is she being filmed, or does she just do this all the time wherever she goes? Nobody seems to know.</p> <p>Dr Christian is in the gym but not his trainee, Jess, a 20-year-old from Dagenham. \"She hasn't been able to hold down a job \u2013 she has got strong opinions of her own,\" he says. \"I said you've just got to hold down a job for long enough to get some funds in and then you can build up your own business and soon it will take off. She will be at her happiest when she's her own boss.\"</p> <p>I don't know what to ask Dr Christian, he of Embarrassing Bodies fame, being in possession of neither a third nipple nor a mouldy penis, and he only arrived 10 minutes ago and doesn't seem to really know what he's supposed to be doing here either. He says he will do things like measure guests' waists and warn them about cholesterol, and encourage them to do more exercise. He makes me try a hand-held weight, supposedly to firm up triceps, and shows how to move it up and down in a pumping action. I feel myself blushing. \"I call it a wank stick,\" says Dr Christian.</p> <p>I'm still not entirely sure what the point of the show is, beyond the chance to see \u2013 hopefully \u2013 Woodburn or Portas spar with Ramsay or see someone from Towie have a back, sack and crack wax in the salon. It is raising money for youth unemployment charities (the guests who have started checking in around the time I leave are all paying to stay, eat and drink here) and two of the trainees will get paid jobs with Ramsay and Portas at the end of the week, but it's mainly about instilling confidence, says Ramsay, who has three trainees in the kitchen. \"I'm amazed at how many young people are out of work,\" says Ramsay. \"This will give these people whatever it is they need to set them apart.\" If there is a serious point this show has unintentionally highlighted it's the idea that the reason a million 18- to 24-year-olds are unemployed is because of some sort of attitude problem, rather than a complicated mess of global economics and policy failures beyond their control.</p> <p>\"It's easy to be cynical,\" says Portas, who is watching as two of her trainees on reception are checking in an excited family. \"Oh, here we go, another reality show performing as if it's doing something for society. But I do think there is a role for people in the public eye to do more to help empower people and make a change.\" I've been impressed with all the trainees I've met so far and if it helps any of them get a job, then good for them.</p> <p>\"Look at her, isn't she great?\" says Portas, looking at Rory, a 22-year-old with tattoos and piercings who I had decided earlier was the friendliest and most welcoming person I have met in any hotel. Rory visibly swells with pride.</p> <p>\u2022 Hotel GB is on Channel 4 every night at 9pm until Friday</p>",

  "<p>The Northern Ireland assembly has rejected a motion calling for same-sex couples to be married in the province.</p> <p>A joint proposal by Sinn Fein and the Green party to allow gay marriage was defeated because the Democratic Unionists (DUP) ensured that it would have to obtain cross community support in the parliament to succeed.</p> <p>Under the rules of the Stormont parliament, any party can trigger a so-called petition of concern on a motion that then can only pass if the majority of nationalists and unionists back it. The rule was drawn up to protect minorities and ensure that there would never be a return to unionist domination of the assembly. In this instance the DUP used the law to scupper any move to liberalise the law on gay marriage.</p> <p>Only three unionist assembly members out of 45 voted in favour of gay equality. Both the DUP and the Ulster Unionists came under pressure over the weekend from the Protestant churches not to change the law on gay marriage.</p> <p>In a letter to assembly men and women the Presbyterian church said it was \"not merely an issue of conscience for Christian people and churches, but a very significant one for the whole of society\".</p> <p>It said gay marriage would \"effectively demolish generations and centuries of societal norms established on Judeo-Christian values\".</p> <p>The Green party's sole representative in the Stormont assembly, Steven Agnew, said gay Christians were being \"denied rights and religious freedoms\".</p> <p>\"As the law stands at the moment, a couple without faith can get married in a church while a devoutly religious couple of the same sex cannot,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Whether a religious institution performs same-sex marriage ceremonies is a matter for the church involved, not the state. This is actually an extension of rights to religious institutions to make their own decisions on this issue.</p> <p>\"Therefore, the law preventing churches performing same-sex marriage ceremonies should be removed and instead legal protection should be given to churches to allow then to determine what they define as marriage.\"</p> <p>Only half of the cross-community, liberal Alliance party turned up to vote on the gay marriage debate.</p>",
  "<p>From today, around a million workers will benefit from a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/01/minimum-wage-over-21s-rises\" title=\"\">rise in the minimum wage</a>. Their earnings won't go up by much \u2013 a rise of 11p per hour is actually a pay cut in real terms. And as for young people working for the minimum wage, those that have jobs at all, they aren't likely to get any pay rise at all.</p> <p>The small increase in the minimum wage is symptomatic of what's happening to wages across the economy. For the last three years, wages have been falling in real terms, as the cost of living outstrips paltry pay rises. TUC research out this week estimates that the average worker on \u00a326,000 is around \u00a31,500 poorer than they were three years ago.</p> <p>Listening to government ministers you'd think it was the old foes of red tape and bloated public services that were holding the economy back. But neither of these were much of a brake in the decades running up to the financial crash.</p> <p>A far better way to assess the poor health of the economy is to look at consumer spending \u2013 the main driver of economic growth in the UK. Here, falling wages, tax rises and cuts to tax credits are making people poorer. We are all spending less money as the country is gripped in the tightest squeeze on living standards since the 1920s.</p> <p>The origins of this income squeeze go back far longer than the financial crash. The proportion of economic gains going on wages has been falling for 30 years. Over the last few decades this was covered up by strong employment growth, new support such as tax credits and rising personal debt. This support is unlikely to continue into the next decade.</p> <p>Of course some have been immune to this squeeze. The pay of those at the top soared away during the boom and has failed to come back down to Earth after the crash.</p> <p>Now that we're all feeling the effects of a failed executive pay culture based on short-termism and stock market bubbles, we need to re-examine the way we set pay from the bottom to the very top of business.</p> <p>The twin track of wage growth since the turn of the century is illustrated by a statistic calculated by <a href=\"http://t.co/HUKSbUDL\" title=\"\">One Society</a>, which found that if the minimum wage had increased at the same rate as the pay of FTSE 100 directors since its introduction in 1999, it would now be almost \u00a319 an hour, rather than its current rate of \u00a36.19.</p> <p>This tells us just how out of control pay at the top is and how hard life is for those struggling along at the bottom.</p> <p>We will hear lots of plans for growth during the party conference season. But the issue that the TUC \u2013 and the vast majority of ordinary working people, I suspect \u2013 want to hear more about from all parties is pay.</p> <p>Wages are fundamental to our economic recovery. We need decent pay to lift people out of poverty, helped by a higher minimum wage and a more widespread living wage. We need a better chance of a comfortable income for those in the middle, helped by encouraging more skilled jobs in growing industries. We need fairer wages for those in the boardroom, with employees having a seat on remuneration boards and packages that run in line with the long-term health of a company and not its short-term share price. And, of course, we need strong unions and more collective bargaining. That is the best way to ensure that all workers get the level of pay they deserve and that employers can afford, and so build a stronger and fairer economy for the future.</p>",
  "<p><em>The Open University has topped this year's National Student Survey for overall student satisfaction. Meanwhile, we are seeing a growth in e-learning and Moocs (massive open online courses). Will traditional university campuses decline to make way for e-learning?</em></p> <p><strong>Peter Scott, director of the Knowledge Media Institute, Open University</strong></p> <p>\"It's a little strong to say the campus is over because academics function very well together in these spaces, but why do students need to come and sit and receive knowledge in one-hour chunks from us? It is not that the campus has gone, because students still gather together to discuss and learn. But they don't necessarily need to live on the campus and they don't necessarily need to gather in large groups to receive the wisdom of the lecturer. We need new physical spaces to complement the new virtual spaces we now have.\"</p> <p><strong>David Kernohan, UK open educational resources programme manager at Jisc, which advises universities on new technologies</strong></p> <p>\"Universities are no longer keepers of knowledge, they are more like guides to knowledge. Rather than knowledge being a lot of stuff being held at university and you have to go there, the connected world and the rise of quality online resources means a big change in what a university is and what it does. There might be fewer mass lectures delivered because it's a more efficient use of resources to record the lecture and let students watch and rewatch it at their leisure. But there is still a place for small group teaching and seminars. It's incredibly difficult to replace that experience in an online way.\"</p> <p><strong>Nick Pringle, University of Manchester students' union</strong></p> <p>\"If you took away the campus from Manchester's Fresher's Week, the atmosphere would be very different. There is real optimism around and a feeling that would be lost if it was all done online and through email.</p> <p>A campus brings greater challenges, which perhaps explains the survey results. But the moving away from home and learning and discovering things that you get through living in halls of residence, and the interaction with other students \u2013 the fact that you could be living in a flat with people from all continents in the world \u2013 is a really exciting opportunity. Being in a city like Manchester, which is a real destination in terms of its music and social scene, is really important to students here. It's not all about drinking and clubbing. It's also about cultural events.\"</p> <p><strong>Shai Reshef, president of University of the&#xa0;People, a tuition-free, non-profit online academic institution that aims to democratise higher education</strong></p> <p>\"I think online is going to be much more relevant than it is now because we are talking about a generation for whom online is natural. Many young people socialise through the internet and meet their friends online. It can also be way less expensive. For millions around the world, online learning is the only choice, and in future more so because the cost of higher education is continuing to rise and the cost of technology is continuing to decline. It won't be the end of campus life but there will be less of it.\"</p> <p><strong>David White, researcher into e-learning and co-manager of technology assisted lifelong learning, University of Oxford</strong></p> <p>\"It comes down to belonging. Experienced providers know how to foster a sense of being part of a cohort for distance students, but it's not easy. If you go to a face-to-face lecture, it's an event you go to at a particular moment in time. Even if the lecture isn't great, even if you don't agree with the pedagogy of lectures, the fact is you are sitting there with all the other students and it's very motivating.</p> <p>That's what campus universities do very well. Through things like local pubs and societies you become part of something wider. Going to university wasn't ever particularly designed as only learning a specific curriculum. It's a life experience. The risk is it becomes the preserve of those who can afford it.\"</p> <p><strong>Allison Littlejohn, director of Glasgow Caledonian University's Caledonian Academy and professor of learning technology</strong></p> <p>\"The future is people having more control over their own learning. That might include certified education \u2013 education as we know it and a three or four year degree. But there will be a much wider selection of formal education and non-formal learning that people take forward themselves. We need to better prepare learners in the UK to have the confidence and skills and abilities to set their own goals and understand how they might go about achieving those goals because there is going to be much more fluidity in the future about how we set our careers and direction.\"</p> <p><strong>Isabelle Barrett, studying part-time for&#xa0;a&#xa0;certificate of higher education in community education and governance at the University of Gloucestershire</strong></p> <p>\"In my situation, it's really nice not to have to travel on to campus, but my son is looking forward to going to university because it takes him away from home and to new experiences. Personally, I think there are a lot of other methods for communication now. At campuses you rack up a lot of debt. I have had that debate with my son but he feels the experience will be worth it. Other than student life and sitting in a big lecture room, I can't see what you would miss out on.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022\u2009Sharp but blunt union boss, Len McCluskey of Unite, gave the conference a rip-roaring denunciation of banks, coalitions and \"the siren voices\" of neo-liberalism. But the big three unions' other general secretaries, Paul Kenny of the GMB and Unison's Dave Prentis, have been telling comrades in the bar that Len himself proved susceptible to the neo-liberal siren voice of Rupert Murdoch ahead of the conference. McCluskey's Sunday Times interview was hyped into a predictable \"unions to seize control of world\" page one headline \u2013 as Kenny and Prentis guessed it would be. Both men turned the paper down.</p> <p>Tony Blair's former press chief Alastair Campbell is \"thinking about\" standing for election at the next general election, he revealed yesterday. Asked on LBC radio whether he had ambitions to become an MP, he said: \"All I'll say to you is I get a lot of people asking me, particularly when I'm up here, and I do think about it and I am thinking about it and I don't think there's a fantastic rush. We sort of know when the next election is.\"</p> <p>\u2022\u2009Manchester's smart Opus One restaurant has been doing recession-proof business just outside Labour's conference, its lobster-led menu easily costing \u00a360 a head for a decent three-courser.

It comes together as an Iced Vimto Parfait.</p> <p>\u2022\u2009The unmentionable Blair was always slightly suspicious of New Labour's polling guru, the late Philip Gould, so Alastair Campbell admitted at the launch of essays in his memory. Why? Because his focus groups always seemed to say what Gould thought. Gould used to warm up such groups with matey questions like: \" Your name is Jane? My first girlfriend was called Jane. She went on to commit suicide.\" Just the remark to thaw the ice.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Good day:</strong> Jim Murphy.

It produced the poster being driven around Manchester on a truck, depicting the two Eds, Miliband and Balls as gormless schoolboys.

At midday, 34,500 rials bought $1 on the open market, compared to 29,600 rials on Sunday's close, according to Iranian currency-monitoring websites.</p> <p>Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, had previously rejected predictions that the rial would drop as low as 30,000 rials against the dollar, saying that such suggestions amounted to little more than \"psychological war\". The latest news will come as a further blow to a president already widely seen as a lame duck. Ahmadinejad will stand down in June 2013, and cannot run for a third term under Iranian law.</p> <p>\"What an embarrassment for Ahmadinejad,\" said Farshad, a student at Tehran University. \"The economy is in crisis and he is either blind to it or simply doesn't want to see it.\"</p> <p>Western sanctions are compounding the country's economic woes, sending the national currency into a nosedive and making dollars hard to come by. The situation has worsened significantly in recent months; the latest US and EU sanctions on Tehran came into effect in July. As a result, the prices of chicken, milk, cheese, bread, sugar and yogurt, among other staples, are now rising almost every day.</p> <p>For Zohreh, a middle-aged housewife living in east Tehran, the current crisis evokes the bad old days of the Iran-Iraq war. \"It's like the war years, the price today is different from the price yesterday,\" she said. \"For certain items you have to queue up and some are not available anymore.\"</p> <p>Zohreh, like millions of other Iranians, receives a monthly government payment to families to compensate for a cut in subsidies. But she said the money, known as Yaraneh, no longer meets her needs. \"Just nine months ago, I used to go to the market with 120,000 rials in my pocket and come back home with a basket of vegetables, fruits and staples but now for [the] same items I have to pay 300,000 rials.\"</p> <p>The rial has lost 57% of its value in the past three months and 75% in comparison to the end of last year. The dollar is now three times stronger than early last year.</p> <p>Iran, one of the world's largest oil producers, relies on crude sales for 80% of its export revenue and to bring in most of the foreign currency. In the wake of the currency crisis, many Iranians who have lost faith in the rial are now contributing to its instability by rushing to convert their assets and properties to foreign currency and gold.</p> <p>\"The rial's fall has affected all aspects of life in Iran,\" said Amir, a shopkeeper in Tehran. \"It's not only the prices of imported items that are increasing but domestic products have also been affected.\" He pointed to the price of a box of domestically made cigarettes, Bahman, which he said had doubled since last year. \"You can only rely on foreign currency and gold these days in Iran.\"</p> <p>Among those bearing the brunt of the crisis are patients and hospitals reliant on currency for imported medicines and foreign-based services. Iran's Haemophilia Society, for example, has blamed the sanctions for risking thousands of children's lives due to a lack of proper drugs.</p> <p>The government has repeatedly attempted to bring the currency under control with no success. Last week it launched an exchange centre aimed at stabilising the rates, but the rial's fall has since increased.</p> <p>Previous attempts also include a sharp rise in interest rates in February and an order for an imposed exchange rate to be used both in banks and on the open market. At the time, the police were sent to exchange bureaux to implement the order but they reacted by closing down temporarily or refusing to buy or sell foreign currency on official rates.</p> <p>Hassan Hakimian, an Iranian economic expert and director of the London Middle East Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies, said: \"The rapid depreciation of the rial reflects mainly negative market sentiments and an expectation that the Iranian government will continue to experience severe difficulties in selling its oil in international markets as the sanctions noose tightens.\"</p> <p>Iran's economic weaknesses \u2013 perpetually high unemployment and government mismanagement \u2013 have been masked in recent years by the high price of oil but its very dependency on oil means the embargo has had a significant impact.</p> <p>Despite the recent rial crisis, Hakimian believes the Iranian economy is still not on the brink of collapse.</p> <p>\"Talk of collapse as the Israeli minister of finance has recently mentioned is inaccurate and emotive. The enormous difficulties experienced could in the worst-case scenario result in a freefall for the currency (like in Zimbabwe) and result in hyperinflation (again as in Zimbabwe). Even unpopular governments in such harsh situations survive.\"</p> <p>He added: \"These are harsh times for the ordinary Iranians and there is no doubt that since the end of war with Iraq in the late 1980s, they have not experienced such hardship and uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is a serious risk \u2013 looking at Iran from the outside \u2013 that the US and EU will take this as prima facie evidence that sanctions are 'working': the logic being that 'if it is hurting, it is working'.\"</p> <p>Britain, France and Germany are pushing for already tough EU sanctions on Iran to be tightened further later this month, to close some of the larger loopholes. Among the measures being sought are stricter maritime controls, which would make it harder for Iran to reflag its ships to sidestep shipping and insurance sanctions. Western European countries also want to put more Iranian banks on the banned list. Rather than targeting specific firms, which can change names to stay ahead of sanctions, the UK is proposing the imposition of sanctions on whole sectors of trade with Iran to cover materials that could help Tehran expand its nuclear programme, particularly uranium enrichment.</p> <p>Britain also wants loopholes closed on oil sanctions, though officials would not say whether the new measures would target the National Iranian Oil Company, which Washington last month explicitly linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard.</p> <p>London, Paris and Berlin are seeking to have the upgraded sanctions agreed at a meeting of EU foreign ministers on 15 October, but the proposals are meeting resistance from other member states concerned over their rebound effect on the European economy. British officials are unsure whether agreement can be reached in time.</p> <p>In Washington on Monday, a former US ambassador to the UN and under-secretary of state, Thomas Pickering, questioned the logic behind US sanctions.</p> <p>\"We issue licences for sales of food and medicine to Iran, but it is not legal for them to pay for it,\" Pickering told a meeting of the National Iranian American Council.</p>",
  "<p>Making a Handel oratorio that was conceived for concert performances work as an opera (essentially a theatrical experience) is no easy exercise. <a href=\"http://www.wno.org.uk\" title=\"\">When Welsh National Opera</a>'s staging was premiered in 2003, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/may/20/classicalmusicandopera.artsfeatures1\" title=\"\">it realised an intensity that was wholly compelling</a>. However this second revival fared less well; the tension in the relationships between central characters was not always dynamic enough to sustain the emotional pitch through the evening.</p> <p>Director Katie Mitchell has transposed the Old Testament story of Jephtha to late 1940s Europe, and has set the action in a much-bombarded hotel that retains a faded glory. Against a background of the strategising of war, a personal and moral dilemma unfolds. Jephtha, leader of the Israelites, strikes a bargain with God: in return for victory against the Ammonites, he promises to sacrifice the first person to greet him after the battle. Triumph becomes torment when he must execute his beloved daughter, Iphis. She is spared death, thanks to the&nbsp;benign intervention of an angel (contrary to the biblical version), but is&nbsp;consigned to live out her days in a nunnery. <a href=\"http://www.fflurwyn.com\" title=\"\">Fflur Wyn</a>'s soprano, now fuller toned than when she sang Iphis six years ago, still has a bright ring, giving her arias a defining edge. It is also her plight that is the most affecting, since losing her love Hamor (countertenor <a href=\"http://www.rayfieldallied.com/artists/robin-blaze\" title=\"\">Robin Blaze</a>) is tantamount to losing her life.</p> <p>As Jephtha, tenor <a href=\"http://www.askonasholt.co.uk/artists/singers/tenor/robert-murray\" title=\"\">Robert Murray</a> is fluent, his paternal anguish apparent, and <a href=\"http://www.intermusica.co.uk/artists/mezzosoprano/diana-montague/biography\" title=\"\">Diana Montague</a> as his wife, Storge, is expressive, though neither elicits total sympathy. Key dramatic moments are also somewhat compromised with <a href=\"http://www.musicint.co.uk/artists_3_10_130_s_1_baritone-bass-alan-ewing/\" title=\"\">Alan Ewing</a>'s disappointing Zehul; <a href=\"http://www.claireormshaw.com\" title=\"\">Claire Ormishaw</a>'s Angel is similarly lacking, a&nbsp;mechanical rather than charismatic presence.

  "<p>The director of public prosecutions has refused to charge two suspected Islamists with terrorism offences, easing the way for their extradition to the US.</p> <p>Keir Starmer QC announced his decision on the fate of Babar Ahmad and Syed Talha Ahsan in advance of their last-ditch appeal against deportation in the high court on Tuesday.</p> <p>The two men and three others \u2013 including the radical cleric Abu Hamza \u2013 are expected make applications for injunctions halting their removal to the US, where they are wanted for alleged terrorism offences.</p> <p>During a day of fast-moving legal manoeuvres, representatives of all five men \u2013 Ahmad, Ahsan, Abu Hamza, Adel Abdul Bary, and Khaled al-Fawwaz \u2013 were lodging appeals and finalising court documents. The claims will be heard at the Royal Courts of Justice before Sir John Thomas, president of the Queen's bench division, and Mr Justice Ouseley. Last week the European court of human rights in Strasbourg rejected any further appeals to its upper chamber, agreeing with an earlier ruling that the human rights of the five terrorism suspects would not be violated by the prospect of life sentences or solitary confinement in a US supermax prison.</p> <p>The decision was seen as clearing the way for their deportation following an eight-year battle through British and European courts. The Home Office believes the decision should have exhausted legal avenues and is preparing to send them to the US. But all five are making desperate last attempts to prevent their removal.</p> <p>Supporters of Ahmad and Ahsan have called for them to be prosecuted in this country for their alleged connection to an extremist website. The DPP had been considering a formal request to consent to a private prosecution, and said he had declined to support the charges.</p> <p>\"I have refused to give my consent to Mr [Karl] Watkin to bring a private prosecution against Mr Ahmad and Mr Ahsan for offences under the Terrorism Act 2000,\" Starmer said. \"The underlying evidence in support of these alleged offences is in the possession of the USA. The material provided to me in support of the proposed private prosecution has been carefully considered by a specialist lawyer in the CPS special crime and counter-terrorism division.\"</p> <p>Starmer said he had also consulted the attorney general, Dominic Grieve QC. \"I have received written confirmation that the Metropolitan Police Service do not intend to refer any further documents or other material to the CPS for consideration,\" the DPP said.</p> <p>The grounds of Ahmad's application to the high court was that the DPP must be given more time to consider whether or not a private prosecution against him and Ahsan could go ahead in the UK.</p> <p>Ahmad, 38, has been held in detention without trial since 2004. Before hearing the DPP's announcement, Ahmad's family said: \"We are simply asking for the court to put a hold on Babar's extradition so that the DPP has the necessary time and space to make a decision on the material provided to him in April 2012 which was kept hidden from him by the police for eight years.</p> <p>\"The DPP has confirmed that he is considering this material in addition to the request by Mr Karl Watkin for permission to privately prosecute Babar in the UK. We trust that the court will find that this is a reasonable request which is both in the public interest and the interests of justice.\"</p> <p>Labour's justice spokesman, Sadiq Khan, has supported calls for Ahmad to be prosecuted in the UK for his alleged involvement in an extremist website. Watkin is separately seeking permission from magistrates to bring a private prosecution that does not require the DPP's consent.</p> <p>Legal sources suggested the home secretary, Theresa May, had discretion about whether or not to suspend an extradition order after a private prosecution has begun.</p> <p>Last week the lord chief justice, Lord Judge, said lengthy delays in the courts were a source of fury for him but warned that new appeals based on fresh points of law could always extend cases.</p>",

And it might have worked well, had Muse not decided once again to self-produce the album. There are some excellent songs here, such as the INXS-flavoured Panic Station and the unusual (for Muse) 5/4 beat of Animals. Unfortunately, for most of the album it is let down by being rather bland in the arrangements. Madness, a very simple song comprising synth bass, drums and vocals until halfway through, suffers greatly because of the lack of spark in the recording. Follow Me, with assistance from of-the-moment dance producer Nero, suffers mainly because of the jumping about in styles mid\u2013song \u2013 it can't decide whether it wants to be a rocker in the style of Map of the Problematique, or a dance track, or something else entirely.</p> <p>Muse are a band that have in the past prided themselves on pushing the limits of what they can do, both sonically and visually. In the past this has led to stunning songs like Knights of Cydonia, or Stockholm Syndrome, but on The 2nd Law it seems they've taken a step backwards. Perhaps in pushing the limits of their songwriting into emotional territories they have forgotten just how to create epic soundscapes. To this \"reviewer\", it seems as if they have missed a great opportunity to get back on track after the very hit-and-miss previous album. But The 2nd Law just feels undercooked in places, overcooked in others \u2013 rather like a chicken that's been in a microwave. There are also far too many different influences and musical styles fighting for attention here, it doesn't have any cohesion or flow to it. It's as if Muse are a band that are desperately trying other people's ideas because they've run out of their own.</p> <p>Perhaps instead of The 2nd Law, Muse could have named the album after another concept \u2013 The Law of Diminishing Returns.</p> <p>\u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/album/422cd8ac-8599-4356-b874-4da79a06abac\" title=\"\">chizzle</a></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/album/9d7dfd6e-06f2-4b93-92f9-d998be825257\" title=\"\">Kanye West presents GOOD Music: Cruel Summer</a></h2> <p>GOOD Music boasts some of the best and most respected artists in the industry regardless of their genre \u2013 eg, Kanye West, Pusha T, Common and John Legend, to name a few. So the question is, does Cruel Summer live up to the hype?</p> <p>Overall, Cruel Summer has some highlights, like Clique, Mercy and New God Flow, but the problem is we've all heard them before. Because half of the tracklist content has been floating on YouTube, it loses its freshness. The songs we haven't heard, apart from the terrific The Morning, are slovenly and superficial. Kanye the perfectionist that we're used to hearing on amazing albums such as College Dropout and My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is missing, and this makes for an underwhelming experience. The GOOD roster is so talented and unfortunately this album doesn't showcase that. It contains moments of brilliance that are unfortunately too sparse for talents of this kind.</p> <p>\u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/album/9d7dfd6e-06f2-4b93-92f9-d998be825257\" title=\"\">Ella December</a></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/album/08f53230-984f-45ff-ab63-550128ef3bf0\" title=\"\">Four by Bloc Party </a></h2> <p>After sticking to the indie formula for the first two albums pretty strictly, and being pulled by Kele into slightly dancier territories for Intimacy, Four sees Bloc Party spreading their wings musically. We get glimpses into pretty hardcore punk on We're Not Good People, deep south American blues with a hint of grungey metal that Jack White would be proud of on Coliseum. However, it's obvious that Bloc Party are at their most comfortable on the familiar territory of the falsetto indie ballads or anthems that Kele loves so much, making The Healing a great song: a very John Squire guitar riff and long underlying bass notes as the lyrics bare Kele's soul over the mix.</p> <p>Throughout this album, Kele doesn't shy away from being brutally honest in his lyrics. It suits him and Bloc Party's style \u2013 in fact, it sounds laboured and awkward when they seem to trying to shoot for Muse-level epicness. Album openers So He Begins to Lie and 3x3 seem to fall by the wayside as forced headbanging songs trying to muscle their way into a band that was never in that field of making people move. Real Talk is a real highlight, a slow message to the fans with a killer opening line \"Can we get real for a moment? You're my one and only friend\" delivered between punchy stabs from the bass and guitar.</p> <p>This album is a football cliche \u2013 it's a game of two halves. On the one hand, Day Four, The Healing, Real Talk and VALIS are \"old\" Bloc Party. They sound familiar, yet fresh and more mature, with Russell especially toning down the guitar parts, letting the honesty of the lyrics come through. On the other hand, we have the side of Bloc Party that thinks it's part Metallica part Slipknot. We're Not Good People, So He Begins to Lie and Kettling feel unnatural and brutish, despite being not awful songs in themselves.</p> <p>As far as a standalone album goes, it's hampered by the distortion demons of a few tracks, but it clearly shows that Kele is still passionate and excellent in his range and the songs complement his falsetto and his great range all the time.</p> <p>\u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/album/08f53230-984f-45ff-ab63-550128ef3bf0\" title=\"\">sneakypetey</a></p>",

Barton was one of 58 people wounded, along with 12 killed, when a gunman opened fire in an Aurora cinema on the opening night of The Dark Knight Rises on 20 July.</p> <p>The Century 16 movie theater is located just 10 miles away from the University of Denver where Barack Obama and Mitt Romney will go head to head. In a quirk of scheduling, the first TV debate will also take place about 10 miles in the other direction from Columbine high school where the 1999 rampage claimed 13 lives.</p> <p>Barton believes that the confluence of geography is too great to ignore. \"I want to see the moderator on Wednesday night ask the candidates what policies they would implement as president to prevent future tragedies like Aurora and Columbine, and then push them on it.</p> <p>\"I want to hear serious discussion beyond just lamenting the fact that they happened.\"</p> <p>Barton has joined forces with <a href=\"http://www.mayorsagainstillegalguns.org/html/home/home.shtml\">Mayors Against Illegal Guns</a>, a coalition of 725 mayors from towns and cities across America that campaigns for tighter vetting procedures to prevent criminals, domestic violence offenders and people with severe mental illnesses from acquiring firearms. He <a href=\"http://www.demandaplan.org/aurora\">appears in a new TV ad</a> in which he sits in an empty cinema, much like the one in Aurora, and warns that unless changes are made the equivalent of more than 200 packed theaters \u2013 some 48,000 Americans \u2013 will die from gun violence during the next president's four-year term.</p> <p>\"I do expect the candidates to be confronted about this issue, and I'll certainly be disappointed if they aren't,\" he said in an interview with the Guardian.</p> <h2>'It should certainly be on the minds of Americans'</h2> <p>A string of coincidences brought Barton, 22, to the Aurora cinema that fateful night. A graduate of Syracuse University, he was coming towards the end of a coast-to-coast cycle ride across America which he was making with his friend Ethan Rodriguez-Torrent.</p> <p>Reaching Denver after 2,750 miles, they bought three tickets to the premier showing of The Dark Knight Rises. The third ticket was a thank-you present for their host, a woman who had read about their cross-country ride on Facebook and contacted them out of the blue to offer them hospitality.</p> <p>About 15 minutes in to the film, Barton noticed a streak across the screen and some flashes of light in the corner of the cinema. He assumed it was fireworks, until the screaming started.</p> <p>Almost immediately, he was hit by 25 pellets from the shooter's rifle. One hit him in the face, and five in the neck, entering perilously close to vital arteries; the scar tracks are from surgery to remove the pellets.</p> <p>Rodriguez-Torrent escaped injury, but their host was struck by a pellet that entered her naval cavity and transversed her brain, lodging at the back of her skull. Miraculously, its path managed to avoid crucial areas of the brain, and she is making a good recovery.</p> <p>\"Naturally, I feel strange about her, and I sometimes wonder how her family sees my friend and me. After all, she was there in the cinema because we were there,\" Barton says.</p> <p>Until the tragedy, he had never been actively engaged in the issue of gun control. \"Like most people I thought this was never going to happen to me, so I didn't have to worry about it.\"</p> <p>Now he reflects on the 34 people who lose their lives every day in the US because of gun violence and is determined to do something about it. \"That's a big number. It should certainly be on the minds of Americans even if it's not something they have to deal with personally.\"</p> <p>The new TV advert featuring Barton is part of the <a href=\"www.DemandAPlan.org\">Demand a Plan</a> campaign that brings Mayors Against Illegal Guns together with the survivors of rampages and victims families to call for a concrete legislative plan to reduce the annual carnage. Its petition has been signed by more than 250,000.</p> <p>Specifically, the campaign wants to see background checks extended to all gun owners.</p> <p>Currently, about 40% of guns are sold by private sellers and do not require a background check under federal law.</p> <p>The suspect in the murders, James Holmes, had undergone vetting when he bought a rifle, shotgun and two handguns. It is not yet known, however, whether signs he displayed before the shooting of a vulnerable mental state were reported to authorities.</p> <p>Barton is still undergoing physical therapy for the result of his wounds and has delayed by a year a Fulbright scholarship to Russia to teach English. He says he is fully aware of the political hurdles in Washington to confronting gun safety, but adds that the stasis in Congress will not deter him from demanding action.</p> <p>\"I've come to the conclusion that if I \u2013 someone shot in one of these gun tragedies \u2013 was not prepared to talk about this, then I couldn't be frustrated about the lack of political discourse in Washington,\" he says.</p>",

And so the news that the label had signed another new rap act, called Ratking, was always going to pique our interest. They haven't quite arrived with the hype and myth-story of Odd Future, who unveiled a whole new modus operandi \u2013 being an 11-strong \"Wolf Gang\" who handled design, videos etc and came with a radical worldview that could <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KoIYwcmIuU\" title=\"\">reasonably be described as post-moral</a>. They were, as <a href=\"http://thequietus.com/articles/05810-the-strange-and-frightening-world-of-odd-future-tyler-the-creator\" title=\"\">the great John Calvert over at the Quietus so evocatively put it</a>, \"ready to think you out of existence\".</p> <p>There isn't anything \u2013 yet \u2013 that we can discern about Ratking meriting such pithy bullet-points or sense of duck-and-cover. On <a href=\"http://www.oddfuturetalk.com/forums/topic/25310-the-official-wiki-ratking-crew-thread/\" title=\"\">the OF forum there has been a bit of talk about them</a>, mainly focusing on the high, nasal flow of one of their two MCs, Patrick \"Wiki\" Morales, an 18-year-old from Manhattan who took his alias from a rather well-known internet site and has been compared, predictably, to the young Eminem, although there have also been mentions of ODB and <a href=\"http://www.yelawolfpack.com\" title=\"\">Yelawolf</a>. Morales is the self-confessed \"upper-middle-class\" son of an Irish mother and Puerto Rican banker from New York's Upper West Side, where he still lives. He's been a fan of both rap and rock since his early teens: aged 13, he was spotted in the audience by GZA and invited to join the Wu-Tang Clan onstage at one of their gigs; and he grew up listening to US hardcore bands such as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMEWO8vNGEQ\" title=\"\">the Germs</a> (he has their motto NOGOD tattooed across his chest) and played in a band of his own called the Homo-Thugs, a liberal-baiting name worthy of <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Steve \"Rapeman\" Albini</a>.</p> <p>Now he's in Ratking with fellow MC Hak and producers Sporting Life and Ramon. They're due to visit Europe for the first time this month before undertaking their first full US tour in November and December ahead of their debut album, set to come out in 2013 and with Jay-Z's Young Guru already lined up to engineer and mix. Apparently it will explore their many and diverse influences, from Animal Collective to Suicide. It will also, we are told, reflect \"a city in which delicate perfumed beauty sits beside rancid mangled poverty\" (weird: we thought New York's process of gentrification had left no borough sullied, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/09/nyregion/as-brooklyn-gentrifies-some-neighborhoods-are-being-left-behind.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">but we could be wrong</a>) and provide an antidote to \"a bloated and self-satisfied hip-hop [and] the nihilist refrain of dead-end punk\". It is, they decide, \"no wave\" rap or \"no school\" hip-hop.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uWdNuPYh0Hk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uWdNuPYh0Hk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWdNuPYh0Hk\" title=\"\">Reading this on mobile?

Ratking only have Ratking, but they do their best to cram a lot of sounds and ideas into those six songs. Wikispeaks is wonky, Wiki himself effecting a snarky, sneaky and cheeky flow over a blunted and enchanted, sci-fi jazzy groove. Ratking's agenda may not involve hate or destruction, but it could well be to subvert through gently dislocating weirdness. Is the title a comment on the ubiquity of banal information these days? While you're pondering that, try <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q9VJc-2bwg\" title=\"\">Comic</a>, its swirling noise'n'FX pleasantly disorienting, the jolting beat less R&amp;B-jerky than grime-itchy (there's a video of Ratking wearing hoodies and hanging over decks and it looks more like a high-rise inner London Rinse FM tableau than it does a US ghetto one). Sporting Life is pretty out-there sample-wise: the sonics are redolent of post-punk electronica, or experimental hip-hop, equal parts Cabaret Voltaire and Cannibal Ox. Pretty Picture also features looped, jarring samples, while Retired Sports pivots on an interminably repeated two-seconds of mad avant-skronk, which then turns into spacey shimmerfunk halfway.</p> <p>The music on the EP is uniformly interesting, even if Ratking haven't quite managed the OF trick of producing amazing music dramatically at odds with the meanness of the lyrics. But then, Tyler and co's intent was clear. Ratking's agenda is less obvious, beyond the usual new-band imperative to shake things up. <a href=\"http://www.xxlmag.com/the-break/2012/06/the-break-presents-ratking/\" title=\"\">There's footage of them on the net performing live another track, not on the EP, called 1993</a>, presumably titled after the year of their birth. It shows mildly interested white kids looking on, their interests piqued as ours was. Whether or not that will convert to full-on furore remains to be seen.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"They are probably the most exciting rap act to be coming out of the city at the moment\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.thatsdeck.com/2012/09/stream-ratking-wikispeaks.html\" title=\"\">thatsdeck.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> They're Wiki, guy.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Spread un-ease.</p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> Spread disease.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> The Wiki93 EP is released by XL/Hot Charity on 6 November.</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> Eminem, This Heat, Danny Brown, OF.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ratking/260450144007425\" title=\"\">facebook.com/pages/Ratking/260450144007425</a>.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday's new band:</strong> Naytronix.</p>",
  "<p>Arthur Ochs \"Punch\" Sulzberger, the former publisher and chairman of the New York times, whose death at 86 is getting head-of-state treatment (at least <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/30/nyregion/arthur-o-sulzberger-publisher-who-transformed-times-dies-at-86.html?pagewanted=all\">by the New York Times</a>), was a very nice, old-fashioned and, within the confines of his peculiarly aristocratic upbringing, intelligent man. </p> <p>What he was not is the pro-active, derring-do, man-on-a-mission leader and publisher that the instant reminiscences (most prepared well in advance) are painting him to be. In a way, he was much more interesting than that: he was a man who, by calculation, cultural understanding, and personal temperament, did not do much at all. He restrained himself. </p> <p>The depictions of him as a modern activist CEO, when, in fact, he was not the CEO at all, probably have as much do with the lack of language to describe a leader in other positive terms. It hardly sounds laudable to say he was a remote, class-conscious, phlegmatic, slow-to-action, caretaker owner. Reading between the lines, this is, in fact, the virtue that both <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/01/opinion/punch-sulzberger-and-his-times.html\">Max Frankel</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/01/opinion/remembering-punch-sulzberger.html\">Arthur Gelb</a>, both long-time senior editors at the paper, describe in their op-ed tributes: a remarkable level of non-interference. He regularly attended the \"page one\" meetings of the paper he owned and said absolutely nothing. But both Frankel and Gelb attribute this to a calculated strategy, instead of a kind of splendid disengagement. </p> <p>Once, in 1974, when I was a copy-boy at the New York Times I got caught on my way to work in a flash storm. By the time I arrived at the Times building on West 43rd Street, I was soaked to the skin \u2013 shivering and ridiculous-looking. Whereupon the elevator doors opened and an affable and smiling publisher, said, \"Is it raining?\"</p> <p>As the Times prepared to go public in the late sixties, its rather peculiar management structure \u2013 a titular boss, and paid professionals who, in most matters, were not required to consult him \u2013 had to be rationalized. Many years later, one of the architects of the public offering, described for me how the Sulzberger family saw its mission and how lawyers adapted it into a structure.</p> <p>The Sulzbergers were the British royal family. They represented the paper, its values and its future. They stood for something, rather than acted for something. The paper itself, its day to operations and decisions, were to be handled by professional newspapermen \u2013 arguably, among the best who have ever been. There was, certainly, a class point here: people of a certain breeding don't, well, work.</p> <p>This was one of the justifications or rationalizations for the company's unusual share structure, wherein the family sold the majority of the company to the public, but maintained voting control: the family as above the fray, ultimate moral arbiters, and not management at all. (Later, this structure would become the tool of media managers everywhere who wanted to insure their own control.)</p> <p>This was an approach that uniquely suited the most influential paper in America \u2013 almost a branch of government itself. But it was also an approach that acknowledged the peculiar history of family ownership in the newspaper business. In the three or four generations since the invention of linotype and the mass distribution of newspapers, many newspapers had fallen on hard times \u2013 not least because newspaper heirs turned out to be a special order of nincompoop.</p> <p>This is not hard to explain. In their individual communities, newspaper heirs were invariably princelings, with all the arrogance, entitlement and insecurity that implies. When they actually tried to manage these complicated cultural and manufacturing operations, the results were disastrous. </p> <p>The Times had elegantly avoided the clash of temperament and function. And then, the possibly inevitable, and potentially tragic, happened: someone named Sulzberger actually wanted a job. </p> <p>Shortly after becoming chairman and publisher, in 1997, Punch Sulzberger's son, Arthur Sulzberger Jr, began to actually take control. Indeed, he seemed to want to be not just an aggressive top executive, but a media mogul, too. He was not just the top man, he let it be known, but the public face of the paper as well.</p> <p>Arguably, more than the challenge of the internet itself, this was the major change in the circumstance of the modern New York Times: a family member was running the company. The Times was no longer an historic trust; it was a personal issue. The one thing his father had taken out of the equation was put back in: ego.</p> <p>True, the formal structure under which his father had presided over the company, continued. There was a CEO and an executive editor who reported to the publisher/chairman. But, in fact, the publisher/chairman had become the CEO, too.</p> <p>Some years ago, when the level of Arthur Jr's involvement in the operating aspects of the paper had become clear, I marveled, to one of the executives who had a hand in designing the monarchical structure in the 1960, how incredible it was that Arthur was, in effect, running the newsroom.</p> <p>\"The Newsroom!\" Said this Timesman. \"Even more incredibly, he's running the business side!\"</p> <p>With a long litany of scandals, management turmoil, bad business decisions, steep declines in almost every metrics, and now, existential questions about the nature of the paper's survival, no one would say Arthur Jr has run it well. And because he has managed the company with full control of the voting shares, there has been no one to call him on it.</p> <p>In a way perhaps, no other role existed for him, noblesse oblige being out of fashion. But the real story about Punch Sulzberger, and the real sense of loss, is not for a man who brilliantly ran the paper, or introduced it into the modern age, or who protected journalism, but for a man who knew his place.</p>",
  "<p>The National Theatre is celebrating what artistic director Nicholas Hytner called a \"spectacular\" summer of shows playing to \"all intents and purposes 100% audiences\" on London's South Bank and in the West End.</p> <p>But, he said, the government must \"restore our funding\" in the medium to long-term. The financial health of the National was based on its string of successful transfers into the commercial West End, such as War Horse and One Man, Two Guv'nors, and there was, he said, no guarantee that the theatre would keep on earning at such high levels.</p> <p>Much more grave, he added, was the situation for regional theatres, most of which have been hit by \"a double blow\" \u2013 cuts both to their Arts Council England grants and to their local authority funding. This, he said, had put them \"in clear and present danger\". Funding cuts, he said, must be reversed.</p> <p>The success and prominence of the Cultural Olympiad showed that it would be \"a kind of madness, a kind of mania\" for the government to make further cuts to the arts. \"This government is obviously not going to lose its obsession with the deficit but if you are looking for ways to spend a little and get maximum return \u2013 then here we are.\"</p> <p>\"You look at the amount of joy that was spread this summer, and you hope that the government would continue to invest in arts and sport,\" said Hytner.</p> <p>He said that the government was guilty of \"neglecting\" the arts \u2013 they are \"not looking hard enough,\" he said. \"But you have to be trying pretty hard not to be looking, to be honest,\" he added.</p> <p>Hytner said that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/11/peter-bazalgette-big-brother-challenge\" title=\"\">Arts Council England \u2013 whose new chair, Peter Bazelgette</a>, is a regular patron of the National \u2013 was doing \"under difficult circumstances every bit as good a job as could be expected\".</p> <p>But he spoke out against its Scottish equivalent, Creative Scotland, where the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/09/arts-body-scottish-culture\" title=\"\">relationship between the cultural sector and its funding body has hit crisis point</a> after the organisation announced its intention to engage in \"strategic commissioning\", with artists fearing the body will exert too much control over the nature of work made.</p> <p>Hytner said: \"It's none of my business but from my perspective, it is more than slightly alarming that a funding body should regard itself as a commissioning body: that's not what funding bodies should do.</p> <p>\"And from the outside, I wonder too how I would feel if a senior director at a funding body told me I should be more entrepreneurial, more like Cirque du Soleil. I would have concerns about that.\" Hytner was referring to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/may/17/scottish-arts-shakeup-funding-one-off-projects\" title=\"\">remarks made earlier this year by Venu Dhupa</a>, creative director at Creative Scotland.</p> <p>The National Theatre is now embarking on a \u00a370m redevelopment, with a new space, due to open in April, being constructed in its river-facing courtyard to replace, for at least a year, the Cottesloe Theatre while building work continues. Hytner has pledged to continue in his role as artistic director until after the redevelopment is complete. He is currently rehearsing Alan Bennett's new play People, which previews from 31 October.</p>",
  "<p>The perfect Bond movie doesn't really exist. I recently spent about three weeks of evenings and weekends watching the entire canon back to back, and the notable thing about the films was how terrible most of them are. Bond acolytes, whose number I count myself among, tend to remember the highlights \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/79341/goldfinger\" title=\"\">Goldfingers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/78442/live-and-let-die\" title=\"\">Live and Let Dies</a>, or perhaps the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/60213/goldeneye\" title=\"\">GoldenEyes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/85424/dr-no\" title=\"\">Dr Nos</a> \u2013 but we forget that Sean Connery's later films were almost as awful as Roger Moore's, and that even the better 1960s entrants, such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/77693/from-russia-with-love\" title=\"\">From Russia with Love</a>, are hokey in the extreme.</p> <p>These are films usually watched with the thickest of rose-tinted glasses. Why? Because 007 has become such a virulent symbol of 60s cool that the early movies are now virtually critic-proof.</p> <p>That's why the best Bond movie has to be one that is abstracted from the series' heyday and all its attendant cultural gravy; one that was required to succeed not just as a great Bond film, but as a great film in its own right. One that many might argue was rather better for eschewing many of the tropes that people connect with the series, and one that on a critical level revived a franchise that most reviewers regarded as long past its sell-by date.</p> <p>Casino Royale also had a new 007, Daniel Craig, a muscular and rather stern-looking chap who brought a damaged determination to the role but had less of the suave flamboyance of earlier incarnations (proving that both he and Bond didn't really need it). Prior to his arrival on the scene, Brosnan was often mentioned as the best 007 since Connery. Yet so incendiary was Craig's first turn in the role that he instantly cast his predecessor as one of the weaker, lazier Bonds. (To my mind, only George Lazenby provided worse value.)</p> <p>Casino Royale also had probably the greatest actor ever to play a Bond girl in its ranks, with only Diana Rigg in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/77768/on-her-majesty-s-secret-service\" title=\"\">On Her Majesty's Secret Service</a> and Honor Blackman in Goldfinger capable of holding a candle to her. Frankly, Eon's casting agent should long ago have been fed to the sharks for some of the recruitment decisions made over the years: Jill St John in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/77221/diamonds-are-forever\" title=\"\">Diamonds Are Forever</a>, Britt Ekland in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/86577/man-with-the-golden-gun\" title=\"\">The Man with the Golden Gun</a> and Barbara Bach in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/79974/spy-who-loved-me\" title=\"\">The Spy Who Loved Me</a> all gave performances that would not have been out of place in the ream of cheap and cheesy Eurospy films that nipped at 007's gilded heels in the 60s. Eva Green as Vesper Lynd was so good that even Craig struggled to keep up with her at times: strong, sexy, exotic and feminine without ever ending up as putty in 007's hands. On the contrary, it is he that winds up falling for her, and it is nice to imagine Green as the kind of independent-minded girl who would not have taken the role had it been any other way.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H9fyOFefirQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H9fyOFefirQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9fyOFefirQ\" title=\"\">Reading this on mobile?

It was the first Bond film to borrow anything at all from the writer since 1987's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/78926/living-daylights\" title=\"\">The Living Daylights</a>, and the combination of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJubOZLpp4A\" title=\"\">modern-style hyper-kinetic fight scenes and parkour-influenced rooftop chases</a> with old skool glitz and glamour among Europe's high flyers and criminal kingpins delivered by far the coolest Bond movie since the early 1960s. Mads Mikkelsen as the sinister Le Chiffre came from the understated yet brutal school of Bond villains, lining up alongside <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIbIiFRpL5Y\" title=\"\">Live and Let Die's Mr Big</a>, Dr No or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXgj6Yl8RJw\" title=\"\">Telly Savalas's take on Ernst Blofeld in On Her Majesty's Secret Service</a>. Had the producers gone for a pumped-up clown of a bad guy such as Donald Pleasence's silly and irritating version of the latter, it would have completely undercut any sense of genuine threat to 007 and consequently ruined the movie.</p> <p>Of course, Casino Royale is not perfect: the scene in which Bond shows off his new Omega watch is a horrifying moment of in-your-face product placement, and producers still felt the need to hold to the old 007 trope of killing off at least one Bond girl. Yet it's hard to fault a film in which Craig manages to exhibit the physicality of Lazenby, the charm of Connery and the cruel determination of Live and Let Die-era Moore, along with the ability to express a gentler, more human side that had previously best been exemplified by kind-eyed Timothy Dalton. Gone were the flabby one-liners, the preposterous gadgets, the ubiquitous cocktails and the world-threatening schemes. This was a smaller, less ambitious Bond that somehow felt grander and more audacious, a film that grounded the series back in reality and made us believe that 007 could thrive once more in the 21st century.</p> <p><strong>Favourite gadget:</strong> Bond's in-car defibrillator, which is used to restart his heart after LeChiffre poisons him at the poker table, is a realistic essential item of kit for a modern-day spy.</p> <p><strong>Favourite line: </strong> Vesper Lynd: \"If the only thing left of you was your smile and your little finger, you'd still be more of a man than anyone I've ever known.\" Bond: \"That's because you know what I can do with my little finger ...\"</p>",

Businesses, the media and politicians arguably conspire in an \"optimism industry\" that patronises through the soft bigotry of low expectations. It is now a common trope to quote the Economist's 2000 cover \"The hopeless continent\" then compare it to the same magazine's \"Africa rising\" from 2011.</p> <p>The reality is chequered, awkward, defiant of <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/africa-next-with-investment-outpacing-aid-is-this-a-new-golden-age-for-the-poorest-continent/article4560978/?page=all\" title=\"\">two- or three-word headlines</a>.</p> <p>Africa accounts for about 2% of world GDP.

Nigeria powers on with brilliant entrepreneurs co-existing with desperate infrastructure and violent extremists seeking to impose sharia law.</p> <p>To be born female or gay in most African countries is still to be faced with a lifetime of cultural and material disadvantage.

Mobile phones make it possible for users to communicate with, and send money to, relatives in faraway villages with an ease that was once unthinkable. Combined with the internet, they also make it harder for tyrannies to bury their crimes.</p> <p>The number of major African conflicts is down from 12 in the mid-1990s to four today. Secondary school enrolment rose by 48% from 2000 to 2008. Deaths from malaria and Aids are in decline. In eight of the past 10 years, sub-Saharan Africa's economies have outpaced east Asia's. Africa has its super-rich elite, its middle-class shopping malls, its age of leisure and obsession with the English Premier League.</p> <p>But too often this growth is jobless, meaning that Africa's fast-growing young population has the makings of a demographic timebomb.

  "<p>A man who was wrongly charged with rape was the \"innocent victim of an avoidable contamination\" at a private forensics laboratory, an official report concludes.</p> <p>Adam Scott, 20 was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/mar/09/forensics-firm-investigated-dna\" title=\"\">falsely accused</a> after a plastic tray that should have been disposed of at a laboratory run by <a href=\"http://www.lgc.co.uk/divisions/lgc_forensics.aspx\" title=\"\">LGC Forensics</a> was reused in the analysis of a swab taken from the rape victim.</p> <p>Scott spent five months on remand over the Manchester attack, even though mobile phone records suggested he had been 280 miles away in Devon shortly afterwards.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/agencies-public-bodies/fsr/dna-contam-report?view=Binary\" title=\"\">report [pdf]</a> from the forensic science regulator, Andrew Rennison, concludes that a plastic tray containing a sample of Scott's DNA, which had been taken for an unrelated matter, was re-used in the analysis of a swab from the rape victim.</p> <p>Rennison said: \"The contamination was the result of human error by a technician who failed to follow basic procedures for the disposal of plastic trays.\" He said the fact that trays were reused had been identified almost two weeks before Scott was charged, and there should have been a \"more comprehensive\" response at that point.</p> <p>The regulator said 26,000 samples had been processed before the flaw was spotted, but he was satisfied there had been no further cases of contamination. The report reveals that following the rape, samples were sent to LGC, which claims to be the largest provider of forensic science services in the UK. Tests at LGC's laboratory in Teddington, Middlesex, linked the sample to Scott.</p> <p>LGC's report on the case said: \"It is estimated that the chance of obtaining matching DNA components if the DNA came from someone else unrelated to Adam Scott is approximately one in one billion.\" Scott was charged with rape in October 2011 and remained in custody until March. The regulator's report says the sole evidence against Scott was a partial DNA profile developed by LGC at Teddington.</p> <p>Rennison said: \"I am satisfied that it was his profile though not from the samples taken from the rape victim, but introduced through the incorrect re-use of disposable plastic trays during the automated DNA extraction process at LGC. Scott's saliva from an unconnected earlier processed sample had been present in one cell of a tray that was re-used, with sufficient DNA present to contaminate the later rape sample.\"</p> <p>He continued: \"The re-use of the trays was the result of human error by an unidentified laboratory technician failing to follow the LGC operating procedures. LGC internal investigations identified and acknowledged the errors and failures in the issues set out above, procedures and training have since been improved, assessed and cleared as part of a wider annual assessment of LGC by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service.\"</p> <p>LGC said it deeply regretted the incident. It said: \"The forensic regulator and the accreditation service have expressed their satisfaction with our investigation into the incident, the corrective actions and LGC's overall contamination avoidance and checking processes.\"</p>",
  "<p>News International is forecasting that it will rack up \u00a37.5m in legal costs just on internal document searches relating to civil damages claims for alleged News of the World phone hacking.</p> <p>The publisher of the now-closed Sunday tabloid revealed at a high court civil case management hearing on Monday that it had already spent \u00a31m on so-called \"disclosure searches\" of databases for emails and other internally archived documents that may be pertinent to the litigation.</p> <p>PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has been hired as a consultant, has spent a further \u00a33.5m on document searches and is forecast to spend another \u00a33m in 2013.</p> <p>Dinah Rose QC, counsel for News International, revealed the figures as she argued against further generic document disclosures on phone hacking.</p> <p>Rose criticised lawyers representing more than 170 alleged phone-hacking victims, including Cherie Blair and Neil Kinnock, accusing them of seeking to drive the search for disclosure of more information out of their own interests and not the litigants themselves.</p> <p>\"This litigation is essentially being driven by a legal team, not the concern of individuals,\" she told the court.</p> <p>Rose noted that the lawyers had an acute interest in News International because they had also acted in the Leveson inquiry.</p> <p>She was defending an application to amend a claim against the publisher in relation to News International's original position on phone hacking \u2013 that it was the work of one rogue reporter.</p> <p>Lawyers for the claimants believe that News International's denial \u2013 which it maintained for nearly four years from early 2007 \u2013 added to the hurt and distress caused and want the compensation to reflect this.</p> <p>But Rose told Mr Justice Vos, the high court judge overseeing the civil damages claims, that the difficulty was no claimant had actually pleaded this and their lawyers had no right to amend their arguments for damages.</p> <p>\"That's the source of this problem; we have here a superstructure created not because of the claims of a particular claimant, but [because of] the interests of a legal team who have been following the precise ins and outs of the Leveson inquiry,\" she said.</p> <p>Vos described News International's admissions in relation to phone hacking, surveillance and in one case email interception as among \"frankly the most amazing admissions you have seen\". But he also described some of the information the claimants were seeking as \"really rather fringe\".</p> <p>At least a dozen law firms have submitted claims for damages on behalf of alleged victims, who range from high-profile politicians to footballers such as Wayne Rooney and those linked to victims of crime such as Joanne Lees, whose boyfriend Peter Falconio was murdered in the Australian outback.</p> <p>However, all the cases are being managed by Mark Thomson, one of the lawyers who led the first batch of successful civil damages claims against News International earlier this year.</p> <p>The claimants are being represented in the high court by a team of four barristers, two of whom represented them in the Leveson inquiry, including David Sherborne.</p> <p>Last week, Rose told the court that every key word search of the entire internal communications archive within News International cost \u00a35,000 to \u00a310,000 and argued the litigation was \"incendiary\", designed to put News International on trial.</p> <p>She said civil cases against the company were not the mechanism for \"uncovering everything that happened at News International\".</p> <p>Hugh Tomlinson QC, counsel for the claimants, told the high court last week that so far News International had disclosed 12 internal emails from between 2000 and 2005.</p> <p>Concluding her argument on Monday, Rose said that standard disclosure laws did not oblige the company to hand over documents if the matters were not in dispute.</p> <p>As News International had already admitted that phone hacking had taken place in general, disclosure could not advance the claimants' case, she added.</p> <p>The claimants have also argued they are entitled to know whether phone hacking was discussed at News of the World news conferences.</p> <p>Rose said it was widely known that phone hacking had gone on and it was of \"no significance at all\" in relation to liability whether it was discussed at the paper's editorial conference.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>Britain's biggest professional body for psychotherapists has instructed members that it is unethical for them to attempt to \"convert\" gay people to being heterosexual, formalising a policy change long demanded by rights groups.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bacp.co.uk/\" title=\"\">British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy</a> has written to its near-30,000 members to inform them of the new guidelines. The <a href=\"http://www.bacp.co.uk/admin/structure/files/pdf/10302_sep_1_p2_web.pdf\" title=\"\">letter says</a> the BACP \"opposes any psychological treatment such as 'reparative' or 'conversion' therapy which is based upon the assumption that homosexuality is a mental disorder, or based on the premise that the client/patient should change his/her sexuality\". The body adds that it recognises World Health Organisation policy that says such therapies can cause severe harm to an individual's mental and physical health.</p> <p>The statement, drawn up by the board of governors, ends: \"BACP believes that socially inclusive, non-judgmental attitudes to people who identify across the diverse range of human sexualities will have positive consequences for those individuals, as well as for the wider society in which they live. There is no scientific, rational or ethical reason to treat people who identify within a range of human sexualities any differently from those who identify solely as heterosexual.\"</p> <p>Conversion therapies are mainly associated with evangelical Christian groups in the US. It was long presumed that the vast majority of UK counsellors and psychotherapists recognised that these were widely discredited. But a 2009 survey of 1,300 therapists, psychoanalysts and psychiatrists found more than 200 had attempted to change at least one patient's sexual orientation, with 55 saying they were still offering such a therapy.</p> <p>The BACP guideline change followed a case in which a devoutly Christian psychotherapist, Lesley Pilkington, was struck off the members' list for <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-exgay-files-the-bizarre-world-of-gaytostraight-conversion-1884947.html\" title=\"\">offering conversion therapy to an undercover journalist</a>. Her <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9283083/Christian-counsellors-being-closed-down-says-struck-off-gay-cure-psychotherapist.html\" title=\"\">appeal was turned down in May</a>.</p> <p>Philip Hodson, a psychotherapist and BACP spokesman, said the organisation had previously presumed its more general guidelines on equality and acting in a client's best interest would preclude members offering such therapy, but tightened up the rules after the Pilkington case.</p> <p>He said: \"To me, as a therapist, it seemed inconceivable that someone who had been trained and made accountable could act in that way. I was shocked rigid that a member was practising conversion therapy, which I thought only happened in wackier parts of America.\"</p> <p>The BACP could have acted sooner, Hodson added: \"There is an argument to say that we haven't looked at this when we might have done. Every single year we look at our basic and key messages, and I'm afraid this one did not rise to the top at this stage. We thought it was covered by other things.\"</p> <p>While Pilkington's actions emerged in early 2010 the guidelines could not be changed until her appeal was completed, Hodson said: \"You can't establish a formal position once a case is going on \u2013 you have to wait until a case is over.\"</p> <p>The other main professional body for British psychotherapists, the UK Council for Psychotherapy, <a href=\"http://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/reparative_therapy_statement.html\" title=\"\">issued similar guidance to members in early 2010</a>, shortly after the Pilkington case emerged.</p> <p>The picture is complicated further by the fact that while the BACP and UKCP have strict accreditation and ethical guidelines, under law anyone can call themselves a psychotherapist or a counsellor. In 2007 the Labour government a<a href=\"http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/aspirantgroups/psychotherapistscounsellors\" title=\"\">nnounced plans for statutory regulation of the professions</a>, which would prevent this. The idea has since been dropped by the Department for Health.</p> <p>On Monday the governor of California, Jerry Brown, signed off a law banning any \"conversion\" therapies on those aged under 18.</p>",
  "<p>An inquest jury has been shown footage of the dying moments of a 25-year-old man lying face down on a cell floor after he had been pepper-sprayed by police.</p> <p>Jacob Michael died on August 2011 after he was arrested at his home in Widnes, Cheshire. During his arrest he was sprayed with pepper spray and struck with police batons by two officers. Forty-five minutes later he was found collapsed and unresponsive, and he was later pronounced dead in hospital.</p> <p>Michael had called police complaining of having been threatened with a gun. When the police arrived he refused them access to his room and threatened them with a hammer, the jury heard.</p> <p>Warrington coroners court, sitting at a hotel in Daresbury, Cheshire, was shown footage from a police van in which Michael was taken to a station. He repeatedly says \"I'm sorry\", and his breathing is laboured as he is told to stand up while handcuffed and in leg restraints.</p> <p>As he arrives at a custody suite in Runcorn, one officer asks Michael if he will behave himself. One says: \"Stand up, mate. We're not carrying you.\" Michael groans in response. He was then carried to a cell and placed face down on the floor.</p> <p>The jurors watched footage of an officer in uniform placing a foot on the back of his left leg. Another camera records a colleague outside the cell swinging his arm as if demonstrating a baton strike. Michael can be seen moving his head, and goes still suddenly. A nurse is called and attempts are made to resuscitate him.</p> <p>Witnesses told the Cheshire coroner, Nicholas Rheinberg, that Michael had taken cocaine and had been drinking on the weekend before his death. On 22 August 2011, the day Michael died, he had arrived home just before 5pm. His father, who has since died, was at home. The property is protected by CCTV.</p> <p>The coroner said Michael told his father someone had pulled a gun on him. Michael dialled 999 and gave his address but hung up. Two officers, Orme and Higgins, were sent to the house. Michael's mother, Christine, returned home, and her son didn't answer when she knocked on his bedroom door.</p> <p>Rheinberg said Michael telephoned police \"to ask whether the individuals outside his door were indeed police officers\". The door opened slightly and there was a struggle, before the officers entered the bedroom. They said Michael threatened them with a hammer, the jury heard, and he was pepper-sprayed. Michael ran out of the house pursued by the officers. \"There was a chase. Police batons were used and Jake was arrested,\" the coroner said.</p> <p>Rheinberg referred to European human rights legislation and the vulnerability of people in custody. Authorities had a duty to protect them, he said. It was up to the jury to decide whether there were deficiencies in Michael's care when he was arrested and whether such deficiencies \"contributed to his death and failings in a general sense\".</p> <p>On Monday afternoon the jurors were taken on a site visit. The hearing continues on Tuesday.</p>",
  "<p>Here's how the majority of design projects work. A client writes a brief, clearly laying out a set of requirements for the project they are commissioning. This brief can contain: customer needs and profile, technical specifications, budgets and manufacturing recommendations, in other words all the essential ingredients of a successful design.</p> <p>The brief provides the rules to work to and then a checklist to measure your designs against at the end. The designer's job is to balance these technical, commercial, brand and customer parameters. You can exceed the brief, but certainly never under deliver. So if this is the all-powerful blueprint for successful design, why not embed sustainability in it to ensure it happens systematically?</p> <p>Here lies the first challenge of sustainable design - getting sustainability into the design process, so it is part of the normal way we design, whether through briefing or some other mechanism. The good news is that, in our experience, sustainability is now visible in client briefs. The bad news? It's not in all briefs and as of yet, is not a default consideration in design. <a href=\"http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/our-work/insight/research/design-industry-research-2010/\" title=\"\">Just 14% of designers say</a> that green issues were an important factor in them winning or delivering work for clients.</p> <p><strong>Sustainability is just good design</strong></p> <p>'Good design is sustainable design' announced the UK Design Council's strategic plan in 2008, but I believe we must go one step further, not only making sustainability part of good design, but of all design. Mike Barry from Marks &amp; Spencer echoes this in setting a target to get sustainability inside every product the retailer sells.</p> <p>My <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/sustainability-sustainable-design-products?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">previous article</a> explained how designers shape the next generation of products and services that are critical to the sustainability of the UK economy. Factoring social and environmental considerations into the design of future products can ensure we hit our long-term targets for carbon emissions, resource efficiency, waste reduction, and reduced toxicity. Historically we've targeted specific sustainable products within a portfolio (an eco-range), or <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/economy/products-consumers/\" title=\"\">high impact products</a>. This only spotlights a contradiction in a company's portfolio; why design sustainable products next to unsustainable counterparts? There are also cases of the risk impacts reduced in one product category being cancelled out by spiraling impacts in another.</p> <p><strong>100% of designs must encompass sustainability</strong></p> <p>One example of a sustainable design is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/gallery/sustainable-product-design-in-pictures?intcmp=239#/?picture=396261008&amp;index=6\" title=\"\">Bimbo packaging</a>, primarily designed for the user benefit of eliminating the ineffective packaging tie, which also has environmental benefits. Another is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/gallery/sustainable-product-design-in-pictures?intcmp=239#/?picture=396261020&amp;index=3\" title=\"\">Replenish</a>, the household cleaning refill that saves you money and reduces the inconvenience of running out.</p> <p>If sustainability in all design is the goal, then the client-designer relationship will be crucial to delivering this. Here are three ways to make sustainability a default in design:</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Design briefs</strong></p> <p>Getting the briefing process right is an obvious first step. We've seen sustainability written into briefs in such unspecific ways that it will be of little use. This risks it being sidelined or dropped off the priority list. The more specific clients are in briefing, the better the results will be.</p> <p>Many advocate<a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/economy/products-consumers/\" title=\"\"> lifecycle assessment</a> (LCA) or other product footprinting as an essential or mandatory part of design, which companies such as Levis, Danone or Kraft reportedly do. While in principle this may be effective, a broader set of sustainable design tools may be needed.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 In design processes</strong></p> <p>Individual products or projects are usually part of a strategic portfolio, which is carefully managed and can be another point of influence. Companies such as DSM, which aims for 80% of pipeline from sustainable product by 2015, and IKEA, with its goal of 90% eco-improved products by 2015, are building sustainability systematically into design. If targets are set to move the portfolio towards sustainability, the projects and products will follow.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Through design persuasion or stealth</strong></p> <p>Designers cannot control briefs or what clients do, but they can influence. That kind of creative disruption is often why clients turn to designers \u2013 because they think differently, stretching the client and the brief beyond what they see today. Why not do this on sustainability, either through persuasion or stealth?</p> <p>Given that the dynamics of power resting with clients, industry programmes and design standards can help, such as WRAP's excellent <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/economy/products-consumers/\" title=\"\">Product Sustainability Forum</a>, looking to unify the way we design products across different industries.</p> <p><strong>Next generation design</strong></p> <p>All this may sound like good housekeeping, rather than the imaginative, creative, inspirational processes normally associated with design. But even if its not glamorous, it can certainly be effective. In future, doing design without sustainability being, at the very least, a consideration in the brief or process, will be as inexcusable as designing dangerous or unsafe products is today.</p> <p>Avoiding sustainable design considerations now could also mean building-in future environmental or social risks for the very clients that designers are serving, or even for the next generation of users. That really would be 'off-brief' and the exact opposite of the added value service that clients have come to expect from good design.</p> <p><em>Chris Sherwin is head of sustainability at design and innovation company </em><a href=\"http://www.seymourpowell.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Seymourpowell</em></a><em>.

  "<p>High speed rail link notwithstanding, Paris fashion week still feels a long way from the Olympic village. After a triumphant summer of leotards and Lycra, Stella McCartney returned to her day job on Monday, parading her newest collection on a catwalk at one of her favourite venues, the Palais Garnier opera house.</p> <p>The Palais Garnier is a lavish cathedral to art, beauty and the sport of social vanity. Architect Charles Garnier pioneered the use of red and gold interiors, rather than the traditional pink and blue: it is said that he did so specifically to enhance the experience of an evening at the opera, because the colour scheme is more flattering to the complexion and a better foil for jewellery. As if to underline the Parisian and distinctly unathletic tone of the event, cafe au lait and miniature pains au chocolat were served to guests as they arrived.</p> <p>But the Olympic legacy was to make itself felt even here. First, there was the presence in the best seats of the Team GB star trio of Victoria Pendleton, Ellie Simmonds and Louis Smith, a significant post-Olympic addition to the front row roll call of the beautiful, the cool and the glamorous, led as always by Kate Moss. Second, it was noticeable that Sir Paul McCartney, who rarely misses his daughter's catwalk shows, was less besieged by photographers than usual. The great summer of London 2012 has overtaken the Beatle connection in the story of Stella's brand, it seems.</p> <p>The clothes had an ease and a freedom of movement which suggested an unwillingness to return from a summer of sport to the painstakingly constructed and narrowly defined aesthetic of catwalk beauty. The sculptured shapes of last season made way for fabrics which allowed the rippling movement of the body beneath to define the wearer's silhouette.</p> <p>For daytime, this meant micro-plisse pleating, the tiny zigzag folds of which concertina to subtly expand and contract so that the body creates the shape of the garment rather than being imprisoned by set-in-stone measurements.</p> <p>For evening, silk organza was cut on the bias, a technique which emphasises the sway and roll of the hips instead of constricting them into a wiggle. This new looseness of stride was emphasised by the shoes, which were flat or low-heeled. \"Optimistic\" was McCartney's timely word for the colours: apple green and Tropicana orange, a naive contrast to the rich, painterly blue of last season.</p> <p>But fashion being six months ahead, the Olympics is last year's news already, and McCartney dismissed the reference. The sporty references, she pointed out, are always in her collection \u2013\"that's part of who she is, the woman I dress\". Instead, she said she conceived the show as \"about conversation between a man and a woman. I wanted to capture that dialogue between the masculine and the feminine, the boldness and directness of that, and also the fragility of it.\" What this meant on the catwalk was outfits which each held within them a quirk or contradiction. Some outfits had a different pattern on the back view from that on the front. Very bold, flag-like arcs of colour were used on ultra-delicate skeins of silk rib; a fitted bustier top was worn over slouchy cropped trousers.</p> <p>Contrast is at the heart of the Stella McCartney brand. The lifestyle she sells is about glamour with a work ethic; integrity with a sense of humour; London with a splash of Paris. This was not an Olympic-influenced show, but \u2013 much better, this \u2013 a collection from a Brit with a post-Olympic spring in her step.</p> <p>But even headline-makers such as McCartney are mere sideshows this Paris fashion week. All eyes are trained now on Yves Saint Laurent, as the house prepares for the first show by new designer Hedi Slimane. Rave reviews garnered by the rival house of Dior for that label's first show by Raf Simons have increased the pressure. Interest has been piqued still further by the intense secrecy surrounding all aspects of Slimane's new look for the house.</p> <p>It was revealed last week that a new-look Yves Saint Laurent website will be unveiled a few hours after the show on Tuesday, extending Slimane's artistic control into the digital role. For now, fashion industry insiders have only one clue to study. The invitation to the show at the Grand Palais is a black notebook, each page of which is printed with a different close-up image of leopard print fabric.</p>",

The Lighthouse on Shivering Sands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While many other Yorkshire writers have enjoyed continuing popularity - think of Charlotte Bronte and her sisters or JB Priestley - Fletcher has rather faded from public consciousness. Indeed, on being asked to write this piece, this outpost of the <em>Northerner</em> believed that she had never previously heard of him, until she chanced on a battered copy of his <em>Nooks and Corners of Yorkshire</em> while dusting the bookshelves, itself a rare event... </p> <p>In the pages relating to my own home of the Calder Valley, Fletcher writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In places like Ripponden, Mytholmroyd and Barkisland, any discerning traveller will see things which he will not find elsewhere in England</p> </blockquote> <p><br>although annoyingly, he does not state what these things might be, going straight on to discuss the <a href=\"http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/halifax_gibbet.htm\">Halifax Gibbet</a>, and not returning to the villages. He does, however, give a helpful list of inns and hotels nearby; the two listed for Halifax, the White Swan and the Old Cock, are still there.</p> <p>Fletcher was an immensely fast and prolific writer, which may be why he forgot to go back to the Calderdale curiosities. He wrote 237 books, more than any other Yorkshire person ever, which leaves me, as a fellow writer, exhausted simply thinking about it. His <em>oeuvre </em>spanned fiction, history, dialect and poetry. </p> <p>Born in 1863, the son of a clergyman who died when his son was only eight months old, Joseph Smith Fletcher went on to become one of the leading exponents of crime-writing's <a href=\"http://www.classiccrimefiction.com/goldenage.htm\">'Golden Age'.</a> Among his creations was the clerical detective Rev. Francis Leggatt, vicar of Meddersley, a place described in shorthand familiar today as being located 'away in the North.' Another creation was private investigator Ronald Camberwell, who features in several of Fletcher's books. </p> <p>Loyally, <a href=\"http://www.calderdale.gov.uk/leisure/libraries/index.html\">Calderdale libraries</a> still hold 131 of his titles, among them such enticing works as <em>Cobweb Castle</em> and <em>Dead Men's Money</em>, each one taking only a few weeks to polish off. Thanks in part to <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/woodrowwilson\">President Woodrow Wilson</a>'s admiration for his work, especially his best-known title <em>Murder in the Middle Temple</em>, Fletcher became better known in the United States than in Britain.</p> <p>Originally a student of law, Fletcher switched to journalism for its greater excitement and worked on the <em>Leeds Mercury</em> and the <em>Yorkshire Post</em>. His wholly inappropriate byline for an urban child who continued to live and work in cities was 'Son of the Soil'. His plots often revolve around clever swindles, rather than murder, and he is quoted as saying:</p> <blockquote> <p>I believe I got my interest in criminology right from the fact that a famous case of fraud was heard at the Quarter Sessions at a town where I was at school - its circumstances were unusual and mysterious and the truth hard to get at; oddly enough, I have never yet used this as the basis of a story. <br>Then, when I left school, I meant to be a barrister and I read criminal law and attended a great many queer trials for some time. But turning to journalism instead, I knew of a great many queer cases on famous murder trials. Also, I learnt a good deal about criminology in conversations with the late <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/ACirving.htm\">HB Irving </a>the famous actor, who was an expert.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396975246\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/1/1349104808299/mermaid.jpg\" alt=\"fletcher\" width=\"140\" height=\"105\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fletcher knew the importance of a romantic element, even in haunted lighthouses up north.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another of his singular traits was creating a setting for his financial whodunnits which comprised a bank with bedrooms attached which helped the plots to rattle entertainingly along. Such arrangements were not uncommon in northern cities, where bankers and accountants liked to stay close to their work during times of crisis or major audit or not infrequently didn't just stay late at the office, but slept there.</p> <p>Fletcher married the Irish writer, Rosamond Grant Langbridge, with whom he had a son. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society, and died in 1935. It is time for a revival of interest in his work and perhaps North Country Theatre's choice of play will get that under way.</p> <p><strong>Michael Nunn</strong>, who reviews plays at Lancaster for the <em>Northerner </em>from time to time, adds: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was delighted to see your kind mention of my relative by marriage Joseph Smith Fletcher. His son, Rev Valentine Fletcher, married my late father's cousin, Phyllis Muriel (Mary) Hinckley, the daughter of a Birmingham schoolmaster, Arthur Hinckley MC MSc. The Hinckleys, including my grandmother Emily Jane, were originally from Altofts and Normanton, West Riding. <br> Mary Fletcher went to Oxford in the 1920s and worked as a teacher and examiner. Valentine himself was at Oriel, Oxford, and served as an Anglican priest in Elland, Bradford, Duxford in Cambridgeshire, Dundee Cathedral and Littlemore in Oxfordshire. He published a monograph, <em>Newman's Oxford</em>, in the 1970s.<br> I am of course delighted (not least as a mere journalist but as one who's just had a newly-devised evening of rehearsed readings performed in Lancaster's Grand Theatre) that JSF's work is being reappraised and indeed performed. He certainly was a leading figure in early C20 detective fiction, owing not a little to Dickens and Conan Doyle. He also published guidebooks to his beloved North, including historical city guides to Leeds and Sheffield. Since a recent downsizing move I've given my Fletcher collection to our local Oxfam Bookshop, but I'm sure there are still plenty of his works available if one looks in <a href=\"http://www.detective-fiction.com/js-fletcher.htm\">the right places</a>.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<h2>PENALTY SPOTS</h2> <p>Sergio Aguero is known for many things: being Diego Maradona's son-in-law, glorying in the nickname Kun and being producer of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1699231/\" title=\"\">Quarantine 2: Terminal</a>, the poster of which features a terrified looking female passenger being scared in an aeroplane with preposterously large windows*. Unlike some of his footballing brethren, one thing Sergio Aguero is not renowned for is being a whining, moaning, prissy malcontent who's always grumbling about perceived injustices. So when Manchester City's vastly experienced Argentinian striker feels compelled to politely make an observation on the state of the game, the Fiver feels similarly moved to listen.</p> <p>In the wake of Manchester City's late win against Fulham, Aguero suggested that, when it comes to the awarding of penalties, foreigners tend to get treated more strictly by referees than home-grown players in countries all over the world and that leagues in the UK are no exception. \"It happens everywhere,\" he said. \"There is a little bit of privilege with players who come from that country, but that is normal. We just play our game, and the referee's job is to know who is tricking him and who is not.\"</p> <p>Aguero's comments came in the wake of a match in which his Argentinian compatriot Carlos Tevez was denied an obvious penalty after being floored in the Fulham penalty area, while his team-mate Pablo Zabaleta also had a half-decent appeal for a spot-kick rejected. Sadly, Aguero's argument was somewhat undermined by the fact that the one penalty awarded in the match went to Fulham's John Arne Riise, who despite being as Norwegian as Vikings, lutefisk and raucous black metal tunesmiths Gorgoroth, still managed to gull referee Mark Halsey with a preposterously theatrical triple axle with pike. Still, with his ginger hair and pasty complexion, it's hardly inconceivable that the official mistook him for a Brit.</p> <p>Meanwhile at Carrow Road, Brendan Rodgers celebrated his side's shellacking of Norwich City to voice his own concerns about the non-awarding of penalties to Luis Suarez, from Uruguay, whose reputation for diving he fears is influencing match officials. \"There is that fear,\" he said. \"There are players, attacking players who go down at times. I can't worry too much about it. It's something that hopefully the referees, when they assess and analyse their own performance, they have to look at it \u2026 and hopefully those penalties that we don't get won't come back to haunt us.\"</p> <p>A smart man, there's every possibility that Rodgers is flagging up the issue in a bid to sow a seed in the minds of referees and influence them in his own little way. As methods of winning penalties go it's certainly more discreet than that of his wily striker, but only time will tell if it yields better results.</p> <p>* May be a different Sergio Aguero.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"I am against diving, absolutely. It's something we should eradicate from the game. It's probably not easy but if there's anything that can be done then we are for it\" - Wise words from Roberto Di Matteo.

  "<p>In one of his first decrees since settling behind his new desk this morning, the new chief executive of <strong>AstraZeneca</strong>, Pascal Soriot, has said the drugs firm will stop its share buyback programme half way through.</p> <p>The company had repurchased \u00a31.4bn in shares this year, but had been expected to spend \u00a32.8bn before Soriot put a stop to the practice.</p> <p>He said:</p> <blockquote> As I assume my new responsibilities at AstraZeneca, I believe this is a prudent step that maintains flexibility while the board and I complete the company's ongoing annual strategy update. </blockquote> <p>The announcement caused a minor backlash on the shareprice, dropping 32p, 1.1%, at \u00a329.22 (the biggest faller this afternoon and one of only six companies to lose value in the FTSE 100).</p> <p>His decision comes on the day he takes over from former chief executive David Brennan, who <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/apr/26/astrazeneca-boss-quits-boardroom-coup\" title=\"\">stepped down after setbacks in drug research and under pressure from shareholders.</a></p> <p>Brennan's focus in the last five years had been on paying dividends and buying back shares in the hope of creating higher returns for investors.</p> <p>In the past shareholders have complained when companies opt to buyback shares, claiming it leaves the price artificially high, although the shareprice reaction appears fairly muted.</p> <p>Brennan was arguably burnt by AstraZenca's purchase of <strong>MedImmune</strong> in 2007 for $15.2bn at the height of the boom and subsequently criticised for being too high.</p> <p>The change of direction by Soriot could lead to a resumption of major acquisitions by the firm, although this won't be known until the end of an annual review due to be revealed in January.</p> <p>Brian Bourdot, an analyst at Barclays, told Bloomberg:</p> <blockquote> It's a bit of a surprise that they changed course mid- year, but a new chief executive likes to take control and see what the options are. <br>It would increase their ability to do a deal, that's something we have to bear in mind. </blockquote>",
  "<p>In the 1990s, the Pet Shop Boys <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfGTm_viXPs\" title=\"\">urged everyone to go west</a>, but these days, for UK international law firms, the opposite direction of travel is more attractive.</p> <p>The increased globalisation of trade and state of the world economy means UK law firms are going east in search of clients and revenue.</p> <p>On Monday, Herbert Smith, or Herbies as the city law firm is affectionately known, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/herbert-smith-in-tieup-to-form-new-legal-giant-8191539.html\" title=\"\">merges with Australian firm Freehills</a>. Herbert Smith Freehills comprises 20 worldwide offices with 2,800 lawyers. The union will form the eighth largest law firm in the world and the largest law firm in Asia Pacific \u2014 one of the fastest growing legal markets in the world.</p> <p>So, if you see yourself working on multi-jurisdictional corporate deals, energy projects or international arbitrations in the region how might you persuade firms such as Herbert Smith Freehills that you're the right person for the job? \"As well as being an absolutely first rate lawyer, you need a sort of cultural affinity. You've got to enjoy working with people from different cultural backgrounds,\" says David Willis, managing partner at the firm.</p> <p>Applicants with international backgrounds who have lived in the region and have knowledge of the cultures and languages, and who have been educated to the same standard as students in the UK will, naturally, be attractive to the firm says Willis. But that does not rule out home grown students who do not have that background. What you do need, he suggests, is an international outlook.</p> <p>There's no two ways about it, you will face stiff competition if you want to work at a world-class law firm. Herbert Smith received more than 2,000 applications for the 70 \u2014 80 training contracts it offered in previous years.</p> <p>It is essential to shine, both academically and through extra-curricular activities. The firm says that whether you attended a state school or were privately educated should not matter, provided that you get the right grades, though it has no data on the educational background of its current trainees. Herbies requires a minimum of AAB at A-level for application to its vacation placements or for a training contract, and most candidates have straight As.</p> <p>The firm demands at least a 2:1 degree, but whether that is in law or in another subject does not matter. Generally around two thirds of those looking to become lawyers have a law degree, while the other third have studied another subject. \"I wouldn't know whether a lawyer working for me has done a law degree or something else and I don't really mind, provided it is a rigorous degree that teaches analytical skills,\" says Willis. What is important, he says, is that students have developed the ability to \"take great mounds of material and distil it down to coherent principles.\"</p> <p>If you haven't studied languages, it will not jeopardise your chances but, suggests Willis, applicants will have to demonstrate and show tangible evidence that they are internationally minded. What you have done with any gap year will be of interest.</p> <p>Willis is keen to point out that while the firm demands the highest academic standards, that does not mean that students must have attended Oxbridge: it recruits from a range of universities, although 36% of its 158 current trainees are Oxbridge graduates.</p> <p>To show what it would be like to be a trainee at the firm, Herbert Smith offers vacation schemes at its London and other international offices. Done in the penultimate or final year at university, or after graduation, students sit with a partner or associate and are given work to do for clients, as well as taking part in workshops and presentations and attending social events. Vacation students are paid \u00a3350 a week.</p> <p>Applications are open for the winter scheme from 1 \u2013 31 October and for the summer schemes from 1 December \u2013 15 January. If you spent your gap year in east Asia, you could consider applying to do a vacation placement at the firm's Hong Kong office.</p> <p>Those who have not done studied law at undergraduate level must undertake the year long graduate diploma in law. The next stage on the journey to becoming a lawyer, for all students, is the legal practice course (LPC). Herbert Smith took the decision to move away from the generic LPC and, with four other leading City firms, created a bespoke course designed to prepare for life in a city law firm.</p> <p>Run by BPP Law School, the course focuses on learning how to handle corporate and finance transactions, real estate transactions, and commercial dispute resolution matters \u2013 the firm's core practice areas. Willis accepts that the move may be seen as elitist, but defends the firm's position:</p> <blockquote> \"The trouble is that if you go to law school and you're trained how to do family law, conveyancing and criminal law, we don't do those things. We need to focus on civil litigation and company law, on business law.\" </blockquote> <p>The selection process for those elusive training contracts is rigorous. Candidates are put through a situational judgment test, a verbal and logical reasoning test, and an assessment day during which they undertake a range of exercises.</p> <p>In common with many large firms, the split between the number of male and female trainees is almost even \u2013 45% of the current cohort are men and 55% are women. But that shifts as careers progress. By associate level, the ratio is 48% male to 52% female. By partnership level the ration is distorted, with 83% male and only 17% female.</p> <p>During the training contract, which is split into four six-month slots, most recruits spend time working in-house with a client or in an international office. Willis recommends that anyone looking to work in Asia Pacific should get out to one of the region's offices during their training contract.</p> <p>After that, he advises junior lawyers to be open-minded about where their career takes them. When it comes to promotion criteria, he says working overseas will not harm your chances. In fact the position is quite the reverse.

  "<p>The headline grabber in the government's latest round of planning reform called for the affordable housing element of section 106 agreements to be cut where the requirement made new development unviable. Evidence suggests that the introduction of the community infrastructure levy (CIL) is already reducing the number of new affordable homes and as more councils adopt CIL the situation is likely to deteriorate.</p> <p>CIL was designed by the last Labour government, initially opposed by the Conservatives with promises to scrap it when in power, and then introduced by the coalition government. The logic for the levy is that the cost of new physical and social infrastructure necessary to support development is calculated across a whole authority and then worked back to a per square metre figure for any new development. As it is levied on a much wider range of developments it spreads the cost of funding infrastructure; it allows developers to calculate at the outset of a project exactly what costs they will incur rather than negotiating complicated section 106 agreements on a site-by-site basis at the end of the planning process.</p> <p>So surely knowing what the costs are up front is a good thing? Yes: ultimately, CIL will help clarify whether new schemes are viable more easily. But there are real concerns about the level of charges being levied (which are much higher than previous section 106 payments) and the time it takes for increased costs to filter down into land values. As costs go up and viability goes down, something has to give \u2013 and that is usually affordable housing.</p> <p>The position has been further exaggerated in London \u2013 the one area where higher values should overcome additional costs \u2013 by the introduction of a CIL by mayor Boris Johnson to help meet a \u00a3300m shortfall in funding of his Crossrail project. With charges of between \u00a320 and \u00a350 per square metre, this falls on top of a local authority's own section 106 requirements and any local CIL that the borough may have adopted.</p> <p>Developers are unlikely to add these additional costs to house prices, because they won't sell in today's difficult housing market. Land vendors are long gone, so prices cannot be renegotiated once the levy is imposed.</p> <p>CIL is designed to be non-negotiable: no CIL, no planning permission. A developer assessing viability has to prioritise CIL above any variable or negotiable costs to the proposed scheme, which brings us back to affordable housing. The developer either halts the scheme or reduces the amount of affordable housing. The council has received its CIL payment but has approved less affordable housing \u2013 or, at worst, no new housing at all.</p> <p>CIL can be used to fund infrastructure anywhere in an authority, further weakening the relationship between local communities and the impacts and benefits of new development. It undermines the understanding that building new housing without the necessary physical and social infrastructure flouts the basic principles of sustainable development.</p> <p>We are entering the realm of unintended consequences; a community infrastructure levy which acutally reduces the provision of local infrastructure and badly needed new housing.</p> <p><em>Ian Blacker is chair and head of planning advisory services at </em><a href=\"http://www.jrp.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>John Rowan and Partners</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and the </strong><a href=\"http://localgovernmentjobs.theguardian.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>latest job vacancies</strong></a><strong> direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>In the foothills of Hampstead Heath, where Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels used to take their afternoon strolls, stands the home of Eric and Marlene Hobsbawm. To enter the Nassington Road drawing room for a conversation with Hobsbawm was to be transported back to the great ideological struggles of the extreme 20th century. Here was where ideas mattered, history had a purpose, and politics was important. And one could have no more generous, humane, rigorous, and involved a guide than the late Eric Hobsbawm.</p> <p>The breadth of his work and the reach of his intellect was always startling. Right to the end of his days, he stayed up to date with scholarship, never failed to flay an opponent, and continued to write. Afternoon tea with Hobsbawm could range from the achievements of President Lula of Brazil to the limitations of Isaiah Berlin as an historian, the unfortunate collapse of the Communist party in West Bengal to what Ralph Miliband would have made of his boys, David and Ed.</p> <p>But his lifetime's achievement was to transform the study of history in Britain. He was part of a postwar generation that rescued the subject from parochialism and dry-as-dust empiricism to shed new light on the past \u2013 from the history of social protest to the invention of tradition and the impact of jazz.</p> <p>For Hobsbawm, history had to be part of the conversation of the present. He fitted well into the English historical tradition of writing popular history books for an educated public. He was part of the practice of historical writing stretching back to Thomas Babington Macaulay and GM Trevelyan, alongside his peers AJP Taylor and Hugh Trevor-Roper. His 19th-century series on industry and empire and his bestselling account of the 20th-century provided the kind of global history for a broad readership few scholars have been able to match.</p> <p>His most important contribution was to open up the study of class and economy within the British academy. His membership of the Communist party historians group and his involvement with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annales_School\" title=\"\">French Annales school of historians</a> led him to emphasise the role of social history and structure in any comprehensive account of the past. Social history, for Hobsbawm, had to be part of the broader political project of the left \u2013 bringing to life lost voices and placing the lived reality of the people centre stage. But Hobsbawm was never a crass materialist \u2013 he always believed in the importance of the history of ideas. None more so than Marxism.</p> <p>Hobsbawm was one of Marxism's finest scholars. On day one, week one of any course I teach on Marxism, I give the students Hobsbawm to read. He explained its intellectual origins, historical function and 20th-century failings like few others. Of course, he was a believer \u2013 writing at the end of his life that \"the supersession of capitalism still sounds plausible to me\". And the recent crisis of capitalism only gave his ideological commitment more fervency. As he told me in one of his final interviews, \"a different combination, a different mix of state action and control and freedom would have to be worked out&#xa0;\u2026 It may well no longer be capitalism, certainly not in the sense in which we have known it in this country and the United States\".</p> <p>When it came to his own continued membership of the Communist party after the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary, Hobsbawm refused to play the apologist game. As a historian, he demanded to be understood in his own context \u2013 someone whose political identity was forged in the 1930s when the struggle against fascism took place on the streets of Vienna and the Communists were on the right side of history. He never sought, as he put it, \"agreement, approval or sympathy\". It was part of who he was and that was that.</p> <p>If all of this makes him sound a dour, Marxist professor then it could not be further from the truth. He loved to talk politics and academic wrangling over a vodka and tonic; he enjoyed a good book launch; he was an adept performer at history festivals (after a nip of whisky); and revelled in his large and adoring family.</p> <p>I last saw Hobsbawm at a lunch organised for himself and Hugh Thomas, the great scholar of Spain, at the House of Commons. There he expressed his great affection for Britain for adopting him in the 1930s, reflected with brio on the general correctness of his lifetime's historical work, and affirmed his conviction in a \"proper\" understanding of the past. Over coffee, Ed Miliband came to pay his regards and in the mix of history and politics, an appreciation of the past in the actions of the present, there was an affirmation of Hobsbawm's work.</p> <p>But, Hobsbawm being Hobsbawm, he immediately complained that Ed wasn't being nearly radical enough. There was always more work to be done, more criticism needed, more understanding shared. Hobsbawm was an Enlightenment giant whose passing marks a sad pulling away from the 20th century and all it entailed.</p> <p>\u2022 Tristram Hunt is the Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central.

  "<p>Hundreds of failed asylum seekers are living in Scotland on less than the UN's global poverty target of 77 pence ($1.25) a day.</p> <p>Pregnant women, children and people with disabilities are among those who have been left destitute on Scotland's streets, according to a <a href=\"http://www.stopdestitution.org.uk/files/Trapped%20destitution%20and%20asylum%20final.pdf\" title=\"\">report by the Scottish Poverty Information Unit (pdf)</a> which is based at Glasgow Caledonian University. The UN benchmark is aimed primarily at raising incomes in developing countries.</p> <p>The report's author, Morag Gillespie of SPIU, said the levels of poverty she found were \"dreadful\" and that many interviewees were literally penniless with no legitimate means of income.</p> <p>She said: \"I am an experienced researcher in the field of poverty but I was shocked at the scale of the problem and the accounts I heard: people literally trying to work out where the next meal would come from; a person forced to sleep in a church cupboard. This is a hidden crisis. I was upset at what I found and as a UK citizen I am affronted that the government allows this to happen.\"</p> <p>The report states that 1,849 destitute people were given emergency grants from a charity called the Refugee Survival Trust from 2009 to 2012.</p> <p>The recipients were mostly male (76%) but included 128 families with children, 21 pregnant women and 25 new mothers.</p> <p>Almost half (49%) were homeless, including families with children, 26 people with mental health issues, four disabled people and five pregnant women and two new mothers. The asylum seekers came from 67 countries, most often Iran, Iraq and Eritrea. Some interviewees had been in the asylum system for more than a decade.</p> <p>The independent study was commissioned by the British Red Cross, Refugee Survival Trust and the Scottish Refugee Council.</p> <p>SPIU recommends urgent changes to the asylum system, including support for pregnant women and measures to help the homeless and organisations supporting them.</p> <p>The report says the United Kingdom Border Agency (UKBA) should allow asylum claims to be submitted in Scotland and that \"end-to-end support\" \u2013 including accommodation and a system of cash payments \u2013 should be given to people through all stages of the asylum system until they are either granted status or leave the UK. The report also called for asylum seekers to be given the right to work if they remain in the UK for six months or more.</p> <p>Gary Christie, of the Scottish Refugee Council, said: \"Every day our case workers deal with people who are in desperate situations. We see people who have been tortured in Iran yet have been refused protection; others fleeing for their lives from the violence of war in Somalia but who don't meet the terms of the refugee convention or pregnant women whose cases have been turned down and don't qualify for any support until they reach 32 weeks. While families are supposed to receive support until they leave or are granted status, our research shows that, terrifyingly, some are falling through the gaps. The system is complex, difficult to understand and is not working.\"</p> <p>A UK Border Agency spokesperson said: \"Failed asylum seekers need not face destitution if they simply comply with the law and the decisions of our courts and go home. There are routes of return home for all the nationalities once their asylum claims have been refused and the courts have confirmed that they have no need for protection and no legal right to stay in the UK.</p> <p>\"Assisted Return schemes exist to help failed asylum seekers return home with support to help them re-integrate. Further help and advice on Return programmes can be readily obtained from the charity Refugee Action, [&#xa0;\u2026which] work[s] in partnership with the UK Border Agency to help such individuals return home.\"</p> <h2>Case study: Michael</h2> <p>A businessman from Zimbabwe, Michael had his own successful import/export business. His cousin was the chairman of the local Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) branch, at the time, the only political party in opposition to Mugabe's government. While in the UK on business Michael received a phonecall from his secretary. The office had been ransacked and his life was under threat. She told him he could never come back. His claim for asylum in the UK, however, was refused and he has been destitute for almost two years.</p> <p>After his case was refused, Michael stayed with friends \u2013 sleeping on people's sofas. Over the last few months, however, Michael has been unable to stay at his friend's any longer and has been sleeping on the floor of a church hall, which operates as an emergency night shelter.</p> <p>\"It is difficult to sleep there. There are no showers, and the food is not always good.\"</p> <p>He worries about the fact that it is what supermarkets are throwing away \u2013 often food that has gone off. He gets his clothes from charity shops but is always looking out for things people are finished with. He tries to look good to maintain his self respect and to keep his esteem up.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Why did you decide to start an environmental project?</strong></h2> <p>I have always had an interest in sustainability and eco-design as a design and technology teacher and was looking for something whole school to work on. As head of creative arts and technology, I thought that I should be encouraging students to get involved with a big project that would also help them develop leadership skills to help them have the opportunity to achieve leadership qualifications through a school based reward programme.</p> <h2><strong>How have the students got involved?</strong></h2> <p>I decided to ask students to volunteer to be part of the school's eco-committee and after putting up posters and getting messages out in assemblies and tutor time I had a small group of interested pupils from year 7 to year 12.</p> <p>One of the main events that we ran was the Switch Off Fortnight last November when everyone was encouraged to switch off machines rather than leave them on stand-by. The feedback was that a number of students and staff had changed the habits of leaving equipment such as computers, laptops and lights on stand-by in school.</p> <h2><strong>What kind of things have you been doing?</strong></h2> <p>Once the committee was formed we focused on initiatives like Switch Off Fortnight and Waste Week to get us started. As we move on to action planning for our <a href=\"http://www.keepbritaintidy.org/ecoschools/applyforanaward/silveraward\">silver award</a> - as part of the <a href=\"http://keepbritaintidy.org/EcoSchools?gclid=CN_73MXG6bICFUXHtAodVE8A4w\">Eco Schools</a> initiative - from the students decided that the areas we would focus on would be energy, school grounds, waste and global citizenship.</p> <p>The committee has two students from each year group and the action plan identified which students were responsible to lead on which areas. This helped me to manage the workload of the project and made sure that the students were running it alongside me.</p> <p>We have looked at energy monitoring and compared the impact of Switch Off Fortnight to other times in the year. We also took part in an <a href=\"http://www.etwinning.net/en/pub/index.htm\">eTwinning</a> project with 10 other European countries and focused on climate change. Students produced documents and presentations and uploaded resources to share with the schools in the cluster.</p> <p>Our waste officers have started looking at increasing the materials recycled in school and set up a waste team to make sure bins are labelled correctly and emptied regularly. Students ran assemblies, designed publicity materials to be shown on PC background screens around school and discussed waste and recycling with other students around school. The waste officers now have a recycling team who collect the paper recycling for the whole of school every week.</p> <p>We have also worked with the local community to plant trees and look at our own school grounds.</p> <p>Now, we have just started work on our action plan for the Green Flag Award and I want to encourage the student committee to run more independently this year. In our first meeting we voted for a chair and vice-chair who I will support to start with to run the meeting and organise the activities planned. I hope the two sixth form students who have taken on this extra responsibility will benefit from the skills gained to help them when they are applying for university or employment during the next year.</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>What has it taught you as a teacher?</strong></h2> <p>I've been extremely proud of the students of how hard they have worked and how reliable and organised they can be when given the opportunity. Projects like this, when the students run them, show you just how well they can work independently and maturely. In my teaching I try to encourage resilience and independence and this has just reinforced my beliefs in how important it can be to give students a whole range of experiences and opportunities for responsibilities to let them show what they are made of.</p> <h2><strong>What advice would you offer any other school embarking on a similar route?</strong></h2> <p>I would recommend making sure your students run any project with you. There is a lot of work and it is important that students do the majority. Make it fun for them as well as you, but make meetings professional so they realise how important it is. Students like badges - our waste officers wear their badges with pride and we have a colours reward system at Arden and to thank them for the commitment they all were awarded a half colour in the end of year awards ceremony to sew on to their blazer and show off to everyone.</p> <p><em>Liz Allton is the head of creative arts and technology at <a href=\"http://www.arden.solihull.sch.uk/ad/home/\">Arden Academy</a>, Solihull.</em></p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>Things seemed grim, last fall, for John Brandoli, a US citizen in Massachusetts, and his Trinidadian husband, Michael. Though their marriage was recognized by the state, it did not come with the benefit they most urgently needed. Because of the federal <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_Marriage_Act\">Defense of Marriage Act (Doma)</a>, John could not sponsor Michael for a green card.</p> <p>As a result, Michael was facing deportation to Trinidad, one of the most dangerous places in the hemisphere for gay people. Michael's American husband and mother-in-law were very anxious when they called my organization, Immigration Equality, for help. Our team \u2013 which talks to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender immigrants every day \u2013 mounted a media and advocacy campaign to stop Michael's deportation. Thanks to his determined family, and the support of Senator John Kerry, he won.</p> <p>In August 2011, the Obama administration had announced that couples like Michael and John shouldn't have to pull out all the stops to stay together. The administration pledged to review pending deportation cases and grant \"prosecutorial discretion\" to those who had committed no crime and could show equities like ties to an American family. When the administration described the plan on phone calls with press, advocacy groups, and congressional staffers, <a href=\"http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/28/14140024-us-immigration-chief-same-sex-ties-are-family-ties?lite\">they stated clearly</a>: \"We consider LGBT families to be families in this context.\"<br>This was a watershed. The American immigration system had <em>never</em> considered LGBT families like John and Michael to be families in any context. Until 1990, LGBT foreigners could be barred from entering the US entirely. America's immigration system is based on family unification, but gay families don't count.</p> <p>Bitterly, many gay immigrants feared even revealing their relationship with a US citizen. If they did, it could be used against them by immigration officials as evidence they planned to overstay a visa. (Ironically, a genuine commitment is precisely what a straight couple needs to show to be granted a green card based on their relationship.) If an LGBT immigrant does overstay, they fall into a netherworld in which getting a paycheck or opening a bank account becomes impossible. An undocumented person is at risk of being arrested, even if her only crime is staying with the person she loves.</p> <p>After years of hiding, how would someone who qualified for prosecutorial discretion know they <em>should</em> tell the government about their family? How would they prove their relationship if living in one of the 44 US states that forbids gay couples to marry, or one of the 31 that doesn't even offer domestic partnership?</p> <p>Immigration Equality's lawyers heard these questions from all over the country. We heard from couples whose lawyers didn't know to say they were gay. We heard from others who asked for discretion, only to be told by officials that no gay-inclusive policy existed. John and Michael's initial request for discretion was denied, even though Michael met all the criteria.</p> <p>So, we pressed the administration to put its promise in writing.</p> <p>A month after the initial announcement, House minority leader Nancy Pelosi, Congressman Jerry Nadler of New York, and 67 other members of Congress wrote to department of homeland security (DHS) secretary Janet Napolitano to ask for written guidelines, on the grounds that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Without specific guidance, it is unlikely that [those] making decisions about individual cases will be aware that LGBT family ties are a factor for consideration.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>When DHS issued written guidance, it did not mention LGBT families, and Napolitano's written response to the members' letter was vague. This summer an even larger group of lawmakers wrote to Napolitano again, saying:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It would be beyond senseless to see LGBT persons with family ties here in the United States deported simply because the affected persons, their attorneys, and/or ICE officials were unaware of DHS's verbal policy.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>On Thursday, Napolitano replied:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I have directed <a href=\"http://www.ice.gov/\">ICE</a> to disseminate written guidance to the field that \u2026 'family relationships' includes long-term, same-sex partners.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Her move is an immediate help to LGBT people who are undocumented. It is the first time the immigration system will categorically recognize an American citizen's relationship with an immigrant as a positive factor in an immigration case.</p> <p>However, we are still a long way from equal access to green cards and other immigration benefits. There are several solutions to this problem, including repeal of Doma and passage of pending legislation that would equalize US immigration law.</p> <p>In the meanwhile, the administration could stop denying green card applications from married gay and lesbian couples, and instead, just put them on hold until the pending lawsuits that challenge Doma are decided by the US supreme court, likely by June. Until then, LGBT couples now have some protection because of Napolitano's directive. It's an important first step.</p>",
  "<p>Time was running out when David Villa did what David Villa does. It was the 94th minute and almost midnight when he picked the ball up on the edge of the area, played a one-two with Lionel Messi, stepped beyond Emir Spahic and, taking the ball on the bounce, thumped it past Andr\u00e9s Palop. It is almost a year since he broke his leg in Japan, he missed Euro 2012, and he still hasn't completed a game, but he \"completed\" this one. It took him 10 minutes to score on his return for Spain and seven minutes to score on his return for Barcelona. In 116 minutes for his club, he's taken five shots, four of them on target, and he has scored three goals.</p> <p>This was the biggest of them all, the one that really mattered. A week after <em>that</em> discussion with Messi, Villa completed the comeback, getting the goal that closed the game of the season so far. 1-0 down after 26 minutes, 2-0 down after 48, in the 88th Barcelona were trailing Sevilla 2-1. It had taken M\u00edchel six games as a coach to beat Real Madrid; in his sixth against Barcelona he was about to beat them too. Sevilla were heading into joint second place and deservedly so, a force once more. Barcelona were going the same way as Madrid: home. Pointless. Five wins from five, their first defeat of the season closed in.</p> <p>Six minutes later, it was six from six. Barcelona won 3-2. F\u00e1bregas, 2-2. Villa, 3-2. Villa raced to the corner. His team-mates raced after him, leaping on top. \"\u00a1Epico!\" screamed the cover of El Mundo Deportivo. Elsewhere, they were screaming blue murder.</p> <p>From two points to 11 points; from game on to game over. It doesn't work like that of course but you could be forgiven for thinking that it does. And, carefully totting up points that haven't even been played for yet, that was the way many greeted it. Lose and Barcelona would be within a defeat in next Sunday's Cl\u00e1sico of seeing their lead at the top reduced to just two points; win and Barcelona would be within a victory in next Sunday's Cl\u00e1sico of seeing their lead at the top extended to 11 points. Meanwhile, Madrid would face Deportivo under pressure. Sport's cover described it as \"a morale blow for Real Madrid!\" This was the \"comeback of champions\".</p> <p>It was one of those games where it all happened so fast that you were begging the TV director to just leave well alone. Every time he stuck a replay on, he missed something. The trouble was, sticking on pointless replays is what TV directors in Spain do. Besides, he had so much to replay. The pitch was like a bowling lane, the ball skidding round so fast you could barely see it. The only thing quicker were Sevilla's players. Ping, ping, ping, crash. No time to draw breath. Barcelona's perfect start to the season had disguised the fact that their start to the season was far from perfect: now, they were swift and precise, the ball moved fast. This was Barcelona at their best. Sevilla were too. Two teams slugging it out. The way it's supposed to be.</p> <p>The sense of breathlessness was increased by a referee with no breath. For 45 minutes Mateu Lahoz, whose surname handily translates as scythe, blew what he normally blows: nothing. Lahoz is Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's favourite referee because he lets the game flow. Even if there are fouls. Twice he happily waved play on as Barcelona players came crashing down on the edge of the area. Midway through the first half he had blown just four times; it took over an hour for him to give a foul against Barcelona. And so the game got faster and faster and faster. And then Sevilla scored.</p> <p>Dani Alves invited Petr Trochowski to shoot, so he did. The man who got the winner against Real Madrid scored the opening goal, becoming only the second German ever to score against both Madrid and Barcelona. The first was Bernd Schuster. And, at the start of the second half Alvaro Negredo made it 2-0, dashing through to produce a lovely dink over Vald\u00e9s. It took four minutes for Cesc F\u00e1bregas to make it 2-1 from the edge of the area. It took another 35 for him to score the equaliser and another six for Villa to get the winner. \"I feel bitter over the result,\" M\u00edchel said, \"because we were excellent.\" He was right.</p> <p>Sevilla-Barcelona was a <em>partidazo</em>, with fascinating sub-plots all over the pitch. All five goals were expertly taken. Alex Song was playing at centre-back but nobody appeared to have told him. Every time you looked up he was standing somewhere he shouldn't be. Every time you looked up, Hedwiges Maduro on the other hand was standing where he should: the Dutchman has given Sevilla solidity and sense in the middle. Bot\u00eda and Spahic look like proper centre-backs. Ivan Rakitic is flying. Alvaro Negredo is in Good Negredo mode: he admitted that the atmosphere in Sevilla's dressing room has changed for the better. M\u00edchel has found a system that works. And Jes\u00fas Navas is the same as ever, only faster \u2013 legs rotating like Road Runner.</p> <p>On the other side, F\u00e1bregas's goals, both superb, were his first since February and his performance the best since he joined the club. Xavi and Sergio Busquets took control. Alexis S\u00e1nchez looks lost. As for Messi, he had a poor game \u2013 just the two assists and a free kick that Palop pushed away from just under the bar. Barcelona came from behind for the fourth time this season; Barcelona have not convinced but Tito Vilanova's changes, usually from 4-3-3 to 3-4-3, are working. Half of their 24 goals this season have arrived in the last 15 minutes, after he has made substitutions. And then there was Villa. Still short of match fitness but there he was in 94th minute.</p> <p>So much was happening, there was so much to focus on, that they did not know where to start. So they started where they always start: with the referee. If Barcelona and Sevilla seemed to be playing without a referee in the first half, Lahoz joined in for the second. He sent off Gary Medel with 20 minutes to go after the Chilean confronted F\u00e1bregas, leaning into him. More head-touch than head-butt. He then failed to see a handball from Thiago in the build up to Villa's winner. And later, he sent off M\u00edchel for protesting. \"I didn't call him 'shameless', no matter what his report says,\" the coach insisted.</p> <p>Others did. The Seville-based newspaper El Correo moaned: \"From scandal to scandal\". \"Nervi\u00f3n,\" added Estadio Deportivo, \"does not drop points \u2013 but points are robbed from it.\" AS gleefully blew up the covers and echoed the complaints. El Mundo Deportivo fought back. On both sides of the divide it all started again; back into the trenches, chucking accusations and conspiracies around. You're the favoured ones, no you are. You're the cheats, no you are. Look at these stats; no, look at <em>these</em> ones.

When he was asked about the card by Canal Plus' touchline reporter after the game, F\u00e1bregas replied: \"he touched my face with his forehead ... if you like, I can do that to you and see what you think.\"</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 It might not have been the best hat-trick ever \u2013 in fact it might have been one of the worst, comprising one header from two yards and two penalties \u2013 but it was still yet another hat-trick for Cristiano Ronaldo.

Astonishing.</p> <p>\u2022 Just when you thought things could not go any more wrong for Athletic, they lose the derby, sit a solitary point from the relegation zone, and on Monday morning an argument between Marcelo Bielsa and Fernando Llorente leads to the striker walking off the training pitch.

Make York a Living Wage City&#xa0;and inspire Yorkshire to become a Living Wage Region.<br>&#xa0;<br>2. Deliver an inclusive approach to economic development&#xa0;that creates jobs, tackles worklessness, and ensures all of York's citizens can contribute and prosper.<br>&#xa0;<br>3. Create a simple and shared system to get help and advice to people,including an easy to access central information hub, outreach centres and promotional activity.<br>&#xa0;<br>4. Urgently address the city's housing and accommodation needs&#xa0;to improve availability and affordability for all, and to support sustainable economic growth, backed by a long term strategic framework.<br>&#xa0;<br>5. Make far greater use of&#xa0;early intervention, preventative measures and community based care&#xa0;to support health, independent living and inclusion.<br>&#xa0;<br>6. Ensure that childcare, the learning environment and education help to tackle inequalities.<br>&#xa0;<br>7: Further&#xa0;assess the full range of ideas and proposals for action&#xa0;made in the report&#xa0;and agree mechanisms for taking them forward.</p> </blockquote> <p>You can read or download the full report from the <a href=\"http://www.yorkfairnesscommission.org.uk\">commission's website, here</a>. </p> <p>Archbishop Sentamu says:</p> <blockquote> <p>You can judge how healthy a society is by how it treats the most vulnerable people. Research has conclusively shown that a more equal society is a happier society. If we want to see York prosper and flourish we must reduce its societal divide. It is our duty and our responsibility.<br>&#xa0;<br>I am delighted that the Fairness Commission is calling for a Living Wage to be introduced across the city. People should be paid a fair wage for a fair day's work \u2013 anything else is unjust. I hope York will take the lead on tackling inequality and that others across the country will follow. It is over to the politicians and the public now.</p> <p>You can judge how healthy a society is by how it treats the most vulnerable people. Research has conclusively shown that a more equal society is a happier society. If we want to see York prosper and flourish we must reduce its societal divide. It is our duty and our responsibility.</p> </blockquote> <p>The commission's chair, <a href=\"http://www.yorkfairnesscommission.org.uk/ruthredfern.html\">Ruth Redfern</a>, says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Our first report's focus was on influencing and advising the council on its budget setting process, squaring the need to make the sizeable cuts forced upon it with commitment to equity and social justice.&#xa0; We are pleased that key recommendations from that report have been taken up, and we hope that action will also be taken on our detailed recommendations in the full report.<br>&#xa0;<br>This takes our work a step further by considering how to promote fairness in the long term and across the whole of York. We believe that reducing inequality, particularly of wealth and incomes, and standing up for and empowering those who are most vulnerable in society will not only increase fairness, but will create benefits to society as a whole.</p> </blockquote> <p>She adds: </p> <blockquote> <p>York was home to the active philanthropist <a href=\"http://www.rowntreesociety.org.uk/\">Joseph Rowntree</a>, whose commitment to finding ways of reducing poverty lives on to this day. It is therefore no surprise that York is, by any measure, a fairer city than most.</p> <p>Our reputation for fairness is also why we recommend that York hosts an international summit on Fairness on behalf of the UK. Our country has much to learn from less unequal societies and learn we should.</p> <p>Our principles to 'fairness-proof' activity and decision making in York are clear and easily followed. Our ideas for action come directly and significantly from the citizens of York. There is nothing in the report that cannot be actioned and will not, when actioned, have a positive effect on fairness.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396967688\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/6/14/1339666098897/Poor-need-rise-in-minimum-002.jpg\" alt=\"Poor 'need rise in minimum wage'\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Minimum wage.

The other crucial background, on a day when the national minimum wage for over-21s <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/oct/01/minimum-wage-over-21s-rises\">crept up</a> by 11p to \u00a36.19 (and 5p more for apprentices who get just \u00a32.65 an hour), is that the council must save \u00a319.7m in the the next two years to meet government spending cuts.</p> <p>Archbishop Sentamu adds:</p> <blockquote> <p>I hope too that the ten Fairness Principles become the blueprint for decision making in York in the years to come. Let us always consider those in need and look to give a voice to the voiceless. As our country goes through tough economic times we need to remember that not<br>all in our society are blessed with good jobs, incomes, housing and leisure opportunities.</p> </blockquote> <p>The ten principles are these: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>1&#xa0;Make reducing income inequalities a core value in decision making, for example by paying a living wage.<br>&#xa0;<br>2&#xa0;Build social factors into procurement and contracting&#xa0;to promote good employment practice, enhance local supply chains, reduce inequalities and heighten opportunities for unemployed people in York.<br>&#xa0;<br>3&#xa0;Strive for&#xa0;excellence in York's organisations and the way they work together&#xa0;so that corporate social responsibility is the norm, services are delivered efficiently and effectively, and the city builds a reputation as a leader in tackling inequalities.<br>&#xa0;<br>4&#xa0;Empower and extend opportunities for disadvantaged groups and<br>individuals.<br>&#xa0;<br>5&#xa0;Adopt a long term view and a preventative approach&#xa0;that acts now to prevent bigger problems in the future.<br>&#xa0;<br>6&#xa0;Take decisions and run services in an open and transparent manner,&#xa0;listening to and engaging with communities and customers, including the most disadvantaged.<br>&#xa0;<br>7&#xa0;Embed a creative and 'can do' culture&#xa0;that strives for new solutions and opportunities, even when there are difficult challenges and limited resources.<br>&#xa0;<br>8&#xa0;Exert influence outside York&#xa0;to address external factors that drive<br>inequalities or restrict local action within the city.<br>&#xa0;<br>9&#xa0;Target investments and services to reduce inequalities&#xa0;and improve life chances in the most disadvantaged areas.<br>&#xa0;<br>10&#xa0;Promote and prioritise&#xa0;sustainable economic growth that maximises opportunities and benefits to all people, including the most disadvantaged (e.g. jobs, wages and wellbeing).</p> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JoE6n7pXwh0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JoE6n7pXwh0?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Here's a YouTube clip of York city council's Labour leader Coun James Alexander talking about the commission last week.</p>",
  "<p>The US supreme court resumes work on Monday, confronting a caseload that could prove every bit as contentious as the legal battle over healthcare reform.</p> <p>Among the most bitterly fought cases are expected to be a number aimed at overturning longstanding civil rights laws by a clutch of Republican-run states who claim they are outdated and unjustly discriminatory against white people.</p> <p>The cases have the potential to strike at the heart of more than half a century of civil rights legislation by potentially abolishing central government oversight of elections in states with a history of systematic racism and dealing a fatal blow to affirmative action in higher education.</p> <p>The supreme court is also likely to take up a more recent human rights issue with equally strong political overtones \u2013 gay marriage.</p> <p>Some Republican state leaders are optimistic that the time is now ripe to take on civil rights legislation because of the supreme court's ideological tilt to the right and clear signals from the chief justice, John Roberts, that he is deeply sceptical about racially based legislation.</p> <p>But Roberts' decision earlier this year to side with the liberal justices in upholding the constitutionality of Barack Obama's healthcare reforms has added a further degree of uncertainty to the perilous game of attempting to predict supreme court decisions.</p> <p>Next week, the justices will consider a challenge to affirmative action in higher education involving a white woman, Abigail Fisher, who says she was the victim of unfair discrimination in favour of minorities when she was refused a place at the University of Texas in Austin.</p> <p>In 2003, a divided supreme court upheld the use of affirmative action in universities to ensure a diverse student body but as only an influencing, not a decisive, factor in admissions.</p> <p>Since then the court has shifted to the right. Samuel Alito joined the bench and persistently challenged policies and legislation based on race. Roberts has also made his scepticism on racially influenced laws known. With that, the court's conservatives would appear to be decisive on the issue.</p> <p>David Gans, civil rights director of the Constitutional Accountability Center, which is a party to the legal action in defence of affirmative action, said the ruling could prove groundbreaking if the court overturns its earlier rulings.</p> <p>\"Is the court going to go back on those precedents? Are the conservatives going to backtrack on these previous decisions?\" Gans asked. \"If it does, that could force a reassessment of affirmative action throughout the education system.\"</p> <p>Gans said that if the court does strike down affirmative action at the University of Texas, the broader impact will depend on how the justices write the judgment. They could reach a narrowly honed decision that deals solely with Texas, which has an unusual, although not unique, parallel system of ensuring diversity by guaranteeing the top 10% of pupils in every state school a place at the University of Texas. Or the judges could finally kill off affirmative action in education altogether.</p> <p>The supreme court is also expected to hear at least one of several challenges to the 1965 Voting Rights Act by state governments unhappy at Washington's power to oversee their conduct of their elections because of a past history of racial discrimination and disenfranchisement.</p> <p>The Obama administration has won a series of federal court cases in recent months over attempts by Republican-led states to require voters to produce photo identification in order to cast their ballots and to redraw constituency boundaries.</p> <p>Courts in Washington DC have struck down attempts by Texas to redraw constituencies because the move diminished the impact of a rapidly growing Latino vote and to require photo identification at the polls, which the court said would discourage minorities from voting. The federal courts effectively accused Texas's Republican-controlled legislature of r<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/28/texas-loses-electoral-maps-latinos\">acial discrimination and attempting to manipulate elections</a>.</p> <p>The justice department has won similar victories over changes to election laws and procedures in other states, including Alabama and Florida, and is awaiting a ruling in a South Carolina case.</p> <p>The supreme court has previously upheld the section of the Voting Rights Act that requires nine states \u2013 Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia \u2013 to seek approval from the justice department for changes to voting laws or procedures. But in 2009, Roberts invited a challenge to the clause in the law giving Washington oversight, known as Section 5, by saying that \"the south has changed\".</p> <p>\"The evil that Section 5 is meant to address may no longer be concentrated in the jurisdictions singled out for pre-clearance. The statute's coverage formula is based on data that is now more than 35 years old, and there is considerable evidence that it fails to account for current political conditions,\" Roberts wrote.</p> <p>It is a Section 5 case in Shelby, Alabama that appears likely to end up before the court first. Shelby county's legal bills are being paid by the Project on Fair Representation, which describes itself as a legal defence fund against the \"outdated\" Section 5.</p> <p>Its director, Edward Blum, said: \"Section 5 was a draconian yet completely necessary provision in 1965 when mostly southern jurisdictions we purposely shutting out blacks from the ballot box\".</p> <p>But he added that times have changes and that \"African Americans and Hispanics no longer live in barrios and ghettos\", and that they now wield considerable political power which negates the need for special protection for minority voters.</p> <p>Defenders of civil rights, including the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, say that the flood of voter ID laws and other the manipulation of election boundaries is evidence of the continued need for legal protections.</p> <p>Gay marriage is also likely to land before the court this term, although it's not immediately clear in what form. One possible route is through challenges to the Defence of Marriage Act (Doma), which requires the federal government to only recognise heterosexual weddings. The effect is to limit benefits, such as tax breaks, and some rights for same-sex couples.</p> <p>A federal appeals court in Boston has overturned that aspect of the law on the grounds that it is for individual state governments to decide who can marry, not Congress.</p> <p>There are also challenges to Doma in the legal pipeline from gay couples demanding full recognition of their marriages by the federal government.</p> <p>There is considerable uncertainty about how the court might decide the issue. Justice Anthony Kennedy is regarded as a decisive vote. He has previously voted to strike down a Texas law criminalising sex between men, as well as an attempt by the Colorado legislature to amend the state constitution to bar laws preventing discrimination against gays.</p> <p>But finding a right for same-sex couples to marry is a much larger step.<br>The first case the justices will hear is over Shell oil's relationship with the Nigerian military. Twelve Nigerians are attempting to sue Shell in the US for allegedly using the army during the dictatorship of General Sani Abacha in the 1990s to brutally suppress protest against oil drilling in the Niger Delta. The supreme court is being asked if US courts have jurisdiction in the case.</p>",

  "<p>\"Are you completely mad?\" one of my authors asked me. \"I thought your agency was deluged by manuscripts \u2013 why ask for more?\"</p> <p>He was wondering why Curtis Brown, one of the UK's largest literary agencies, which receives between 600 and 800 manuscripts a month, wanted to welcome yet more at <a href=\"http://www.foyles.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Foyles</a> in central London last month. <a href=\"http://www.thebookseller.com/news/curtis-brown-and-foyles-team-author-discovery-day.html\" title=\"\">\"Discovery Day\"</a> \u2013 an open day for any unpublished writer to pitch to an agent \u2013 was designed to open up the doors of the seemingly inward-looking publishing industry. </p> <p>Eight minutes of expert feedback were followed by a 15-minute surgery in the caf\u00e9 to probe further, and then a panel discussion with a leading author, a publisher and an agent to round off the day. Three hundred and fifty writers signed up within two days.</p> <p>To be honest, we didn't know what to expect. Hundreds of smartly attired, serious minded and slightly nervous writers trickled through the doors. A 15-year-old schoolgirl who told me she was serious about her writing; a mournful-looking accountant who had quit the profession to finish his first novel, which sadly was not worth quitting the profession for; a heavily accented artist who was willing to listen to edits as long as they didn't change any element of the story. One woman told me about her eco mystery, which sounded good aside from the terms \"eco\" and \"mystery\". We turned it into a high-concept thriller with global impact.</p> <p>A woman came from Texas, another from Cyprus and daytrippers from Southampton and Belfast. One young dad pitched with a baby strapped to his front who remained silent during the whole thing like a true pro. A new breed of writer is emerging. Savvy, informed, focused and in control.</p> <p>So what advice did we give? Drill your story down to 10 words and then build up; if your novel has too much back story it is not a novel but an explanation; speak your dialogue out loud to test if everyone sounds the same ... and so on.</p> <p>Publishing is going through a revolution \u2013 bookshops are in turmoil, self-publishing is on the rise, the big six publishers are on the run \u2013 and yet one truth remains. We all want a good story, told well.

  "<p>Following the passage of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/interactive/2012/feb/07/nhs-bill-guide-interactive\" title=\"\">deeply divisive health bill</a>, we are now in the middle of the authorisation of clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), the bodies that have been given the tricky task of making clinical commissioning a reality. Up and down the country, CCGs are putting forward their credentials and making the case to the new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/30/new-nhs-commissioning-board\" title=\"\">NHS commissioning board</a> that they are ready and able to commission services for their local populations from April 2013. The board will be responsible for directly commissioning services worth around \u00a320bn and for allocating more than \u00a360bn to more than 240 CCGs.</p> <p>Clinical commissioning, as a concept, is one that the British Medical Association (BMA) has been advocating for many years, as the merits of moving the control of services closer to patients and local clinicians are obvious. It could, if done properly, lead to an NHS that is more responsive to the needs of the local community, while empowering doctors to get more involved in shaping the services they deliver. Many doctors and other healthcare professionals have untapped experience and talents that could be harnessed for the benefit of patients.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this proposed new dawn has already been tarnished by the protracted passage of the health bill and the ongoing financial squeeze that could mean there are fewer services available for CCGs to commission. Many GPs are concerned that they could become the administrators of NHS cuts as they are handed responsibility for decimated budgets. The NHS Act 2012 gives CCGs the authority to decide to whom they will provide a service, and what service they will provide. They will be under no obligation to ensure that a whole range of services are available to their catchment population. (There is already <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/31/nhs-rationing-risking-lives-doctors-leader\" title=\"\">rationing</a> of services such as hernia, cataracts and hip or knee replacements). The NHS Act also enables CCGs to enter into joint ventures with private companies to outsource most work to private companies with vested interests, beyond the scope of full public scrutiny.</p> <p>It is a factor that the government refuses to address despite it looming over the entire clinical commissioning process.</p> <p>This worrying mood has been worsened by a number of practical problems emerging on the ground during the early stages of the authorisation phase, particularly with CCG constitutions which will decide how each CCG will operate. GPs are reporting back to the BMA that some GP practices are being pressured into signing constitutions at short notice with barely any time to check how their practice, and patients, will be affected.</p> <p>Others are flagging up that many GPs have a lack of basic information which has left them <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/18/gps-in-the-dark-nhs-reforms\" title=\"\">bemused</a> about the whole process. Government pronouncements about how its reforms will involve doctors more in planning healthcare will fall totally flat if rank-and-file doctors are left scratching their heads on the sidelines. Participation rates among GPs in many CCGs is already reported to be low.</p> <p>There is still time to make clinical commissioning work, but it is in real danger of becoming smothered by a toxic combination of poor implementation, GP disengagement and NHS cuts. This represents a real first challenge for the new health secretary, Jeremy Hunt. He must take action urgently to address the implications of the rushed authorisation phase that could undermine the whole project. And on funding, he must show his mettle by fighting to protect the NHS budget so that CCGs do not simply become the vehicle for cutting back our health service.</p> <p>Time will tell whether Hunt is willing and able to meet these challenges</p> <p>\u2022 This article presents the author's personal views and not those of the BMA</p>",
  "<p>Over the last decade I've been looking to see how processes and approaches that have a proven value in the commercial world can be intelligently adapted to deliver benefit in the non-profit arts and culture arena. I have a background in the commercial sector, and set up <a href=\"https://www.mycake.org/default.aspx\" title=\"\">MyCake</a>, an online toolkit for creative businesses. One area of interest is data, and the opportunity it gives to step beyond organisational boundaries and build collective intelligence tools.</p> <p>Recently, I've been thinking about how we can restructure data mining so that benefits can be acquired by small organisations as well as large. By data mining I don't mean the processes of data acquisition (though the source and quality of data is crucial) but the mining of a database for information on patterns and trends so they can be used to develop bespoke offers to existing customers.</p> <p>This approach is one of the key elements of success for Amazon's \"if you like this then you might like\" function, as well as iTunes and indeed Tesco's clubcard. And data mining is not new to the cultural sector \u2013 it's embedded in the work of some large organisations, including the Barbican or the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre. Dedicated in-house staff and long-term working relationships with data mining experts are also evident in organisations such as Audiences London, Culture Sparks and the Audience Business.</p> <p>The success of data mining is not just a matter of budget, though clearly the annual costs of this work are more easily absorbed within the annual budgets of larger organisations, and the returns on the investment are delivered as increased sales. But budgets aside, the other thing that large organisations bring is a greater number of products \u2013 what in data mining language in called SKUs or stock keeping units.</p> <p>So where Tesco may have 35,000 SKUs per store and a large arts organisation may have hundreds or even thousands of different products in a year (think of a large receiving venue), a small arts organisation may only have half a dozen exhibitions or productions in a year. There simply aren't enough SKUs to mine data at this level.</p> <p>This fundamental difference in the number of SKUs is also one of the reasons why membership schemes work in large organisations but are hard to sustain in small ones \u2013 there simply isn't enough variety in the offer to be able to tailor it for members vs non-members. You can't put together packages of SKUs when you only have six in the first place.</p> <p>In large organisations, membership data also performs a vital role because it allows you to attach data to the individual member and track their activity and therefore predict what might suit them. Do this for thousands of members and you can not only predict the likely success of parts of your programme, but you can proactively market bespoke offers to members.</p> <p>So for data mining to work you need a large volume of products and customers \u2013 no wonder this doesn't work for small organisations. But if smaller organisations could mine data and devise bespoke packages for customers and audiences, they could have greater reach and appeal.</p> <p>Relatively few single large organisations can compete with the sheer variety of what's on offer from a cluster of small organisations. By moving from competition to co-operation, smaller organisations could reach larger audiences and develop a wider appeal, gaining the trust that an individual customer has with one small organisation.</p> <p>There are, however, a couple of barriers to implementation that we need to overcome. First, I'd suggest that most folks working in small arts organisations aren't familiar with data mining and wouldn't have the skills in the organisation to do it even if they had shadowed Tesco or Amazon. So pursuing this idea successfully would need a skills injection. Second, the return on investment is likely to be slower than at large organisations \u2013 smaller ones would be starting from a smaller baseline both in terms of audiences and skills.</p> <p>Perhaps this becomes an argument for using social investment funds rather than arts grants? After all, once it's working well there should be a profit margin that would pay back any loan and interest. Deal flow in some social investment funds is pretty slow at the moment so it would at least be worth a further look. By looking at the profile and plans of organisations such as the <a href=\"http://www.cdfa.org.uk/\">Community Development Finance Association</a> (CDFA), Big Society Capital, Social Investment Business and Nesta's forthcoming social investment fund, you can see that this would be in line with their declared areas of interest.</p> <p>CDFA's summary of how their members invest their monies shows that a very significant proportion of business loans are in the civil society. The CDFA says this is most commonly a loan to cover the cashflow challenges of capital build projects in the arts. The challenge then is to use this knowledge of the sector among the fund providers and fund activities that bring revenue from clicks as well as bricks.</p> <p><em>Sarah Thelwall is founder of </em><a href=\"https://www.mycake.org/default.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>MyCake</em></a><em>, an online toolkit for creative businesses, and the Culture Benchmark \u2013 follow her on Twitter </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/mycakefinance\" title=\"\"><em>@MyCakeFinance</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Two people responsible for sending out millions of spam texts offering accident compensation and payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling services face fines totalling about half a million pounds, following a crackdown by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).</p> <p>Another eight companies could face similar fines as the data enforcement office concentrates on unsolicited texts, which its research has shown is one of the most annoying examples of unwanted marketing people receive.</p> <p>The case is the first of its kind in which the ICO has used its new powers to levy fines of up to \u00a3500,000 for misuse of personal data.</p> <p>Among the abuses cited are that the texts had no named sender, and that when people texted \"STOP\" to be taken off the list, their number was added to a new list, which was then sold to other companies for further spam marketing.</p> <p>It is also illegal to send text marketing messages or automated marketing calls to people who have not opted to receive them from the company involved \u2013 which also means any company that used the numbers collected from \"STOP\" texts would be breaking the law.</p> <p>The ICO <a href=\"http://ico.gov.uk/news/latest_news/2012/illegal-marketers-set-for-six-figure-penalty-01102012.aspx\" title=\"\">said</a> more cases were in the pipeline as it tries to stamp out such practices. \"Those who blatantly break the law will be in line for a sizeable six-figure penalty from the ICO,\" said Simon Entwisle, the office's director of operations.</p> <p>The individuals, who have not yet been named, have been given 28 days to respond to the ICO to explain how their activities were legal. If they cannot, then a \"final penalty notice\" will come into force, making them personally liable for the payment.</p> <p>They were both linked to a company that is registered under the Data Protection Act, but which the ICO said broke the law in sending the texts.</p> <p>Entwisle said: \"The public have told us that they are increasingly concerned about the illegal marketing texts and calls. These are often made by rogue companies claiming to offer payouts for accidents a person has never had or payment protection insurance claims that they are not necessarily entitled to.\"</p> <p>He added: \"While companies can phone people to sell them the latest product or service, the law states that individuals should not receive unsolicited texts or automated marketing calls unless they have given their permission.\"</p> <p>The ICO said it had been investigating the two individuals since the end of last year. \"They are linked to the same company, and are ultimately responsible for the actions of the company,\" said a spokesman.</p> <p>UK-based marketing companies are forbidden from calling people who have registered their numbers with the free <a href=\"http://www.mpsonline.org.uk/tps/\" title=\"\">Telephone Preference Service</a> unless they have received explicit consent.</p> <p>However, the growth in availability of automated diallers and databases of mobile phone numbers, plus the rise of low-cost internet-to-SMS \"gateways\", has made it easier and cheaper for scammers to send out huge numbers of texts indiscriminately.</p> <p>The ICO said in the past six months, since it began asking people to forward examples of spam texts, it had received nearly 30,000 examples.</p>",
  "<p>The internationally acclaimed author Haruki Murakami has criticised the \"hysteria\" over an ongoing territorial row between Japan and China, accusing both countries of inflaming the situation by using nationalist rhetoric.</p> <p>The long-running dispute over the Senkaku islands \u2013 known as the Diaoyu in China \u2013 intensified earlier this month after Japan nationalised the territories, resulting in violent anti-Japanese demonstrations in dozens of Chinese cities.</p> <p>Murakami, who enjoys a huge following in China, could have been expected to criticise the authorities there amid reports that they had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/25/japanese-books-removed-sale-china-row-islands\" title=\"\">banned </a>the sale of Japan-related books, including his own novels.</p> <p>Instead, he called on Japan and China to wean themselves off the \"cheap alcohol\" of nationalism, as both sides refused to make concessions.</p> <p>\"When a territorial issue ceases to be a practical matter and enters the realm of 'national emotions', it creates a dangerous situation with no exit,\" Murakami wrote in a front-page opinion piece for the Asahi Shimbun.</p> <p>\"It's like cheap alcohol. It gets you drunk after only a few shots and makes you hysterical. It makes you speak loudly and act rudely&#xa0;\u2026 but after your drunken rampage you are left with nothing but an awful headache the next morning.</p> <p>\"We must be careful about politicians and polemicists who lavish us with this cheap alcohol and allow things to get out of control.\"</p> <p>Murakami, Japan's best-known living author whose books have been translated into 40 languages, made the comments after Japan and China continued to trade verbal blows at the United Nations general assembly in New York.</p> <p>China's foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, said China considered the islands \"sacred territory\" and accused Japan of theft after it bought them from their private owners \u2013 who are Japanese \u2013 in a bid to derail a similar, and potentially more provocative, move by the rightwing governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara.</p> <p>The dispute risks souring diplomatic and trade ties between the world's second- and third-largest economies. Threats of a widespread boycott of Japanese imports have so far failed to materialise, although Japanese firms are reporting delays in processing paperwork for goods at Chinese ports.</p> <p>Chinese employees of Japanese companies have staged walkouts, demanding higher wages; carmakers, including Toyota and Nissan, have said they will cut production in China in anticipation of a fall in demand.</p> <p>\"It's almost inevitable that many Japanese business leaders [with investments in China] will say that enough is enough,\" said Tomohiko Taniguchi, a former foreign ministry spokesman who now teaches at Keio University. \"Wages in China are going up and other countries in the region, such as Burma, are looking more attractive. This dispute can only accelerate the business community's shift in another direction.\"</p> <p>Tens of thousands of flight bookings from China to Japan have been cancelled through to the end of this month. It marks a dramatic reversal in fortunes for Japanese tourist authorities, who had issued a record number of visas to Chinese tourists between May and the latest eruption of the Senkaku dispute.</p> <p>China has so far been the target of small demonstrations by Japanese ultra-nationalists, a few hundred of whom marched through Tokyo recently carrying banners calling for Chinese boats to be sunk and urging Japan's government not to give in to the \"terrorists\" in Beijing.</p> <p>No ban exists on travel to Japan, but the Chinese media have devoted coverage to the demonstrations and isolated incidents, such as a smoke-bomb attack on a Chinese consulate in south-west Japan. They have also made much of a recent poll in which only 3% of Japanese said they liked China, while 38% said they disliked the country.</p> <p>Opinion is divided on how much lasting damage a trade spat would inflict on the countries, whose bilateral trade ties were worth a record $345bn (\u00a3213bn) last year.</p> <p>But the dispute has ruined what was supposed to be a weekend of celebrations this week to mark 40 years of diplomatic ties.</p> <p>China abruptly cancelled a major event in Beijing to mark the anniversary, while Japan's prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, and the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, did not exchange congratulatory messages.</p> <p>About 40% of anniversary ceremonies due to be held in Japan were cancelled, according to Kyodo, with more than half called off at China's request.</p> <p>The cancellations were a sign of the dispute's impact on people-to-people ties, said Duan Yuezhong, the chief editor of a magazine for Chinese people living in Japan. \"We are working hard to promote private-level exchange, but our efforts have been spoiled. We feel helpless,\" he told Kyodo.</p> <p>Murakami said he was disappointed by reports that bookshops in China had been ordered to remove works by Japanese authors, as well as those about Japan by Chinese writers.</p> <p>The Beijing municipal bureau of press and publication has denied issuing the order, but there are widespread reports of shops clearing their shelves of books, including Murakami's bestselling trilogy 1Q84.</p> <p>The row has also affected the Chinese music and art world. The pianist, Yundi Li, reportedly came under pressure from the authorities in Beijing to cancel a solo recital tour of Japan due to start last month and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/26/floating-city-tokyo-international-film-festival\" title=\"\">Hong Kong-Chinese film, Floating City, has been withdrawn</a> from the forthcoming Tokyo international film festival at the request of the producers.</p> <p>Murakami urged Japan not to retaliate by, for example, banning Chinese books. \"Here is what I'd say loud and clear,\" he wrote. \"Please don't retaliate against China for taking such steps. If we do, it becomes our problem, and it will come back and hit you.\"</p>",

Franklin will be at the Tory party conference next week, while other \"welfare warriors\" were at the Lib Dem conference last week and this week's Labour party conference in Manchester. She says while disability and welfare weren't on the agenda at last year's conferences, <a href=\"http://benefitscroungingscum.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/party-politics-and-penis-polling-lab12.html\">this year \"we are being listened to\"</a>. And she adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All any of us can promise when lobbying like this is that we will do our utmost to explain, persuade and bring about change. It is definitely the cumulative impact of so many different groups of sick and disabled people all campaigning to their strengths whether that be by direct action or the more subtle charm and disarm which are pushing forward progress. If we stop to look up we see our friends still suffering terribly at the hands of this cruel system, but if we turn to look back we can see just how far we have all travelled and look forward with hope to a time of change. </p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 The astonishing findings of a new poll by the thinktank Demos, which reveals that most people believe the government <a href=\"http://www.demos.co.uk/press_releases/majority-support-government-control-of-how-people-spend-benefit-payments\">should start controlling how welfare recipients spend their money</a>. Almost nine out of 10 people said at least one group of <strong>welfare recipients</strong> \u2013 such as those with a substance or gambling addiction, or those with a criminal or anti-social history \u2013 should have their benefits controlled. Demos's deputy director Claudia Wood said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It suggests that many now view the welfare state as a form of charity towards the poor rather than social insurance for all. If the majority still saw the welfare state as an insurance scheme - a contract of protection in return for contribution - then people would be more supportive of autonomy for benefit claimants.<br>The government's rhetoric around 'problem families' and 'scroungers' is clearly shaking people's faith in the welfare state. Those wishing to restore it will need to find a response that reassures a nervous public.</p> </blockquote> <p><br> (thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Eugene_Grant\">Eugene Grant</a> for the link)</p> <p>\u2022 The <strong>Care Inquiry</strong>, a newly launched <a href=\"http://thecareinquiry.wordpress.com/2012/09/27/an-introduction-to-the-care-inquiry/\">collaboration between eight children's charities</a>, which aims to explore how society can best provide secure and stable homes for our most vulnerable children.

The social care people, the binmen, the teachers and the housing staff.<br>And wouldn't it be good if there was a single issue \u2013 as well as everything \u2013 to focus on too.

  "<p><strong>Hi Daniele, can you tell us a little bit more about </strong><a href=\"http://www.cheil.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Cheil</strong></a><strong> and your role there as head of innovation? </strong></p> <p>Until recently Cheil UK has been one of London's best-kept secrets. It's a 100-strong integrated advertising agency \u2013 my job there as head of innovation is to make sure we stop being a secret and grow beyond our original Samsung heritage with new clients. That means working hard to build a culture that fosters innovation and ideas. It also means staying on top of current trends, understanding any impact they could have on our clients and their communications issues, and consequently delivering better ways to solve problems for them.</p> <p>Before Cheil I ran a global digital marketing agency called <a href=\"http://www.profero.com/\" title=\"\">Profero</a> with two friends. We grew it from 22 people in London to more than 300, with offices in London, Madrid, Milan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney and New York. I left to run my own consultancy for 18 months, and then joined Cheil.</p> <p><strong>What does your average day look like?</strong></p> <p>Fortunately, there's no such thing as an average day (one of the reasons I left Profero after 10 years is because all of a sudden I found I was constantly doing the same things). Now my days will comprise of anything and everything including work on client briefs, team brainstorms, new business meetings, internal team talks and external recruitment interviews. And I always make an effort every week to meet someone interesting, preferably at lunch or for a quick drink after work!</p> <p><strong>What are the biggest challenges to your job and how do you overcome them?</strong></p> <p>My biggest challenge is figuring out where to focus my energy; my role inevitably means there's so much I could cover, but not enough time to cover it. Lists are my saving grace \u2013 I've become much better at using them to prioritise, and working closely with my boss and peers to bounce ideas around also helps to maintain perspective.</p> <p><strong>What first made you want to work in advertising?</strong></p> <p>Not many people know this, but my first work in advertising was actually starring in a TV commercial (it was for a series of karaoke tapes from Italian publisher Fabbri Editori and I'm thankful there was no YouTube in those days). That was my first taste of the energy that's inherent in this business, but my big break came when I was looking to leave PwC (I started my career as an accountant) and one of my best friends asked me to join his little digital advertising agency. I was extremely lucky to get that opportunity \u2013 that agency was Profero \u2013 and I've never looked back since.</p> <p><strong>What's do you think is the key to being a good at what you do as head of innovation?</strong></p> <p>Innovation for me is about finding better ways to solve problems as well as opening up opportunities that weren't there previously. It's left brain and right brain working in sync to create compelling and practical solutions. My business background coupled with my agency experience allows me to really marry an idea with solving a business problem in that way. One of the big attractions of Cheil is that it's unavoidably integrated, which means ideas aren't limited by a media discipline or channel.</p> <p>The other key ingredient is an interest in people, something which I've always had \u2013 it's this inherent curiosity about what motivates people to make decisions that also helps in my role. Finally, you need to be a self-starter because a lot of the time, it really is up to you to create opportunities.</p> <p><strong>What would you say your management style is?</strong></p> <p>When I was 18 years old my parents let me manage their restaurant for 6 months, with very little interference. That experience taught me a lot, with the most notable lesson being: give people the room and space to make their own decisions and mistakes while still giving them direction and support when they need it. I hope that's how I manage. My expectations are high, certainly, and I can be quite tough, but I always try to be fair too. This approach clearly isn't for everyone but I hope I foster good team communication, and people enjoy working with me.</p> <p><strong>What online resource can you not do your job without?</strong></p> <p>That's impossible to answer because I'm constantly online and hungry for ideas and inspiration. But if push really came to shove, I'd hate to lose the people I follow on Twitter.</p> <p><strong>What in advertising is really exciting you the most at the moment?</strong></p> <p>No question, it's the fact that social media has changed the communications landscape forever, and we still don't really know what the long term impact will be.

  "<p>With Christmas already invading our high streets may I draw your attention to a delightful new book about English spelling by David Crystal (<a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781846685675\">Spell It Out, Profile Books, \u00a310.39 hardback</a>)? It is not actually concerned with crosswords, but reading it makes clear why English as a language is so suited to the cryptic crossword. (It does not help, though, to explain why our modern cryptic crossword has never really caught on in the American-English world.)</p> <p>The delight of English for crossword setters is that, because of its mongrel cross-breeding over the centuries, it is a chaotic language in its spelling and pronunciation. Why is the 'ch' in 'chaos' pronounced as a 'k' but not the 'ch' in 'change'? Why did a CHurCH in English become a KirK in Scottish? Why is there a silent 'h' in GHOST, but not in GORSE? How can words with exactly the same spelling, like WIND and SOW, be pronounced entirely differently, have entirely different meanings and, indeed, be different parts of speech? When and why did the old letter called the thorn, representing the sound for 'th' in, for example, THE and looking a bit like a modern 'y', drop out of usage, being retained today only in a phrase like YE OLDE TEASHOP? All this and much more is lucidly and humorously explained in this excellent book, as it traces how our original Germanic Anglo-Saxon coped with the arrival of the Latin alphabet, of the French in 1066, of medieval scribes, of changes in pronunciation, of William Caxton and printing, of Dr Johnson and of the more or less successful efforts of lexicographers over the last 200 years to rationalise the 'system'. It is a system that is chock-a-block with all the anomalies, variations and irregularities that are grist to the cryptic setter's mill.<br>The book has an interesting final section on the impact of globalisation and the internet on English-English spelling. In business, globalisation has in effect meant Americanisation and that will surely be its consequence here. Until the late 1970s English billions and trillions were a thousand times larger than their American counterparts. The Financial Times, not surprisingly, was the first to give in and switch to the American usage and the rest of the British media soon followed suit. That trend will continue.</p> <p>The internet, though, introduces a different dimension. In the old days individuals, like Winston Churchill, may have had great difficulty in spelling properly in private correspondence, but in formal letters and published writing in newspapers and books there was always a filter of competent secretaries, subeditors, readers and professional publishers at hand to \"correct mistakes\", since dictionaries and grammarians laid down what was right and what was wrong. Today the internet, as is increasingly recognised, has completely democratised publishing of all kinds, from blogs to e-books and everything in between. There is no longer any system of formal editing and correction between the writer and the reader. Does it not follow that, if a particular usage or spelling establishes itself in the blogosphere, it will sooner rather than later become recognised as legitimate by the online dictionary editors of this new world (and, for that matter, by crossword editors)?<br>_____<br>I still get a steady trickle of cries for help from those who are suddenly told that the puzzle they want up on their screens is not available, or that they cannot get a proper grid to show. The most likely cause is that, for some reason or other, your computer's Java add-on has switched itself off. This can happen, for example, when you upload the latest version of some other software, or when you add a new software toy. So you should check that your Java program (without which the crosswords cannot be read) is still enabled; or, if it has disappeared entirely, you should reload a Java program.

  "<p>Here's education secretary Michael Gove <a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Transcript-of-Afternoon-Hearing-29-May-2012.txt\">speaking to the Leveson inquiry in May this year</a> about regulation of the press: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"I have a prior belief that we should use the existing laws of the land and individuals and institutions should be judged fairly, on the basis of the existing laws of the land\u2026 And that the case for regulation needs to be made very strongly before we further curtail liberty.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Gove went on to express what he described as a strong \"bias, a prejudice, a predisposition to favour free expression\" and spoke out against current libel laws.</p> <p>It would not be far-fetched to say he was passionate about the cause of press freedom. </p> <p>From today, however, Gove's department will be seeking to enforce a law that most editors, probably all, believe to be inimical to press freedom. </p> <p>Under section 13 of the Education Act 2011, it is now an offence to publish anything likely to identify a teacher who is alleged to have committed a criminal act against a pupil at the same school where that allegation has been made by, or on behalf of, the said pupil.</p> <p>Intense lobbying against section 13 by the Society of Editors (SoE) and the trade body that acts for regional and local publishers, the Newspaper Society, did water it down slightly.</p> <p>But the threat remains, and it does amount to a constraint on press freedom, as the SoE executive director, Bob Satchwell, has made clear in <a href=\"http://www.societyofeditors.co.uk/page-view.php?pagename=News&amp;parent_page_id=0&amp;news_id=4530&amp;numbertoprintfrom=1&amp;language={language}\">a statement on the SoE website:</a></p> <blockquote> <p>\"It will be a criminal offence for anyone \u2013 pupil, parent, police, school, local authority, whistle-blower, media \u2013 even to inform parents or the general public that an identified teacher has admitted that the allegation is true and has resigned, has been disciplined, or even cautioned for the offence.</p> <p>\"Although we acknowledge teachers' fears about false accusations, the most important issue is surely to protect children. Malicious allegations by pupils are extremely rare and alongside this the laws of libel, contempt and confidence already restrict newspapers from repeating and publishing unsubstantiated accusations.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Satchwell's statement came just before an Eastbourne teacher, Jeremy Forrest, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/sep/28/megan-stammers-jeremy-forrest-found-bordeaux\">was arrested in France on suspicion of abducting 15-year-old Megan Stammers</a>.</p> <p>Yet, <a href=\"http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/law-would-have-given-jeremy-forrest-anonymity-condemned-ludicrous\">said Press Gazette,</a> his arrest occurred \"as a direct result of media coverage\".</p> <p>From today, he would have had automatic anonymity unless a magistrate was prepared to rule otherwise. In other words, news organisations would need to apply to a court, as a spokesman for Gove's department admitted. </p> <p>He said that in such cases as the Forrest-Stammers affair, \"the police, media organisations and others will be able to apply to a magistrate for an order lifting teacher anonymity.\"</p> <p>He added: \"If it is in the best interest of the child, this will be granted straightaway so the public can help the police. No teacher who has been charged with an offence, or where a warrant for arrest has been issued, will enjoy anonymity.\"</p> <p>But Satchwell countered that the new law would indeed affect such cases:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The idea that going to court is easy is a nonsense. It's time-consuming and expensive and any application is likely to be opposed. We've seen from other cases that social services and the police are not always quick to act and this is one of the arguments that we made to the education department.</p> <p>\"The ministers seem to be relying on speedy action by the police to bring charges, but the opposite is likely to be true.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Trinity Mirror executive David Higgerson <a href=\"http://davidhiggerson.wordpress.com/2012/09/27/the-trained-journalist-who-has-taken-us-a-step-closer-to-a-secret-state/\">also raised objections about the need to convince a magistrate about it being in the public interest</a> to publish stories involving teacher-pupil relationships. </p> <p>He also points specifically to Gove's journalistic background, saying that \"the man who began his career at the Aberdeen Press and Journal\u2026 now has the dubious honour of being the journalist who made it harder for reporters to report the facts.\"</p> <p>Gove was also noted during his days as a leader writer at The Times, just prior to his going into parliament, for being a champion of press freedom.</p> <p>Higgerson concedes that section 13 may be \"rooted in honourable intentions\" because there have been occasions when teachers who have been subjected to malicious allegations by teenagers. </p> <p>\"But,\" he writes, \"banning any form of communication which risks identifying the person accused of an allegation is the wrong way to solve it. Expelling pupils who make the allegations would be a much better way to go.\"</p> <p>And he raises questions about local education authorities opposing attempts by the press (and police) to lift reporting bans. Say a council department wished, for its own reasons, keep such a case under wraps?</p> <p>Then, of course, there is the problem that people in an area where an incident occurs will get to know about it anyway. \"Schools, like all communities, will gossip,\" writes Higgerson. \"Everyone at the school will know the allegations, and probably know over-egged versions of them too.\"</p> <p>Until today, the media was able play some part in keeping such playground rumours in check. So, Mr Gove, what was that you were saying about the need to ensure that regulation does not curtail liberty?</p> <p><em>Sources:</em> <a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Transcript-of-Afternoon-Hearing-29-May-2012.txt\">Leveson inquiry</a>/<a href=\"http://www.societyofeditors.co.uk/page-view.php?pagename=News&amp;parent_page_id=0&amp;news_id=4530&amp;numbertoprintfrom=1&amp;language={language}\">Society of Editors</a>/<a href=\"http://www.newspapersoc.org.uk/27/sep/12/teacher-anonymity-comes-into-force\">Newspaper Society</a>/<a href=\"http://davidhiggerson.wordpress.com/2012/09/27/the-trained-journalist-who-has-taken-us-a-step-closer-to-a-secret-state/\">David Higgerson</a>/<a href=\"http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/law-would-have-given-jeremy-forrest-anonymity-condemned-ludicrous\">Press Gazette</a></p>",
  "<p>There are just over two weeks to go until <a href=\"http://themanbookerprize.com/the-man-booker-prize-2012\" title=\"\">the 2012 Man Booker prize</a> judges announce their verdict. As usual, no one really has the faintest idea of the outcome. This year's jury has been impressively disciplined. The key to unlocking the mystery of this prize has always been the internal dynamic of the panel.</p> <p>Thanks, too, to the grown-up chairmanship of Peter Stothard, there have been none of the silly, ephemeral brouhahas that have blighted previous shortlists. Stothard has not only come up with one of the best shortlists in living memory, he has also treated it with respect.</p> <p>Indeed, everything Stothard has said about the prize (not much, frankly) has been sensible, measured and quite interesting. I don't envy him and his colleagues the task of choosing between <a href=\"http://www.themanbookerprize.com/people/hilary-mantel\" title=\"\">Hilary Mantel</a> v <a href=\"http://www.themanbookerprize.com/people/will-self\" title=\"\">Will Self</a> v <a href=\"http://www.themanbookerprize.com/people/deborah-levy\" title=\"\">Deborah Levy</a> v <a href=\"http://www.themanbookerprize.com/people/alison-moore\" title=\"\">Alison Moore</a>, etc. But that's another story.</p> <p>Chairing Britain's top book prize, meanwhile, offers a tempting platform for sounding off. Even such a zen master of discretion and self-control as Stothard has not been able to resist trailing his coat.</p> <p>Last week, worrying aloud, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/sep/25/books-bloggers-literature-booker-prize-stothard?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">he took aim at what he saw as the diminished critical standards of the literary blogosphere</a>. Speaking to the Independent, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/the-bionic-book-worm-8168123.html\" title=\"\">Stothard said</a>, \"There is a widespread sense in the UK, as well as America, that traditional, confident criticism, based on argument and telling people whether the book is any good, is in decline.\" He went on: \"Criticism needs confidence in the face of extraordinary external competition. It is wonderful that there are so many blogs and websites devoted to books, but to be a critic is to be importantly different than those sharing their own taste \u2026 Not everyone's opinion is worth the same.\"</p> <p>Rather than simply denounce this position, I think we should take it seriously. Stothard has a point: the citizen journalist's review is not the same as the professional critic's.</p> <p>Consider the standard print review of a book in, say, the Observer, the Times, the TLS or the New York Review of Books. Such a review will usually run somewhere between 500 and 1,500 words. Before publication, it will be subjected to a prolonged and intense process of subediting. Crucially, it will be signed, and usually paid for. Compared with the raw material of your average blog, it has been refined and distilled to within an inch of its life.</p> <p>None of this guarantees that such a review will not be savage, destructive, ad hominem or partisan, but it will be considered, and it will loosely articulate the idiolect of literary criticism, a genre that stretches back to Hazlitt, Coleridge, Emerson, Dr Johnson and Macaulay, to name but a few. Any good print reviewer today stands on the shoulders of giants. In other words, such criticism is a) professional, b) not anonymous and c) placed in a literary critical context.</p> <p>No question: the power concentrated in a few hands has, in the past, been bad for the publishing ecology. Agreed: the democracy of the blogosphere has given voice to neglected points of view.</p> <p>There is, however, a case for some self-discipline, and self-consciously high standards. Stothard has sounded a timely warning bell. Here's hoping some of us in this trade will take note of his remarks, and strive to elevate the quality of the debate.</p>",
  "<p>The BBC has said it is categorically untrue that it turned a blind eye to alleged inappropriate behaviour by Sir Jimmy Savile after several women claimed they were sexually abused by the late Jim'll Fix It presenter.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the BBC on Monday described claims of a cover-up around the sexual assault allegations about Savile, who died in October 2011, as malicious and unfounded.</p> <p>BBC current affairs show Newsnight shelved an investigation into Savile late last year after being unable to substantiate the allegations.</p> <p>However, the allegations have resurfaced ahead of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/sep/28/jimmy-savile-abused-girls-alleged\" title=\"\">an ITV1 documentary to be broadcast on Wednesday</a>. Up to 10 women are said to have come forward to claim they were sexually abused by Savile when he was a BBC presenter in the 1970s.</p> <p>The documentary will allege that Savile abused girls in his trademark Rolls-Royce and at BBC Television Centre in west London.</p> <p>Savile, 84 when he died, worked as a BBC TV presenter regularly from the 1960s until the early 1990s, on shows including Top of the Pops and Jim'll Fix It. He was also a BBC Radio 1 DJ for nearly 20 years from the late 1960s.</p> <p>\"The BBC has conducted extensive searches of its files to establish whether there is any record of misconduct or allegations of misconduct by Sir Jimmy Savile during his time at the BBC. No such evidence has been found,\" the BBC said in a statement.</p> <p>\"Whilst the BBC condemns any behaviour of the type alleged in the strongest terms, in the absence of evidence of any kind found at the BBC that corroborates the allegations that have been made, it is simply not possible for the corporation to take any further action.\"</p> <p>Regarding the Newsnight investigation into Savile, the BBC said: \"It is absolutely untrue that the Newsnight investigation was dropped for anything other than editorial reasons. We have been very clear from the start that the piece was not broadcast because the story we were pursuing could not be substantiated. To say otherwise is false and very damaging to the BBC and individuals.</p> <p>\"To allege that we are withholding evidence from the police is also damaging and false. The notion that internal pressure was applied appears to be a malicious rumour.\"</p> <p>The Childline founder Esther Rantzen, who worked at the BBC at the same time as Savile, has said that the TV industry blocked its ears to claims about the former Jim'll Fix It host at the height of his fame.</p> <p>\"I felt Jim had persuaded us all, audiences, fans, television professionals, even the Pope, to create a myth around Saintly Jim so that he became untouchable,\" <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2210987/Jimmy-Savile-fooled-thinking-saint-says-Esther-Rantzen.html?videoPlayerURL=http%3A%2F%2Fc.brightcove.com%2Fservices%2Fviewer%2Ffederated_f9%3FisVid%3D1%26isUI%3D1%26publisherID%3D1418450360%26playerID%3D72484359001%26domain%3Dembed%26videoId%3D&amp;hasBCVideo=true&amp;BCVideoID=1869824451001\" title=\"\">Rantzen wrote in the Daily Mail on Monday</a>. \"One of the assaults had even been witnessed by the member of a television production team. So why was nothing done?\"</p> <p>Savile's nephew, Roger Foster, defended him: \"I just get so disgusted and disappointed by it. The guy hasn't been dead for a year yet and they're bringing these stories out. It could affect his legacy, his charity work, everything. I'm very sad and disgusted.</p> <p>\"I just don't understand the motives behind this. I just think it's very, very sad you can say these things after someone's died and the law says you can't defend yourself when you're dead.\"</p> <p>A former BBC producer, Sue Thompson, told ITV documentary makers that she witnessed Savile kissing a girl aged about 14 who was sat on his knee in his BBC dressing room.</p> <p>Several claims to be made in the ITV documentary, Exposure: the Other Side of Jimmy Savile, relate to abuse alleged to have taken place on BBC premises. The documentary, which follows a year-long investigation by former Surrey police child protection officer Mark Williams-Thomas, also claims some BBC producers had been aware of Savile's behaviour as long ago as the mid-1960s.</p> <p>An ITV spokesman said: \"This documentary is the result of an in-depth investigation into long-standing allegations of serious and widespread sexual misconduct by Sir Jimmy Savile. Because of the very serious nature of the claims made by several interviewees in relation to this, particular care and consideration was of course given to the decision to produce and broadcast this programme.</p> <p>\"The programme takes full account of the fact that Sir Jimmy is not here to defend himself against these claims.\"</p> <p>Peter Rippon, the editor of Newsnight, said in May that the programme had been dropped for editorial reasons and not due to internal pressure over allegations that abuse took place on BBC premises.</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>I can't remember the last time I chose to eat in a hotel restaurant. Controlled by accountants, designed by committee, cravenly crowd-pleasing and a mere add-on to the main business, most can be placed on a sliding scale that starts at very bad and tops out at <a href=\"http://www.talbotmalton.co.uk/pages/news/story/james-martin-in-collaboration-with-talbot-hotel-malton\">boring</a>. </p> <p>The feel of most hotels doesn't help. The hustle, the bustle, the business suits in the bar, it all feels like a conveyor belt, a commercial terminus where food is but one route in and out. Surely what you want to feel in a restaurant is some personality, some sense that the place is individual, unique, a loved living entity. Which, in a five-star hotel, is mighty difficult to achieve. <br><br>Nico Ladenis came up with one solution when he moved to the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/reaching-for-three-stars-on-park-lane-nico-ladenis-has-moved-into-the-grand-end-of-the-market-emily-green-visited-his-old-and-new-addresses-1540539.html\">Grosvenor House Hotel</a> in 1992. He insisted on an unusual set-up. Hotel guests weren't able to come down from their rooms and walk straight in to his restaurant. Instead, they had to go outside on to Park Lane and use the Chez Nico entrance like everyone else. In a way, this was typical of the man: <a href=\"http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/25/03/1999/8385/The-classical-Greek.htm\">Ladenis</a> didn't do compromise. He was notorious for chucking a wobbly if a guest <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/restaurants/when-marco-met-nico-6340997.html\">asked for salt</a> or had the temerity to order a second G&amp;T. He even <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/jul/06/worlds-rudest-chef\">ordered customers</a> to sit up straight.</p> <p>By making sure his restaurant was physically separated from its hotel home he demonstrated the attitude that many people, chefs and diners, have to hotel restaurants. As Jeff Galvin, who worked at Chez Nico, recalls: \"a fence went up around the restaurant,\" and there was, he says, a kind of \"bravado that you don't really need hotel guests.\"</p> <p>With <a href=\"http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/21/09/2006/308934/Chris-and-Jeff-Galvin.htm\">his brother Chris</a>, Jeff Galvin now runs the Michelin-starred <a href=\"http://www.galvinatwindows.com/\">restaurant</a> at the Park Lane Hilton and has just opened <a href=\"http://www.caterersearch.com/blogs/guide-girl/2012/05/chris-and-jeff-galvin-to-open-two-restaurants-in-edinburgh.html\">La Pompadour at Edinburgh's Caledonian</a>. Galvin takes a very different view to Ladenis: he sees having hundreds of potential customers in the same building as a boon. The Galvins have direct control over how their restaurants look, and after agreeing food margins and labour costs with Hilton, they are left to it on everything from staffing to sourcing. Galvin has lived in Edinburgh for two months, not because Hilton demanded it, but because he wants the kitchen to shine.</p> <p>Whether it does remains to be seen. As does whether Angela Hartnett can make a fist of her <a href=\"http://www.bighospitality.co.uk/People/Angela-Hartnett-to-launch-new-restaurant-at-Lime-Wood-Hotel\">new restaurant project</a> at Lime Wood. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/26/nathan-outlaw-fish-seafood-grill\">Nathan Outlaw</a>, meanwhile, is about to launch a second Seafood &amp; Grill restaurant in Knightsbridge, at <a href=\"http://www.capitalhotel.co.uk/\">the Capital</a>. Outlaw told <a href=\"http://www.theworlds50best.com/restaurant-magazine/\">Restaurant Magazine</a> that he will be ferrying fish up from Cornwall, visiting weekly to oversee the kitchen (to be run by Pete Biggs, who has worked for Outlaw for 10 years) and, generally, making sure that this hotel consultancy does nothing to diminish his reputation. Boldly, Outlaw's team will look after the complete food and beverage operation at the hotel. Chefs often see cooking breakfast and delivering room service as an unwelcome distraction, but, says Galvin, it can be done: \"We did look at <a href=\"http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/29/11/2007/317558/Galvins-are-forced-to-shelve-plans-for-Waldorf-brasserie.htm\">the Waldorf</a> in the Strand, to take over the whole F&amp;B. I wouldn't have a problem doing it. It's just getting the circumstances correct.\"</p> <p>Much as I like the idea of Nathan Outlaw scrutinising my kippers, none of this makes me question my stance that hotel restaurants are best avoided. The Galvins have proven it is possible to create a restaurant that resonates beyond the lobby, but it remains so rare as to be statistically irrelevant. Heston Blumenthal's <a href=\"http://www.dinnerbyheston.com/\">Dinner</a>, for instance, serves excellent food but feels swanky and charmless in comparison to the odd, homely Fat Duck.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2012/may/11/sleeperz-hotel-newcastle-upon-tyne\">budget city hotels</a> the food is, invariably, manufactured catering meh made available only because the hotel knows a good proportion of guests - too lazy or unimaginative to eat elsewhere - will demand it and pay through the nose for it. Move up a level and you find salaried chefs with little real control going through the motions, or hotels attempting and failing to disguise their cynicism beneath a veneer of celebrity glamour. It barely matters to Marco Pierre White, I imagine, professionally or existentially, how much or how little his magic rubs off on <a href=\"http://www.sanguinehospitality.com/marco-pierre-white\">Sanguine Hospitality's</a> branded MPW restaurants. But the meal I ate at Liverpool's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2012/feb/17/hotel-review-indigo-liverpool\">Hotel Indigo</a> earlier this year bore about as much relation to MPW in his pomp as this blogpost does to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/feb/17/michael-hoffman-joseph-roth-flight\">Joseph Roth's best feuilletons</a>.</p> <p>On the plate too, even good hotel restaurants can feel coolly calculated: an attempt to <a href=\"http://www.mallory.co.uk/food-at-mallory/simon-haigh.shtml\">bag a star</a> and boost commercial profiles rather than an act of uninhibited creativity. I ate (some) very nice food at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2012/aug/03/hotel-review-brockencote-hall-worcestershire\">Brockencote Hall</a> recently, but will it ever be the scene of truly risky, revelatory cooking? I doubt it. Perhaps that was what was bugging Nico Ladenis, the thought that even the greatest hotel restaurant will always feel second best. Or do you know different?</p>",
  "<p>Like quite a few successful technology companies, the story began with a teenager starting a business in his bedroom equipped just with a PC and a dial-up modem. That teenager was me and I was 14 when I started a web-hosting business.</p> <p>Since then I've grown my company, 4D, into a fully fledged co-location and connectivity provider with data centres in London, Surrey and Kent. Here are my top tips for launching a startup business that lasts.</p> <h2>Work 24/7</h2> <p>I left school at 17 to devote more time to the business; being an entrepreneur is a full-time job and if you are serious, you have to forget evenings and weekends or nine to five. Think 24/7 \u2013 or something that is quite near to that.</p> <h2>Think big</h2> <p>By the time I was 21, the business had grown to a six-figure turnover but I realised that most of my revenues were being absorbed by renting space in other suppliers' data centres. This led to the idea of buying one of my own.</p> <p>The only problem was where would I get the money?</p> <p>I thought the business concept might appeal to one or more private investors. So the first step, and with hindsight the most important one, was to prepare a credible business plan. To do this I bought an off-the-shelf package and simply followed the instructions. Step-by-step, the business plan emerged with a financial model which turned out to be remarkably accurate.</p> <p>On the basis of the business plan I was able to convince a private investor to put up the money, not just to acquire the building, but also to finance the growth of the business during the first two to three years following the acquisition of the new premises.</p> <p>The funding of the initial working capital was important because my business plan showed substantial losses until sufficient revenue could be generated to cover the very significant running costs. Unfortunately, the overheads have to be paid from day one, whether you have one or 100 clients.</p> <p>You must have a formal, written business plan, including detailed market analysis, a marketing and sales plan, a financial plan and a realistic cashflow forecast. This becomes the foundation for your business, to be revisited every couple of months and updated and challenged as your business develops and the market changes. In a nutshell: no business plan, no business.</p> <h2>Understand cashflow </h2> <p>The sad fact is that <a href=\"http://intuitglobal.intuit.com/delivery/cms/prod/sites/default/intuit.co.uk-blaze/pdf/Intuit-Report-The-Three-Year-Glitch.pdf\" title=\"\">more than a third of new businesses fail in the first three years </a>and it's rarely because of a bad business concept; it's almost always the result of running out of cash. As well as having working capital to cover early stage losses, it's imperative that you collect on your invoices on the due date. If you don't, you are providing working capital to your customers and unless you are running a bank, you can't afford to do this. If cash is king for a successful business, it's the emperor for the startup. Understand and monitor your financials closely.</p> <h2>Manage the business</h2> <p>Although the technical challenges in running my datacentre business are considerable, I learned early that having effective management processes were as important as a disciplined approach to the finances.</p> <p>This means having operational, technical and finance meetings at least once a month, with a record of follow-up actions. Then there's checking the actions have been done at the beginning of the next meeting. It's a simple but effective way of keeping all aspects of your business under control.</p> <h2>Learn from others</h2> <p>Finally, remember that there is no time to learn how to run a business when you are in the thick of a startup. Learn the basics beforehand from the many good books on the subject and visit sites like <a href=\"http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/home\" title=\"\">Business Link</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/small-business-network\" title=\"\">Guardian Small Business Network.</a></p> <p>Best of all, if at all possible, line-up an experienced mentor who can provide dispassionate advice when required and act as a sounding board when you reach critical stages in the development of your business (try <a href=\"http://www.mentorsme.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Mentorsme.co.uk</a>).</p> <p>One last thought: although my business is now successful and profitable, employing 25 people, being an entrepreneur 13 years on is still nearly a 24/7 job \u2013 and I love it!</p> <p><em>David Barker is technical director of</em><a href=\"http://www.4d-dc.com/\" title=\"\"><em> 4D Data Centres Ltd</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Countries with ageing populations can reap a \"longevity dividend\" with the right measures on healthcare, pensions and legal protection, according to a new UN report published on Monday.</p> <p>But while important progress has been made by many countries in adopting new policies and laws on ageing, more needs to be done to fulfil the potential of older people, said <a href=\"http://www.helpage.org/resources/ageing-in-the-21st-century-a-celebration-and-a-challenge/\" title=\"\">Ageing in the 21st century: a celebration and a challenge.</a></p> <p>In 2000, for the first time, there were more people over the age of 60 than children under five. By 2050, the older generation will be larger than the under-15 population. In just 10 years, the number of older people \u2013 defined as over 60 \u2013 will surpass 1 billion people \u2013 an increase of about 200 million people over the decade.</p> <p>\"The social and economic implications of this phenomenon are profound, extending far beyond the individual older person and the immediate family, touching broader society and the global community in unprecedented ways,\" wrote <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon\" title=\"\">Ban Ki-moon</a>, the UN secretary general, in the report's preface.</p> <p>The report urged governments, international organisations and civil society to commit fully to a concerted global effort to realign policy to the realities of 21st-century demographics. Population ageing \u2013 when older people become a proportionately larger share of the total population \u2013 is happening in all countries, but it is happening fastest in poor countries.</p> <p>Of the 15 countries with more than 10 million older people, seven are in the developing world. Two out of three people aged 60 or older live in developing and emerging economies. By 2050, this will rise to nearly four out of five, according to the report.</p> <p>\"If not addressed promptly, the consequences of these issues are likely to take unprepared countries by surprise,\" said the report. \"In many developing countries with large populations of young people, for example, the challenge is that governments have not put policies and practices in place to support their current older populations or made enough preparations for 2050.\"</p> <p>Declining fertility rates and increasing survival at older ages have led to population ageing. Life expectancy at birth has risen substantially across the world. In 2010-15, life expectancy is 78 in rich countries and 68 in poor countries. By 2045-50, newborns can expect to live to 83 in developed countries and 74 in developing countries.</p> <p>While both older men and women face age discrimination, older women face the cumulative effects of gender discrimination throughout their lives, including less access to education and health, lower earning capacity and limited access to rights to land ownership.</p> <p>Financial security and health are cited as among the most urgent concerns by older people, while meeting those concerns poses acute challenges for governments, particularly at a time of global economic crisis, said the report.</p> <p>\"Social protection floors must be implemented in order to guarantee income security and access to essential health and social services for all older persons and provide a safety net that contributes to the postponement of disability and prevention of impoverishment in old age,\" it said.</p> <p>The report pointed out that only one-third of countries have comprehensive social protection schemes, most of which only cover those in formal employment, or less than half of the economically active population worldwide.</p> <p>The report from the <a href=\"http://www.unfpa.org\" title=\"\">UN Population Fund</a> and <a href=\"http://www.helpage.org/\" title=\"\">HelpAge International</a>, an advocacy group, comes 10 years after the <a href=\"http://social.un.org/index/Ageing/Resources/MadridInternationalPlanofActiononAgeing.aspx\" title=\"\">Madrid international plan of action on ageing</a> \u2013 the first time ageing was linked with human rights.</p> <p>The broad aim of Madrid is to ensure that people are able to age with security and dignity. Madrid remains the sole international instrument on ageing and there is no binding international convention specifically on older people. The Madrid plan noted the contribution older people make to society not just financially through tax payments, but also in ways not measured in economic terms, particularly childcare, with grandparents minding children so parents can work.</p> <p>Some countries have approved national policies on ageing since Madrid, with Brazil passing the law for the rights of older people in 2003. \"It is a specific law which guarantees the rights of older persons,\" said Laura Machado, UN international co-ordinator for the <a href=\"http://www.iagg.info/\" title=\"\">International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics</a>. \"We did have a national policy but, like the Madrid plan, it was a recommendation not an obligation. The law is very important because older persons now say they are respected.\"</p> <p>The law gives priority to older job applicants if they are just as qualified as younger ones, has scrapped the mandatory retirement age of 60, and allows older people to buy half-price tickets for the theatre, the cinema and concerts. Transport is also free for people over 65.</p> <p>Machado said there is a split between rich and poor countries on the need for a legally binding international instrument on ageing along the lines of the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/\" title=\"\">UN convention on discrimination against women</a>.</p> <p>\"It is clear there are two groups with very different positions,\" she said. \"The EU especially does not consider such a convention on older persons necessary, whereas the Latin American bloc wants a legally binding instrument that will pave the way for laws at the state level. It is a very important debate at the UN level.\"</p>",
  "<p>With more than a century's worth of hands-on experience between the four of them, Jack, Stuart, Turtie and C are veterans of the fight against what they see as animal exploitation and cruelty.</p> <p>Over the decades they have taken direct action against the hunting of foxes, otters, ducks and deer and are now determined to do all in their power to disrupt the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/badgers?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">trial badger cull</a>.</p> <p>\"It will be up to each individual to decide what they are prepared to do,\" said C, \"But I'll get between the guns and the badgers if necessary. I think quite a few others will do the same.\"</p> <p>This weekend the four were one of a number of activists out in a <a href=\"http://www.visitforestofdean.co.uk/\" title=\"\">soggy Forest of Dean</a> getting ready to thwart the marksmen.</p> <p>Plans had been afoot to hold a full moon rave in the Gloucestershire forest on what the anti-cull brigade had anticipated could be the first weekend of the shooting.</p> <p>But the opening volleys have yet to be fired and so instead the likes of C and his colleagues spent the weekend preparing: mapping setts and familiarising themselves with the lie of the land so they will be ready when the cull does begin.</p> <p>They have a huge job on their hands. The cull area in Gloucestershire is 116 sq miles (300 sq km), much of it within private land hard to access.</p> <p>But they are not going from a standing start. C and Jack say they sabotaged more than 6,000 traps over six years during the Krebs trial badger cull, which began in the late 90s, and so know much of the area well.</p> <p>On Saturday, they estimate they mapped about 23 sq miles (60 sq km) in the north of the forest, which they are not so familiar with because it was not part of the Krebs cull.</p> <p>Jack admits he suffers from a touch of sciatica and so is not as nimble as he used to be, but fortunately for these veterans it appears that a new generation of activists is joining the fight against the cull.</p> <p>On Sunday, C took out a group of 20 newcomers to the animal rights movement, teaching them how to map the setts, how to spot areas cleared for shooting, tutoring them in the law on trespass, advising them on the sorts of methods they could use \u2013 from setting off rape alarms to blowing vuvuzela horns \u2013 to disrupt the shooting when it starts.</p> <p>\"We've got a large area to cover but we know it well and there are hundreds of new people coming in who want to help,\" said C.</p> <p>Jenny, one of the new generation of activists, spent much of her weekend <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/stop.the.cull\" title=\"\">plastering anti-cull posters on road signs</a>, gates and stiles.</p> <p>A 21-year-old student from Worcestershire, she said this was her first taste of direct action. \"I haven't really been into this sort of thing before but I've read the articles on the science behind the cull and it just doesn't seem to make sense to me. They seem to be killing the badgers to try to stay on the right side of the farmers. It can't be right. What will they do if this doesn't work. Go after the deer? Do they just want to kill all our wildlife?\"</p> <p>This remains a period of phoney war. English Nature <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/17/first-badger-cull-licence-england\" title=\"\">issued the licence for the badger cull</a>, which is intended to help halt the scourge of TB in cattle, in Gloucestershire in mid-September.</p> <p>A second licence for an area in Somerset is expected to be issued any day now.</p> <p>But one of the organisations set up to try to prevent the shooting by taking direct action, <a href=\"http://badger-killers.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Stop the Cull</a>, has suggested the cull may not go ahead this year because farmers in the cull zones are not stumping up the money needed to fund it.</p> <p>They claim some farmers in the cull zone are wavering because they have felt intimidated by people lurking near their farms and do not believe they can be protected by the police. The farmers' union, the NFU, insists its members within the cull zones remain steadfast.</p> <p>The champions of direct action are not the only ones continuing to fight the cull. Almost 140,000 people have <a href=\"http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/38257\" title=\"\">signed a petition</a> against the cull created by the rock star Brian May on the government's website.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://e-activist.com/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=105&amp;ea.campaign.id=16188&amp;s_src=web_pb_hpbb0906012\" title=\"\">Humane Society International</a> is pursuing a complaint against the government with the Bern convention, a European treaty to protect wildlife while the <a href=\"http://www.badger.org.uk/content/groups.asp\" title=\"\">Badger Trust</a> has also pledged to pursue any legal route to challenge culling licences.</p> <p>Those against the cull are taking heart from growing local political unease. The Conservative-led <a href=\"http://www.fdean.gov.uk/nqcontent.cfm?a_id=7966&amp;tt=graphic\" title=\"\">Forest of Dean district council</a> has passed a motion banning badger culling on its land. This is a gesture as it only has a few acres but more significantly is contacting all landowners within its boundary to request them to refuse any culling of badgers.</p> <p>Labour councillor Jackie Fraser, who proposed the motion, said she believed most people in the Forest of Dean were against the cull. \"They think the badger is a much-maligned creature,\" she said.</p> <p>In addition, members of a Gloucestershire county council committee has asked the authority to review its policy of badger culling on its land.</p> <p>Another factor that could affect the cull is the weather. Though badgers do not hibernate, they do lie low during the worst of the winter weather.</p> <p>Jan Rowe, a Gloucestershire farmer who speaks for the NFU on bovine TB, told the Guardian that the ideal time for the six-week cull to have taken place would have been between August and the end of October. He said the cull, which has to take place over a six-week continuous spell, needed to begin by mid-October.</p> <p>Rowe insisted farmers in the cull area were paying up and accused the Stop the Cull campaign of trying to divide and rule by claiming that farmers were wavering. \"I believe and hope the cull will go ahead within the next few weeks,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p></p> <h2>Monday</h2> <h2>Masters Of Money<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>In the final part of this timely series, BBC economics editor Stephanie Flanders urges us to shrug off our shackles and storm the barricades. Or at least asks us to consider whether Karl Marx had a point. The 19th-century German intellectual, of course, argued that while capitalism needed to be swept away, it would collapse by itself in any case. Flanders wonders whether his theories might provide answers to the mess we're now in \u2013 and also attempts to separate his economic analysis from atrocities committed in his name. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Monroe<br>9pm, ITV1</h2> <p>James Nesbitt's brain surgeon/miracle worker/purveyor of witty one-liners returns for a new series of the medical drama. There's a new boss at St Matthews and Bremner (the deadpan Sarah Parish) is back from maternity leave. Monroe, as ever, has a lot of dilemmas that make him stare into a glass of red wine and raise one eyebrow thoughtfully. First up is a young man with a brain condition other doctors deem too risky to operate on \u2013 will Monroe <br>give him a chance under the scalpel? At home, his ex-wife has a new boyfriend and his son unleashes some controversial news. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>Hotel GB<br>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>It's difficult enough to imagine potential viewers \u2013 not to mention participants \u2013 steeling themselves for yet another iteration of the fish-out-of-water reality format.The conceit this time is that some of Channel 4's best-known facces will pretend to staff the titular hotel \u2013 Gordon Ramsay running the restaurant, Mary Portas stewarding the rooms, Kirstie Allsopp serving as concierge, etc. The veneer of higher purpose will also be applied, in the form of training for job-seekers. Andrew Mueller</p> <h2>Threesome<br>9.30pm, Comedy Central</h2> <p>The affable comedy returns for its second series bolstered by a new cast of sitcom heavyweights, with Bill Bailey, Robert Webb and The Inbetweeners' Joe Thomas all lining up to appear. Now that baby Lily has been born, Mitch is going back to school for his maths GCSE so he can start a teacher training course. But there's a whole new world of slang, bullying and a surname easily turned into Penis to deal with. The jokes are never subtle, but there's something about the titular Threesome that's likable enough to make it work. <em>Rebecca Nicholson</em></p> <h2>My Brother, The Murderer<br>10.05pm, More4</h2> <p>This wonderfully touching but strangely truncated 30-minute film follows 30-year-old Natasha Owen Jones, a woman who has spent two decades searching for a brother she has never met. Her brother Morgan was adopted before she was born. Natasha was also later adopted and, while she stayed in the UK, he was taken to the US by his new family. Last year, she finally found him, only to discover that he is serving a 99-year sentence for first degree murder in a Minnesota prison. She travels to the US where she meets Morgan for the first time. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>George H W Bush<br>10.15pm, PBS</h2> <p>Part of a series of documentaries on American presidents, this examination of the ex-CIA director turned national leader advances the suggestion that having taken the low road to power, he was governed by his conscience while in the White House. Some would splutter in incredulity at that, and wonder what there is to say about this morally inert suit-filler other than that he was marginally less appalling than his son. This documentary, however, reveals a complex and contradictory man, whose single term as president between 1988 and 1992 was historically momentous.

First up it's crackers, then teacakes \u2013 marshmallowy Tunnock's-style ones, rather than those hot-cross buns without the cross. Brendan is eerily calm as always: \"He's just a machine, look at him,\" mutters John trying to catch a glimpse of his circuit board. Tempering chocolate in a clammy tent, building Buckingham Palace out of gingerbread, there is nothing these bravehearts won't try to win that title. Nutmeggy joy. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p> <h2>The Paradise<br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Continuing the adaptation of Zola's novel now set in \"England's first department store\", and the staff are still trying to win the admiration of their Wonka-like employer John Moray. A tougher sale is the show's odd tone of period social realism and unmoored fantasy. This week Sam reveals that behind his sales floor patter lurks a ladies' man, while Denise tries to generate publicity for the store with a competition to find a radiant lady to wear one of the shop's promotional flowers: \"Miss Paradise Pinks\". No one would blame you if you kept the receipt. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2>Ian Hislop's Stiff Upper Lip \u2013 An Emotional History Of Britain<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Over three episodes Hislop explores Britain's national character, beginning with how we became known for having a \"stiff upper lip\". Once upon a time, the English (the focus here) were actually known for their displays of emotion \u2013 during the 18th century a cult of sensibility made expressive feeling fashionable for men and women. However, there was also the restraining attitude of politeness, which was to pave the way for a more stoic outlook. As usual, Hislop tells his story in a jaunty style, using lively and \u2013 at times \u2013 unlikely anecdotes. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p> <h2>Cuckoo<br>10pm, BBC3</h2> <p>Ken (gigantic stand-up Greg Davies) holds a meeting to set out a few ground rules now that Cuckoo (SNL alumnus Andy Samberg), his new surprise son-in-law, has nestled himself into the family home. Meanwhile, the family gets set for a \"welcome home\" party for daughter Rachel, where she plans to unveil her tool of a new husband to her friends. Happily, this second episode suggests that there's more legs to this sitcom than merely the mockery of insufferable new age chump-wits, with Davies doing the beleaguered partriarch bit some justice. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>Lillyhammer<br>10pm, BBC4</h2> <p>When this show aired in Norway it was watched by 1/5 of the entire population. It's not going to get such a huge viewership over here, but it's worth noting that it wasn't just Norwegian national pride at play \u2013 this really is something funny and unique. Giovanni is still sticking out like the sorest thumb imaginable: apart from his continual habit of speaking heavily Brooklyn-accented English while all around him speak Norwegian, his attempts at not making any waves have resulted in him getting girlfriend Sigrid pregnant. The Scandinavian medical system proves a foe no wiseguy is prepared to tackle. <em>Phelim O'Neill</em></p> <h2>House Of Lies<br>10pm, Sky Atlantic</h2> <p>Based on Martin Kihn's bestseller, House Of Lies is a smart Don Cheadle-starring US comedy drama with hints of Hustle about it. Part-expos\u00e9 of the dark arts of consultancy, part-Robin Hood vengeance fantasy, it sees Cheadle and his firm of besuited gunslingers concoct scams designed to fleece the 1% whose chicanery plunged America into economic ruin, beginning with fictional megabank Metro Capital. Lots of meta, fourth wall-breaching addresses to camera from Cheadle, if only to explain some of the consultancy terminology. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Wednesday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397246061\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348831613283/Mrs-Biggs-010.jpg\" alt=\"Mrs Biggs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheridan Smith stars in Mrs Biggs, ITV1.

That's a lot of people. In this new three-part series, we see how the locals are using all their ingenuity \"to carve out a home, and build their future\", whether by turning their dwellings into a pub (while avoiding eviction by the local council), or by literally transforming dirt into gold: in an eye-popping sequence, a pair of would-be alchemists turn street sweepings into bling, with the addition of nitric acid and mercury. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Mrs Biggs<br>9pm, ITV1</h2> <p>Sheridan Smith's charming portrayal of Mrs Ronnie Biggs concludes with Charmian adapting to life as a single mother in Melbourne. But when a family tragedy strikes, she has a rethink about what she's doing with her life. While she and the boys are pining for Ronnie, he's working as a roofer and living the high life in Rio. And when he finds out that one of his Brazilian lovers is pregnant, he realises he may have the right to remain in the country legally. Ronnie becomes nothing short of punchable when long-suffering Charmian flies in for a visit. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>Best Possible Taste: The Kenny Everett Story<br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>One of the most divisive figures in a truly polarising decade for comedy, Kenny Everett was nevertheless an 80s superstar, his shrill-voiced, button-pushing schtick proving a hit with viewers. He was also, as the cliche goes with comics, a \"complex character\", and thus worthy of the warts-and-all treatment meted out to the likes of Kenneth Williams. Here Oliver Lansley (Whites) is tasked with channelling Everett's lively spirit, in a bio-drama that shines a light on his closeted homosexuality and battles with the moral decency brigade. <em>Gwilym Mumford</em></p> <h2>Body Of Proof<br>9pm, 5USA</h2> <p>Dr Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) is Quincy in killer heels. A former neurosurgeon married to the job, she lost her licence after a car crash numbed her fingers and she killed someone on the operating table. Now she's a fast-talking Philly medical examiner, a genius who doesn't do things by the book, desperate to get back into her estranged daughter's life. Watching Body Of Proof is the TV equivalent of cooking in mittens, all fat-fingered exposition and fumbled cliches. So, not entirely surprisingly, it's also pretty watchable. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>Perception<br>9pm, Watch</h2> <p>You have to feel sorry for the few crimefighters in US dramas that don't have help from uniquely-skilled eccentric masterminds. Luckily for FBI agent Kate Moretti (Rachael Leigh Cook) she has the option of calling on paranoid schizophrenic professor of neuroscience Dr Daniel Pierce (Eric McCormack). In this debut, Moretti and Pierce investigate the death of a pharmaceutical executive \u2013 along with the hallucinations Pierce's subconscious tends to conjure up. It remains to be seen whether the concept remains fresh, but for now file under \"entertaining romp\". <em>Mark Jones</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Thursday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397246062\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348831922974/Wartime-Farm-010.jpg\" alt=\"Wartime Farm\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'Lumber Jills' Jo Mason and Tracy Anderson in Wartime Farm, BBC2 Photograph: Laura Rawlinson/Lion Television/BBC/Laura Rawlinson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura Rawlinson/Lion Television/BBC/Laura Rawlinson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Wartime Farm<br>8pm, BBC2</h2> <p>It's 1942 and things are tougher than ever for Britain's farmers. Three years of the German blockade have taken their toll and there are shortages of wood, animal feed and fuel. Every scrap of land is turned over to food production \u2013 including parks in London \u2013 while \"Lumber Jills\" are deployed by the Women's Timber Corps to fell trees and \"Bevin Boys\" are sent to coal mines instead of the front. On the farm, Peter converts an ambulance to run on coal gas, while Ruth sets up a food centre for those bombed out of their homes. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p> <h2>Hunted<br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Created by X-Files pensmith Frank Spotnitz and produced by the team behind Spooks, big things are expected from Hunted. Luckily, this opening episode doesn't disappoint, hitting the ground running with assassins, hostages and shootouts from the off. Taking place in the world of industrial espionage, Sam Hunter (Melissa George) finds herself back in active service after a botched mission, while trying to uncover just who betrayed her. While we might not see as action-packed a sequence as the opening scene every week, it's safe to say Hunted is far more than just Bourne on a BBC budget. <em>Mark Jones</em></p> <h2>Homefront<br>9pm, ITV1</h2> <p>This drama series about the wives left behind as their menfolk serve in Afghanistan continues to show promise, without as yet exploring the politics of the conflict - though aspects are bubbling underneath. This week, Louise is incensed when she receives a photo of her hubby, back on leave, in a clinch with a female squaddie, which he insists has been photoshopped. Meanwhile, Paula and Tasha, mother and wife of the slain Matt, continue to lock horns. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2>First Presidential Debate<br>9pm, PBS</h2> <p>Though President Obama may have the edge in recent polls, the 2012 election is still proving tight. Republican candidate Mitt Romney has led a weak campaign, littered with gaffes. Obama will hope to exploit those flaws and no doubt be keen to claim the 47% of Americans that Romney has apparently disowned, but he has to contend with poor job numbers and a struggling economy. The first of three debates took place last night, and is reshown in full here. It focuses on domestic policy, and is held in the swing state of Colorado. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p> <h2>The Judy Garland Show<br>9pm, Sky Arts 2</h2> <p>Repeat showings of the screen legend's 1960s variety series co-hosted by comedian Jerry Van Dyke and including an appearance from her then-ingenue daughter Liza Minnelli. Like most US shows of that era, everyone is overly polite and awkward but it's enjoyable for the nostalgia-paddling in the company of legendary performers like Tony Bennett, Ethel Merman and Peggy Lee. And poignant too to see a fortysomething Garland on the downward slope. Tonight she welcomes former co-star Mickey Rooney and they duet up a storm. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p> <h2>Red Dwarf<br>9.40pm, Dave</h2> <p>Following the 2009 Back To Earth specials, Rimmer, Lister, Cat and Kryten return for a six-part series of new adventures. If that smacks of trying to reinvigorate a franchise best left back in the 20th century, the first, largely moose-gag powered scenes here may give further cause for concern, being just not funny. Gradually, though, things improve as the boys explore an abandoned ship and comic timing reasserts itself. Patchy, but the idea of Rimmer crashing on account of \"self-created malware\" powered by his own resentments suggests that some of the old magic may still be there. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Friday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397246063\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348832140212/Strictly-Come-Dancing-010.jpg\" alt=\"Strictly Come Dancing\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Strictly Come Dancing, Friday night, BBC1, 9pm.

Once more, Tess and Methuselah will be presiding over the cha-cha-cha, as Len, Bruno, Craig, and a new face - the one and only Darcey Bussell - offer \"constructive\" criticism during the first of this weekend's two live shows. Would-be hoofers include Victoria Pendleton, Jerry Hall, Johnny Ball and Sid Owen. There's no elimination this week, so they can all rest easy. For now. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Servants: The True Story Of Life Below the Stairs<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>\"You can't get the help these days\" is a phrase which well described the state of domestic service in Edwardian England, where increasing industrial opportunities for the working classes resulted in numbers of those working in service dropping by around 5,000 a year. In the second part of Dr Pamela Cox's exploration of service, she finds that things downstairs were changing. It was the poorest in society who were drafted in to make up numbers, pulled out of the workhouses, taught household skills, and then whisked off into servitude for middle- and upper-class families. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>QI<br>10pm, BBC2</h2> <p>If there's a winning quality to QI, it's that you can never quite tell who's going to be any good at its blend of wit, recondite knowledge and public house esoterica. It was wonderful, for example, to watch Bill Bailey triumph and Jimmy Carr tank utterly a couple of weeks ago. At times it can seem like a bit of a boys' club, it's true \u2013 but tonight comic Sarah Millican continues to hone her mainstream chops, while other contestants include Mr Victoria Coren, David Mitchell, and the former 80s pop star turned broadcasting vicar Rev Richard Coles. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2>Leeds International Piano Competition 2012: Finalists Story<br>7.30pm, BBC4</h2> <p>This year's contest has been run and won by 24-year-old Italian Federico Colli. This is another chance to hear one of the finalists he defeated, 26-year-old Australian Jayson Gillham. Gillham \u2013 who has won several other prizes, including 2011's Brant International Piano Competition and this year's Royal Overseas League Music Competition \u2013 performs Beethoven's Piano Concerto No 5 in E-flat major. Also included: a brief history of the grand piano. Suzy Klein presents. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>Modern Family<br>8pm, Sky1</h2> <p>First in the fourth season of the madly popular US sitcom. Jay's hoping his birthday will pass without mention but his nightmarish family have other ideas. Ideas to do with fishing, and boats, and potential drowning. And will Gloria choose this happy day to drop her pregnancy bomb on the birthday boy? Meanwhile, Mitchell and Cameron struggle for emotional buoyancy after a failed adoption bid and decide to get a cat. Pity the cat. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p> <h2>Moone Boy<br>9.30pm, Sky1</h2> <p>It's confirmation time for Martin Moone, and he has something of an epiphany during the service: he wants to be one of those cool altar boys. Once he's accepted into the gang, he discovers there's nothing sweet and innocent about his priest-terrorising new friends. Martin soon gets to the top of his profession and gets to serve on Holy Thursday, so starts a strict training regime to make sure he's the best altar boy ever. But when his sister Fidelma joins the choir his parents can't help but wonder what they did wrong to make <br>half their children devout church-goers. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 October 2012, because the preview of the BBC4 programme Leeds International Piano Competition 2012: Finalists Story originally said defeated finalist Jayson Gillham \"performs Beethoven's fifth symphony, the opening bars of which are pretty much the classical world's equivalent of Smoke On The Water\". It was Beethoven's Piano Concerto No 5 in E-flat major that Gillham performed.</p>",

  "<p>The public sector has long been leading the pack when it comes to cutting energy costs and carbon emissions. One of the major drivers put in place by government to encourage local action was a framework of national indicators, which required local authorities to take responsibility for cutting carbon from their own estate. Councils were tasked with reducing per capita CO2 in their areas, reducing fuel poverty and even adapting to climate change.</p> <p>Recent legislation changes have seen this framework scrapped, replaced instead by a voluntary memorandum of understanding between government and the <a href=\"http://www.local.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Local Government Association</a>, and a revision of the Nottingham declaration known as climate local.</p> <p>This change in the regulatory environment has happened in parallel with funding cuts for local authorities, meaning that the business case for carbon reduction has to shout louder to be heard.</p> <p>Despite these changes, the need to take action remains very strong. The financial opportunity for councils is particularly compelling \u2013 rising energy prices mean that the potential savings get larger every year. These savings alone should make public sector finance directors sit up and listen.</p> <p>Since 2001, <a href=\"http://www.carbontrust.com/home\" title=\"\">the Carbon Trust</a> has worked with more than 3,000 public sector bodies, providing them with advice and carbon management services. As a result, these organisations have reported actual savings to date of \u00a3640m, with potential future savings of \u00a32.6bn. Energy costs are being cut, liberating resources for frontline services.</p> <p>The wider impact on local areas and the economy should not be overlooked. The <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Committee on Climate Change</a> recently highlighted the critical role that local authorities have in cutting emissions because of their influence over local buildings, surface transport and waste (which together account for 40% of all UK greenhouse gas emissions).</p> <p>Emissions from these sectors can be cut by 20% by 2020, compared to 2010 levels, and 30% compared to 1990 \u2013 but only if local authorities develop serious, workable, low-carbon plans.</p> <p>There are indications that cutting carbon is slipping down the agenda. The <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/\" title=\"\"> Department for Energy and Climate Change </a>released statistics last week showing that 97% of local authorities reported a rise in greenhouse gas emissions in 2010, compared with 2009, and while this may be related to the weather (2010 was colder than 2009 in the UK), it does highlight the need for action.</p> <p>However, a few local authorities are taking their ambition even further. In 2009, <a href=\"http://www.durham.gov.uk/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Durham county council</a> set a target of cutting emissions by 40% from 1990 levels by 2020, but have since upped that goal to 47%. This is equivalent to taking almost 300,000 cars off the road, or putting cavity and loft insulation in more than 750,000 homes.</p> <p>Through their building and transport planning responsibilities, local authorities have an exciting opportunity to lead on the development of healthier, more efficient urban systems. They can pioneer the production of low-carbon, local energy with district heating, waste to energy, combined heat and power, and renewables.</p> <p>Through their school and housing stewardship responsibilities, they can catalyse the development of better learning and living environments, lower fuel poverty, and more sustainable schools. And through their own action, they can demonstrate the reality of a low carbon economy, as well as tangible cost savings, to local businesses and households.</p> <p><em>Tim Pryce is head of public sector at the </em><a href=\"http://www.carbontrust.com/home\" title=\"\"><em>Carbon Trust</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for more comment, analysis and the </strong><a href=\"http://localgovernmentjobs.guardian.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>latest job vacancies</strong></a></p>",
  "<p>In recent weeks I have attended numerous meetings that used the NHS constitution as a means to describe the health service. For those less familiar with this excellent creed, it includes the statement: \"The NHS belongs to the people.\"</p> <p>While this principle is truly laudable, the daily reality for patients and the public can be very different. Just read about the poor practice on some wards, as reported <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2011/dec/07/mid-staffordshire-total-system-failure\" title=\"\">at Stafford hospital</a>, which its own board did not pick up on.</p> <p>Or, how some NHS boards, faced with difficult decisions and large public attendances at board meetings, spend hours rehearsing so the public sees a smooth performance rather than the tensions and shades of grey that exist, while continuing to make decisions in the private part of their meeting. Take all this in to account and you sense the NHS is a \"public service\" with a long way to go.</p> <p>The NHS provides a public service and is funded through taxpayers' money, so it must be accountable and transparent to the public. Yet too often the public is seen as part of the problem and not part of the solution. This is a situation that has to change \u2013 and rapidly, if the NHS is to survive its next decade of challenges.</p> <p>I believe NHS organisations need to do more to involve patients and the public in how our services are run. There are three key areas where we can do this: involving the public more in key decisions about their health services, involving patients more in managing their care, and encouraging greater involvement from the public in how they improve their health and wellbeing.</p> <p>There have been increased efforts by organisations to see patients as partners in their care. Evidence shows that being engaged as a partner, whether you are acutely or chronically ill, produces faster and more sustainable results. This is important for patients. But it is also business critical for the NHS if it is to provide better quality care and outcomes for less money as healthcare demands grow.</p> <p>When Bupa declared in its famous campaign many years ago, \"The patient will see you now, doctor\", the NHS looked on in envy at the personalised choice it offered its patients. But the NHS is catching up. <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Pages/HomePage.aspx\">NHS Choices</a> has since been introduced, allowing patients to provide feedback on standards of care which is routinely collected and used to make improvements. And the introduction of personal health budgets for patients could be another tool with the power to shift control from doctor to patient.</p> <p>There is no doubt that healthcare issues are complex. But NHS managers and doctors do themselves no favours by their attitude of \"arms around their work, no peeking\". We have to change.</p> <p>There is a huge need for more transparency, honesty and openness about why we need to modernise health services. There is an even bigger need for revealing to the public information about the economics, finances, and costs of health and social care.</p> <p>With the NHS putting a greater emphasis on the health of local populations, there is a tension between tending to the needs of the individual patient versus the needs of the wider community. This brings with it issues about how local NHS organisations manage their resources from a finite pot of money.</p> <p>For this reason, we need to start a dialogue with the public about the case for changing the scope, range and location of health services so that we can continue to fulfil the aims of the NHS constitution to \"provide a comprehensive service, available to all ... based on clinical need, not an individual's ability to pay\".</p> <p>Taking a radically different approach to openness on these matters would not just engage the public in supporting change, it would also enable people to suggest more radical and sustainable solutions than healthcare managers often do.</p> <p>Armed with better information about demand for and costs of healthcare, it should create the right platform for encouraging us to change to healthier lifestyle choices. There is the potential to move the public from \"marching in opposition\" to changes to local services, to \"walking in support\" of them. We could look forward to public board meetings, not fear them.</p> <p>And when Robert Francis unleashes, in his own words, \"a tsunami of anger\" from patients about care standards at Mid-Staffordshire NHS foundation trust early next year, let us turn this into a \"tsunami of opportunity\" and move faster down this path of involving the public in improving the way we provide their care.</p> <p>I believe the underlying culture in the NHS, if not in practice everywhere, is now ripe for that to happen. We just need to go that step further to make it systemic.</p> <p><em>Mike Farrar is chief executive of the </em><a href=\"http://www.nhsconfed.org/Pages/home.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>NHS Confederation</em></a><em>.

  "<p>The question here is \"what should we do differently?\" The answer is: pretty much just about everything. Nationally and internationally, while the scale and pace of climate change are accelerating, meaningful responses are dwindling. Part of our collective paralysis comes from the fact that we struggle to imagine a world with less energy, less consumerism, less annual GDP growth. What will it look like, sound like, feel like? Does it inevitably mean that you should start seeking out your cave on Dartmoor as we speak, and developing a taste for slugs? Of course not.</p> <p>Shortly before the 100 Months campaign began, I was part of initiating an experiment to see what a self-organised response to climate change might look like, one based on rebuilding community, on the belief that what is needed is people, everywhere, making their communities happier, healthier, lower-carbon, and more resilient, in a huge variety of ways.</p> <p>It's called the transition movement, and it has emerged as an idea about the future, an optimistic, practical idea. People are finding that there are people near them who are optimistic and practical too.</p> <p>It's something they can actually do. Actually, it's lots of things they can do ...</p> <p>Transition Bath set up an energy company which has raised \u00a3250,000 in shares from local people. Transition town Totnes' Transition Streets programme has enabled almost 700 local householders to reduce their carbon emissions while rediscovering a sense of community on their streets. Bristol soon sees the launch of the Bristol Pound, the UK's first citywide transition complementary currency. Transition Brixton's Brixton Energy is installing community-owned renewables supported by local people. Check out <a href=\"http://www.transitionnetwork.org/\" title=\"\">transitionnetwork.org</a> to get a sense of the amazing projects under way.</p> <p>At its core, this is about the belief that our best way forward is for communities to build local resilience in order to be able to better face the shocks of the present and the uncertainties of the future, from economic crisis to climate change, seeing increased community resilience as economic development. It's a process of plugging the leaks in our local economies, seeing every leak as a potential new business, new livelihood, new apprenticeship opportunity.</p> <p>Of course we need government responses, and international responses, but all of those will struggle without a vibrant bottom-up movement of ordinary people showing what's possible and how thrilled they are by those possibilities. So although the answer is \"pretty much just about everything\", I would argue that seeing this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for entrepreneurship, vision and action is where our successful navigation of the next 50 months lies.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://transitionculture.org/about/\" title=\"\">Rob Hopkins</a> is the co-founder of the Transition Network</p>",
  "<p>The first thing to do is to realise that there is no quick fix. We need to take a step back to go forward.</p> <p>It is tempting to see the 50-month countdown as a race against time, and the only way to win it is to run as fast as possible. The trouble is that we are paying no attention to the finishing tape, which gets inexorably further and further away. Someone else is writing the rules that govern the rules of the race, and we need to get control of the rule book.</p> <p>So many of the decisions that determine the rate at which the climate clock ticks are taken well beyond democratic control \u2013 in the boardrooms of energy companies and in the banks, which have done so much to bring half the world to the brink of financial ruin.</p> <p>It is no coincidence that the sense of powerlessness over climate change has coincided with an attack on the state, combined with an overweaning influence of the market and profit on social and political life. Money must be brought back under democratic control, and control of the state must be wrested from those whose interest lies in diminishing its democratic potential for reining in the market and acting in the common interest.</p> <p>The changes that have so severely blunted the political and cultural instruments for confronting the climate crisis have been 40 years in the making, and may take half as long again to put right. But better that than spend the next 20 years wasting time on short-term, small-scale gestures that play into the hands of business-as-usual by giving people the sense that \"something is being done\".</p> <p>Political and cultural reconstruction takes time and we are starting almost from scratch. We have been deprived of the language we need \u2013 above all the idea that there is a common good beyond the unco-ordinated actions of millions of self-interested individuals. And collective action in the common good is stymied at every turn by markets and their agents \u2013 the credit ratings agencies \u2013 that exert such a malign and self-serving influence on our political and economic panorama.</p> <p>What does this have to do with climate change? Everything.</p> <p>We need to discard the ideological trappings of an increasingly discredited neo-liberalism \u2013 such as the fetish of consumer choice, or the notion of the small state. The financial tsunami that has caused bankers to fear, depositors to panic, and governments to act reflect an economic system that plays with our future as if it were a number on a roulette wheel. An active eco-state will never be the whole answer to the epic challenge of climate change, but it surely forms a big part of it.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://andrewdobson.com/\" title=\"\">Andrew Dobson</a> is a professor of politics at Keele University</p>"
