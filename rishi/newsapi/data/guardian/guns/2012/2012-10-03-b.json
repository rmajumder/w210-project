Police used batons and teargas to try to disperse the crowds.</p> <p>The day after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad appealed to the market to restore calm, the Grand Bazaar \u2013 the heartbeat of Tehran's economy \u2013 went on strike, with various businesses shutting down and owners gathering in scattered groups chanting anti-government slogans in reaction to the plummeting value of the rial, which has hit an all-time low this week.</p> <p>\"Mahmoud [Ahmadinejad] the traitor \u2026 leave politics,\" shouted some protesters, according to witnesses who spoke to the Guardian. Other slogans were \"Leave Syria alone, instead think of us,\" said opposition website Kaleme.com.</p> <p>Iran's alleged financial and military support for the regime of Bashar al-Assad appears to have infuriated protesters in the wake of the country's worst financial crisis since the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s.</p> <p>Angry protesters and foreign exchange dealers were demonstrating near the bazaar in the south of the capital, where many exchange bureaux are located.</p> <p>\"The Bazaaris shouted 'Allahu Akbar' [God is great] as they closed down their shops in the morning,\" said a witness. \"It's impossible to do business in the current situation.\" Amateur videos posted on YouTube which appeared to have been taken from Wednesday's protests, showed demonstrators encouraging Bazaaris to close down shops in solidarity. Security forces were soon sent to quell the protests.</p> <p>\"They used teargas to disperse demonstrators in Ferdowsi Street and also blocked the streets close to the protests in order to prevent people joining them,\" said another witness, who asked to remain anonymous. \"Some shop windows in that area have been smashed and dustbins set on fire.\" A number of demonstrators had been arrested, according to Kaleme.</p> <p>A bazaar official, Ahmad Karimi Esfahani, denied that the \"turbulences\" were linked to the business owners, claiming said shops were closed for security reasons and not as part of a strike. \"The bazaar will open tomorrow as normal,\" he told the semi-official Ilna news agency. A conservative website, Baztab, described the clashes as \"suspicious\", denying Bazaaris were involved.</p> <p>The devaluation of the rial and soaring prices of staple goods are the latest signs that western sanctions \u2013 targeting the regime's nuclear programme \u2013 and government mismanagement are compounding the country's economic woes.</p> <p>On Wednesday, many foreign exchange dealers and bureaux across the country refused to trade dollars and some currency-monitoring websites refused to announce exchange rates.</p> <p>Some Iranians expressed anger on social networking websites over the national TV blackout of the protests, saying it discussed the European financial crisis with little if any coverage of Tehran's unrest. The authorities were also reported to have jammed signals of the BBC's Persian service as the protest unfolded.</p> <p>The government has failed to bring the rial under control despite several attempts. It has lost 57% of its value in the past three months and 75% in comparison with the end of last year. The dollar is now three times stronger than early last year. The economy minister, Shamseddin Hosseini, said the government planned to \"gather up\" the unofficial currency market in the latest desperate ditch to curb the crisis.</p> <p>On Tuesday Iranian authorities announced they would send security services to calm the market but Wednesday's developments appear to show that the move has backfired.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad was bombarded with questions about the currency crisis on Tuesday as he spoke to reporters in a press conference but the embattled president, who is under fire from his conservative rivals, rejected the suggestion that it was the result of his economic policies or government incompetence.</p> <p>Instead, he blamed the rial's slump on his enemies abroad and opponents at home, saying his government was the victim of a \"psychological war\". Ahmadinejad acknowledged western sanctions have contributed to the crisis.</p> <p>An opinion poll posted on a conservative website, Khabaronline.ir, showed that more than 90% of those participated were not convinced with Ahmadinejad's responses on Tuesday.</p> <p>Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, speaking to elites on Wednesday, said the country was under pressure because \"it did not yield to the demands of tyrannies\".</p> <p>Iran is one of the world's largest oil producers and relies on crude sales as the main source of its the foreign currency reserves. The latest US and EU embargo on the imports of Iranian oil has affected that reserve, sending the rial tailspinning and making the dollar hard to come by.</p> <p>Commenting on Iran's currency slump, the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, said that sanctions could be \"remedied\" swiftly if Tehran were cooperating with the international community to address the questions about its disputed nuclear programme.</p> <p>\"They have made their own government decisions - having nothing to do with the sanctions - that have had an impact on the economic conditions inside of the country,\" Clinton told reporters.</p> <p>\"Of course the sanctions have had an impact as well, but those could be remedied in short order if the Iranian government were willing to work with the P5+1 [the five security council members plus Germany] and the rest of the international community in a sincere manner,\" she added.</p>",
  "<p>Britain has begun tentative talks with China and Russia about setting up a hotline to help prevent cyber-emergencies from spiralling out of control.</p> <p>The discussions are at an early stage but they reflect anxiety from all sides that a calamity in cyberspace, whether deliberate or accidental, could have devastating consequences unless there is a quick and reliable way for senior officials to reach each other.</p> <p>The US has been talking to the Chinese about a similar arrangement and the ideas will be among several raised at an <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=816732682\" title=\"\">international conference on cybersecurity in Hungary</a> on Thursday.</p> <p>The event will involve 600 diplomats from up to 50 countries and is a follow-up to a conference in London last year. One of the aims of the negotiations is to agree rules of behaviour in cyberspace at a time when states have become aware of the potential to attack, steal from and disrupt their enemies online.</p> <p>China and Russia have been arguing for a more restrictive, state-controlled future for the internet and for formal arms-control-type treaties to govern what countries can and cannot do.</p> <p>But they have been challenged by European countries and the US. The UK has said there is no need for treaties and that controls on the internet would restrict economic growth and freedom of speech.</p> <p>Some progress has been made in reconciling the two positions, diplomats say, but the gulf between them is still huge, and the negotiations are continuing at snail's pace.</p> <p>With the cyber arena evolving so quickly, and with the US and the UK saying cybertheft now represents a genuine threat to western economies and national security, the need for a hotline is pressing.</p> <p>\"At the moment, we don't really have sufficient information-sharing arrangements with some countries such as Chinaand the Chinese computer emergency response team,\" said a senior Foreign Office official.</p> <p>\"There isn't a form of crisis communication. If we can build that sort of partnership and relationship then the normative framework develops around that. If you ask for assistance, you get a response. That develops into an obligation to assist. One isn't naive about that, but I don't think the Chinese or the Russians enjoy uncertainty, not knowing who to turn to, who to talk to.\"</p> <p>The official said the existing protocols and procedures were not robust enough for the type of emergencies that could materialise in cyberspace. \"In theory, there are lists of people who to call, but I think they need to be tested and relied upon.\"</p> <p>The foreign secretary, William Hague, and the cabinet secretary, Francis Maude, will be in Budapest for the two-day conference. They will announce that the UK is to establish a new \u00a32m cyberhub at one of country's leading universities, which will provide guidance to the government and companies about where to invest money for initiatives in cyberspace abroad. The money will come from the \u00a3650m set aside for cybersecurity in the strategic defence and security review.</p> <p>The official said talks with China were slow going and that there had not been any fundamental shift in Beijing's position. \"Through initiatives such as its draft code of conduct, [China] has promoted a vision of cyberspace which has got much more sovereignty and government involvement in it. They have got particular points that they want to get across to the international community.\"</p>",
  "<p>International land investors and biofuel producers have taken over land around the world that could feed nearly 1 billion people.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org/en/grow/pressroom/pressrelease/2012-10-04/land-sold-last-decade-could-grow-enough-food-feed-billion-people\">Analysis by Oxfam</a> of several thousand land deals completed in the last decade shows that an area eight times the size of the UK has been left idle by speculators or is being used largely to grow biofuels for US or European vehicles.</p> <p>In a report, published on Thursday, Oxfam says the global land rush is out of control and urges the World Bank to freeze its investments in large-scale land acquisitions to send a strong signal to global investors to stop \"land grabs\".</p> <p>\"More than 60% of investments in agricultural land by foreign investors between 2000 and 2010 were in developing countries with serious hunger problems. But two-thirds of those investors plan to export everything they produce on the land. Nearly 60% of the deals have been to grow crops that can be used for biofuels,\" says the report.</p> <p>Very few, if any, of these land investments benefit local people or help to fight hunger, says Oxfam. \"Instead, the land is either being left idle, as speculators wait for its value to increase \u2026 or it is predominantly used to grow crops for export, often for use as biofuels.\"</p> <p>The bank has tripled its support for land projects to $6bn-$8bn (\u00a33.7bn-\u00a35bn) a year in the last decade, but no data is available on how much goes to acquisitions, or any links between its lending and conflict.</p> <p>Since 2008, says Oxfam, 21 formal complaints have been brought by communities affected by World Bank investments, in which they claim that these have violated their land rights.</p> <p>Oxfam's chief executive, Barbara Stocking, said: \"The rush for land is out of control and some of the world's poorest people are suffering hunger, violence and greater poverty as a result. The World Bank is in a unique position to help stop land grabs becoming one of the biggest scandals of the century.\"</p> <p>She added: \"Investment should be good news for developing countries \u2013 not lead to greater poverty, hunger and hardship.\"</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://landportal.info/landmatrix\" title=\"\">International Land Coalition</a>, 106m hectares (261m acres) of land in developing countries were acquired by foreign investors between 2000 and 2010, sometimes with disastrous results.</p> <p>Nearly 30% of Liberia has been handed out in large-scale concessions in the past five years, and up to 63% of all arable land in Cambodia has been passed over to private companies.</p> <p>Oxfam dismisses the claim made by the World Bank and others that lots of available land is unused and waiting for development. \"It is simply a myth. Most agricultural land deals target quality farmland, particularly land that is irrigated and offers good access to markets.</p> <p>\"It is clear that much of this land was already being used for small-scale farming, pastoralism and other types of natural resource use.\"</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://lnweb90.worldbank.org/oed/oeddoclib.nsf/DocUNIDViewForJavaSearch/B56001EB4A0DCE24852577D6005B5CB8?opendocument\" title=\"\">2010 study by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG)</a> \u2013 the World Bank's official monitoring and evaluation body \u2013 stated that about 30% of bank projects involved involuntary resettlement. The IEG estimated that at any one time, more than 1 million people are affected by involuntary resettlement in active World Bank-financed projects.</p> <p>Oxfam urged the UK government, one of the bank's largest shareholders, to use its influence to persuade it to implement the freeze. \"It can also play a crucial role as president of the G8 next year by putting food and hunger at the heart of the agenda, and addressing land grabs as part of this. Critically, it can also press the EU to reverse biofuels targets \u2013 a key driver of land grabs.\"</p> <p>Stocking said: \"The UK should also show leadership in reversing flawed biofuels targets, which are a main driver for land and are diverting food into fuel.\"</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private lending arm, said: \"IFC does not finance land acquisitions for speculative purposes. We invest in productive agricultural and forestry enterprises that can be land intensive to help provide the food and fibre the world needs. IFC has roughly a $4.85bn portfolio of agri-related investments. Of that, roughly $600m has a land component. Total land holding related to those investments total 0.7m hectares.</p> <p>\"Competition for scarce land resources has spurred rising investment in land. This competition can fuel conflict with existing users. Inevitably, bank group involvement in forestry and agriculture is not without risk, particularly given the fact we are operating in imperfect governance environments. But the total number of complaints received gives no explanation as to their validity.\"</p>",
  "<p>Roberto Mancini said Manchester City had to stop conceding easy goals, Yaya Tour\u00e9 agreed the defensive mistakes had to be cut out. Joe Hart wisely kept his opinions to himself on this occasion, though it was simple for anyone to work out that a team yet to keep a clean sheet this season and conceding at a rate of almost two goals per game would struggle to reach the heights of the last domestic campaign, let alone do justice to themselves in Europe. Hart did his best to achieve a clean sheet, and even the Germans would agree that Hart at his best is truly magnificent, yet in the end City were undone by familiar failings.</p> <p>Once again facing one of the most attacking sides in the Champions League in a group even more difficult than the one they entered as rookies last season, the champions of England really needed to hold out until half-time against the champions of Germany to give themselves any hope of a result that would help atone for the points thrown away so late in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/18/real-madrid-manchester-city-champions-league\" title=\"\">last month's defeat at Real Madrid</a>. They accomplished that target reasonably impressively, for even though they were indebted to Hart for a string of wonderful saves there were chances at the other end that could and perhaps should have been taken.</p> <p>But when the deadlock was finally broken after just over an hour City once again had only themselves to blame. They made a defensive mistake and conceded an easy goal. Jack Rodwell was only on as a substitute following an injury to Javi Garc\u00eda, but under no particular pressure in the middle of his own half he played a pass blind and paid the price. Marco Reus was on to it in a flash, and though Hart had performed miracles all evening even he could not keep this shot out.</p> <p>This was far from the Champions League statement of intent City had been hoping to make, though they can only reflect that but for their inspired goalkeeper the damage could have been much, much worse \u2013 and certainly not retrievable through Mario Balotelli's late penalty. Just reaching the interval on level terms was no mean feat, since few visiting teams will turn up in Manchester with such a bold attacking strategy. Dortmund's plan was clearly to punch holes in the City defence right from the outset with a high-speed yet precise passing game that at its best would bewilder even the most organised of defences, though the longer the home side held firm the more likely it appeared that the Germans would tire and be forced to drop their intensity.</p> <p>Sure enough, Dortmund had slowed up just a little by the mid-point of the first half. They still looked dangerous every time they went forward but in a more conventional sense. They had stopped fizzing around like mustard-coloured fireworks, and City could not only cope with that they could begin to make chances for themselves and did, principally through David Silva's close control and vision. With the game still scoreless, Sergio Ag\u00fcero twice and then Silva himself missed excellent openings to score goals that might have put a different complexion on the game, but as with the defensive mistake, composure eluded them just when it was most needed. Not that City deserved to win this game. They didn't, but a different result might have been possible had Hart's heroics at one end been matched by incisiveness at the other.</p> <p>If City were unlucky not to take the lead on the stroke of the interval, when Silva could not adjust his feet in time to take advantage of Pablo Zabaleta's cross to an unguarded far post, fortune smiled on them seconds later when they were caught with too many men too far up the pitch and Hart again had to dive to prevent a goal when Ilkay G\u00fcndogan looked odds-on to score. That was the only bit of truly naive defending by the home side in the first half, and they got away with it. Maybe Mancini knew what he was doing when he requested his goalkeeper to concentrate on stopping the shots, because that is precisely what he did.</p> <p>Without Hart's saves, City could easily have been two or three goals in arrears by the break and double that amount by the end. The eye-catching Mario G\u00f6tze, in particular, must have wondered what he had to do to score after being foiled again by Hart in the second half, and even the noisy and well-drilled <em>Schwarzgelben</em> support in the stand behind him were probably feeling the same way until Rodwell's game-changing error. Typical City really, even in Europe. They could have been thrashed, they could conceivably have won. What they did instead was lose concentration and leave themselves with an awful lot to do.</p> <p>The penalty allowed a glimmer of hope and a frantic last few minutes but even when the scores had been levelled Hart was still being called upon to make saves in stoppage time. If City barely merited a draw, their outstanding goalkeeper most certainly did. A point is better than nothing, and given their outrageous luck in this game it is still possible City might salvage something from the group, but to do that they must learn to live up to their promises. Not to mention pacify Balotelli and keep an eye on an unused and mutinous-looking Carlos Tevez.</p>",
  "<p>This is a corrected version of an article published on 2 October 2012.</p> <p><br>The number of registered voters in six crucial swing states has failed to rise this year at the same dramatic rate as it did in 2008, despite enormous efforts by both main parties to attract new voters, a Guardian survey has found.</p> <p>Data obtained from the secretary of state's offices in Colorado, Iowa, Florida, Nevada, Ohio and Virginia suggest that voter rolls \u2013 the count of people eligible to vote \u2013 expanded at a far faster pace in 2008 than they have this year. The contrast is particularly pronounced among registered voters identifying themselves as Democratic.</p> <p>In Florida, for example, the total number of registered voters grew by 224,750 between January and July this year \u2013 markedly fewer than the increase of 307,388 recorded during the same period in 2008. Four years ago, the Democratic roll in Florida expanded by a thumping 196,490, yet in the same seven months this year it grew by just 54,394.</p> <p>The Florida Republican party has held relatively steady in the state with its voter count increasing by 56,154 to July this year \u2013 almost identical to the 54,394 recorded in 2008.</p> <p>The Obama campaign has undertaken a massive voter registration drive this election cycle in the battleground states where the race is tightest, Florida included. Local papers in the state have reported that the president's re-election team has delivered 220,000 new registered voters during the 13 months to September.</p> <p>The source of the disparity between the Obama campaign's figures and the official tally of registered Democratic voters surveyed by the Guardian remains unclear. At the same time as new names are added to the voter rolls, old names may be removed, following deaths, relocations or other events.</p> <p>The six states in the Guardian survey are all being bitterly fought over by Obama and his challenger Mitt Romney. Backed by their respective Democratic and Republican parties, both candidates have sought to maximise turnout by running registration drives in an attempt to attract new voters to their cause.</p> <p>In spite of such efforts, the total sizes of the electorate in the swing states surveyed by the Guardian have not increased by anything like the extent they did four years ago. In Iowa, the electoral roll grew by 27,239 in the eight months to August 2008, but by only 1,753 in the same period this year. A similar pattern is recorded in Colorado, Nevada, Ohio and Virginia.</p> <p>Again, the contrast looks particularly stark in Iowa on the Democratic side. The party's count of registered voters increased by 69,301 between January and August 2008, but over the same period this year the party's voter roll actually dropped by more than 45,000.</p> <p>Republicans in Iowa by contrast held relatively steady \u2013 their voter count grew by 7,515 in the first eight months of 2008 and 5,671 in a similar period this year.</p> <p>If previous elections are any indication, however, swing states will see a bump in voter registrations in the final two months before the election. In 2008, the number of registered Democratic voters in Iowa increased by 3,232 in September and 7,076 in October. A spike was also felt in Nevada, where the Democratic roll grew by 32,729 in September and 26,550 in October.</p> <p>Voting rights experts in Florida blamed the relatively slow growth in voter rolls this year on a spate of aggressive legislation coming out of the Republican-controlled state assembly. The laws, which included threats of criminal prosecution for volunteers should they not follow the rules by the letter, had such a chilling effect that several non-partisan organisations suspended their voter registration operations entirely.</p> <p>The League of Women Voters of Florida stopped registration drives for more than a year, until the courts intervened and overturned the new laws on the grounds that they were unconstitutional. The league's president, Deirdre Macnab, said that the Guardian's figures confirmed the pernicious impact of voter suppression laws in the state.</p> <p>\"The voter suppression laws have served to inhibit and repress crucial voices that need to be heard in our elections. They were playing politics with our voting rights,\" she said.</p> <p>Macnab added that the suspension of voter registration drives had a particularly adverse impact on communities that traditionally suffer from low election turnout such as poor people, ethnic minority voters, students, older and disabled people. All those groups tend to lean towards the Democratic party.</p> <p>In Ohio, a classically politically divided state which Obama won in 2008 with just 51.5% of the vote, voter rights activists are reporting low levels of political enthusiasm.</p> <p>Sean Sukys, a volunteer with Rock The Vote in Ohio, which encourages young people to participate in the democratic process, said he had been taken aback by how many people said they didn't care about the election this year.</p> <p>\"It's surprising to me that they'd say they didn't care about the future of the country \u2013 but then America is not the most educated population so maybe it's only to be expected,\" he said.</p> <p>While the decrease in registrations may have something to do with the tone of the election itself, Eric Marshall, manager for legal mobilization for the Lawyers' Committee, cited voting restrictions as an undeniable contributor. </p> <p>\"Our voter registration system is stuck in the 19th century. Unfortunately, the discourse in our democracy right now is more focused on policies that make it hard for certain people to vote,\" he said.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The original version of this article inaccurately characterised the statistics as referring to new voter registrations.</strong></p> <p>It stated that the number of new voter registrations recorded in the early part of 2012 was markedly down compared with the same period during the last presidential race in 2008.</p> <p>In fact, the figures relate to the fluctuations in the total number of people on the voter rolls in the relevant states, as counted by each secretary of state's office responsible for supervising the election. Those voter rolls incorporate the number of new voters registered in any given month, but voters may also leave the rolls through deaths, relocations and other factors.</p> <p>It was incorrect to equate the changes in the voter rolls directly and exclusively to voter registration efforts.</p> <p>The figures do show that the total number of people registered on voter rolls in the six swing states has increased more slowly between January and July this year compared to the same period in 2008.</p>",
  "<p>Presidential campaigns aren't where you look for honest, serious discussion of economic policy. Usually, the candidates confine themselves to slogans; sometimes, as with George W Bush, we also get a moron. But in this election, something very different is going on. For the first time, we are explicitly seeing the effects of America's new political duopoly.</p> <p>Both Obama and Romney are very intelligent men. And yet, both of them are completely avoiding, or being dishonest about, huge economic issues \u2013 even when their opponent is highly vulnerable to attack. Thus, we have the bizarre spectacle of a Republican ex-private equity banker attacking the Democrat on unemployment, while the Democrat argues gamely that if we just give him more time, everything will be fine \u2013 which we all know is not true. Both men say vaguely that they will \"reform Washington\", when neither means it.</p> <p>Neither of them says a serious word about the causes of the financial crisis; the <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/10/01/how-the-government-failed-to-fix-wall-street.html\">lack of prosecution </a>of banks and bankers; <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/next-economy/essay-the-growing-income-gap-in-the-u-s-harms-the-economy-20120927?page=1\">sharply rising inequality</a> in <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/why-education-inequality-persists--and-how-to-fix-it/2012/05/15/gIQAXEIeSU_blog.html\">educational opportunity</a>, income and wealth; energy policy and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/02/us-presidential-debates-global-warming\">global warming</a>; America's <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2012/07/21/americans-suffer-from-third-rate-broadband-at-high-prices/\">competitive lag</a> in broadband infrastructure; the impact of <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1917726,00.html\">industrialized food</a> on healthcare costs; the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/07/28/bush-leaving-next-preside_n_115335.html\">last decade's</a> budget deficits and the resultant national debt; or the large-scale, <a href=\"http://www.converge.org.nz/pirm/nutech.htm\">permanent elimination</a> of millions of less-skilled jobs through both globalization and advances in robotics and artificial intelligence.</p> <p>In a time of <a href=\"http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/alpha-consumer/2012/09/14/americans-continue-to-struggle-post-recession\">pervasive economic insecurity</a>, with declining incomes and high unemployment, four years after a horrific financial crisis, how can all of these questions be successfully ignored by both candidates?</p> <p>As it turns out, their behavior is entirely rational, though for disconcerting reasons. The answer lies in the combined effect of three related forces: America's deepening economic problems; the role now played by money in politics; and the emotions of a scared, increasingly cynical, economically insecure electorate.</p> <p>Since the late 1970s, US politics has been increasingly shaped by the pressures generated by globalization, rising inequality and America's declining competitiveness. As average Americans felt increasing pressures and endured stagnant real wages, they initially responded by working longer hours and going into debt (personal, household debt). But then came politics.</p> <p>Beginning with the Reagan-Carter contest in 1980, Republicans <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steven-conn/whats-the-big-idea_1_b_1927492.html\">started</a> to abandon traditional financial prudence in favor of an increasingly demagogic strategy of blaming government regulation, waste and welfare payments in order to justify tax cuts. Demonization of regulation served the additional purpose of justifying the deregulation of industries such as financial services and energy. Since the Republicans' tax cuts were never accompanied by spending cuts, they not only reduced voters' tax bills, but also stimulated the economy generally.</p> <p>It was unsustainable, of course, but when the Democrats tried counter-arguments based on fiscal prudence and government services, they generally got slaughtered \u2013 as did <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/09/10/how-does-the-current-republican-ticket-compare-to-reaganbush/\"> Carter in 1980</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/107286/romneys-tax-silence\">Mondale in 1984</a>.</p> <p>It worked again for George W Bush, although, of course, he lost the popular vote in 2000 and only became president thanks to an <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2010/12/election_hangover.html\">infamous</a> supreme court decision. But it really did work in 2004, when he trounced Kerry despite the increasingly obvious disasters of the Iraqi occupation.</p> <p>And so, <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/the_rumble/2012/09/clintonomics-and-obamanomics-closer-than-you-think\">starting with</a> Clinton's reduction of capital gains taxes and financial deregulation, the Democrats started making deals with the devil. Clinton, to his credit, still tried to do some progressive things where he could, and the internet revolution allowed him to balance his budget. But the Democrats have, by now, been profoundly reshaped by the oceans of money that dominate US politics.</p> <p>In 2008, Obama could afford to run as the reformer, and perhaps even needed to. But not so in 2012: Obama's economic positions \u2013 not just his actions, but even his public statements and promises \u2013 are the result of triangulating reality, public opinion and money. Obama still needs to get <em>some</em> votes from his base, so he must call for some burden-sharing by the rich. But he cannot be honest about the depth, or the sources, of America's structural economic problems, for two reasons.</p> <p>First, he would be telling much of his blue-collar, minority, unionized and/or less-educated voter base that their skills are obsolete and they are economically doomed. Even in 2008, he might not have been able to get away with that; he certainly can't get away with it now. But second, Obama cannot be honest about the economic damage caused by a criminalized, out-of-control financial sector, nor about other major industries contributing to America's economic problems (energy, telecommunications, industrialized food, pharmaceuticals) \u2013 because he needs their money.</p> <p>As a result, Obama seemingly makes himself unusually vulnerable on the economy. But he can afford to, because Romney cannot take full advantage of Obama's vulnerabilities. Romney, you see, depends <em>even more heavily</em> on the money and support of the financial sector, the wealthy, business and of anti-union, anti-immigrant forces. Romney's only appeal to average Americans is through \"values\" conservatism (religion, opposition to gay marriage, abortion, drugs, immigration, etc), vague complaints about government bureaucracy and, yet again, tax cuts.</p> <p>And so Obama can avoid all the hard issues and yet retain the grudging support of his base simply by proposing modest tax increases on the wealthy, and by supporting the safety net (unemployment benefits, Medicare, social security) that Romney might cut.</p> <p>Voila: an election in which there are a dozen elephants in the room, and neither candidate pays them any notice at all; an election that Obama can win because he's somewhat less bad, somewhat less utterly bankrupt, than the other guy. </p> <p>Welcome to America's new and improved two-party system.</p>",
  "<p>Australian rugby supporters who breathed a sigh of relief when Jonny Wilkinson signalled the end of his England days may be in for a nasty shock. The scourge of the Wallabies in the 2003 World Cup final has indicated he would love to tour with the British and Irish Lions next summer and says he has a score to settle following the Lions' series defeat in 2001.</p> <p>At the age of 33 Wilkinson has been rejuvenated on and off the field since moving to Toulon and feels he still has one last international hurrah in him. As he talked in the sun-drenched French Riviera town of Menton, having paid a ceremonial visit to the grave of the sport's mythical founding father William Webb Ellis, it was clear picking up a Test ball and running with it again held huge appeal.</p> <p>\"There's no way I could say no,\" admitted England's record points-scorer. \"It's such a fabulous thing in terms of what it represents. It doesn't matter where you've come from, it's enormous.\"</p> <p>Having been a central figure in the 2001 series, when his intercepted pass contributed to a Wallaby win in Melbourne, and tasted defeat again in New Zealand in 2005, the World Cup winner also has plenty of personal motivation. \"It is niggling away at me. In 2001 I sat in the changing-room after the third Test and it felt like a World Cup final loss. It's like trying to run a marathon, getting to the 25th mile and someone saying: 'That's it.'\"</p> <p>As yet Warren Gatland, the Lions coach, has not approached him directly but there is a precedent, with the Leicester flanker Neil Back touring in 2005 after ending his England career. The snag for Wilkinson is that the closing stages of the French championship season in early June coincide with the start of the Lions' trek to Hong Kong and Australia. Wilkinson is also well aware others are ahead of him in the queue.</p> <p>\"I'm a 33-year-old player playing in France and enjoying my rugby. I'm not England's mainstay fly-half so there's an element of realism for me,\" he said. \"Selection is out of my control. All I can do is play and see if I fit into their plans.\"</p> <p>Whatever happens, Wilkinson is a happier, less tortured soul nowadays. By his own admission he was worried how he would react to retiring from England duty but has been pleasantly surprised. \"I thought it might kick off another of these terrible cycles of mine when I'd suddenly think: 'What am I going to do' and regret it. Actually, it was the opposite. It gave me a new perspective after what I'd been through a year and a half before; sitting in my hotel room every night, going to bed anxious and not being able to work out what was eating me inside.\"</p> <p>After three rewarding years in Toulon \u2013 \"I absolutely adore this place, it's changed my life\" \u2013 he has, nevertheless, yet to commit to another season in France. He likes the idea of coaching young kickers and has a horror of playing beyond his sell-by date. \"It scares me that someone might turn around and say, 'We'll take him on because he did a few things in the past.' It scares me that might count for more than what I am doing on the field.\"</p> <p>Age also has its drawbacks \u2013 \"Physically I can't train like I did when I was 21\" \u2013 but the old desire still burns. \"Maybe it's because I'm coming towards the end, but I'm finding an extra intensity.\"</p> <p>He was so inspired by watching the Olympics he even dug out his running spikes \u2013 \"I saw myself as Usain Bolt ...\" \u2013 and has also enjoyed studying England's progress from afar, not least the current tussle for the No10 jersey.</p> <p>The 21-year-old Owen Farrell reminds him of his younger self. \"I see that constant battle going on in his head. There's an inner aggression that comes from battling with yourself because you are setting your own expectations.</p> <p>\"He has his own agenda which sets the bar ahead of what his team wants. That kind of ruthless edge is something you can't ignore. You need to harness that.\"</p> <p>If Farrell wants to follow in his predecessor's footsteps, he has little time to waste. The qualifying process for the 2015 tournament kicks off this weekend when Hungary face Bulgaria in Kecskemet in Kecskem\u00e9t and Wilkinson believes England must also gather some momentum this autumn.</p> <p>\"We should really be looking at winning all four of the games. This autumn is going to be massive in terms of starting the ball rolling.\" The trophy bearing Webb Ellis's name is already exerting its relentless pull.</p> <p><em>For all the latest news on Rugby World Cup 2015 in England join The Front Row, the official RWC 2015 ezine, at rugbyworldcup.com/signup</em></p>",
  "<p>On a night when Manchester City never looked comfortable, Mario Balotelli showed some composure when it mattered most to convert a 90th-minute penalty that provided Roberto Mancini and his players with a Champions League lifeline. It was harsh in the extreme on a vibrant and free-flowing Borussia Dortmund side who outplayed their opponents for long periods only to come up against a goalkeeper in inspired form and a referee that City should be thanking for giving them a break they never deserved.</p> <p>Time and again Joe Hart came to City's rescue with an outstanding display of goalkeeping that spared the Premier League champions from a hiding and kept them in an absorbing game that Dortmund should have put to bed long before Balotelli took centre stage. Leading through Marco Reus's second-half strike, which followed a bad mistake by the substitute Jack Rodwell, Dortmund were in total control and it seemed a matter of time before they added a second goal.</p> <p>Hart, in keeping with everything that had gone before, denied Reus and Ilkay G\u00fcndogan with fine saves but the golden opportunity for Dortmund to increase their advantage and kill off City fell to Robert Lewandowski in the 76th minute. G\u00fcndogan nutmegged Ga\u00ebl Clichy on the touchline before delivering a wonderful cross that exposed City's fragile defence yet again and implored Lewandowski to convert only for the Poland forward to inexplicably steer the ball wide with the outside of his boot.</p> <p>It was a huge slice of good fortune for City and another followed when Pavel Kralovec, the Czech referee, pointed to the spot and adjudged that Neven Subotic had handled Sergio Ag\u00fcero's shot. It seemed more a case of ball to hand rather than hand to ball, with Subotic hard pushed to get out of the way of Ag\u00fcero's hooked effort on the corner of the six-yard box, but Kralovec deemed otherwise and Balotelli, an 81st-minute substitute, did the rest, nonchalantly rolling the ball into the corner of the net.</p> <p>Although Dortmund complained bitterly at the award of the penalty, they still found the energy to summon one more attack that could easily have led to a winner. Lewandowski once again pulled the trigger and this time the striker found his range, but Hart, for the umpteenth time, produced a flying save to preserve the point that keeps City's faint hopes alive of reaching the knockout stages.</p> <p>They will, however, have to play with much more conviction than they showed here if they are to have any chance of finishing ahead of Dortmund or Real Madrid in Group D. Although City had their opportunities, most notably through Ag\u00fcero, who could have had a first-half hat-trick but was frustrated by another excellent goalkeeping display, from Dortmund's Roman Weidenfeller, the hosts were vulnerable whenever Dortmund attacked and it was alarming to see the German side cut through their rearguard with such ease.</p> <p>Yaya Tour\u00e9 and Rodwell, who replaced Javi Garc\u00eda, offered little midfield protection while further back Matija Nastasic, once again preferred to Joleon Lescott in central defence, and Vincent Kompany never instilled confidence. City have now conceded 16 goals in nine games this season and, in truth, they never looked like keeping a first clean sheet of the campaign here. With Lewandowski a handful up front and Dortmund's attacking midfield trio of Reus, Mario G\u00f6tze and Jakub Blaszczykowski willing runners, the German champions had a field day.</p> <p>City's best moments were in the opening half, when David Silva started brightly, creating an early chance for Ag\u00fcero only for Weidenfeller to block with his legs. The same two City players combined later in the first half but Weidenfeller thwarted Ag\u00fcero in similar fashion and he made it a hat-trick of saves when he stretched every sinew to tip the striker's dipping 20-yard effort over the bar in the 35th minute. By that point Rodwell was on for Garc\u00eda, who departed with a thigh strain, and Dortmund had long signalled their intent with a number of slick counter attacks.</p> <p>G\u00f6tze was experiencing a similar night to Ag\u00fcero in front of goal. The Germany international saw an 11th-minute shot tipped on to the upright by Hart, had another effort blocked by the City keeper later in the half and, seconds later, saw a stinging shot brilliantly flicked on to the crossbar by a player performing at the top of his game. There was still time for one more Dortmund attack before the half-time whistle and it should have ended in a goal but G\u00fcndogan's close-range shot from Lewandowski's centre ended with Hart getting his body in the way.</p> <p>Although Hart turned another G\u00f6tze chance behind early in the second half, after Blaszczykowski and Lukasz Piszczek had neatly combined on the right, there was nothing he could do when Reus intercepted the blind pass Rodwell attempted to play to Nastasic and drove into the area before shooting across the City keeper.</p> <p>It should have been game over for City later on but Lewandowki's profligacy left the door ajar for Mancini's players and Balotelli took full advantage to leave the Dortmund players crestfallen at the end.</p>",
  "<p>Arsenal made a couple of late substitutions in this match, but that was no minor courtesy to the players introduced. It brought a welcome pause for the hosts as they held on to a 2-1 lead. A more luxurious moment came in stoppage time when the substitute Aaron Ramsey added a further goal with a very neat shot.</p> <p>Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, serving a touchline ban, sat in the stands, leaving his assistant manager, Steve Bould, in charge. The latter saw a reaction to defeat by Chelsea last weekend. \"It was tough, they made it tough for us. Without being fantastic,\" he said, \"we got back on track before the weekend, which will be a tough game [at West Ham].\"</p> <p>There is something incongruous about thinking that a Champions League game could be some sort of warm-up for the Premier League. But, given their record, English clubs do have some cause to expect that a berth in the knockout phase is all but inevitable. Arsenal are more at ease in this competition than in domestic fixtures Victory was deserved here.</p> <p>Olympiakos had shown endeavour but have now been beaten in both group games. Arsenal's concerns are marginal by comparison but they have failed to keep a clean sheet in any of their past six matches.</p> <p>Arsenal's command, to put it kindly, fluctuated against Olympiakos. They took the lead in the 42nd minute with a low drive by the dynamic Gervinho from the edge of the penalty area after a tackle by Mikel Arteta had brought the opportunity. Just before the interval, Olympiakos equalised when Kostas Mitroglou got free of Laurent Koscielny to head home a delivery from Leandro.</p> <p>Although there has been a partial overhaul of the team, Arsenal sometimes look as if the European scene is the setting in which they are more likely to flourish, even if Olympiakos did check them in the opening 45 minutes.</p> <p>Thomas Vermaelen, the Arsenal captain, was disappointed by his side's performance before half-time. \"The second half was better \u2013 in the first half we were sloppy sometimes with the passing, we lost a lot of balls,\" the centre-back said. \"We started well but the first half was not&#xa0;great.\"</p> <p>It is unlikely that Wenger could have altered this contest immediately if he had been allowed his place in the technical area. His judgment, all the same, was felt to a degree. In the alterations to the lineup following the defeat here by Chelsea, there was no place for the centre-half Per Mertesacker. Bould, though, explained that the player has been unwell.</p> <p>No one should suppose Wenger is a detached intellectual rather than an intensely engaged manager. It must have been agonising when there were no instructions to be given. The Frenchman would have yearned to communicate when the visitors might have scored in the 35th minute. Paul Machado was in position to connect with a cross from Jos\u00e9 Holebas, but merely lifted it over the bar.</p> <p>Arsenal were busy enough but Olympiakos, already beaten in the group by visiting Schalke, were ready to take the risk of committing men into attack. The hosts had to deal with that increased purpose if this occasion was not to introduce anxiety to Arsenal's expectation of a simple advance to the knockout&#xa0;stage.</p> <p>There can have been few neutrals among the onlookers but this match could have been regarded as a pleasure by anyone who cared for excitement and unpredictability. The home supporters, however, took a more intense satisfaction as a more forceful side claimed a 2-1 lead.</p> <p>There was a mixture of insistence and quality when Gervinho linked with Santi Cazorla before the latter's cross was blocked and the ball ran back for him to set up Lukas Podolski for a goal. The real trial for Arsenal, then, had been the spasmodic nature of their work. Compliments were due to Olympiakos for their commitment. Excuses could be made for the fact that Arsenal continue to be a work in progress after some recasting of the squad in a summer that included Robin van Persie leaving for Old Trafford.</p> <p>Olympiakos would have reckoned that a consecutive loss in the group would be irreparable, but not many visiting teams would have challenged Arsenal with such vigour on this ground.</p> <p>Wenger's men, at times, were still striving just to make sure that Olympiakos were kept at bay. Instead of calming a match that Arsenal must have expected to win with some ease, there was a need to marshall forces and protect the&#xa0;advantage.</p> <p>On this night, negotiating the stretch of the path towards the last 16 was full of jeopardy and, indeed, fascination.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> The reigning champions of England against the reigning champions of Germany? Yes please. Not least when the other match in Group E pits the reigning champions of Spain against their Dutch counterparts. Let's face it, you'd need a heart of stone not to be excited by a Champions League group featuring so many genuine Champions League contenders and Ajax.</p> <p>Having failed to qualify from a decidedly difficult group last season, Manchester City's efforts to go one better this time round got off to a shaky start when they <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/18/real-madrid-manchester-city-champions-league\">threw away a 2-1 lead against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu</a>. In such a horrible group, they'll be eager to get three points on the board against Borussia Dortmund this evening. The German outfit needed <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/18/borussia-dortmund-ajax-champions-league\">a late goal from Robert Lewandowski to edge past Ajax at the Westfalenstadion</a> in their opening match and they'll be confident of winning another point or three tonight as they take on a defensively suspect team that has failed to keep a clean sheet in any of its nine matches to date this season.</p> <p>Financially prudent after years of behind-the-scenes chaos and with a recent habit of producing the kind of end-of-year accounts that would bring a smile to the chops of even the most stony-faced bean-counter, Borussia Dortmund couldn't be less like Manchester City off the field of play. But while extreme caution is the watchword behind the scenes, their manager Jurgen Klopp has ensured that the club's on-field ethos is anything but. Their eye-pleasing, swashbuckling style has served them well on the domestic front over the past two seasons, but not so well in Europe. In last season's Champions League they finished bottom of their group, hopelessly adrift of the more canny and experienced Arsenal, Marseille and Olympiakos, but tonight's encounter should provide some indication of how far both they and City have evolved in their bids to establish themselves as more mature forces to be reckoned with in Europe.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Some stuff you might like:</strong> My colleague Marcus Christenson may be a Swede but he's no turnip, so if he writes a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/oct/03/borussia-dortmund-manchester-city-champions-league\">686-word primer on Borussia Dortmund and their hopes for this season's Champions League</a>, you could do a lot worse with your time than read it.</p> <p>Alternatively, you can read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/02/manchester-city-borussia-dortmund-champions-league\">Paul Wilson's match preview</a>, which also features video footage of Roberto Mancini's press conference from the Etihad Stadium yesterday.</p> <p>And if for some reason you're not yet a subscriber (apart from the reason that you were a subscriber but can no longer stand the sound of it), you can listen to our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/series/footballweekly\">Football Weekly podcast here</a>, then subscribe to it on iTunes.

In front of them, David Silva and Samir Nasri will play on the right and left of Sergio Aguero, who'll be buzzing around in his own inimitable way behind lone frontman Edin Dzeko.</p> <p><strong>How Borussia Dortmund will line up:</strong> With seven Germans, three Poles and a Serb, that's how. They too will almost certainly play a 4-2-3-1, with Messrs Piszczek, Subotic, Hummels and Schmeizer lining up from right to left in front of goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller. Ilkay Gundogan and Sven Bender will protect the back four, while Jakub Blaszczykowski, Mario Gotze and Marco Reus will form an intimidating attacking trio behind Robert Lewandowski.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Happy birthday</strong> to Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who turned 32 today.

Sergio Aguero goes down in the Dortmund penalty area under a challenge from Mario Gotze, but no penalty is forthcoming. Moments later, Vincent Kompany puts the heart crossways in Joe Hart with a less than assured backpass.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Dortmund attack down the right flank courtesy of Mario Gotze, who appears to have taken up a position on that wing instead of Jakub Blaszczykowski, who's tucked in behind his compatriot Robert Lewandowski.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Manchester City are wearing their customary home attire of light blue shirts, white shorts and light blue socks. Dortmunds players are kitted out in yellow shirts with black (or is it navy?) stripes, black (or is it navy?) shorts and yellow socks with black (or is it navy?) hoops.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Dortmund attack down the right flank again, with full-back Lukasz Piszczk lofting a cross into the centre. Robert Lewandowski wins the aeriel duel but is unable to control his header and sends the ball high and wide.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Sergio Aguero takes advantage of the high line being played by Dortmund's defence to get in behind Neven Subotic on the edge of the penalty area and latch on to a through ball from David Silva. His shot is blocked by Weidenfeller, but the ball breaks to Silva, who tees up Zabaleta this time. He snatches at the ball and shoots it high over the crossbar.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Borussia Dortmund take on City down the right flank again, with Robert Lewandowski teeing up Mario Gotze. He unleashes a scorching drive from about 18 yards, which Joe Hart tips wide via his right post. Nothing comes from the ensuing corner and Manchester City clear their lines.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Zabaleta gets on the end of a beautifully angled David Silva pass on the right-hand side of the Dortmund penalty area and tries to shimmy and wriggle his way towards goal from the goal-line. Referee Pavel Kralovec spots an infringement and penalises the Manchester City right-back.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> With 15 minutes gone, the rain is pouring down there's been no let-up in the furious pace at which this game is being played. It's splendidly entertaining stuff, but Manchester City fans will be concerned by the manner in which their team is being forced to play on the back foot at home in such an important game. The early stats show they're dominating possession 62%-38%, but that's not the way it look in terms of chances created and threats posed.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> On the edge of the final third, David Silva tries to cut in from the right-hand touchline but concedes a throw-in under pressure from Gotze.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Perhaps it's because of the rain, which is bucketing down, but the game has got a lot more scrappy in recent minutes, with lots of congestion and general faff in the middle third of the field. The camera cuts to Alex Ferguson, who is present this evening, just as the Manchester United manager cuts loose with a massive yawn.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Manchester City try to play the ball through the centre and Sergio Aguero does well to lay it off to a team-mate while surrounded by four opposition players.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Manchester City try to play it out from the back and win a free-kick just inside the Dortmund half for an Ilkay Gundogan foul. The Dortmund defensive midfielder gets a ticking-off from the referee for kicking the ball away, but is spared a yellow card.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Edin Dzeko times his run perfectly to split central defenders Subotic and Hummels and get on the end of a Silva pass from deep and shank his effort over the bar. Even if he'd scored it wouldn't have couldn't as the linesman had flagged, incorrectly, for offside.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Silva picks out Aguero with a splendid pass down the inside right channel. The Argentinian shoots across the face of goal, bringing a decent save out of Roman Weidenfeller.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Play switches to the other end of the field, where a free-kick swung into the Manchester City penalty area by Marco Reus briefly causes pandemonium. Good defending from Zabaleta, followed by the intervention of Joe Hart, allows City to clear their lines.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> There's a big shout for hand-ball as Edin Dzeko tries to get the better of Marco Reus on the right flank, deep in Dortmund territory. No free-kick is forthcoming.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> Javi Garcia goes down clutching his thigh and calls for medical assistance. He'll catch his death of cold on that wet grass.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> Manchester City substitution: Jack Rodwell on, Javi Garcia off.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> David Silva shimmies this way and that before picking out Sergio Aguero a couple of yards outside the Dortmund penalty area. He looks up and shoots on sight, forcing Roman Wedienfeller to tip the ball over the bar for a corner, from which Dortmund break on the counter and win a corner of their own.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Marco Reus takes the corner, City fail to clear properly and a bizarre attempt to hack the ball out of defence by David Silva results in it dropping kindly for Subotic. He shoots diagonally from right to left and his low drive fizzes a couple of feet past Joe Hart's right post.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp likened his side's style of play to Arsenal yesterday and the similarities become apparent here. With four or five men committed forward, they try a pass too many and attempt to walk the ball into the net when a more direct approach to goal might have yielded a score.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Wonderful, lightning fast football from Dortmund results in Mario Gotze being left shaking his head in disbelief after being denied by Joe Hart. The German winger had latched on to a return pass from Robert Lewandowski and looked set to put his side ahead, only for Hart to charge off his line, narrow the angle and deny him from close range.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Dortmund win a free-kick not too far inside the Manchester City half. Reus attempts to play the ball into the penalty area, but his delivery is poor. The ball is cleared, makes its way to Jakub Blaszczykowski on the right flank and he whips in a marvellous cross that somehow manages to evade Gotze and Lewandowski loitering on the edge of the six-yard box.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> City go close again. Zabaleta loops a cross into the Dortmund penalty area from the left. It's a fraction too high for Dzeko and drops just behind the big striker, where David Silva tries to kung-fu kick the ball past Weidenfeller from six yards, but succeeds only in slashing it over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>45+1 min:</strong> Joe Hart is left horribly exposed when Ilkay Gundogan finds himself unmarked in front of goal with the ball bouncing kindly for him and only the goalkeeper to beat. The Dortmund midfielder pulls the trigger, but Hart keeps the scoreboard operator idle with another splendid save from point-blank range.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> It may be scoreless, but this match has been anything but dull. Chances have gone a begging for both sides, but both goalkeepers deserve credit for putting in superb shifts thus far.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>SB Tang writes:</strong> \"I dunno why everyone, including it seems Herr Klopp, compare Dortmund with Arsenal and Barca,\" he says. \"The comparison's only valid insofar as all three sides practise attractive, technically proficient football. In terms of playing style, Dortmund are completely different to Arsenal and Barca. The latter two aim to dominate possession and territory, whereas Dortmund are a speedy, vertical, counter-attacking side who don't mind enjoying a minority of the possession because they can smash the opposition with a quick, incisive counter-attacking move consisting of approximately five passes or less (instead of the double-digit numbers favoured by Barca and Arsenal).\"</p> <p>And here's the proof: \"The first half of this match has amply demonstrated that point,\" he says, adjusting the hood of his anorak. \"Dortmund enjoyed only 37 per cent of possession but managed more shots on target (5 to 4) and more total shots (10 to 6). As armchair viewers I reckon we can all anecdotally agree that they're had more chances and of a better quality than City.\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>Second half:</strong> Borussia Dortmund get the second half underway. There was an interesting vignette just before they did so, when the Manchester City players were shown pausing at the mouth of the tunnel before returning to the pitch. It turns out they were waiting for Yaya Toure, who was delayed leaving the dressing room. Perhaps he was looking for his mojo, which seems to have deserted him thus far tonight. He's had a poor game by his own imperious standards.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> B\u0142aszczykowski tries his luck with a shot from distance, but doesn't trouble Joe Hart.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Weiderfeller spreads his arms in exasperation as he waits to take a goal-kick, as if to implore one of his team-mates to make a move so he can kick it their way. Possibly in protest at their lack of enthusiasm, he eventually punts it down the right flank and out of play.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> With Dortmund attacking City on the break again, Pablo Zabaleta performs heroics to get back and help out his centre-halves with a beautifully timed tackle on Marco Reus on the edge of the City penalty area. He's been everywhere tonight.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Another save by Joe Hart, who flings himself to his right to tip yet another rasping effort from Mario Gotze around the post for a corner, from which nothing comes.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> Zabaleta sends a cross in from the right and Weidenfeller darts of his line to punch clear, but misses. From the ensuing scramble, City win a corner, but nothing comes of it and Dortmund clear.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> Manchester City substitution: Aleksandr Kolarov on, Samir Nasri off.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Manchester City switch to a back three, with Vincent Kompany playing centre-back and Gael Clichy and Matija Nastasic to his left and right. Zabaleta and Kolarov are playing wing backs.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Manchester City 0-1 Borussia Dortmund (Reus 60)</strong> Jack Rodwell is left hanging his head in shame after playing a loose pass without looking where it was going in midfield. Marco Reus sprints on to it, gallops through on goal like a rugby player greedily accepting an interception and flicks the ball past Joe Hart and into the bottom left-hand corner. Hart got a hand to the ball, but was unable to keep it out.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Joe Hart is forced into action once again as Reus latches on to a ball played through the City defence and tries his luck with a low diagonal effort from right to left. Hart dashes off his line and block the shot. I think it's probably fair to say that City's tactic of playing with a back three is not working.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>67 min:</strong> Ilkay Gundogan tries his luck with a curling effort from the edge of the penalty area. City are forced to rely on Joe Hart to get them out of jail again and he does exactly that, leaping high to his left to tip the ball over the bar for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Manchester City earn some much-needed respite by winning themselves a corner. Nothing comes of it and Dortmund clear.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Kolorav puts Aguero through on goal with a perfectly weighted through-ball down the inside left. Weidenfeller dashes off his line to narrow the angle, so the Argentinian attempts to square the ball to Edin Dzeko. His pass is intercepted by Neven Subotic, who plays it out of defence.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Borussia Dortmund substitution:Mats Hummels off, Felipe Santana on. Borussia Dortmund booking from 10 minutes ago that I haven't got around to mentioning yet: Jakub Blaszczykowski.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> On the touchline, Mario Balotelli has been instructed to peel off his tracksuit and prepare for action.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> With the outside of his right foot, Robert Lewandowski misses one of the easiest chances he'll ever be presented with. Latching on to a beautifully curled cross into his path from Ilkay Gundogan on the right flank and with Joe Hart at his mercy, he scuffed the ball wide of the left upright when scoring looked a far easier option. That's a dreadful miss.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Ilkay Gundogan goes down as if shot in the back under a challenge from Pablo Zabaleta and there's a minor skirmish between assorted players from both teams when City, quite correctly, decline to put the ball out of play so he can receive medical attention.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Manchester City substitution: Gael Clichy off, Mario Balotelli on. That's the last of City's three substitutes on now. Borussia Dortmund substitution: Ilkay Gundogan off, Kevin Grosskreutz on.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> City are starting to look a bit clueless and out of ideas. They pretty much matched Borussia Dortmund chance for chance in the first half but have created very little since the break.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Nastasic lumps the ball forward into the Dortmund box from deep, trying to pick out Edin Dzeko. The visitors clear.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Yaya Toure is booked for a foul on Mario Gotze.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Good work by City, who create a decent chance after good link-up play by Mario Balotelli and Edin Dzeko down the right. Dzeko crosses into a crowded penalty area and picks out Sergio Aguero, but his on-target header is saved by Weidenfeller.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Penalty for Manchester City. Subotic is penalised for handball. On first view it looks a decidedly strange decision and one which quite a few referees might not have given.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Manchester City 1-1 Borussia Dortmund (Balotelli 89pen)</strong> After completely ignoring Wedienfeller jabbering in his ear as he waited to take the spot-kick, Mario Balotelli takes his run-up, stops and then waits for the goalkeeper to dive towards one corner before nonchalantly rolling the ball into the other. He wheels way doing a yap-yap-yap lobster impression with one hand.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> First Reus and then Lewandowski go close for Borussia Dortmund. The latter's effort forces another fine save out of Joe Hart. There'll be four minutes of injury time and this match could still go either way.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>90+1 min:</strong> So, that penalty - having seen a replay I can confirm it was a shocking decision. Subotic was contesting the ball with Aguero, it bounced up, hit his arm and he was judged to have controlled it with his hand.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>90+3 min:</strong> A foul by the substitute Santana gifts Manchester City a free-kick within shooting range for Kolarov, wide on the right. His effort is poor and fails to clear the first man.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>Peep! Peep! <em>Peeeeeeep</em>!</strong> Referee Karlovec blows for full-time and draws the curtain down on a wonderfully entertaining match. I don't think it's unfair to say that Manchester City escaped from jail there, having been soundly thrashed in the second half. But for a generous decision from the referee, the heroics of their goalkeeper and the profligacy of Borussia Dortmund in front of goal, they could easily have lost by three or four. Elsewhere in this group, Real Madrid have seen off Ajax 4-1 in Amsterdam to go top of the group with six points ahead of Dortmund (four points) in second and City (one point) in third.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>Full-time:</strong> Arsenal were given a decent test by a good Olympiakos side. They were skittish in the first half and the Greeks fully deserved to go in level but Arsenal improved in the second period and played with greater dynamism and creativity.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Arsenal 3-1 Olympiakos (Ramsey 90+3')</strong> Perfect simplicity! Mannone booted one long, Giroud flicked it on smartly, and Ramsey raced through to clip it daintily over the keeper.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>90+2 min:</strong> Ouch! That looks serious for Coquelin, who slid in to win a tackle well but then, as he got up, appeared to pull something in his calf and collapsed back to the ground.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> Montpellier have equalised in the last minute at Schalke, meaning Arsenal will have a nice gap at the top of the group provided they don't slip up at the death here.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Superb play by Arsenal, with Cazorla and Ramsey combining brilliantly on the left before Cazorla pulls the ball into the box and Giroud smashes it goalward .. only to be denied by Siovas, who made a saving block.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Jenkison has had a fine game and he's trying to underline that with an assist: he's sent in three tempting crosses from the right in the last couple of minutes, all dealt with smartly by the defence.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Arsenal hogging possession now as they seek to see this one out. \"I'm convinced Gervinho is actually a twin, and they subtly switch with each other over the course of the game,\" blarts Harry Crane. \"One minute he'll be brilliant, the next he'll be dire, if he could sort out his first touch and find some consistency he could be a real top player and pivotal in an Arsenal title challenge.\" I hear you. Although in addition to his touch, he could do with sharpening his decision-making too.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Walcott hurtles down the right and pings in a delightful cross that Giroud does well to meet at the near post ahead of his marker. Good save by the keeper.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Abdoun races down the left behind Jenkinson. His spanks in a decent cross but Mannone, who has been jittery on several occasions tonight, intercepts well.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Arsenal substitutions: To a tremendous ovation Gervinho leaves the pitch, as does Podolski. Giroud and Ramsey enter the fray.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Chants of \"Theo, Theo, Theo\" go up as popular TV personality Theo Paphitis arrives to distribute toffee and beetroot in the crowd. Either that, or because Theo Walcott has just scorched down the right and put in a testing cross.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Cute ball by Vermaelen ... followed by a preposterously awful touch by Gervinho, who wellies it out of play whilst attempting to trap it.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Arsenal relieve the pressure that had been mounting with a brilliant counterattack. After a lovely zippy move, Walcott was set free down the right and he fired a low cross into the six-yard box, where Megyeri pounced just as the in-rushing Vermaelen seemed set to convert!</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Olympiakos change: Diakit\u00e9 off, Ibagaza on. Another attacking switch. They know they can get something from this game.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Machado wafts a shot way wide from the edge of the box. But the threat from Olympiakos is growing. Arsenal could do with a third goal here ...</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Arsenal change: Oxlade-Chamberlain off, Walcott on.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Fuster swivels to make space for a shot, then tonks a low one at Mannone from 25 yards. Comfortably held by the keeper.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Olympiakos change Abdoun on, Greco off. Abdoun is a much more attacking wideman than the departed Greco.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>67 min:</strong> Mannone inexplicably allows the ball to roll out for a corner of his legs. Arsenal then let the Greeks take the corner quickly and are fortunate that no serious chance results.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Excellent defending by Holebas to recover and thwart Oxladce-Chamblerain after the winger had dashed past him down the right to latch on to a beautiful pass from the increasingly influential Cazorla. Meanwhile, the other match in this group, between Schalke are beating Montpellier 2-1.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Contreras rightly booked for clattering into Oxlade-Chamberlain after the youngster had outwitted him down the right. Arteta hoists in the freekick ... and Koscielny nods over from six yards! That's a wretched miss!</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Cunning interplay between Machado and Metroglou down the right before the latter curls a reasonable effort wide from the corner of the box.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Unlike in the first half, Arsenal are showing no signs of dozing off after their goal. Gervinho, who is suddenly excellent, again pulls strings cleverly at the edge of the box before playing in Cazorla, who is dispossessed at the last by Contreras.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Arsenal 2-1 Olympiakos (Podolski 56')</strong> Nice goal! And Gervinho's role in its creation was crucial. He swapped cutting passes with Cazrola and then, when the ball came back to him after his initial cross was blocked, he showed astuteness to pull it back for Podolski, whose low shot from 10 yards found its way past the keeper!</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Olympiakos take a quick freekick and work a shooting opportunity for Metroglou, who lets fly from 25 yards. Well struck but wide.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Chance for Arsenal! Gibbs did well again down the left before feeding Podolski, who didn't do so well. But Arsenal regained possession and supplied Gervinho, who showed uncharacteristically fine decision-making acumen by wrong-footing a defender before calmly laying the ball into the path of Carzola ... but from 10 yards t he Spaniard sidefoots way wide!</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Olympiakos continue to press and pester Arsenal, who still can't find fluency. \"Arsenal are pants,\" bellow William Marzouk. \"I'm taking the half time break to write an email to a potential employer, trying to come up with new and interesting ways to kiss ass without letting them know I'm kissing ass. Kind of like Tom Vermaelen's defending today.\" If anyone would like to help William out by suggesting 'new and interesting ways of kissing ass', please feel free.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Here we go again. No personnel changes but let's see if there will at least be a new mindset from Arsenal.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Half-time: </strong> Arsenal have been lax and the visitors fully deserve to be level at least. The pressing and diligence of the Greeks have forced constant errors from this leaderless Arsenal team, whose only regular threats have come from the two full-backs. Cazorla and Oxlade-Chamberlain have flickered and, of course, Gervinho scored to remind us that he was on the pitch but other than that, Arsenal have been poor going forward and slack all round. Changes needed. I'd chuck on Walcott for Podolski and Giroud for Gervinho.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Arsenal 1-1 Olympiakos (Mitroglou 45')</strong> That's fully deserved by Olympiakos and rightful comeuppance for Arsenal! The home team's sloppiness persisted as Greco was allowed to size up a cross from the right and he delivered a delicious ball, which Mitroglou met near the penalty spot to glance a perfect header into the far corner!</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> The goal has not cured Arsenal's sloppiness: Vermaelen gives the ball away in his own half with an unforgivably careless pass. Mitroglou's 25-yard shot is saved by Mannone.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Arsenal 1-0 Olympiakos (Gervinho 42')</strong> There endeth the Greek diligence! Cazorla showed some twinkly skills down the left but everything was too easy for them after that, including the woolly atttempted tackle on Arteta at the edge of the area and the sluggish dive of goalkeeper Megyeri, who allowed Gervinho's rather tame effort from 20 yards to find the net.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> Arsenal are looking increasingly clueless, Olympiakos increasingly composed and even threatening ...</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> Siovas is having splendid game in the middle for Olympiakos, being the main destroyer of Arsenal's scheming. His latest intervention, at the expense of Coquelin, led to another promising Olympiakos attack which was curtailed by another Koscileny foul. Machado takes the freekick but it's straight at Mannone.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> That's the best move of the game, the best chance, and a bad miss by Machado! Maniatis and Diakit\u00e9 combined nicely down the right before the former clipped in a wicked cross. Machado surged from deep to meet it but slashed over from close range. Lucky Arsenal!</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>33 min: </strong> It's tight and wet at the Emirates. Elsewhere, Schalke have equalised at home to Montpellier.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> Another Arsenal corner, another comfortable clearance.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Koscielny escapes with a yellow card for a wild two-footed tackle. And from the resultant freekick on mid-way, Olympiakos surge forward and Mitroglou sends in a fine low swirling shot that Mannone saves with difficulty.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Cazorla summons the sort of subtlety that Arsenal have lacked so far, slipping a dainty ball through to Gibbs, who had made a smart run behind the full-back. His cross was decent but Gervinho, not being a natural striker, was nowhere to be seen and the defence clear it comfortably.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Sloppiness is creeping into Arsenal's play as their frustration at not being able to pierce the diligent Greeks grows.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Arsenal win their fourth corner of the game and, as on each of the previous occasion, do not look like posing any threat from it.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Groans from the crowd as, for the second time in a minute, Coquelin tries an over-ambitious pass and hits it straight to an opponent. Cazrola rushes in to win the ball back off Greco, who takes that as his cue to fall down. And stay there for a couple of minutes. That's the third time in the match so far that one of the visiting players has done that. It'll be interesting to see how much time the ref adds on at the end of this half. They almost always seem to plump for one at the end of the first and three after 90 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> The Greeks' vigilance and Arsenal lack of ideas has made this pedestrian fare so far. Cazorla and Oxlade-Chamberlain have hinted at ingenuity and Gibbs and Jenkinson are bombing forward regularly down the wings but other than that, not much. Podolski and Gervinho have been largley irrelevant.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> With little of interest happening on the pitch, the cameras pans to Olympiakos manager Leonardo Jardim, who is clad in a large red bubble jacket. \"He looks a cool customer,\" says an approving Niall Quinn on Sky, no doubt thinking of a neat bubble jacket/disco pants ensemble.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> Olympiakos are enjoying a bout of possession but it ends when Diakit\u00e9 sends a humdrum cross into the box that Vermaelen deals with easily. Meanwhile, in the other match in this group, Schalke are losing 0-1 to Montpellier.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Gibbs embarks on a blazing run down the left, winning a freekick at the edge of the box. The angle seemed too acute for a shot but Cazorla went for it anyway and his fierce effort brought a decent save from Megyeri. Corner to Arsenal.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Olympiakos appear to have identified Cazorla as the main threat, as they rush to close him down in numbers every time he gets the ball. They've succeeded in stifling him so far, particularly Siovas who seems to be his main marker. But Arsenal are looking dangerous down the flanks, particularly on OXlade-Chamberlain's side.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Excellent work by Oxlade-Chamberlain, who's ignited the crowd's passion by chasing down opponents and winning the ball twice in a minute. And he produced a sumptuous cross afterwards, too, though the Greeks defended those better.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> It's lashing at the Emirates, with the rain hammering the grass in some kind of Samuel Kuffour tribute. But that's no excuse for the shoddy pass just perpetrated by Mannone. His waywardness gave Olympiakos a chance but Vermaelen tidied up at the expense of a corner.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Arsenal have dominated possession so far but they've yet to get behind or through the visitors.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> Off we go, the depleted Greeks getting two early touches thanks to winning the toss. Arsenal quickly take the ball off them thereafter.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>7.42pm: Here come the teams. Seems to be a good crowd at the Emirates. In terms of numbers, at least.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Preamble: </strong><br>Welcome to Arsenal's raison d'etre. In recent years Arsene Wenger has made qualification for the Champions League group stages the standard for success. And that has tended to mean annual engagements with Olympiakos, who usually prove obliging opponents. It's not very exciting but, hey, just look at that Gunners' balance sheet! Having said that, tonight's game should be worth watching (or, indeed, following on a friendly mbm), since Arsenal are still finetuning after another summer of transition and there are a few selection and formation questions that remain to be resolved. We should get clues tonight. </p> <p><strong>Teams:</strong><br><strong>Arsenal:</strong> Mannone; Jenkinson, Koscielny, Vermaelen, Gibbs; Arteta, Santi Cazorla, Coquelin; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Gervinho, Podolski<br><strong>Subs:</strong> Shea, Santos, Giroud, Walcott, Ramsey, Djourou, Arshavin<br><strong><br>Olympiacos:</strong> Megyeri; Diakit\u00e9, Mancolas, Contrearas, Holebas; Greco, Siovas, Fuster, Maniatis, Machado; Miroglou<br><strong>Subs:</strong> Carroll, Modesto, Ibagaza, Pantelic, Lykogiannis, Diogo, Abdoun</p> <p><strong>Ref:</strong> S Moen (Nor)</p> <p><strong>Deeply subjective team notes: </strong> <br>- This lark of deploying Gervinho as a false nine can't last. He is a false striker alright, but not in any sense that can bring Arsenal fans enduring joy. </p> <p>- Ramsey deserves to have been dropped. The Wales captain has generally been frustratingly passive so far this season. Lad needs to be more assertive with his passing and running if he wants to keep a regular place in Arsenal's midfield.</p> <p>- Wither Giroud, Mertesacker and Diaby all not starting, this is quite a small Arsenal side. Set-piece fun ahoy!</p> <!-- Block 1 --> <p>Paul will be here from 7pm. Well, there or thereabouts. Meanwhile, slake your thirst for Arsenal news with Kevin McCarra's match preview:</p> <blockquote> <p>Arsenal have made a strong start to their Champions League campaign but the club still have vexations and the unavailability of Abou Diaby is a particular cause of annoyance. The midfielder could take no part for France at Euro 2012 and his proneness to injury means that he must be handled with care. A thigh strain will stop him facing Olympiakos at the Emirates in the Champions League.</p> <p>\"It is really frustrating,\" said the Arsenal manager, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, of the player's vulnerability and the taxing schedule for Diaby in World Cup qualifiers. \"You think you are there but then it happens again. If France want him in Spain they should not take him for Finland and Belarus. The guy has been out for a year and then played four or five games. Give him a breather for two weeks to recover completely even if he is with the squad. It was a mistake to play him with the French national team.\"</p> <p>The value of Diaby is all too fresh in Arsenal minds after the defeat by Chelsea at the Emirates. The player had to be substituted and the visitors capitalised. \"When he moved out,\" said Wenger, \"[Alex-Oxlade] Chamberlain takes his position and immediately we lost a goal. This was a ball that Diaby would have won easily. And he also gives us power in midfield.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/02/abou-diaby-injury-arsenal-recovery\">Read more ...</a></p> </blockquote>",

Attackers, believed to have been dressed in military fatigues, are thought to have convinced regime soldiers stationed in Saadallah al-Jabiri Square to let them enter the secure zone. They are then thought to have detonated the bombs believed to have been packed into cars.</p> <p>Devastation was immense in the square. State television pictures also revealed significant damage to nearby residential buildings and offices. Both the Free Syria Army and a jihadist group, known as the Jabhat al-Nusra, claimed responsibility for the attack. Both said the blasts had targeted a military officer's club. Regime officials said the bombings were a suicide terrorist attack that had killed scores of civilians.</p> <p>Saadallah al-Jabiri Square is not far from Aleppo's ancient market, parts of which have been destroyed in recent days during intense clashes between regime troops and rebels. The battle for Aleppo is taking an increasingly heavy toll on the city's historical sites as battle lines, which are drawn largely through a north to south line, slowly shift.</p> <p>The regime's military remains in control of much of the west of the city, but its grip in parts has steadily been loosened throughout almost three months of relentless guerilla fighting.</p> <p>Rebels are now mounting hit and run attacks in most parts of Aleppo, which until recent weeks has been a city of two halves. The regime military maintains dominance of the country's skies and has access to much heavier weapons than the rebel military, yet it remains unable to assert itself across a vast tract of land from Aleppo to the Turkish border and east to the desert regions that spread towards Iraq.</p> <p>Aleppo has become a focal point of the now blazing civil war. Both sides acknowledge that the outcome of the war depends on the battle for the ancient city.</p> <p>Daily death tolls in Syria now constantly exceed 120 and more than 30,000 people, many of them civilians, are believed to have been killed since the uprising began.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 October 2012, because the original misspelled the name of the Turkish foreign minister as Ahmed Davagotlu.

  "<p>I liked David Cameron; when he became Conservative party leader in 2005 he recognised that something was badly wrong with the right, and a new radical conservatism was desperately needed. I proposed a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/26/michael-white-david-cameron-thinktank\" title=\"\">red Toryism</a> \u2013 a commitment to the progressive merits of tradition and social conservatism and the need to build ethos-driven institutions, and a new Tory economics that distributed property, market access and educational excellence to all. <a href=\"http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/riseoftheredtories/\" title=\"\">In 2009 I argued for a new one-nation approach</a> to Britain's problems, and Cameron appeared to agree. The principles of re-localising the economy, re-capitalising the poor and re-moralising the market were echoed in Cameron's speeches and policy ideas.</p> <p>I did and still do believe in all this. I advocated a bottom-up civic renewal of our society; plus I wanted to recover social conservatism not as a reactionary war on single mothers or gay people, but as a conserving force to restore the family and loving human relationships as the primary agent of renewal, and the first front in the war on poverty, human neglect and social dysfunction. Crucially I argued conservative economics were not delivering on conservative principles and that current versions of free-market economics were re-inscribing class and caste.</p> <p>Cameron to his great credit spoke to all of this and offered as its realisation \"the big society\" \u2013 a whole package of measures to add to community empowerment, civic life and community businesses. It was unfortunately designed to work alongside rather than convert a dysfunctional economic model. But despite appalling communication and a belief it was just about volunteering, it gave a sense of social rejuvenation and structural shift. Big society was Cameron's unfulfilled promise to do and be something different.</p> <p>But what a disappointment and what a tragedy this promised renewal of one-nation conservatism has become. Make no mistake: a radical Toryism has been abandoned, the once-in-a-generation chance to redefine conservatism on something other than a reductive market liberalism has been lost. In 2009 I argued that the party had renewed its social vision but not its economic philosophy, and if it simply repeated 1980s economics, then that would destroy everything else on offer.</p> <p>And so it has proved. In an act of almost inexplicable carelessness Cameron has abandoned his social project for a re-toxifying 1980s approach to the deficit. He has surrendered No 10 to Treasury determination and become a creature of other people's means rather than his own envisager of ends \u2013 the starkest example of which is that in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/22/budget-2010-key-points\" title=\"\">emergency budget of 2010</a> he allowed the largest cuts to fall on local authorities even before his own <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/contents/enacted\" title=\"\">Localism Act</a> had come into force, allowing communities to take over public services or employees to mutualise and modernise \u2013 undermining the big society agenda from the very outset.</p> <p>The government is now focused on a purely negative agenda of deficit reduction, and unable to offer a positive vision of the future. Almost overnight the idea of a governing principle and a vision of a better Britain was overthrown by economic austerity and a smug and indifferent Treasury. Yes, the deficit bequeathed by Labour is a real economic emergency, and yes it cannot be ignored, and yes a simplistic continuance of the Keynesian status quo would simply restore a defunct and broken economic model. But the means employed to address it are defunct and outdated. Supply side reform is not a sufficient condition for growth: an economic approach that worked, for some, 40 years ago now appears not to work for any. Deficit reduction is not even working on its own terms \u2013 the government will be borrowing more at the end of its term than at the beginning, and what cuts have been made have predominately fallen on capital expenditure, which since it depresses long-term growth pushes short-term borrowing to yet new heights. The Treasury, unable to grasp that supply-side laissez-faire is not a sufficient condition of growth, is now scrabbling all too late to set up initiatives it once derided.</p> <p>The PM has given up something for nothing, ceding all his strategic and visionary thinking to George Osborne's tactical and failing approach to the deficit. A new conservatism has been strangled at birth; a failure to rethink the party's economic offer means that old economics have killed new politics.</p> <p>Why has this been allowed to happen? Cynics will say that Cameron never believed in his vision in the first place and it was all a cover for rightwing extremism. I don't accept this; I suspect the failure is philosophical and structural. Cameron has, or had, some of the best intuitions in British politics but lacks the ability to synthesise these into concepts and clear principles. A pragmatism that refuses to choose or decide on any governing principles may well have worked in earlier more prosperous times but in this economic crisis it's a disaster. The refusal to decide what type of conservatism he represents has led to him backing all the dogs in the fight and abandoning his own vision to the victor. This, coupled with a refusal to lead from the centre, has resulted in a decentralisation of power and a dissipation of purpose. Departments have permission to run with whatever variant of conservatism any minister finds persuasive. Hence the calamities of NHS reform, Europe and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/15/labour-work-programme-chaos\" title=\"\">work programme</a>.</p> <p>Rather like some ghastly ghost story, the various shades of the conservative past have returned and overwhelmed the good that Cameron originally represented. His brand is now polling almost at the same level as that of the Conservative party itself. His failure to maintain a coherent new vision has led to spasmodic appeals to vague progressive notions that have further alienated his own base and suggested that the PM is not a master of his own beliefs. None of this is helped by an almost permanent lack of central direction; even cabinet ministers do not know who is in control of the government's message or approach.</p> <p>Cameron himself is no longer aided by people with a strategic vision for the country \u2013 Steve Hilton has left, exhausted by internal competition over direction, and the PM is surrounded by pragmatists who constantly behave as if short-term electoral advantage is long-term strategic thinking.</p> <p>Cameron's thinking is now out of step with public demands and economic reality. People desperately want a new economic and social settlement. But nothing is on offer from the right, so the left has moved into the vacuum. More worryingly for Cameron, Ed Miliband's speech this week wasn't even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/may/17/ed-miliband-endorses-blue-labour-thinking\" title=\"\">blue Labour</a> \u2013 he was red Tory when he both vindicated Cameron's original vision and sidelined it by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/03/ed-miliband-worthy-inheritor-disraeli-creed\" title=\"\">appropriating Disraeli</a>.</p> <p>One nation is the new common ground of British politics. If the prime minister does not respond he faces the real possibility of an inglorious one-term premiership. Cameron had the original vision; he must recover it. He should turn to building new moral institutions, re-endow his localism with financial infrastructure and recognise the family and human association as the greatest ally in the war on poverty, disadvantage and human suffering. Cameron is at his best with his back to the wall \u2013 let us hope he now recognises that this is where he is.</p>",
  "<p>The full tide and the strong winds were making the rolling sea crash against the hard coast with some force. When the waves hit the onshore rocks, the high, almost dazzling, white foam formed real and imaginary shapes. Despite all the restless turmoil, the sea was coloured in two huge areas. Nearer the shore, the waves were a dull grey, but far out to the north and west there was a dramatic looking change. It was as if an artist had drawn a line with a paint brush across a canvas \u2013 beyond the line, the sea was an attractive blue green.</p> <p>The winds were affecting the seabirds, especially the birds flying eastwards. Eider ducks, gannets, auks and scoters hurtled past almost as though they were out of control from the elements. In contrast, those flying west were battling against the wind to make headway. Even the gannets, unusually all of them juveniles, had to keep as close to the sea as they could, despite their long, powerful wings, but even then they found it hard going. The only birds actually on the sea were the eiders and shags, the former scarcely bothered with the conditions. They were still feeding, no doubt on shellfish, yet they were without the normally attendant gulls. Small groups of gulls will gather around, waiting for any scraps to be pirated, but perhaps the wind was just too much for them.</p> <p>While some of the shags were scattered singly on the sea, many others were resting on the harbour wall around the other side of the peninsula. A few were standing with wings extended, looking like ancient, perhaps medieval, emblems. There still seems to be some debate as to whether this posture is simply to dry their wings or to aid digestion. There were herring gulls with the birds, which gave an idea of the larger shags' size, although they are smaller than their close cousins, the cormorants, with a much slimmer beak and neck.</p>",
  "<p>At about quarter to one on Tuesday, some people appeared in the Manchester conference centre holding signs that said \"end of queue\". It was a bit optimistic, I thought. Why would anybody queue for an hour to see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2012/oct/02/ed-miliband-speech-labour-conference-video?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband's speech</a>? There was a video link anyway, or you could watch it on your phone. But once again, I had underestimated the obedience of the delegates. When they call them the party faithful, they don't mean in the sense that they won't get into bed with any other party; they mean as faithful as a dog. Tell them to queue, master, and they will. They won't ask why, any more than they'd ask what the big deal is about sitting.</p> <p>Conferences are like Christmas, there's never any anger until everyone gets safely away from each other. The starkest thing you could say about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/26/nick-clegg-lib-dem-conference-live?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Nick Clegg's speech</a> was that the audience only fell into a rapture twice. This leader has turned his foot soldiers from doorstep darlings (in a \"we might not vote for you, but you lot are all right\" sort of way) to the living embodiment of political disillusion. People who have built their social identity round this underdog party have seen its reputation for benignly doing nothing trashed by a young man in a hurry. You'd think they'd be slightly irked; you'd think it might show. It didn't.</p> <p>Labour was the same story \u2013 even the rage toward the coalition felt vaudeville and uncommitted. There was no interrogation of how the party itself is progressing, neither in the halls nor in the corridors nor particularly in the fringes; there never is. Well, there is no point making trouble for yourself in opposition, you might think (though I bet you next week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\" title=\"\">Tory conference</a> is exactly the same). And these are, after all, the diehard political fans. It is possible that they are slightly starstruck, having previously only seen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2012/oct/03/andy-burnham-nhs-reforms-fragmentation\" title=\"\">Andy Burnham's eyelashes</a> on the television.</p> <p>But I no longer believe this to be the adulation of the unquestioning hardcore. Rather, the whole point of a party conference \u2013 not as a meeting of minds, but as a performance to the rest of the nation \u2013 is so well-established that for party members to voice discontent under the glare of the cameras would be as taboo as if the extras stood up in the middle of a film and said they were bored, or they needed the toilet.</p> <p>It is frequently cited as the mark of a deft politician, that he or she can keep the room happy, while saying the things that the nation at large wants to hear but&#xa0;the room doesn't.</p> <p>This was what Ed Balls did, when he made <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/oct/01/ed-balls-labour-conference-live-blog\" title=\"\">an agile allusion to the fact that he didn't intend to reverse this government's spending cuts</a> (I have reached the point in my life where I don't expect any government to reverse anything done by the one before, however much they kvetched at the time. They absolutely hate to repeal. I neither like it nor understand it, I simply know that it's a law of the universe).</p> <p>Nevertheless, there must have been some people in the hall who were pretty disappointed to hear this, but you'd have seen them in hell (rather than the red-bathed hell-alike the Labour hall often resembles) before they'd have let fly a boo, or even a hiss. This isn't because the shadow chancellor is deft. It's because the conventions of this convention are so well understood \u2013 the crowd's role is as meat in the room, but it has to be happy meat.</p> <p>Since TV is the medium of this elaborate performance, the signifiers get simpler and simpler, so that much of it is done with lighting: the Lib Dems bathed in green, to indicate an environmentalism that I actually believe is the case but like everything else, sincerely doubt they'll get their way on; Miliband in blue, steady, unpartisan, one nation, a bit like the other guy, only better. This year, speakers have started to stand in the round, with the audience behind them as well as in front, the clearest admission yet that the performance is for the camera. It doesn't matter if some people are listening to the back of Miliband's head. The crowd is there to sell the image, not buy its message. Where you might once have had a plant in the audience to commence applause, now the whole audience is a plant.</p> <p>Nostalgia for a politics of yore is for people with very short memories. I doubt there was ever a time when conferences were used as a genuine space to thrash out policy. But the inevitable consequence of choreographing everything with your eye according to how it will appear on telly is that you put the accent on repetition, clarity, simplicity and brevity. American presidential candidates have been distilling their thoughts into Twitter-sized bites since before Twitter was invented.</p> <p>Miliband has picked up what I previously thought was a Cameroonian bid to buy some time while he remembered what he was about to say: \"Let me be clear,\" he says. It's the verbal equivalent of TV makeup \u2013 it works from a distance, but up close, the artifice disfigures the face underneath. This pantomime disfigures real political conviction, I mean \u2013 Miliband's actual face is, of course, fine.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://de.twitter.com/zoesqwilliams\" title=\"\"><em>@zoesqwilliams</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama has arrived in Denver for his debate showdown with Mitt Romney, the 90-minute televised encounter that could decide the outcome of the White House race.</p> <p>The Obama campaign, with polls showing the president ahead in most of the swing states, would be relatively happy to wake up tomorrow morning to reports of an uneventful draw.</p> <p>But Romney, after week after week of setbacks, needs a strong performance. With a predicted television audience of more than 50 million, the debate offers him one of his last opportunites in sell both his policies and his personality. He has been in Denver since the start of the week, rehearsing.</p> <p>This will be the 36th of the nationally televised presidential and vice-presidential debates since the first in 1960 between Kennedy and Nixon. It is the first time Obama and Romney will have come face-to-face in a debate.</p> <p>With the Denver Post headline describing a 'Duel In Denver', a Republican strategist described the debate as Romney's last opportunity. Mark McKinnon, a former adviser to George Bush, told the Post it is \"Romney's last, best chance to turn things around. He'll have to exceed expectations by a lot. He needs to have a moment that gets people to view him differently. And he needs to articulate some ideas that people think are credible on the economy. He needs to appeal across the board.\"</p> <p>Romney has been lifted ahead of the debate by the first indications that after trailing badly over the last three weeks, the polls could be beginning to tighten. His campaign team also view vice-president Joe Biden's remark that the working-class had been \"buried\" over the last four years of slow economic recovery as an eve-of-debate bonus.</p> <p>There will be two further presidential debates and a vice-presidential one this month \u2013 but the first debates have historically attracted the biggest audience.</p> <p>Most debates have little impact on the eventual outcome but there have been exceptions, in particular in 1960, and the tussle between Al Gore and George Bush in 2000.</p> <p>The Denver debate is supposed to be exclusively about domestic issues such as the economy and healthcare, but Romney is expected to try to squeeze in at least some mention of Obama's handling of the Middle East.</p> <p>One of Romney's campaign team, political veteran Ben Ginsberg, talking at a Politico breakfast meeting in Denver, gleefully greeted Biden's \"buried\" remark as \"a rare moment of truth-telling\".</p> <p>He said that Obama, as the incumbent, had the advantages of the trappings of office and the luxury of time, in not having to focus earlier in the year on primaries and caucuses. But tonight they will be evenly matched, two very articulate individuals steeped in policy.</p> <p>Ginsberg expected Romney to flesh out some of his policies. \"I think it is fair for people in the last four weeks (of the campaign) to ask for specifics, and we are happy to oblige,\" he said.</p> <p>Romney, under pressure to provide details about his proposed tax policies, attempted to defuse the issue ahead of the debate by saying he planned to limit individual tax deductions to $17,000. A campaign staffer said he will provide more details about the tax plans over the next few weeks.</p> <p>The president opted to spent his time preparing near Las Vegas. His campaign team, with a reputation as control freaks, did not anticipate any problem with altitude making him listless, flying in from Las Vegas, which is over 2,000 feet, to Denver at more than 5,000 ft.</p> <p>One of Obama's campaign team, former White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, also at the Politico event, did not view the debate as a battle between the two candidates but an opportunity for both to set out their distinctive policies before such a large audience.</p> <p>While there would inevitably be some interaction, Gibbs said, \"I do not think the president approaches it like a boxing match.\"</p> <p>Gibbs anticipated the president would use the debate as a platform to set out his plans for a second term, including how to create more jobs, double exports, bring back manufacturing to America from overseas and creating a more skilled workforce. \"I think this is what you will hear tonight,\" Gibbs said.</p> <p>He predicted the election would be close, noting that Obama, in what he described as \"near-perfect conditions\" in 2008, had received 53%. There were nine states in play, he said, including Wisconsin. On election night, he identified Ohio and Virginia as the two states to watch.</p> <p>He dismissed a video of a 2007 Obama speech shown on the conservative website the Daily Caller and Fox on Tuesday night in which he praised his former pastor and criticised the Bush administration for largely ignoring the mainly black victims of Hurricane Katrina. He said it had not been a secret event but one that had been open to the press and had been widely covered at the time.</p>",
  "<p>The youth zone is packed, the atmosphere expectant and the session on how to win using social media just getting underway when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/lisa-nandy\" title=\"\">Lisa Nandy, shadow minister for children</a>, utters a mild threat. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/tom-watson\" title=\"\">Tom Watson</a> will be along soon, she says brightly, a man who \"adds a touch of glamour\" to modern Westminster.

Deputy chair of Labour. An MP who resembles a slightly rumpled, pleased-with-himself toy bear. Unofficial shadow secretary for glamour? I look down again at the session's title: Tweet That! The exclamation mark sounds like a slight scream of desperation.</p> <p>It is a note that echoes all around the conference buildings in Manchester on Monday. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/sep/24/labour-lead-tories-icm-poll?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Labour might be 10 points ahead in the polls</a>, their biggest lead since Iain Duncan Smith was Tory leader, but the mood in the days and hours before <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/edmiliband\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband</a>'s speech is worried, muted, heavy with anticipation. The Labour leader's face beams from the cover of every publication you see here: serious and doe-eyed on The House, parliament's magazine; in profile, tongue peeping out, for Modern Gov; all large, crowded teeth in the caricature on the New Statesman, trying to contain Ed Balls, who is depicted as a bulldog on a leash.</p> <p>On page four of the conference programme he is giving his best <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D519hT7-ytY\" title=\"\">blue steel</a> (that's a Zoolander reference, politics people, not a Tory one): mild pout, mistily narrowed eyes. It's the seductive look of a man whose party knows this is his moment to connect with an electorate disillusioned not just with Labour, but with politics as a whole, an electorate that has yet to get to know him. A frightened awareness of this last fact fills the air. On Sunday, in a TV interview, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/harrietharman\" title=\"\">Harriet Harman</a> remarks that \"a lot of people don't actually know who the leader of the opposition is\". The same day, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/jackstraw\" title=\"\">Jack Straw</a> writes that Miliband's task \"is to allow the real Ed to escape from behind the rather abstract language he sometimes uses\". He goes on to mention that dread term \"pre-distribution\".</p> <p>The outlook is, at first, unpromising. It is raining, transparent umbrellas bobbing along the streets like an ominous fluther of jellyfish. Inside the main hall the climbing wall is empty, the fudge stand fudgeless, and tired delegates are stripping off suit jackets for a pummelling at the 10-minute massage stall. I watch one lean forward, lanyard swinging, as a masseur's elbow disappears into his shoulders. Kelly Bramall, massage therapist, says these clients are much more stressed than the ones she sees at festival gigs. She can feel the deep knots in their neck muscles.</p> <p>I'm looking for vim and vigour, but at Tweet That! the mood is surprisingly downbeat, the average age in the youth zone, I would estimate generously, to be 45. A delegate, speaking from the floor, remarks flatly: \"The key for politicians at all levels is to appear human, because we all know they're actually not.\"</p> <p>I chase after the Labour students, in their bright pink T-shirts, hoping for some youthful \"we're going to win this\" attitude from a team down but not quite out. None of them will speak. They would have to get it signed off, they say, before passing me on to student officers, who pass me on to other student officers. The general mood is quiet, tight-lipped. It might be the silence of people who are scared to say the wrong thing, or scared that if they open their mouth they might begin crying.</p> <p>The people on the Socialist societies stand are thankfully more friendly, and the T-shirt they are selling, with that long-standing LGBT Labour slogan \u2013 Never Kissed a Tory \u2013 offers a hint of irreverence. Jamie Hodge, events and fundraising officer for LGBT Labour, has been careening around the conference hall, asking shadow ministers to pose with a sign saying: \"Labour 4 Equal Marriage.\" He scrolls through the smiling pictures on his camera. \"Ed Miliband. Ed Balls. David Miliband. I've got everyone\". He arrives at a picture of Stephen Twigg, shadow education secretary, \"throwing some shapes on the dancefloor\" at the LGBT party that kicked off the conference. \"We had about 500 people dancing to Gaga,\" he says. Which songs? \"God, every single one\".</p> <p>Martin Whelton, from the Labour party Irish Society, says he's finding conference invigorating, and thought <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/01/ed-balls-conference-speech-classic?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Balls's speech</a> was excellent. (There are a lot of upbeat noises about Balls's affordable-housing pledge.) \"I believe passionately that Ed Miliband will be the prime minister,\" he says, like a true believer, before describing his mood as quietly confident.</p> <p>An old friend of mine, a long-time Labour councillor, says that there is no unrealistic optimism at the moment. If I have picked up on a depressed air, he continues, it is because conference is something like \"group therapy\" for a lot of councillors this year, at a time when their work involves such unappealing decisions as whether to cut youth services, social care or libraries. The feeling of diminishing returns is everywhere.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397259677\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349286791793/A-box-invites-delegates-t-010.jpg\" alt=\"A box invites delegates to vote on whether Ed Miliband should stay or go as leader.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A box allowing delegates to vote on whether Blairites in the Labour party should stay or go.

On the way to the conference hall, I ask the people of Manchester what they think of Miliband. The woman behind the till in Sainsbury's says she doesn't really think he's prime minister material, she's not impressed by the way he talks \u2013 although as a long-time Labour voter she will probably give him a chance. Jacqueline, a charity worker, out on a cigarette break, looks nonplussed when I mention his name. I repeat it. She blinks back. I explain that he is the Labour leader and she says it's funny, because, again, she's a long-time Labour voter. A streetcleaner shrugs his confusion.</p> <p>Outside the conference centre, alongside the Remploy campaigners waving signs that say \"Maria Miller Factory Killer\", a man dressed as a bee suspects Miliband is not \"charismatic enough\" to win over the electorate.</p> <p>The moment of truth is soon to arrive, and there's more of a buzz in the hall. <a href=\"http://www.politicus.org.uk/news/tessa-jowell-speech-in-full_682\" title=\"\">Tessa Jowell is giving her Olympics and Paralympics speech</a> in the main auditorium, and while there is a moment early on when she loses me (she mentions that not a single construction worker died in the building of the Olympic stadium, a prospect that I had never previously considered and which sends me into a long spiral of retrospective fretting), the mood in the half-full hall is fairly good. The Olympics footage is genuinely moving, the mass Mobot is fleeting but enthusiastic, and the torchbearers, gamesmakers and Olympians, who include <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nicola-adams\" title=\"\">Nicola Adams</a>, are greeted with huge warmth because, well, everyone loves Nicola Adams.</p> <p>The anticipation rises as Miliband's speech approaches. As people file into the hall, there is an excited murmur, which continues through the slightly unconvincing film, painting him as just another ordinary comprehensive lad. Then it is on to his first appearance on stage. There is a standing ovation, which he greets with a goofy smile. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/oct/02/ed-miliband-speech-labour-conference-live?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">His decision to deliver the speech without notes</a> is clearly popular, and as he talks, more and more lines land strongly.</p> <p>There is mass appreciation for the comment: \"David Cameron isn't just writing the cheques. He is receiving one.\" Also for the line: \"Have you ever seen a more incompetent, hopeless, out of touch, U-turning, pledge-breaking, make-it-up-as-you-go-along, back-of-the-envelope, miserable shower than this prime minister and this government?\" And he gets into some snappy call-and-response action as he talks about Cameron's reorganisation of the NHS. \"The GPs said no.\" \"No!\" shout the delegates. \"The nurses said no.\" \"No!\" they shout again. \"You just can't trust the Tories on the national health service,\" prompts another standing ovation.</p> <p>The anti-Tory lines play exceptionally strongly, but so too do some others about his background and beliefs, and on the way out of the auditorium, the burbled reactions are overwhelmingly positive. \"He must have a very good memory, and what a lovely, clear voice.\".\"Knowing him, he'll be worried people will think he's a rightwinger, but he shouldn't.\" \"A very, very clear message.\" My councillor friend texts one word: \"Awesome.\"</p> <p>I speak to Beth Miller, 20, and George Lindars-Hammond, 21. Both attend Sheffield University, and Lindars-Hammond is a Labour councillor. \"I just want to go out and make Ed Miliband prime minister now,\" he says. \"I did before, but I really do now.\" Ben Lucas, a 17-year-old delegate from Macclesfield, says it was \"good to hear about Ed's past. I think the British people don't really know much about him, so obviously if he's going to become prime minister people need to find out more.\" I ask Harman whether Miliband passed the test of showing off his true self, helping the country get to know him as a person, and she says, predictably but apparently ingenuously, he did. \"He talked very personally about his family, his school life \u2013 this is who I am, what I believe in \u2013 and I think it was very compelling.\"</p> <p>On the steps outside the hall, councillors are milling excitedly. Ed Turner, deputy leader of Oxford city council, was pleased Miliband spoke up for disabled people, and for those out of work. Tony Newman, leader of the Labour group in Croydon, believes he connected with the public at a time when \"politics is getting very, very real, because it's affecting far more people\".</p> <p>And I catch up with Jamie Hodge, still running around the conference centre, accosting MPs with his \"Labour 4 Equal Marriage\" sign. \"Bullshit aside, I thought that was brilliant,\" he says. \"Let's be honest, I think one speech is not going to make a leader, or a man, or a prime minister, and there's three years to go until an election. But from my point of view, and for Labour party members, I think everyone was very pleased with that.\" As I leave Manchester, the rain is still sheeting, but a very palpable cloud has lifted.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 October 2012 to correct a photo caption that said \"A box invites delegates to vote on whether Ed Miliband should stay or go as leader\". In fact the question being asked of delegates by a reporter from the BBC's Daily Politics show was: \"Should Blairites stay or go?\" On answering the question, they were invited to place a ball in one of the two boxes shown in the picture.</p>",
  "<p>With his dark suit, single white glove and air of twinkly indulgence Agostino Perrone, the head barman at London's Connaught Bar, looks every part the magician. He is mixing a martini, the gin cascading at arm's length over ice, a chilled glass at the ready.</p> <p>It's a ritual that has been performed at this hotel thousands of times since the drink became fashionable in London in the early 1930s. For much of the 20th century if you wanted a classic cocktail in the capital, you came to luxury joints such as the Connaught or the Savoy. In the real world cocktail bars had steadily been degraded by an explosion in ultra-sweet and garish drinks that signified almost the exact opposite of their original sophistication. By 1981, when the Human League's Susan Sulley sang that she was \"working as a waitress in a cocktail bar\" everyone understood that she was on the bottom rung of the social ladder until poor, ill-used Phil Oakey came along to rescue her.</p> <p>Now, for the first time in decades, London's bartenders have a spring in their step. At this summer's Spirited Awards at Tales of the Cocktail in New Orleans, the industry's most prestigious competition, the capital's bars and their staff grabbed nearly all of the international prizes.</p> <p>Perrone's revamped Connaught Bar was named the world's best bar, but other nominees were 69 Colebrooke Row in Islington and Nightjar and Callooh Callay in Shoreditch. Meanwhile, other London bars the Artesian(Best Hotel Bar, and Best International Bartender for Alex Kratena), Zetter Town House (Best New Cocktail Bar)and Salvatore's at The Playboy (Best Drinks Selection)won their categories outright, while Whistling Shop and Happiness Forgets were also nominated.</p> <p>\"People say that the 1920s and 1930s&#xa0;were the golden age of cocktails,\" says Perrone, \"but that was the era of prohibition in the United States. Those weren't positive times. We're living through the golden age now.\"</p> <p>A lot of the credit for this golden age, at least in London, goes to Tony Conigliaro. His bar, 69 Colebrooke Row, looks, with its black and white check floor and white-jacketed bar-staff, like an Italian barbers from the 1950s. Round the corner he has a laboratory that has helped to introduce a new scientific rigour to the business of making drinks. The fruit in the rhubarb gimlet there, for example, has been put through a centrifuge to reduce it to a beautiful cordial, something like the platonic essence of rhubarb. He sees drinks, almost literally, as building blocks.</p> <p>\"I visualise drinks as 3D objects to work out how they'll go together,\" he explains. \"and I quite often draw them when I'm working on a cocktail. To me different spirits have different shapes ... gin looks like a sphere but with all these bits coming out, like a kind of Rubik's Cube.\"</p> <p>This approach, dubbed \"molecular mixology\", much to his displeasure, has devotees around the world. Even the traditionalist Connaught allows Perrone to add his own special \"botanicals\", flavours such as cardamom and ginger to his martini and he offers a deconstructed Bloody Mary topped with a celery foam.</p> <p>But science is not the only reason for London's newfound success. Nightjar owner Edmund Weil points out that the capital's multicultural appeal means bars can attract expert bartenders from all over the world.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Callooh Callay's Andrea Montague thinks it is London's drinking public that has changed. \"People are not scared of alcohol any more,\" she says. \"They used to want tall, fruity drinks for the effect. Now they're asking for a martini, two to one, with gin and an olive.\"</p> <p>Many of those people will be visiting the city from Monday for <a href=\"http://www.londoncocktailweek.com/%E2%80%9Dwww.londoncocktailweek.com\" title=\"\">London Cocktail Week</a>, when up to 15,000 punters will descend on its bars for seminars and to try new flavours. Organiser Hannah Sharman-Cox says that she wants cocktails to become \"as popular as cooking\". This is optimistic but, if anything from the Depression has to return, a well mixed Martini certainly wouldn't be at the bottom of my list.</p>",
  "<p>On Sunday, 30 September, a debate began on Twitter \u2013 later dubbed <a href=\"http://storify.com/adelinekoh/what-are-the-ethics-of-live-tweeting-at-conference.html\" title=\"\">#Twittergate</a> \u2013 about the etiquette and ethics of live-tweeting academic conferences. Summarising the crux of the matter, journalist <a href=\"http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/10/02/scholars-debate-etiquette-live-tweeting-academic-conferences\" title=\"\">Steve Kolowich</a> later writes: \"Scholars often present unpublished work at conferences. But while they may be willing to expose an unpolished set of ideas to a group of peers, academics may be less eager to have those peers turn around and broadcast those ideas to the world\".</p> <p>Live-blogging \u2013 and similarly live-tweeting \u2013 is essentially a form of reporting and a way of engaging with real life events. It is a form of broadcasting content, but is also a form of research. If it is looked at through a broadcasting lens, guidelines from journalism and research ethics (particularly, <a href=\"http://oro.open.ac.uk/15395/\" title=\"\">internet-mediated research</a>) could be helpful for those working with social media to report academic events as they take place.</p> <p>I have previously blogged about the <a href=\"http://hastac.org/blogs/ernesto-priego/2012/10/03/useful-resources-academic-live-bloggers\">resources available to academic live-bloggers</a>, all of which are relevant for tweeting, but my ten basic rules of thumb for live-tweeting a conference are:</p> <p><strong>1. </strong> If you are an event organiser, decide in advance if you will allow tweeting. I personally believe 'live-tweeting encouraged' should be the default mode for most large arts and humanities conferences.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> There is no way you will be able to completely stop it from happening, but it's the organisers' prerogative to set your own guidelines and standards. The hashtag should be advertised in advance, making sure it's relevant, easy to type and does not have alternative meanings or uses on Twitter. To help ensure that the key points you want disseminated from the conference get out, appoint some experienced social media users to be your 'official' live-tweeterers.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> If you are going to take photos, whether you intend to post them online or not, always ask if it's OK first, even if it's impractical to do so. If anyone doesn't want other scholars promoting their papers online, maybe they should reconsider what conferences are for in the first instance. It's better not to take photos of large groups (i.e. the audience) unless you have permission from all of them to do so. If they ask you to please not tweet, you should try to respect that.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> If you will be in charge of live-tweeting the whole event or individual sessions, take it seriously. It's a cliche but with great power comes great responsibility.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> Attribution is key: Be clear in your tweets about who is saying what. If you don't attribute and/or use quotation marks when reporting what has been said, people can (and rightly will) assume it's you saying it. If the speaker is on Twitter, find out what they are called on Twitter in advance, as their 'handle' will often be shorter than their name.</p> <p><strong>6.</strong> If you are quoting directly, use quotation marks. Think direct and indirect reported speech. Never assume anything you read online is from the public demain. Attribute other people's ideas or anything else you quote. It's not just good manners, it's professional ethics.</p> <p><strong>7.</strong> Even if you completely disagree with what is being said, always be polite and respectful. Don't tweet anything you wouldn't say to a person or group face-to-face.</p> <p><strong>8.</strong> If you are live-tweeting an event, assume that people outside the conference will be interested and/or will read your tweets. This includes people who don't follow you directly. Explain frequently what that obscure hashtag means, so the hashtag achieves the purpose of promoting the event and ideas outside the four walls of the event venue.</p> <p><strong>9.</strong> Link liberally. Search for references as speakers present. Share with your followers the resources the presenters are showing in the room \u2013 unless you are not meant to and one should expect speakers and/or organisers to indicate this in advance.</p> <p><strong>10.</strong> Enjoy it. Live-tweeting should be fun, empowering and inspiring. It should create positive opportunities. It's all about engagement, community building and widening participation.</p> <p>As social media usage becomes a common feature at conferences, anxieties about authority, control, attribution, originality and privacy are likely to haunt the theory and practice of scholarly social media use for some time to come. But embracing openness and transparency, through Twitter or blogging, can coexist with the existing expectations for academic rigor, ethics and civil behaviour.</p> <p>Academics who are comfortable with and enthusiastic about social media need to communicate that live-tweeting at conferences is not a threat to scholarly activity but the contrary: an ally.</p> <p><em>Ernesto Priego is a freelance researcher affiliated with the </em><a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh\" title=\"\"><em>UCL Centre for Digital Humanities</em></a><em>.

  "<p>The Food Standards Agency has suspended plans to warn pregnant women and young children about the health risks of eating game shot with lead ammunition, prompting confusion and dismay among campaigners.</p> <p>The agency, which issues official guidance to consumers, had been expected to issue a statement on Wednesday warning vulnerable groups against eating game such as deer, grouse, pheasant and boar killed with lead shot.</p> <p>It was also expected to advise other adults who regularly ate wild game shot with lead pellets to cut their consumption to avoid serious lead poisoning.</p> <p>The lead ammunition group, the government's advisory panel, decided on Tuesday to release the guidance, but that decision has been overturned. Sources close to the panel said no clear reason had been given.</p> <p>The panel \u2013 which includes the UK's main shooting and conservation bodies such as the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust (WWT), the British Association of Shooting and Conservation, and the Countryside Alliance \u2013 had been investigating the issue since its inception in 2009.</p> <p>Debbie Pain, conservation director of WWT and an authority on lead shot in game birds, who has played a key role in formulating the advice to consumers, said: \"They've now said they're delaying publication but I don't know what that means. Is it a week or a month? I have no idea at all.\"</p> <p>A study by the European Food Standard Agency published in July and based on studies of 144,000 food samples collected over a nine-year period from across the EU <a href=\"http://www.leadammunitiongroup.co.uk/information.html\" title=\"\">found very high levels of lead in pheasant and boar</a>. Although those meats are not often eaten in the UK, the results were so high they skewed the overall findings for all meat products tested.</p> <p>The EFSA report said: \"Particularly high results were recorded for wild boar meat and pheasant meat, presumably associated with the use of lead ammunition. The many high results for wild boar meat skewed the distribution for this food category so that the mean exceeded the 95th percentile.\"</p> <p>Expert studies by the UK government's Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera) presented to the lead ammunition group cited grouse, duck, partridge and deer as potential sources of lead poisoning for consumers in the UK. The use of lead shot in duck-shooting was banned in the UK in 1999 but was still widespread, the agency said.</p> <p>An FSA spokesman said the decision to suspend publication had been taken \"this week\". He confirmed that the warnings \"will be about lead and exposures to lead and advice for people lessening their exposures to lead. It will be directed at the small number of people who eat lead shot game on a regular basis.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We're not publishing it today. It is still under review and we still haven't quite got it ready yet. We're looking to be publishing something on lead ammunition and small birds and larger animals but we not publishing today.\"</p> <p>He said the FSA had not yet decided when the advice would be published, but that it would appear \"shortly\".</p> <p>The Fera report, given to the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in 2010, said evidence on the scale of the risk to consumers from contaminated game was unclear and inconsistent, but there was a <a href=\"http://www.leadammunitiongroup.co.uk/information.html\" title=\"\">consensus that no levels of lead in food were safe</a>.</p> <p>It stated: \"Humans that eat game animals that have been shot with lead ammunition are at risk of poisoning from the fragments of bullets or pellets that remain embedded in the meat or in other edible tissues; the risk from biologically-incorporated lead in game appears to be low.</p> <p>\"Radiographs of shot deer have shown that when a lead bullet breaks up on impact some fragments are too small to be visible to the unaided eye and would probably be retained in the meat after butchering. People in communities that depend heavily on hunting for subsistence are likely to be most exposed.\"</p>",
  "<p>A South African doctor who dedicated himself to saving the lives of black children from cancer throughout the apartheid era has been refused bail by a court in Abu Dhabi, where years ago he was accused and convicted without his knowledge of killing a young leukaemia patient.</p> <p>Cyril Karabus pioneered treatment for cancer and blood disorders at the Red Cross hospital in Cape Town, where he worked for 35 years, and trained numerous doctors at Cape Town University, some of whom work at the Great Ormond Street and Whittington hospitals in London.</p> <p>Now 77, he has been returned to the jail in Abu Dhabi where he has been confined for the last two months. \"He is an old, frail and very sickly man,\" said his lawyer, Michael Bagraim. \"He has no travel documents or any means of escaping or jumping bail. There doesn't seem to be any heart in what is taking place.</p> <p>\"My reports from people who were in the court were that the man appears to be broken. He was hunched. He was shackled. He is almost 78 and he has a pacemaker and a stent because of problems with his heart. He appears to have his spirit broken as well. Yet the man has not done anything wrong.\"</p> <p>The first Karabus knew of the 10-year-old criminal conviction against him was after he was arrested at Dubai airport on 18 August as he changed flights on his way home from his son's wedding in Canada. He had no knowledge of a complaint about his treatment, 12 years ago, of a three-year-old child while he was working as a locum at the Sheikh Khalifa Medical Centre in Abu Dhabi. He had reached retirement age in South Africa but loved his work and could not, in any case, afford to get by on a state pension.</p> <p>His daughter Sarah, a paediatrician in Cape Town, who was travelling with him, said: \"We have all been completely traumatised by it. We are a big family. We were together for the first time in years at my brother's wedding. We came from a joyous occasion and then this happened. The family is depressed and angry.\"</p> <p>They had all been given 24-hour visas to go to a hotel because they had a 10-hour stopover in Dubai. When they returned to board the plane, she and her husband and two children went through the passport check before her parents, so she did not see what happened next.</p> <p>\"My mother said they were standing at passport control when a man in a suit came up to him and said: 'Come with me, I'm police.' My father asked his name. He said: 'I don't have to tell you, I'm police.' My mother was given five minutes with him. She was told she couldn't stay in the country.\"</p> <p>The family said they all believed it must have been a mistake, or at least that he would be allowed home while he challenged the conviction. However, Karabus has been in jail ever since, even though his lawyers had the original conviction overturned on the basis that he had not been told of the complaint, and therefore had not had a chance to defend himself.</p> <p>He faces new charges of manslaughter and was refused bail at the fourth hearing in the case, at which authorities were given more time to find the files, which have all gone missing.</p> <p>\"They can't even find the files to make the allegations,\" Bagraim said. \"They can't find the family of the deceased girl. They have nothing.</p> <p>\"He is probably one of the leading experts in paediatric oncology. He is telling the court, 'I have done nothing wrong and if I had to do it again, I would do the same thing'. This was acute leukaemia. The kid was going to die anyway. There was nothing he could do but make her comfortable.\"</p> <p>The World Medical Association, an international organisation representing doctors, has written to the United Arab Emirates justice minister to express its \"deep concern about Professor Karabus and the state of his health\", and its surprise that he has not been granted bail. It said it would follow any trial closely.</p> <p>Many other doctors have expressed support, and Sarah Karabus said she was answering 80 to 100 emails a day from wellwishers. Her father has been moved to the medical wing of the prison where he is being held, and has been allowed a chess set and some books.</p> <p>Bagraim said the South African government did not want to interfere in another country's justice system, but he felt it could do more. \"He [Karabus] has done the country proud. He saved the lives of the poorest of the poor. During the apartheid system, he concentrated on helping children of colour, so much so that he is an impoverished man himself today.\" The next hearing is set for 11 October.</p>",
  "<p>I suspect Andrew Mitchell has a recurring dream. Every morning, as the first birds sing and before the morning papers land with a sickening thud on his doorstep, he begins to twitch in his sleep. Mrs Mitchell knows the signs. There will be no more sleep for her this dawn. She sighs.</p> <p>In his dream, the chief whip is riding his bike along Downing Street from number 12. He nears the gates at the end. A policeman steps forward: \"Excuse me sir, would you mind dismounting, and wheeling your bicycle through the pedestrian gate?\"</p> <p>\"Why, of course, officer,\" Mr Mitchell replies. \"In the past your colleagues have been kind enough to open the main gates for me, but I do appreciate that they may have been bending the rules, if ever so slightly! You, however, are merely doing your job in difficult and possibly dangerous circumstances, and I will be more than happy to comply with your wishes.\"</p> <p>As he dreams on, the policeman gives him a respectful salute, and moments later he is back on his bike, wobbling down Whitehall towards a well-deserved dinner at the Carlton Club.</p> <p>Then, suddenly and without warning, he wakes up, screaming! He has the opposite of that moment of utter relief we feel on waking from a nightmare realising it hasn't happened. But it has! The waking horror continues once more, all over again, unceasingly!</p> <p>And that is certainly what Labour wants. They are still milking this event for everything they can. On Wednesday the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, used it as yet another reason why, in her view, Labour has become the law and order party.</p> <p>Boris Johnson had said that people who swear at the police should be arrested. \"Except, it seems, in Downing Street. It really comes to something when the prime minister and the government chief whip are reprimanded for their lack of respect by a fellow member of the Bullingdon Club!\"</p> <p>All the buzz words, and the buzz thoughts are there. Privilege, arrogance, contempt for public servants. Limitless bliss for Labour.</p> <p>Ed Miliband answered questions from party members at the conference . The transformation of the gawky geek over the past year has been extraordinary. He looked calm, relaxed, confident. He was more like a slightly old-fashioned TV host \u2013 Val Doonican perhaps \u2013 than a political leader. After a while I realised that he was flirting with the party, making mildly risqu\u00e9 jokes, tickling the ladies' fancies. \"I remember kissing you! \u2026 a great-grandmother? You don't look old enough!\"</p> <p>He could even get away with a little lecture. After past defeats the party had turned inward. \"We took leave of the electorate, and we took leave of our senses.\"</p> <p>Not now. The message was clear: stick with me, and we'll win. It might not be true, but it left them sighing with pleasure. Unlike Mrs Mitchell.</p>",
  "<p>In February this year, I met Bob Brooks for dinner near his home in Monaco and he was, as ever, charming, funny, thoughtful and softly spoken. I found myself wondering what had happened to the brash, fearsome American exile I had heard about, who terrorised London film sets in the 1970s and 80s. For decades, Brooks possessed the most fiery reputation in advertising. \"Yes,&#xa0;I&#xa0;had a reputation when I came over from New York in the 60s,\" he&#xa0;admitted. \"I was angry and would&#xa0;shout and scream. But that's because&#xa0;I&#xa0;took the work so seriously.\"</p> <p>It was this intense seriousness that made Brooks the most prolific and influential director of his generation. From the Smash Martians (<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/572903.stm\" title=\"\">voted the best ad of all time by Campaign magazine</a>) to the immortal <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv1VQ7uSC-s\" title=\"\">JR Hartley ad for Yellow Pages</a>, Brooks shot some of the 20th century's most memorable, warm and funny ads.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uKt-KR1TsRg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uKt-KR1TsRg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> <a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uKt-KR1TsRg\">Reading on a mobile? Click here.</a> <br>It was the ideas and working practices he brought with him from New York's thriving advertising scene that made waves in London. \"When we&#xa0;made the Smash ads, I decided I&#xa0;wanted to shoot the tin puppets like they were real actors,\" he told me. \"But there was this one fucking puppet&#xa0;that kept getting everything wrong. So I lost my temper and started&#xa0;to shout at it.\" The ad's writer, John Webster, witnessed this explosion on set: \"Bob went berserk at this Martian. He had to be held back from attacking the thing.\"</p> <p>Before Brooks and his generation, most ads were shot by out-of-work movie directors or photographers who didn't take the medium seriously; shooting commercials was seen as slumming it. Brooks wanted to raise the bar. \"I knew I had to fight to change the way people thought about advertising,\" he said. \"It was a point of pride that we did the work properly, to a very high standard. If we Americans brought anything over to London, it was what we saw as a sense of&#xa0;professionalism.\"</p> <p>Brooks arrived in the UK in 1961, fresh from Madison Avenue, where \u2013 as we know from <a href=\"http://www.amctv.com/shows/mad-men\" title=\"\">Mad Men</a> \u2013 the American business had undergone a revolution of its own, eschewing the hard sell in favour of witty, smart, engaging advertising. Brooks rallied a small group of fellow creatives to form&#xa0;the Design and Art Direction Association (D&amp;AD) in 1962. The <a href=\"http://www.dandad.org/awards\" title=\"\">annual D&amp;AD awards</a> have remained the industry's gold standard ever since.&#xa0;\"Previously, no awards had named the individuals responsible for the work, just the agency,\" said Brooks.&#xa0;\"I wanted to change that.\" Writers and&#xa0;designers now had exposure and&#xa0;incentive. Ambition and competitiveness reigned. Agencies coveted their rivals' top talent and salaries started to spiral as a poaching&#xa0;culture set in.</p> <p>By the 1970s, Brooks had quit his agency job to become a director and, most years, swept the board at the awards ceremony he had helped devise. From <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hU7H6tNTLYc\" title=\"\">Pepsi's \"Lip-smacking, thirst-quenching Pepsi\" campaign</a> to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEfKEzX9QLE\" title=\"\">Maureen Lipman for BT</a>, via JR Hartley and Smash, the plaudits kept coming. Brooks was described as \"crabby\" and \"aggressive\" by some who worked with him, but no one questioned his professionalism or technical skill. Film and former ad director Alan Parker recalls: \"Being American, [Brooks] was the link between the New York style of commercials of the 1960s and the work that followed here, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYH2WMGq8c0\" title=\"\">by myself</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNy-7jv0XSc\" title=\"\">Ridley [Scott]</a> \u2013 we greatly benefited from the groundwork he laid. In many ways he was responsible for the revolutionary look of commercials, which was adopted in feature films.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nv1VQ7uSC-s?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nv1VQ7uSC-s\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> <a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nv1VQ7uSC-s\">Reading on a mobile?

His&#xa0;one feature film, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083178/\" title=\"\">Tattoo</a>, was a moderate success in 1981, but he may have lacked the necessary diplomacy when it came to dealing with the big studios. At any rate, he loved making commercials \u2013 and had an acute understanding of how they worked. His ads made people laugh but, as anyone who remembers the look on JR&#xa0;Hartley's face when he finally tracks down that beaten copy of Fly Fishing knows, they could touch people deeply, too. \"When I first came to the UK, the ads were funny but there was a reluctance to get too emotional,\" Brooks told me. \"As an American, I had no problem with sentiment. Why do you think there are so many dogs and babies in commercials? Because the consumer responds to it!\"</p> <p>\u2022 Sam Delaney is the author of Get Smashed: The Story of the Men Who Made the Adverts That Changed Our Lives (Sceptre)</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 October to correct a typo in the standfirst.</p>",
  "<p>Since the death of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jdsalinger\" title=\"\">JD Salinger</a>, one of my biggest regrets as an interviewer is that Caryl Churchill declines to speak publicly about her work. It's a resolution she has stuck to through the quarter century in which she has established herself as one of theatre's most innovative and provocative dramatists. Tantalisingly, there have now been two new plays within a month that journalists can't ask her about: today, the Royal Court in&nbsp;London premieres <a href=\"http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/ding-dong-the-wicked\" title=\"\">Ding Dong the Wicked</a>, a half-hour drama that will run alongside <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/sep/15/love-and-information-royal-court-review\" title=\"\">Love and Information</a>, the enthusiastically reviewed full-length play that opened there three weeks ago.</p> <p>In the light of Churchill's silence, I talked to a number of people who have worked with her instead. Flexibility, it rapidly emerges, is a key quality for her collaborators. The plays about which the writer won't speak tend to emerge out of silence themselves. Nick Hern, who has published Churchill's plays for 40 years, first at Methuen and now at <a href=\"http://www.nickhernbooks.co.uk/\" title=\"\">his own company, NHB</a>, says: \"The plays just turn up, without warning. I think she's one of those shamanistic writers, in the way Harold Pinter was. A play isn't planned or premeditated; it's scratching an itch. They come to me \u2013 originally in the post, now by email \u2013 and I sit down to read them, having absolutely no idea what the length or subject matter or form will be.\"</p> <p>John Tydeman, the former head of BBC radio drama, has directed half a dozen Churchill radio plays, starting with Lovesick in 1966; he also staged her play Objections to Sex and Violence, at the Royal Court in 1975. Even as a young writer, he remembers, Churchill was unusual in not seeking payment or contracts in advance. \"We never commissioned her. Even with a work that had taken a great deal of historical research, such as one called Schreber's Nervous Illness, the play would just turn up in the post.\"</p> <p>This is still the case, says Dominic Cooke, artistic director of the Royal Court. \"The plays aren't usually formally commissioned. So, in that sense, they just turn up on my desk. I have no idea what I'm getting.\" The late addition to this autumn's repertoire of Ding Dong the Wicked marks the second time the author has turned up at rehearsal with a second new play. The actor <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0179680/\" title=\"\">Allan Corduner</a> was rehearsing <a href=\"http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/ice-cream-1989\" title=\"\">Ice-Cream</a> at the Royal Court in 1989 when, he says, \"Caryl came in and said: 'I've just written another new play. Are you up for it?\" Called Hot Fudge, an allusion to the other play, Corduner recalls that this unexpected extra was \"rehearsed and staged in record time\".</p> <p>As well as challenging theatre schedules, Churchill's plays have a long&nbsp;record of testing production possibilities. \"The exciting thing about Caryl,\" says Cooke, \"is that she always tends to break new ground. The degree of innovation is extraordinary. Every play almost reinvents the form of theatre.\" And not just theatre: among her radio plays with Tydeman was Identical Twins (1968), in which the title characters were men who, the writer specified, should be played by one actor, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0354078/\" title=\"\">Kenneth Haigh</a>, whose speeches would overlap. Decades before digital editing made such effects effortless, Tydeman needed to work with broadcasting's best technicians. \"Kenneth had to record the second speech while we played the first one back, and it turned out that it was almost impossible to do that (keeping pace with your own voice) for more than 30 or 40 seconds at a time. So we had to put the play together in very small takes.\"</p> <p>Churchill's interest in vocal counterpoint has continued, and tested Hern at Methuen. \"We were sitting one day and Caryl said: 'I want to have overlapping dialogue.' And I said: 'Oh, my God, how are we going to do that?' And we worked it out, using a forward slash, and even put a little example of how it would work at the front of the script. And now it's an absolutely standard way of laying out a play.\"</p> <p>Even before that, the writer had asked for a specific and unusual layout of her scripts (character names set to the left, with a uniform gap before the dialogue began). Hern's experience of her polite but precise insistence is echoed in stories from the rehearsal room. Cooke, who directs Ding Dong the Wicked, says: \"She is a very strong presence in rehearsals. And there is a combination of being very open to suggestion \u2013 she enjoys the process of collaboration \u2013 but also of being very specific about what she wants in some cases.\"</p> <p>Tydeman agrees, finding the writer \"diffident and quiet, willing to listen to&nbsp;advice but with firmly held views on&nbsp;certain aspects of the text or production\". It's an experience shared by Michelene Wandor, a dramatist who worked with Churchill on the multi-author cabaret Floorshow (1977); she says that, \"while friendly, Caryl kept herself very much to herself\". Perhaps because of her public invisibility, Churchill is often described as shy, but Corduner, who also appeared in the economic comedy <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_pB6aDaExA\" title=\"\">Serious Money</a> (1987), has a different reading: \"She is so confident about her work that she can discuss it without defensiveness. She's completely non-dogmatic. During rehearsal, she is absolutely clear-headed about what does and doesn't work, which is quite rare in writers. She is entirely without ego.\"</p> <p>Tydeman hints at a private stability that underlies this quiet certainty. \"One of the things that always strikes me about her is that I think she's the only person in my address book who is still living at the same house she was living in in the early 1960s.\" He has never met Churchill's husband, David Harter, a campaigning solicitor, but she&nbsp;would often refer, during their working years, to her three sons and \"writing the plays at the kitchen table\".</p> <p>Churchill prefers to discuss form or&nbsp;effects in rehearsal, rather than meaning. \"She talks more in general terms,\" says Corduner. \"She trusts actors and doesn't want to tread on your territory.\" When he was having trouble finding a character in Serious Money, she gently replied that she couldn't help. But when the actor's solution involved mimicking Churchill's own speech \u2013 \"She has a slight soft-r sound\" \u2013 she agreed at once. Tydeman says: \"We never talked about feminism, for example. It was just there. Caryl's view was always that the plays would speak for themselves. Which, as you know, is also the attitude that she takes to interviews.\"</p> <p>Ah, the interviews. As I can't put the question to Churchill herself, I asked her collaborators if they knew why she refused to talk about her work. \"I've never discussed her refusal to do publicity,\" insists Cooke. \"We just accept that that will be the situation with each play.\" Possibly because, as a publisher, he feels this refusal most keenly, Hern <em>has</em> had the conversation. \"Oh, yes. Back at Methuen, I would come out of editorial meetings, having been asked if I could get Caryl to do this or that to promote the books. And I&nbsp;discussed it with her and she said: 'I really don't like talking about my work. It makes me self-conscious when I come to write the next thing.' She said that, if she became analytical about the plays, she was worried that whatever it is that produces them will go away. It was always about creative self-consciousness. It wasn't: 'I vant to be alone.'\"</p> <p>Another thing Churchill's people agree on is that critics focus too much on her structural jumps. \"I'm most impressed by dialogue, rather than the&nbsp;form,\" says Wandor, \"which has, I&nbsp;think, always had uncertainties about it. The elliptical, quasi-poetic quality of&nbsp;the dialogue is the most interesting element.\" Cooke concurs: \"I don't think she's been given enough credit for the quality of her dialogue \u2013 the way she captures a situation or a character in just a few lines.\"</p> <p>In the unlikely event that Churchill ever agreed to an interview, one question that might come up would be the fact that \u2013 from Tydeman to Cooke, Stephen Daldry and James Macdonald at the Court \u2013 she has worked almost exclusively with male directors. \"Mmm. Isn't that interesting?\" says Tydeman. \"I think at the start it was happenstance rather than choice, because the men were rather in the majority. But it is interesting that it continued.\" Wandor says: \"I've never discussed it with her. But I think it is true that to have had major theatrical success, male directors still seem pretty pivotal, and the management/directing by Max Stafford-Clark [her longterm collaborator at the Royal Court] was crucial to the successes of the earlier work.\"</p> <p>Corduner admits the question has occurred to him. \"I have been very conscious of that during rehearsals. But I've never discussed it with her. I think, although she's clearly a feminist and stands for many things feminism admires, she doesn't judge people by gender. I've never detected a yearning to have her work directed by women. Again, it's that confidence.\"</p> <p>Has her diffidence when it comes to&nbsp;interviews had an effect on her reputation? The final word goes to Tydeman, who says, \"I'm talking about&nbsp;working with [Caryl], but I was always struck by how little work was needed. Her plays \u2013 like those of Tom Stoppard, with whom I also worked \u2013 always arrived fully made. I'd put her up there&nbsp;with Stoppard, although her reputation may be lower than it should be \u2013 because she has chosen to stay in the background.\"</p>",

So it came as a considerable surprise to her mother, Cecilia, that an official assessment of her daughter's abilities classified her as someone who would be capable of finding work in the near future.</p> <p>The report contained a number of factual errors, perhaps most remarkably the assessor's description of the 27-year-old as a \"male client\", but more disturbing for Anim was the conclusion of the doctor who carried out the test: \"I advise that a return to work could be considered within 12 months.\"</p> <p>Anim says: \"For Ruth to go to work is actually totally unimaginable. She can't even cross the road without someone going with her; she doesn't know that if a car hits you it will kill you; she has no concept of danger.\" Her daughter was born with complex medical needs, learning disabilities, a heart problem and epilepsy. \"She is somebody who has a one-to-one carer \u2013 is she meant to go to work with her carer?\"</p> <p>As a result of the assessment, Ruth was assigned to a category known as the work related activity group, and required to attend the jobcentre regularly to begin mandatory preparations for going to work.</p> <p>Cecilia Anim's amazement at the written report, describing her daughter's work capability assessment (WCA), the test to determine fitness for work, echoes the shock felt by hundreds of thousands of former claimants of incapacity benefit over the last three years, after undergoing the stringent new computerised test to check their continued eligibility for benefit payments.</p> <p>Since the test was introduced in 2008 more than 600,000 people have appealed against the assessments; the cost to the state of those appeals has risen from \u00a325m in 2009-10 to \u00a360m in 2011-12. About 38% of those who appeal against an initial fit-for-work finding see that decision overturned on appeal and benefits granted. Welfare rights organisations and charities have voiced consistent unease about the test and the way doctors employed by the private IT firm Atos, which is paid \u00a3100m a year by the government to carry out the test, have implemented it.</p> <p>Last week Labour called for a \"fast and radical\" overhaul of the system, admitting the policy it introduced when in government was not working.</p> <p>As deputy president of the Royal College of Nursing, Anim can project her fury about the experience her daughter endured far more powerfully than most individuals going through the system. This awareness has heightened her desire to talk about the \"injustice of the process\", to educate people about how inaccurate the assessments can be.</p> <p>\"I am able to fight back, but what about the people who are not able to fight back? It's causing a lot of problems for a lot of people,\" she says. \"My daughter's consultant neurologist was beside himself with fury when I told him. The first question he asked was, 'Have they done a risk assessment?' \"</p> <p>Ruth's case is by no means exceptional. Mencap, the charity which supports people with a learning disability, says it has seen countless similarly surprising cases of misclassification of vulnerable clients, many of whom are told they are not eligible for any sickness or disability benefit and must seek work immediately.</p> <p>The principle underlying the WCA is that a health condition or disability should not automatically be regarded as a barrier to work, and in theory the policy is designed to ensure that support is available to help people find work. Anim says there is nothing she would like more than for her daughter to find a job, just as she would like her to get married and have the kind of life her contemporaries have, but she argues that, given the severity of her daughter's condition, this approach is not realistic.</p> <p>The 45-minute examination was chaotic from start to finish, Anim says. Her daughter was extremely anxious and kept asking the doctor if he was going to take a blood test. She refused to sit down and hopped on and off the medical examining couch when the doctor was talking to her. Anim points to a line in the partly computer-generated report which notes \"client was able to sit on a chair with a back for 45 minutes\".</p> <p>\"The whole examination was very chaotic and bizarre because she was not co-operating. But in his report he has put that Ruthie sat for 45 minutes. She never sat down for more than three minutes. She was all over the place,\" she says. \"At one point she went to the tap and washed her hands and started spraying the water everywhere. He raised his voice and said 'Stop doing that!' I said no, no, don't speak to her like that. She's got learning difficulties; she doesn't understand.\"</p> <p>A few questions the doctor asked, about her daughter's condition and her schooling, made Anim doubt his familiarity with the British care system. He noted in his report that her daughter's speech was normal, although Anim had done most of the speaking. The few questions Ruth managed to respond to were answered inaccurately. \"He asked her how old she was and she said 18, despite the fact that she is 27,\" she says.</p> <p>A few months after the medical assessment Ruth was called to an interview at the jobcentre to discuss finding work. She went with her mother, who was aghast when she understood why they had been called in. \"I said 'Are you having a laugh?'\" The jobcentre adviser realised very quickly that a mistake had been made. \"We sat down, and every question she asked her, Ruth raised her palms as if she didn't know the answer. She asked 'What day is it?'; Ruthie said Thursday, but it was Tuesday. She asked 'What time is it?'. She said 5.30pm, but it was 2.30pm,\" she recalls. \"Ruth was rummaging through the tray on her desk and being disruptive. She kept saying, 'What's your name?'\"</p> <p>\"They said she must come every three weeks to show that she is actively seeking work,\" Anim says; but the adviser also told her that she could appeal against the decision. \"It only took her 10 minutes to realise that the decision was wrong.\"</p> <p>Anim spent her summer holiday trying to sort out the problem, marshalling the support of her local MP, Glenda Jackson, and a welfare rights organisation, Brent Association of Disabled People, as well as contacting Atos and the DWP.</p> <p>The decision caused immense stress to the whole family, she says. \"As a nurse I know what effect this has on families. You have to constantly struggle to get the support to meet her basic needs. After all we have gone through, then to be told she needs to look for work. She was totally oblivious to what was going on, as usual, but we felt disbelief, frustration, stress and shock.</p> <p>\"It was a barmy decision. People with learning disabilities need all the support they can get. [They should] not be put in this situation where there is total ignorance about their ability to work, safety and wellbeing.\"</p> <p>Although the Royal College of Nursing has no official position on the WCA, Anim is clear that the policy needs urgent reform. \"The system needs to be overhauled and reviewed.\"</p> <p>The DWP says that it has introduced numerous improvements to the testing process, but charities state that serious problems continue. A report published by Citizens Advice earlier this year found a \"worryingly low\" level of accuracy in the assessments. The charity, which supports many people who feel they have been wrongly denied benefits through the appeals process, has seen a 71% increase in workload relating to the employment and support allowance (the replacement to incapacity benefit) over the past two years.</p> <p>Campaigners blame both the design of the policy and the way it has been implemented for the problems. The headquarters of Atos have been repeatedly targeted by disabled protesters, angry at the company's involvement in the assessments, and the company's sponsorship of the Paralympics caused widespread controversy.</p> <p>The National Audit Office criticised the Department for Work and Pensions in August for not having \"sought financial redress for contractor underperformance\" and recommended that it \"tighten performance requirements with Atos in relation to the quality of medical assessments\".</p> <p>Earlier this year delegates at the BMA conference passed a motion stating that the \"inadequate computer-based assessment\" performed by Atos had \"little regard for the nature or complexity of the needs of long-term sick and disabled persons\", and proposed that the WCA should be halted \"with immediate effect\".</p> <p>Jane Alltimes, senior policy officer at Mencap, said Ruth's case was not particularly extreme. Mencap has submitted recommendations for improvement to the system to the DWP, and is arguing for greater recognition of employers' unwillingness to employ people with learning disabilities. Just 7% of people who receive state support for their learning disabilities are in work.</p> <p>\"The evidence we've seen suggests an assessment process that isn't working for lots of people with a learning disability. An assessment designed to determine a person's 'fitness for work' needs to take into account the realities of the barriers experienced by disabled people in getting a job \u2013 things like job availability, the prejudices of employers, the support people need to overcome the barriers they face. The assessment in its current form just doesn't do that.\"</p> <p>An Atos Healthcare spokesperson said: \"We apologise for any discrepancy in our report and any distress this may have caused. We carry out around 15,000 assessments each week and work hard to provide the DWP with as much detailed information as we can to contribute to them making an accurate decision on benefits.\"</p> <p>A DWP spokesperson said: \"The work capability assessment is under constant review to ensure it is both fair and effective, and it is in everyone's interest to get the system right. We are committed to help thousands of people move from benefits and back into work while giving unconditional support to those who are most in need.\"</p>",

  "<p>We've seen him on the telly, but here he was in real life. Kevin Pietersen's suit was familiar, but perhaps there was not so much hair gel; certainly there were not so many smiles. He might have been going to a funeral. Clearly this was to be a sombre occasion.</p> <p>Instead of an impish Sourav Ganguly, Pietersen had Giles Clarke alongside him and their chemistry was not quite so obvious. Clarke did most of the talking and aimed for gravitas. He spoke so earnestly and solemnly of the \"reintegration process\" that any intruder from beyond the old commonwealth, who does not understand the beautiful intricacies of the game of cricket, might have assumed that Pietersen had, at the very least, stolen his granny's life savings.</p> <p>But Clarke also spoke of a forgiving society and \"civilised and sensible ethics\", all of which sounded like good liberal stuff. For a moment we had to check under the table for suede shoes just to confirm that this was indeed Giles doing the talking, rather than Ken. The ECB was in magnanimous mood.</p> <p>The silent Pietersen was obviously the beneficiary of their generosity of spirit. Then Clarke mentioned the apology from the silent man to his left and it began to dawn on us all that no one was quite sure what Pietersen was apologising for any more. Apparently those texts were merely provocative rather than derogatory. Later Pietersen would clarify: he was apologising \"for the situation that has arisen over the last couple of months\".</p> <p>After that enlightenment we were assured that \"the process of reintegration\" had begun. In fact there is nothing much new in the \"reintegration process\". In another era after the odd falling-out cricketers would often come together and then they would get as reintegrated as parrots. And the following day a few of those rifts would be healed. Apparently it is not so simple now. This time \"the reintegration process\" may be as complicated as the London/Delhi air schedules.</p> <p>Pietersen looked rather more nervous reading out his prepared statement than he does when he is merrily ad-libbing with Ganguly or Dermot Reeve in the studio. He said that he was committed to completing \"the reintegration process\" and assured us that his son would be prepared to represent England when the time came. Perhaps the ECB had insisted upon that as part of the agreement: Pietersen Sr \u2013 injuries permitting \u2013 to be committed until 2015 World Cup; Pietersen Jr would be available until 2035 \u2013 with the proviso that Andy Flower was happy to have the young man in the team.</p> <p>Once Pietersen had delivered his script it became apparent that the two men behind the table had, of course, been getting on famously after their two and a half hours of discussion before the press conference. It was \"Kevin\" and \"Giles\", not Mr Pietersen and the Chairman. Things were looking up.</p> <p>Then there were questions, three of them to be precise. No more than that were allowed and those permitted to ask them had been handpicked by the ECB, who were not looking quite so liberal any more. Sky TV was followed by the Times and, just to ensure that Mr Murdoch did not have a monopoly, the Daily Mail.</p> <p>Michael Atherton, a jetlagged former England captain, looked on quizzically and enviously. How he would have loved to choose his interrogators at those interminable press conferences he so detested when he was in charge. But even young Atherton is now from a bygone age. He recalled how even in his time \"tricky\" characters were occasionally pinioned to the dressing&#xa0;room wall and told their life story \u2013 before everyone retired to the pub. How Neanderthal.</p>",
  "<p>Jimmy Savile, laid out in state in Leeds, revered as a great eccentric, gave a lot of&#xa0;us the creeps for decades. Women are now telling us how he raped them when they were children. We say in our jaded way: \"Well, really, who knew?\" Lots of people, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/03/bbc-jimmy-savile-abuse-claims\" title=\"\">as&#xa0;far back as 1973</a>. Either the rumours could not be printed as \"the girls\" would not identify themselves, or he scuppered them by threatening to pull his work for \"charidee\". What if a few \"girls\" got a quick one from a superstar DJ? That's a small price to pay for the amount of money Savile raised for Stoke Mandeville, isn't it?</p> <p>Anyway it's just what happened at the time. Not all of it was that glamorous, \"I'm with the band\" stuff. Jimmy Page was teaching a 14-year-old the tricks of the trade. The late, great John Peel was getting married for the first time to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/oct/16/biography.johnpeel\" title=\"\">\"an underage girl\"</a> he claimed had lied about her age. And I was being groped in the store cupboard by a wheezing shop owner. It was the price you paid for a Saturday job and we mostly avoided him. It was probably our own fault anyway for being vaguely female and wearing those sexy supermarket overalls. When I&#xa0;did meet <a href=\"http://www.pameladesbarres.com/\" title=\"\">Pamela Des Barres</a>, top Led Zeppelin groupie, I found hers a sad ambition and was glad to be of another generation. She had to kid herself she was a muse, until, of course, Page replaced her with an actual&#xa0;kid.</p> <p>Liking \"young girls\", never \"children\", was just a preference in a \"gentlemen prefer blondes\" way. I say no: this is not a preference, it is a perversion. It was in the 70s, and it is now, and I don't know what men my age are playing at defending this behaviour. Would they want their daughters <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2211529/Can-Mandy-Smith-13-year-old-girl-seduced-Rolling-Stone-Bill-Wyman-boost-Appeal.html\" title=\"\">marrying a Bill Wyman</a>? I sat aghast as <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/jimmy-savile-met-launches-investigation\" title=\"\">Michael Grade</a> and David Hepworth were interviewed on Channel 4 News. Wasn't it all so louche then, what with Jerry Lee Lewis and his 13-year-old bride, and didn't every \"girl\" dream of being on Top of the Pops? You just couldn't move for \"groupies\". Savile is accused among other things of abusing children in an approved school in Staines. Rock'n'roll?</p> <p>Are we still in the dark ages about what constitutes abuse and what constitutes consent? Apparently so. We may have arguments about the age of consent and whether lowering it, as in Spain or Italy, to 14, may make it more enforceable. What is not in doubt though is that what Savile was accused of was not consensual. The BBC must account for itself, for this looks like a systematic coverup. The details from the women are gut-wrenching. The trackie bottoms easily whipped off; the women who forgive him but cannot forgive themselves.</p> <p>Many of our best journalists hinted at it but could not stand up these stories, partly because we continue with this ambivalent attitude to teenage girls. If Savile had abused boys, would it have been different? God knows. Like many a hack I have received enough bizarrely enormous Christmas cards from Jonathan King, who maintains not only his innocence but that his artistic credibility is comparable to Oscar Wilde.</p> <p>But why are we so murky on the issue of consent? Do we secretly believe all women have to be pressured into sex except the ones that do it for a chicken korma? I refer, of course, to the girls in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/rochdale-child-sex-ring\" title=\"\">Rochdale \"grooming\" case</a>. These were children, but referred to by those \"safeguarding\" them as prostitutes. How can children be prostitutes? We don't believe what teenage girls say, while at the same time bemoaning their \"sexualisation\", which mostly comes down to wearing what is fashionable or actually school uniform. Sexual abuse, the abuse of power, happens within a culture that believes that sex&#xa0;education leads to sex, that abuse is a fairly modern invention and that only the nuclear family can protect children from it. All these things are untrue.</p> <p>Children cannot give consent to have sex with adults: that's the law. We can stick with that. The argument that \"I thought she was older/asking for it/would do it for a bag of chips\" is utterly vile and&#xa0;irrelevant.</p> <p>Sadly, I wish I was more shocked, but I have worked in enough jobs, and I include the media, where the sexual harassment of young women is condoned or ignored by \"decent\" men. In one liberal establishment we were gathered together by the boss to be told that sexual harassment was a dreadful business that happened in America. We&#xa0;women rolled our eyes. If grownup women's complaints are not to be taken seriously, what hope for a frightened 14-year-old girl?</p> <p>Still, even when girls are believed, abusers are forgiven. Look at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski_sexual_abuse_case\" title=\"\">Roman Polanksi</a>. A 13-year-old testified he had drugged and sodomised her, but, yes, he does make great films. When I spent the day with him, he was perfectly open about his sexual preferences. He likes them young, and&#xa0;it made me feel ill. \"Great artist does bad things\" is not news. Savile was not a great artist and known in the business as \"Jim'll Fuck It\". All of this was a very long time ago, as we keep being reminded. Those were the days, my friend, those guys thought they would never end. The terrible thing is, they haven't.</p>",
  "<p>Received wisdom says that Roger Moore was the worst 007, the one who turned James Bond into a caricature. Rubbish, of course. How do you turn a character with no hinterland, no interests beyond bedding women and killing villains \u2013 and sometimes killing women \u2013 into a caricature? He already is a caricature. Bond is empty: Moore's treatment of him as a bored playboy, for whom the sex and violence are beads of sensation in a mundane world, is the only filmic reading of the character as written in the screenplays that makes any sense.</p> <p>Like albums by the Fall, the first Bond film you see is the one that leaves its residue upon you. This was mine: an unimaginably thrilling experience at the time, though less so from a distance of more than 35 years. In truth, The Man with the Golden Gun is rather flat: the jokes are forced and laboured (transplanting Clifton James's halfwit Louisiana sheriff JW Pepper from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/78442/live-and-let-die\">Live and Let Die</a> to Thailand for comic effect was particularly lazy); there's no great gadget from Q; the set pieces are few (though in the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzCIbhLUUA0\">corkscrewing car jump</a>, there was one genuine classic); and, for a Bond film, it's particularly talky, without ever being well-written.</p> <p>But there's something in The Man with the Golden Gun that points the way to the darker Bond of Timothy Dalton or Daniel Craig. It's there in his jousting with Scaramanga (Christopher Lee) \u2013 the three-nippled villain of the piece, an assassin who works for $1m a hit and has Bond on his list \u2013 who reminds 007 that the pair of them are cut from the same cloth. Indeed, in Tom Mankiewicz's first draft of the screenplay he posited Scaramanga as Bond's alter ego, \"a super-villain of the stature of Bond himself\". </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3mSVvuqwyOA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3mSVvuqwyOA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mSVvuqwyOA&amp;feature=player_embedded\">Reading on mobile? Click here</a></p> <p>The darkness is there, too, in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqCJqRhikDk\">the hall of mirrors</a> on Scaramanga's island, through which the assassin hunts his prey at the start and the end of the film: this is the one place in the film where uncertainty and fear and deception ring true. And it is there in Bond's unusually certain attitude towards his adversary, a man he admits he wouldn't mind killing in cold blood. It's even there in the gleeful cruelty of Scaramanga's dwarf sidekick, Nick Nack (an effortless assemblage of offensive notions in one sketchy character), who hires killers to take out his boss, with the boss's full approval. It's all useful practice, you see.</p> <p>Like its predecessor, The Man with the Golden Gun borrowed from the cinematic trends of the time. Live and Let Die borrowed from <a href=\"http://www.blaxploitation.com/\">blaxploitation</a>; The Man with the Golden Gun took a couple of kicks at kung fu, though in a distinctly half-hearted fashion. Its most memorable piece of violence, in fact, is never seen: when Bond takes his seat beside Scaramanga's girlfriend \u2013 who is to hand him a \"solex agitator\", the McGuffin of the film \u2013 it takes him a few moments to realise she's already been shot dead in her seat.</p> <p>The sad thing about The Man with the Golden Gun is how great it might have been. South-east Asia in the mid-70s? You'd think even the most inept scriptwriter might have conjured something out of events there \u2013 I believe there was <a href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/vietnam-war\">some sort of war going on nearby</a> \u2013 rather than an implausible assassin with a luxury hideout on a <a href=\"http://www.jamesbondisland.com/\">secret island</a>. Instead, the setting is just a background, as if the film were just a Duran Duran video with extra guns and safari suits.</p> <p>Perhaps, when real people were dying real deaths in a real war just around the corner from the setting, the cartoon anti-Communism of the 60s Bonds didn't seem entirely appropriate. American audiences might just have been furious at a Bond who sorted out the region's problems with an unzipped fly, a Walther pistol and some Savile Row tailoring, while their sons were dying thousands of miles from home.</p> <p>If this doesn't sound much like an appreciation of a favourite film, I have saved one point till last. Those of us who actually have third nipples are rarely represented on screen. In Scaramanga we got our hero.</p> <p><strong>Favourite line: </strong>(Delivered by Scaramanga) \"You see, Mr Bond, I always thought I loved animals. Then I discovered that I enjoyed killing people even more.\"</p> <p><strong>Favourite gadget:</strong> The wreck of the liner RMS Queen Elizabeth in Hong Kong harbour, which turns out to be MI6's regional HQ.</p>",
  "<p>A police force has closed down the Twitter accounts of four officers after Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) raised concerns about the content of their tweets.</p> <p>The move comes after a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/02/police-warned-treat-tweeters-with-care\" title=\"\">warning in the Guardian this week</a> by a senior police officer that the service risked looking \"out of touch and heavy-handed\" by coming down too hard on officers who made mistakes using social media , instead of providing more support and training.</p> <p>Northamptonshire police's action against four unnamed officers could be replicated in other forces across England and Wales. HMIC said it was visiting forces to follow up on its <a href=\"http://www.hmic.gov.uk/media/a-review-of-police-relationships-20111213.pdf\" title=\"\">Without Fear or Favour</a> report last year on police relations with the media, and would highlight any issues that had come up with the forces concerned.</p> <p>HMIC refused to flesh out what issues it had highlighted to the Northamptonshire force that had led its directorate of professional standards to close down the accounts. It said it could not comment until the publication of its follow-up report in a few months' time.</p> <p>The Guardian has highlighted the cases of two officers who have been disciplined in the last fortnight over their use of Twitter. In Devon and Cornwall, a police community safety officer in Topsham \u2013 tweeting as <a href=\"https://en.twitter.com/TopshamPolice\" title=\"\">@topshampolice</a> \u2013 said she was ordered off Twitter for comments she made about the policing of Exeter University students.</p> <p>Her force denied she had been banned from using the medium. This week after the Guardian article, the assistant chief constable of the force, Chris Boarland, said the officer was now undergoing training and it was more than \"entirely possible in the relatively near future\" that she would be allowed to tweet about her work again.</p> <p>\"No one is going to be banned from using social media, but there obviously need to be guidelines around it,\" Boarland said. \"She was doing a fantastic job on Twitter, and, hopefully, that will be continuing shortly.\"</p> <p>An acting inspector in the West Midlands is being disciplined by his force over his Twitter account.</p> <p>Northamptonshire police said its directorate of professional standards had taken action on Tuesday to close down the Twitter accounts of four out of its 45 accredited tweeters. A spokeswoman said HMIC had raised issues about certain tweets it deemed inappropriate. Reasons given, it is understood, were that some tweets might breach the Data Protection Act, for investigative and legal reasons.</p> <p>The force said its Facebook and Twitter pages were very popular. \"We aim to provide a real sense of policing in Northamptonshire and to share local policing activities with local people,\" the force said in a statement.</p> <p>\"We expect the highest standards from our officers and staff at all times and this is reflected in procedures regarding the use of social media across the force. This may be with regard to data protection, appropriateness of message and for investigative or legal reasons. We monitor the use of social media and at times it is necessary to ask for messages to be removed, adapted or indeed for an account to be closed.\"</p> <p>HMIC said it was following up issues raised in its Without Fear or Favour report published last December. \"We are currently in the process of carrying out this follow-up inspection,\" a spokeswoman said. \"As part of this process we provide feedback \u2013 we have highlighted some issues to the force and we understand they have taken action. We haven't yet made any recommendations in relation to this follow-up inspection.\"</p> <p>Gordon Scobbie, deputy chief constable of Tayside police, who speaks for the service on social media, told the Guardian this week that forces needed to be careful in the way they responded to mistakes made by officers.</p> <p>\"There is a fine balance to be struck,\" he said. \"Social media is a positive tool if used properly and forces need to be careful about the amount of control they have. It comes down to the culture of an organisation and the degree of trust you have in your frontline officers. You have to allow them to make mistakes and deal with them as a mistake, rather than coming down heavily on them. People who make mistakes should be supported, otherwise we are in danger of looking out of touch and heavy-handed.\"</p> <p>There are 1,000 approved police tweeters, who operate from force-accredited accounts with the approval of their senior officers. Many other officers tweet under pseudonyms, believing they can speak more freely as result.</p>",
  "<p>The only US sports column more ubiquitous and annoying than the \"Americans will never embrace soccer\" diatribe is the \"which EPL team should nascent American fans like\" article. Both nativists and anglophiles overlook two key facts: soccer and passionate supporters have existed in the US for decades. Granted, MLS has not yet fully expanded from sea to shining sea. Thus, a more relevant question for US soccer fans in remote locations is: \"Which MLS team should I follow?\" Rather than choose on championships, rosters, or goals, how about picking by supporters. Which fan groups boast the best songs and chants?</p> <p>No, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J2QdDbelmY\">\"Seven Nation Army\"</a> did not make this list. Yes, American band the White Stripes penned the tune. Yes, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18673916\">the song has replaced the vuvuzela as background noise for Euro soccer</a>. However, MLS Supporter Groups have their own refreshing tunes, chants, and rituals. I've witnessed many firsthand: growing up in Kansas City and also living in Washington, D.C. and Houston, Texas. </p> <h2>DC United: Vamos DC United</h2> <p>DC United fans have braved the dilapidated RFK stadium for several years. The evanescent promise of a new stadium would have worn out an average fan, but the Barra Brava continues to jump and cause a mini-earthquake in the 130 sections. They also sing a few songs. DC is a cosmopolitan town with a large Salvadoran population. In nearby Maryland, lots of South Americans immigrants inhabit Silver Spring. Thus, the Barra Brava sings some songs in Spanish, including the simple yet powerful \"Vamos DC United\" [Let's Go United]. The slow jam lyrics roughly translate to \"Let's Go....Let's Go United. Tonight...we've got to win!\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JVQVPUG-a2A?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JVQVPUG-a2A\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>.</p> <h2>Seattle Sounders: Seattle Sounders</h2> <p>Of course, some fans don't need songs to make a ruckus. During the last decade, many MLS teams have moved to smaller, soccer-specific stadiums to escape half-empty football stadiums and create atmosphere. Not so in Seattle. The fans, including Emerald City Supporters, have turned the NFL's QWest field into one of MLS's most daunting places to play. This call-and-repeat session is borderline deafening, even from the safety of your own sofa. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BBtt7xeWqDg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BBtt7xeWqDg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>.</p> <h2>Chicago Fire: Just Can't Get Enough</h2> <p>The Fire have several supporter's groups, and Section 8 is an association of those groups. The name comes from Section 8 of Soldier Field, the cavernous American Football Stadium where the Fire used to play. Before Toyota Park, the rowdy, loud, and standing fans gathered in Section 8. They've adopted a soccer song classic: Depeche Mode's \"I Just Can't Get Enough.\" </p> <p>In England, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99DRvMlu8nM\">Liverpool fans have adopted a version with different lyrics to serenade upon Luis Suarez</a>. In Scotland, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDPQILYRFg8\">Celtic fans belt the tune</a> at home games. The Section 8 version gets drowned out by the snare at times and relies a bit much on some \"duh duh duh\" filler, but you can feel the urgency in the air when they claim to be \"going out of my head.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NggBsm3ZIrc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NggBsm3ZIrc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>.</p> <h2>Portland Timbers: Can't Help Falling In Love</h2> <p>Portland fans, including the Timbers Army fan association, boast and belt a catalogue of great songs. However, my particular favorite is that Elvis Presley classic \"Can't Help Falling in Love.\" The song may lack the rat-a-tat chorus of 80's new wave beats, but the fans croon out \"Only Fools Rush In.....\" with disarming sincerity. The song reverberates amidst the stadium walls well after the last note is sung. A definite plus.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jFm-TzIWzt4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jFm-TzIWzt4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>.</p> <h2>Houston Dynamo: Yo Te Quiero Ver Campeon</h2> <p>Last, and my very favorite, Houston has a variety of supporters groups, some Anglo, some Hispanic, and most a fusion of both. The group known as Batallon sings this gem of a song \"Yo Te Quiero Ver Campeon\" [I want to see you champion]. Recognize the beat? It's taken from the reggaeton song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekFaaEU8Yuw\">Llamada de Emergencia by Daddy Yankee</a>. Instead of synthetic beats, a mini brass band belts out the notes.

  "<p>On 30 May, Dan Rather, one of America's best-known journalists, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/hugo-chavez-illness-dan-rather-2012-5\" title=\"\">announced</a> that Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez would die&#xa0;\"in a couple of months at most\". Four&#xa0;months later <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/02/hugo-chavez-strongmans-last-stand?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Ch\u00e1vez is not only alive and campaigning</a> but widely expected to win re-election on Sunday.</p> <p>Such is the state of misrepresentation of Venezuela \u2013 it is probably the most lied-about country in the world \u2013 that a journalist can say almost anything about Ch\u00e1vez or his government and it is unlikely to be challenged, so long as it is negative. Even worse, Rather referred to Ch\u00e1vez as \"the dictator\" \u2013 a term that few, if any, political scientists familiar with the country would countenance.</p> <p>Here is what <a href=\"http://cartercenter.org/news/multimedia/Conversations/30-years-of-the-carter-center.html\" title=\"\">Jimmy Carter said</a> about&#xa0;Venezuela's \"dictatorship\" a few weeks ago: \"As a matter of fact, of the 92&#xa0;elections that we've monitored, I would say that the election process in Venezuela is the best in the world.\"</p> <p>Carter won a Nobel prize for his work through the election-monitoring <a href=\"http://www.cartercenter.org/index.html\" title=\"\">Carter Center</a>, which has observed and certified past Venezuelan elections. But because Washington has sought for more than a decade to delegitimise Venezuela's government, his viewpoint is only rarely reported. His latest comments went unreported in almost all of the US media.</p> <p>In Venezuela, voters touch a computer screen to cast their vote and then receive a paper receipt, which they verify and deposit in a ballot box. Most of the paper ballots are compared with the electronic tally. This system makes vote-rigging nearly impossible: to steal the vote would require hacking the computers and then stuffing the ballot boxes to match the rigged vote.</p> <p>Unlike in the US, where in a close vote we really have no idea who won (see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_v._Gore\" title=\"\">Bush v Gore</a>), Venezuelans can be sure that their vote counts. And also unlike the US, where as many as 90 million eligible voters <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2012-08-15/non-voters-obama-romney/57055184/1\" title=\"\">will not vote in November</a>, the government in Venezuela has done <a href=\"http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/6934\" title=\"\">everything to increase voter registration</a> (now at a record of about 97%) and participation.</p> <p>Yet the US foreign policy establishment (which includes most of the American and western media) seethes with contempt for Venezuela's democratic process. In a report timed for the elections, the so-called Committee to Protect Journalists says that the government controls a \"media empire\", neglecting to inform its readers that Venezuelan state TV has&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/who-dominates-the-media-in-venezuela\" title=\"\">only about</a> 5-8% of the country's audience. Of course, Ch\u00e1vez can interrupt normal programming with his speeches (under a law that pre-dates his administration), and regularly does so. But the opposition still has most of the media, including radio and print media \u2013 not to mention most of the wealth and income of the country.</p> <p>The opposition will probably lose this election not because of the government's advantages of incumbency \u2013 which are abused throughout the hemisphere, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/20/us/politics/obama-exploits-familiar-junction-of-policy-and-politics.html\" title=\"\">including</a> the United States, but because the living standards of the majority of Venezuelans have <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/update-the-venezuelan-economy-in-the-chavez-years\" title=\"\">dramatically improved</a> under Ch\u00e1vez. Since 2004, when the government gained control over the oil industry and the economy had recovered from the devastating, extra-legal attempts to overthrow it (including the 2002 US-backed military coup and oil strike of 2002-2003), poverty has been <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/venezuelas-economic-recovery-is-it-sustainable\" title=\"\">cut in half</a> and extreme poverty by 70%. And this measures only cash income. Millions have access to healthcare for the first time, and college enrolment has doubled, with free tuition for many students. Inequality has also been considerably reduced. By contrast, the two decades that preceded Ch\u00e1vez amount to one of the worst economic failures in Latin America, with real income per person actually falling by 14% between 1980 and 1998.</p> <p>In Washington, democracy has a simple definition: does a government do what the state department wants it to do? And of course here, the idea of politicians actually delivering on what they promised to voters is also an unfamiliar concept. So it is not just Venezuela that regularly comes under fire from the Washington establishment: all of the left and newly independent governments of South America, including Argentina, Ecuador, and Bolivia are in the crosshairs (although Brazil is considered <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/apr/9/obamas-brazilian-model/\" title=\"\">too big to get the same treatment</a> except from the right). The state department tries to keep its eyes on the prize: Venezuela is sitting on 500bn barrels of oil, and doesn't respect Washington's foreign policy. That is what makes it public enemy number one, and gets it the worst media coverage.</p> <p>But Venezuela is part of a \"Latin American spring\" that has produced the most democratic, progressive, and independent group of governments that the region has ever had. They work together, and Venezuela has solid support among its neighbours. This is the former president of Brazil, Lula da Silva, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqBK49eWnkY&amp;feature=player_embedded#!\" title=\"\">last month</a>: \"A victory for Ch\u00e1vez is not just a victory for the people of Venezuela but also a victory for all the people of Latin America \u2026 this victory will strike another blow against imperialism.\"</p> <p>South America's support is Venezuela's best guarantee against continuing attempts by Washington \u2013 which is still spending <a href=\"http://transition.usaid.gov/performance/cbj/158267.pdf\" title=\"\">millions of dollars</a> within the country in addition to unknown covert funds \u2013 to undermine, delegitimise, and destabilise democracy in Venezuela.</p>",
  "<p>Whatever hot new names appear on the Paris fashion week schedule, Marc Jacobs says, his competition never changes. \"My goal is the same. Every time, I want to beat myself,\" he says.</p> <p>How to follow last season's epic Louis Vuitton show, a lavish 15-minute theatre piece in which a real steam train, in bespoke Louis Vuitton livery for the occasion, carried a phalanx of models to a catwalk in the shadow of the Louvre? Jacobs's answer was to wipe the slate clean, leaving behind the Anna Karenina romance and nostalgia of that collection for a mood of simplicity and purity.</p> <p>\"I wanted to get away from storytelling and do something very mathematical and geometric,\" said Jacobs backstage after Wednesday's show. The collection was inspired by Les Deux Plateaux, an abstract artwork by Daniel Buren that has dominated the courtyard of the nearby Palais-Royal since 1986. Les Deux Plateaux consists of 260 columns of different heights, arranged in a grid. Jacobs used the link between the sculpture and the traditional Damier check used on Louis Vuitton luggage to create a collection based on squares and symmetry, pairs and contrast.</p> <p>The show space was dominated by four shiny escalators, craned into the Louvre courtyard for the occasion. Models appeared in pairs at the top of the escalators, and each walked in step with her twin along the catwalk. The concept showed off the contrast in the collection \u2013 a very short dress beside a floor-length one, a black-on-white graphic print next to its negative image \u2013 but also served as a useful device for obscuring the individuality of the models. Last season, as each model descended from the train in a unique outfit and with a different combination of luggage, the audience was prompted to imagine individual stories. This time, our attention was deftly directed towards the show as a whole.</p> <p>Even the colours \u2013 a chess-set monochrome, leathery brown, the brisk lemon popular on the packaging of cleaning products \u2013 spoke of order and neatness. The apparent liquidity of floor-length metallic sheath dresses was in fact the result of painstakingly precise construction: Vuitton commissioned the smallest sequins ever produced and these were laid on the fabric in regimented rows. Goose feathers embroidered onto evening dresses were laid perfectly flat and trimmed into crisp-edged squares.</p> <p>The use of a grid of squares as the geometric motif of the season was as deliberate as every other aspect of this show. This was the first ever Louis Vuitton show not to feature the LV monogram, as Jacobs pushed the 124-year-old Damier check to the fore. Usually seen in tan and chocolate, it was remade in white and lemon squares for tiny handbags on the catwalk, and will doubtless be much in evidence in first-class cabins next summer. The escalators, perhaps, were to show how well the design suits the backdrop of Heathrow's Terminal 5. But commercial motives notwithstanding, there was a strong synergy between this show, played out on a chequerboard, and the <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/oct/02/sarah-burton-alexander-mcqueen-paris\" title=\"\">honeycomb-based collection by Alexander McQueen the previous day</a>. The growing minimalist movement in Paris is relegating the retro-themed costume meme that has dominated the catwalks for years in favour of fashion with an abstract, mathematical or geometric theme.</p> <p>The first pair of models, with matching beehives in Edie Sedgwick baby-blonde, seemed a nod to Jacobs's 60s-tinged New York show. The pairing of minidresses with maxidresses was inspired by the contrasting 60s beauties Fran\u00e7oise Hardy and Jane Birkin, Jacobs said. \"Hardy was always covered up, Birkin always revealing plenty of flesh, but both always in simple clothes.\" But he was adamant the 60s allusions were secondary to the set, which he designed in collaboration with Buren. \"For me, this show is about purity, about how something simple can be very comforting.\"</p>",

All three highlight the standard and now-familiar attributes of Obama's approach to foreign policy.</p> <p>The Times describes how the Pentagon and CIA are \"laying the groundwork for operations to kill or capture militants implicated in the deadly attack on a diplomatic mission in Libya\", while \"the top-secret Joint Special Operations Command is compiling so-called target packages of detailed information about the suspects.\" That could \"include drone strikes, Special Operations raids like the one that killed Osama bin Laden and joint missions with Libyan authorities.\" The Post adds that \"the White House has held a series of secret meetings in recent months to examine the threat posed by al-Qaida's franchise in North Africa and consider for the first time whether to prepare for unilateral strikes.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, AP - under the headline \"White House Widening Covert War in North Africa\" - describes how, even before the consulate attack, \"small teams of special operations forces arrived at American embassies throughout North Africa\" in order, among other things, to \"set up a network that could quickly strike a terrorist target\". That is because \"the administration has been worried for some time about a growing threat posed by al-Qaida and its offshoots in North Africa.\" The Post similarly reports that this is all being driven by \"concern that al-Qaida's African affiliate has become more dangerous since gaining control of large pockets of territory in Mali and acquiring weapons from post-revolution Libya.\"</p> <p>All of these reports make clear that nothing definitive has yet been ordered by President Obama. But the approach being planned is nonetheless shaped by three of the predominant characteristics of Obama's foreign policy and \"counter-terrorism\" mentality:</p> <p><strong>(1)</strong> Note how all of these processes - including the already established covert presence in North Africa - are all being conducted in total secrecy, away from democratic debate, and without even a suggestion that any Congressional approval is necessary.

As John Glaser <a href=\"http://news.antiwar.com/2012/10/02/us-preparing-for-jsoc-kill-capture-operations-in-libya-after-consulate-attack/\">writes this morning</a>, \"the fact that the President is considering using a top-secret JSOC raid or attack on suspects illustrates the administration's penchant for secrecy, without congressional oversight or open discussion with the public, in its foreign policy operations.\"</p> <p>Obama has expanded drone attacks in Yemen, Somalia, and Pakistan. He has involved the US in aggressive cyber warfare and possibly other forms of military aggression against Iran. He has established and is now looking to expand what AP calls a \"covert war in North Africa\". None of this has been debated, let alone voted on, in Congress. The one time Congress voted on a significant Obama foreign policy - the war in Libya - it voted against its authorization, and Obama blithely ignored that vote and proceeded with the war as though Congressional rejection never happened.</p> <p>In sum, Obama uses military force whenever he wants, wherever he wants, and without anyone's permission. It is worth recalling the <a href=\"http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=lincoln;rgn=div1;view=text;idno=lincoln1;node=lincoln1%3A458\">1848 warning of Abraham Lincoln</a> regarding President James Polk's involvement in the war with Mexico. Lincoln was responding in a letter to his law partner's defense of Polk which argued, as Lincoln put it, that \"if it shall become necessary, to repel invasion, the President may, without violation of the Constitution, cross the line, and invade the teritory of another country; and that whether such necessity exists in any given case, the President is to be the sole judge.\" Replied Lincoln [emphasis in original]:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Allow the President to invade a neighboring nation, whenever <em>he</em> shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion, and you allow him to do so, <em>whenever he may choose to say</em> he deems it necessary for such purpose - and you allow him to make war at pleasure. </p> <p>\"Study to see if you can fix<em> any limit</em> to his power in this respect, after you have given him so much as you propose. If, today, he should choose to say he thinks it necessary to invade Canada, to prevent the British from invading us, how could you stop him? You may say to him, 'I see no probability of the British invading us' but he will say to you 'be silent; I see it, if you don't.'</p> <p>\"The provision of the Constitution giving the war-making power to Congress, was dictated, as I understand it, by the following reasons. Kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars, pretending generally, if not always, that the good of the people was the object. </p> <p>\"This, our Convention understood to be the most oppressive of all Kingly oppressions; and they resolved to so frame the Constitution that no one man should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us. But your view destroys the whole matter, and places our President where kings have always stood.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In the Obama worldview, whether military force will be used in Libya is for the president alone to decide. Aside from being a replica of the <a href=\"http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com/2006/01/ideology-of-lawlessness.html\">Bush/Cheney/Yoo view of executive power and national security</a>, it is a classic example of the power seizure about which Lincoln so stridently warned (and yes, Lincoln himself subsequently seized massive, probably illegal power, though - as I <a href=\"http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com.br/2005/12/idiotic-and-revealing-civil-war.html\">often pointed out to neocons</a> who invoked Lincoln to justify Bush's power abuses - the Civil War was truly an existential threat and not remotely comparable to \"the war on terror\").</p> <p><strong>(2)</strong> President Obama has <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/video/obama-libya-killers-brought-justice-175203021.html\">repeatedly vowed</a> that those responsible for the Benghazi attacks will be \"brought to justice\". That term is Obama-speak for: <em>I will order people summarily executed without a whiff of due process or transparency, based purely on my say-so and my suspicions</em> (just as it <a href=\"http://www.nbcuniversalarchives.com/nbcuni/clip/51A3683_021.do\">was Bush-speak</a> for the same concept). </p> <p>In other words, Obama \"justice\" means summary assassinations ordered in secret without a even a pretense of due process. As Glaser wrote, the reported Libya approach \"demonstrates their preference to kill suspected perpetrators as opposed to apprehending suspects and carrying out a transparent trial in court, something the administration seems long ago to have abandoned in favor of night raids or drone strikes.\" Moreover, just as \"terrorist\" means \"those the US government<em> accuses </em>of being a terrorist,\" the term \"responsible for the Benghazi attack\" means:<em> those whom the president secretly decides is guilty</em>.</p> <p>Trying to apprehend people you think committed crimes and then punishing them once their guilt is proven in a duly constituted judicial tribunal is so obsolete and wimpy: so pre-9/11 and inconsistent with the Age of the Proud Progressive Warrior.</p> <p><strong>(3)</strong> As usual, military intervention is the leading cause of further military intervention. The motives of the Benghazi killers are not definitively known, though it seems likely that they were reacting to some form of American violence in the region, whether it be a drone attack or the Libya intervention. But it does seem clear that what has enabled and empowered them, at least to some degree, is the Libya intervention.</p> <p>Indeed, the Post reports that the administration has become increasingly concerned about the \"al-Qadia affiliate\" in that region since it began \"gaining control of large pockets of territory in Mali and acquiring weapons from post-revolution Libya.\" But there is a <a href=\"http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/mali-besieged-fighters-fleeing-libya\">compelling argument</a> to make that the instability in Libya created by the intervention is precisely what has substantially increased instability in Mali and thus enabled extremists more effectively to use that country as a base of operations. </p> <p>Moreover, critics of the Libya intervention long warned that NATO was arming extremists and even al-Qaida elements and that its doing so would likely lead to future US claims that it has to intervene further to fight the very extremists it itself empowered (just as happened in Afghanistan and so many other places). Combine all that with the fact that any military intervention, even the most noble and successful, creates some degree of resentment and a desire for vengeance against the foreign power, and it seems clear that there is some element of action and reaction to the events in North Africa.</p> <p>In other words, US military action is the prime ingredient ensuring future military actions. It is its own self-sustaining and self-perpetuating form of militarism. Whether that is why the US endlessly exerts military force in other countries, or whether it is a fortunate by-product of that continuous use of force (fortunate from the perspective of the National Security State), Obama's ongoing use of military force in multiple countries ensures that the posture of the US for the foreseeable future will continue to be one of endless war.</p> <h2>Changing White House response</h2> <p>Last week, I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/23/iran-usa\">wrote about</a> the false, self-serving claims initially emanating from the White House about the Benghazi attack, and how much that tracked the process that produced similarly false claims from Obama officials about the bin Laden killing. On Monday, Jon Stewart <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/post/daily-show-satirizes-obamas-libya-comments/2012/10/02/676ddc7e-0c85-11e2-bb5e-492c0d30bff6_blog.html\">mocked the inability of Obama officials</a> to keep their story straight on these attacks, while today, Mother Jones' Adam Serwer <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/10/five-debate-questions-obama-libya\">proposes five questions</a> about Libya which Obama should be asked in tonight's presidential debate.</p>",

Listen to Cuushe here</a></p> <p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Kyoto, Japan.</p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Mayuko Hitotsuyanagi (vocals).</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> Earlier this year we wrote about a Japanese Britpop band called <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/mar/13/new-band-taffy\" title=\"\">Taffy</a>. Now here's a Japanese exponent of that other quintessential indie standby: music at the merging point of shoegaze and ambient, chillout and chillwave. Mayuko Hitotsuyanagi is the anti-Amy/Adele, the diametric opposite of those girls on The X Factor. She doesn't blare, she breathes; she doesn't emote, she simply exhales, and that becomes the vocal on her songs. Her mentor on that talent show or The Voice wouldn't be Jessie J, it would be someone like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/mar/14/new-band-julia-holter\" title=\"\">Julia Holter</a>, someone whose way of expressing the sacred beauty of pop isn't to yell and screech but to whisper and sigh.</p> <p>There is something quite ultimate about Mayuko Hitotsuyanagi and the music she makes as Cuushe. Like Taffy, she's come up with a honed, focused take on her specialist genre, as though she's been studying it for years and has now perfected it. This is perhaps why the responses to it so far have been so over-the-top \u2013 ironic given the calm, still nature of the performances \u2013 from bloggers eager to conjure new ways to capture sepulchral rapture, blown away by the diaphanous dreaminess of it all. Dreaminess and dreams are key to Cuushe. Her new EP is entitled Girl You Know That I Am Here But the Dream and it is a virtual concept record about the dream state and what happens when we sleep. Titles include Do You Know the Way to Sleep, Summer Night Sketch, I Dreamt About Silence, 9125 Days of Sleep Waves and Dust of Dreams. The tracks have been produced and remixed by a variety of artists from the aforementioned Holter, who knows a thing or two about how to communicate the creepy tranquillity of silence, to other favourites of this column such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/sep/16/new-band-teen-daze\" title=\"\">Teen Daze</a>, whose work confirms the profound and far-reaching influence of the 4AD label in general and Cocteau Twins in particular, but also of the succinct snappiness of 80s synthpop.</p> <p>We read somewhere that Cuushe is taking this kind of music to the next level, but she's more, as we say, refining than redefining it. It's not all soft \u2013 or rather, don't be fooled by the softness. There are tones and textures here that, if turned up loud and readjusted in small ways, could prove jarring, reflecting the often disturbed nature of sleep and dreams. At times you might think you are listening to an electronic music act like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHTFmJk7fH0\" title=\"\">m\u00fam</a>, at others to a post-rock outfit like Sigur R\u00f3s. There are more beat-driven tracks featuring loops and samples, and others with glitches and cuts. There are even micro-moments that you could imagine filtering out of a radio station like Rinse FM. But after Cuushe has wrapped everything in that sibilant susurration of hers, it becomes a haunting soundtrack that reminds you of that old Psychic TV album title <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dreams-Less-Sweet-Psychic-TV/dp/B00002482B\" title=\"\">Dreams Less Sweet</a>.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Snuggles in somewhere between Bj\u00f6rk and Sigur R\u00f3s with its ethereal nature and complexity of harmony\" \u2013 Crack in the Road.</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> Cuushe cushions and caresses \u2013 but watch out for the cracks.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Give you nightmares.</p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> Have a sleepover.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> The Girl / You Know That I am Here / But the Dream EP is released by flau in November.</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> Cocteau Twins, Sigur R\u00f3s, Sleep - Over, Slowdive.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://cuushe.net\" title=\"\">cuushe.net</a>.</p> <p><strong>Thursday's new band:</strong> An Blonds.</p>",
  "<p>The Islamist cleric Abu Hamza is suffering from depression and chronic sleep deprivation owing to harsh prison conditions, the high court has been told.</p> <p>The 48-year-old, who was detained in Belmarsh jail in south-east London for eight years, was woken every hour of the night in the high-security unit, his barrister, Alun Jones QC, said.</p> <p>A medical report drawn up in August recorded that he is suffering from type 2 diabetes and has to shower twice a day because of excessive sweating.</p> <p>The court is considering applications from Hamza and four other terrorist suspects who are seeking to extend injunctions preventing their extradition to the US, where they are wanted on al-Qaida-related charges.</p> <p>Hamza is also suffering from memory loss and is unfit to plead at any trial, Jones told the court.</p> <p>\"He has been kept in utterly unacceptable conditions for eight years,\" Jones said. \"His sleep deprivation is primarily because he is woken every hour by prison officers who turn on the light to check on him.\" Belmarsh's high-security unit, he explained, is the \"most restrictive regime in the prison estate\" in the UK.</p> <p>Doctors who examined him have requested that he be given an MRI scan to assess whether he has a degenerative medical condition.</p> <p>But one of the judges hearing the case, Sir John Thomas, said: \"It could be said that the sooner he stands trial, the better for his condition. I don't see how delay can be in the interests of justice.\" Good medical treatment is available in the US, he added.</p> <p>The radical cleric is, additionally, said to feel \"persecuted\" by the press. Jones said Hamza had become a figure of such public notoriety that he had been reduced to the status of \"pantomime villain\".</p> <p>On 21 September, Hamza was moved to Long Lartin prison, where the other suspects fighting deportation are being held. The Home Office is in the final stages of preparations for deporting the five men.</p> <p>Lawyers for two of the other men, Babar Ahmad and Syed Talha Ahsan, condemned the decision by the Crown Prosecution Service not to charge them in the UK as \"irrational\".</p> <p>Phillippa Kaufmann QC, for the two men, questioned the refusal of the director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, to consent to a private prosecution. Ahmad and Ahsan are accused of setting up terrorist fundraising websites. Ahmad has been detained in a British jail for eight years without charge.</p> <p>\"They have both admitted responsibility for involvement in the Azzam website,\" Kauffman said, \"and of possession of the items found during searches of their homes.\"</p> <p>But Thomas commented: \"There's no admission of any offence here. The defendant is trying to dictate where he is prosecuted.\"</p> <p>James Eadie QC, for the British government, said that under the law the home secretary could proceed with their deportation whatever the decision on a private prosecution.</p> <p>The home secretary, Theresa May, has given an undertaking that the five men will not be deported before the court reaches its judgment, expected on Friday.</p>",
  "<p>What does it mean to be a \"feminist\", let alone a \"modern\" one? This long-standing debate received an unlikely answer from Maria Miller, the new women and equalities minister, who believes her status as a very modern feminist is proven by her support for a reduction in the abortion limit from 24 to 20 weeks.</p> <p>I know, I don't really understand it either but given her current position of authority we should at least try to understand what she means.</p> <p>In an astonishing interview with the anti-abortion <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-politics/9578905/Cathy-Newman-how-the-agony-of-my-abortion-made-me-see-both-sides.html\" title=\"\">Daily Telegraph</a>, she repeats her support for reducing the time limit made in a 2008 vote and explains her brand of \"modern feminism\" thus: \"You have got to look at these matters in a very common sense way. I looked at it from the really important stance of the impact on women and children.\"</p> <p>She is \"riven by that very practical impact that late-term abortion has on women\".</p> <p>So Miller was acting out of a sense that as a mother of three with better than average income and intelligence, she has greater ability, or sense, to gauge the impact of having a baby on the woman whose womb he or she inhabits. Call me an old-fashioned feminist but isn't that the real point of accepting the limit for what it is; a date that simply allows women time to make up their own minds about something deeply personal.</p> <p>Your support or otherwise for abortion limits should simply be a matter of personal choice. Friends, colleagues and acquaintances can all agree to differ on term limits, just please don't become \"minister for women\" and act immediately to control the bodies of over half the population.</p> <p>The irony seemingly lost on those who would reduce the limit is that few women choose to wait until they can already feel a child moving inside them to decide on a termination. The vast majority of abortions \u2013 there were 189,931 in England and Wales in 2011 \u2013 happen before 14 weeks' gestation: <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Abortion/Pages/When-should-it-be-done.aspx\" title=\"\">only 2% happen after 20 weeks</a>, and who knows what individual pain, hardship and horror lies behind each one of those decisions. The point is, we don't.</p> <p>Like most of those who have expressed doubts about the current 24-week limit, most forcefully health secretary Jeremy Hunt but also David Cameron, it is \"modern science\" that is used to justify Miller's stance. Babies born before 24 weeks in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_Act_1967\" title=\"\">1967</a> when the abortion bill passed tended not to live.</p> <p>But this is not science that is recognised by the <a href=\"http://www.rcog.org.uk/what-we-do/campaigning-and-opinions/briefings-and-qas-/human-fertilisation-and-embryology-bill/brie-0\" title=\"\">Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists</a>, which two years ago found no scientific evidence to justify a lower limit. I don't know how many of them are feminists but I bet they are responsible for bringing more children into the world than any MP. Which possibly explains why an amendment aimed at stripping the Royal College of its role setting clinical guidelines on abortions was introduced as part of Nadine Dorries amendment plans. Fortunately, like the one designed to stop women being advised on their options, it failed.</p> <p>Supporters of reducing the limit, such as Christina Odone, former editor of the Catholic Herald, suggest in (guess where?) the <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/cristinaodone/100183631/maria-miller-shows-that-changing-the-abortion-law-is-a-feminist-issue/\" title=\"\">Telegraph</a> that it is the \"pro abortion furies\" who are anti-science and anti-feminist, refusing to change the view that a woman's right to choose is sacred.</p> <p>By all means let's have a debate about abortion and science and women's rights but please, please don't muddy the water of what feminism means by positing the idea that those who know best (at least according to their own opinion and belief) speak for each and everyone of us.</p> <p>Even writing that choice has to be at the heart of this debate gives me such a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that I'm immediately placed in one of those old films where the final scene reveals we have been living in flashback all along. Are we doomed to endlessly repeat the same horror until 2015? The big fear, and part of the reason why Miller's interview prompted a twitter storm #mariamillerdoesnotspeakforme, is that Miller and Hunt could together add governmental ballast to MPs such as Nadine Dorries who have so far acted on the fringes of a party that, quite rightly, sees this issue as non-partisan.</p> <p>Let's not allow that to happen.</p>",

To me your songs are anthems that beg for choruses of unity and pose the fundamental question facing the world today \u2013 can man rule himself?</p> <p>In the Venn diagram of American politics, where the circles of crimson and blue overlap, there's a place where you and I meet. It's a place where guys who cling to their religion, rights and guns connect with godless, clinched-fist-tattoo guys [sic].</p> <p>You seem to have a pretty good grasp of comparative US and European politics, but maybe there's a pattern that you're underestimating. Throughout history, leaders have used music to lull young people into a sense of security and euphoria. They've used artists to create the illusion that they can run a country that keeps all the good and wipes out all the bad. Think Zurich 1916. Think artists getting behind guys like Lenin and Trotsky. Think of pop culture's role in the Arab spring. The youth rises up, power structures crumble, and worse leaders are inserted.</p> <p>America, on the other hand, does not rely on leaders \u2013 we rely on the individual. Our country was built on the principles of mercy, justice, and charity \u2013 we ultimately believe that man left alone is good. That is a primary reason I disagree with Chomsky and others that you've touted.</p> <p>American libertarians understand that smaller government gives people freedom \u2013 the freedom to earn or lose, eat or starve, own or sell. The potential for wild success and happiness is tempered by an equal chance of failure. And it is all up to the individual to take control of their destiny.</p> <p>This has been a debate since the founding of America, one that has often gotten confused. Even during the revolution \u2013 a period filled with the greatest minds to ever discuss the idea of freedom \u2013 there were the divisions that continue today. Robespierre or George Washington. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street\" title=\"\">OWS</a> or the Tea Party.</p> <p>Thomas Paine didn't see the difference at first either \u2013 sometimes the difference is too subtle.</p> <p>Yet the question is an easy one: do you believe man can rule himself? Or does he need someone ruling over him to force him to be good and charitable?</p> <p>That is the fundamental divide and everything else follows. Even though faith was important to our American patriots none of them forced Paine to believe. He chose his course and in the end is remembered as a critical patriot in establishing man's first real freedom.</p> <p>They understood that we don't all have to be in the same boat. But rather, focused on the star chart: are you headed toward freedom or despotism?</p> <p>The power that American libertarians like me want to pull down is power that limits the individual's right to roam and create.</p> <p>Matthew, I realise that converts are pretty hard to come by when the stakes are so high and the spotlight so bright, but I thank you for singing words that resonate with man in his struggle to be free.</p> <p>I wish I could leave well enough alone and just be quiet \u2026</p> <p>\u2026 but I've had recurring nightmares that I was loved for who I am and missed the opportunity to be a better man.</p> <p>Good luck on the new record.</p> <p>Glenn\"</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>As the co-founder of the <a href=\"http://www.wlfs.org\">West London Free School</a> (WLFS) \u2013 a four-form entry secondary in Hammersmith \u2013 I've had plenty of arguments about the pros and cons of the coalition's education reforms. After three years, I've concluded that the strongest argument for free schools is that they provide a protected space within the taxpayer-funded sector where teachers and educationalists can try out new things \u2013 the research and development wing of state education, if you like. By allowing schools like the WLFS to innovate and experiment \u2013 and monitoring the results \u2013 we can eventually discover more effective ways of teaching and learning and, by extension, drive up standards across the board.</p> <p>Now, I'm pretty sure I've heard all the responses to this, from \"You shouldn't experiment with children's lives\" to \"There's plenty of innovation going on in community schools already\". Perhaps the best rebuttal is that the population of one free school is too small \u2013 and too atypical \u2013 to draw any meaningful conclusions from a single trial.</p> <p>My intention is not to get into that debate here. Rather, I want to tell you about the experiment that's currently being conducted at the WLFS and which we will shortly extend to a new primary school.</p> <p>The founding principle of the WLFS is that all children can benefit from a classical liberal education, regardless of background or ability. What that means in practice is that all our pupils are expected to study a core of academic subjects \u2013 English language, English literature, maths, history, geography, divinity, Latin, French, physics, chemistry and biology \u00ad\u2013 complemented by plenty of art, music, drama and sport.</p> <p>Our aim is to provide our pupils with a storehouse of core knowledge in a range of traditional subjects \u2013 the best that's been thought and written \u2013 so they end up with the social capital to succeed, both in their schooling and beyond. We hope that pupils will leave the WLFS able to participate in the conversations mankind has been having with itself for thousands of years about the universe and man's place in it. By extension, we also hope they'll exhibit the virtues that are traditionally associated with a classical liberal education: well-informed, honest, courteous, industrious, self-disciplined, self-reliant, resilient, tenacious, public-spirited and open hearted.</p> <p>This is clearly an experiment \u2013 and an ambitious one. We describe the WLFS as \"a grammar school for all\" (Harold Wilson's original definition of a comprehensive), but can all children really access a grammar school curriculum? The conventional wisdom, even in high-performing state schools, is that a classical liberal education is only suitable for children in the top half of the ability spectrum, with less able children (usually those from more deprived backgrounds) being steered towards a combination of academic, technical and vocational subjects. It is that shibboleth, above all others, that the founders of the WLFS have rejected. We believe that, with the right support, it's possible for all children to complete their secondary education with a storehouse of general knowledge \u00ad\u2013 and we draw inspiration from a number of schools that manage this successfully, such as <a href=\"http://www.mossbourne.hackney.sch.uk\">Mossbourne</a> in Hackney and the <a href=\"http://www.renarts.org\">Renaissance Arts Academy</a> in Los Angeles.</p> <p>Obviously, it's far too early to say whether our experiment has been a success. We're only just over a year old. But the early signs are good. To begin with, our 'classical liberal' formula is popular with local parents. The WLFS had nine applicants for every place this year, making us the most oversubscribed state secondary in the borough. Not just white, middle class applicants, either. Approximately 28% of our current year 7s are on free school meals and between 30 and 40% are black, Asian or minority ethnic. Roughly 25% of all the pupils \u2013 year 7s and year 8s \u2013 have special educational needs (SEN) and 50% have English as an additional language.</p> <p>So a fairly typical mix for an inner London comprehensive and, so far, there's no evidence that any of them are struggling with our ethos or curriculum, including those with statements of SEN. (We employ a full-time SEN co-ordinator.) We haven't had to permanently exclude any pupils and in our recent parental satisfaction survey 100% said they'd recommend the school to others. Our year 7 girls netball team came second in the local league \u2013 in spite of playing against girls as old as 14 \u2013 and roughly two-thirds of our first cohort of 120 children are learning a musical instrument. Perhaps most encouragingly, there's no attainment gap between those children on free school meals and their peers. On the contrary, when we assessed our current year 8s at the end of the last academic year we discovered that girls on free school meals are outperforming every other cohort.</p> <p>Next year, we'll be opening another school in Hammersmith \u2013 this time, a two-form entry primary. As with the secondary, we want to offer all the children at the school a classical liberal education. We'll be basing our curriculum on the Core Knowledge Sequence developed for American elementary schools by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._D._Hirsch,_Jr.\">ED Hirsch</a>, the educationalist at the forefront of the 'knowledge' revival. In essence, Hirsch believes there's far too much emphasis on skills in contemporary public education at the expense of detailed subject knowledge, particularly in the humanities. He has repeatedly made the point that trying to teach children higher-order thinking skills without, at the same time, expecting them to memorise a good deal of factual knowledge is not only at odds with our theoretical understanding of how children learn (see <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-Dont-Students-Like-School/dp/047059196X\">Daniel T Willingham, Why Don't Our Students Like School?</a>), but leaves children at taxpayer-funded schools with a 'knowledge deficit' that renders them unable to compete with the products of elite, fee-paying schools.</p> <p>So far, Hirsch's Core Knowledge curriculum has only been rolled out in America, but the results have been spectacular. In the state of Massachusetts, for instance, where Hirsch's curriculum was adopted in 1993, schoolchildren regularly <a href=\"http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_4_hirsch.html\">outperform those of every other state in standardised tests</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.civitas.org.uk\">Civitas</a>, the education thinktank, has adapted Hirsch's elementary school curriculum for English primaries and, in partnership with them, we'll be piloting it at our new primary. Not only will <a href=\"http://coreknowledge.org.uk/sequencetable.php\">this curriculum be knowledge-based</a>, but more and more lessons will be taught by subject specialists as children progress through the school. We're hoping that this approach will be as successful in raising attainment in London as it is in Boston, particularly among children from deprived backgrounds.</p> <p>No doubt many people reading this will have had all their suspicions about free schools confirmed, dismissing them as little more than opportunities for vainglorious publicity seekers to meddle in matters they know nothing about. But if there are any teachers out there who are excited by the idea of getting involved in a bold educational experiment, we'd love to hear from you. We're <a href=\"http://jobs.theguardian.com/job/4520304/primary-headteacher/\">recruiting a primary headteacher and an assistant head and we're looking to appoint by the end of October</a>.</p> <p><em>For more information about the West London Free School and the new primary, email Toby Young on <a href=\"mailto:newfreeschool@gmail.com\">newfreeschool@gmail.com</a></em></p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>At what point will the British public realise that its privacy and freedom is in mortal danger? If the new surveillance commissioner Andrew Rennison <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/new-hd-cctv-puts-human-rights-at-risk-8194844.html\" title=\"\">is right about the development of high-definition and facial-recognition technologies in CCTV systems</a>, it should be today, because these technologies represent an unprecedented threat. They are being allowed to proliferate without any regulation or consideration as to how they will eventually be deployed against the individual.</p> <p>You can pay attention to this issue, or you can let it go. That's what most of us did with the automatic number-plate recognition camera system (ANPR) which was installed on Britain's major road and in town centres to watch in real time and log 90% of vehicle journeys. The decision was taken not by parliament but by the Association of Chief Police Officers \u2013 whose proceedings are secret, because Acpo is&#xa0;a private&#xa0;limited company.</p> <p>It is remarkable this was allowed in a country that prides itself on history of liberty. It is happening again, but with even greater implications for a free society. Rennison, a former police officer who has just been confirmed in the job of surveillance commissioner, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/new-hd-cctv-puts-human-rights-at-risk-8194844.html\" title=\"\">paints a stark picture in the Independent</a>: \"A tiny camera in a dome with 360-degree view can capture your face in the crowd, and there are now the algorithms that run in the background.\" The test data he has seen suggests that cameras will pick out a face in a crowd with a 90% success rate.</p> <p>That means no privacy in the shopping mall, on the train, in children's classrooms and changing rooms, at the match, in the street, in restaurants or pubs. All the cameras currently operating \"for your security\" can be updated and converted to recognise faces. Wherever you go, someone will be logging your movements \u2013 whether it is the police or the big supermarket chains that are anxious to monitor the behaviour of customers in their stores. But the vital fact to remember is that all private CCTV cameras may be accessed by the authorities and are therefore, in effect, part of the state's surveillance system.</p> <p>When campaigning against ID cards I argued that it allowed police and government agencies to know too much about our lives. The ID card would have served as a tracker that logged all our important transactions, which then could have been examined without our knowledge. The point about the ID card was not so much that it allowed us to identify ourselves, which would have been fine, but rather that it gave the state the ability to identify us.</p> <p>There is a world of difference between these two, and it is for this reason that these new surveillance systems represent as great a threat as the ID card. In one sentence: they allow the state and big, secretive corporations to know way too much about us. When people have that kind of power, they always abuse it. If you doubt me, recall that the police national computer system has been used by serving officers for illegal purposes. And consider how a government in a tight situation might be tempted to use a national face-recognition system to keep tabs on people to stifle protest, free expression and assembly.</p> <p>We need a privacy law \u2013 not some vague and well-meaning article in the&#xa0;Human Rights Act, which has never&#xa0;ever guaranteed anyone's privacy (ANPR system is a testament to that), but a bill in parliament that asserts our right to guard&#xa0;our privacy against the state, corporations and the malevolence of future governments. But right now, MPs&#xa0;must&#xa0;have a serious look at the technology, and what is already happening on our streets, because the nightmarish future is already here.</p> <p>As I say you can let this go, or you can make it one of the issues that really matters to parliament. Without privacy there can be no democracy \u2013 we all know that.</p>",
  "<p>Individuals have ideas. The good ones attract followers. The right followers generate a movement. The transition from one to another is not always easy to identify, and harder still to explain.</p> <p>Has the B Corp idea arrived? It's impossible to say for sure, but Andrew Kassoy must be quietly confident. More than 620 companies have signed up. Some, such as the clothing retailer <a href=\"http://www.patagonia.com/eu/enGB/home\" title=\"\">Patagonia</a>, are seriously big players. Even global statesmen are singing B Corp's praises.</p> <p>\"We don't know him or anything\", says Kassoy, in reference to former US president Bill Clinton, who recently waxed lyrical about the B Corp concept during a speech at Oxford University. \"I guess someone must have been talking to him about us.\"</p> <p>The relationship has clearly developed since then because last week Kassoy found himself on stage at the annual meeting of the 2012 Clinton Global Initiative.</p> <h2><strong>New gen capitalism</strong> </h2> <p>So what is B Corp and why is it garnering so much interest? Kassoy, a private equity veteran, describes it as no less than an \"evolution of capitalism\".</p> <p>\"B\" stands for benefit - social and environmental, as well as financial. If 20th century capitalism was obsessed with maximising financial returns, Kassoy insists, then the 21st century will be all about creating social value.</p> <p>\"There's a generation of entrepreneurs and stakeholders who want business to be about more than just money,\" says Kassoy. \"They want business to have some kind of purpose. We like to say that has turned into a global movement of entrepreneurs who are trying to redefine success in business.\"</p> <p>B Corp, or B Corporation to give it its full name, is a response to this sea change. At its most basic, it's a certification scheme. Companies sign up, undergo a self-assessment and have their social and environmental credentials independently verified. If their policies and performance pass muster, they are allowed to join the B Corp club.</p> <p>Kassoy, who came up with the original B Corp idea five years ago with two course mates from Stanford University, accepts that there's already \"an alphabet soup of certifications\" out there. Isn't this just another? He insists not. His, he says, is \"comprehensive\".</p> <p>\"Most certifications are product certifications,\" says Kassoy. \"They tell you a lot about the bar of soap that you're buying or the bag of coffee\u2026 but they don't tell you about the whole company. So big agriculture is increasingly making organic food, but it doesn't tell you that those companies are doing anything useful for the environment or for their employees.\"</p> <p>The B Corp stamp is designed to give consumers and investors alike the ability to cut through the greenwash and identify companies with responsible management across the board. Good companies, not just good products, is Kassoy's message. \"At present, there's no way to tell the difference between a good company and good marketing. People make all sorts of claims, but how is anyone supposed to know?\" Enter the B Corp certified seal of approval.</p> <h2><strong>Certified followers</strong> <br></h2> <p>Companies seem to be buying in (literally, as well as figuratively: membership costs between $500 and $25,000 per year, depending on the company's size). From 13 signatories five years ago, there are now around 620 B Corps. The list ranges from large US brands such as eyewear designer <a href=\"http://www.warbyparker.com/\" title=\"\">Warby Parker</a> and online retailer <a href=\"http://www.etsy.com/\" title=\"\">Etsy.com</a>, through to smaller startups and \"place-based\" businesses.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cascadeng.com/\" title=\"\">Cascade Engineering</a> exemplifies the kind of \"integrated model\" that B Labs - the non-profit that administers the certification \u2013 exists to promote, says Kassoy. Located in western Michigan, \"a tough area, employment-wise\", the firm provides well-paid jobs, while also producing products for the developing world and managing its environmental impact.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cabotcheese.coop/\" title=\"\">Cabot Creamery</a> is another. One of the largest dairy produces in the US, the firm is run on a co-operative basis - one of a growing number of co-ops and employee-owned businesses in the B Corp stable. As a movement, B Corp is predominantly a North American phenomenon. But that's changing. Indeed, the reason Kassoy took to the stage at the Clinton Global Initiative was to announce a partnership with Sistema B in South America. Kassoy hopes to enrol 100 B Corps from the region by next year.</p> <p>They will add to the 29 B Corps that already exist outside the US and Canada. The list includes firms from Kenya, India, Chile and Nicaragua, among others. The idea has yet to catch on in Europe, which will be the focus of B Lab's next big push.</p> <p>Companies sign up for one of three reasons, according to Kassoy. For some, it's leadership. Being part of the B Corp community enables them to \"shout louder\" than they can as lone businesses. For others, it's about \"differentiating themselves\". Kassoy is reluctant to use the word marketing, but that's what it comes down to. Last come the offers. Like the savvy deal-broker it is, B Lab has negotiated concessions on everything from software to business association subscriptions.</p> <h2><strong>Benefit Corp Inc</strong> <br></h2> <p>The story doesn't end there. Certification is the bulk of what B Labs does, but not everything. Kassoy and his fellow founders would like to see B Corps written into the statute book.</p> <p>Right now, US corporate law effectively obliges directors to prioritise shareholder interests above all else. That needs to change, he says. To kick things off, all certified B Corps are required to have their social and environmental commitments written into their governing documents.</p> <p>Again, word is getting out. Eleven US states have now introduced so-called Benefit Corp legislation for B Corp-style companies. As yet, the rules don't generally include incentives such as tax breaks or public sector contracting preferences.</p> <p>Kassoy believes it's only a matter of time before such incentives are introduced. \"Essentially these are businesses that are internalising externalities, so they are creating measurable public benefit \u2026 It [Benefit Corp legislation] is a powerful statement to treat these companies differently because of the benefits they create for society. It's a harbinger of things to come.\"</p> <p>So speaks a man with a good idea to his name. And, who knows, perhaps even a movement.</p> <h2><em>Andrew Kassoy will be speaking at our GSBQ event in New York on Wednesday 10 October.

I thought I'd mention that because, from her <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-politics/9578905/Cathy-Newman-how-the-agony-of-my-abortion-made-me-see-both-sides.html\" title=\"\">interview with the Telegraph</a> published on Tuesday, you might think she was the minister for something else entirely. Minister for specious claims and lack of evidence, maybe. Minister for faux-concern and anti-choice.</p> <p>One of the things that attracted attention when Miller took up her new appointment was her record on abortion: in 2008, she voted to reduce the legal limit on abortion from 24 weeks to 20. Asked by <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/cathy-newman\" title=\"\">Cathy Newman</a> if she'd do the same again, Miller replied: \"Absolutely.\" So the minister charged with representing women's rights in parliament has committed herself to restricting women's control over their own fertility. Let's have a sour little cheer for a woman's right to choose to do whatever she likes once in power, regardless of what might be best for the rest of the gender she supposedly has the portfolio for.</p> <p>This focus on late-term abortion is a misleading way to steer public sentiment against abortion, and when Miller uses it, she's following a path that's been well established by deceitful media practices. But Miller isn't some doctrinaire opponent of abortion. No, Miller is a self-described \"very modern feminist\" who claims to be \"driven by that very practical impact that late-term abortion has on women \u2026 What we are trying to do here is not to put obstacles in people's way but to reflect the way medical science has moved on.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397119302\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349272881962/metro.jpg\" alt=\"metro\" width=\"460\" height=\"541\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Metro illustrates an article on abortion with 'the sentimental image of the obviously pregnant woman'.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How has medical science moved on, then? The Epicure study conducts ongoing research into the care of very premature babies \u2013 those born before 27 weeks' gestation. That has found a significant improvement in survival rates at 24 and 25 weeks, but not for those born at 22 or 23 weeks. A baby born at 22 weeks' gestation has <a href=\"http://www.epicure.ac.uk/overview/overall-outcome/\" title=\"\">a 1% chance of survival</a> from the onset of labour. That can't be the medical science that's persuaded Miller there should be a 20-week limit, then.</p> <p>She says she's worried about the effects on women. Let's have a look at the <a href=\"http://aomrc.org.uk/about-us/news/item/systematic-review-of-induced-abortion-and-women-s-mental-health-published.html\" title=\"\">systematic review of induced abortion and women's mental health, from the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges</a>. That found that \"the rates of mental health problems for women with an unwanted pregnancy are the same, whether they have an abortion or give birth\", which again doesn't seem to cover Miller's \"very practical impact \u2026 on women\" (unless by \"very practical\" she means \"completely invisible\").</p> <p>Abortions at over 20 weeks' gestation accounted for <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;ved=0CD4QFjAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wp.dh.gov.uk%2Ftransparency%2Ffiles%2F2012%2F05%2FCommentary1.pdf&amp;ei=pkxsUOPkHMPR0QXo7YCwDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNElqUAt1DCS0qhDvC0LidfdQFlNcQ&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">1.4% of all terminations in 2010</a>. Miller has won headlines with a position that has no evidence to support it, and that would have a negligible effect on abortion rates overall if adopted in law. Negligible, that is, except for the harm it would cause to the women who need procedures at this stage \u2013 women who may be ending a much-wanted pregnancy because their circumstances have drastically changed, women who may have physical or psychological reasons for failing to acknowledge their pregnancy soon, women who desperately need the safety net of safe, legal, late abortion.</p> <p>For those women, restricting abortion to 20 weeks would be disastrous. But for anti-abortion campaigners, a simplistic and dishonest focus on the fringe cases is useful, because they can identify all abortion with the sentimental image of the obviously pregnant woman. Look at the picture used to illustrate the Telegraph's interview with Miller: the torso of a woman who looks eight months pregnant if she's a day, the bump protectively cradled by her arms. It's a theme repeated again and again, by the Telegraph, the Mail, the Metro and so many outlets that there's a Tumblr to compile them all: the inevitable <a href=\"http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/pregobelly\" title=\"\">pregobelly</a>.</p> <p>If newspapers and websites wanted to give an honest picture of abortion, 90% of stories would be illustrated with pictures of completely flat stomachs. The other 10% would have a picture of a woman's midriff that's just big enough to make you wonder if she's pregnant, but then decide on balance that she might just be getting a bit thick round the middle and it would be rude to mention it.</p> <p>If the media wanted to be really truthful, they could expand the crop to show her face, which would carry an expression of dread or distress at the prospect of maternity. But that would mean treating women as individuals, with individual circumstances, capable of making their own choices in their own best interests. When Miller suggests that she's trying to protect women from the consequences of abortion, what the minister for women and equalities is really saying is that she doesn't trust women.</p>",
  "<p>My friend and colleague of 20 years, Jeremy Pope, who has died aged 73, was one of the pioneers in what is now a global movement to curb corruption and improve integrity in government.</p> <p>Jeremy was born in Wellington, New Zealand, and educated at the Anglican St Peter's Cambridge preparatory school and at Wanganui Collegiate school. He was very involved in all aspects of school life, including cricket and drama, and music, in which he excelled. When moving on to Victoria University, Wellington, it was a toss-up whether he would study music or law. Law won.</p> <p>In 1963 he married Diana Miller (who had said she would marry him only if and when he completed his degree, which he duly did). They were an incredibly close couple, role models for many who knew them. In the 1970s they co-authored a bestselling travel guide to New Zealand which remained continuously in print for more than 20 years.</p> <p>Jeremy's father, who worked for the Chicago Tribune and New York Times, reporting on the Chinese revolution and the Korean and Vietnam wars, triggered his interest in global affairs. As an editor of the New Zealand Law Journal in the 1970s, Jeremy denounced New Zealand's sporting contacts with South Africa. He was responsible for the introduction of the country's duty solicitor scheme.</p> <p>In 1976 he was appointed assistant director of the legal and constitutional affairs division of the Commonwealth secretariat in London, and in 1980 became director of the division. During his time in London he became the only non-African member of Sanroc, the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee, which led campaigns to isolate South Africa in protest against apartheid on the sports field.</p> <p>In 1993, with six others, he co-founded Transparency International (TI), an anti-corruption organisation based in Berlin. From 1993 to 1997, he was its first managing director; he stepped down to head a research and development unit in London from 1997 to 2003. At TI, he was the catalyst for the first open discussions on corruption and governance involving civil society in numerous countries, often in environments of official hostility, for instance in parts of Africa, the Middle East and the former Soviet Union. He inspired hundreds of activists to take up this struggle. He was appointed an anti-corruption adviser to the World Bank president in 1995.</p> <p>In 2003 Jeremy parted ways with TI, and co-founded Tiri, an organisation dedicated to taking the anti-corruption movement in a new direction. We started Tiri without any funding, so we worked from Jeremy and Diana's kitchen for the first two years. This suited Jeremy, who could work in his shorts and T-shirt. In the last four years, after he returned to Wellington, he served on New Zealand's Human Rights Commission, where he was noted for his courage, good humour and gentle wisdom.</p> <p>Jeremy is survived by Diana and their children, Adam, Jemima and Samuel, and grandchildren, Jessica and Miki.</p>",
  "<p>For a few hours on Wednesday, Manchester seemed to come to a standstill to pay tribute to a 23-year-old police officer who was killed along with her colleague as they attended an apparently routine callout last month.</p> <p>Deansgate, one of the city's main thoroughfares, was lined with thousands of officers in dress uniform and members of the public forming a black line, several rows deep, as the cortege made its way to Manchester Cathedral, where the funeral service for Nicola Hughes was held.</p> <p>The crowds outside broke into spontaneous applause as the coffin, shrouded in black cloth, was carried inside to the sound of Pie Jesu. Hughes's parents, Susan and Bryn, and her younger brother, Sam, followed the coffin into the cathedral. The force's flag flew at half-mast overhead. In a building opposite, people stood by red, white and blue flowers spelling out RIP.</p> <p>A large framed portrait of a smiling Hughes was placed next to her coffin, which was topped with white flowers and her police cap and gloves. The Greater Manchester police chaplain, the Rev Charles Nevin, said: \"While we cannot change what has been, we cannot turn back the clock but we can show by our presence in this cathedral, and in the streets, homes and offices of this land, that we stand beside you.\"</p> <p>Among the dignitaries at the service were senior police officers and chief constables from all the UK's police forces, as well as civic leaders and Sir Bobby Charlton.</p> <p>Greater Manchester's chief constable, Sir Peter Fahy, said it was abhorrent that Hughes had met her death in such a way, \"but the best tribute we can make to her memory is that we continue to uphold the standards and the style of policing she demonstrated so well and ensure that might does not conquer over justice\".</p> <p>Hughes was 21 when she joined the force in August 2009, and had impressed the selection panel with her readiness for the job. \"Despite her young years, she was incredibly mature,\" Fahy said.</p> <p>She was initially a neighbourhood officer, then a response officer on C relief at Tameside. She set high standards for herself and impressed everyone with her dedication and cheerfulness, Fahy said. \"She had huge amounts of energy and initiative.\"</p> <p>He said Hughes proved herself to be highly capable in situations of disorder, brave when searching apparently unoccupied premises and going into the unknown, and on the other hand compassionate towards victims of crime. He recounted one occasion when she stopped her police van to rescue a mouse being fought over by two cats and release it into a nearby field.</p> <p>Fahy said she had known full well the risk the job entailed, as her father was a prison officer. He said Hughes and her colleague Fiona Bone had many of the qualities of young police officers and young people who did not have the prejudices and hangups of his generation, and who \"take people as they are, whatever their background\".</p> <p>\"Nicola signed up to the police service knowing that she would put herself in danger. She understood that the unarmed status of British policing is not some tactical option or us holding on to an historic tradition now out of date. She understood it is central to our commitment to the minimum use of force to our relationship with the public and to serving citizens rather than controlling them as some arm of the state,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It is clear from every conversation we have with them that her family were so proud of Nicola. She was a fighter whether engaged in her favourite sport of karate or fighting for justice for a victim of crime. Nevertheless it is her warm smile and her gentleness that stand out from every picture of her. She will be greatly missed by everyone that knew her. We will never forget her great sacrifice.\"</p> <p>Hughes was described as a vibrant young woman who had worked as a waitress at the Bull's Head in Delph and liked keeping fit, looking after her nails and hair, and socialising. She was a green belt in karate and loved singing with headphones on \u2013 and though she thought she could sing, her family never dared to tell her otherwise.</p> <p>Her colleague Sergeant Stephen Miskell said: \"Nicola, with only three years' service, was already greatly respected and loved by her colleagues, who would variously describe her as being friendly, full of life, always willing to give a helping hand, as keen as mustard, as brave as they come and the chatterbox who always kept everybody else awake.\" He said her home-baked chocolate muffins had been a personal favourite.</p> <p>Sergeant Stephen Lovatt read <a href=\"http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/death-is-nothing-at-all/\" title=\"\">Death Is Nothing At All</a>, Inspector Jane Brown read Don't Let Your Hearts Be Troubled, and Sergeant Gordon Swan read <a href=\"http://www.lastingpost.com/pa/pa_readings_db.php?form_mode=poems&amp;page=/index#letterF\" title=\"\">Feel No Guilt In Laughter</a>.</p> <p>The funeral of 32-year-old PC Bone will take place at the cathedral at 10am on Thursday. The constables were killed in Abbey Gardens on the Hattersley estate in Mottram, Tameside, on 18 September after being sent to investigate what seemed to be a routine burglary report.

  "<p>Shareholders have stepped up their campaign to remove Rupert Murdoch as chairman of News Corporation ahead of the media company's annual meeting this month.</p> <p>Hermes, a British fund manager that controls \u00a324.8bn assets, joined an action on Wednesday launched by dissident shareholders seeking to oust News Corp's chairman in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal.</p> <p>Glass Lewis, one of the largest shareholder advisory groups, has also recommended its clients vote for the appointment of an independent chair. This is the second year that major shareholders have rounded on Murdoch and his board.</p> <p>Hans Hirt, global head of corporate engagement at Hermes, said: \"While we acknowledge the recent board changes made by the company, News Corp has still not sufficiently addressed the significant shareholder concerns about its board structure and corporate culture highlighted at last year's annual meeting. The time is right for the company to appoint an independent chair in order to rebuild trust, and ensure that the interests of all investors are more properly represented.\"</p> <p>The resolution was co-filed by Christian Brothers Investment Services (CBIS) and members of the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF). It will be voted on at the company's annual meeting in Los Angeles on 16 October.</p> <p>A similar vote last year failed to pass. Murdoch and his family own about 12% of the media giant but control 40% of the vote because of News Corp's dual class share structure. Last year, the majority of independent voters voted against much of News Corp's board including Murdoch's sons Lachlan and James.</p> <p>This year's meeting comes amid rumours that News Corp is considering appointing James Murdoch to head Fox Networks, the division that runs the firm's flagship Fox channel. Such a move would come in a year that has seen James Murdoch criticised for his handling of the hacking revelations and resign as chairman of both News International, the company's British newspaper division, and BSkyB, the British satellite broadcaster that it controls.</p> <p>Julie Tanner, director of socially responsible investing at CBIS, called the speculation a \"slap in the face for shareholders, not to mention victims of the hacking scandal\".</p>",
  "<p><strong>Do we, as opposed to authors, publishers and TV celebrities, need any more cookbooks? Are there any really new recipes out there?</strong></p> <p>Ninety-nine per cent of cookbooks and accompanying TV programmes are not about cooks at all. They are about chefs. A new word should be used to describe them: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/28/lets-start-foodie-backlash\" title=\"chefbooks\">chefbooks</a>. A cook is someone who, with no training, has to feed themselves and a family three times a day, often on a tight budget.

From this we can infer that it loses more water to evaporation than it gains from rainfall and river discharge. So one would expect that it would shrink if it was cut off from the Atlantic.

It's possible that it might then reach an equilibrium at a size smaller than present where the evaporation was equal to the rainfall and river flow.</p> <p>In recent years we've seen the Aral Sea shrink when much of the river flow into that sea was diverted for agriculture.

  "<p>A complaint to the European Commission that the supreme court's decision in <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2010_0170_Judgment.pdf\" title=\"\">Jivraj v Hashwani</a> breaches European laws against discrimination may have major implications for equality and religious freedom.</p> <p>In 1981, two businessmen from the Ismaili Muslim community, Hashwani and Jivraj signed a contract relating to a joint business venture and included a clause referring disputes to arbitrators who were required to be members of the Ismaili community. Now, 30 years later, this arbitration clause has been considered at every level of the English court system, anda referral to the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/eu_law/your_rights/your_rights_en.htm\" title=\"\">European court of justice (ECJ)</a> has been requested.</p> <p>Arbitration has a long history and today is more popular than ever. From multinational corporations to sole traders, businesses arbitrate so that they can choose who will decide their disputes, and avoid the time and cost of court proceedings.</p> <p>After a lengthy dispute between Hashwani and Jivraj about tax issues, the Ismaili arbitrator adjudicating it resigned. Hashwani failed to find a qualified Ismaili replacement and appointed retired judge Sir Anthony Coleman as arbitrator. Jivraj objected on the basis that Coleman is not a member of the Ismaili community and his appointment breached the arbitration clause. Hashwani responded that the clause is unenforceable under European legislation and the Equality Act 2010 because it unfairly discriminates against non-Ismaili arbitrators.</p> <p>In 2011, the supreme court held, in favour of Jivraj, that arbitrators are not protected by equality legislation, and, even if they are, the requirement for an arbitrator from the Ismaili community was a \"genuine occupational requirement\". Following the supreme court's decision, a new arbitrator from the Ismaili community was appointed. However, when this arbitrator resignedHashwani asked the European Commission to refer the case to ECJ.</p> <p>An ECJ decision could be far reaching. The \"genuine occupational requirement\" depends on whether it is genuinely necessary for the arbitrator to be from the Ismaili community to decide the dispute. The supreme court thought it was, but Hashwani says the issues in dispute simply require a suitably qualified lawyer, of any religion, and that his problems finding an arbitrator from the Ismaili community reinforce this. His lawyer, Sarosh Zaiwalla, says: \"This is a commercial dispute which in reality only required an experienced lawyer \u2013 there was no question of religion. Hashwani was forced to seek to appoint a non-Ismaili arbitrator because, after 20 years of legal proceedings, that was the only way he could get justice\".</p> <p>The supreme court commented that a decision by a religious organisation only to employ a lawyer of its own religion was unlikely to be permitted under the Equality Act. It is only a short further step to say that discrimination by private parties appointing arbitrators should not be permitted either. A decision by the ECJ to this effect would be the final nail in the coffin for religious arbitration.</p> <p>In finding that arbitrators are not protected by equality legislation the supreme court, in the second limb of its decision, distinguished between employment and self-employment and restricted the extent to which equality legislation protects the self-employed. The ECJ may well disagree. Should arbitrators, or indeed doctors, plumbers or anyone else who is self-employed, be protected from discrimination? Or, to reverse the question, should a person who privately instructs a solicitor, a dentist, or an electrician, have their personal choice subject to the full gamut of equality legislation?</p> <p>Supporters of the supreme court say that parties should have the freedom to choose their arbitrator taking into account their religious beliefs and that the judgment safeguards the flexibility and neutrality of arbitration. Hashwani, however, argues this is tantamount to an employer saying \"no blacks, Christians or gays\". Sir Richard Buxton, a retired judge who heard the case in the court of appeal, said the decision is a licence for parties to agree not to appoint \"a woman, a Jew, or a homosexual\".</p> <p>The case involves the balancing of two conflicting principles of human rights: equality and the elimination of discrimination on the one hand, versus religious and personal freedom on the other.</p>",
  "<p>It was an idea that first emerged at the end of the heyday of cyber-utopianism: <a href=\"http://bitcoin.org/\" title=\"\">Bitcoin</a>, the virtual and universal currency that could be exchanged for goods and services online, the brainchild of a mysterious pseudonymous cryptographer.</p> <p>Since its formal launch in 2009, Bitcoin has been adopted by a variety of organisations, including WikiLeaks, the Electronic Frontier Freedom Foundation (albeit briefly) and a number of online traders.</p> <p>But others, too, saw its unique advantages \u2013 including criminals who have allegedly used it for money-laundering. More recently a Bitcoin savings and loan bank came under investigation for being a fraudulent Ponzi scheme.</p> <p>Now, following these controversies, some of its leading supporters have launched a foundation designed to rehabilitate the reputation of the fledging online \"currency\".</p> <p><a href=\"https://bitcoinfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">The Bitcoin Foundation</a> is modelled on the Linux Foundation, the non-profit group that promotes the popular open source operating system. Its purpose is clear: to attempt to restore faith in a system bedevilled by a reputation for fraud and criminality.</p> <p>The most recent episode saw thieves with a Russian IP address raid <a href=\"https://bitfloor.com/\" title=\"\">Bitfloor</a> \u2013 a US online trading floor for the currency, stealing $250,000-worth of Bitcoins.</p> <p>First proposed by an online cryptographer who styled himself \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" \u2013 a real identity has never been established \u2013 it was initially adopted by a small group of cyber-utopians, including Gavin Andresen, a US computer code-writer and one of the figures behind the new foundation.</p> <p>While individual units of the currency are minted \u2013 or \"mined\" in Bitcoin's terminology \u2013 by a complex system, most of those who use Bitcoins purchase them by exchanging them for conventional currency.</p> <p>However, fraudsters have developed systems for quickly \"minting\" currency that have undermined it while other criminal enterprises have been quick to see the advantages of the system. In 2011, the US Senate called for Bitcoin to be investigated for its links to tax evasion and money-laundering.</p> <p>A statement from the foundation last week explained the problems Bitcoin had encountered, and how it would attempt to solve them. It said: \"As the Bitcoin economy has evolved, we have all noticed barriers to its widespread adoption \u2013 [programmes] that attempt to undermine the network, hackers that threaten wallets, and an undeserved reputation stirred by ignorance and inaccurate reporting.</p> <p>\"There's a lot to love [but] \u2026 there are botnet operators, hackers, and Ponzi-scheme runners floating around our space,\" explained the company's chairman, Peter Vessenes.</p> <p>He also alluded to the fact that some governments are far from delighted with the prospect of an online alternative to state-issued currencies. \"We occasionally hear threatening statements from government representatives that don't seem to understand the law, much less how great Bitcoins are for the world.</p> <p>\u2026 There are legal questions to be answered about Bitcoins, different ones in different jurisdictions.\"</p> <p>Perhaps inevitably, given its online context, the currency also fuelled a speculative bubble and subsequent collapse, seeing its value after launch peak at nearly $30 in June 2011 before crashing to $2 late last year.</p> <p>So given the problems, why would anyone want Bitcoins? One answer was supplied in a <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21563752\" title=\"\">recent article on the currency in the Economist</a> that described transactions on a shady website known as Silk Road \u2013 a \"sort of eBay for drugs hidden in a dark corner of the web\" \u2013 which saw, according to the magazine's best estimate, Bitcoin transactions to the value of almost $2m (\u00a31.24m) a month.</p>",
  "<p>This statement covers all our significant findings regarding issues covered in the Operations section of the Living Our Values report to date. As we are using a rolling assurance process alongside the rolling publication of sections in the report, we may add additional findings that come to light as we investigate each section. All significant claims made and the data covering energy, carbon, waste recycling and paper sourcing in this section have been assured.</p> <p>The Guardian has made further progress towards the goal of reporting comprehensive data that reflects the significant environmental impacts of the business. We previously highlighted the lack of data about the impacts of digital publication \u2013 an area that many media organisations continue to ignore. </p> <p>So it is particularly pleasing to see the Sympact project start to bear fruit with the publication of an estimated carbon footprint for the theguardian.com website. This is a difficult area to tackle and the Guardian deserves credit for generating some tangible numbers, albeit estimates at this stage, and for appointing a board-level champion with responsibility for digital sustainability. </p> <p>Ultimately, the goal should be to understand and quantify digital impacts to at least the same level as the Guardian currently achieves for its paper publications and then to set meaningful improvement targets. There is still a long way to go to get to this point and the Guardian should maintain its drive for digital sustainability, reflecting the direction that the business is taking.</p> <p>The availability of the Sympact data has allowed the Guardian to widen further the scope of its carbon footprint reporting and this is to be applauded. GNM should now consider presenting its carbon footprint data using the \"Scopes\" defined by the international GHG Protocol Initiative. </p> <p>This template has been widely adopted by other reporting organisations and is increasingly being used to frame legislation (for example the draft regulations that will require reporting of GHG emissions by UK quoted companies). This will help clarify the boundaries of the footprint and facilitate comparison, both with previous years' data reported by the Guardian and with data reported by other organisations.</p> <p>Last year, we commented on the lack of print site waste management data and so it is good to see some reported this year. At present it is not possible to give a comprehensive breakdown by waste category for each site, which would help to improve clarity of reporting for next year.</p> <p>Collecting data is not an end in itself, but a means of measuring performance. Once again the Guardian is able to demonstrate performance improvements in energy use, water consumption and waste recycling in the areas where there is direct management control. This is a reflection of the continuing efforts of staff at the editorial offices and print sites to implement improvement initiatives day-to-day.</p> <p>Managing impacts in the supply chain, where there is less direct control, is more difficult and the increase in emissions associated with business travel is an example of this. The efforts of the procurement team to integrate sustainability into purchasing contracts should help to address this issue, building on the Guardian's excellent track record of measuring and improving the sustainability of its paper supplies.</p>",
  "<p>Isn't it interesting how people queue to buy the latest IT gizmo \u2013 especially if that gizmo is perceived or promoted to be part of new \"best practice\" standards. I believe that much damage has been done to social housing operations and budgets over the past decade by organisations including the (now thankfully defunct) Audit Commission and the Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) promoting dysfunctional IT systems.</p> <p>I would like to share my thoughts about 'personal digital assistants', or PDAs. The CIH repairs charter recommends IT products such as these as the answer to the challenges of workfoce management. These devices typically cost housing providers more than \u00a3200,000 per year.</p> <p>PDAs are a major part of an organisational problem, not part of a solution. Procurement best practice endorses and sustains the use of these pointless and costly devices. The use of PDAs in the large social housing providers I have worked with has been shown to cause serious financial loss to the client while providing profits for contractors. In one case alone, a housing association faced a loss of \u00a32m a year directly ascribable to the use of PDAs.</p> <p>The argument in favour of IT claims that PDAs will allow senior management in an organisation to understand in detail what is happening in their repairs and maintenance services. Costs will be under control, and visible to those responsible for managing them.</p> <p>This is nonsense. In my experience, they do nothing of the sort. The everyday use of these devices in housing associations across the UK goes something like this:</p> <p>\u2022 A responsive repairs request comes in to an organisation's call centre.</p> <p>\u2022 The job is assessed by someone who doesn't understand how all the elements of a building work and given a schedule of rates (SoR) code using repairs fault diagnosis software. An appointment is forced on a tenant, the timing of which meets the needs of the housing provider's \"dynamic scheduling software\" \u2013 not the tenant.</p> <p>\u2022 The job is sent to a tradesperson's PDA, with a time slot for the work based on what the software thinks the problem is \u2013 not the analysis of skilled repairs staff.</p> <p>\u2022 Often the work cannot be done in that time slot, because it is more complicated than expected or the member of staff does not have the necessary materials. The worker has to tell the tenant to re-book the job.</p> <p>\u2022 The PDA just keeps filling up with more jobs, despite complications or urgencies encountered at the jobs already attended.</p> <p>\u2022 If there are other repairs that need done at a property, the member of staff is not allowed to complete them \u2013 however simple \u2013 because it's not registered on the PDA. This means that contractors are paid extra, as they have to return to a property unnecessarily.</p> <p>\u2022 The job is charged to the contractor client on the basis of a meaningless code, and not the actual work that has been carried out.</p> <p>\u2022 The senior leaders' management information system for the housing association repairs service looks great. In reality, it is full of inaccurate nonsense.</p> <p>Stoke city council has just won a Tenant Participation Advisory Service national award for good customer experience in its repairs service. One of the reasons they won the award was because the council insisted that PDAs were no longer used to carry out this work. You can <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/46937703\" title=\"\">listen to staff from Stoke council</a> talking openly about the damage to its repairs performance caused specifically by the use of this apparently revolutionary IT.

  "<p>The procurement department at GNM was formed in July 2010 to deliver a strategic sourcing approach, and the last financial year was spent developing policies and procedures. </p> <p>A significant step to embedding sustainable thinking into procurement was the board-approved mandate, of which sustainability is key thread. This requires the majority of our supplier spend to be strategically reviewed by the central procurement team. </p> <p>By having a centralised department overseeing purchasing, GNM can ensure it generates real value for the business, society and the planet.</p> <p>Paper procurement for our newspapers and magazines is our single largest third-party spend and highly significant from a sustainability risk perspective. We have in place a comprehensive sustainable paper-sourcing policy, and we work very closely with our suppliers to monitor sustainability performance. </p> <p>This is achieved through the collection of real-time data that allows GNM to see on a monthly basis how much paper we are buying, the percentages of recycled and virgin fibre being used, certification levels, and also carbon intensities. </p> <p>For more details on our performance against our paper key performance indicators please visit the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainability/sustainability-report-2012-operations-paper\">paper section</a>.</p> <p>We are now beginning to pay more attention to the managing and reporting of the sustainability credentials of our key suppliers in the digital field.</p> <p>This is already proving to be challenging for a number of reasons. One is that it is difficult to get quality information from suppliers about the environmental footprint and social justice aspects of the digital products and services they sell.</p> <p>Beyond this, we lack in digital what we have in paper purchasing: a single expert who understands the newsprint market inside out. Also, the world of digital is more diverse and complex and therefore harder to understand.<br>This is a problem shared by most companies, and GNM has been able to make progress thanks to the innovative digital footprint research we have been supporting.</p> <p>Nevertheless, this difficulty in relating to digital impacts still makes it difficult to fully engage senior managers in discussions, especially during periods of structural change.</p> <p>Where we need to make improvements is in creating a clear framework and language to allow the organisation to systematically consider risks and opportunities when making decisions.</p> <p>We also need to clarify the boundaries of our responsibility. Is it the computer hardware makers, the networks, or the consumer who logs on to our website?</p> <p>If the answer is \"all of the above\", we need to understand better how to account for these and separate them out in a meaningful way.</p> <h2>Internal training</h2> <p>To increase our knowledge of sustainable procurement in general, a number of workshops were held for staff.</p> <p>Working with the internal procurement team, the focus was on looking at how sustainable thinking could identify broader and more complex risks and opportunities that may affect costs over the length of the contract. </p> <p>Examples from a range of organisations was used to show how sustainable procurement provides business resilience through better control, awareness and traceability throughout the value chain. </p> <p>The Guardian Offers/Revenue team, which sells products ranging from travel to books, have been keen to develop a sustainability policy for their customers and suppliers as part of their commitment to openness and transparency. </p> <p>Workshops for this department focused on helping them to identify key risks within their supply chain that should be controlled through a sustainability policy and appropriate due diligence. The <a href=\"http://www.guardiancottages.co.uk/sites/cottageselection/partners/gdn/pages//popups/GHOSustainablePolicy.pdf\">travel policy</a> is now live. </p> <h2>Tendering and contracts</h2> <p>GNM does not have the budgets or buying power of a large multinational company, so we must use the contracting and post-contracting stage of the process to influence service delivery and sustainability.</p> <p>We recognise that smaller suppliers can find it difficult to provide relevant information, so we are looking to develop flexibility in the sustainability questions we ask to avoid bidders being put off. The questions are being developed around how our demands for services and products drive emissions, consumption and ethical working practices. </p> <p>Our tendering templates are flexible, consisting of a core template that is agreed and then modified to fit the needs of the business, the specific risks associated with the purchase and maximising value from the suppliers.</p> <p>Also, more specific questions have been developed regarding what the supplier will do to help reduce our impacts and meet targets, rather than whether they simply have a CSR policy or not. </p> <p>Even though GNM is going through a period of radical change, we remain dedicated to developing sustainable supply chains. To help ensure this, the sustainability team advises the procurement department during each tender process. </p> <p>In the past, the procurement department ensured that sustainability was integrated into purchasing, but we found that a core weakness was that individual departments often did not follow up and ensure that our suppliers met their original commitments.</p> <p>To ensure this does not continue, we have put specific targets into contracts. In some cases, this means implementing sustainability goals at the outset where perhaps previously they did not exist. </p> <p>An excellent example of this in action was the 2011 tender for the consolidation of travel services. GNM's sustainability department was involved from the outset, identifying the appropriate sustainability areas for potential suppliers to cover during the tender drafting. </p> <p>Shortlisted suppliers were asked to demonstrate how they would support GNM in reducing travel emissions as well as costs. The responses were assessed by GNM's environmental and sustainability manager Christopher Hodgson, who also attended the tender interviews.</p> <p>The winning contractor was asked to: <br></p> <ul> <li>Provide appropriate data to enable GNM to calculate and monitor its full carbon and environmental footprint</li> <li>Provide analysis of this data to understand patterns, identify irregularities and suggest opportunities for improvements</li> <li>Assist the setting and delivering of travel sustainability targets that support and align with GNM sustainability objectives and targets</li> <li>Propose a mechanism for travellers and travel bookers to determine or identify the true cost of travel decision and alternatives</li> <li>Encourage travel bookers to book a sustainable travel option and identify opportunities to reduce travel</li> </ul> <p>Progress on actually delivering on these goals has so far been mixed. While we now have full carbon reporting for our travel, the more innovative elements have not yet been addressed and will require more focus from GNM.</p>",
  "<p>In the last financial year, effort was put into minimising waste and reducing our carbon footprint. This year, this section of the report focuses on our head office in King's Cross, London. However, carbon emissions include both our Manchester office and our newly opened New York Office. </p> <h2>Carbon Footprint</h2> <p>Office-based carbon emissions (including our data centre) fell by 7% or 270tCO2e in the last financial year, despite the fact that we opened a new office in New York. Our London headquarters at King's Place saw both gas and electricity consumption fall, resulting in emissions per member of staff falling by 9% to 2.3tCO2e. </p> <p>Other improvements included fitting stand-alone air-conditioning units for our archive centre so that the main building chillers do not run out of office hours. The cost of the installation will be recouped in a matter of months through available energy savings.</p> <h2>Waste Footprint</h2> <p>A campaign called Love Your Waste was launched last year across Guardian News &amp; Media, resulting in an increase in recycling rates, including composting, from 66% to 78%. All waste is managed according to current legislation, and, even though we do recycle WEEE (ie computers, mobiles), batteries, toner cartridges and CDs, this data was not available for inclusion in the waste figures. </p> <p>Beyond improving signage and bins, we wanted to impress on staff that what we throw away has a value beyond its current life.</p> <p>In order to maintain progress and stop staff slipping back into old behaviours, we now collect data from our cleaning team for each floor so that we can target individual departments. </p> <h2>Resource Footprint</h2> <p>We develop plans based on two key factors \u2013 impact as well as visibility. This means that even, though some issues are not significant in terms of reducing our overall footprint, they are perceived to be important to employees and so need to be addressed.</p> <p>One example was concern among staff over our use of hundreds of thousands of paper cups for water. As a result, these have now been replaced by china mugs. To align this sort of sustainable action with the business, the new mugs where branded with the \"3 Little Pigs\" as part of our Whole Picture brand campaign. This will save more than \u00a310,000 and 472,000 paper cups a year, equivalent to 1.5% of our overall waste.</p> <p>We have also improved our photocopier paper by moving to a 100% recycled product. However, paper consumption for our printer paper rose by nearly a third in the last financial year. Further research is required understand why this is happening and identify ways to reduce it. </p> <h2>New York</h2> <p>In 2011 December, a new office was set up in New York for about 45 staff. The refurbishment was carried out by local contractors, and where possible we have mirrored the same working practices as our London office for recycling, lighting and energy usage. The office is in a multi-tenanted building and we share ideas on best practice with the landlords.</p>",
  "<p>While digital is becoming an increasing proportion of Guardian News &amp; Media's (GNM) business, our use of newsprint continues to have a significant environmental impact. </p> <p>One of the central aims of the paper purchaser over the past few years has been to raise the percentage of newsprint and magazine paper coming from sustainable sources either recycled or certified (ie FSC or PEFC) virgin fibre. </p> <p>The last financial year saw another step forward, with sustainably sourced paper for GNM newsprint rising to 98% from 96% last year, while magazine paper rose from 87% to 94%. </p> <p>When purchasing paper, we aim to balance price, quality, security of delivery, carbon emissions and sustainable paper sourcing. This means taking buying decisions that optimise the mix of sustainability characteristics for each paper grade. Individual purchasing decisions will, from time to time, involve trade-offs where an improvement in one area can be achieved only at the expense of another. </p> <p>In the last financial year we increased the proportion of paper purchased from a British mill that produced excellent recycled product, at lower cost and reduced distribution miles, but the trade-off was lower energy efficiency. </p> <p>While this decision increased overall carbon emissions, we maintained our paper emission target of 370kg per tonne and recycling target of 80%. </p> <p>Reduced sales and pagination, as well as a lower weight of paper, meant that GNM saw a 13% reduction in newsprint and magazine paper consumption in 2011-12 to 56,210 tonnes. However, we have maintained our commitment to the sustainable paper policy and indicators, and this is how we performed in the financial year 2011-12: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397113946\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/17/1347873313275/LOV2012_Ops_Paper-001.png\" alt=\"LOV2012_Ops_Paper\" width=\"460\" height=\"690\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">GUARDIAN GRAPHICS</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Use of recycled paper</h2> <p>We met our recycled newsprint target of a minimum of 80%, although the figure fell slightly from 86% to 82%. This fall was due to a greater proportion of GNM's newsprint coming from certified virgin paper in Norway.</p> <h2>Use of virgin paper from certified source</h2> <p>The overall level of certified virgin fibre rose to 92% for GNM products against 82% the previous financial year. This was a result of switching from some North American to Scandinavian mills that use more certified virgin fibre and also have a lower carbon intensity. The certified virgin fibre target is 90% by the end of 2013.</p> <h2>Kilograms of carbon per tonne of paper</h2> <p>While one of the indicators in our paper purchasing policy is to reduce the carbon intensity of the paper we purchase, a decision to shift some purchasing to the Palm recycled paper mill located in the UK, resulted in our paper-related carbon emissions rising by 1260tCO2e or 7% in 2011-12 compared with the previous year. Nevertheless, we continued to meet our target of maintaining emissions below 370kgCO2e per tonne of paper purchased.</p> <p>The energy use of the Palm mill is one of the highest across our supply base, even though it is one of the newest mills in Europe. It does, however, make high-quality newsprint. </p> <p>We have been raising the issue of the high power consumption and associated CO2 emissions with the supplier and asking for future projections.</p> <p>Palm has responded by saying it is planning to change to a more renewable energy supply. We have been advised that it will be purchasing steam from an incinerator plant in the near future, which will reduce the grid electricity purchased.</p> <h2>Chain of custody</h2> <p>We also achieved PEFC certification for paper supplies for Guardian Weekend and the Observer magazines. Details of certification can be found at PEFC.</p> <p>This means we have a paper trail and a management system in place that tracks the fibre supplies for the paper from sustainably managed forests through to the printed product. To ensure you, the reader, know that the magazines contain only certified virgin material, Guardian Weekend and the Observer magazine carry the PEFC logo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397113947\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348582994239/PEFC-PRO-4.jpg\" alt=\"PEFC logo\" width=\"150\" height=\"242\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Reducing paper resource and cost</h2> <p>While not a specific policy KPI, but given that newsprint accounts for a large part of GNM's overall costs, the company decided to further reduce the grammage of the magazine paper for Guardian Weekend (65gsm to 60gsm, November 2011) and Observer Magazine (60gsm to 56gsm, October 2011). This has achieved a reduction of 7% in the tonnage of paper purchased.&#xa0;</p> <h2>The paper policy</h2> <p>GNM continues to set and assess our paper-purchasing policy, KPIs and performance through the paper purchasing committee. The committee continued to meet during the year to track our procedures against legislation and policy developments.</p> <p>This included the forthcoming EU Illegal Timber Regulation, which will come into force in March 2013 and the WRI and WBCSD update to Sustainable Procurement of Wood and Paper-based Products (July 2011).</p> <p>As a result, we have decided to take action to strengthen information from suppliers about uncertified virgin fibre and non-fibre additives or fillers, such as clay and minerals. We will also take steps to investigate the water footprint of our paper supplies.</p> <p>We will shortly publish an updated paper policy and new KPIs to run up to 2015, focusing on the areas of: </p> <ul> <li>The sustainability of the fibre that comprises the main ingredient of paper</li> <li>The consumption of energy and emissions of greenhouse gases</li> <li>The conservation of water resources</li> <li>Pollution control</li> <li>The sustainability of other paper additives</li> </ul> <br>A copy of the current GMG/GNM paper-purchasing policy is available <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainability/carbon-footprint-paper-purchasing-policy?INTCMP=SRCH\">here</a>.",
  "<p>At the heart of our operations are our two fully-operated Guardian print centres (GPCs) in Manchester and Stratford, east London, which print the Guardian and Observer newspapers and undertake some third-party contract printing. All our magazines are printed by our contractor, Polestar. </p> <p>Both GPC sites have been engaged in our corporate sustainability drive for many years, and further improvements now are all about efficiency gains and maximising revenues through effective management systems.</p> <p>As a result of a systematic approach to monitoring, planning, testing and implementation, both GPCs in the past financial year ending March 2012, improved energy, water and waste efficiency</p> <h2>Carbon Footprint</h2> <p>Total emissions fell by 9% or 536tCO2e across the print sites, which follows a 10% reduction the previous year. The combined emissions, for both sites, per tonne of newsprint used fell to 116kgCO2 equivalent in 2011-12 compared with 122kgCO2 equivalent. <br> Continuing falls in newspaper circulation means it is becoming harder to reduce emissions because of fixed energy requirements such as lighting, heating and water treatment. </p> <p>The print sites have, therefore, done an outstanding job to achieve a year-on-year base load emissions reduction across across both GPCs. Base load is the consumption of electricity that occurs regardless of how or what we print. Therefore, it is a true reflection of improvement that removes the effect of differences in print runs. For example, you can simply improve efficiency by just printing more on a run. </p> <p>We are looking to develop better metrics to measure efficiency and this is likely to include per page emissions as well as the energy base load. </p> <p>Our contract printer, Polestar, has also made strong progress, reducing the carbon associated with our magazines, including Guardian Weekend, The Guide, Observer Magazine and Observer Food Monthly by 7% or 178tCO2. </p> <p>We have continued to monitor our distribution carbon footprint, which includes distribution from our GPC and Polestar print sites to our wholesalers. What we don't yet include are the emissions associated with distributing from wholesaler to retailer. </p> <p>Carbon per mile travelled has remained very constant, although there was a very small decrease in the amount of carbon dioxide per mile compared with the previous year (from 0.875 to 0.863 kg/mile). </p> <p>However, we have seen a 3.29% increase in mileage within the distribution contract. This has driven carbon emissions up by 2%. </p> <p>We are looking at alternative measures that more closely reflect our environmental impact and will develop KPIs with our new distribution partners when the contracts change and we engage&#xa0;our new suppliers in 2012. </p> <p>As these new arrangements kick in, we will also be sharing distribution with other newspaper titles where possible, and&#xa0;this will help reduce our carbon footprint.</p> <p>Smart metering and building management system:</p> <p>Manchester and London GPCs installed smart metering for both electricity and water, and work has continued to closely control the air that is re-circulated within the building, which negates the need to reheat or cool the air from fresh. Proposals are also being drawn up to optimise heating at the print sites. </p> <p>Lighting improvements at GPC London:</p> <p>During the current financial year, we will be rolling out a new lighting plan for the production areas, which involves all lights dimming to 10% power when the area is unoccupied.</p> <p>This system will lead to significant savings given both print sites are industrial in scale and run 24 hours a day. The initial outlay will be recouped within two years, showing a significant saving after that, and there is likely to be a carbon reduction of about 500 tonnes a year.</p> <p>LED lights are also being tested in the despatch yard, which could replace the existing flood lights. </p> <h2>Resource Footprint</h2> <p>The GPCs reduced water usage by 15.8%, or 1,536,000 litres, across both sites in the last financial year. This is equivalent to the daily water use of 12,000 average UK citizens and follows a reduction of 14% in 2010-11. </p> <p>Our Manchester print site, in particular, made great strides by reducing its need for water by 32%, or 1,218,000 litres. This was mainly due to improved controls, water recycling, cleaning processes and observation of water use to detect and fix leaks. </p> <p>Ink consumption across both presses has also reduced this year by 14%, or 169,905kg. This reduction was due to efficiency measures and reduced printing. For example, in Manchester, grams of black ink per page fell from 0.0268g to 0.0250g or 7%. </p> <p>Water reduction initiatives:</p> <p>Sensors were placed in all urinals and two changes were made to ink and damp levels on the press at the Manchester site. Unfortunately, we have no specific data on how much the first improvement saved, but the second adjustment resulted in a 4.5% reduction of water usage on the press. </p> <h2>Waste Footprint</h2> <p>With a focus on segregation and better resource management, total waste at the print sites fell by 13% or 191,980kgs. London achieved a 17% reduction in total waste, while both print sites saw improvement in recycling by 4% (Manchester now 84% and London 78%). Both sites also reduced hazardous waste, which includes solvents, plate developers and oil filters.</p> <p>Paper waste continues to be a focal point, given that it is a valuable resource, and recycling it, therefore, generates an income. </p> <p>Waste reductions and recycling Initiatives:</p> <p>Both print sites are looking for opportunities to reduce resource use in the print process as well as ensuring that currently unavoidable waste is segregated and recycled. </p> <p>It is not only paper that is valuable but also chemicals and aluminium print plates, given the sharp rise in world commodity prices. Further benefits are seen in general waste reductions due to an increase in separation, witnessed by a 55% (Manchester) and 19% (London) drop in general waste to landfill in the past 12 months.</p>",
  "<p>A few years ago, Guardian News and Media (GNM) set an ambitious challenge to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainability/sustainability-report-2012-carbon-positive\">carbon positive</a>.</p> <p>Carbon positive, for operations, means achieving best practice in reducing our direct and indirect environmental impacts and supporting social justice within the boundaries we can control or influence. </p> <p>Of course, carbon is only one of the issues we face in our operations. That is why we also concentrate on other key impacts such as resource consumption including water and paper as well as waste creation from across the business.</p> <p>GNM is planning to transform into a digital first company, which means that our impacts from traditional newspaper production will diminish over time while our digital environmental impacts will grow. </p> <p>In recognition of the importance of this, a board level sponsor, Tanya Cordrey, director of digital development, has been appointed to establish a leadership position in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainability/sustainability-report-2012-digital-sustainability\">digital sustainability</a>.</p> <p>We continue to commit to supporting research in this area through a number of collaborations that aim to make a genuine contribution to knowledge in this field.</p> <p>This year for the first time we include the carbon footprint of our digital operations in this report, based on the work by the <a href=\"http://www.sympact.org/\">Sympact project</a>. We believe we are also the first media companies to estimate our annual carbon footprint for the delivery of our website based on all users.<br> &#xa0;<br>This has been challenging, but we are pleased to be able to present an estimated carbon footprint of www.theguardian.com for the year 2011-12 to be in the magnitude of 10,000 tonnes CO2 equivalent \u2013 about a third of our current GNM footprint. </p> <p>We have tried to provide a simple overview of the methodology. However, if you would like to see the details of the model, they will be made available in a forthcoming peer-reviewed academic paper produced by Sympact and through our sustainability blog.</p> <p>Quality data collection and measurement is vital in this area of the business if we are to continue to improve our performance, which is why we have a section dedicated to this (Footprints). The operational activities we cover within this section of the report include:</p> <ul> <li>Office operations</li> <li>Digital operations</li> <li>Print operations</li> <li>Paper purchasing</li> <li>Procurement</li> </ul> <p>The financial year ending March 2012 proved predominantly positive in managing and reducing the negative elements of our environmental footprint. We lowered carbon emissions at sources where we have direct control (including offices, data centres, print sites and business travel) by 3%, saved 16% in water usage at the print sites, improved office recycling rates to 78%, lowered print waste by 13% and made advances in our sustainable paper sourcing.</p> <p>When purchasing paper we aim to balance price, quality, security of delivery, carbon emissions and sustainable paper sourcing. GNM refers to sustainable paper sourcing as paper fibre that is from a recycled or certified (ie FSC or PEFC) source.</p> <p>This means taking buying decisions that optimise the mix of sustainability characteristics for each paper grade. Individual purchasing decisions will, from time to time, involve trade-offs where an improvement in one area can be achieved only at the expense of another. </p> <p>In the past financial year, we have purchased more recycled paper from a new British mill. This decision increased overall carbon emissions, but we maintained our paper emission target of 370kg per tonne. </p> <p>In the same period, 98% of the newsprint and 94% of magazine-grade paper used for the Guardian and Observer was either recycled or used certified virgin fibre. </p> <p>Our total carbon footprint increased by 2% to 32,850tCO2e over the same period as a result of these paper-purchasing decisions and increased business travel. </p> <p>While sustainability audits report year-on-year changes, it is also important to consider the long-term performance of GNM. In fact, carbon emissions have fallen since our base year of 2009-10 by 25%. </p> <p>We have been collecting data on our directly controlled emissions (offices, print sites and business travel) for longer and these have reduced by 31% since our base line of 2008-09.</p> <p>This improvement is predominately the result of improved management, new efficient buildings, reduced pagination, smarter procurement and digital and print process optimisation across the business. </p> <p>Like any ambitious project, there have also been areas where we have struggled. Business travel emissions rose by 42% or 320tCO2e in the past financial year. Air travel rose by 52% or 240tCO2e and train travel by 32%. This is the second year to see an increase in air travel. </p> <p>We believe the majority of this increase is due to improved data collection, but the development of a strong presence in New York is having an impact. We are planning to work with our travel management company (see procurement section) to identify innovative ways to address this.</p> <p>In order to gauge the perceptions of our staff, we carried out a brief survey in June 2012, and 377 people responded out of a total of about 1,600. While 67% of respondents said they believed GNM has effective environmental practices in place, only 47% felt that GNM encourages them to take an active part reducing their environmental impact at work.</p> <p>To redress this, we recognise the need to ensure that actions we take in the field of sustainability also contribute to the core purpose of GNM. This will help ensure that senior and middle management support the desire of employees to make a difference. </p> <p>Secondly, we recognise we need constantly to work at improving communication, by letting staff know what actions we are taking and demonstrating the impacts they have. For example, we launched a Love Your Waste recycling campaign, which was initially successful but tailed off towards the end of the year as we did not effectively communicate progress. </p> <p>Because our largest impacts arise outside our direct control, we continue to identify and address sustainability through our procurement. Particular attention is paid to managing and reporting on the sustainability credentials of our key suppliers in the digital field.</p> <p>To further support our knowledge of sustainable procurement across the business, a number of workshops were held for staff. Working with the internal procurement team to look at how sustainable thinking could identify broader and more complex risks and opportunities that may influence or affect the business.</p> <p>While there is a growing emphasis at GNM on becoming a \"digital first\" company, our newspapers continue to play an important role, and we have made marked progress in limiting the environmental impacts of both our print sites and paper purchasing.</p> <p>Print site sustainability is all about efficiency gains, and our Manchester and Stratford plants have seen reductions in energy, natural resources and hazardous material through a systematic approach to monitoring, planning, testing and implementation.</p>",
  "<p>Digital products (ie websites and apps) are typically viewed as being \"carbon light\" or low-impact, and, as a result, there has been little pressure for suppliers or businesses to be accountable for the emissions or environmental impacts. </p> <p>This is in particularly stark contrast to the expectations of paper sourcing and manufacture of the public, NGOs and the sector itself.</p> <p>Delivering our digital products requires energy and produces carbon dioxide emissions, so it is important for us to understand more about what drives this demand for energy and what we can do about it. </p> <p>This is in addition to the depletion of natural resources, pollution and associated ecological impacts that result from demand for the physical equipment and the sources of energy generation through out the life cycle.</p> <p>We have been working to create a digital sustainability strategy, which aims to minimise our digital footprint while also maximising accessibility and the quality of our readers' experience, improving operational resilience and supporting commercial growth.</p> <p>Guardian News and Media (GNM) recognises that there is currently very little detailed research into digital media environmental impacts. It is also not clear where the boundaries of responsibility lie. Is it the computer hardware makers, the networks, the Guardian or the consumer who logs on to our website? </p> <p>This is largely due to the complexity of how digital systems and the internet works and interconnects. To rectify this GNM has been developing its own research in partnership with Bristol and Surrey universities.</p> <p>We teamed up with Bristol-based <a href=\"http://sympact.cs.bris.ac.uk/\">Sympact</a> to focus on developing a deeper understanding of the energy use and carbon dioxide emissions that result from the delivery of our digital products, such as theguardian.com.</p> <p>As a result, this year we have published an estimated carbon footprint of the guardian website for the financial year 2010-11 in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainability/sustainability-report-2012-digital-carbon-footprint\">separate digital footprint</a> section of the report.</p> <p>We have also been working with Stephen Wood, an engineering doctorate student at the University of Surrey, who is researching whether it is possible to reduce environmental impacts at the design stage of the software product development, in addition to improving operational efficiency of data centres and the hardware. This may take the form of curating content on the website to improve navigation and user experience.</p> <p>Sympact and Wood have been collaborating as well as working with Guardian staff to better understand what digital sustainability means for GNM. This integrated approach is key because the knowledge gained by the Sympact project is essential to assessing the potential impact of software design interventions and GNM's digital teams provide us with an understanding of which interventions are practically possible.&#xa0;</p> <p>In recognition of the importance of this issue, a board-level sponsor, Tanya Cordrey, director of digital development, has been appointed to establish a leadership position in digital sustainability.</p> <p>The immediate task for GNM as the sponsor is to ensure that outstanding data and information are collected to strengthen and complete the research. Subsequent responsibilities will be to oversee the transformation of the research into practical action and the implementation of a digital sustainability strategy in support of GNM's overall sustainability and digital first vision. </p> <p>Of course, in the digital field not everything is under our direct control so we have also been assessing our impacts through the supply chain.</p> <p>Clearly, one of the biggest impacts is our reliance on a global network of data centres for delivering digital services. Not only do we need to understand how to reduce our impacts in this area, we also need to think about the implications of increased digital energy demands and how resilient the digital first model is to the possibility of energy blackouts.</p> <p>The business also needs to be aware of future operational costs, legislative requirements, and reputational risks.</p> <h2>Why act?</h2> <p>The Guardian is driven to address and reduce the environmental impacts of digital media delivery as part of its carbon positive commitment to take climate change more seriously. </p> <p>The digital sustainability strategy also gives us the opportunity to engage with our audience, showcase our openness and demonstrate how we are contributing to a more sustainable future.</p> <p>On top of this, we hope to improve the design of our digital products, cut costs and reduce our carbon footprint across the value chain.</p> <p>We also recognise the risks from inaction, including opening ourselves to criticism that we are not living our values and failing to spot and address strategic risks such as energy security.</p> <h2>Key areas of attention</h2> <p><strong>Influencing behavioural change </strong><br>Many leading companies, such as 02 and Proctor &amp; Gamble, recognise the largest carbon impacts lie not in their direct operations but from the customers' use of their products and services. </p> <p>As a result, they have been developing strategies to encourage their customers to change their behaviour. That is sometimes through the development of new products \u2013 such as washing powder that allow customers to reduce the water temperature (Ariel 30) \u2013 as well as through providing information and education. </p> <p>GNM's sustainability vision already has a commitment to \"act as an agent of change for good through inspiring readers, customers and staff to change behaviours\".</p> <p>While our main concentration has been achieving this through our editorial content, we recognise the opportunity to improve our readers' understanding of their digital environmental footprint.</p> <p>One way of doing that is to develop interactive tools and personal internet energy monitors. One app created by our university partners was tested at the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainability/digital-carbon-footprint\">Open Weekend</a>.</p> <p>Other opportunities lie in encouraging readers to view our content on low-power devices, such as Kindle, iPad and smartphones.</p> <p>We can also encourage good power management practice on PCs and Macs, as well as recommending that home wi-fi networks are turned off overnight.</p> <p><strong>Operational efficiency</strong><br>Perhaps the most obvious action we can take is to reduce our carbon footprint by reducing the energy of the hardware in the data centres we use \u2013 whether owned by us in our own buildings and third party locations, or even equipment owned by cloud service providers, such as Google or Akamide.</p> <p>This could be through using less kit by virtualising physical servers or storage and using only what we actually need when we need it. Another way will be to buy equipment with greater energy efficiency and also evaluate the energy sources of the data centres.</p> <p>We also plan to undertake a sustainability risk assessment of our supply chain and produce a supplier code of conduct policy. This will allow us to apply due diligence to ensure sustainability principles are addressed in contracts to minimise risks to GNM.</p> <p>For more details of the challenges we face with our digital supply chain please see the procurement section. </p> <p><strong>Product development</strong><br>There is a need to build further engagement with the internal digital teams. One idea is to run a Hack Day or some form of interactive workshop to see how we can create a framework or language for building digital sustainability thinking in mainstream software development. </p> <p>It will also be important to engage with product&#xa0;teams&#xa0;about developing sustainability principles in design. </p> <p>This work will hopefully help to inform decisions in the product process, including design, development and maintenance. </p> <h2>Actions taken to reduce operational impact 2011-12</h2> <p><strong>Digital systems architecture</strong><br>The Guardian's digital systems team runs a large data centre to serve&#xa0;our&#xa0;global audience. It uses a significant amount of power to both run and cool it, and we are committed to reducing this where possible both from an emissions and a cost perspective. </p> <p>In the financial year 2011-12, we have looked extensively at using cloud processing where possible to take advantage of available scale (size) and efficiency. This will allow us to access more server processing power when we hit peak traffic demand rather than buy new kit that will be under-utilised. </p> <p>A good example of this is the way we are serving traffic to our highly successful Facebook application. Were we to do that from our data centres, we would have had to considerably increase the number of servers to cope with the rise in traffic. Instead, our <a href=\"http://apps.facebook.com/theguardian/\">Facebook application</a> is hosted entirely in the cloud, where capacity is allocated on demand. We believe that this has saved power, emissions and costs.</p> <p>A large proportion of&#xa0;our&#xa0;data centre equipment is now reaching the end of its life. By focusing on power consumption we have chosen suitable units with the lowest power needs and high energy efficiency.</p> <p>The shift to using cloud computing and the delivery of the new infrastructure are key objectives for the financial year 2012-13. These we believe will both lead to lower emissions and power costs while allowing us to keep pace with our digital ambitions at an affordable cost. </p> <p><strong>Office IT hardware procurement</strong><br>It's not only our online presence where we can make a difference; we also use a lot of IT equipment for our 1,600 staff, for example \u2013 desktop computers, printers, phones and office servers.</p> <p>Over the past financial year, we were able to reduce our energy use by further virtualising our servers. We're replacing about 58 of our servers with an equivalent platform of 20. This will reduce energy usage from 58kW to 20kW per hour, leading to savings of more than 300MWh per year or \u00a355,000, equivalent to 156 tonnes of CO2e.</p> <p>Other proposed plans are to reduce storage, given the proposed systems incorporate the latest innovations in power efficiency. This will decrease the server count, which should lead to savings of more than 460MWh per year, equivalent to 239 tonnes of CO2e.</p>",
  "<p>In this report, we are able for the first time to show the carbon footprint of our digital media operations. Guardian News and Media (GNM) has developed the methodology in partnership with the Sympact Project, researchers at the University of Bristol and Surrey. </p> <p>The estimated carbon footprint of providing content for www.guardian.co.uk and www.guardiannews.com, as well as for our audience to consume it, for the year 2011-12 is about 10,000 tonnes CO2e \u2013 around a third of our current overall business footprint. </p> <h2>Why</h2> <p>There is a perception that digital products (ie, websites, blogs and mobile apps) are typically viewed as being \"carbon light\" or low impact, especially compared with paper products. </p> <p>This is largely because people do not understand the complexity of the internet, given its global and opaque nature, and do not have a direct connection to the effects of their media consumption. </p> <p>We teamed up with Sympact to focus on developing a deeper understanding of the energy use and carbon dioxide emissions that result from the delivery of our digital products, such as&#xa0;guardian.co.uk. Sympact is joint-funded by the Research Councils UK Digital Economy and Energy Programmes.</p> <p>We are not doing this as a result of regulatory pressure, but to better understand the situation for ourselves and share our findings and approach with others in the industry to help stimulate debate and encourage the development of more sustainable digital products and services. </p> <h2>How it works</h2> <p>To build our stakeholders' understand it may be valuable to set out what happens when a webpage is accessed.</p> <p>As you use your laptop, tablet or smart phone, requests are sent from your device to a number of different server computers that build the components of the page, ie the template, text, pictures, video and adverts. </p> <p>These requests are transferred through your Wi-Fi modem or the 3G network via your internet service provider into the internet infrastructure or network and out to the server computers, which return the data.</p> <p>As set out in figure below, the path your request takes depends on which device you use, as this determines the access-network route into the internet infrastructure. The path through the internet network is driven by which server computers need to be accessed to provide data, which in turn is controlled by the type of request (ie video or text) and your geographical location. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397155545\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/17/1347873049412/LOV2012_Ops_Digital1-001.png\" alt=\"LOV2012_Ops_Digital1\" width=\"460\" height=\"410\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">GUARDIAN GRAPHICS</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So, in the case of the Guardian webpage, the template and text comes from our own data centre in London. But many of the other elements, such as images, video, audio, and advertising are often stored on third-party servers (such as content delivery networks) that are physically closer to the reader around the world. </p> <h2>The Findings</h2> <p>Based on this analysis, we can provide an estimate of the global energy footprint of reading the Guardian online. The estimated carbon footprint for the year 2011-12 from our web operations is in the magnitude of 10,000 tonnes of CO2e. As an absolute value, this figure should be used with caution as there remain considerable uncertainties due to some of the estimates and assumptions that we have had to make.</p> <p>But our primary goal for doing this work was not to report for the sake of it but to learn more about where emissions occur in this system \u2013 to guide us in knowing where we should concentrate our efforts in the future. As such, the findings have been revealing if not straightforward in the conclusions that we should draw. </p> <p>More details on the methodology of the model and complexities we faced will be published shortly on our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainability/blog\">sustainability blog</a>.</p> <p>Energy consumed using guardian online is heavily dependent on the equipment (customer device) being used because, at about 86%, this is the largest source of emissions of our footprint.

  "<p>Should the police now formally investigate allegations of rape and sexual abuse against Sir Jimmy Savile?</p> <p>After a woman reported a \"historic\" rape allegation on Monday, Scotland Yard <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/02/jimmy-savile-rape-claim\" title=\"\">said her claim would be \"reviewed and assessed\"</a>. However, no decision had been taken on whether to open a formal investigation.</p> <p>Also on Monday, Surrey police confirmed that they had interviewed Savile under caution in 2007 about sexual assault allegations dating back to the 1970s. No charges were brought after the Crown Prosecution Service advised that there was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/01/jimmy-savile-interviewed-police-sexual-allegations\" title=\"\">insufficient evidence to bring a case to court</a>.</p> <p>That should not come as much of a surprise. Allegations of rape or sexual assault are difficult enough to prove at the best of times, with often little or no corroboration. Savile's alleged victims would have had to satisfy a court that they had a clear recollection of events around 30 years ago. They would also have to explain why they had waited until the former television presenter was in his eighties before coming forward.</p> <p>Since then, of course, a number of other alleged victims have given interviews to journalists working on television documentaries. If the police had known about these allegations in 2007, that might have strengthened the case against Savile. But the women who came forward after Savile's death last year are unlikely to have known in 2007 that he was under investigation.</p> <p>Scotland Yard is now facing something of a dilemma. It is too late for Savile to be prosecuted. The police would be accused of wasting scarce resources if they conducted detailed investigations into allegations against a defendant who is no longer able to stand trial.</p> <p>On the other hand, people want to know whether these allegations can be substantiated. The police would be performing a valuable public service by collecting the available evidence.</p> <p>In my view, the police need to investigate whether there is evidence against anyone else who might be charged in connection with these allegations. To some extent, that requires detectives to make inquiries into the claims against Savile himself. But that is as far as it should go.</p> <p>And who might those other defendants be? There is no suggestion that Savile had an accomplice. <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/medianews/article3556774.ece\" title=\"\">Some newspapers</a> have pointed the finger at the BBC, both for failing to investigate allegations of abuse by a BBC presenter that may have taken place on BBC premises and for not broadcasting evidence of abuse obtained last year by Newsnight. Perhaps a declaration of interest is needed here: I was on the staff of the BBC for 25 years and still work for the corporation as a freelancer.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2012/10/newsnight_and_jimmy_savile.html\" title=\"\">editor of Newsnight has said</a> his team had no new evidence that would have helped the police. He knew the CPS had decided there was insufficient evidence for a prosecution. Whether you think that this was the right editorial decision rather depends on whether you think Newsnight should broadcast a celebrity expos\u00e9 of an individual who could no longer defend himself. There seem to be no issues of law here.</p> <p>The next question is whether the BBC was criminally liable for allowing abuse to take place on its premises. Might the BBC have been at fault for permitting vulnerable guests to visit presenters in dressing rooms at Television Centre? Could it be liable as a co-conspirator or even for what used to be called incitement and is now described as <a href=\"http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/h_to_k/inchoate_offences/#a01\" title=\"\">intentionally encouraging or assisting the commission</a> of an offence?</p> <p>Surely not. Imagine the outcry if Auntie had insisted on a chaperone. That would surely have been unsustainable. In general, an omission to act is not in itself a criminal offence. Nor is failing to prevent or report criminal conduct.</p> <p>There are exceptions, of course: parents are required to care for their children. Organisations that allow public access must ensure people's safety. Employers have duties to their staff. Gross failures in these cases may lead to criminal liability. But I cannot see how the BBC or any of its staff could be prosecuted for failing to stop a presenter from committing offences of this sort on its premises. As far as we know, nobody complained.</p> <p>Should the BBC have continued to use Savile? Here, the corporation may be on shakier ground. He was not on the staff, of course, but he must have signed countless BBC contracts. The current version of the BBC's standard contract requires presenters to not undermine the BBC's reputation for integrity and decency. The BBC could have sacked him or, at the very least, stopped putting him on the air.</p> <p>No doubt BBC managers told themselves that it would have been wrong to have dropped a popular presenter because of unsubstantiated allegations about his private life. There might be rather fewer stars on BBC programmes if that approach became widespread. If nothing had been proved, perhaps it would have been unfair, even discriminatory, to have stopped using him?</p> <p>Perhaps so. But some <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/03/bbc-jimmy-savile-abuse-claims\" title=\"\">former BBC bosses</a> must be feeling rather uncomfortable. The BBC is right to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/02/jimmy-savile-sexual-abuse-claims-bbc\" title=\"\">cooperate with the police investigation</a>. These days, it is much less willing to condone misbehaviour by people who work for it. Ultimately, though, its job is to make programmes. And it must feel pretty sore about the fact that it missed the chance to make one about Jimmy Savile.</p>",
  "<p>He has always seemed happy for his memorable performance as mob consigliere Silvio in The Sopranos to remain a one-hit wonder \u2013 his first and last unforgettable acting role. But that all changed when Steven van Zandt got a call from Norwegian TV. Now we have Lilyhammer, currently midway through its run on BBC4, in which Van Zandt plays New York mobster Frank \"The Fixer\" Tagliano, who rats out his crime-family boss after surviving an assassination attempt. As the title suggests, he then moves to Lillehammer under a witness-protection programme \u2013 becoming Giovanni \"Johnny\" Henriksen and building a new life far from the vengeful hoods who want him dead.</p> <p>Much as I loved Silvio I've found Lilyhammer a tough show to care about. Maybe I've been spoiled by those other Scandinavian imports Forbrydelsen, Borgen and The Bridge, all of which share a complexity and sophistication that demand full attention, stand up to repeated viewings and leave you buzzing for the next episode. Lilyhammer, on the other hand, leaves you much as it found you. Van Zandt's performance is as broad as one might expect: he doesn't so much act as do his Silvio thing. It's a mobster caricature, how you'd dress and act at a gangsters and molls party. There's nothing in the world wrong with that, just don't expect too many layers from him.</p> <p>Tonally, Lilyhammer is an odd show. The fish-out-of-water mobster bumping up against the safety-first bureaucratic nightmare of Norway feels very ITV Sunday night \u2013 and yet they have no problem throwing in the odd \"motherfucker\" (helpfully adding to the Scandinavian profanisaurus kicked off by Jan Meyer's \"For helvede Lund!\" in The Killing). It's Heartbeat with snowboots and swearwords.</p> <p>It's also a feature of the show that everything falls into Johnny's lap with the minimum of effort. Just four episodes in and he's already a bar owner, property developer and father (twice). I know he's Frank the Fixer but the writers here put less effort into solving problems than they did on Entourage. It's obviously an effort for Van Zandt to uproot to another continent, but Norway seems a long way to go to make a show that could have easily been made closer to home. Northern Exposure, which surely must be an influence, covered a lot of the same ground without leaving the US.</p> <p>Over on the right side of the law we see quite a nice mother-son relationship between chief of police, Laila, and her assistant, Geir. One of Norway's lesser Elvis impersonators, Geir may be a colossal idiot but there is something endearing about him \u2013 the brief friendship he has with a Sikh he ineptly racially profiles was one of the funnier moments from last night's show. Geir at least realises that there's something not right about Giovanni Henriksen even if he's a bit sketchy on the details.</p> <p>Given how slapdash law enforcement is with Johnny's records, it can't, in any case, be long before his New York enemies locate him. And it's not like he's keeping a low profile. He's cracking heads, making deals, using a child to intimidate some harmless old hippie out of his home \u2013 it's like he never left New York. The refrain on Boardwalk Empire is: \"You can't be half a gangster.\" So where does that leave Johnny? Is he in or out?</p> <p>I can't speak for him, but I think I'm out. Johnny may be impressed by the clean air, fresh white snow and gorgeous broads but Lilyhammer leaves me cold. How are you finding it? Bada-bing or fuggedaboutit? Let us know below.</p>",
  "<p>Credit to Daniel Radcliffe: after the spectacular success of the Harry Potter series there was probably a place for him as a sort of junior Hugh Grant, eking out a living in odious British rom-coms for the rest of his career. Instead, his next film is the dark fantasy Horns in which he plays a young man who everyone thinks has raped and killed his girlfriend. <a href=\"http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/10/02/daniel-radcliffe-horns-exclusive/\" title=\"\">The first picture from Horns has just hit the web.</a></p> <p>An adaptation of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/horror/9780575079168/horns\" title=\"\">Joe Hill's 2010 novel</a>, French director Alexandre Aja's film looks at first glance like it might be set in a sort of modern-day Narnia, with Radcliffe starring as an emo Mr Tumnus the faun. In reality the action (in the book at least) takes place in the small town of Gideon, New Hampshire, where 26-year-old Ignatius \"Ig\" Perrish wakes up one day to find he has sprouted a pair of horns which give him the power to divine people's innermost secrets (and occasionally compel them to indulge in their weirdest fantasies). Even more usefully, those in question then forget the conversation they have just had and seem to be entirely oblivious to Perrish's diabolical protrusions.</p> <p>Ig's major quandary is presumably whether to use the horns to track down the murderer and rapist who killed his girlfriend, Merrin Williams, some time previously. \"It's a very, very different type of part [to] anything I've done before,\" says Radcliffe, adding that the role is \"deeply emotional and also incredibly outrageous in some ways\". He adds: \"To play somebody who, in the midst of a time in his life of great turmoil anyway, undergoes this horrific transformation into a devil character \u2013 it was very, very exciting.\"</p> <p>According to Entertainment Weekly, which first posted the shot and picked up the quotes, Radcliffe is currently shooting in Vancouver. Will this be the 23-year-old actor's first foray into genuine adult fare after the slightly scary but hardly racy horror <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142855/woman-in-black\" title=\"\">The Woman in Black</a>? We'll find out some time next year \u2013 no release date yet \u2013 when the film hits cinemas.</p>",

The latest work by a young experimental practice, <a href=\"http://www.random-international.com/\">Random International</a>, Rain Room invites brave visitors to enter a hundred-square-metre downpour, without getting in the slightest bit wet.</p> <p>Set on a raised plinth at the end of the dark, curving corridor space, powerfully backlit by a glaring spotlight, the perfectly rectangular chunk of rain appears transposed from a parallel place, with the precision of a carefully staged experiment.</p> <p>As visitors step up on to the stage, these identical vertical lines of driving rain begin to be repelled, as if each body is giving off a kind of invisible magnetic field. As you step further in, the rain closes around you, enveloping each silhouetted figure in a perfect cylindrical void. It is a startlingly surreal experience.</p> <p>The apparently simple trick is the result of a lengthy period of development, which came out of playing with large-format printing.</p> <p>\"We started three years ago, testing temporary 'printing' with water, spraying droplets from above, like a long-distance ink-jet printer,\" says Florian Ortkrass, who founded Random International with fellow Royal College of Art design graduates Stuart Wood and Hannes Koch in 2005.</p> <p>\"But we became much more interested in how people would react to the piece,\" he explains. \"It's the same with all of our work: it doesn't make sense without anyone there.\"</p> <p>Their first piece involving participation was <a href=\"http://www.random-international.com/work/audience/\">Audience</a> (2008), a disconcerting field of mirrors that eerily turned to follow visitors as they walked between them, making the viewer both the active agent and subject of the piece. Two years later, their <a href=\"http://www.random-international.com/work/swarm-light/\">Swarm</a> installation translated the collective behaviour of a flock of birds into moving light. The sound of visitors stimulated the \"collective consciousness\" of a network of suspended LEDs, causing dynamic waves of light to ripple through the space.</p> <p>The group treats each project as part of an ongoing process of research into the relationship between people and new intelligent technologies, and has been working with the cognitive scientist <a href=\"http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/phil.barnard/\">Philip Barnard</a> to analyse people's behaviour.</p> <p>\"The best bit is watching what people do,\" says Ortkrass. \"It's either totally crazy, or utterly banal, but never what we're expecting.\"</p> <p>Behind the magic of each piece is a highly refined piece of technology. The Rain Room is controlled by a series of cameras that 3D-map the location of bodies on the plinth, translating this to a pixelated grid of 25cm x 25cm panels, each of which controls nine outlets \u2013 and a total of 2,500 litres of water, falling at a rate of 1,000 litres per minute, which is filtered, treated and recycled.</p> <p>The piece will play host to <a href=\"http://www.random-international.com/news/wayne-mcgregor-random-dance-max-richter-random-international/\">performances</a> choreographed by Wayne McGregor, with music scored by Max Richter, to be premiered during the Frieze Art Fair.</p>",

  "<p>Contracts for almost 400 NHS services, worth a quarter of billion pounds, were signed this week resulting in the \"biggest act of privatisation ever seen in the NHS\", Labour's health spokesman Andy Burnham has said.</p> <p>In a briefing before his speech to the Labour party conference, Burnham said he had \"evidence of accelerating privatisation\" \u2013 citing a rash of examples across England which he said showed the government was committed to a \"market in healthcare\".</p> <p>Burnham pointed out that non-emergency ambulance services in the north-west would soon be run by the bus group Arriva and that Lancashire county council had awarded the contract to run patient advocacy groups to a private firm, Parkwood Healthcare.</p> <p>However the \"biggest privatisation\" so far was in community services \u2013 those areas of healthcare offered outside of hospitals. Labour used freedom of information requests to survey England's NHS primary care trusts on the range and value of community services being offered to the private and voluntary sector under the government's \"any qualified provider\" policy.</p> <p>In the first wave, 398 contracts were signed this week in eight NHS areas \u2013 including musculoskeletal services for back pain, adult hearing services in the community, wheelchair services for children and primary care psychological therapies for adults.</p> <p>Labour says \u00a3262m of services have drawn bids from 37 private healthcare companies. In about a quarter of the cases \u2013 110 times \u2013 the health trusts stated \"they had no plans to tender before the government instruction\".</p> <p>Burnham said he was \"against the market in the NHS, not private companies\". He said the use of markets had seen \"care being fragmented and services becoming disjointed\". For example, in Lincolnshire six private providers compete to offer patients diagnostic tests as well as the NHS.</p> <p>The shadow health secretary also highlighted the fact that \"some private providers have failed to deliver the standard of service required, yet could be bidding for similar contracts in other parts of the country\". He cited the case of Serco's out-of-hours doctor services in Cornwall, which had \"falsified data\" to the NHS raising \"fundamental questions about the outsourcing of NHS services to the private sector\".</p> <p>Burnham said this was only the beginning. In 2013 the coalition will force another \u00a3750m of NHS services to be opened to competition from private companies and charities. The government argues that it has only put services out for \"competition on quality not price\" and if the policy is judged successful non-NHS bodies will be allowed to deliver more complicated clinical services in maternity and \"home chemotherapy\" from next year.</p> <p>The coalition's Health and Social Care Act also in effect allows hospitals to treat as many private patients as NHS patients \u2013 raising fears that the \"paying ill\" may be able to jump the queue in healthcare. Burnham said the government had created a \"financial climate that will incentivise hospitals to look at the new rules on private patients as a source of much-needed income\".</p> <p>Labour said it had examined hospital trust papers \u2013 and found a number planning to increase income by attracting paying patients. Buckinghamshire healthcare trust, which provides care to over half a million patients, says it aims to \"double its private income over the next year\". The Chelsea and Westminster hospital trust admits there is \"considerable scope to ramp up its private patient work\". Even in Burnham's own constituency his local hospital in Wrightington was \"establishing a new private patient unit\".</p> <p>Burnham said he would revive Labour's 2009 plan that NHS organisations were to be the service's preferred provider of care. This policy collapsed after a legal challenge by private companies just before the last election. However, the shadow health secretary said that in government Labour would \"strip out the competition oversight\" from the economic regulator Monitor.</p> <p>\"We have taken legal advice from a senior QC that if you build the system around NHS agreements you can insulate the system from competition law. Healthcare is essentially a public service and EU member states can protect public services in that way.\"</p> <p>In his speech to the party, Burnham said the \"next Labour government will repeal Cameron's [Health and Social Care] Act. We will stop the sell-off, put patients before profits, restore the N in NHS.\"</p> <p>Burnham admitted that in office Labour had gone too far in promoting competition in the health service. He told the conference that \"while [Labour] brought waiting lists down to record lows, with the help of the private sector, at times we let the market in too far. Some tell me markets are the only way forward. My answer is simple: markets deliver fragmentation; the future demands integration.\"</p> <p>He also said the party had signed off on some \"PFI deals [that] were poor value for money\" and \"at times, care of older people simply wasn't good enough\".</p> <p>Sources close to the Tory health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said Labour was being disingenuous about its role in promoting competition in the NHS \u2013 with the party introducing market-based reforms almost a decade ago. \"Burnham is promising another bill to replace the existing structures. That's a Labour promise of massive upheaval in the system again.\"</p>",
  "<p>A key conceit of Ireland's \"Celtic tiger\" boom involved reading economic growth in cultural terms. The \"boom\" was attributed not only to the genius of exceptional political leadership, but also to a fundamental shift in values among the wider population. Neoliberalism and the liberalisation of society were in harmony, and if this didn't quite signal the end of history, it marked a definitive break with a past often represented as a long dark night of conflict, emigration, and the suffocating hegemony of the Catholic church.</p> <p>As society in Ireland continues to be forced to pay for the consequences of boom-time speculation, it may well be that it is the present that is more of a foreign country. However, as the renewed public focus on the systemic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalene_asylum\" title=\"\">abuse of the Magdalene laundries</a> indicates, the conceit of a \"past\" transcended was as ideologically self-serving as the elite desire to represent the property bubble as proud proof of national arrival.</p> <p>Last week, a <a href=\"http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0926/magdelene-laundries-apology-motion-defeated.html\" title=\"\">Sinn F\u00e9in private members motion in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann</a> urged the government to issue a long-overdue apology to the survivors of the Magdalene laundries, an act that would <a href=\"http://www.magdalenelaundries.com/name.htm\" title=\"\">allow them to draw pensions and access a reparations scheme</a>. The government argued that it was obliged to wait until the end of the year for the final report of the inter-departmental committee investigating state involvement with the laundry system, and the motion was defeated.</p> <p>In reacting to what was widely regarded as another stalling tactic \u2013 by a state that has cynically sought to extract itself from responsibility for these \"private institutions\" \u2013 the survivor advocacy group <a href=\"http://www.magdalenelaundries.com/press_releases.htm#250912\" title=\"\">Justice for Magdalenes</a> noted the injustice of needlessly prolonging the wait of a diminishing group of elderly women. They are entitled not only to restitution for their incarceration in a brutal system, but recompense for their labour, having been exploited and enslaved in washing the clothes of a society where they were hidden in plain sight.</p> <p>The implacable callousness of the state has at least served to refocus attention on the nature and scale of the unlawful imprisonment imposed on \"deviant\" populations. <a href=\"http://www.thejournal.ie/magdalene-laundry-true-story-margaret-bullen-samantha-long-614350-Sep2012/\" title=\"\">The Journal.ie</a> published an account by Samantha Long of a meeting with her mother Margaret Bullen, who, when she met her at the age of 42, \"looked like a pensioner\". Sent to Gloucester St Magdalene Laundry at the age of 16, she died 35 years later, after a life deemed worthy of little else than hard labour and abuse. In The Irish Times, <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2012/0925/1224324359767.html\" title=\"\">Fintan O'Toole</a> drew on <a href=\"http://us.macmillan.com/coerciveconfinementinpostindependenceireland/EoinOSullivan\" title=\"\">Eoin O'Sullivan and Ian O'Donnell's book Coercive Containment in Ireland</a> to place the laundries in the context of a highly organised \"shadow system of confinement\" that also encompassed industrial schools, psychiatric hospitals and \"mother and baby homes\", and where \"at any given time between 1926 and 1951 \u2026 1% of the entire population\" was incarcerated.</p> <p>Given the acute testimonies of suffering and the sheer scale of the systemic abuse, public debate has sought parallels and allusions in other histories. The <a href=\"http://corkindependent.com/stories/item/11857/2012-39/O%E2%80%99Brien-calls-for-immediate-Magdalene-survivors-apology\" title=\"\">Labour TD Michael McCarthy</a> described the Magdalene laundries as \"our own Holocaust\". With far less exaggeration and more analytical precision, O'Toole described it as an \"Irish gulag system\".</p> <p>Historical resonances are important, but there is a danger in replicating the stark division of Irish history into a benighted Catholic past and a better, liberal present. Ireland continues to produce and confine \"problematic\" populations, only now it is not \"fallen women\" and the problematic working class locked up by a patriarchal church and state, but the <a href=\"http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745631653\" title=\"\">\"human waste\"</a> of a fragile global economy, migrants locked up by states committed to stemming human mobility while tapping the mobility of capital.</p> <p>At present, approximately 6,000 people live in <a href=\"http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving_country/asylum_seekers_and_refugees/services_for_asylum_seekers_in_ireland/direct_provision.html\" title=\"\">direct provision accommodation centres</a> in Ireland while their asylum claims are processed. Originally introduced as an \"emergency measure\" in 1999 to speed up asylum determination procedures, over a third have been in this system for more than three years, and waits of seven or eight years are not unheard of. Unable to access education, employment or frequently even to cook for themselves, asylum-seekers are accommodated and fed, and granted an adult weekly allowance of \u20ac19.10 (rates that have not changed in real terms since their introduction over a decade ago). For this other population, also corralled and controlled outside of society, it is unsurprising that anxiety, depression and ill health are widespread.</p> <p>No comparison should obscure the particular forms of violence and suffering that mark different experiences. But the parallels are politically important. Ill health scarred the lives of children in industrial schools \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.atlanticphilanthropies.org/learning/report-state-sanctioned-child-poverty-and-exclusion\" title=\"\">a recent report</a> has documented the appalling conditions and health problems of the children of asylum seekers, who constitute one-third of the population of the direct provision system. According to O'Toole, thousands of people died each decade in the neglectful conditions of psychiatric hospitals \u2013 in September Emmanuel Marcel Landa became the latest person to die in the direct provision system, and <a href=\"http://www.irishrefugeecouncil.ie/news/congolese-asylum-seeker-dies-in-accommodation-centre/1415\" title=\"\">as Sue Conlon of the Irish Refugee Council noted</a>, \"the impact of long delays, lengthy residence in direct provision accommodation and the real threat of deportation may well have been a contributory factor in Mr Landa's untimely death\". The forced separation of the wrong type of families mocked the Catholic emphasis on the sanctity of the family \u2013 today a hugely costly and ineffective deportation system separates families, and <a href=\"http://www.irishleftreview.org/2012/10/02/antideportation-ireland-launches-campaign-direct-provision-deportation/\" title=\"\">deports children born in Ireland to \"home countries\" they have never been to</a>.</p> <p>It is an easy argument that \"we must look after our own\", especially in an acute recession. However, the history of the \"Irish gulag\" illustrates the thinness of any such national fiction. Further, the system of direct provision, introduced during the \"boom times\", must be <a href=\"http://plutopress.wordpress.com/tag/alexandra-hall/\" title=\"\">understood primarily as a politicised system of deterrence and control</a>. It is this systemic violence that unites the wasted lives of the \"immoral\" and \"deviant\" subjects of the past, and the \"bogus\" and \"undeserving\" of the present.</p> <p>In one of her last pieces on a system she did so much to investigate, the late Mary Raftery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/08/irealnd-magdalene-laundries-scandal-un?fb=native&amp;CMP=FBCNETTXT9038\" title=\"\">noted that \"Irish society was deeply complicit in the incarceration of women and girls in the laundries\"</a>. There are <a href=\"http://www.swp.ie/content/hundreds-march-galway-save-asylum-centre\" title=\"\">faint but hopeful signs</a> that contemporary Irish society may recognise its complicity in the abuse of asylum-seekers, and organise to <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/1002/breaking35.html\" title=\"\">support</a> and <a href=\"http://antideportationireland.blogspot.fi/\" title=\"\">defend</a> them.</p>",
  "<p>The battle over voting rights in the November presidential election now swings to South Carolina, following the decision by the Pennsylvania courts on Tuesday to delay implementation of a voter ID requirement in that state.</p> <p>All eyes are now on the legal tussle between the department of justice and South Carolina, where probably the last voter ID law will be decided before election day on 6 November.</p> <p>Last year South Carolina became one of at least 34 states to introduce strict laws that require voters to present photo identification at polling stations \u2013 one of a swathe of measures attacking voting rights that swept across the US this election cycle.</p> <p>South Carolina's law was blocked, however, by the Obama administration last June.</p> <p>The department of justice wielded its powers under section 5 of the 1965 voting rights act \u2013 a safeguard introduced after desegregation in the deep south to prevent designated areas from changing voting procedures without federal government approval in advance.</p> <p>The blocking power was designed consciously to counter the old Jim Crow laws of the south, where African Americans were routinely denied the right to vote on spurious technical grounds.</p> <p>The justice department's final decision over the South Carolina's voter ID law is now pending and could be announced as early as this week. It is also possible, though, that a final ruling will be postponed until after the presidential election.</p> <p>The assault on voting rights has been one of the epic themes of the 2012 election cycle, with states moving on an unprecedented scale to erect barriers to easy access to the polling booth. A <a href=\" http:// www.brennancenter.org/pages/about/\">tally by the Brennan Center for Justice in New York</a> itemised at least 180 restrictive bills in 41 states<br>over the past two years, of which 15 laws were actually passed in 19 states.</p> <p>The laws included a range of different threats to voting, of which the imposition of a requirement for photo ID cards was just the most common. Other laws required proof of citizenship at the polling station; at least 16 states introduced bills that would make it harder to register to vote; and at least nine have tried to end early voting.</p> <p>But if 2012 has been the presidential election that saw a widespread attack on voting rights, it has also been a year that has seen a dramatic counter-offensive that has effectively neutralised most of the most egregious new laws. In no fewer than in 14 states have there been moves to <a href=\"http:// www.thenation.com/sites/default/files/user/20/Voting_Law_Changes_Pushback_2012- 4.png\">repeal, postpone or judicially overturn the provisions</a>.</p> <p>In addition to South Carolina, the justice department used section 5 to block voter ID laws in Texas and Florida, the governors of six states wielded their vetoes, and there have been court cases settled or pending in seven states.</p> <p>The intervention of judges around the country to hold back some of the harsher legislation has been notable aspect of the 2012 battle over voting rights. Lawrence Norden of the Brennan Center said that a common feature of judges' rulings against the voter ID laws had been \"a recognition that a lot of this stuff has been politically motivated. It was not about improving the voting system, but about gaming the system.\"</p> <p>Some of the judges made the thought that political skulduggery explicit in their<br>deliberations. A federal judge, Robert Hinkle, was scathing about a provision introduced by Florida that would penalise charities if they lodged new voter registrations with election officials more than 48 hours after they were completed.</p> <p>Striking down the provision, Hinkle said: \"If the goal is to discourage voter-registration drives and thus also to make it harder for new voters to register, the 48-hour deadline may succeed. But if the goal is to further the state's legitimate interests without unduly burdening the rights of voters and voter registration organizations, 48 hours is a bad choice.\"</p> <p>When the Pennsylvania supreme court heard legal argument on the state's new voter ID law last month, one justice, Seamus McCaffery, wondered aloud why the legislature was in such a rush to implement the act in November. \"Could there be politics, maybe?\" he asked.</p> <h2>Planning for beyond November</h2> <p>While it seems the bulk of the threat to voter rights has been neutralised in<br>this presidential election cycle by the combination of judicial, gubernatorial<br>and electoral push-backs, in the longer term the danger is by no means<br>over. As the NAACP is pointing out this week with the launch of a new<br>campaign called <a href=\"http://action.naacp.org/page/-/advocacy%20papers/Silenced-%20Citizens%20Without%20a%20Vote%20Full.pdf\">Silenced: Citizens Without a Vote</a>, there are almost 6 million citizens in the US who have been stripped of their votes as a result of having been convicted of a felony. That is equivalent to one out of every 40 American adults.</p> <p>Four states \u2013 Florida, Virginia, Kentucky and Iowa \u2013 effectively permanently disenfranchise anyone with a felony conviction, even after they have fully served their sentence. Benjamin Jealous, NAACP's president, called the laws outrageous: \"This is a country in which we believe voting is a right, in which all people should have a second chance,\" he told MSNBC.</p> <p>Elisabeth MacNamara, president of the League of Women Voters which has an active voter registration programme in several states, said there was still the danger of considerable confusion among the electorate before November. \"We are having to scramble to make up for months of lost time because of these laws,\" she said.</p> <p>Beyond November, the voting rights issue is likely to raise its head again as legislatures who have had their efforts foiled move to reintroduce the offending legislation. Some rulings, including Tuesday's court judgment in Pennsylvania, have only delayed rather than eradicated the new voter ID laws which are likely to come into effect next year in the absence of any further opposition.</p> <p>In addition, several places, including Texas and Arizona and parts of Alabama and North Carolina, are gearing themselves up to challenging section 5 itself. They argue that they should no longer be subjected to federal restrictions, though many voting rights experts remain suspicious of their motivations.</p> <p>\"Unfortunately, I think we will continue to see these battles well after the election,\" Norden said. \"The fight is definitely still on-going.\"</p>",

  "<p>I've been asked what the point of national polls is. The question was posed because, with the electoral college system, this election is going to be decided in the swing states. Indeed, most voters have pretty much <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2012/oct/election-2012-vote-makes-difference#custom/a0/s0/r0/e0/l0\">no chance at casting the decisive vote</a>.</p> <p>But here are five reasons why I believe national polls are and should remain an important part of any election coverage.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>1). National polls can tell us what the real issues are</strong></p> <p>You know with the back-and-forth of the horse race coverage, it's sometimes hard to forget that elections are ultimately about issues. After the election occurs, politicians are going to have to go to Washington and try to solve the problems facing this country.</p> <p>Politicians should know what Americans' positions on healthcare, medicare, economic stimulus, the environment, etc are. We often elect individuals for many different reasons than they think. Few would think that we elected President Obama in 2008 because the majority agreed with <a href=\"http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2012/01/70-of-american-voters-disagree-with-obama-favor-increased-access-to-oil-and-gas-resources/\">all of his position stances</a>. Likewise, it's difficult to believe that Republicans took the House in 2010 because Americans were upset with President Obama's <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/court.htm\">supreme court picks</a>. </p> <p>Without polls on issues with the national electorate, politicians could make all sorts of claims and <a href=\"http://www.publicopinionpros.norc.org/features/2007/jan/lavrakas_printable.asp\">there couldn't be any factual repudiation</a>. Now, politicians may still make inaccurate statements with regard to what elections mean, but at least we have the numbers to know they are overstepping their mandate.</p> <p><strong>2). People in the non-swing states matter, too</strong></p> <p>We may have an electoral college, but that doesn't mean voters in non-swing states don't matter. The only reason safe blue and red states aren't \"important\" is because their outcomes are decided. Another way to look at it, however, is that these non-swing states are actually the vast majority of the country. Yes, Ohio is important in this election, but politicians shouldn't kowtow to their interests only. Presidents are the leader of all the United States, not just the chosen 10 or so swing states.</p> <p><strong>3). The swing states may not <em>be</em> the swing states</strong></p> <p>It's silly to think that the states that were <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/05/18/romney_faces_a_blue_wall_--_but_is_it_solid.html\">swing states last time around will be the same this time</a>. Especially early in the campaign, national polls probably tell a better story of where the electorate is. Had we just relied on the old idea that Missouri was the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_bellwether\">ultimate bellwether</a>, as it once was, we would have thought that John McCain was in good position in 2008. This year, we believe Ohio is the ultimate swing state, but perhaps it won't be, given President Obama's <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-ohio-president-romney-vs-obama\">solid lead there</a>.</p> <p><strong>4). National polls are <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/blogs/2010-06-17-silver-election-error.png\">usually more accurate than state surveys</a></strong></p> <p>Does anyone <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/content/obama-leading-romney-9-fla-no-way\">really believe</a> that Mitt Romney is down by anywhere close to 10 points in Florida, as Quinnipiac found? There are so many national polls that outliers don't move polling averages as much, making them more accurate and reliable.</p> <p>The national polls are also often conducted by better firms than the statewide polling is. Anyone ever heard of Gravis Marketing, before 2012? I hadn't. I don't mean to pick on Gravis (although they have had a huge Republican <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/simon-jackman/skewed-polls-nonsense_b_1923107.html?utm_hp_ref=@pollster\">house effect</a>), but they are typical of many state pollsters. They tend to have small sampling periods, don't call cellphones, and just don't have a track record of any kind. I know when I read a national poll from ABC/Washington Post or NBC/Wall Street Journal that I'm getting quality data from tested sources.</p> <p>That's not to say that we should dismiss state polling. In fact, I spend most of my days looking at state data. It does seem that President Obama <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/09/24/1135190/-Daily-Kos-Elections-Polling-Wrap-Republicans-cling-to-national-polls-must-ignore-awful-state-polls\">may be doing better</a> in the swing states than the national numbers indicate. Still, national polling can provide a nice check on whether state numbers are out-of-whack.</p> <p><strong>5). The chance that the winner of the popular vote differs from the state vote is just not large</strong></p> <p>It should be recognized that a national poll is pretty representative of the swing states at large. In any given election, there's only a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/23/chances-bush-gore-tie-2012\">3-5% chance</a> that the electoral college winner will differ from the national vote winner. That chance is pretty much zero if the national polls continue to show Obama leading Romney by 3-4 percentage points. Even if the national margin were to shrink to 1 percentage point, the chance that the electoral college winner would be different is only 25%.</p> <p>Even if we did get inside a 1-point national vote, it's not particularly clear that swing state polls would provide much clarity. We would know what states would provide the winning margin. Yet, polling margin of errors are large enough that once we get this close, we really wouldn't have that much of a better idea about who would win. Remember in 2000 when <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:If7pIAfUT34J:www.columbia.edu/~ks20/Erik-sig-web-battleground.pdf+2000+gore+electoral+college&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShrPVkfKplN7GyN8PAUisANl8Lf5OL3dZjUBcGMciRDY3bBLrd8Y6EtOJ7VF1wyTt7PWCdkpnLjkZCrJtUyFag3Mv1pgWJKhw8_QjORr9qyw44OMo7b6tRhNl3rSQPum0YCZ2AU&amp;sig=AHIEtbQjYY9WmOTe-JQ3ewhI9gX0WbmO0Q\">many thought</a> Al Gore would lose the popular vote and win the electoral college, but the opposite happened?</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>National polls are an important complement to state data. They don't tell the whole story, but they give us a lot of important information regarding both where the electorate is and why it is where it is.</p>",
  "<p>There is growing dissatisfaction with the technical and technocratic emphasis in innovation, as progress doesn't seem to have been made in fixing some of society's most severe problems.</p> <p>Attention is now growing around people-centred innovation, which creates a participatory, practice-based process to find sustainable new strategies for a socially and sustainable future.</p> <p>This approach has been given impetus by a paper from the European Union's thinktank <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/bepa/pdf/publications_pdf/social_innovation.pdf\" title=\"\">Empowering people, driving change \u2013 social innovation in the European Union</a>, which said \"the long-held belief that economic growth creates employment and wealth that goes on to alleviate poverty has been disproved by recent events, and the time has now come to try new ways of bringing people out of poverty and promoting growth and well-being not only for, but also with citizens\".</p> <p>As a result, the European Commission is looking wider than the usual suspects of governments and traditional institutions, to solve problems and is reaching out to work with social entrepreneurs, designers, active citizens and other change makers. This is quite a daunting task because these unusual suspects are often far from Brussels and not very interested in EU policies.</p> <p>Moreover, social innovation is by nature experimental, cross cutting, collaborative and dispersed. Social innovators are comfortable working with uncertainty, without blueprints, roadmaps or clear-cut business plans. Not a great fit with the bureaucratic culture of the EC which is risk averse, focused on financial control and keen on projected outputs. Two distinct worlds, that do not mingle well.</p> <p>It means that social Innovation requires innovation in the social model of the EU itself.</p> <p>An interesting encounter between these two distinct worlds was set up in Naples in 2011. The <a href=\"http://www.euclidnetwork.eu/\" title=\"\">Euclid Network</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.unicreditfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">UniCredit Foundation</a> ran an international social innovation competition called Naples 2.0 to mobilise global brainpower to provide concrete solutions to social challenges identified by the citizens of Naples.</p> <p>Why Naples you might wonder? A city of beauty and squalor, of failing government and organized crime. But Naples has a long tradition of citizens taking things in their own hands and coming up with creative solutions when none seem possible. Why a competition? Because no one or no idea is ruled in or out and the prize rewards creativity.</p> <p>Seven prize winners received help to develop their business plans, one is on track for \u20ac150,000 of funding for a local catering business. Naples 2.0 was the first competition of its kind and was followed with interest by the EC. The key was to engage local people in issues that were difficult to solve. It demanded that everyone \u2013 organisers, funders and innovators \u2013 had to be willing to invest time and money without knowing the outcome. Ultimately this is social innovation.</p> <p>Building on this experience, EC president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso is launching the commission's first social innovation competition on 1 October, in co-operation with <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Nesta</a> and Euclid, and in memory of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogo_Vasconcelos\" title=\"\">Diogo Vasconcelos</a> \u2013 the fighter for social innovation who spent his career trying to bridge the gap between citizens and the political system, who tragically died last year.</p> <p>The competition is geared to creating a strong platform for social innovators across Europe. A courageous experiment to unlock the enormous potential; the passion and the power of the people.</p> <p>But, can a competition bridge the gap between citizens and politics? Competitions are cost-effective, create a level playing field so anyone can come up with an extraordinary solution to a challenge or problem. Whether this is the perfect instrument for traditional institutions to foster and stimulate social innovation is too early to say. But it is an attempt to shift the focus to the people, to grass roots initiatives and to what works in daily life.</p> <p>Euclid Network will bring experience and ideas to the new competition in the coming months to see if we can identify successful local initiatives and also create a learning network where ideas can flourish \u2013 to foster a fertile ecosystem for social innovation.</p> <p>Enthusiasm for social innovation does not exempt the EC from innovation in its own practices and policy making. There is a real need to bring more dynamic processes into play and focus on creating valuable outcomes for the people of Europe which are far more than bean counting or balancing the books.</p> <p>An important step is to realise that focusing on actively engaging people, and not just on economic growth, is the route to a socially sustainable future. From this can come a better functioning EU and a more democratic and liveable society.

  "<p>In the run-up to Paris fashion week, all conversation has centred on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/2012/sep/26/paris-fashion-week-slimane-simons\">the duel between Raf Simons, the designer who replaced the disgraced John Galliano at Dior, and Hedi Slimane,</a> the designer behind the influential Dior Homme skinny silhouette who has taken the reins at Yves Saint Laurent. Here were two big designers staging debut ready-to-wear collections for two of the biggest Parisian houses in fashion history. It was set to be the story of fashion week. </p> <p>Turns out, though, that the real fight is taking place off the catwalks, between New York Times fashion critic Cathy Horyn and Slimane. Yesterday, following a day of fairly lukewarm reviews for Slimane's debut \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/2012/oct/02/paris-fashion-week-yves-saint-laurent?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\">Guardian's fashion editor Jess Cartner-Morley said </a>\"where this collection felt lacking was in relevance to the real world of what is worn on the streets of Paris and London\" \u2013 Horyn, who was not invited to the show, reviewed the collection for the <a href=\"http://runway.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/02/saint-laurent-back-at-the-chateau-marmont/\">New York Times on the Runway blog. </a></p> <p>In this piece, Horyn explained why she had not been given a ticket to the show. \"I was not invited,\" she said. \"Despite positive reviews of his early YSL and Dior collections, as well as a profile,<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/06/nyregion/future-take-note-raf-simons-was-here.html\"> Mr Slimane objected bitterly to a review I wrote in 2004</a> \u2013 not about him but Raf Simons. Essentially I wrote that without Mr Simons's template of slim tailoring and street casting, there would not have been a Hedi Slimane \u2013 just as there would never have been a Raf Simons without Helmut Lang. Fashion develops a bit like a genetic line.\" </p> <p>Horyn goes on to say that she thought that Slimane felt that she had favoured Simons's menswear ever since. Raising this ban with Slimane's boss, Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, the chief executive of PPR, which owns Saint Laurent, Horyn reports that he described this as \"ridiculous\" and said: \"Journalists should be invited to shows.\" </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397102236\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/3/1349261234103/Hedi--Slimane-007.jpg\" alt=\"Hedi  Slimane\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">French-born fashion designer Hedi Slimane appears at the end of Saint Laurent's spring/summer 2013 collection presented in Paris on Monday. Photograph: Jacques Brinon/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacques Brinon/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Following the publication of Horyn's piece online, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hedislimanetwit/status/253205847075848192/photo/1/large\">a response from Slimane appeared on his Twitter page</a>. It called Horyn a \"schoolyard bully and also a little bit of a standup comedian\". </p> <p>Mocked up with a faux New York Times font and a headline reading \"Miss Cathy, Freedom of the Press\", it goes on to question her personal style (\"I also hear that her sense of style is seriously challenged\") and her agenda (\"thick\" and \"predictable\"). It concluded that she would never get a seat at Saint Laurent but might get a \"2 for 1 at Dior\". </p> <p>When asked to comment on this alleged statement from their new creative head, the house of Yves Saint Laurent has so far only told the Guardian that Slimane tweeted it from his personal account and therefore it is \"outside [our] territory\". </p> <p>This is in contrast to the weeks building up to Slimane's debut when constant emails from the PR team where sent to the media explaining the brand's name change from Yves Saint Laurent to Saint Laurent and requesting only certain images of the designer be used to illustrate any features on the brand. During the summer, the Guardian was asked to change a picture of the designer used in a feature to one of the \"official Saint Laurent portraits\".</p> <p>Other journalists and editors have also taken up these issues: the Times' fashion editor Laura Craik wrote an open letter to Slimane this morning while <a href=\"http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/columns/lisa-armstrong/TMG9579726/Paris-Fashion-Week-Hedi-Slimanes-Saint-Laurent-debut.html\">the Telegraph's Lisa Armstrong also questioned the way many aspects of Slimane's appointment had been dealt with. </a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.businessoffashion.com/2012/10/a-wake-up-call-for-ysls-pr-team.html\"> In addition, Imran Amed, founder and editor-in-chief of influential website The Business of Fashion, who was also excluded from the Saint Laurent show, published an exposing piece</a>. He criticised the entire Saint Laurent PR strategy, pointing out times when he has been asked to amend tweets and features related to the brand that the team were reportedly not happy with. He wrote of \"a series of bizarre communications from a PR team whose attempts to control communication about YSL \u2013 whether coming directly from the brand itself or independent media outlets \u2013 seems obsessive\". </p> <p>Despite the ban, Amed managed to get himself into the show to see what the fuss was about. He describes the collection as something that \"wasn't going to change the future of women's fashion\", and that \"the somewhat muted applause and hushed voices after the show were the most telling\".</p> <p>He concludes that the entire episode shows arrogance and a misunderstanding about how to develop brands in today's world. \"It's a serious wake-up call for a PR team that is clearly living in the pre-digital age,\" he says.</p>",
  "<p>A spectre is haunting Europe. The memory of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/02/eu.france2\" title=\"\">2005 national referendums rejecting the EU constitution</a> has led political leaders to respond to the current crisis with emergency measures that don't require popular approval. But longer-term solutions demand democratic legitimation.</p> <p>The commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, has gone so far as to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19568781\" title=\"\">call for a federation of nation states</a>. Germany's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_Westerwelle\" title=\"\">Guido Westerwelle</a>, together with eight other foreign ministers, recently proposed fundamental reforms that might lead to a two-speed Europe \u2013 so long as a qualified majority of member states approved, their new treaty would bind them even if the other states do not go along. Such sweeping revisions can't be achieved without popular consent.</p> <p>Direct democracy is a risky business. Europe should not repeat the organisational mistakes that contributed to the debacle of 2005. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jun/13/eu.politics1\" title=\"\">constitutional convention</a> then produced a 350-page text written in legalistic language that mystified ordinary voters. Worse still, nothing special was done to encourage citizens to deliberate seriously on the fateful choice before them. Little wonder that national debates were largely dominated by the petty politics of the moment.</p> <p>This time around, Europe should follow the example of <a href=\"http://www.southafrica.info/about/democracy/constitution.htm#.UGwQEr9y9E4\" title=\"\">South Africa</a>'s successful three-stage experiment in constitutional creation. During the first stage, participants simply tried to hammer out a statement of basic principles. Only later did they follow through with a long legalistic text elaborating the new social contract. Finally, it was up to South Africa's constitutional court to confirm that the long-form legalisms conformed to the initial principles.</p> <p>To put this sequence in European terms, the project should follow current treaties by organising a convention representing national and European parliaments, heads of state and governments, and the European commission. This body would focus on formulating readily comprehensible constitutional principles \u2013 which could then be revised by an intergovernmental conference.</p> <p>This statement, for example, would set out the broad powers granted the union, but not a detailed list of competences; it would establish principles of representation in European bodies, but not elaborate voting rules. Following the recent proposal by the foreign ministers, it would also say how many EU members must ratify before the final treaty springs into operation between the consenting parties.</p> <p>Phase one ends with each member state accepting or rejecting the statement of principles \u2013 by referendum or parliament, depending on the particular constitution. The straightforward character of the principles will be especially important in countries such as France (certainly) and Germany (probably) that will take the direct democracy route.</p> <p>Nationalist opponents could no longer denounce an impenetrable treaty as part of a vast, Eurocratic conspiracy. Voters will confront their choices in no-nonsense terms. They may vote yes or no, but they are less likely to succumb to populist demagogy. The focus on principles will also help countries debate the need to amend their national constitutions (as may well be the case in Germany).</p> <p>When referendums take place, citizens will also vote for national representatives to the second-stage convention that hammers out the final text. Since rival candidates will take different positions on the statement of principles, their debate will help voters better understand the basic issues raised by the referendum. If the citizenry votes yes, the popular selection of delegates will create another democratic link to the final document, further enhancing its legitimacy.</p> <p>The second convention won't be free to abuse its popular mandate by departing from the fundamental principles. It will instead submit its work-product to a special court that will guarantee compliance. The president of the European court of justice should preside over a tribunal containing the presiding judge of the highest court of each of the member states. This tribunal would guarantee the conformity of the final text to the constitutional principles affirmed by the voters. This final judicial check should give the new constitutional treaty sufficient legitimacy to go into effect without another round of member-state ratifications. It will also reduce the risk of future legal challenges against the reconstructed EU before national courts.</p> <p>Europe is facing a historic choice. Political leaders can't guarantee a successful outcome. But they have the high responsibility to design a system that will pose the key questions in a manner allowing a fruitful and deliberate democratic decision. Our three-stage procedure could come to a conclusion within a reasonable time and provide a strong democratic foundation for a union equipped to confront the challenges of the 21st century.</p>",

She explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's extremely unfortunate that each of the parties conflate the need to cut expenditure with welfare reform policies. There is a real need for reform which is distinct from the need for a reduction in expenditure. Investment is needed to modernise the support services available to both unemployed people and people in low-paid employment.<br>In particular Community Links strongly believes that we need to invest in an improved, personalised jobcentre and employment support programmes. All of the political parties are shying away from the obvious \u2013 that support services still need reform. Yet we have no evidence from any of the parties of worked through polices on how to do this.<br>... Simply repeating the same cuts narrative for the next three years is unsustainable. The test for welfare reform at the 2015 election is innovative, solution-focused thinking \u2013 at the moment we are not getting this from any of the political parties.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 <strong>The Big Issue</strong>, which is marking its <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19784749\" title=\"\">21st anniversary</a>.

On his NHS Managers blog, he adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Big Issue started in 1991 when an estimated 2-3,000 people slept rough in London. Since then it has gone from strength to strength. Nationwide and acquired a cult status. And, it is a disgrace. For all its success, for all the hand-ups it has given, for all the great work it has done and is doing, the fact is, in June there were 5,678 people sleeping rough in London. An increase of 70%, up on last April. <br> It is a bloody outrage that after 21 years we haven't made the effort or had the wit, wisdom or money to end it.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 A fantastic suite of video resources on <strong>young people's mental health</strong> from NHS Leeds. The city's public health resource centre is running a campaign on young people and mental health throughout October and November. And a new website has been launched as part of the local Time to Change campaign.

  "<p>Britain is struggling to exit recession after growth in the vital services sector slowed in September.</p> <p>According to industry figures from Markit the headline business activity index dropped from 53.7 to 52.2 and employment fell, adding to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/01/uk-manufacturing-downturn-dashes-rebound\" title=\"\">gloomy surveys of the construction and manufacturing sectors</a> earlier in the week.</p> <p>Markit, which compiles a monthly index based on figures from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, said it was now clear that the bounce back from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/apr/29/cameron-double-dip-eurozone\" title=\"\">the slump in the first half of the year</a> was weaker than expected and could result in the UK economy growing by just 0.1% in the third quarter.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/01/businesses-optimism-prechristmas\" title=\"\">Hopes that the Queen's diamond jubilee and the \u00a39bn spent on the Olympics</a> would lift sales over the longer term, especially in the services sector, have largely been dashed as growth slows and the outlook, though robust with a growing order book, remain subdued.</p> <p>The Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which begins a two-day meeting on Wednesday, is expected to keep interest rates at 0.5% and maintain the stock of bonds in its quantitative easing programme at \u00a3375bn.</p> <p>However, most economists believe it is possible the lacklustre figures will persuade the MPC to add another \u00a350bn at its November meeting when the first estimate of the third quarter figures are available.</p> <p>Markit said the situation in the UK, though weak, contrasted with steep falls in France and Spain, where the equivalent indexes tumbled.</p> <p>The German services sector also shrank with worrying signs that a contraction over recent months has begun to feed into investment intentions. With margins squeezed, backlogs of work down for a seventh month and unemployment rising for the last six months, concerns that the German economy would be dragged down by the collapse in demand across the rest of the eurozone appears to be justified.</p> <p>A slump in France shocked economists, who said the fall from 49.2 in August to 45 in September revealed a severe fall in sales and investment. Anything above 50 indicates growth, while a figure below 50 indicates contraction.</p> <p>Spain, meanwhile, saw a fall to 40.2 as companies came to terms with predictions of a recession lasting until at least the end of next year.</p> <p>Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics said the UK is struggling to grow against a background of austerity at home and contraction across the eurozone.</p> <p>\"On the face of it, the headline balance looks consistent with quarterly growth in services output of only 0.2%. The drop in the balance suggests that temporary factors \u2013 including a gain to sectors like hotels and restaurants from the Olympics \u2013 were behind August's unexpected rise,\" he said.</p> <p>\"A weighted average of the three main activity balances of the manufacturing, construction and services surveys is now consistent with flat GDP in the third quarter. Overall, then, it is looking like the rebound in the economy expected in the third quarter is struggling to get any oomph behind it.\"</p> <p>The government is keen to spur growth after a fall in tax revenues and increase in spending on welfare and unemployment benefits hit the public finances. By some estimates the Treasury could miss its deficit reduction targets by as much as \u00a330bn by next April without a turnaround in the economy's fortunes.</p> <p>It will be of great concern that a rise in employment over the last year appears to have come to an end with services companies saying they can continue to grow, albeit at low levels, with fewer staff.</p> <p>Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the economy continued to move sideways after two years of virtually no growth.</p> <p>\"GDP is likely to have grown by perhaps 0.1% as modest growth of services activity was offset by a slight drop in construction sector output and a steeper decline in manufacturing.</p> <p>\"Official data are likely to show a stronger GDP rebound, reflecting a technical bounce-back from second quarter weakness arising from extra jubilee holidays, but the purchasing managers' index provides an insight into the underlying trend of the economy, and \u2013 like the British Chambers of Commerce survey \u2013 warns of near stagnation.\"</p> <p>He said the employment situation was also gloomy: \"With the mini-boom in the labour market having now come to an end, it seems inevitable that unemployment will start to rise again.</p> <p>\"Hopes are therefore pinned on the recent upturn in new orders being sufficiently strong and sustained to bring about improved growth of business activity and renewed hiring in coming months. New orders across all sectors grew at the fastest rate since May, though it is too early to say if this simply reflects a revival after an Olympics-related lull, as indicated by many companies.\"</p>",
  "<p>Labour would abolish the Independent Police Complaints Commission and replace it with a tougher and much more robust Police Standards Authority to restore public trust in the police, the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has promised.</p> <p>She said the need for reform had been demonstrated by the failures around the Hillsborough cover-up, the time it took to find out the truth about the death of Ian Tomlinson during the G20 protest, and the delays in getting new investigations under way into phone hacking and undercover policing.</p> <p>\"The IPCC wasn't able to sort out any of those cases,\" said Cooper, adding that its new chair, Anne Owers, had already warned about its lack of powers.</p> <p>She said the new body was urgently needed to ensure that isolated incidents were not allowed to damage the police's reputation.</p> <p>The move, which is also said to have the support of senior police officers, would see the creation of a Police Standards Authority with new powers to compel witnesses, launch its own investigations, hold public hearings and impose sanctions.</p> <p>\"Police officers need to know serious problems will be rooted out so they don't cast a shadow over everyone else,\" Cooper told the Labour conference in Manchester.</p> <p>\"Policing in a democracy needs proper checks and balances. Yet the system takes too long and the powers often aren't strong enough.\"</p> <p>The details of how the system will work are to be set out next spring by the independent commission on the future of policing, which was set up by Labour and is chaired by former Metropolitan police commissioner Lord Stevens.</p> <p>It is expected to include working much more closely with Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to avoid the current duplication of effort. The new body would also ensure a faster resolution of complaints, easier access and better support for those complaining, and an ability to deal with organisational as well as individual policing failings.</p> <p>The shadow home secretary also confirmed she would limit the role of private companies in policing and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/02/cooper-banking-reform-conference-speech\" title=\"\">introduce an Economic Crime Act </a>to target city fraud and money-laundering.</p> <p>She promised that Labour police and crime commissioners who are elected in November will \"halt this Tory rush to privatisation of our police\". She said Labour would continue to support public-private partnerships in policing, especially in areas such as new technology, but any such contracts would have to pass a series of tests, including on value for money, transparency, resilience and public trust.</p> <p>\"Let's be blunt. We don't want private companies patrolling the public streets of Britain,\" she said.</p> <p>The pledge to extend freedom of information (FoI) legislation to private companies by Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice secretary, will cover contracts to deliver public services, such as prisons, hospitals and schools. They will be required to share with the public information on contracts that are funded with public money.</p> <p>Khan said it was time to \"address this blind spot in our freedom of information laws\" and in contrast to Tony Blair's view in his memoirs that he had been an \"idiot\" to introduce FoI in 2000, the shadow justice secretary said he was proud of the achievement, however awkward it could prove to be.</p> <p>\"Not only will the next Labour government protect FoI, we will seek to extend it,\" Khan promised the conference. \"For the first time, FoI will cover the delivery of public services by private companies. This includes our prisons, our schools, and our health service. Public, private or voluntary, subjected to the same disinfecting transparency of FoI.\"</p> <p>On his justice brief, Khan also plans to create a dedicated minister for mental health within the Ministry of Justice and a women's justice board similar to the existing youth justice board. He also unveiled a new proposal to make it obligatory for the courts to consider the option of restorative justice as part of any sentence that is handed down.</p> <p>He said he hoped the women's justice board would emulate the success of the youth justice board in cutting the number of young people in custody by a quarter. A justice minister with responsibility for mental health would start to tackle the 70% of prisoners with two or more mental health problems.</p> <p>\"We've replaced the Victorian asylum with the Victorian prison,\" said Khan. \"Festering in prison with serious mental health problems that can and should be treated is morally wrong.\"</p>",
  "<p>Kevin Pietersen is expected to return to the England team for the four-Test tour of India in November after spending much of the next month flying back and forth from the Champions League Twenty20 competition in South Africa to hold clear-the-air meetings with the other players and the management as part of a \"reintegration process\" announced here on Wednesday.</p> <p>Andy Flower, the England team director who has been left as unimpressed as anyone by Pietersen's behaviour for much of the summer, has agreed to manage the process \u2013 and is thought to have decided that if the errant star is to be welcomed back into the fold, there is no point in delaying.</p> <p>Pietersen has therefore been offered a new 12-month central contract by the England and Wales Cricket Board, but only if the reintegration process is successful. Initially, the deal \u2013 which the ECB's chairman, Giles Clarke, said was signed only on Wednesday morning \u2013 runs for four months, to cover the Test series and two Twenty20 internationals in India before Christmas, and a one-day series in January.</p> <p>At a press conference in a function room at the Cinnamon Lakeside hotel \u2013 a location which had been kept secret until the last minute to limit the numbers in attendance \u2013 Pietersen apologised \"to my team-mates, all the England supporters and the ECB for the situation that has arisen over the last couple of months\".</p> <p>But crucially the ECB has accepted his insistence that he said \"nothing derogatory\" about the then England captain Andrew Strauss in the BlackBerry messages he sent to members of the South Africa team during last summer's series \u2013 which cannot be retrieved for proof one way or the other. Pietersen accepts they were \"provocative\", but stressed that \"at no time did I ever share tactical information\".</p> <p>Asked directly how the situation had spiralled out of control to such an extent that England went into the third Test against South Africa last August and then the ICC World Twenty20 without their best batsman, Pietersen said: \"Look, I'm here today to talk about going forward. For various reasons I don't want to go into other issues. It's just a case for us to look forward, to move forward and to not delve into what's gone on. It's a private matter.</p> <p>\"I'm fairly happy that we're able to move forward. It's been a horrible situation for all involved and I'm just glad that we're here today drawing a line under everything. Playing cricket for England is the pinnacle of any cricketer's career and I want an opportunity to do that again as soon as possible. Some of my proudest and best moments of my life have been in an England shirt and I want them to continue for as long as possible.</p> <p>\"I am entirely committed to completing the reintegration process we have agreed over the coming weeks, and resuming my England career in all formats hopefully until the World Cup in 2015 as long as my body allows. I want my son growing up seeing me playing for England, and I hope that one day he will put an England shirt on himself.\"</p> <p>After completing his media commitments at the World Twenty20 on Sunday, Pietersen will fly to South Africa to link up with Delhi Daredevils, his Indian Premier League employers, in a Champions League competition that also includes Yorkshire and Hampshire. But he has agreed to make a number of trips to England during windows in the tournament, which runs throughout October, to hold further meetings with Flower and senior players, including the new Test captain Alastair Cook, as part of the reintegration process.</p> <p>\"Time is beneficial to these types of matters,\" said Clarke. \"And in our society we believe that if an individual transgresses and the individual concerned recognises that, and apologises for what they may have caused to those involved, then it is important and a fabric of our society that that individual should be given a real opportunity to be reintegrated into our society. Kevin has apologised, and he has done further things today which are very important.</p> <p>Pietersen may not be able to join England's pre-tour training camp in Dubai because of his Delhi commitments, for which he has been given a no-objection certificate by the ECB as tangible evidence of the thaw in relations. In that case he would link up with the squad in Mumbai, where they play the first of three four-day preparation matches before the first Test begins in Ahmedabad on 15 November. He would be added to the squad rather than replacing one of the batsmen already selected, partly because Ian Bell is expected to miss the second Test when his wife is due to give birth.</p> <p>\"I want to play for England as soon as I can,\" Pietersen said. \"The process has started, it's started really well and I believe that all being well I'll be back in an England shirt as soon as possible. I really do believe that we have got a very good opportunity here for everything to be sorted. We're all human beings, we all make mistakes, I've apologised for them and it's time to look forward and hopefully have a successful time.\"</p>",

  "<p>One in five Royal Ulster Constabulary officers who retired under Northern Ireland's policing reforms have been rehired by the force set up to replace it, a report has found.</p> <p>The Police Service of Northern Ireland has taken back more than 1,000 ex-RUC officers on temporary contracts in a process that a financial watchdog has described as \"out of control\".</p> <p>The Audit Office found that almost 20% of the 5,000 RUC officers laid off under the reforms headed by Chris Patten were rehired.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/jan/19/justice.northernireland\" title=\"\">In 2001 the RUC was replaced by the PSNI</a> as part of a programme to recruit more Catholics into the police in Northern Ireland. Catholics now comprise 30% of the PSNI.</p> <p>In a report published on Wednesday, the Audit Office said the PSNI's recruitment policy had not always met the high standards of governance of public bodies. It also revealed that in 2004, a \u00a344m contract was awarded to a local company with no competitive tendering.</p> <p>The Sinn F\u00e9in junior minister Gerry Kelly said the report showed there was \"clearly an old boys' club\" operating inside the post-Patten police service.</p> <p>Kelly said: \"This is D-day for the chief constable. I certainly hope he is going to come out and try to defend this, especially when these facts are uncontested. What we need to know is what is going to be done to rectify what I would describe as corrupt practices.\"</p>",
  "<p>Over our hotel breakfast in Manchester on Wednesday a colleague suggested that Justine Greening, the transport secretary who presided over the now-defective west coast rail franchise award should be required to resign from the cabinet \u2013 she was moved to international development in last month's reshuffle \u2013 as a consequence of the debacle.</p> <p>Having heard her successor, the ex-miner Patrick McLoughlin, make a decent fist of an apology on Radio 4 \u2013 hours after officials revealed they had made errors in calculating rival bids from Virgin the FirstGroup \u2013 my initial reaction was, no, the secretary of state is not responsible for errors made by his/her accountants even though they are constitutionally required to take responsibility for all that goes on in the department.</p> <p>Then I remembered a relevant fact. It just so happens that by training and professional background <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Greenin\" title=\"\">Greening</a>, 42, is, yes, an accountant and finance manager whose background includes working for such giants of the trade as Pricewaterhouse Coopers, Big Pharma's GlaxoSmithKline and Centrica.</p> <p>Does that make a difference? It's hard to be sure before the full facts are known. Wednesday's retreat by the DfT comes ahead of Sir Richard Branson's high court bid to overturn what he rightly insisted \u2013 it hurts to type \"rightly\" \u2013 was a defective decision to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/15/virgin-trains-west-coast-mainline-firstgroup\" title=\"\">award Virgin's important Euston-to-Manchester-and-Scotland franchise</a> to the rival whose back-end-loaded bid, Branson has argued, was impossible to fund.</p> <p>But when Whitehall \u2013 cabinet secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood to the fore \u2013 conducts its inquest into the DfT's performance I'd say that the professional qualifications, as well as the judgment of the secretary of state might feature. And why not? We keep being told that too many politicians have never done \" a proper job\". Here is a minister who appears not to be open to that criticism, yet allows something serious \u2013 it may cost the taxpayer \u00a340m to put right \u2013 to happen on her watch.</p> <p>McLoughlin, a solid citizen, though his regime as chief whip was deemed too \"sergeant's mess\" for Andrew Mitchell, who took over, has instinctively shown better judgment in putting his hands up to admit error immediately and to do so in person. No swearing at coppers for him.</p> <p>In his combative Today programme interview with Evan Davis on Wednesday morning, Ed Miliband used an interesting word to describe the latest shambles to beset the government: a lack of \"grip\". A team that knows its direction of travel can overcome difficulties like this, the Labour leader said, but not if it's aimless. David Cameron once hugged huskies and hoodies but now seems uninterested in either, he added.</p> <p>Remember, unlike most recent Labour leaders, Miliband does have experience of government, both as a special adviser and, later, a minister in the cabinet office \u2013 heart of Whitehall \u2013 and at the department of energy and climate change. At Copenhagen, when the climate change summit was close to failure, he seized the moment to bang heads together and force a deal, I recall being told.</p> <p>As Tuesday's speech may have shown, more widely there may be depths to his leadership which voters had not previously spotted. We'll see. But delegates at Labour's conference \u2013 even old trade union sweats who don't much like boy politicians who never get their hands dirty \u2013 have been impressed.</p> <p>By the same token the west coast franchise shambles reinforces growing concern that the Tories did not do enough hard thinking before they returned to power. Nor did the Lib Dems, who did not expect to do so after 90 years of impotence. One old Whitehall official I bumped into on Tuesday at the conference \u2013 not a politico \u2013 made the point before the latest fiasco.</p> <p>That's why it's slipping on banana skins all the time. Public confidence, once lost, is hard to recover, as Tony Blair and Gordon Brown discovered. But not two years in, much later. As with much else \u2013 including the running of this important train line, the future is cloudy.</p>",

There are at least five more in Simon Swift's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/crime/9781907954214/the-casablanca-case\" title=\"\">The Casablanca Case</a> that are even worse. One more quick sample:</p> <blockquote> \"I felt the onset of my own climax, deep thrills running along the length of my penis, building rapidly to a heated bolt that sent spurt after spurt of ejaculate firing into Sarah Hill. <br> \"After that I must have fallen asleep ...\" </blockquote> <p>Suddenly, monasteries don't seem such a bad idea. Happily though, it isn't all sex in The Casablanca Case. There's also philosophy!</p> <blockquote> \"A lot of years had passed; a lot of life elapsed. It is often said that you should never go back, but sometimes there is no alternative. This was one of those times.\" </blockquote> <p>Rudimentary car mechanics!</p> <blockquote> \"You should turn off those lights, you're battery will be drained right down. Next time you try and start the car all you'll hear is a whining noise that grates right on your nerves.\" </blockquote> <p>And music!</p> <blockquote> \"Never falling prey to the onrush of commercialism and big city modernism, it resisted the casino and only rarely took gigs, jazz being an erstwhile companion.\" </blockquote> <p>That reference to jazz presumably comes in because this is a hard-boiled thriller set in 1950s America in a fictional town (Casablanca) that feels a lot like <a href=\"http://historylosangeles.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/philip-marlowes-los-angeles.html\" title=\"\">Philip Marlowe's Los Angeles</a>. Or at least, I think it is; there's room for confusion. This version of early-1950s America also features answering machines, bulletproof vests, colour photos as standard, cafeti\u00e8res of coffee, references to Joseph Heller's Catch-22 (published in 1961) and such typical US slang as: \"Cheers. You're looking a little better yourself, if you don't mind me saying, mate?\"</p> <p>It's pretty baffling \u2013 and not helped by a peculiar habit of Swift's which is probably best described by demonstration rather than lengthy explanation:</p> <blockquote> \"He showed me to the ice room, put the key in the correct drawer and left the room. For a moment I stood frozen to the spot.\" </blockquote> <blockquote> \"When he died, however, his bank account was overdrawn to the tune of $10000. One possible item of interest was a large withdrawal the week before he was shot. It was certainly worth following up.\" <br> </blockquote> <blockquote> \"'You can eat anything blue in the bar, but anything in black must be taken in the restaurant,'\" said a young black lady called Cherry.\" <br> </blockquote> <blockquote> \"The shooting pain in my head made me cry out in pain.\" <br> </blockquote> <p>If someone brandishes a gun, you can bet that they'll be firing off ideas any minute. If they're fishing, they'll be catching someone in their hook. If they're eating they'll be finding something hard to swallow. It adds a bit of (albeit unintentional) amusement, but, combined with some astonishing grammar, obscures Swift's meaning and intentions to the extent that getting through the book becomes a real battle.</p> <p>And that's a shame because, in spite of everything, there's some appeal to Swift's story of a weather-beaten detective returning to his old stomping ground to solve one last case \u2013 and discovering that the whole place has gone rancid in his absence. I wasn't just left puzzling over the events in the book because of the bewildering prose \u2013 there is a genuine sense of mystery.</p> <p>In the author's note in the back of the book it says that Swift has \"been compared to genre masters, Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett\". I'm guessing he's only been compared to them in the sense that people have pointed out that he's nothing like as good. Even so, there are the makings of a passable hard-boiled thriller here. Casablanca never seems real (and the name certainly doesn't help), but there's an intriguing seediness to the setting, with its sprawl of strip bars, its mafia-run local politics and cowed locals. When the lead character Errol Black is beaten up in a car park, he awakes to find that \"the cars were different. There must have been ten cars that were different to the ones before. Probably more than ten. They must all have seen me here in a crumpled heap. Like a drunken bum.\"</p> <p>Okay, it's not exactly Shakespeare, but it almost works, in context. There is enough ambiguity built in the story to leave me wondering exactly why no one helped poor old Black. What was wrong with this place? I didn't know \u2013 and that feeling of uncertainty kept me dutifully plodding through until the end.</p> <p>Mind you, I'd have thought far more of the book if I hadn't read the final 30 pages. The Casablanca Case might not have the worst opening of the year, but it definitely has the worst conclusion. Characters appear out of nowhere and disappear in confusion. Crucial events fly by in a few lines of flashback. Plot points aren't so much wrapped up as smothered and left to die. It was infuriating and absurd. After struggling along with Swift for so much of the marathon, it felt as if he'd reached the last mile and decided to dodge off to the pub instead of crossing the line. Okay, he was never going to win, but he could at least have pretended to care about finishing.</p> <p><strong>Next time: The vote!</strong></p>",
  "<p>As the teenager ejaculated, he became aware of two unfamiliar sounds. One was the very pleasing sound of his girlfriend gurgling with pleasure, her mouth full. He looked down and smiled to see her eyes widen momentarily and then swallow heavily. She looked up at him, flashing her teeth and beaming a beautiful smile.</p> <p>The second noise sounded like the gentle tapping of a drum.</p> <p>Moments before, as the jeep had ploughed through the sand dunes and come to a halt five hundred yards away, he had slid his fingers under her clothing, reaching for her breasts, caressing them tenderly through the bra. Not taking his mouth from hers for a moment, he reached for her belt, undoing it violently and slackening her jeans. She followed suit, both unaware they were not alone on the idyllic beach.</p> <p>The driver of the jeep, a tall heavyset man with ashen hair, killed the engine and stepped out onto the sand. His two passengers followed suit, covering the vehicle with a sandy tarpaulin. All three of the men were dressed in desert camouflage and carried silencer fitted .45's in shoulder holsters.</p> <p>The tricky part had been unclipping the bra, but soon enough his fingers passed over her naked breasts, fondling them each one in turn, pressing and pulling the erect nipples. Opening his hand so as to encompass every part he squeezed softly before lifting the clothing right up and putting his mouth where his hand had been.</p> <p>He spent time kissing her nipples, slowly revolving his tongue around them and then nibbling gently.</p> <p>The men edged up on the shoreline towards the small gathering of sleeping bags, which lay silently between the jeep and the young lovers. Their movements were covered by the noise of the sea. As they danced across the sand it all looked peaceful and calm. One of the men \u2013 a small, black man \u2013 crossed himself and pulled his weapon.</p> <p>She had pushed him onto his back, their mouths parting, and pulled at his jeans, carefully releasing one leg at a time. Her hand then moved upwards and closed around him. She kept her fingers there stroking faster to increase his excitement then slowing into a pleasurable rhythm. Suddenly, she released him and moved down slowly, kissing first his chest, his belly-button, and then lower until he filled her mouth. His head slammed back against the sand as her<br>tongue went to work; licking every inch of his erection from top to bottom, side to side. She held it with one hand and sucked the tip, at first softly, but harder and harder making him cry out in pleasure. He just lay back gyrating in rhythm, letting the pleasure flood over him as he fucked her mouth beautifully.</p> <p>Two of the figures in the sleeping bags sat up, hearing the climatic cry of the teenagers. One said something in Spanish and they both laughed. As one cupped his hands around a cigarette the other flared a lighter but suddenly his head slumped forward. She still held him in her hand as the men reloaded their<br>silenced pistols twenty yards away.</p> <p>Now he took over sliding his hand down to her stomach, pushing her jeans right down and tossing them on the sandy beach. Her muscles quivered and tightened at his touch, and he steadily reached lower. His hand travelled down between her thighs. Again he heard the tap tapping \u2026</p> <p>She moaned as his middle finger entered, exploring her moist, warm inside. He moved his hand in a soft, languid motion, gradually increasing the speed of his strokes, pushing a second finger in. He felt elated, he had finally got there.</p> <p>The thudding of the three silenced guns, firing over and over again spoilt the perfection of their lovemaking. The muzzle flare lit up the whole beach as the sleeping bags were torn apart by round after round.</p> <p>A minute after starting, the shooting stopped and quiet now descended on the beach.</p> <p>\"Are they all dead?\" asked the black man.</p> <p>\"Oh yes,\" said driver, as he kicked the bloodied remains of the six sleepers.</p> <p>\"Make sure,\" said the tall man, who lit up a cigarette as the other two loaded fresh clips and shot the corpses point blank in the face.</p> <p>They waited.</p> <p>Not daring to let go, she clung on to his penis but as she slowly resurfaced to kiss his smiling face, it was no longer smiling. There was a dark, bloody hole in the centre of his forehead and he slumped backwards, carrying her with him.</p> <p>The sun first appeared just after five. The trawler emerged not long after that.</p> <p>\"Two hundred yards,\" said the driver, quietly.</p> <p>The others nodded.</p> <p>The trawler got nearer and the hum of the engine got louder. At fifty yards the black man walked over to the bloody sleeping bags and waved his arms at the boat.</p> <p>There were two men on the deck of the boat. They both died waving back at the shore. The force of the bullets sent them crashing backwards into the railings, where their bloody bodies lay still.</p> <p>Twenty minutes later the jeep was heading away from the coast, bouncing off the sand dunes a little easier in the daylight.</p> <p>Trussed up in the back, lay the girl.</p> <p>The small trawler exploded several miles from the coast \u2026</p>",
  "<p>If Steven Fletcher's recall by Scotland is hardly a surprise, the real mystery surrounds his shortage of summer-time suitors. Admittedly Aston Villa expressed mild interest in prising the centre-forward away from Wolves but it was really only Sunderland who set their heart on Fletcher. Why?</p> <p>Was it snobbery? Relegated from the Premier League with Burnley and then Wolves, the former Hibs striker had perhaps been tarred by association. Then there was the fact that many of his goals were registered with his head \u2013 perhaps that distracted managers from the compelling statistic that he scored nearly once every two games. For someone playing in struggling sides that represents a stunning ratio.</p> <p>In the end, Martin O'Neill persuaded Sunderland's owner, Ellis Short, to part with, depending who you believe, either \u00a312m or \u00a314m. Since then Fletcher has scored Sunderland's five Premier League goals of the new campaign \u2013 with his feet.</p> <p>Last Saturday, he scored the winner against Wigan at the Stadium of Light with Sunderland's only chance, but such clinical proficiency is augmented by an all-round excellence. Apart from being decent in the air and possessing stellar positional sense, Fletcher has shone on the ground. His adhesive control and ability to manoeuvre the ball in the tightest of spots with defenders breathing down his neck has extricated O'Neill's team from several awkward situations.</p> <p>Small wonder Sunderland's manager feels entitled to joke that he was a bargain \u2013 although compared with the \u00a335m Liverpool paid Newcastle for Andy Carroll Fletcher certainly looks one \u2013 but the interesting thing is that the Northern Irishman is not remotely startled by the 25-year-old's impact. \"No, I'm not surprised,\" says O'Neill. \"I watched Steven quite a lot last season and I knew he was a very good player.\"</p> <p>The puzzle is why Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Brendan Rodgers, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas and friends did not join their Sunderland counterpart in pursuing him. True, Fletcher came with a bit of \"a British premium\" but if he carries on like this he will soon double his value.</p> <p>Indeed, he would probably have scored more elsewhere as, with Adam Johnson injured of late, James McClean suffering a spot of \"second-season syndrome\" and St\u00e9phane Sess\u00e8gnon a pale shadow of his normal self, Sunderland have not yet clicked into a proper chance-creating groove.</p> <p>Perhaps Fletcher's trouble is that his 6ft 1in frame, and a face that looks much older than his 25 years, have conspired to see him branded, erroneously, \"old-fashioned\", \"a throwback\" or \"retro\". Possibly being seen as Scottish rather than French, Spanish or even English did not help either. Or maybe people wondered about the bloody-minded streak that manifested itself in February 2011 when he informed the Scotland camp by text message that he did not want to be selected to play Northern Ireland.</p> <p>By May this year, Craig Levein, Scotland's coach, had declared: \"There's no going back on this. That's it. Finished. Done.\" Now Levein is describing Fletcher's recall as a \"no-brainer\".</p> <p>A third party \u2013 O'Neill? \u2013 contacted Scotland's coach to inform him Fletcher was desperate to return to the fold. It was not long before Levein \"bit the bullet\", chose to ignore the public criticism from Fletcher which had preceded the whole business and picked up the phone. Pride swallowed, he then invited the man who has scored five goals in four Premier League games this season back for his country's vital World Cup qualifiers against Wales and Belgium.</p> <p>The two cases remain very different but Levein must have felt a touch like Roberto Mancini deciding to perform a volte-face on Carlos T\u00e9vez in order to win last season's title. Although whether even Fletcher can save Levein's side from further ignominy remains debatable.</p> <p>Roy Hodgson, meanwhile, may be cursing the Shrewsbury-born Fletcher's decision to represent Scotland, the place of his mother's birth, and the country in which he lived for some time following the death of his English father. Steven Fletcher would surely have made a far from shabby England No9.</p>",
  "<p>Ed Miliband has insisted his decision to draw on his north London comprehensive education background in his \"one nation\" speech was to explain what makes him \"tick\", rather than playing the class card.</p> <p>The Labour leader did the round of radio and television studios to reinforce the key messages from a well-received <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/02/ed-miliband-one-nation-speech1\" title=\"\">keynote speech delivered at the annual party conference in Manchester on Tuesday</a>, saying he felt he needed to explain to the public where he came from and what experiences formed his political beliefs.</p> <p>In his speech, Miliband prefaced the positioning of his party on the one nation beliefs articulated by the 19th-century Tory prime minister Benjamin Disraeli with an autobiographical section outlining his background as the son of Jewish immigrants and his time at Haverstock school, north London, which will be repeated in a party political broadcast on Wednesday night.</p> <p>The Labour leader, who is due to return to the conference platform on Wednesday to take questions from Labour activists, insisted he was not trying to highlight the contrast to the privileged roots of the Eton-educated prime minister, David Cameron, but to explain what shaped the thinking behind a speech that mentioned \"one nation\" 46 times.</p> <p>\"It's not to do with a class act, it's much more to do with trying to explain who I am,\" he told ITV DayBreak. \"I think one of the things people have been rightly saying to me is: as somebody who wants to be prime minister, we need to know more about you, what makes you tick.</p> <p>\"And you know, when I say, let's not leave 50% of young people out who aren't going to university \u2013 let's give them proper apprenticeships and vocational skills. I think if the young people I was at school [with] \u2013 I did go to university \u2013 but I think about them when I hear Michael Gove saying let's go back to two types of academic exams, 16 O-levels and CSEs, which were around when I was there \u2013 I think about all the young people who were written off when I was at school, so in a way, I can explain the way I approach things on the basis of who I am and what my background is.\"</p> <p>Miliband, who used his speech to accuse Cameron of \"handing a cheque\" to himself and members of his cabinet by cutting the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p next April, insisted he personally would not benefit, though he declined to declare his own total worth.</p> <p>He refused to set out his own tax plans ahead of the election, but repeated that were Labour to form a government tomorrow, it would reverse the coalition's decision on the top tax rate.</p> <p>He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: \"I think the right thing to do is to set out your tax plans at the time of the election when you know your overall circumstances, but look, I've given a pretty clear indication of what we would do tomorrow if we were in government.\"</p> <p>Miliband said a Labour government would be forced to make \"difficult decisions\" but said it would ensure that those with the broadest shoulders bore the greatest burden.</p> <p>\"Which is why I wouldn't be cutting taxes for those earning over \u00a31m as this government is doing, raising taxes on everyone else \u2013 cost of \u00a33bn pounds by the way \u2013 and cutting services for people.</p> <p>\"Now that is a very clear difference of approach from this government.\"</p> <p>He said his one nation message signalled his desire since being elected leader to move on from New Labour, which he said was too timid about standing up to the City, without returning to old Labour, which was about protecting sectional interest.</p> <p>Miliband spelled out his vision by comparing his approach to welfare with that of the government's \"two nations\" approach, in which the vast majority of people desperate to find work were portrayed as \"lazy scroungers\" against a backdrop of hardening public opinion.</p> <p>\"I think there is a minority of people on welfare who should be working and aren't but I do think the tone and nature of a government really matters. I meet people up and down the country who are decent people who are seeking to find work, young people, some people with disabilities, who are banging their head against a brick wall trying to find work, and all they hear is that they are lazy scroungers.\"</p> <p>He added: \"It's not just a tone thing, but the tone matters. Let me be clear about this. I believe in an active government, I think every young person should be guaranteed a job after a year out of work. We have shown how we can do that, not with a government that walks away as this government does, but at the same time young people have a responsibility to take that work. Here's the interesting thing. The government can't do either of those things \u2013 they are not giving these young people jobs after a year, nor are they requiring them after a year.\"</p>",

  "<p>I cannot say I know Marjorie Scardino well. And I have little knowledge of her role as Pearson's chief executive. But in my informal talks with her she has made one thing abundantly clear: she has an abiding passion for newspapers. </p> <p>I am not sure whether that personal preference played a part in the fate of the Financial Times. I like to think it did because, throughout her 15 years at Pearson's helm, there have been continual rumours about the paper being sold off.</p> <p>It was never going to be an option while she was in charge because she simply loved the paper, its journalism and its ethos. She ensured that it had a safe haven inside Pearson.</p> <p>Of course, the FT and the group of which it is part, needed to justify itself by turning a profit, which it certainly has done in recent years. (And the paper alone makes money, incidentally.)</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/oct/03/pearson-marjorie-scardino-step-down\">Now that she is to leave</a> questions about its future will undoubtedly be raised once again. For the moment, let's leave that speculation to one side and pay tribute to Scardino's faith in, and support for, the Financial Times.</p> <p>It springs from her own journalistic background. Marjorie Morris, as she then was, dropped out of law school at George Washington University to become a journalist with the Associated Press in Charleston, West Virginia.</p> <p>After rising to desk editor she met a rookie reporter called Albert Scardino and romance blossomed. They married in San Francisco where Marjorie returned to university and duly gained her law degree.</p> <p>After a couple of years, the couple moved to Savannah, Georgia, where she became a partner in a law firm. And it was there in 1978 that they founded their own newspaper: the Georgia Gazette. </p> <p>The paper, characterised as a \"feisty alternative weekly\", won editorial plaudits (including a Pulitzer) for its campaigning journalism. But it failed financially and closed in 1985, thus providing a valuable, if painful, lesson for Marjorie about the publishing business. </p> <p>Albert joined the New York Times \u2013 covering media, I think \u2013 while Marjorie managed, against the odds, to land the job of managing editor of the north American division of The Economist magazine. </p> <p>She oversaw the doubling of its US circulation and was rewarded for her success in 1992 by becoming chief executive of the Economist Group, which brought her to London.</p> <p>Within five years she was given the infinitely more complex task of running Pearson's global empire. I ought also to mention that Albert was an executive editor here at The Guardian for a while and maintains a close interest in media affairs (see <a href=\"http://www.port-magazine.com/commentary/lessons-from-the-leveson-inquiry/\">his recent piece on the Leveson inquiry</a>).</p> <p>It's fair to say that despite the wide-ranging concerns at Pearson that have taken her away from newspapers, Marjorie still has a beating journalistic heart. The FT was always safe in her hands. Will the new Pearson chief, John Fallon, feel the same way?</p>",
  "<p>Hamas security forces are routinely subjecting Palestinian detainees in Gaza to torture and abuse, according to a report by Human Rights Watch, which says three men have been executed on the basis of \"confessions\" apparently obtained under coercion.</p> <p>The report cites serious abuses such as arbitrary arrest, denial of access to lawyers and the use of torture during interrogations.</p> <p>\"After five years of Hamas rule in Gaza, its criminal justice system reeks of injustice, routinely violates detainees' rights, and grants immunity to abusive security services,\" said Joe Stork of HRW. \"Hamas should stop the kinds of abuses that Egyptians, Syrians and others in the region have risked their lives to bring to an end.\"</p> <p>The report, <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/node/110517\" title=\"\">Abusive System: Criminal Justice in Gaza</a>, calls for urgent reforms, including a moratorium on the death penalty. It cites the case of Abdel Karim Shrair, who, according to family and lawyers, was tortured under interrogation before being executed by firing squad in May 2011 after \"confessing\" to collaborating with Israel.</p> <p>Fourteen Palestinians have been executed since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007. This week, the European Union condemned death sentences handed down last month to two men in Gaza, one for murder and the second for collaboration.</p> <p>The EU \"considers capital punishment to be cruel and inhuman, failing to provide deterrence to criminal behaviour, and representing an unacceptable denial of human dignity and integrity\", it said in a statement.</p> <p>HRWatch accused Hamas of failing to investigate alleged cases of torture and abuse, and of granting impunity from prosecution to security service officials.</p> <p>It said \"intra-Palestinian political rivalry [between Hamas and Fatah] remains a significant factor behind many Hamas abuses against detainees in Gaza\".</p> <p>The Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority in the West Bank also \"arrests and detains Palestinians arbitrarily, including Hamas members or sympathisers, and similarly subjects detainees to torture and abuse\", the report said.</p>",
  "<p>Guardian News and Media's (GNM) environmental performance reporting aims to cover all the relevant impacts within the boundaries we can control or influence and while we cannot cover everything, we are continuing to expand our knowledge and data.</p> <p>Given that we have limited resources, we are focusing most of our effort on where we have the largest impacts and control:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Carbon footprint</strong> Emission sources of carbon from across the business and supply chain</li> <li><strong>Resource footprint</strong> Consumption and use of natural and processed resources, including paper, operational consumables and materials</li> <li><strong>Waste footprint</strong> Sources of waste generation across the business</li> </ul> <p>In line with our carbon positive commitment, we have further expanded our measurement to include our digital operations, including data centres.</p> <p>Beyond this, we are now measuring the emissions from our New York and Manchester offices and have also improved the collection of data relating to business travel.</p> <p>We have also improved other data, including print site waste and ink consumption.</p> <h2><strong>Carbon Footprint</strong> </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397112813\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/17/1347873150771/LOV2012_Ops_Footprint1-001.png\" alt=\"LOV2012_Ops_Footprint1\" width=\"460\" height=\"461\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LOV2012_Ops_Footprint1</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the financial year ending March 2012, GNM's Carbon Footprint emissions were 32,850tCO2e, a 2% increase on a comparative basis with the previous year.</p> <p>The emissions increase is due to a switch in purchasing to a recycled British mill that uses more energy, although we still maintained our paper emission target of 370kg per tonne of paper. </p> <p>The continuing expansion of our carbon reporting through our supply chain and operations means that the scope of the footprint has changed from what was reported last year. </p> <p>Our carbon footprint has not been significantly changed. Although, what we are now able to offer is greater detail and we can, for example, show that our own servers represent 2% of emissions. </p> <p>We have been able to estimate, for the first time, the carbon footprint of www.guardian.co.uk. For 2011/2012 this was in the magnitude of 10,000 tonnes CO2e - approximately a third of our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainability/sustainability-report-2012-digital-carbon-footprint\">current GNM footprint</a>.</p> <p>The model used to calculate the emissions is still going through academic peer review and we are currently analysing how best to manage the uncertainty in the data and how to incorporate it into the overall footprint. </p> <p><strong>Reducing Emissions </strong></p> <p>One thing is certain is that it becomes increasingly difficult over time to continue reducing emissions.</p> <p>It is therefore important to look at our performance over time and in fact GNM has achieved a 25% reduction since our base year of 2009/10.</p> <p>Looking through a slightly different lens, we reduced carbon intensity in the last financial year by 1% to 20.7 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per employee, based on our wider boundary.</p> <p>In terms of our directly controlled operations, including offices, data centres, print sites and business travel, we saved 3% carbon in 2011/12 compared with the same period the previous year. This was achieved through a combination of investment, improved efficiency, and environmental management and reduced operations. This has been part been of a continued effort to reduce our directly controlled emissions which have reduced by 31% since our base line of 2008/9.</p> <p>Our two Guardian Print Centres in Manchester and London achieved reductions of 9% in total emissions. In addition, emissions per tonne of newsprint used fell to 116kgCO2e in 2011/12 compared to 122kgCO2e. </p> <p>We are looking to develop better metrics to measure efficiency and this likely to include per page emissions and energy base load. The base load is the consumption of electricity which occurs regardless of how or what we print, for example associated with lighting and heating.</p> <p>Business travel emissions rose by 42% or 320tCO2e in the last financial year. Air travel rose by 52% or 240tCO2e and train travel by 32%. This is the second year which has seen an increase in air travel.</p> <p>This increase is predominately due to better data collection, so it is not possible to give accurate comparative data. In December this year we put into place a mandate and a new travel management company. This has lead to a significant improvement in the collection of travel emission data compared with the previous year. </p> <p>While budget cuts mean that we are monitoring travel more carefully, there has been a sharp increase in flights between London and New York as a result of the strengthening of our presence in the United States. </p> <h2><strong>Resource Footprint</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397112814\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/17/1347873226100/LOV2012_Ops_Footprint3-001.png\" alt=\"LOV2012_Ops_Footprint3\" width=\"460\" height=\"230\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LOV2012_Ops_Footprint3</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paper consumption is not only our number one carbon source but also our largest known direct impact on the environment. </p> <p>When purchasing paper we aim to balance price, quality, security of delivery, carbon emissions and sustainable paper sourcing. GNM refers to sustainable paper sourcing as paper fibre which, is from a recycled or certified (i.e. <a href=\"http://www.fsc.org/\">Forest Stewardship Council</a> (FSC) or <a href=\"http://www.pefc.co.uk/\">Programme for the Endorsement of Forest</a> Certification (PEFC) source.</p> <p>In the last financial year 98% of the newsprint and 94% of magazine grade paper used for the Guardian and Observer was either recycled or used certified virgin fibre. </p> <p>Newsprint recycled levels fell to 81% in 2012, but are still above our 80% target. However, this is compensated by an increase of 6% in certified virgin sources to 17%.</p> <p>For virgin source magazine grade paper 94% is certified with only 6% remaining uncertified. In 2010/11 14% of virgin magazine grade paper was uncertified. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397112815\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/17/1347873201320/LOV2012_Ops_Footprint2-001.png\" alt=\"LOV2012_Ops_Footprint2\" width=\"460\" height=\"250\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LOV2012_Ops_Footprint2</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reduced sales and pagination, as well as a lower weight of paper and efforts to reduce paper wastage, meant that GNM saw a 5% reduction in newsprint consumption in 2011/12 to 44,570t. </p> <p>Water is a precious resource and we are conscious that we must continue to monitor and manage our usage. This is why in the current financial year we are looking at the opportunities for collecting water consumption data from our paper suppliers. In areas of the business where we do monitor water, we are managing to reduce it.</p> <p>Our two print plants achieved actual water reductions of almost 16%, or 1.5 million litres, during the last financial year. This was mainly due to improved controls, water recycling, cleaning processes and observation of water use to detect and fix leaks. </p> <p>Ink consumption across both presses was reduced by 14%, or 169,900 kg. This was due to efficiency measures and reduced printing. </p> <p>We endeavour to minimise the environmental impacts of our ink. We have substituted harmful solvents through the switch to water-based inks and we can be sure that none of the coloured pigments contain heavy metals such as cadmium.</p> <p>Our inks currently contain a small amount of petroleum-based product but the percentage is less than 2.5% and is diluted during the printing process. Other chemicals used in the printing process are diluted in water up to 98%. Therefore used newspapers are totally safe to compost.</p> <h2><strong>Waste Footprint</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397112816\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/17/1347873247953/LOV2012_Ops_Footprint4-001.png\" alt=\"LOV2012_Ops_Footprint4\" width=\"460\" height=\"461\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LOV2012_Ops_Footprint4</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> While office waste has a relatively low environmental impact compared with our other activities, it is an issue with high visibility among staff. In fact, the issue had previously come up repeatedly in workshops held with departments across GNM to look at sustainability objectives.</p> <p>Last year we launched a Love Your Waste campaign to reduce contamination and improve recycling as well as improving bins and signage. As a result, we increased our office waste recycling to 78%, including composting in the financial year ending March 2012. All waste is managed according to current legislation and even though we do recycle WEEE - waste electrical and electronics equipment (i.e computers, mobile phones), batteries, toner cartridges and CDs this data was not available for inclusion in the waste figures for this reporting year.</p> <p>We also managed a reduction in total waste volumes. No waste now goes directly to landfill and waste to incineration fell by over 40 tonnes, although in the last three months of the financial year, non-recycled waste had been increasing month on month. In addition, the volume of total paper waste continues to increase and further investigation is still required to understand why this is happening.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397112817\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/17/1347873282953/LOV2012_Ops_Footprint5-001.png\" alt=\"LOV2012_Ops_Footprint5\" width=\"460\" height=\"250\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LOV2012_Ops_Footprint5</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With a focus on segregation and better resource management, total waste at the print sites fell by 13% or 192,000kgs. London achieved a 17% reduction in total waste, while both print sites saw improvement in recycling by 4% Manchester now 84% and London 78%. Both sites also reduced hazardous waste this includes solvents, plate developers and oil filters.</p> <p>Paper waste continues to be a focal point, given that it is a valuable resource and recycling it therefore generates an income for the sites. The quality or the purity of the paper also affects the price therefore paper is segregated in three main ways:</p> <p>White - paper not printed on, lost due to splicing errors and left on cores<br>Printed - paper lost in press start up and errors in printing <br>Brown - packaging paper used to protect the newsprint when delivered to site</p> <p>For example, at our Manchester Site 61% of waste by weight is printed paper waste.</p>",

She carries a pass entitling her to free travel, as she suffers from epilepsy. But this, the bus driver declares, is just a \"piss-take\". She must pay up or leave.</p> <p>When it comes to rank unreasonableness, he's not alone. In recent years, we've had a model refused entry for <a href=\"http://www.metro.co.uk/news/33047-model-thrown-off-bus-for-being-too-tall\" title=\"\">being too tall</a>, pensioners wrongly <a href=\"http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/3757345.Apology_after_OAPs_ordered__off_their_bus/\" title=\"\">ordered off</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2233825/Lad-of-9-thrown-off-busover-5p.html\" title=\"\">nine-year-old</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/bullyboy-inspectors-throw-girl-14-off-bus-in-tears-for-the-sake-of-30p-7905889.html\" title=\"\">14-year-old</a> ejected for being a few pence short. In separate incidents, two mums were kicked off: one, who was heavily pregnant, for being accompanied by <a href=\"http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2011/01/13/pregnant-mother-thrown-off-bus-91466-27977343/\" title=\"\">a noisy child</a>, the other <a href=\"http://www.metro.co.uk/news/814837-breastfeeding-mother-thrown-off-bus\" title=\"\">for breastfeeding</a>. Most awfully, a 22-year-old law student was beaten and raped in Nottingham after <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2156000/Women-raped-Joseph-Moran-thrown-bus-20p-short-fare.html\" title=\"\">finding herself 20p short</a> of the full fare and attempting to walk home at night. Is this some sort of epidemic? And how come so many of these cases feature some of society's most vulnerable?</p> <p>Dig deeper and you'll find a more complex picture. There's reporting bias, with the worst cases making headlines (instances of drunken lads being sent packing scarcely excite a tremor in the news-o-meter, though those that respond by attacking the bus driver sometimes do). There's no doubt that there are individuals who have clearly overstepped the mark, like the drunken woman who subjected a fellow <a href=\"http://www.lbc.co.uk/watch-racist-woman-thrown-off-london-bus-48552\" title=\"\">passenger to racist abuse</a>, and attacked him. And then there are the downright bizarre: a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bradford/7204543.stm\" title=\"\">goth couple</a> were turfed off because the woman was being led on a lead by her male partner. There's much to argue there, from the rights of those living alternative lifestyles to do so in public, to the \"degradation\" of the woman involved. According to the bus operator, this was a safety issue.</p> <p>So let's try for some perspective. As a very nice man from <a href=\"http://www.firstgroup.com/\" title=\"\">First Group</a> reminded me via email, buses are the most heavily used mode of public transport in the UK; at almost 5 billion journeys per year, shouldn't finding so few incidents be cause for celebration? Besides, there's no standard industry approach, but some of the bigger bus operators have rules that supposedly govern how vulnerable individuals must be treated, including an obligation not to order individuals off a bus if danger might ensue. So is there really a problem?</p> <p>An experience of my own with a \"grumpy\" driver brought the issue home. A minor falling out \u2013 I suggested he was taking a roundabout route so as not to arrive at his destination too early \u2013 was cut short with a threat to throw off his bus anyone who publicly disagreed with him. I felt intimidated, silenced. Unsure of my rights, I had no idea whether I could be left stranded just for disagreeing with the \"captain\" of the bus.</p> <p>Not that asserting said rights would necessarily help, as disabled activist Ray Bellisario has discovered. After difficulties with a number of drivers, Bellisario took the unusual step of acquainting himself with the rule book regarding his rights on buses. It hasn't helped. He has still been refused admission or received objections from bus drivers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jul/10/fighting-right-travel-buses\" title=\"\">28 times in 18 months</a>. The drivers were often clearly aware that they were breaking the rules. A few passengers might get uppity, but sadly the majority \u2013 those who are vulnerable and are used to the steady drip of institutional discrimination \u2013 just put up and shut up.</p> <p>In Bellisario's case, the rule book failed to help. So what hope for those travelling with smaller operators \u2013 or even some larger operators: train companies running those most curious of beasts, the replacement bus? Take First Capital Connect: as a train company it has exemplary procedures for putting people off trains. When it comes to buses, it plays pass the responsibility parcel. Asked what guidelines were issued to sub-contracting companies running alternative travel arrangements, a spokesman explained: \"All professional bus and coach drivers are fully aware of their responsibilities to their passengers and, as the only member of staff on board, have to exercise their own judgment and discretion.\" Or in other words, passengers must take pot luck as to what codes and practices are in operation at any given moment.</p> <p>So while I don't quite believe there is an epidemic, it would not surprise me if press reports were just the tip of the iceberg, with large numbers of vulnerable people just going along for the ride, in every sense of the word, because they have no idea what their rights are.</p> <p>That won't be solved by \"professional standards\" or rule books stashed away in control rooms where no one can see them. It calls for a culture change: bus operators getting out and publicising standards and proactively engaging vulnerable groups. Because only when drivers and passengers alike are fully aware of what to expect from a bus service is that service likely to improve and the ejections, the suffering in silence, become a thing of the past.</p>",
  "<p>This year, fees rise in many universities to the maximum of \u00a39,000. This sum will be paid by the government direct to your university in the form of a loan, which you will repay, plus interest, once you've graduated and are earning more than \u00a321,000 a year.</p> <p>\"It may sound daunting,\" says Annie Christodoulidis, a second-year history student at York university, \"but it's not crippling.\" Her views are echoed by Sussex university financial assistance officer Jon Dale: \"The repayment terms have never been better.\" But, he explains, it is important that students are speedy with their application to Student Finance England (responsible for administering the loans): \"For those starting courses in 2013, applications can go in from the beginning of 2013. It's a great deal simpler than in the past. All that is required is for students to provide their total parental income and the relevant national insurance number(s). Everything is now checked automatically.\"</p> <h2><strong>Living costs</strong></h2> <p>Your living costs as a student will be in the region of \u00a37,000 a year (more in London), although some universities suggest a minimum budget of \u00a38,000. A maintenance loan, paid directly into your bank account and repayable under the same conditions as the fee loan, will cover part of your living costs. The size of your loan depends on your total household income, but all full-time students qualify for \u00a33,575 a year.</p> <p>Students from a household where the total income is less than \u00a342,601 also qualify for a non-repayable maintenance grant on a sliding scale. For families with incomes below \u00a325,000 a year, a student is eligible for the full grant of \u00a33,250. This reduces to \u00a3500 for a household income of \u00a342,600.</p> <p>Many students face a shortfall. This might be met through a combination of family support, university bursary, part-time job, or bank overdraft. National scholarships are also available to students with a family income of \u00a325,000 or less, and give you the first year of tuition free of fees. Most universities also run their own array of small bursary schemes: check their websites for details of how to apply.</p> <p>\"When it comes to grants,\" says Jon Dale, \"it is important that students shop around, because on top of the government money available to students from families with incomes below \u00a342,600, universities offer some generous hardship funds, bursaries and scholarships.</p> <p>Managing your budget as a student is a vital skill and it's not easy, especially when you first move away from home and become financially independent. Ann Musk, at the student wellbeing service at Newcastle University, says: \"If there's one piece of advice I'd want every student to know if they hit financial difficulties, it is: get in touch with student services.

  "<p>The future running of one of Britain's most prestigious and lucrative rail services, the west coast mainline, was thrown wide open after the transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, announced that the competition had been cancelled following the discovery of significant technical flaws in the franchise process.</p> <p>The news could potentially put other franchises due to be settled in the next two years on hold and will raise questions over the whole system, with unions and Labour considering calling for renationalisation.</p> <p>The shock move means that the Department for Transport will no longer be awarding a franchise contract when Virgin's current one expires on 9 December, and will not contest the judicial review that Sir Richard Branson's firm sought in the high court.</p> <p>In a climbdown that appears to vindicate Virgin's angry reaction to losing the franchise on 15 August, the DfT has indicated key staff will be suspended, apparently for incorrectly calculating the risk involved in the winning bid.</p> <p>A spokesman for FirstGroup, which had been awarded the franchise, said: \"We are extremely disappointed to learn this news and await the outcome of the DfT's inquiries. The DfT have made it clear to us that we are in no way at fault, having followed the due process correctly. We submitted a strong bid, in good faith and in strict accordance with the DfT's terms.</p> <p>\"Our bid would have delivered a better deal for west coast passengers, the taxpayer and an appropriate return for shareholders.\"</p> <p>The DfT said it had uncovered serious flaws in the procurement process. FirstGroup's winning bid, with payments heavily loaded towards the back end of the 13-year franchise, offered premiums far in excess of the bond it was offering as security. Virgin had described the winning bid as a recipe for bankruptcy.</p> <p>An investigation will be conducted by the department, which is likely to speed ahead with plans to pass the running of the west coast line into the hands of state-owned company Directly Operated Railways to ensure that train services continue uninterrupted.</p> <p>McLoughlin said passengers would continue to be served by the same trains and frontline staff. The transport secretary has ordered two independent reviews to be undertaken urgently: the first into what went wrong with the West Coast competition and the lessons to be learned, the second into the wider DfT rail franchise programme.</p> <p>McLoughlin has asked officials to examine the options for the operation of the service after 9 December taking into account procurement and competition law. Meanwhile he has frozen all other outstanding franchise competitions \u2013 Great Western, Essex Thameside and Thameslink \u2013 pending the independent reviews, which the Dft hopes will ensure future competitions are robust.</p> <p>McLoughlin said: \"I have had to cancel the competition for the running of the West Coast franchise because of deeply regrettable and completely unacceptable mistakes made by my department in the way it managed the process.</p> <p>\"A detailed examination by my officials into what happened has revealed these flaws and means it is no longer possible to award a new franchise on the basis of the competition that was held.</p> <p>\"I have ordered two independent reviews to look urgently and thoroughly into the matter so that we know what exactly happened and how we can make sure our rail franchise programme is fit for purpose.\"</p> <p>He added: \"West coast passengers can rest assured that while we seek urgently to resolve the future arrangements the trains that run now will continue to run, with the same drivers, the same staff and timetables as planned. The tickets that people have booked will continue to be valid and passengers will be able to make their journeys as planned.\"</p> <p>The most senior civil servant at the department, Philip Rutnam, said: \"The errors exposed by our investigation are deeply concerning. They show a lack of good process and a lack of proper quality assurance.</p> <p>\"I am determined to identify exactly what went wrong and why, and to put these things right so that we never find ourselves in this position again.\"</p> <p>The first independent review will be overseen by Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw and former PricewaterhouseCoopers strategy chairman Ed Smith, to work out what went wrong with the award of the west coast franchise. The second review, to be undertaken by Eurostar chairman Richard Brown, will examine the wider rail franchising programme and look in detail at whether changes are needed to the way risk is assessed and to the bidding and evaluation processes, and at how to get the other franchise competitions back on track.</p> <p>The Dft said it found evidence of significant flaws as its officials were gathering evidence in preparation for legal proceedings.</p> <p>These flaws stem from the way the level of risk in the bids was evaluated. Mistakes were made in the way in which inflation and passenger numbers were taken into account, and how much money bidders were then asked to guarantee as a result.</p> <p>The department said it could not be confident that these flaws would not have changed the outcome of the competition or that any of the four bidders would not have chosen to submit different offers.</p> <p>The four bidding companies \u2013 First, Virgin, Keolis-SNCF and Abellio \u2013 will all be compensated, and have been assured a fresh competition will be started.</p>",
  "<p>Studying social work changed my life in many positive ways and I often think back to the stresses and pressure I felt while I was studying. If I were starting now, there's some advice I'd share with that younger me.</p> <h2><strong>Seek opportunities, don't wait for them </strong></h2> <p>Discover relevant literature: books and journals, blog posts and magazines, newspaper articles, Twitter and Facebook groups. Use the medium which is best suited to you. Try to find what interests you and don't wait for information to be presented to you \u2013 that way it will be more interesting. It can be a real change moving from further education to higher education as the emphasis moves to self-direction. Be interested and be curious.</p> <p>Follow policy developments before being told about them. Be the person that keeps other people informed. Ignite discussions around policies and politics outside work. Social work cannot be detached from politics and an interest in current social policy.</p> <h2><strong>Build strong relationships with your peers</strong></h2> <p>I am still close to people I trained with on my social work course. We've travelled down very different professional paths and had very different lives along the way, but the support we've given each other through treading a common path has been a valuable strength through the good, bad and wobbly periods. Peer support is crucial and those on the outside will find it hard to understand the pressure you are under while you are training.</p> <h2><strong>Be the social worker you would want to have </strong></h2> <p>Never see the user \u2013 whatever area you are working in \u2013 as 'the other'. It could be you, your child, your parent, your friend. You might not see that now. Think about the interactions you have and how you would change them if you were receiving them. Sometimes you will be hated and resented. It's the role and isn't personal. You won't often be thanked but you will be paid.</p> <p>If you leave at the end of the working day you know you did your best and treated people as you would want to be treated, the job becomes infinitely more rewarding.</p> <h2><strong>Reflect </strong></h2> <p>This is a word you'll hear a lot. It took me a while to understand it but when it clicked, finally, everything made and makes better sense.</p> <p>As Alexander Pope wisely said: \"Know then thyself, presume not God to scan, The proper study of Mankind is Man.\"</p> <p>Know yourself. Know what makes you react the way you do. Know how you respond and what experiences in your life have led you to those responses. Know what you might have to do to change those reactions. Learn from them.</p> <p>Use the experiences and knowledge you have \u2013 and despite what you may think, you do have skills, knowledge and experience, whatever your background. Self-examination tempers responses and allows them to be learning opportunities. When you do 'get' it, things will become easier. Reflection builds resilience when you know what your own strengths and weaknesses are.</p> <h2><strong>Remember that feeling of powerlessness when you are in position of power</strong></h2> <p>When I was a student, particularly on placement, I lacked confidence in my actions. I wasn't a 'real' social worker or feel I was in a 'powerful' position. However, even as a student with those doubts, I went into the homes of others and carried out reviews, fed the information back to my team and helped make decisions about them. I did have power in respect to the people I was allocated to work with.</p> <p>I felt my practice educator held all the cards. She was supportive but it could have been different. When struggling, I'd think of those feelings of powerlessness and what they felt like. Think how the users who come into contact with you, both as a social work student and eventually as a practitioner, feel. Power is something that can take a while to appreciate \u2013 particularly if you have it. It needs to be acknowledged.</p> <h2><strong>Distractions </strong></h2> <p>Sometimes distractions, hobbies, external interests are vital. One of the things that kept me going through the very intense course and my career, post qualification, was having interests unrelated to work. These have allowed me to grow in different ways and get away from it from time to time. Don't neglect other interests/people/friends. You are likely to need them later.</p> <p><strong><em>Why not join our community?

  "<h2><strong>Managing time</strong></h2> <p><strong>Alys Young, professor of social work, University of Manchester: </strong>Take some time at the start of the course to reflect and acknowledge the passion and conviction that has brought you to a career in social work. When the course gets challenging and you feel at your lowest ebb, reminding yourself why you want to join this amazing profession will get you through.</p> <p><strong>Alison Reeve, social worker, Wrexham: </strong>Time management skills are imperative especially when on placement. Having to juggle cases as well as time to complete assignments and portfolios can be difficult. Don't feel that you are on your own and have to do it all in one day \u2013 you don't. Make a list and prioritise the most to the least important tasks. If you feel bogged down, talk to your practice assessor and ask them for help and support. Always communicate with tutors and practice assessors: they have been there and understand how difficult it can be.</p> <p><strong>Gillian Alcantara, community support worker:</strong> I learnt the hard way that you need to buy a wall planner and mark every date that something is due in. Then work out how long you have to do each piece of work, finish your placement and add a few extra days that you may have to write off due to hangovers!</p> <h2><strong>Doing your research</strong></h2> <p><strong>Danielle Alder, social work masters student: </strong>Research into people's real experiences of the profession, through blogs and Twitter, is incredibly useful \u2013 above and beyond text book stuff. It helps to make it all seem more real and gives you more of an insight into the options available to you.</p> <h2><strong>Relationships with others</strong></h2> <p><strong>Jane Evans, parenting specialist: </strong>A good habit to establish early on is to regularly check in with yourself emotionally and physically and to find someone at work, or among those close to you, who is a good listener and empathetic because unloading and sounding off is good for your mental health. Especially if it ends with a good, long, hard belly laugh!</p> <p><strong>Rebecca Joy Novell, newly qualified social worker:</strong> Engage in peer supervision. My course friend and I would meet up three times a week for tea to discuss placements, essays, social justice ... everything. We questioned, challenged and supported each other, enabling us to refine ourselves in to the newly qualified social workers we wanted to be.</p> <h2><strong>Ask questions!</strong></h2> <p><strong>Helen Bonnick, practice educator with University of East London: </strong>Practice saying: \"Of course, that makes perfect sense now; I was just making it too complicated.\" It's really important to ask questions when you don't understand something, but people don't because they think it must be really obvious and they're afraid of looking silly.</p> <h2><strong>Be flexible about placements</strong></h2> <p><strong>Mark Doel, professor at the centre for health and social care research, Sheffield Hallam University: </strong>Your practice placements may seem a while off, but it's worth thinking about them now. Be open-minded and flexible. You might have come into social work because you want to work with a particular service user group, but remember that social work is much bigger than any one speciality. My last placement (a long time ago!) was in an unpromising setting, but I had a fantastic time and learned such a lot. It entailed a bus, a ferry and a train to get to it, but the experience was well worth the travelling. Learning is about your own mindset as much as it the setting, so open yourself up to new and unplanned experiences and you'll remember your placements all your professional life.</p> <h2><strong>Managing money</strong></h2> <p><strong>Bill Mumford, chief executive of the charity MacIntyre: </strong>Try and get a part-time social care job; I worked some evenings as a youth leader. It helped pay the bills and caused me to ponder on the disconnection between theory and reality. (More than 30 years on, I am still pondering the same thing!)</p> <h2><strong>Approaches</strong></h2> <p><strong>Louise O'Neill, newly qualified social worker:</strong> Try and remain open minded throughout the course. Not only in respect to which service-user group you hope to work with eventually, but in respect of the values you hold as a practitioner. The experiences students will have on placement will challenge their beliefs every day, and I believe that the ability to remain open minded will enable them to develop into flexible practitioners who are not afraid to question certain courses of actions and theories of human behaviour.</p> <p><strong>Mark Hardy, director of undergraduate studies in social work, York University: </strong>Social work is a serious business. Working constructively with people, some of whom may well not be receptive to your efforts, can be difficult and demoralising. Perhaps the most important quality you will require if you are to be as effective as you can be will be ... a sense of humour. There probably won't be a module on this on your course, so it's down to you how you cultivate this. But however you do it, make sure you keep smiling. Every day, every week, every term. Social work is a serious business, so its important you don't take it \u2013 or yourself \u2013 too seriously.</p> <h2><strong>And Sue Knox, social worker, on everything else</strong></h2> <p>\u2022 Always answer the essay question: stick the question on top of your laptop and keep looking at it.</p> <p>\u2022 You are not so different from all the thousands of students before; if they could do it, so can you.</p> <p>\u2022 Subscribe to British Journal of Social Work and get your mate to subscribe to the practice journal from the British Association of Social Work. Best money you will ever spend: you can read them in bed and it saves on library fines.</p> <p>\u2022 On placement, put your ego to one side and take on any task, however menial: it will open the door to new experiences.</p> <p>\u2022 Remember many practice assessors haven't got degrees and can be a bit challenged by you. Be self deprecating, humorous and supportive to them. Part of social work is getting on with your co-workers, so it's good practice. Remember, even with years of experience, having a student watch what you do makes most professionals a bit self-conscious, so put them at their ease.</p> <p>\u2022 You only need to read the summary, the conclusion and the index of any document.</p> <p>\u2022 Some concepts and theories of social work are very complex. Sometimes you are just never going to get your head around them. So stick to the ones that resonate with you.</p> <p><strong><em>Why not join our community?

  "<p>Men, it's said, like their sex fast and frequently, and don't care if they never know the recipient's face or name. But women want emotions, and lots of stroking: and so we have an age-old problem that even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/naomi-wolf\" title=\"\">Naomi Wolf</a> and her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/07/vagina-new-biography-naomi-wolf-review\" title=\"\">\"goddess\"</a> have so far failed to solve. Helen DeWitt, though, has a modest idea. Why not pay a few women a lot of money to remove their bottom clothes and stick their legs through a hatch in the wall of the disabled toilets, so top earners can discharge themselves without risk of being seen? The women can spend the time reading Proust in French while saving up to go to Harvard Law School. The men return to their desks five minutes later, refocused and refreshed.</p> <p>Helen DeWitt published her first novel, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/22/fiction.reviews\" title=\"\"><em>The Last Samurai</em></a>, in 2000. It's a wonderful book, dearly loved by everybody who reads it: a mother, a son, a search for a father figure, what's not to like about that? The follow-up, however, is just as weird and narrow and mechanistic as it sounds \u2013 no wonder it has taken a decade to find a publisher. Though it's also a tightly disciplined and extremely funny satire on office politics, sexual politics, American politics, and the art of positive thinking, culminating with a sad, dry attack on the very basis of constitutional democracy: \"Some of those laws were written by people like Joe, and the rest were written by people trying to clean up after people like Joe. No wonder they left a lot to be desired.\"</p> <p>The spine of the story deals with Joe, a failed Electrolux salesman and a monster of the can-do attitude. \"When you're in sales you've always got one thing to sell and that's yourself,\" says Joe, never one to miss a chance for clich\u00e9. All's not well, though, in the vacuum cleaning trade, and recently Joe has been expending more and more time on his favourite masturbation scenarios, most of which involve fully clothed, unruffled women getting \"the old Triple Jeopardy\", \"the full-service 24-hour Revco from the rear\". One day, he has a Eureka moment while eating his Special K. He buys a good suit, he rents an office in a smart location. And so the Lightning Rods employment agency is born.</p> <p>A man, Joe calculates, thinks of sex every five seconds: more, if he's the sort of high-testosterone alpha no successful business can do without. Obviously you can't have these people harassing their female colleagues. So what are they supposed to do? The women Joe hires are highly skilled secretaries, to all appearances just like normal temps. Only the Lightning Rods themselves know about the messages that pop up on their computers when one of the company's higher earners finds himself a bit frustrated. Neither provider nor client knows anything about the other, because of the outsourcing and the toilet wall.</p> <p>\"Ramifications\" follow, in strict logical order. Chris in Marketing, for example, is dubious to begin with: \"The disability facility lacked a lot of the features you typically looked for in sex \u2013 tits, for example.\" But then, he finds himself \u2013 for the first time ever \u2013 liking a date for her personality, instead of just obsessing about sex. An \"issue\" comes up when Joe turns down an African American applicant, because her legs are too easy to identify \u2013 the applicant threatens him with the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and a compromise is reached. The fastidious Renee is totally \"disgusted\" by the LR job description, then gazes at a dog turd and reflects: \"At the end of the day you're just talking about pieces of the planet.\" Renee goes on to become a star LR employee, and later, a Justice of the US Supreme Court.</p> <p>Between <em>The Last Samurai</em> and <em>Lightning Rods</em>, DeWitt self-published another novel, <em>Your Name Here</em>, co-authored with Ilya Gridneff, sold in pdf format off a Paypal button on her website. Readers who only know her first book will be astonished by the range and brilliance of her interests: languages, law, sabermetrics, movies such as Mel Brooks's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/110036/producers\" title=\"\"><em>The Producers</em></a>, apparently the inspiration behind the current book. You can see that influence, I guess, in the screwball plot and the joyous larding on of the clich\u00e9s: \"The way the guinea pigs saw it was, you don't expect Vitamin C to taste like an orange.\" \"The toilet was another kettle of fish.\"</p> <p>But there's something deeper going on as well. \"Most people don't know what they're doing half the time \u2026 What Renee realised was that the same thing applied to the country as a whole. It was set up from scratch by people who managed to overlook minor details like slavery and a whole sex.\" As a judge, Renee works on sorting out the US constitution, which of course is great. But what have Joe and people like him been up to in the meantime? And which sort of people do you tend to get more of in positions of power, the Joes or the Renees?</p>",
  "<p>Do you choose the advisers you work with based on their specialist knowledge of your sector? If you do, you may not be benefiting from other information that you may need in order to make the most of opportunities.</p> <p>As the founder of one of a small but growing number of companies that work with charities, social enterprises and businesses to improve their income generation, we regularly come across perceptions that people have about different types of organisation. For example, people who think that profit-making companies are \"bad\", or that starting a charity and keeping it going is \"easy\". We meet people who think that money donated to a charity should only be spent on causes, with nothing left for core costs, and those who believe that private-sector sales people are manipulative, rich and uncaring.</p> <p>The arrival of new structures like Community Interest Companies (CICs) and the emergence of a new generation of profit-making companies with a genuine commitment to social value has started to blur the boundaries between the for, not-for and not-just-for profits. We are forced to accept that, as ever, the reality is far more complicated than we'd like. But we risk missing a trick: in all the rhetoric about cross-sector working, partnerships and knowledge transfer we are still failing to learn from organisations with different approaches and structures to our own. Our experience suggests that this failing is at its most acute in the area of income generation.</p> <p>The way in which organisations generate income, whether through fundraising, sales, tendering or donation needs closer examination because:</p> <p>\u2022 In times of economic pressure we all need to innovate to survive, and it's important that muttering that \"times are tough\" doesn't distract us from concentrating and controlling our own future.</p> <p>\u2022 We are too slow to use the latest evidence and research to inform how we approach income generation.</p> <p>\u2022 Significant failings in both the for-profit and the not-for-profit sector have damaged customer and stakeholder trust; we all need to understand the whole picture to improve our lot.</p> <p>Below are three of the many areas where we see more similarities than division between the private and third sectors.</p> <h2><strong>Super-doers </strong></h2> <p>Whatever type of organisation you run, the chances are that too few people within your team are responsible for generating your income. If this problem is acute, of course you need to focus on cultivating more of these engaged, energetic and vital individuals. But, that isn't an easy task, so while you are working on it, what can you do to increase the sense of accountability across the whole team?</p> <p>Creating a sense that a few people are responsible for the dirty business of bringing in money increases the pressure on those who do it, and decreases the chances that the rest of the team will identify and respond appropriately to opportunities. After all, if your job is to deliver services, not to secure contracts, why would you stay behind after a big meeting to discuss what else is going on in a key partner organisation?</p> <h2><strong>Unintended consequences</strong></h2> <p>When things aren't headed in the right direction we often turn to planning, and from there to goal and incentive setting. From the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/sep/27/ppi-complaints-double\" title=\"\">mis-selling of PPI</a> and the recent controversy <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/voluntary-sector-network/2012/sep/28/defence-street-fundraising\" title=\"\">surrounding street fundraisers</a> we have compelling evidence on the risks, and unintended consequences of setting incentives. This view is supported by Goals Gone Wild: The Systematic Side Effects of Over-Prescribing Goal Setting, a paper by Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez et al, in which they outline a number of risks associated with the over use of goals to control behaviours, including an increased risk of unethical behaviour.</p> <h2><strong>Not valuing trust</strong></h2> <p>Social media has increased the level of engagement that individuals expect with organisations, and the speed at which good and bad news travels. There isn't an easy route here. You need to engage and use the technology \u2013 the risk of people saying bad things about you in the Twittersphere doesn't disappear just because you aren't there \u2013 and by not engaging you may miss amazing opportunities.</p> <p>The values which govern how you operate face-to-face need to apply in all arenas. Manipulation, bad mouthing, high pressure techniques and unguarded comments aren't acceptable anywhere, and will soon come back to bite you. See this example from <a href=\"link:http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/gallery/2012/jul/19/greenpeace-shell- arcticready- in-pictures#/?picture=\" 393319863&amp;index=\"0&quot;&quot;\" title=\"\">Greenpeace</a> of how quickly a trusted brand can undo years of reputation building.</p> <p>There are so many areas where all organisations need to change and improve that this list could go on and on. Times are tough, but the response isn't for us all to stick with what we've always done. And if private and voluntary sector organisations both need to move on, why can't we move forward together?<br><em><br>Isla Wilson is a director of <a href=\"http://rubystarassociates.co.uk/\">Ruby Star Associates </a> which specialises in sales, selling, training, marketing, business + social enterprise.
