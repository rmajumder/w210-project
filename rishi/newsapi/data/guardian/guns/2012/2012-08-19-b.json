  "<p>A new best practice regime for street fundraisers comes into effect today, after a year-long trial and review process. The regime comprises new rules for fundraisers, developed by the <a href=\"http://www.pfra.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Public Fundraising Regulatory Association</a>, and a penalty points and fines process for fundraising organisations that transgress the rules.</p> <p>The new chief executive of the Public Fundraising Regulatory Association, Sally de la Bedoyere said it is \"vitally important that fundraisers work to the highest possible standards in order to maintain the confidence of the public, media, and central and local government. These new rules complement the Institute of Fundraising's code of practice on face-to-face fundraising, which sets the benchmarks for best practice across all forms of fundraising. This is a prime example of how sector bodies can co-operate to drive up standards and improve compliance with the codes.\"</p> <p>The PFRA's rules for street fundraisers \u2013 contained in the <a href=\"http://www.pfra.org.uk/professional_standards/best_practice/pfra_rule_book_for_street_f2f/\" title=\"\">PFRA Rule Book (Street F2F)</a> \u2013 were developed following a request from the<a href=\"http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/home/\" title=\"\"> Institute of Fundraising </a>to provide extra guidance to the Institute's code of practice on face-to-face fundraising. For instance, while the code of practice says only that fundraisers must never \"deliberately confuse or obstruct the public\", the Rule Book defines obstruction as: \"Any deliberate action that causes a person to involuntarily stop or suddenly change direction in order to get past the fundraiser and continue their journey.\"</p> <p>Ceri Edwards, director of policy and communications at the Institute of Fundraising, says: \"Every contribution to raising professional standards in fundraising is welcome and we look forward to working with the PFRA to make sure face-to-face fundraising remains a sustainable long-term option for charity fundraisers.\"</p> <p>The rule book contains a series of best practice rules that enhance the Institute of Fundraising's code of practice on face-to-face activity and provide extra guidance on interpreting the IoF's rules. For example, we introduced the three-step rule, intended to stop fundraisers following members of the public, and produced guidance on 'obstruction' and 'immediate termination' \u2013 two terms left undefined in the code of practice. Both the rule book and the penalty points system were announced in August 2011 and have been on trial since then. PFRA conducted a full review after six months. A full version of the rule can be read<a href=\"http://www.pfra.org.uk/professional_standards/best_practice/pfra_rule_book_for_street_f2f/\" title=\"\"> here </a>.</p> <h2>Key points</h2> <p>The rule book contains a series of rules which carry penalty points of 20, 50 or 100 points, which are awarded against a fundraising organisation \u2013 whether they are agencies or charities running in-house teams \u2013 each time they breach one of these rules. When a fundraising organisation's points tally exceeds 1,000 points, that total is converted to a monetary fine on the basis of \u00a31 per point. Further breaches are invoiced, at \u00a31 per point each month. The slate is wiped clean for each fundraising organisation at the end of the financial year, when the 1,000-point threshold is reintroduced. All money levied though the fines system will be ring-fenced for improving PFRA's compliance function.</p> <h2>Penalty points</h2> <p>The rule book contains a series of rules which carry penalty points of 20, 50 or 100 points, which are awarded against a fundraising organisation \u2013 whether they are agencies or charities running in-house teams \u2013 each time they breach one of these rules.

All money levied though the fines system will be ring-fenced for improving PFRA's compliance function.</p> <h2>New rules</h2> <p>\u2022 A new rule (C10) stipulates that fundraisers must make the solicitation statement, which is legally-required under s67 of the Charities Act 2006. The penalty for failure to make the legally- required disclosure is 100 points.</p> <p>\u2022 A further rule stipulates that before fundraising organisations embark on a campaign they ought to submit their proposed solicitation statement to the PFRA so it can check its compliance with the law (rule O1; penalty 100 points).</p> <p>\u2022 Fundraisers should not approach members of the public who are 'on duty' (C6; 20 points), such as newspaper vendors or tour guides, nor members of the public who are seated (C7; 20 points).</p> <p>\u2022 Fundraisers should not stand within 3 metres of a shop doorway, pedestrian crossing, cashpoint or station entrance (C8; 50 points). The previous version of the rule book only prohibited fundraisers from standing within 3 metres of a cashpoint.</p> <p>\u2022 Bags should not be left unattended on a public highway (C9; 100 points).</p> <p>\u2022 Team leaders should carry information about the sites they work on, such as accurate site delineations (O4; 20 points).</p> <p>\u2022 Fundraisers should not work on sites that have already been booked by another fundraising organisation (O5; 100 points)</p> <p>\u2022 No rules were dropped from the rule book following the review.</p> <h2>Amended rules</h2> <p>The wording of the three-step rule (C5) has been changed to say that fundraisers ought to take no more than three steps alongside a member of the public as they attempt to engage them. Previously, the three-step rule stipulated that fundraisers could take up to three steps towards a person, three steps backwards and then three steps alongside a person. The new version of the rule allows fundraisers to take any number of steps towards a person providing that, as soon as they have engaged that person, they don't follow them for more than three steps.</p> <h2>Penalty point changes</h2> <p>The penalties for the following rules have been increased from 50 points to 100 points.</p> <p>\u2022 Best behaviour (rule C1)</p> <p>\u2022 Deliberate obstruction (C2)</p> <p>\u2022 Immediate termination (C3)</p> <p>\u2022 Managing vulnerability (C4)</p> <p>\u2022 Poaching fundraising staff (O8)</p> <p>The penalty for the ID badges not being visible from a distance (rule C13) has been increased from 20 points to 50 points. The penalty for fundraisers working on a site for which there is not authorisation (rule O2) remains at 100 points but has been expanded and strengthened. No penalties were reduced following the review.</p> <p><em>David Mills is Editor of the Guardian Voluntary Sector Network.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>A statue of Sir Bobby Robson stands at the main entrance to Newcastle United's home and, before matches, fans frequently take turns to be photographed in front of it. When a short detour before kick-off permitted Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas the chance to admire a sculpture that was erected last spring, memories must have flooded back. \"I like it,\" said Tottenham's new manager.</p> <p>As a teenager growing up in an apartment block in northern Portugal he could not have wished for a better neighbour than the late Newcastle manager. Impressed by Villas-Boas's tactical deconstruction of his Porto side \u2013 something contained in a document slipped beneath Robson's front door \u2013 the former England coach famously began mentoring the 16-year-old, offering him work analysing games and players.</p> <p>The ensuing 18 years have brought Villas-Boas unprecedented managerial glory at Porto, ignominy at Chelsea and now the real promise of a renaissance with Tottenham. After dominating the first half, Spurs narrowly lost this match due to an amalgam of characteristically clever second-half tweaking on Alan Pardew's part, Hatem Ben Arfa's talent- laden intelligence, Demba Ba's opportunism and Villa-Boas's current shortage of established strikers.</p> <p>\"It's a bitter-sweet situation,\" said the Spurs manager. \"We must improve but it was a good performance. We had the most chances and were the superior team.\" Featuring the impressive Sandro synchronising smoothly with Jake Livermore in central midfield, the first half suggested Tottenham's new-look 4-2-3-1 formation will cause opponents numerous problems.</p> <p>Despite Spurs's eventual defeat all the indications are that little should be read into a subsequently deleted tweet from the omitted Tom Huddlestone, which apparently criticised Harry Redknapp's successor. \"Respect needs earning before being given. Fact,\" it read, but the overriding message from the visiting camp is that the Spurs players like Villas-Boas and enjoy his varied, innovative coaching. Perhaps Huddlestone is simply too one-paced?</p> <p>Reverting to an essentially 4-4-2 guise designed to afford Demba Ba a central attacking role alongside Papiss Ciss\u00e9, Newcastle initially appeared clunkily one dimensional and over-reliant on an ineffective barrage of long balls. If Jermain Defoe and Gareth Bale had not hit a post and bar respectively, Tottenham would have been comfortably ahead at the interval.</p> <p>Reprieved, Pardew used the break extremely well and Newcastle re-emerged in a more fluid, broadly 4-3-3 configuration. Facilitated by Ba's relocation to the left, it was designed not only to promote shorter, smarter passing but to maximise Ben Arfa's menace. When Kyle Walker inadvertently headed Danny Simpson's cross into Ba's path, the striker swivelled seamlessly before sending the ball curling imperiously towards the top corner.</p> <p>It was Ba's first goal for seven months. After scoring 16 times before New Year last season, his shooting boots proved defective when occupying a similar left-wing role supporting Ciss\u00e9 last spring. But Ba believes he has now found a way to marry playing wide with goals.</p> <p>\"I've spent a lot of time analysing games on my own and seeing what I had to do to change the bad stuff,\" he said.</p> <p>After Pardew's mindless shove on an assistant referee over a disputed throw-in got him banished to the stands he watched Defoe equalise adroitly.</p> <p>But if Ben Arfa's diligence in tracking back suggested he is now a player who can safely be delegated defensive responsibility, attacking improvisation remains the France international's forte. In drawing Sandro and Livermore into the fouls which brought them first-half, style-cramping bookings, he had prised the game open and now enticed Lennon into bringing him down in the area after running into the narrow gap between the winger and Rafael van der Vaart.</p> <p>Ba was left looking startled when Ben Arfa seized the ball before sending Brad Friedel the wrong way from the penalty spot. \"I'm very happy for Hatem,\" said Ba. \"But I'll take the next one. I'll get there first next time.\"</p> <p>If Robson might have smiled at that, he would surely have endorsed Pardew's view of his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9. \"I'm pleased to see AVB back,\" said Newcastle's manager. \"We've got to know each other fairly well and I'm convinced he's going to do a super job at Tottenham.\"</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Hatem Ben Arfa (Newcastle United)</p>",
  "<p>Wikipedia lists him as Glenville Adam J le Fondre, born in Stockport of French ancestry and a fervent admirer of Eric Cantona. Reading fans know him as plain Adam Le Fondre and his team-mates call him just \"Alf\", after his initials, or elongate it to \"Alfie\". Whatever name is the preferred choice, it is likely that observers of the Premier League will be hearing it many more times this season.</p> <p>Le Fondre may have plied his trade mostly in the nether regions of professional football, with Stockport County, Rochdale and Rotherham United before moving to Reading a year ago, but 132 career goals prior to a drab seasonal opener against Stoke City suggested a certain happy knack as he approached his Premier League debut. With time almost up, No133 duly arrived, a drilled penalty after Dean Whitehead had upended Garath McCleary for which the Stoke midfielder was sent off.</p> <p>No pressure on Le Fondre? Well, with Reading back in the top flight after a four-year absence and staring at a home defeat against an ordinary Stoke side first time out, the spot kick did have a nerve-jangling element to it. And with Reading having missed a remarkable six penalties as they won the Championship last season, the psychological stakes were raised further.</p> <p>No problems, though. \"Maybe my heart was beating a bit fast,\" Le Fondre said. \"It took a little while to move all the players out of the box but I always had in mind where it was going and just focused on that. I've been dying to get a penalty since I joined but I've never been on the pitch to take one. I was the designated taker but I nearly forgot.\"</p> <p>Le Fondre has not forgotten his humble roots and will be reminded even more starkly of where he came from when Reading play Chelsea, the Champions League winners, at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night. \"It's what dreams are made of,\" he said. \"When you're a little boy and you think that you want to play in the top division and it doesn't pan out like that, you've just got to work harder. And that's what I've done. It's a long way from Spotland and the Don Valley Stadium.\"</p> <p>Stoke had gone ahead when the Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici allowed a tame shot from Michael Kightly to squirm through his grasp \u2013 \"I don't make those mistakes in training, let alone in games,\" the Reading goalkeeper said \u2013 but thereafter showed a bewildering lack of ambition to build on their lead.</p> <p>Could Michael Owen, who has been linked to Stoke, make a difference? Not so, according to Tony Pulis, their manager. \"People have kept talking about Michael,\" he said. \"We've got five strikers so we can't bring any more in.\"</p> <p>Michael James Owen. Now there, in his pomp, was a striker. Glenville Adam J. le Fondre still has a way to go yet.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Adam Le Fondre (Reading)</p>",
  "<p>The government's plan to establish a new generation of secret courts has sparked fresh controversy after it emerged that the fact that a hearing is to be held behind closed doors may itself be kept secret.</p> <p>During House of Lords debates, it was disclosed that a government application for a court to sit in secret \u2013 with the public, the media and even the claimant and their lawyers being excluded \u2013 could itself remain completely secret under the proposals.</p> <p>The admission drew immediate comparisons with so-called <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13473070\" title=\"\">superinjunctions</a>, which not only prevent the media from publishing information said to be confidential or private, but also ban publication of the fact that the injunction exists.</p> <p>The secrecy proposals, contained in the government's <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/justiceandsecurity.html\" title=\"\">justice and security bill</a>, allow government ministers to apply for special courtroom measures known as closed material procedure (CMP) whenever the government or its intelligence agencies are being sued in the UK courts.</p> <p>Ministers say the measures are needed to prevent intelligence material handed over by friendly governments being disclosed in open court.</p> <p>Many lawyers and human rights activists deny that such wide-ranging secrecy is necessary, and point out that once the bill becomes law, the public will be prevented from learning about the UK government's involvement in human rights abuses, such as the torture of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/12/mi5-mi6-rendition-secrecy\" title=\"\">Binyam Mohamed</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/15/rendition-jack-straw-martin-ubanga\" title=\"\">decision to consign British citizens to Guant\u00e1namo</a>, and the existence of the last Labour <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/aug/04/uk-allowed-interrogate-tortured-prisoners\" title=\"\">government's secret torture policy</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.tinastowell.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Lady Stowell of Beeston</a>, a government whip in the Lords, <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/120723-0001.htm?utm_source=Press+mailing+list&amp;utm_campaign=b16185cb6f-2012_08_17_secret_secret_courts&amp;utm_medium=email\" title=\"\">told peers</a>: \"As to whether the press should be notified at the point of application for a CMP, it may well be informed, but it will not be informed if the issue is related to national security.\"</p> <p>Asked by <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/charles-falconer/26675\" title=\"\">Lord Falconer of Thoroton</a>, the former lord chancellor, for clarification that it was the government's intention \"that there will be certain circumstances when even the fact of an application \u2026 is to be kept secret\", Stowell replied that not all CMP applications would necessarily be kept secret, but that \"if the knowledge that the application has been made could give rise to concern about national security, it would not be made public.\"</p> <p>The admission was described by Reprieve, the legal charity that helped represent Mohamed when he brought proceedings against the British government, as a \"deeply disturbing development\".</p> <p>Clare Algar, its executive director, said: \"This is reminiscent of superinjunctions in its excessive secrecy. Yet instead of merely covering up footballers' indiscretions, these courts could be used to sweep serious state human rights abuses, such as torture, under the carpet. If this bill passes, it will badly damage centuries of British legal tradition and make it far harder for the citizen to hold the state to account.\"</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice said those making allegations against the government, and MI5 or MI6, would still be able to do so in public, and their claims were more likely to result in trials \u2013 albeit partly in secret \u2013 rather than being settled out of court. The media would then be able to report on the courts' decisions.</p> <p>A spokesman said: \"Nothing currently heard in open will go into closed session. These measures have no impact on claims that the government, or the security and intelligence agencies, have been directly involved in wrongdoing.\"</p>",
  "<p>The creation of \"mini-jobs\", which allow people to take on work without paying tax or national insurance, is being considered by the Treasury as one of a package of measures to make it easier to create employment.</p> <p>The idea \u2013 being promoted by some influential Conservative MPs \u2013 is modelled on a <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=10&amp;ved=0CGMQFjAJ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fdse.univr.it%2Fespe%2Fdocuments%2FPapers%2FD%2F5%2FD5_4.pdf&amp;ei=EuAwUOOyOqq40QWcl4HgDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNE9X6_E4fIChRGg2zaCrKGwgKtc4w&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">scheme in Germany</a>, in which employees can earn up to \u20ac400 a month (about \u00a3314) without giving up any of their salary, and employers pay only a flat rate to cover pensions, social insurance and wage taxes, making administration simpler.</p> <p>People can hold several mini-jobs up to the \u20ac400 a month tax-free limit, with the only impact on their income being the reduction of unemployment benefit over a certain threshold. Between \u20ac400 and \u20ac800, workers pay tax on a sliding scale.</p> <p>The initiative, introduced nearly a decade ago, is hailed by some as the key to Germany's \"jobs miracle\", which has seen the country register one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe at a time when most of the continent is struggling to cope with recession.</p> <p>However, critics say mini-jobs have locked part of the workforce into low-wage employment (Germany has no minimum wage), with little prospect of advancement, often in sectors such as catering and hospitality. There are also suggestions that <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/08/us-germany-jobs-idUSTRE8170P120120208\" title=\"\">full-time jobs are being split into several mini-jobs</a>, reducing tax income.</p> <p>Despite the potential for controversy, an ally of George Osborne, said: \"What I can tell you is that this is being looked at in government. There are lots of ideas that are being looked at as part of the deregulation drive, and this is one of them.\"</p> <p>Another Treasury source said it was too soon to say whether Osborne would adopt the scheme, but did not rule it out: \"As the chancellor and Danny Alexander have said, it's a relentless focus on the economy, and the consequence of that is we're looking at lots of things.\"</p> <p>Although <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/may/22/vince-cable-tory-plan-sacking-workers\" title=\"\">Liberal Democrats in the coalition were seen as key in blocking ideas for deregulating the labour market put forward in a report by Sir Adrian Beecroft</a>, a party source said it was not true that there was a dispute with Conservatives over the idea of mini-jobs. \"It's definitely something the chancellor is keen on,\" said the source. \"It is not true we are opposing it \u2013 we will look at the options.\"</p> <p>However, those close to the Lib Dem business secretary Vince Cable appeared dismissive. In a statement, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: \"This proposal is a German solution designed to deal with particular issues in the German labour market, driven by their relatively high taxes on labour. This is quite different to the situation in the UK.</p> <p>\"The government is already taking action to take more people out of income tax and we are carrying out a root-and-branch reform of labour laws to make business more effective while maintaining protections for employees.\"</p> <p>At present, workers in the UK can earn <a href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates/it.htm\" title=\"\">\u00a38,105 a year before they start paying tax</a> \u2013 equivalent to \u00a3675 a month. Any new cap in the UK would need to be higher than that currently in place in Germany.</p> <p>Tory MPs who have advocated a scheme styled on mini-jobs include <a href=\"http://www.freeenterprise.org.uk/sites/freeenterprise.drupalgardens.com/files/Learning%20lessons%20from%20Germany.pdf\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Truss</a>, convenor of the Free Enterprise Group, which promotes policy ideas from the right of the party; and one of the 2010 intake of rising stars, Kwasi Kwarteng.</p> <p>The government is also under pressure to make other moves to help the ailing economy, including from Tory MPs calling for more deregulation, housebuilding and a renewed commitment to expanding Heathrow airport. A few Lib Dems have broken ranks with the coalition to appeal for the chancellor to <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f602202e-e6c6-11e1-af33-00144feab49a.html#axzz24010FyXn\" title=\"\">relax the debt reduction targets to spend more</a> on infrastructure building and other short-term assistance for jobs and growth.</p>",
  "<p>Every age has its silliness about what constitutes work, but ours may be the silliest. Britannia Unchained, a book by a group of Tory MPs that will be published before the Conservative party conference in October, is further evidence: the British, it claims, are \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/17/tory-backbenchers-urge-welfare-reforms?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">the worst idlers in the world</a>\". But the problem is not with the British work ethic, but with the changing nature of work.</p> <p>The economist Arthur Pigou once said that if he hired a housekeeper, national income and employment went up, whereas if he married her and she did the same work, they went down. That aphorism still applies: labour statistics still disregard all the work done mainly by women. But women's work is not the only kind of work that does not show up in the employment statistics released last week, based as they are on concepts developed in the industrial 1940s.</p> <p>For one, we are all doing a lot more work outside formal workplaces: completing tasks that cannot be done in paid hours, or doing our best to remain \"competitive\" and up-to-date. Human resource gurus say everybody should devote 15% of their time every year to retraining \u2013 unpaid, of course. Then there is all the work we must do to manage our complex lives, including our financial dealings with the state, as well as care for children and elderly relatives.</p> <p>The social group that is most affected by this kind of work is also known as the \"precariat\": they live and work insecurely, flitting between short-term dead-end jobs, without an occupational identity or opportunity to develop themselves. Many are overqualified for the jobs they are expected to take. They must be flexible, at the beck and call of employers and state agents or their privatised surrogates.</p> <p>Retraining for the precariat is stressful and demoralising; often they learn new tricks only to find them obsolescent or unwanted. In financial affairs and dealings with the state, those in the precariat are disadvantaged since they are usually less well-informed and have to do much more to satisfy demands made on them if they want to gain meagre state benefits.</p> <p>Successive governments in the UK have worked to create a more flexible labour market, which also meant labour insecurity. They allowed wages to drop and non-wage benefits to shrivel, creating worse inequality than statistics reveal. For all of us, work and labour are increasingly continuous, and not done in fixed places at fixed times only. We are bombarded by work demands on our time. Again the precariat is especially disadvantaged. For example, many of them spend untold, unpaid time \"waiting around\" \u2013 witness the spread of oxymoronic \"zero-hours\" employment contracts, under which employees must be ready at any moment to work.</p> <p>Worst of all has been the government's shift to means testing, which means the precariat face marginal tax rates of over 80% as they lose benefits from taking low-paying jobs. Politicians regard 40% as too high for the squeezed middle and the affluent. This erodes incentives at the lower end of the labour market, leading to a vicious circle of falling wages, as well as lower and more conditional benefits, and to workfare. The well-known poverty trap is compounded by what should be called a precarity trap. Because benefits are harder to obtain due to growing conditionality and intrusive monitoring, claimants can wait weeks or months before obtaining them, often doing a lot of work to do so. Suppose, once they have gained entitlement, they are offered a menial job paying low wages. On top of the poverty trap, they face a high probability of soon being back in the queue to obtain benefit entitlement all over again. After a few months they could be worse off than before they took the job. Is refusing such jobs a sign of idleness? No, it's the fault of the policies.</p> <p>The folly of means testing and the inevitable trend to workfare is combined with the folly of tax credits and employment subsidies, designed to create the kind of \"youth jobs\" or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/19/treasury-boost-employment-mini-jobs\">\"German-style mini-jobs\" that the government is currently considering</a>. Research suggests these are expensive and ineffective, a licence to labour inefficiency and low wages, with huge substitution and deadweight effects.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we suffer from too much work. A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/apr/01/chronic-sleep-deprivation-uk-staff\" title=\"\">recent report</a> showed that many Britons experience sleep deprivation due to excessive work done away from the workplace. What we need is a slow time movement to gain control over time, and an overhaul of work statistics to give a better perspective on all the work being done, and how much of it is undesirable, unnecessary and demeaning.</p>",
  "<p><strong>UK-Ecuador relations</strong></p> <p>\"Inside this embassy after dark I could hear teams of police swarming up into the building through its internal fire escape but I knew there would be witnesses and that is because of you,\" said the WikiLeaks founder, addressing supporters who have been turning out to maintain vigils outside the building.</p> <p>\"If the UK did not throw away the Vienna conventions the other night it is because the world was watching and the world was watching because you were watching.\" Julian Assange's reference relates to the second stairwell inside the building in Knightsbridge, west London, that houses the Ecuadorean embassy and other occupants.</p> <p>This stairwell, which would be used to exit the building in an emergency, splits off to the front and back doors and leads to each of the occupants. It is not diplomatic territory.</p> <p>A source who was in the embassy on Wednesday night agreed with Assange's use of the word \"swarming\", adding: \"The kitchen of the embassy leads to the stairwell and the truth is that there was such a hullabaloo at around 9pm that we opened the door from it to look out.</p> <p>\"Once we saw them we just closed the door again and obviously they couldn't come over the threshold.\"</p> <p>The source added that the police presence at that time of the night was \"remarkable\" because about five supporters were in the \"pen\" opposite the embassy, but about 20 police officers were outside the building, along with units from the Metropolitan police territorial support group.</p> <p>The Ecuadorean embassy consists of a ground floor apartment, some 10 rooms in all, inside an imposing redbrick apartment block in London's Knightsbridge area. Other occupants are reported to include members of the Saudi royal family.</p> <p><strong>Bradley Manning</strong></p> <p>\"Bradley Manning must be released. If Bradley Manning did as he is accused, he is a hero, an example to all of us and one of the world's foremost political prisoners,\" said Assange.</p> <p>The 24-year-old is currently detained at an army base awaiting military trial. He has been indicted on 22 counts relating to the leaks, including charges of aiding the enemy. The crime carries a maximum penalty of death, although prosecutors have indicated that they will not seek the ultimate punishment.</p> <p>Assange noted that Manning has spent more than 800 days behind bars without trial. For a large chunk of that time he was kept in conditions that the UN's special rapporteur on torture, Juan Mendez, has described as cruel and inhuman.</p> <p>The young soldier's lawyers are currently seeking to have the charges against Manning dismissed, citing the US army's \"flagrant violation\" of his right not to be punished prior to trial.</p> <p>Manning's civilian lawyer, David Coombs, has said: \"If the department of justice got their way, they would get a plea in this case, and get my client to be named as one of the witnesses to go after Julian Assange and WikiLeaks.\"</p> <p><strong>FBI and WikiLeaks</strong></p> <p>The US must \"renounce its witch-hunt against WikiLeaks\", Assange demanded.

  "<p>The race is almost run for England. Each time they have forced their way back into contention in this series, they have been thwarted by the resilience of South Africa with bat, their voraciousness with ball and their own fallibility in taking catches, a new and unwelcome trait, which has proved costly.</p> <p>For a brief period during the heat of the afternoon England had South Africa on the run as Steve Finn, bowling with genuine hostility but with control that was lacking in the first innings, took the wickets of Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers and Jacques Rudolph in the space of 29 deliveries. By then, though, Amla had made 121, his second century of the series following his monumental unbeaten 311 at The Oval, and second at Lord's, and De Villiers had 43. Both had made England rue the dropped catches that reprieved Amla on Saturday, when he was on two, and De Villiers on eight.</p> <p>At 282 for seven South Africa were already favourites to win the match but just for good measure JP Duminy and Vernon Philander, joint top scorers for the tourists in the first innings, made it even more certain that England cannot win \u2013 a primary consideration \u2013 with an eighth-wicket stand of 54. When Jimmy Anderson finally bowled Imran Tahir to end the innings, and hoofed the ball down to the Nursery as much in relief as anything, South Africa had taken their second innings to 351, leaving England to bat for 13 challenging overs to the close and a full day to score 346 to win.</p> <p>Immediately the South Africa bowlers put things in perspective. The new ball swung, as it has done all match, cloud or no cloud. (Do they have a different batch of balls from those used in previous games?) But once more they or, to be precise, Philander proving himself to be a terrific Test cricketer in this series, made better use. His second ball found Alastair Cook planting his front leg on off-stump and playing down the wrong line as it swung in to have him lbw, a classic dismissal for a right-arm pace bowler. In his next over he brought to a close Strauss's personal contribution to his 100th Test and what has been a trying week when the batsman offered no stroke to another inswinger and was similarly unquestionably lbw. Perhaps this was the action of a man drained mentally. More likely, though, he had been undone by the previous, similar delivery, that almost cut him in half and flew over the top of the stumps from a similar length.</p> <p>As the shadows lengthened, Morkel, Dale Steyn and Philander all tore in to try to make further inroads but were thwarted by Jonathan Trott and Ian Bell. England resume the final day on 15 for two, requiring a further 330 to win and save both series and No1 status. History, on which we draw so heavily when trying to determine such chances, says that this is unlikely. Only Australia, in 2009, when they made 406, only to lose the match, have made more in the fourth innings of a Lord's Test, and only West Indies, who cocked a snook at David Gower's declaration in 1984 and made 344 for one, have come close to that in order to win. South Africa can put their drinks on ice: they are demonstrably the better side.</p> <p>The drop-off in the quality of England's close catching is starting to become an issue, something that tends not to be so manifest against weaker sides where more chances are created but is fundamental against a batting side as strong and resolute as that of South Africa. When England have been on top of their game in the past few years, they have held pretty much everything that should be taken and a few more besides. In this three-match series too many takeable catches have gone begging and, aside from some good work by Matt Prior, nothing spectacular, the kind that gives a bowler a bonus \u2013 Paul Collingwood's, say, to get rid of Ricky Ponting in Perth or that of Strauss to dispose of Adam Gilchrist at Trent Bridge seven years ago \u2013 has been taken.. South Africa by contrast have taken everything.</p> <p>Three catches went down in the South African second innings here. A sharp one offered by Rudolph past the left shoulder of Strauss, standing at slip to Graeme Swann \u2013 a place usually occupied by Anderson \u2013 cost very little. But the one that Prior dropped down the leg side on Saturday to reprieve Amla off Stuart Broad, not as difficult as he appeared to anticipate given the ground he made so readily, was the costliest.</p> <p>Yesterday Anderson, generally regarded as the most athletic all-round fielder that the pace bowling fraternity can have produced, failed to take De Villiers' relatively straightfoward clip low to short midwicket, off Swann once more, and, prone on the turf, buried his head in his hands.</p> <p>On the back of England's generosity of spirit, Amla batted beautifully, a batsman who has the capacity of all the best players in appearing to make time slow down so that he can see the ball early and play it late. He scores runs almost by stealth, with flickering strokes off his legs and elegant drives, like a scoreboard operator ticking off his score in 10s when no one is looking. Only when Finn suddenly found his rhythm in the afternoon and produced his best bowling of the summer did he look flustered but it still took a fine delivery to remove him, the ball clipping his off-stump after holding its line against the slope rather than follow its natural path down the hill. An innings such as his deserved a special ending.</p> <p>De Villiers was more frenetic, looking to assert himself from the off with boundaries from his first two balls, and he provided a counterpoint to Amla. Again, though, it took another excellent ball from Finn, holding its line once more, to find the edge for Strauss to complete the catch at first slip, his 122nd, thus overtaking Colin Cowdrey and Ian Botham for the most catches for England by a non-wicketkeeper.</p>",
  "<p>An 11-year-old Christian Pakistani girl could face the death penalty under the country's notorious blasphemy laws, after she was accused by her neighbours of deliberately burning sacred Islamic texts.</p> <p>Rifta Masih was arrested on Thursday, after complaints against her prompted angry demonstrations. Asif Ali Zardari, the president, has ordered the interior ministry to investigate the case.</p> <p>As communal tensions continued to rise, about 900 Christians living on the outskirts of Islamabad have been ordered to leave a neighbourhood where they have lived for almost two decades.</p> <p>On Sunday, houses on the backstreets of Mehrabadi, an area 20 minutes' drive from western embassies and government ministries, were locked with padlocks, their occupants having fled to already overcrowded Christian slums in and around the capital.</p> <p>One of the senior members of the dominant Muslim community told the Christians to remove all their belongings from their houses by 1 September. \"I don't think anyone will dare go back after this,\" said one Christian, Arif Masih. \"The area is not safe for us now.\"</p> <p>A few brave souls have stayed behind, but shopkeepers have refused to serve their Christian neighbours or supply them with water. Locals say only about 10% of families in the area are Christian, renting cramped houses from Muslim landlords. They tend to do dirty, menial jobs such as sewer maintenance.</p> <p>Relations between the communities had been simmering for months after complaints were made about the noise coming from three churches in the area during religious services. Two of the landlords who owned the buildings had already ordered an end to worship and some services were forcibly broken up.</p> <p>But there was no indication that all the Christians would be forced out so suddenly until Rifta was accused of the provocative act of burning the sacred words of Islam.</p> <p>It sparked immediate demonstrations by crowds estimated at between 600 and 1,000 people, some of whom blocked the nearby Kashmir highway, the major road running west out of the capital.</p> <p>The police, initially unwilling to take action, eventually charged the girl with blasphemy and took her into custody. The rest of the community, including her parents, fled.</p> <p>As with many other aspects of the incident, there is disagreement about exactly what was burned. Some say it was a small pocket book of Qur'anic verses. Others claim it was pages of the Qur'an. Either it was a relatively small quantity of ash carried in an earthenware dish, or it was around half a kilogram of refuse that filled a small plastic shopping bag.</p> <p>Hammad Malik, a 23-year-old with a shaven head and bushy beard who is deemed a \"scoundrel\" by the Christian community, said he saw Rifta walking out of the tiny, single-room dwelling where she lived with her parents and sister at some time after 6pm. He said it was pure chance that he noticed her bundle.</p> <p>\"I looked at it but did not know exactly what it was but I could see it had words written in Arabic,\" he said.</p> <p>He concedes that no one actually saw her burning anything as the offence allegedly happened inside the house, and she was caught while finding somewhere to throw away the remains. However, the local mullah claims there was a witness: another young girl who caught her in the act and then ran to the mosque to raise the alarm.</p> <p>One thing the Muslim community does agree on is that claims in the local media, sourced to the police, that the girl has Down's syndrome are false.</p> <p>\"She is a completely normal girl,\" said Kamran Khan, cousin of the Masih family's landlord. As the largely male and grownup crowd gathered outside the house, a girl who said she knew Rifta said she did behave oddly \u2013 she talked to herself and walked in a peculiar way.</p> <p>The other point of general agreement is that \"the law should be followed\". Unfortunately, the law in question is Pakistan's blasphemy law, which has a proven track record of ensnaring people on the flimsiest of evidence and being cynically used to intimidate communities or settle quarrels over money and property.</p> <p>Even though no one has yet been executed for blasphemy in Pakistan, long prison terms are common \u2013 one Christian couple was sentenced to 25 years in 2010 after being accused of touching the Qur'an with unwashed hands.</p> <p>There have also been cases of people killed by lynch mobs demanding instant punishment. Daring to criticise the law is incredibly risky and few do it.</p> <p>In 2011, Salman Taseer, the former governor of Punjab province, was gunned down by his own bodyguard after he spoke out against the case of Aasia Bibi, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/08/salmaan-taseer-blasphemy-pakistan-bibi\" title=\"\">another Christian woman accused of blasphemy</a>.</p> <p>The Christian community of Mehrabadi says the whole thing is a plot. They too have conflicting accounts of what happened. In one version, according to priest Boota Masih, a Muslim neighbour asked the girl to throw out the ash into which the desecrated pages had been placed.</p> <p>Either way, one hotly contested incident involving a very young girl looks set to change the complexion of the neighbourhood for ever.</p> <p>\"They have done this to provoke the Muslims, like they have with their noisy banging and singing from their churches,\" said a local mullah, who would not give his name. \"We are not upset the Christians have left and we will be pleased if they don't come back.\"</p>",
  "<p>Irvine Welsh, the author of Trainspotting, lashed out at the \"highly imperialist-orientated Man Booker prize\", whose winners have alternated \"between largely upper-middle-class English writers and citizens of the former colonies, presumably to stamp legitimacy on this 'global accolade'\".</p> <p>Speaking at the <a href=\"http://www.edinburghworldwritersconference.org\" title=\"\">Edinburgh international writers' conference</a>, he added that the organisers' failure to refute accusations of anti-Scottishness, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2012/jul/27/booker-prize-bias-english\" title=\"\">already voiced by Scottish writers such as Alan Bissett</a>, was a sign of \"arrogance\" and \"intellectual enfeeblement\".</p> <p>Welsh, who is famous for using Scottish dialect in his novels, said: \"The Booker prize's contention to be an inclusive, non-discriminatory award could be demolished by anybody with even a rudimentary grasp of sixth-form sociology.\"</p> <p>The award, he said, was \"based on the conceit that upper-class Englishness is the cultural yardstick against which all literature must be measured\".</p> <p>Welsh <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/19/irvine-welsh-a-national-literature\" title=\"\">was speaking </a>on the third day of the five-day conference, held at the <a href=\"http://www.edbookfest.co.uk\" title=\"\">Edinburgh international book festival</a>. The event is a restaging of the famous <a href=\"http://www.edinburghworldwritersconference.org/background/\" title=\"\">1962 Edinburgh writers' conference</a> when Rebecca West and Mary McCarthy snarled at each other; the then unknown William Burroughs \u2013 who was staying with Alexander Trocchi's doctor so they could both be amply supplied with heroin \u2013 sprang on to the international literary scene; and Muriel Spark said very little except what was icily to the point.</p> <p>Welsh, giving the keynote address at the session on nationalism, said that the rise of globalised culture meant it \"would be difficult for Trainspotting to be published today by a London-based publisher. The market has become much more defined and Trainspotting doesn't fit into any defined slot.\"</p> <p>In a wide-ranging debate on localism, regionalism and nationalism in literature \u2013 without the near-fisticuffs that characterised the 1962 version, but with passionate applause for writers' statements and a certain amount of barracking against Ian Rankin's chairing of the session \u2013 Glasgow-based author Ewan Morrison argued that universalism, the great ideal of the postwar world, had been most effectively harnessed by global capitalism, and must at all costs be fought against. As Bissett put it, \"protectionism for local cultures is sometimes necessary\".</p> <p>But Ben Okri, who won the 1991 Booker prize for The Famished Road, contested the terms of the argument, quoting Wole Soyinka's statement that a tiger doesn't debate its \"tigritude\"; it just pounces.</p> <p>Okri continued: \"The writer writes. As well as they can, as truthfully as they can from the depth of their spirits \u2026 If you say this space is Scottishness, you have limited the possibilities of Scottishness for all time \u2026 if you overdefine what is a national literature you will constantly reproduce a cycle of cliches.\"</p> <p>The previous day's debate on style versus content saw the work of EL James condemned as \"fucking dangerous\" by poet Nick Laird, and \"mental vomit\" by poet and essayist Kapka Kassabova.</p> <p>The session was kicked off by novelist Ali Smith <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/18/ali-smith-novelists-approach-art\" title=\"\">with a virtuoso provocation</a>: style, she said, was a kind of roaring with life. \"Style \u2026 makes what's being told,\" she said. \"A story is its style.\"</p> <p>But could style \u2013 think of James Joyce \u2013 make books inaccessible? Bissett said: \"I worry how style can exclude. You think about the people who are not convinced by literature and find it for a small elite \u2026 Style risks become fetishised and it becomes stylish people talking to one another.\"</p> <p>China Mi\u00e9ville disagreed: the argument \"risks being patronising\", he said. He added: \"If we try to second-guess readers it's a fool's game \u2026 Our job is not to give readers what they want, it is to try to make readers want what we give.</p> <p>\"Increasingly one reads books that are beautifully put and rather bloodless and anodyne. And I would much rather read an honourable failure than a dishonourable success, particularly in the case of style.\"</p> <p>The Argentinian writer Carlos Gamerro agreed: \"Three cheers for difficult writers who write for other writers!\"</p> <p>The first session had raised the question: should literature be political? Ahdaf Soueif, the Egyptian novelist and essayist, said it was too soon for her homeland's revolution to be fictionalised.</p> <p>\"A truly imagined and felt novel of the Egyptian revolution? I don't see how it can be done,\" she said. When the novelist was wrapped up in activism, the space and time and nuance for fiction could not emerge, she argued.</p> <p>Okri agreed: \"When your house is burning, your first job is to put the fire out: you don't write as a way of putting out the fire.\"</p> <p>Mi\u00e9ville said that the contents of a work could be overstated. Because the novel was a commodified art form (like it or lump it) various avenues of \"cultural performance\" were made possible; when Iain Banks's calling for a cultural boycott of Israel in 2010 was a powerful act, even though \"he writes about space ships\" and not Palestine.</p> <p>It was left to the Chinese poet Xi Chuan to question the idea of the moral purpose of the novel.</p> <p>\"We are taking it for granted that we are all good people, kind people, as we talk about this topic. But another question might be: should literature be fascist? Should be literature be Stalinist?</p> <p>\"There are hidden meanings here. Should literature be something that expresses your values, to show that you are a good or a kind person?\"</p>",
  "<p>So <a href=\"http://www.dandy.com/\" title=\"\">the Dandy</a>, Britain's longest-running comic, is to set to become an online-only operation as of this December. This news was greeted with a small chorus of dismay from people who presumably haven't read the thing in decades, unless they're psychologically damaged or trapped overnight in a&#xa0;paediatrician's waiting room.</p> <p>Of course rather than standing up for the artists and writers of the comic itself, they're simply bemoaning the death of something from their own childhoods, the narcissists. Insulted by progress, affronted by change, they prefer everything kept just the way it was when they last saw it. You know how in every bad crime drama ever there's a scene in which a detective searches for clues in the bedroom of a young girl who died 10 years ago, and whose grieving parents have left her room untouched as a kind of shrine? That's how these conceited lunatics expect the world to work. Everything preserved in their honour, because they're God. I'm not exaggerating. That's what they believe. Anyone mourning the death of the print edition of the Dandy, even for half a second, is a staggering egotist who earnestly believes him or herself to be a supreme deity whose every belch and fart should be bottled for posterity. Jail the scum. Jail them hard. Jail their heads off. Throw the jail at them. Jail.</p> <p>Why is the Dandy going all-digital? Because it's a magazine for children, and today's children don't seem to want magazines any more than I wanted a 1920s whirligig when I was their age. Kids today have <a href=\"http://www.moshimonsters.com/\" title=\"\">Moshi Monsters</a> and the Nerf Vortex Nitron Blaster. Traditional ink on paper looks like medieval tapestry to them. This is the price you pay for technological advancement. On the plus side: fewer cases of rickets.</p> <p>Maybe I'm shrugging slightly because I never really liked the Dandy back when I was sufficiently young enough to be able to openly read it on the bus without people taking a Twitpic and circulating it as a warning to any parents in the area. Even then \u2013 and we're talking late 70s, early 80s here \u2013 the Dandy and its sister title the Beano felt to me like staid relics bought by sentimental parents for their unappreciative offspring. I was more of a Whizzer and Chips kid, preferring the London-based Fleetway/IPC stable of comics (Buster, Whoopee, Krazy, Jackpot, etc) which seemed a shade more anarchic, and weren't hamstrung by having to include characters created in the 1930s who still walked around wearing monocles.</p> <p>I enjoyed them for the artwork, but I don't think I ever actually laughed at the stories, which is odd because not only were the strips themselves routinely peppered with slightly boastful depictions of readers weeping with laughter over the latest issue, the characters themselves would often break the fourth wall, looking you in the eye in the final panel, saying something like \"Ho ho, readers! Looks like Dad's having a thumping good time!\" while their father was violently assaulted by a boxing kangaroo in the background.</p> <p>Viz began life in 1979, partly as a parody of this laboured formula, and later, when I was 15, a sort of unofficial children's version of Viz appeared \u2013 a lightly subversive comic called Oink. I sent some cartoons to their letters page and was astonished when they wrote back inviting me to come up with some characters for them. Overnight I was a professional cartoonist, and even though I could scarcely draw, I spent the next few years churning out strips and parodies from my bedroom. My regulars included Freddie Flop (a boy whose limbs kept falling off for no reason whatsoever), Transmogrifying Tracey (a girl who could transform into anything for no reason whatsoever), Regurgitating Robbie (a boy who could vomit useful objects for no reason whatsoever) and The Adventures of Death (in which the punchline always consisted of the grim reaper decapitating someone for no reason whatsoever). Looking back now, I can see that my attempts at mocking the formula of the established comics chiefly consisted of adhering to a&#xa0;formula of my own.</p> <p>Annoyingly, Oink folded just as I needed some kind of regular income, on account of leaving home and becoming an adult. I carried on drawing comic strips for various Viz rip-offs, video-games mags and eventually my own website, before finally giving up completely some time around the year 2000. Occasionally I miss cartooning. And then I remember that I never really got the hang of drawing shoes.</p> <p>So I was never cut out for the long haul. But I was doing it long enough to see the nuts-and-bolts of cartooning undergo a seismic&#xa0;change. When I started out, I drew everything in pencil on A3 paper, went over it in ink, rolled it up and posted it to the office in a cardboard tube. By the time I finished I was using Wacom tablets and Photoshop. Sod nostalgia, it was 200 times better.</p> <p>Which is why I think moving online is clearly the best thing that can happen to the Dandy. Rather than remaining trapped inside a steadily dying format, it can experiment with partially animated strips, stories that turn into games, characters that address the reader using their actual name, and so on. God knows. And then maybe somewhere down the line it'll become so popular it'll make financial sense to produce a sort of paper-based spin-off from the website, in the form of a weekly magazine filled with comic strips. Right, readers?</p>",
  "<p>At 23, <a href=\"http://www.tatyanamcfadden.com/\" title=\"\">Tatyana McFadden</a> is already a veteran Paralympian. The first international wheelchair racing competition she entered was the Athens Games in 2004, when she was 15, winning a silver medal in the 100m and a bronze in the 200m. In Beijing, she took home three silvers and a&#xa0;bronze. This year, older and stronger, she hopes to add&#xa0;a&#xa0;gold medal to her haul.</p> <p>She is in with a good chance. Last year, she won four gold medals at the IPC World Championships and won the Chicago marathon (she had already won the New York marathon the previous year). At London 2012, she will be competing in the 100m, 400m, 800m, 1500m and marathon: \"so my training has been varied. In the autumn I concentrate on marathon training; in the spring I concentrated on track work. I&#xa0;go to the gym a lot to build strength.\" She says she is happy with how it has gone. \"The training has always been pretty tough, and you have your hard days but that just makes you stronger.\"</p> <p>Born in St Petersburg, McFadden spent the first six years of her life in a Russian orphanage. She was born with spina bifida, a condition that affects the development of the spine and resulted in paralysis, and the orphanage didn't have a wheelchair for her to use.&#xa0;In 1994, Debbie McFadden, then commissioner of disabilities for the US health department, visited the orphanage and decided to adopt Tatyana.</p> <p>In the US, she was encouraged to become more active to build her strength and found competitive sport suited her character. \"I did many different sports \u2013 wheelchair basketball, archery, swimming. When I started racing, it was a natural fit for me. \"I like the speed, and the competition and I love the training, no matter how tough it is,\" she says.</p> <p>McFadden is known to her teammates as Beast. \"At first I wasn't sure about it,\" she says. \"It's kind of a manly name, but it stuck. I got it after my win for my first marathon, about how strong I was and how fast I could climb hills.\"</p> <p>While she took to sport naturally, it wasn't easy for her to participate. She successfully sued Maryland state for equal access to sport at her high school after <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/17/AR2006041701886.html\" title=\"\">a lawsuit lasting four years</a>. \"All I wanted to do in high school was get involved in sport and be on a par with my peers,\" she says. \"That was a very tough battle but it was worth fighting for because it gave other people the opportunity to do sport.\" One of them, she points out, is her younger sister, Hannah, who will be racing against her in the 100m. \"I think the law has been passed in 15 other states now,\" she says. \"It was like a domino effect. There are a lot more disabled athletes out there, and it's all about starting locally \u2013 that's how Paralympic sport will grow, if you allow people to get involved.\"</p>",
  "<p>The last Paralympics were disappointing for <a href=\"http://cms.fencing.ca/Pierre-Mainville\" title=\"\">Pierre Mainville</a> \u2013 he finished ninth in the epee, and 17th in the sabre. \"It was special because it was my first Paralympics,\" he says from his home near Montreal. \"But I didn't have a very good result because I was injured. I don't want to say I'm going to take the podium, but it should be different this time.\"</p> <p>In this event, the wheelchair is fixed and athletes use only their upper body. \"You have one arm on an armrest, which helps you get your body in position for offence or defence,\" says Mainville, 39. \"My arm has to be very strong, but my right arm is more for precision and speed.\" The training, which he does every day, includes weight work in the gym for strength, as well as perfecting his technique in fencing lessons.</p> <p>Mainville became paralysed in a shooting accident in 2001, forcing him to leave his job as a test driver for a car company. One of his best friends was already using a wheelchair as a result of an accident some years earlier, \"so I knew there was life after paraplegia. When I was injured myself, I realised when you have limits they are often self-imposed.\" Before his injury, he was very sporty and as soon as he was able to, he went back to sport. \"I tried different sports in a wheelchair \u2013 sledge hockey, wheelchair basketball and sailing but when I found fencing I fell in love with it because I was always better in individual sports.\"</p> <p>Within two years, he was training seriously, travelling around the world for competitions. He&#xa0;has won bronze medals in the last few major championships but the man&#xa0;known as <a href=\"http://www.paralympic.ca/en/Super-Athletes/The-Perfectionist.html\" title=\"\">the Perfectionist</a> believes he can go further. \"If I do everything correctly, I think I can go&#xa0;for&#xa0;the best.\"</p>",
  "<p>If you live in the Bath area, you might spot Ben Rushgrove, British sprinter, silver medallist at Beijing, on his way to the corner shop. He would be the one with the very long stride, \"overtaking the other pedestrians on the footpath\". His mother has said that as a child, learning to put one foot in front of the other, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jun/23/ben-rushgrove-paralympics-family\" title=\"\">he had only one speed: fast</a>. \"Well,\" he says, \"my mum likes to put that one out there. But, yes, I always remember being enthusiastic about running. I've always wanted to get somewhere quickly. The bottom line is, I am impatient I want things done yesterday. I'm always wanting to be doing something, going somewhere. When I look in my diary and there's nothing in it, my heart sinks. I can relax when the occasion arises, but generally I am happy when I've got something to do.\" He says he never walks at a leisurely pace.</p> <p>Fast is Rushgrove's business. He is one of Britain's strongest medal hopes when he takes to the track for the 200m on Friday 31 Aug and the 100m, his preferred event, on Saturday 1 September. He says it is the intensity of the shorter sprint \u2013 the months of training, the tense hours of build-up to the off, and then all over before you know it \u2013 that he loves. \"You don't have the luxury of thinking when you're running. In fact, if you think too much, your brain interferes with your speed. I run the race every time I train. Every time you train, your body learns how to run this race better. Every time you do a start, your body instinctively knows what to do.The idea is that when you turn up in London all you are doing is the same thing you have done a million times.\"</p> <p>That's sort of true, of course, but not entirely. Such is Paralympics fervour that Rushgrove can't shop in Sainsbury's without people wishing him good luck. He was an unknown in Beijing, winning his silver despite having two broken bones in his foot. \"The interest has skyrocketed.\" For all the practice races, all the reliance on instinct to take over, when he takes his place on the starting block, the noise of the stadium swirling around him, it won't be a day like any other, will it? Actually, the noise of the stadium is on his mind. Rushgrove is classified as profoundly deaf, though that's not a definition he likes (he prefers: \"I function very well in a hearing world\"). He runs with a hearing aid and although in his event he isn't alone in that, he worries that the crowd will be so lively he won't be able to hear the starter and vital hundredth-seconds of reaction time may be lost. \"It's very important for everyone to be really quiet at the start of the race.\"</p> <p>Those fractional moments will be even more important if Rushgrove, who has cerebral palsy, is having what he calls \"a CP day\". On those days, \"the muscle tone goes through the roof. Picking things up becomes more challenging. You have to think more about everything. But if it happens, it's not as if we can say: 'Postpone the race! Rushgrove's having a CP day!' We have to try to work with it.\" Hot baths help, but when the stadium finally goes quiet, \"All I can do is stand on the start line and run as fast as I can. Either it will be good enough or won't be good enough. In athletics it's very stark. You know very quickly whether what you've done is good enough or not. it's quite a brutal reality-check if you cross the line and haven't done what you thought you would.\"</p> <p>Rushgrove is \"sincerely hoping\" for a medal but he promises that Team GB \"will do Britain proud. Anybody watching will not be able to not be amazed. They will be flabbergasted by the times and speeds and difficulties these people have, and the way they overcome them.\"</p>",
  "<p>Many of us are already cyborgs. If you have a contraceptive coil fitted, or a pacemaker \u2013 arguably even if you wear contact lenses or have pierced ears \u2013 then you are in a sense part-human and part-machine.

This causes nearby magnetic fields \u2013 and even their strength and shape \u2013 to become detectable to the user, thanks to the subtle currents they provoke. For a party trick, they can also pick up metal objects or make other magnets move around.</p> <p>Calling this a procedure, though, gives rather the wrong impression. Biohacking is not a field of medicine. Instead it is carried out either at home or in piercing shops, cleanly and carefully with a scalpel, but without an anaesthetic (which you need a licence for). If you think this sounds painful, you are correct.</p> <p>Britain is the birthplace of modern transhumanism, as the field is known. Probably the most sophisticated implantation ever made can be found inside the left arm of <a href=\"http://www.kevinwarwick.com/\" title=\"\">Kevin Warwick</a>, professor of cybernetics at the University of Reading, who can now control a robot arm by moving his own. The system also works the other way, so he can now sense his wife's movements in his own body, after she had a similar implantation.</p> <p>A more intuitive exponent is <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/12/transcending-the-human-diy-style/\" title=\"\">Lepht Anonym</a>, the&#xa0;name used by a young woman in Aberdeen, who has performed many <a href=\"http://sapiensanonym.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">adaptations on herself at home</a> using nothing more sophisticated than sharp implements and vodka. She began with a sensor that allowed her to lock and unlock her computer, and then fitted a temperature display that emerged through the skin, though this was not a success.</p> <p>To Warwick, Anonym and the wider grinding community, who meet online in forums such as <a href=\"http://discuss.biohack.me/\" title=\"\">biohack.me</a>, implanted technology or \"wetware\" represents the next stage in mankind's evolution. And, indeed, the idea is not outlandish. Brain stimulation from implanted electrodes is already a routine treatment for Parkinson's and other diseases, and there are prototypes that promise to let paralysed people control computers, wheelchairs and robotic limbs.</p> <p>Last week, X-Men producer Bryan Singer launched <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/08/14/h_from_bryan_singer_web_tv_series_explores_transhumanism_video_.html\" title=\"\">a web TV&#xa0;series called H+</a> prophesying&#xa0;the cataclysmic consequences of all this.

  "<p>One thing you can say for&#xa0;certain about the Bostonian singer <a href=\"http://www.amandapalmer.net/\" title=\"\">Amanda Palmer</a> is that she isn't crippled by shyness. The&#xa0;brick walls of the London venue Village&#xa0;Underground are adorned with dozens of artworks commissioned to accompany her new album, Theatre Is Evil.

It's a lot of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/amanda-palmer\" title=\"\">Amanda&#xa0;Palmer</a>.</p> <p>The woman herself, a gregarious, quick-to-laugh 36-year-old in a kimono, wanders the room talking with fans, while the droll, black-clad Gaiman, the other half of what Wired magazine has christened <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CFAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Funderwire%2F2012%2F07%2Fneil-gaiman-on-sandman-and-amanda-palmer-talks-theatre-is-evil%2F&amp;ei=mQMtUNnHGYWe0QWi_IG4DA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEU1izqWFTK1efyES09TK1fcuq-xg\" title=\"\">\"geekdom's power couple\"</a>, hovers in the background. The exhibition, and the intimate concert that sprouts from it as the evening progresses, is Palmer's way of rewarding some of the fans who recently contributed a record-breaking $1.2m (\u00a3762,000) via crowdfunding website <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/\" title=\"\">Kickstarter</a> to pay for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/album/e2c16c13-46a1-4f86-97c4-79450edc4d87\" title=\"\">Theatre Is Evil</a>. <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2012/06/crowdfunding-music\" title=\"\">Even the Economist was moved to weigh in</a> on whether this was the future of album&#xa0;financing or just some fabulous fluke. Inevitably, a few people were unimpressed.</p> <p>\"There's a huge cloud of shame around art and business being seen as bedfellows,\" says Palmer a few days after the exhibition. Her conversation is loud and throaty and pebbledashed with expletives. \"Which of course they fucking are, and everyone knows it. It's funny, the people in the industry who think what I'm doing is tasteless and shameful and sad. 'Poor Amanda Palmer, having to Kickstart her record and talk about her finances.

The Kickstarter bonanza was made possible by a decade of tireless communication with fans, as a solo artist as well as half of <a href=\"http://www.dresdendolls.com/\" title=\"\">the Dresden Dolls</a>, the \"Brechtian punk cabaret\" band currently on hiatus. She has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amandapalmer\" title=\"\">taken to Twitter</a> like a natural. Her followers (currently approaching 600,000) tracked her flirtation with Gaiman over several months, and found out about their surprise wedding two years ago via <a href=\"http://starcasm.net/archives/79748\" title=\"\">a tweeted photograph</a>. \"I realised making that announcement was one of the most significant moments in our marriage because that's where our friends all are,\" she says, waving her metallic-green iPhone. \"It may seem like an ephemeral, insignificant platform to some but, the way I use it, it's a very functional community space like a bar or a living room. Twitter fascinates me because it's real. It feels kind of unreal, but it makes very real things happen.\"</p> <p>She imposes some restrictions on herself. She won't tweet or blog about anyone who asks her not to, and she won't be negative. Years ago, she wrote an angry blog about being mistreated in an upmarket piano shop and realised to her horror that she had unleashed a flood of hate mail on the shop from supportive Dresden Dolls fans. \"I&#xa0;remember thinking, 'Oh,&#xa0;I&#xa0;really have a lot of power here. I&#xa0;have to wield it very carefully.'\"</p> <p>However, she holds nothing back about herself. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amanda-palmer/on-abortion-rape-and-humo_b_166782.html\" title=\"\">In a 2009 blog defending her song Oasis</a>, a blackly comic number about abortion and date rape, she mentioned in passing that she had experienced both.\"I think I've been addicted to openness since long before&#xa0;my rock career. I was terrible as&#xa0;a teenager. I used to go out of my way to make people uncomfortable with personal details. I was always fascinated by the idea that we have these weird, random boundaries between what we do and don't show.\"</p> <p>This extreme emotional candour feeds into her songs, whose tart sting sometimes suggests a piano-playing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2005/jul/30/edinburghfestival2005.classics\" title=\"\">Dorothy Parker</a> and explains her cult appeal among the similarly arty and intense (Lady Gaga is a fan). Inspired in her youth by performance artists, she has been an artist's model, a stripper and, for several years, a living statue in Cambridge, Massachusetts's Harvard Square, where she learned long before Kickstarter that you can, in fact, rely on the kindness of strangers. At the end of&#xa0;the Village Underground show,&#xa0;she disrobes and invites fans to scrawl on her naked body.</p> <p>\"I've always had an insatiable desire to be looked at,\" she admits. \"I was born ready for the stage.&#xa0;I was the youngest of four kids and, from day one, the look-at-me one.&#xa0;But I got a lot of, 'Amanda, quit trying to get attention.' Nobody wants&#xa0;to be seen as an attention-getter&#xa0;because it's narcissistic and selfish and icky. Really&#xa0;good performers who have that&#xa0;hunger figure out how to use it to connect, rather than just suck energy. I&#xa0;didn't want to be a pathetic psycho prancing around on stage, desperate for love. So I went through this whole struggle of despising myself and not being able to&#xa0;figure myself out. It took ages. Thank God my best friend's a therapist.\" She laughs loudly.</p> <p>At the moment, life is hectic. While she still lives in Boston, Gaiman is based in the midwest. \"My next big creative step is to write a book about how to be two married artists who barely see each other and manage to stay in love,\" she says. As well as touring commitments, she has to deliver the rewards she promised on Kickstarter, including 35 private concerts in donors' houses. Gaiman recently told Wired that he thought of everything his wife does as \"one giant interconnected piece of performance art called Amanda Palmer. Amanda Palmer gets painted, Amanda Palmer tweets, Amanda Palmer makes an album \u2013 it all sort of ties in. It's all about connection.\"</p> <p>\"I know a lot of musicians who are way less social than I am,\" says Palmer, \"and they are flabbergasted that I have the desire to go out there and forge the connections and deal with the crap that inevitably goes with it. But to me, being a social artist is its own artform. And, luckily, I <em>like</em> the fans.\"</p> <p>Palmer tells a story about when she was 18 and her favourite band, Anglo-Dutch art-rockers the <a href=\"http://legendarypinkdots.org/\" title=\"\">Legendary Pink Dots</a>, played in Boston. They stayed at the house of one of Palmer's friends, who invited her over and insisted she play them her demo tape. It was terrifying, but then she went outside for a cigarette with the band's singer and he told her, sincerely, that her music was great.</p> <p>\"My head exploded,\" she says, animated by the memory. \"I walked on air for four days. It was like someone had come over to me with a magic wand and said: You have legitimate permission to go forth and be a rock star. He didn't have to say that. He didn't have to listen to my demo tape. He could have fucked off and gone to bed. And that,\" she firmly concludes, \"is the spirit that I wanted to live in.\"</p>",
  "<p>Anton Vickerman probably didn't want to enter the history books in this way. As the founder of surfthechannel.com, a website that provided links to TV and film content \u2013 in a significant number of cases, unlicensed and illicit \u2013 the 38-year-old last week became <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/aug/14/anton-vickerman-surfthechannel-sentenced\" title=\"\">the first person in Britain to be jailed for running a site linking to pirate material</a>. He was jailed for four years after a private prosecution brought by the <a href=\"http://www.fact-uk.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Federation Against Copyright Theft</a>, AKA Fact, funded by the TV and film industries.</p> <p>In a furious 18,000-word commentary on his website, Vickerman says a lawyer had advised him that Surfthechannel was legal. Fact, he alleges, behaved like a private police force \u2013 with employees and private investigators using subterfuge to get hold of personal information. But worse: it acted without oversight or any sort of restriction on behaviour, intent on its task of trapping alleged copyright \"thieves\". (Although as any lawyer will point out, there's no such offence as copyright \"theft\", only \"infringement\", because by its very nature if you take a copy, the original remains. But \"Federation Against Copyright Infringement\" doesn't have quite the same ring.)</p> <p>For its part, Fact is unapologetic, and declined to comment on Vickerman's allegations. \"If what he was doing was legal, why did he go to such lengths to hide his identity and location?\" said a spokesman for Fact. \"Why not just operate as a legitimate business in the UK? Why did he set the site up anonymously, and make it so hard to find him?\"</p> <p>In the ongoing \"content wars\", between those who run sites that offer links to all sorts of content, and the people who don't always want those links to exist, Vickerman's conviction marks the conclusion of a remarkable battle. After Google's announcement this month that it would <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/aug/10/google-algorithm-hollywood-lobbyists-copyright\" title=\"\">demote sites with high numbers of copyright complaints</a>, the content owners seem to be getting an edge.</p> <p>And Fact, long known as a pitbull when it comes to pursuing alleged copyright infringers, now has a victory that it can use to intimidate others who might be thinking about setting up link sites.</p> <p>In his writing on Surfthechannel, Vickerman expresses amazement and fury at the prosecution and the lengths that Fact went to in order to mount it, especially after the Crown Prosecution Service declined to mount a case under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act (CDPA). Other cases where links websites have been tried under forms of the CDPA, including TVlinks and Newzbin, have not found them guilty of infringement. The CPS also declined to prosecute Richard O'Dwyer, who ran tvshack.net, another links site.</p> <p>What's so different about Surfthechannel? Nikki Powell, an intellectual property lawyer at the London-based Addleshaw Goddard, points out that Fact did not bring a case under the CDPA; instead, Vickerman was tried under the criminal charge of \"conspiracy to defraud\" (specifically, to defraud the film companies whose pirated products were being linked to).</p> <p>\"That's much harder to prove,\" Powell says. \"You have to show that all the parties have the intention to [financially] harm the plaintiff.\" The <a href=\"http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.uk/Publications/Documents/conspiracy%20to%20defraud%20final.pdf\" title=\"\">attorney general's guidance</a> suggests such cases involve some or all of \"several significant but different kinds of criminality; several jurisdictions; different types of victims, eg individuals and banks; organised crime networks\". By choosing to prosecute Vickerman under that law, Fact was arguably setting the bar high, because it also had to match the criminal standard of conviction \u2013 that is, beyond reasonable doubt \u2013 unlike civil cases, which are decided on \"balance of evidence\". And if Fact lost, it would bear all the costs of both defence and prosecution.</p> <p>Fact's case \u2013 which the jury accepted \u2013 is that Vickerman conspired with others to put the infringing content online and link to it, thus denying the film producers, cinema chains, DVD rental and pay-TV companies potential revenues, while collecting money from adverts placed on the site. All are necessary elements of a \"conspiracy to defraud\" case.</p> <p>Among the titles that were up early \u2014 in some cases simultaneously as the doors opened at cinemas \u2014 were films such as Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and Prince Caspian. Fact argued in court that the millions of links and visitors, and the length of time that Surfthechannel operated, meant between \u00a352m and \u00a3198m of lost revenues, based on the provision of access to the top 50 films over the indictment period, tallied with the idea that 55% of those who went to the site would have bought the film in some way instead.</p> <p>Judge John Evans put the case against linking sites more succinctly: \"If the producers are unable to exploit the product in which they have invested, then almost certainly the film will not make a profit. Whether made by the major film studios or the smaller production companies, if films fail to make a profit or at the very least break even, then the incentive to produce films diminishes and with it goes what has been a major source of entertainment to millions worldwide for over a century.\" That, in a nutshell, sums up the content wars: producers who want to set a price, against consumers who also want to set a price \u2013 ideally, zero.</p> <p>\"For the CPS, it means they can feel that even if they don't pursue a case then they can rely on a private prosecution by someone like Fact,\" says Luke Scanlon, an intellectual property lawyer at Pinsent Masons. \"But you do have to wonder about the data protection implications. The police arrest the guy, and then they hand over private data about him to Fact because it's mounting a private prosecution? That's surprising.\"</p> <p>For Vickerman, the latest casualty in the content wars, it won't be any comfort to know that he has been doubly precedent-setting.</p>",
  "<p>Google's chairman, Eric Schmidt, had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2011/aug/27/eric-schmidt-mactaggart-lecture\" title=\"\">just delivered the prestigious MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh</a> when some of the media's biggest brains were invited to put a question to one of the biggest of them all.</p> <p>Ash Atalla, former producer of The Office, had a query. Would the internet break, he asked, if you typed Google into Google?</p> <p>Schmidt's answer was as deadpan as it was (presumably unintentionally) hilarious. \"That's an example in computer science of recursion,\" he told the audience. \"And the answer is 'no'.\" So now we knew.</p> <p>Atalla describes himself as a \"low-level, ineffectual trouble-maker \u2026 I'm happy to operate on that level,\" he says. \"I need something to push against all the time. Sometimes I have to create a false enemy in my mind to keep myself interested in things.\"</p> <p>Atalla went on to make Graham Linehan's The IT Crowd for Channel 4 and other shows including the science spoof Look Around You and the sketch show Man Stroke Woman, before setting up his own company, <a href=\"http://www.roughcut-tv.com/Programmes_Trollied.html\" title=\"\">Roughcut Television</a>, currently producing the Sky1 sitcom Trollied.</p> <p>His sitcoms were described by one critic as \"a slightly edgy look at the utterly commonplace\". It is an apt take on Trollied, a supermarket-set comedy starring Jane Horrocks and Mark Addy, which Sky recommissioned for another 26 episodes (starting later this month) after a successful first run.</p> <p>\"It's not the only thing I like to look at but I'm fascinated by the ordinary,\" says Atalla. \"It's quite hard to do the ordinary well. It's like real life but funny, but it can't be too funny because then you break the reality of it. Sometimes you have to cut your funny stuff.\"</p> <p>Other Roughcut shows include <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p00v5jj0/People_Just_Do_Nothing/\" title=\"\">People Just Do Nothing</a>, a mockumentary comedy about a pirate radio station that was shown on Friday on BBC3; Anna &amp; Katy, a sketch show for Channel 4 with Anna Crilly and Katy Wix; and the BBC3 sitcom Cuckoo, which will star Greg Davies and Helen Baxendale as a couple who are horrified when their daughter marries a self-appointed spiritual ninja, played by Saturday Night Live's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/jun/13/andy-samberg-boy-deserves-do-good\" title=\"\">Andy Samberg</a>.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/comedy-showcase/episode-guide/series-15/episode-1\" title=\"\">Fun Police</a>, starring Vic Reeves and Flight of the Conchords' Rhys Darby, set in a council's health and safety department, was not picked up by Channel 4 after being piloted as part of its <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/comedy-showcase/episode-guide\" title=\"\">Comedy Showcase</a> season last year.</p> <p>\"It got turned down by Channel 4 but I just adore it,\" says Atalla. \"It's a slightly hackneyed mantra from comedy producers that things need a little bit of time. I'm pretty sure the biggest successes I have had in my career would have been killed by research at the pilot stage.</p> <p>\"I'm not of the generation that says all research is hokum, but I have to combine it with my own instincts, and sometimes I feel like Rambo in the woods: they are all wrong, everyone is wrong!\"</p> <p>Atalla is keen to take the comedy elsewhere, including the US, where Roughcut has just signed a first-look deal with Lionsgate Television, producer of Mad Men and The Hunger Games. \"We're developing shows from London directly for America,\" he says. \"Lionsgate is a kindred spirit.\"</p> <p>It is 11 years since the first series of The Office, the show that Atalla championed when it was still a short film based on the \"sleazy boss\" character Ricky Gervais had developed while he was working at the London radio station Xfm.</p> <p>When he was first told about The Office's Golden Globes nominations Atalla emailed back: \"Brilliant. What are the Golden Globes?\"</p> <p>\"Everything that's good that's happened in my career came from that moment,\" says Atalla. \"I hope I have moved on. After I did The Office I did The IT Crowd, which was right in the other corner of the ring, it was knockabout, stupid and about as unnaturalistic as you could get.\"</p> <p>If The Office turned Gervais into a national treasure, then more recently he has been its wind-up merchant in chief, dividing opinion with BBC2's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b017cj76\" title=\"\">Life's Too Short</a> (and Channel 4's Derek) and prompting occasional outrage on Twitter.</p> <p>Atalla declines to comment on Gervais, but addresses the point more generally. \"I think there's a misconception when people say the job of comedy is to push boundaries,\" he says. \"I disagree \u2013 the job of comedy is to make people laugh.

  "<p>Shell is paying Nigerian security forces tens of millions of dollars a year to guard their installations and staff in the Niger delta, according to leaked internal financial data seen by the Guardian. The oil giant also maintains a 1,200-strong internal police force in Nigeria, plus a network of plainclothes informants.</p> <p>According to the data, the world's largest company by revenue spent nearly $1bn on worldwide security between 2007-09: if it were a country Shell would have the third highest security budget in Africa, after South Africa and Nigeria itself.</p> <p>The documents show that nearly 40% of Shell's total security expenditure over the three year period \u2013 $383m (\u00a3244m) \u2013 was spent on protecting its staff and installations in Nigeria's volatile Niger delta region. In 2009, $65m was spent on Nigerian government forces and $75m on \"other\" security costs \u2013 believed to be a mixture of private security firms and payments to individuals.</p> <p>Activists expressed concern that the escalating cost of Shell's security operation in the delta was further destabilising the oil rich region and helping to fuel rampant corruption and criminality. \"The scale of Shell's global security expenditure is colossal,\" said Ben Amunwa of London-based oil watchdog Platform. \"It is staggering that Shell transferred $65m of company funds and resources into the hands of soldiers and police known for routine human rights abuses.\"</p> <p>The financial documents, <a href=\"http://t.co/fHAITY4j\">passed to Platform</a>, suggest Shell's worldwide security costs almost doubled between 2007-2009, coinciding with the rise of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/10/oil.world\" title=\"\">armed insurgency in the Niger delta</a>.</p> <p>In 2008, 62 Shell employees or contractors were kidnapped and three killed, many Shell-operated pipelines, well heads and offshore oil platforms were attacked and the company was forced to halt oil exports for several weeks after attacks by groups including the Movement for the emancipation of the Niger delta.</p> <p>Nearly a third of Shell's global security budget in 2008, or $99m, was spent on \"third parties\". This was double what the company spent on its own security staff and is believed to include the services of 600 Nigerian government police and 700 members of the controversial state \"joint task force\" (JTF) comprised of army, navy and police.</p> <p>Shell denies having any direct control over JTF forces, amid <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/21/hundreds-killed-niger-delta\" title=\"\">numerous accusations of human rights abuses</a>, including a large-scale military attack in 2009 which the US state department said led to the displacement and loss of livelihood of tens of thousands of residents.</p> <p>But in the past Shell has supplied government forces with gunboats, helicopters, vehicles and satellite phones to better patrol the myriad creeks and waterways of the delta.</p> <p>\"This proves what we in the Niger delta have known for years \u2013 that the air force, the army, the police, they are paid for with Shell money and they are all at the disposal of the company for it to use it any how it likes,\" said Celestine Nkabari at the Niger delta campaign group Social Action.</p> <p>According to Platform, a significant amount of Shell funding is channelled via senior military officials which provides \"ample opportunities for corruption\". US cables, released by WikiLeaks in 2010, alleged that the company paid hundreds of thousands of pounds towards the deployment of 350 soldiers in the delta in 2003.</p> <p>But Shell International said that any allegations of corruption should be addressed to the Nigerian authorities, and that its spending is necessary to protect its staff and operations.</p> <p>Although armed insurgency in the oil producing regions of the delta has declined since a 2009 amnesty, the company says it faces widespread criminality, organised crime and massive oil theft. It has stated that 15-20% of its output is stolen by international gangs.</p> <p>\"Protecting our people and our assets is Shell's highest priority,\" it said. \"Our spending on security is carefully judged to meet this objective, wherever we operate in the world. We have always acknowledged the difficulties of working in countries like Nigeria. In the period that this report refers to, the armed militancy in the Niger delta was at its height, requiring a relatively high level of security spending there.</p> <p>\"All our staff and contractors are expected to adhere to the highest levels of personal and corporate ethics, as set out in our code of conduct. We support the Voluntary principles on security and human rights (VPSHR), and we recognise that these principles help maintain the safety and security of our operations in a manner consistent with upholding human rights. We also investigate grievances under the VPSHR.\"</p> <p>The company declined to comment on whether worldwide costs for security were increasing because of the Arab spring. The company has recently left Syria and has interests throughout the Middle East.</p> <p>But the scale of Shell's spending, revealed by the data for the first time, raises questions about the effectiveness of its security policies. \"What is striking about the amount being spent in Nigeria is its ineffectiveness,\" said Amunwa. \"Shell spent many millions of dollars each year on government forces who failed to provide the company with adequate security.\"</p> <p>Nkabari said: \"Shell cannot call this spending 'security'. If it was really providing security, then why do we continue to have vandalisation, why do we have bunkering [theft of oil], why do we have the security mess that we have in the Niger delta? They give protection to the oil workers but they are not providing the region with 'security'.\"</p> <p>\"These figures are alarming \u2013 it is a scandal that so much money is spent on security instead of on the local communities whose livelihoods are destroyed as a result of the oil exploitation,\" said Jaff Napoleon Bamenjo of Relufa, which campaigns for environmental justice in west Africa.</p> <p>\"Across Africa oil, mining and agro-industry companies regularly pay for the services of local security forces that have deplorable human rights records; sometimes as a contractual obligation,\" said Bamenjo. \"This is an extremely unethical practice held over from the colonial era which must end immediately. Not only is it bad for local communities who are the primary victims of police and military predation, but as Shell well knows, it exposes foreign companies to lawsuits in multiple jurisdictions.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lanai, a tiny resort island in Hawaii, has 18 miles of secluded beaches, no traffic lights and a population of just over 3,000. This summer, Larry Ellison, the CEO of Oracle, a California-based software company, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2012/06/21/larry-ellison-hawaii-lanai-island-david-murdock-dole/\">bought 98% of the island for a sum reported to exceed $500m</a>. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://WWW.IPS-DC.ORG\">Institute for Policy Studies, a Washington DC thinktank</a>, says that a chunk of the money Ellison spent buying Lanai should have paid for elementary school teachers and clean energy jobs, instead of fulfilling the billionaire CEO's vacation fantasies. That's one conclusion of their <a href=\"http://www.ips-dc.org/reports/executive_excess_2012\">new report, \"The CEO Hands in Uncle Sam's Pocket: How Our Tax Dollars Subsidize Exorbitant Executive Pay\"</a>, which points out that Oracle took advantage of a 1993 loophole in tax law to designate $76m of Ellison's income as \"performance-related pay\", which allowed him to avoid paying any taxes on the money.</p> <p>Dozens of US CEOs have cashed in on this major tax incentive at an estimated cost to US taxpayers of $9.7bn last year. <a href=\"http://nationalpriorities.org/en/interactive-data/tradeoffs/state/US/program/20/tradeoff/0/\">Statistics provided by National Priorities Project suggest</a> that the same amount of money could have paid for 142,625 elementary school teachers, or healthcare for 4.96 million low-income children.</p> <p>\"At a time of austerity, it's beyond absurd that billions of our tax dollars are pouring into executive pockets,\" says Sarah Anderson, a report co-author.</p> <p>In 1980, the average US CEO was paid 42 times as much as the average worker when tax rates for the richest stood at 70%. Today, that ratio has widened to 380 times \u2013 exacerbated in part, no doubt, by the fact that CEOs are able to dramatically reduce their tax burdens by a reduction in top tax rates, as well as several new loopholes introduced in recent years.</p> <p>In fact, some companies paid their CEOs more money than they paid in taxes. Take Aubrey McClendon, CEO of Oklahoma-based Chesapeake Energy, who was paid $17.9m in 2011, while his company gave Uncle Sam just $13m on sales of $11.64bn.</p> <p>Chesapeake achieved this startlingly low tax liability by claiming a \"drilling-costs tax benefit\" that allows generous income tax deferrals in case an oil well comes up dry. Yet, this decades-old tax incentive to encourage oil companies to prospect far and wide is now largely irrelevant since sophisticated technologies allow them to accurately gauge where to drill.</p> <p>\"McClendon's primary goal is not to solve America's energy problems, but to build a pipeline directly from your wallet into his,\" <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-big-fracking-bubble-the-scam-behind-the-gas-boom-20120301\">writes Jeff Goodell of Rolling Stone this past March</a>, describing the CEO as \"a rightwing billionaire who profits more from flipping land than drilling for gas\".</p> <p>McClendon is not alone. The Institute for Policy Studies found that 26 of the 100 highest-paid US CEOs took home more in pay than their companies paid in federal income taxes. On average, each of these company bosses was paid $20.4m last year.</p> <p>Another scam that CEOs pull on the taxpayer is called \"deferred compensation\". The way that works is simple \u2013 most taxpayers are expected to pay 35% of their income in taxes the year they earn it. But a CEO does not have to pay the tax until they claim the cash which can be earning interest in the mean time. Depending on how the money is invested, CEOs can engineer a substantial profit.</p> <p>This allowed Michael Duke, CEO of Walmart, to sock away $17,028,615 tax free in 2011, roughly 774 times more than one of his employees would have been allowed to do under normal tax rules.</p> <p>Yet the money these CEOs makes shrinks into insignificance compared to the money that hedge fund managers make. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mdg45ghlg/ray-dalio-2/\">Take Raymond Dalio</a>, who was paid an astronomical $3bn in 2011. This titan of Wall Street had to pay just 15% in taxes because the money was considered \"capital gains\", as opposed to the average citizen who would be required to pay 25% (in income tax). Cost to the taxpayer in 2011: $450m.</p> <p>\"Some tax breaks do have a redeeming social value. Most don't,\" write report authors Sarah Anderson, Chuck Collins, Scott Klinger and Sam Pizzigati.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"In fact, most create incentives for things companies would have done anyway or reward corporate behaviors that deserve no encouragement from taxpayers, especially at a time of fiscal crisis.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The report proves the case made by thousands of protesters who took to the streets last September as part of the Occupy movement, and that of <a href=\"http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=15743\">investors who stormed annual meetings this year</a> as part of the \"Shareholder Spring\" to reclaim enterprises from many overpaid CEOs.</p> <p>The authors of the new report have an even better solution: make these executives pay their fair share of taxes, just like the rest of us.</p>",
  "<p>One in four senior military and civilian staff at the Ministry of Defence are to be axed over the next two years, the defence secretary, Philip Hammond, has said.</p> <p>A new senior structure for the ministry will be introduced next year in an attempt to show that all ranks of the services are making savings, and the cuts are not falling disproportionately on serving lower ranks.</p> <p>\"At a time when we are making difficult decisions about defence spending and have had to accept reductions across the board, we cannot ignore the volume of posts at the top,\" said Hammond. \"For too long the MoD has been top heavy, with too many senior civilians and military.\"</p> <p>In July, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/05/army-lose-17-units-cuts\" title=\"\">Hammond announced </a>that 17 units were to be axed from the British army as part of sweeping reforms that will reduce its overall strength by 20,000.

Strangely symmetrical pics in the redtops showed five jumping figures, female in the Sun and male in the Daily Mirror, with two bared belly-buttons apiece \u2013 but no blonds of either sex. The Daily Telegraph, where blond tresses and jumping are normally de rigueur, eschewed group shots altogether, while the Daily Mail had seven lads posing as Usain Bolt. Even the reliably time-warped Daily Express joined the anti-blond trend, though it did have four female jumpers.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <h2>Manchester City v Southampton preview</h2> <p>Southampton can take immense pride in the consecutive promotions with which Nigel Adkins has restored the club to the top flight, <em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/17/squad-sheets-manchester-city-southampton\">wrote Kevin McCarra in yesterday's Guardian</a></em>, but this game might be seen as a trial for a club that has come so far so soon. It would be a surprise if Manchester City did not revel in the occasion at the Etihad Stadium. The manager, Roberto Mancini, seemed frustrated this summer by a halt to the large-scale recruitment policy of the past, but a settled squad may be formidable as players improve their rapport with one another.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> The last time we saw Southampton in the Premier League, a second-half Ruud van Nistelrooy goal scuppered their hopes of avoiding relegation (well, that and the two scored by Geoff Horfield and Kieran Richardson, which made West Brom safe); Rupert Lowe attempted to defend his reign to protestors by highlighting the quality of the catering at St Mary's; and Harry Redknapp promised that if he left the club it would be to retire, not to mosey back to Portsmouth having made up his differences with Milan Mandaric. But enough nostalgia! Today Nigel Adkins's side is here on a tailwind after two successive promotions and the club is about to break its transfer record for the second time this summer with the signing of Bologna's Gaston Ramirez. The money could perhaps do with being spent at the back, however - Southampton were pretty sound last season, but there isn't much pressure on Jose Fonte's place and that 4-0 pre-season defeat to Udinese will feel rather more ominous given that the season starts against Manchester City.</p> <p>The last time we saw City in the Premier League, of course, they were busy winning it. Really busy. Roberto Mancini's side didn't let QPR touch the ball in the final 45 minutes of last season but took until stoppage time to score the decisive goals - one either side of the whistle blowing on Manchester United's 1-0 win over Sunderland. United finished their match top of the table but were bumped down to second before they could get to the dressing room and crack open the T-shirts. Now Mancini and Sir Alex Ferguson are arguing about which of the two teams has the best chance of taking this year's title (\"No, <em>you're</em> squad is peachiest\" - we're about three days from FACTS if things carry on as they are), but with United playing Everton tomorrow, City must admit to having the \"easier\" start. True, they're in unfamiliar territory just as Southampton are, having a title to defend for the first time since the 68-69 season. And true, they've no firm idea of their opponents, prompting Mancini to remind everyone that it took City almost an hour to get going against newcomers Swansea at this point last season, but it's probably the next bit of his sentence that we should pay attention to: \"We might have won that game 4-0 in the end, but...\"</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Team news:</strong> <br>Manchester City (apparently abandoning 3-5-2 for 4-4-2): Hart, Zabaleta, Kompany, Lescott, Clichy, Toure, Rodwell, Silva, Nasri, Tevez, Aguero. </p> <p>Southampton (apparently abandoning common sense): Davis, Clyne, Fonte, Hooiveld, Fox, Ward-Prowse, Schneiderlin, Lallana, Puncheon, Guly, Rodriguez.</p> <p>So no Rickie Lambert or Billy Sharp for Southampton, with Guly do Prado preferred up front with the new boy Jay Rodriguez and Jason Puncheon.

Today we're presented with different challenges; Guly's done well in pre-season... and what great players to bring off the bench.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>4 minutes and 35 seconds before kick off</strong> - the timing of the first mention of Robin van Persie.

A prize* to the first person who manages to get something interesting and/or funny through the Automated Random Email Bouncer.</p> <p>* <em>There is no prize except pride</em></p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>Kick off</strong> After a high-tempo chorus of Blue Moon, Howard Webb's Howard Webb blows his whistle to get the game underway, the ball rolling from the toe of Aguero to Tevez, today sporting a turned up collar. City wear their pale blue home kit, Southampton are in all-red.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>1 min</strong> David Silva is removed from the pitch because the tape around his ankles does not match the blue of his socks. Oh football.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>2 min</strong> Rodwell gets the first applause of the afternoon, sliding in to clear the ball from Lallana's feet after the Southampton winger had beaten Kompany. Southampton don't manage to get the corner into the box, though, and City move as one towards the other end of the pitch.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>5 min</strong> A lively, bustling start from Southampton, this, and they've probed down both flanks to see what mischief they might be able to make. Guly is halted just as he tries to work in from the right, though, and City are only halted by the offside flag, held up to signal that Tevez had gone too early. It was a well-directed early pass from Kompany, and one that would have presented Southampton with problems had Tevez waited a second.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>8 min</strong> Clyne makes a good tackle to dispossess Aguero, running down City's left, but he catches the City forward's leg under him as they both slide across the turf, and Aguero seems to have twisted his knee - he looks in real pain, and tenses as the physios try to manipulate it. Mario Balotelli is warming up.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>11 min</strong> Aguero is up and hobbling towards the sideline, booed by the Southampton fans and raucously cheered by his own. \"I've never actually watched Nathaniel Clyne play \"real\" football before, but I do know that he develops into a world class, marauding right back in Fifa 12 Manager mode,\" guffaws Dan Schulwolf. I said there would be pride, I didn't say the bar would be set high.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>13 min</strong> Schneiderlin's shot from just outside the area never really looked like it would trouble Hart's goal without the interference of a crease in the Etihad turf, but Southampton are upset not to have been given a free-kick for Lescott's scything tackle on Rodriguez, who turned nicely after Guly's slaloming run on the right. Aguero is being stretchered off, and it's Edin Dzeko coming on in his place.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>15 min</strong> A chance at the other end as Dzeko sneaks between two defenders and gets the ball in behind them, but the Southampton defence recovers in time to block his effort and Silva's follow-up. Moments later Zabaleta strokes a shot goalwards and it's deflected across goal, but cleared.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>16 min PENALTY for City!</strong> Hooiveld points to the ball but it's not clear why - it is busy bimbling over the byline while Tevez, with whom he actually did make contact, is lying on the floor in the area.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>17 min MISSED PENALTY for City!</strong> What an abysmal effort by Silva, virtually bobbling across the turf and straight to Kelvin Davis, who went the right way but probably had time to go the wrong way and get back again to save that.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>20 min</strong> Tevez is weaving those little trails around the penalty box that lend you to thinking that a goal is only a matter of time. He doesn't quite manage to combined with Zabaleta this time, but the No5 is pretty much camped on his shoulder.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>22 min</strong> City are having more of the ball, but are currently trapped between the halfway line and the edge of Southampton's area. \"Why can't they use clear tape on their socks???\" Andrew Goudie demands to know - look, there are three question marks and everything. I think we all know that this merely presents the clubs with an additional branding opportunity.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>25 min</strong> Dzeko and Silva try to Arsenal the ball through about eight Southampton players camped just inside the penalty box, which ends with the latter on his backside and the ball being hoofed away. I'm not sure there was a shot on, really, but they were never going to thread the ball through that tangle of legs.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>29 min</strong> We're just under halfway in and it's probably just about legitimate to start asking whether Southampton will have the energy for this in the second half. City are dictating things all over the pitch, with Tevez, Silva and Zabaleta combining well down the right. Tevez's cross from that area was destined for the forehead of Dzeko until Fonte's leap enables him to intercept and send it skimming over everybody.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>31 min</strong> City make down the left this time, Clichy swinging a cross in for Fonte to clear. Nasri's corner swooshes behind everyone in the penalty area though, and the home side have to work from the beginning again. Southampton have retreated somewhat, with only Guly beyond the centre circle.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>32 min</strong> I'll mention that Tevez shot, as it's the done thing, but Davis probably wasn't that worried about it. There was a moment of high excitement as Tevez ran on to the ball in the D, but he hit it straight at the Southampton keeper.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>35 min</strong> Toure is penalised for a clunking tackle from behind, giving Southampton a free-kick a few yards inside City's half - they try to work it goalwards, though, and come unstuck about two passes forward. A moment later Lallana launches a cross in from the left which Zabaleta handles; this free-kick will definitely be launched into the area.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>36 min</strong> Nasri heads the free-kick out for a corner,but Hooiveld and Rodriguez both go for it and end up getting in each other's way. Somewhere in the Sky studio, they'll-have-to-make-the-most-of-those-chances is being saddled up and given a palm full of sugar cubes.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>39 min</strong> We're still stuck on David Silva's socks. \"How many managers are now wondering if they can have him removed from the pitch as his name doesn't match the rest of his kit?\" puns Phil.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>40 min GOAL! Tevez!</strong> Finally a pass that penetrates the Southampton lines, Nasri taking a moment to assess the situation and then stroking the ball with his instep for Tevez, who takes one look at Davis and then slides the ball in close to the near post. There's a suspicion of offside, there, but Gary Neville says Clyne was playing Tevez on, and I'm not arguing with that haircut.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>44 min</strong> A disappointing way for Southampton to concede, that: it's almost half time and even if Tevez was offside, Davis will surely feel he should have done better with a shot that wasn't far from him. He manages to block and then gather Dzeko's shot, hit as he slid to the ground trying to turn his man, mind.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>45 +2 min</strong> The board says four minutes of added time, accounted for by Aguero's injury. City look in the mood to keep the ball for that entire time, Zabaleta sticking to his role as an auxiliary winger and zipping the ball across the area to Nasri to set off a string of passes that weave backwards and forwards across the penalty box. Davis makes a good block but can't scoop the ball up and it's stabbed back to Silva, but his shot is blocked at source.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>Half time</strong> There's a hint of a young Steven Gerrard in full Roy of the Rovers mode about Lallana as he strides up through the middle, hoping that gravitational pull might bring his teammates with him, but he's forced to pass backwards and the half ends with a looping ball forward bouncing in to Hart's palms.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Half time nonsense (not the same as in-play nonsense)</strong><br>\"Please give us a shout-out in the MBM,\" beg Alison Walters and Chris Mulligan, English ex-pats in Washington DC. \"After being forced to watch Euro 2012 <em>and</em> the Olympics on US television, we are now sorely missing home coverage. We're even missing Alan Shearer on Match of the Day.\" Hand yourselves in to your nearest embassy immediately.</p> <p>What's the best dunking biscuit? I find two small biscuits sandwiched around some buttercream makes for a good dunking experience, though digestives are an obvious choice to withstand high temperatures. Has anyone ever successfully dunked with oaty ones?</p> <p>Nathan Paterson has a slightly more important question: \"Was Tevez booked for his celebration [lifting his shirt to reveal a message] or does this not happen anymore?\" He wasn't booked, but I don't know if that's because of a rule change or just that Webb missed it. That's certainly possible - Tevez only lifted his shirt as you do when you get home after a particularly sweaty car journey, not over his face.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>46 min</strong> Guly and Lallana kick off the second half, Southampton playing from left to right and looking for a goal to draw them level.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>48 min</strong> Geoff Shreeves reports that City are cautiously optimistic about Aguero's injury, before heading off to tell Aguero that his goatee looks rubbish, just to level things up. \"I've always found ginger nuts work pretty well for dunking,\" says Jamie Tucker. \"Not only do they not fall apart, but they genuinely taste much better once laden with tea (and I quite like them anyway).\" They do, don't they? \"Can't say they work so well with coffee, mind.\" You'd be hard pressed to find many biscuits that work well with coffee.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>50 min</strong> Almost a second for City! Nasri twisted and turned to shrug off the attentions of Clyne, who kept coming back until eventually he got too dizzy and fell over, giving Nasri the chance to poke the ball along the byline and then ping it back to Dzeko. There's a suggestion that he wasn't expecting the ball, thus explaining the poor touch that goes straight to Davis, but the replay seems to show that he steadied himself for a shot and just miscued the contact.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>52 min</strong> Oof, Toure's arrived for the season ladies and gentleman, chipping a cute pass up and over to Clichy, who shoots with his first touch but can't find the target. \"Bourbons,\" Tweets Mike Gibbons. \"Accept no substitute.\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>54 min</strong> Puncheon - back on his own byline - loses control of the ball to concede a corner, from which most of the crowd shouts for a handball as a Zabaleta's shot is blocked. We've had no replays so I'm not sure, but everyone seems to have gotten over it quite quickly.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>55 min </strong>Silva hits the bar! What a chance. Tevez charges down the right again, beating Fox and whipping the ball in to the middle. Davis chooses to punch it away when he probably could have caught it - or at least pushed it away from danger - allowing Nasri the chance to pop it back in for Silva. He hits it first time but the ball pings up off the bar.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>57 min</strong> Puncheon works an opening from the right and manages to find Lallana, but the ball is slightly behind him; the subsequent effort slightly wide.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>59 min GOAL! Lambert comes on for Southampton and equalises!</strong> That was very nicely struck by a player who'd been on about two minutes. Guly had an effort blocked but City could not clear the ball out of their area properly, and Lambert enjoyed a time-slowing-down moment as the ball came across the penalty area to him, sweeping it beyond Hart with his right boot.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>62 min</strong> Everything has become a bit noisier at the Etihad since that goal, the home fans urging their players to do something with the ball that they're still seeing so much of. Lambert replaced Rodriguez, by the way.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>65 min</strong> Ward-Prowse is replaced by Steven Davis, a free transfer from Rangers. \"Hob Knobs,\" says Liam Meehan - I think we're still talking about biscuits. Ah, yes. \"Great solidity post-dunk, great aftertaste/texture. Also something to laugh at, then chastise yourself maturely.\"</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>68 min GOAL! Davis for Southampton!</strong> Schneiderlin concedes a free-kick about 28 yards out, for coming through the back of someone in blue. Tevez takes it after staring his best hard stare at Kelvin Davis, but he hits it straight in to the wall, and Southampton break from the resulting corner thanks to a terrible pass from Rodwell. Lallana was stopped by Lescott in the area, but kept the ball and turned to lay it off to Steven Davis, who puts it into the bottom-right corner with a low drive. Both subs have scored within moments of coming on. Nigel Adkins: tactical genius.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>70 min</strong> What a start to life in the Premier League for Southampton; it would seem rather silly to be talking about biscuits while this is going on. \"Here's a tip for discerning mbm readers,\" says Gavin Digby. \"Cadburys chocolate fingers: bite off each end and use them as a straw to suck up the tea. Although maybe not that socially acceptable, they are delicious.\"</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>72 min GOAL! Dzeko draws City level!</strong> This game is scarily similar to the final day of last season. Edin Dzeko has just levelled things up, poking the ball up into the net after Kompany's effort was blocked and deflected to him. Southampton attack from the restart, having two shots blocked, and then City break and Balotelli shoots in to the side-netting from about eight yards out on the left. This is cup final football!</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>75 min</strong> Stand up for the champions, shout the home fans. Southampton must be tiring now but they have a quarter of an hour to play and a Toure free-kick to defend - Davis again bats the ball out in front of him, diving to his right to keep the ball out of his goal, and Silva is crowded out of getting anything on the rebound.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>78 min</strong> Dzeko's header has just gone about a yard wide - close enough to have the crowd on their feet and Gary Neville's voice wobbling up the octaves. \"Chocolate fingers as straws are all very well,\" says Adam Fletcher, \"but the real deal is using fingers of Twix - you know you wanna.\"</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>79 min GOAL! Nasri gives City the lead!</strong> A superb cross by Clichy from the left sets that up, Fox backpedalling to get his head to it by the far post and managing only to knock it down for Nasri rather than lifting it clear. Nasri, who has been excellent today, strikes it in to the ground and zipping up into the net. He lifts his shirt over his head to reveal 'Eid Mubarak' - I didn't see a card come out. </p> <p>You know how when you chuckle when you're really excited - meeting Su Pollard, say - and it comes out like a little seal bark? Neville's just done that. What a game this is.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>83 min</strong> The away fans are going to have sore throats in the morning! Guly should do better than a thump-it-and-hope effort at a crowded penalty area, but the ball rebounds to a Southampton player - Lallana I think - who lays it back to Schneiderlin. His shot is deflected wide and from the corner, Lambert shoots over. It's a tough shot that he's got to hit first time, from slightly behind him.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>85 min</strong> Puncheon is subbed off and replaced by Billy Sharp. Can Southampton pull that trick off a third time? \"When it comes to dunking, shortcake are the Lionel Messi of the biscuit world.\" You are so right, Justin Kavanagh. A tin of shortcake is what makes Christmas with the family worth doing.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>87 min</strong> Lambert, coming down the left, floats the ball over the penalty area to Sharp, whose shot is blocked. Guly swipes at the rebound but makes a holy hash of it. Tevez is replaced by Kolarov.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>90 min</strong> City have stepped back from this game a little bit in the last couple of minutes, letting Southampton have the ball. Eventually Lallana has to try and get past Zabaleta, though, and it's not happening. Sharp manages to find space to get a cross off, but it's hoofed clear. There are three added minutes for Southampton to find an equaliser.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>92 min</strong> Mancini orchestrated all this to prove a point to Ferguson.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>Full time</strong> City end the game pinging one-touch passes around, but this has been a testing game for them - a second half that could as easily have gone awry as give the champions an opening victory. Nigel Adkins will be very pleased with Southampton's performance, and in particular the impact that his substitutes had. Mancini looks like his cookie has just sunk to the bottom a nice hot cup of earl grey, but he will take that. City looked very good, and the interplay between the front six was generally slick - Nasri, who was limping slightly at the end of the game, would be my player of the match. I'd best be off now. Thanks for joining me.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&amp;VF=MAGO31_9_VForm&amp;ERID=24KL535XVA\" title=\"Magnum Photos profile of Martine Franck\">Martine Franck</a>, who has died aged 74, was a photographer of great contrasts. She started out by taking pictures in Asia, a continent she revisited for weeks at a time, but she also devoted herself to documenting daily life close to her homes in Paris and the Luberon, Provence. Her work is characterised by a fascination with the little intimacies and interactions in the lives of anonymous poor, marginalised and elderly people, yet she also assembled a matchless portfolio of portraits of famous authors and artists, including <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=SearchResult&amp;STID=2S5RYD19OIQ\" title=\"Martine Franck's photos of Seamus Heaney\">Seamus Heaney</a>, <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=SearchResult&amp;STID=2S5RYDZMLW9T\" title=\"Martine Franck's photos of Marc Chagall\">Marc Chagall</a> and <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=SearchResult&amp;STID=2S5RYDLXBZH\" title=\"Martine Franck's portraits of Diego Giacometti\">Diego Giacometti</a>.</p> <p>Franck never adhered to the opinion professed by her fellow Magnum agency photographer <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/jan/05/eve-arnold\" title=\"Eve Arnold obituary\">Eve Arnold</a> that all photographers are obliged to be intrusive. Ever modest, she said: \"I think I was shy as a young woman and realised that photography was an ideal way of expressing myself, of telling people what was going on without having to talk.\" In 1970, she married the celebrated French photographer and co-founder of the Magnum agency, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2004/aug/05/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Henri Cartier-Bresson</a>. The couple collaborated on a series of portraits of the artist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2001/feb/19/guardianobituaries2\" title=\"\">Balthus</a>, as retiring by temperament as Franck herself.</p> <p>She was born to a Belgian banker, Louis Franck, and his British wife, Evelyn, in Antwerp. With the outbreak of hostilities in 1939, her father, who made his career in London, joined the British army. The rest of the family was evacuated to the US and spent the war on Long Island and in Arizona. She was educated in Europe, and studied history of art at Madrid University and the Ecole du Louvre in Paris.</p> <p>Writing her thesis (on Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and the influence of cubism on sculpture) convinced Franck that she did not wish to be an academic or a curator, but a photographer. Her father had moved in artistic circles and one of her first portraits was of the sculptor Etienne Martin emerging from a cave smeared with clay. In 1963, she went to China, taking her cousin's Leica camera with her, and discovered the joys of documenting other cultures. Returning home via Hong Kong, Cambodia, India, Afghanistan and Turkey, she paused to visit the theatre director Ariane Mnouchkine and bought her first camera in Japan. She kept to a Leica, and predominantly used black-and-white film, throughout her career.</p> <p>Returning to France, she worked as a photographic assistant at Time-Life while developing her own technique. Her early mentors were Eliot Elisofon and Gjon Mili, yet she also cited dramatically different female photographers as influences: Julia Margaret Cameron, for her portraits, and Dorothea Lange and Margaret Bourke-White. Lange's social conscience was reflected in Franck's project on old people's homes for the Petits Fr\u00e8res des Pauvres association. Bourke-White's love for play of light and geometric shapes is embedded in arguably Franck's single most perfect image, that of the <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=SearchResult&amp;ALID=2TYRYDIWIF08\" title=\"Martine Franck's photograph of bathers at the poolside at Le Brusc\">bathers at the poolside at Le Brusc</a>, Provence, taken in 1976. She described her experience of capturing it: \"I remember running to get the image while changing the film, quickly closing down the lens as the sunlight was so intense. That's what makes photography so exciting.\" A moment later the positions of all five figures and their shadows on the white tiles would have irrevocably altered. The image has stood the test of time and was used as the cover shot for her book in the series I Grandi Fotografi in 2003.</p> <p>Franck's work was used in Life, Fortune and Vogue, for which she shot portraits of women in public life, including her fellow photographer Sarah Moon and Mnouchkine, who made Franck the official photographer to her <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&amp;VF=MAGO31_10_VForm&amp;ERID=24KL535XVA\" title=\"Magnum: Thtre du Soleil photos by Franck\">Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil</a>. Franck's fascination with masks and disguises found an outlet in Mnouchkine's ambitious deployment of kathakali, kabuki and commedia dell'arte. Their collaboration led to Franck experimenting with colour photography, which she used to capture theatrical productions such as Robert Wilson's ethereal version of Fables de la Fontaine at the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise in 2004. Franck's love of the theatrical could transform her quiet unobtrusiveness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394920145\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/19/1345392377770/Tulku-Khentrul-Lodro-Rabs-003.jpg\" alt=\"Tulku Khentrul Lodro Rabsel, 12\" width=\"480\" height=\"340\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tulku Khentrul Lodro Rabsel, 12, with his tutor in a Nepalese monastery taken by Franck in 1996.

Franck was adamant that she would neither bask in his reflection nor disappear in his shadow and she joined the Vu agency in 1970. Her first solo exhibition was planned for the ICA in London that year; when she saw that the invitations were embossed with the information that her husband would be present at the launch, she cancelled the show.</p> <p>With Vu's demise, Franck co-founded the Viva agency in 1972. It also collapsed and it was not until 1980 that Franck joined <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP=XSpecific_MAG.Biography_VPage&amp;AID=2K7O3R14HF4K\" title=\"Magnum: Franck's biography\">Magnum</a>, becoming a full member in 1983. She was one of the few women to be accepted into the agency and served as vice-president from 1998 to 2000. Eschewing the war/human tragedy reportage that characterised Magnum's reputation, Franck continued her projects on marginal or isolated lives. When I first met her, in the 1990s, she had just completed her book on Tory Island, a \"small rock\" off the northern Irish coast with a population of around 130 Gaelic-speakers, where she lived in order to document their way of life.</p> <p>Always a feminist, Franck was not above picking a grandiose book title \u2013 such as <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=SearchResult&amp;ALID=2TYRYDIWVYUQ\" title=\"Des Femmes et la Cration photos by Martine Franck\">Des Femmes et la Cr\u00e9ation</a>. It is typical that one of her final projects involved three weeks spent visiting small villages in Gujerat, western India, documenting young girls embroidering their own dowries.</p> <p>As well as their homage to Balthus, Franck and Cartier-Bresson undertook a joint project in the Soviet Union. Franck also created a small book of portraits of her husband. Among the most memorable of this similarly shy and elusive character is that taken from behind, showing the back of his head. His reflection in the square mirror before him is repeated in the self-portrait he is sketching: <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=SearchResult&amp;ALID=2S5RYDYZZTTS\" title=\"Martine Franck's photo of Henri Cartier-Bresson\">a reflection on a reflection</a>. Franck never used him as mentor or protector but warmly concluded: \"Henri was both critical and inspirational as well as warmly supportive of me as a photographer.\" They had a daughter, Melanie, another reason for Franck to operate close to home when possible.</p> <p>Franck's brother, the photographic curator and collector Eric Franck, affirms: \"Henri was always very generous in encouraging her work, something she respected greatly.\" Franck's sister-in-law, Louise Baring, adds: \"What was so extraordinary about Martine was that with subtlety and grace she could both be a great photographer herself and at the same time honour her husband's tradition.\"</p> <p>She worked hard to launch the <a href=\"http://www.henricartierbresson.org/index_en.htm\" title=\"Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson\">Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson</a> in 2002; Henri died two years later.

  "<p>Violence by Jewish settlers has been cited for the first time in a US state department list of \"terrorist incidents\", as Israeli political leaders condemned a string of recent attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank and Jerusalem.</p> <p>The inclusion of assaults on Palestinian targets in the annual report on terrorism reflects growing concern in Israel and internationally that violence by a minority of Jewish extremists could trigger a new cycle of conflict and further damage the prospects of a peace agreement between the two sides.</p> <p>\"Attacks by extremist Israeli settlers against Palestinian residents, property and places of worship in the West Bank continued,\" said the <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2011/\" title=\"\">Country Reports on Terrorism 2011</a>. It referred to \"price tag\" operations, meaning violence committed by radical settlers against Palestinians in retribution for actions by the Israeli government or army deemed to be \"anti-settler\".</p> <p>US and European officials have become more vocal in criticising settler violence amid fears that the actions of a minority of Jewish extremists could provoke a militant response from Palestinians. According to the UN, violent attacks by settlers on Palestinians and their property, mosques and farmland has increased by almost 150% since 2009.</p> <p>On Friday, the US state department condemned \"in the strongest possible terms\" the firebombing of a Palestinian taxi near Bethlehem, in which six people \u2013 including four-year-old twins \u2013 were injured. It urged expeditious action by Israel to bring the perpetrators to justice and for \"all parties to avoid any actions that could lead to an escalation of violence\".</p> <p>The attack was widely blamed on settlers, with military sources suggesting \"Israeli civilians were responsible\". A second firebomb was found near the scene. No arrests had been made by Sunday afternoon.</p> <p>Israeli politicians were also swift in their condemnation. The prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, said it was a \"very serious incident\", and on Sunday, Moshe Ya'alon, minister for strategic affairs, described it as \"a terrorist attack\".</p> <p>He linked the firebombing to a separate incident in Jerusalem at the weekend, in which a Palestinian youth was severely beaten by dozens of Jewish teenagers, who witnesses said were searching for Arabs to attack.</p> <p>\"The hate crimes committed over the weekend against Arabs in Judea and Samaria [the biblical terms for the West Bank] and Jerusalem are intolerable, outrageous and must be firmly dealt with,\" Ya'alon said. \"These are terrorist attacks. They run contrary to Jewish morality and values, and constitute first and foremost an educational and moral failure.\"</p> <p>Jamal Julani, 17, from East Jerusalem, was admitted to hospital in a critical condition and placed on a respirator in the intensive care unit. A 19-year-old Jewish man was arrested, and further arrests were expected. A police spokesman described the incident as a brawl, and said it had no connection to settlers.</p> <p>The Country Reports on Terrorism cited several incidents of settler violence during 2011, including attacks on Israeli military personnel and a base. Over the year 10 mosques in the West Bank and one in an Israeli-Arab town were attacked, it said.</p> <p>Human rights groups which monitor settler violence say it routinely includes assaults against individuals and groups of Palestinians, harassment, uprooting trees, burning fields, attacks on livestock and damage to cars and houses. It usually peaks during the autumn olive harvesting season.</p> <p>According to the UN office for humanitarian affairs, the number of <a href=\"http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_settler_violence_FactSheet_October_2011_english.pdf\" title=\"\">settler attacks causing casualties or damage to Palestinian property has increased by 144% between 2009 and 2011</a>(pdf). Three Palestinians were killed and 183 injured by settlers last year; about 10,000 trees were damaged or destroyed; and more than 90% of complaints filed with Israeli police were closed without charges being brought.</p> <p>\"One of the key factors in the growth of settler violence is the lack of effective law enforcement,\" said Sarit Michaeli of human rights group B'Tselem. \"The Israelis have been calling settler violence 'terrorism' for a while now, but that in itself is not a guarantee that they will fulfil their obligations to protect Palestinians.\"</p> <p>According to B'Tselem, Israeli security forces often fail to intervene to stop settler violence when alerted to it or already present at the scene. In May, a video posted by B'Tselem on Youtube showed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/21/israeli-settler-fires-gun-stone-thrower\" title=\"\">settlers shooting at a group of Palestinian protesters while soldiers and police officers stood by</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137825/daniel-byman-and-natan-sachs/the-rise-of-settler-terrorism\" title=\"\">A recent article published by Foreign Affairs</a> last week, The Rise of Settler Terrorism, attributed the increase in attacks to \"the growth of a small but significant fringe of young extremists, known as the 'hilltop youth', who show little, if any, deference to the Israeli government or even to the settler leadership \u2026 These settlers \u2013 likely no more than a couple of thousand, a small but dangerous minority within the broader community \u2013 are the ones leading the 'price tag' attacks against Palestinian civilians and Israeli soldiers.\"</p> <p>The US state department report also said that in 2011: \"Israel faced terrorist threats from Hamas, the Popular Resistance Committees, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, particularly from Gaza but also from the West Bank, and from Hezbollah in Lebanon.\"</p> <p>Among the terrorist incidents it listed for 2011 were the murder of five members of the Fogel family at their home in a West Bank settlement, the death of a British national and the injury of 50 other people in a bomb explosion at Jerusalem's central bus station, and the killing of a resident of the Israeli city of Ashkelon by a rocket fired from Gaza.</p>",
  "<p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/francois-hollande\" title=\"\">Fran\u00e7ois Hollande</a> hits the 100-day mark, what is the verdict on the man at the top of French politics? In terms of style, his trademarks emerged quickly enough. Hollande has renewed the Gaullist interpretation of the presidency: in accordance with the letter of the constitution, he sees his role as an above-the-party arbiter who lets the prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, govern. Unlike Nicolas Sarkozy, Hollande neither polarises public opinion, nor does he arouse strong feelings. He is generally described as \"decent\" and \"modest\"; adjectives that were never associated with Sarkozy.</p> <p>Three months on, however, the novelty of this change is beginning to wear off. Over the course of the last week, commentators in the media have called on Hollande to start being more specific about his policies and priorities. Some journalists have even begun to mock his quiet tone: the expression <em>pr\u00e9sidence p\u00e9p\u00e8re </em>(\"cushy presidency\") has been used in several broadsheets.</p> <p>So where is France really headed? In line with Hollande's Agenda for Change, released on 4 April, the new Socialist majority in parliament passed a rash of bills before the recess on 2 August. Most were intended to generate an extra \u20ac7.2bn to meet the 2012 deficit targets. The highest-profile reversal of previous government policy was the decision to resume taxing overtime pay and putting an end to state subsidies to fund that exemption. \"Work more to earn more\" was the flagship measure of Sarkozy's 2007 campaign. It aimed to boost the economy by deregulating the labour market. In fact, this reform did nothing to stimulate employee income but cost the state more than \u20ac25bn in tax relief.</p> <p>Another law reinstated salary-based charges that employers pay \u2013 the previous government had shifted those costs to the general public in the form of a tax increase. The infamous Tepa law, passed in August 2007 \u2013 which lowered taxes on assets of wealthier people \u2013 was also revised. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cahuzac, the Socialist minister for the budget, declared that this \"exceptional contribution is a big effort being demanded of those who can afford to make it\". It sounded like a uneasy plea to the rich, rather than a confident decision. This half-hearted approach augurs badly for the intentions of the government when it comes to addressing the widening gap between the rich and the rest of the population.</p> <p>Furthermore, a 75% tax rate on those earning more than \u20ac1m, and a new 45% rate on those earning over \u20ac150,000 has been delayed until the autumn. At the same time, the minimum wage was increased by a token 2%. This felt like a slap in the face for the trade unions and low-income voters.</p> <p>But what about the much-heralded \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/tobin-tax\" title=\"\">Tobin tax</a>\", introduced on 1 August? It's worth clarifying that this is a tax on only 0.2% of the value of financial transactions. Another tax aimed at high-frequency trading was also implemented. The so-called frequency tax is 0.01% on the amount of stock orders modified or cancelled that exceeds 80% of all orders transmitted in a month. In short, it's more of a \"non-transaction\" tax.</p> <p>These \"achievements\" promised to shed a new light on Hollande's much trumpeted intentions of \"further regulating the markets\". The government has used taxation to dissuade bankers from deliberately placing false orders in an attempt to manipulate the market. Take note: Hollande did not try to ban certain practices or introduce new rules. He is simply trying to benefit modestly from the system as it stands.</p> <p>In the runup to the election, Hollande had promised to renegotiate the EU fiscal compact. This endeavour was supported by a large majority of voters. On 29 June, after one of those dramatically choreographed EU summits, a glowing Hollande appeared before cameras and declared: \"Europe has changed in the right direction.\"</p> <p>Yet the French president spectacularly failed to keep his word. Angela Merkel's and Sarkozy's treaty has prevailed unchanged. Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the Left Front presidential candidate, denounced it as a \"knockabout farce\". All Hollande could claim was a derisory \"growth pact\" worth 1% of the EU's GDP (\u20ac130bn). More embarrassing was the revelation that the growth package entailed deploying up to \u20ac55bn in unspent EU structural funds.</p> <p>The Socialist president has not opposed the EU-inspired austerity programmes that are strangling the economies of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Worse, he has implicitly endorsed them by sending an unprecedented, thinly veiled warning to Greek voters days before the dramatic rerun of the general elections. He hinted that if Greeks insisted on casting their votes in favour of Syriza, a leftwing \"anti-austerity\" coalition, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/greek-election-blog-2012/2012/jun/14/greece-bailout-hollande-ultimatum-eurozone\" title=\"\">it could cost them Greece's participation in the eurozone</a>.</p> <p>On 9 August, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Council_of_France\" title=\"\">France's constitutional council</a> ruled that the adoption of the EU fiscal compact did not require a change to the constitution. This would have necessitated the support of three-fifths of MPs; an unachievable majority. Instead, the treaty will enter into force if the government passes an \"organic law\" by a simple majority. Hollande said there would be no referendum on the new treaty \u2013 he is afraid of losing it.</p> <p>This denial of democracy has infuriated the left. Many argue that the pact allows Brussels to dictate national policy by allowing it to impose sanctions on countries that fail to respect a structural deficit ceiling of 0.5% of GDP. The diktat will restrict all governments' room for manoeuvre in the foreseeable future. What is more, it dramatically undermines parliament's powers to pass laws as it sees fit for the country. When the French return from their summer holidays, they can only hope for further spending cuts (\u20ac33bn in 2012-14) and tax rises to meet Hollande's 3% deficit targets by the end of 2013.</p> <p>Hollande has chosen to stay the course of the punitive austerity policies that are ruining European countries. Mr Normal has quietly taken to the neoliberal sea \u2013 and he makes no waves.</p>",

It is make or break time for Somalia, long seen as the world's most failed state.</p> <p>At present, Mogadishu is dystopia. Countless buildings lie pulverised as if by an angry giant, evocative of the ruins of Europe at the end of the second world war. A lone staircase floats where a building used to be; a formerly grand hotel is now a skeleton stripped bare; a cathedral stands with no roof and broken masonry in the nave; a series of beachside bars and restaurants resemble ancient ruins. Few walls are free of bulletholes or cracked and crumbling plaster. Roads are rutted and potholed, quickly flooding with rainwater, and stinking rubbish goes uncollected. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jun/18/somali-mogadishu-vulnerable-progress\" title=\"\">Displaced people squat in domed tents amid the rubble</a>.Guns are everywhere.</p> <p>It is into this apocalyptic vision that the artists project. At a garage-cum-studio last week, their giant works were leaning against the walls. One diptych showed rodents with moneybags queuing up at \"the office of who you know\", then the happier scene of people with qualifications lining up at \"the office of what do you know\". A triptych portays a fallen young Somali rising from the ground and finally standing tall with the national flag.</p> <p>In the middle of the night, these works will be silently moved to prime locations in the city to make a public plea for justice, security and a national vision. The veteran artists are resurrecting a culture that was devastated 21 years ago when Somalia's government collapsed and warlords filled the vacuum.</p> <p>Ibrahim, 62, relaxing on a car seat on the floor (the car is long gone), learned to paint under an Italian mentor and was the official presidential portraitist. \"You had to try as much as possible to make him look more handsome and elegant,\" he recalled. \"You could not show his age.\"</p> <p>Hundreds of the portraits, and much of his other work, were lost in the chaos. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/31/shabaab-somalia-islamic-militia-refugees?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">Then came al-Shabaab</a>, bringing a semblance of order and youth appeal (it runs <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HSMPress\" title=\"\">a Twitter account</a>) but also a Taliban-like ban on TV, music, bras and depictions of humans and animals. These artists continued to draw in secret behind closed doors, however, and when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/07/somali-troops-mogadishu-rebels-out\" title=\"\">al-Shabaab was pushed out of Mogadishu by US-backed African Union forces</a> last year, the artists could return to the open. \"It was freedom for artists,\" Ibrahim said. \"We decided to work again.\"</p> <p>The old friends had been apart for years and were initially frightened of meeting again. They were helped by a parcel containing brushes, paints and other essential materials sent by a British benefactor. \"We were like children on Christmas day,\" said Adan Farah Affey, 50.</p> <p>The collective is now mentoring and teaching young people in a scheme run by Somalia's <a href=\"http://www.crdsomalia.org\" title=\"\">Centre for Research and Dialogue</a>. Affey hopes to develop Somalia's first ever art academy. Yet he used to be afraid of young people.</p> <p>\"Al-Shabaab used youth for recruitment,\" he added. \"A young guy can come and assassinate you. But I believe this project will stop them joining al-Shabaab because artists need to concentrate. It teaches them a way of life. If you are an artist, you need to be gentle and wise. You cannot kill yourself.\"</p> <p>Among the students is Suleyman Mohamed Yusuf, 20, who previously spent two years in a militia, collecting money at checkpoints and witnessing the killings of car passengers including children. \"At the checkpoint people were afraid of me,\" he recalled. \"You have a gun and you have the power. At that time I behaved as if I was the most powerful man in the city \u2013 I could capture the city.</p> <p>\"But I don't miss it because it was the wrong way because either you kill or be killed. Neither has any benefit for you. I've seen many troubles and I do not want to see them again.\"</p> <p>Describing the artists, Yusuf added: \"These are the only guys I admire. I've never seen people like this.\"</p> <p>The Centre, a thinktank working for reconciliation, is headed by Jabril Ibrahim Abdulle, 42, who lost his entire family in the civil war. It is running other youth projects including a My Mogadishu photography group \u2013 \"instead of shooting an AK47, they shoot a camera\" \u2013 a system for awarding grants and even a Somali Idols talent contest.</p> <p>Jabril Abdulle argues that young people, who make up the majority of the population, will decide Somalia's fate. \"The new constitution doesn't mention youth. There's no one consulting them. That's why al-Shabaab happened: they even took the name 'youth' [shabaab]. They did what the government is supposed to do in terms of reaching young people. They recruited people from the diaspora via Facebook to come and blow themselves up. It was a silent killer and no one was paying attention.\"</p> <p>Jabril Abdulle reckons there have been \"four or five\" assassination attempts against him. He was at the national theatre <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/04/somalia-theatre-suicide-bombing-shabaab\" title=\"\">when a suicide bomber struck earlier this year</a>; giving up his seat to elders, until he was at the end of the row, saved his life. He speaks to the Guardian a day after the director of the international airport was gunned down on his way to breakfast.</p> <p>Yet the defeat of al-Shabaab in Mogadishu, and the peace \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/02/somali-comic-marshale-death-threat\" title=\"\">a relative term</a> \u2013 that has followed, offer a sliver of hope.

The city hums with crammed minibus taxis, land cruisers with darkened windows and saloon cars that have seen better days \u2013 a bustle unthinkable amid the bullets and mortars just a year ago.</p> <p>\"For the first time in Somalia, something is happening,\" Jabril Abdulle said. \"People are saying we shall not rely on the government; what you see in Mogadishu is nothing to do with the government. People are saying enough is enough. About 150 buildings here are being renovated. Al-Shabaab will be defeated by the will and aspirations of the Somali people. They are really ready to move on.\"</p> <p>He estimates that 4,000-5,000 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19254249\" title=\"\">members of the Somalia diaspora</a> have been coming and going in the past three months, some bringing their children for the first time. But scarred by false dawns of the past, Jabril Abdulle warned: \"Something good is happening and I am scared. I don't want to lose it. We are on the edge. I can't say we're at a tipping point; we're at a pre-tipping point.\"</p> <p>The biggest hope, but also the biggest risk, comes on Monday when the weak transitional federal government is replaced by a president, prime minister, speaker and MPs elected by clan elders (Somalia is far from ready for a truly democratic election). The UN has already warned that the process is steeped in corruption; a parliamentary seat can reportedly be bought for $50,000 (\u00a331,832). Jabril Abdulle is wary of the fallout.</p> <p>\"You will have a lot of bad losers,\" he warned. \"They might not walk away. They might say, 'If I lose, everyone has to lose.' Somalia does not have a democratic tradition. There is a window of opportunity to engage the youth, but the possibility of returning to war is there. The value of an AK47 hasn't really gone down.\"</p> <p>The result could be a melee of warlords competing for power redolent of Afghanistan. Already, some say, there is an increase of checkpoints in Mogadishu in the absence of African Union forces, who are pursuing the battle with al-Shabaab elsewhere. Two militia groups are said to be competing for the spoils if and when al-Shabaab is driven out of its stronghold, the port city of Kismayu. Some analysts believe the writing is on the wall.</p> <p>One said: \"My feeling about the transition is that it's quite a lot of hot air and there are really significant challenges in the next six months. Poor Ugandans in the African Union forces are getting killed to create space for something but nobody's sure what it is.</p> <p>\"There's a danger it's going to give power to the people who were in control before 2006 and made Somalia a really shitty place. The rhetoric is that something new and beautiful is being built, but I'm not sure I believe it.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ray Whitney, who has died aged 81, was a member of the generation of Conservative politicians who chose to make the House of Commons a career because of a profound personal conviction about the need for change in British politics in the last quarter of the 20th century. Coming from a working-class background, he was a natural supporter of Margaret Thatcher, but he differed from many of her other enthusiastic parliamentary acolytes by exhibiting a free-thinking, independent-minded approach that inevitably inhibited his short-lived ministerial career.</p> <p>His arrival at Westminster, as the victor of the Wycombe byelection in 1978 (caused by the death of his predecessor, Sir John Hall) on an increased majority, was a signal of the swing to the Conservatives which would sweep Thatcher into office the following year. He was seen as a hardline Tory rightwinger with strong views on such predictable subjects as the Soviet Union and the trade unions, but he was also true to the views he had reached during his earlier careers in the army and the Foreign Office. He was an enthusiastic European throughout his time in parliament, bemoaning the lack of coherence displayed by both the Thatcher and Major governments on this increasingly controversial issue.</p> <p>Having been head of chancery at the British embassy in Argentina from 1969 to 1972, he also struck a highly individual line within the Conservative party over Britain's decision to send a taskforce to recapture the Falkland Islands, in 1982, expressing considerable doubt about the move in the Commons' emergency debate and angering the Tory right by urging negotiations for a diplomatic solution. \"I have always been passionately committed to finding a longterm stable solution for the Falkland Islanders and for Anglo-Argentine relations,\" he said. However, although the episode changed his standing in the party, Thatcher rated his honesty and reliability, and after her triumph in the 1983 post-Falklands war election she appointed him as the junior minister at the FCO with responsibility for relations with Buenos Aires.</p> <p>He had taken the first step on the ladder of promotion when Nigel Lawson and Peter Rees chose him as their joint parliamentary private secretary at the Treasury in 1979. It was not a position that was conducive to Whitney, who was 47 when he entered the Commons, was of a similar age to his two bosses and disliked the constraints of being unable to speak his mind in the chamber. He had resigned as a diplomat in order to pursue his political beliefs and now found that the compensations of being an unpaid political bag-carrier were slight. He only lasted a few months in the post, but found far greater satisfaction as vice-chairman of the party's employment committee and chairman of its foreign affairs committee until he joined the government in 1983.</p> <p>Whitney was a much-liked man at Westminster. He had a practised diplomatic charm, but it was genuine and he was always courteous even with those whose politics were anathema to him. He was energetic, enthusiastic and fizzing with ideas for new ways of doing things, and on a number of issues was ahead of his time. He promoted an early attempt to make union strike ballots compulsory and an unsuccessful bill to reform Sunday trading. He started an organisation to encourage arms control, chaired the Mountbatten Community Trust, became chairman of the Positive European Group and was licensed as a lay minister in the Church of England.</p> <p>He spoke French, Spanish and Mandarin fluently and enjoyed interpreting when required at international parliamentary functions. After a year at the FCO, he was moved sideways to the Department of Health and remained an enthusiastic campaigner for NHS reform for the remainder of his career. He was a minister only until 1986, when he was sacked \u2013 mainly because he appeared dispensable \u2013 but he nevertheless remained loyal to Thatcher. In 1988 he wrote a book promoting a radical introduction of a voucher system for healthcare. He was knighted in 1997.</p> <p>Whitney was the son of George, a shoe-factory worker in Northampton, and his wife, Ethel. He went to Wellingborough school, Northamptonshire, and Sandhurst and was commissioned into the Northamptonshire Regiment in 1951. He served in Italy, Korea, Hong Kong and Germany and was seconded to the Australian army from 1960 until 1963, when he resigned to become a diplomat the following year. He took a degree at London University's School of Asian and Oriental Studies and was first secretary in Peking from 1966 for two years.</p> <p>In 1967 he was involved in three attacks by Red Guards on British diplomats, during the last of which the British embassy was blockaded and then attacked, ransacked and set on fire. During the blockade, Whitney and the other embassy staff played water polo and watched Ealing comedies \u2013 having first burned all the important paperwork. He then helped the staff escape, using his military expertise, and they found refuge in the Albanian embassy. The Chinese refused to allow Whitney an exit visa for a year. His other posts included deputy high commissioner in Bangladesh and heading the FCO's counter-propaganda department.</p> <p>In 1956 he married Sheila Prince, with whom he had two sons, Simon and Mark. They all survive him.</p> <p>\u2022 Raymond William Whitney, politician, born 28 November 1930; died 15 August 2012</p>",
  "<p>The growing row over biofuels is ready to flare up again with German researchers claiming to have found evidence that European-produced biodiesel does not meet the sustainability targets claimed by Brussels.</p> <p>Two experts at Friedrich Schiller University in Jena say eight out of their 10 tests on locally produced rapeseed biodiesel failed to show the 35% greenhouse gas savings promised. In most cases it was under 30%. The use of biofuels would be further undermined when the EU emissions target increases, as planned, to 50% in five years' time.</p> <p>Gernot Pehnelt and Christoph Vietze also claim their work has been undermined by a lack of co-operation from the European Union which they believe is on the defensive over championing local energy crops.</p> <p>\"Our results indicate that the 'sustainability' of rapeseed biodiesel in the interpretation of the [EU's] renewable energy directive is at best questionable and in most scenarios simply unjustifiable,\" said Pehnelt. \"What we need is transparency. The European commission hesitates to publish all the background data and promises to come up with new calculations for individual biofuels but they have not come up with any values yet.\"</p> <p>Biofuels are accused by the UN and others of pushing up world food prices, and exacerbating the effect of the most severe drought in the US in half a century. US legislators called on the environmental protection agency this month to waive its ethanol mandate that stipulates 40% of the American corn crop is turned into biodiesel. The US department of agriculture said the corn yield would be the lowest for 17 years, raising grain prices as it means there will be more demand for wheat to be used as animal feed.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Graziano da Silva, director general of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) at the United Nations, said he wanted to see a halt in US government-backed production of corn-based ethanol, which is mixed with petrol to make \"greener\" fuel, amid fears the world is heading for another food crisis like the one in 2008 that triggered riots.</p> <p>The EU's lack of transparency on biofuels has already been challenged by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) such as Client Earth, and the German academics say their problems play into the hands of those who believe that Brussels is deliberately overstating the benefits of local rapeseed for political reasons.</p> <p>Germany, France and Italy are the EU's biggest producers of rapeseed oil, and are also home to a car manufacturing industry that actively supports the use of biodiesel for reducing carbon emissions.</p> <p>Europe's renewable energy directive, introduced three years ago, demands that greenhouse gas emissions from production and use of biofuels for transport must be at least 35% lower than those from fossil fuels. In 2017 that marker is meant to rise to 50%.</p> <p>Plans drawn up by EU member states predict that bio-energy, including biomass for power generation and biofuel for transport, will provide more than 50% of the EU share of renewable energy as part of 2020 climate goals.</p> <p>Use of biodiesel is expected to double by 2020 to 19.95m tonnes of oil equivalent from around 10m tonnes in 2010.</p> <p>Brussels faces a big challenge coming up with the investment and technology needed to move to a new feedstock for biodiesel, such as weeds and waste stems that would take the pressure off grain supplies for food.</p> <p>The EU also needs to find inputs that would no longer result in the clearing of environmentally sensitive forests and wetlands to plant fuel crops, an issue known as indirect land use change.</p> <p>The finds of the two German academics have received the support of Fausto Freire, who conducts research on biofuels at the University of Coimbra in Portugal. He told Nature magazine that there are \"huge uncertainties\" associated with the greenhouse-gas emissions of biodiesel but another academic, Gerhard Brankatschk at Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, believed the east German study had \"severe shortcomings\".</p> <h2>Nestl\u00e9: End biofuels now\"<br></h2> <p>The chairman of the world's biggest food group Nestl\u00e9, Peter Brabeck, has called on politicians to lobby to end the use of food in the production of biofuels.</p> <p>\"This does not mean that biofuel should be scrapped entirely but that producers should use other organic materials,\" Brabeck told the Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung.</p> <p>He joins a growing chorus of politicians and scientists calling for a rethink in biofuel production.</p> <p>\"Our problem is that almost half of US corn production and 60% of European rape is being used for fuel production,\" he said.</p> <p>Biofuel production is adding pressure on food prices which are already being boosted by climate change.</p> <p>\"[Food] prices are increasingly prone to swings and correlate more and more with oil prices,\" he said.</p> <p>He also called for more transparency in international commodities markets.</p>",
  "<p>We are writing to express our shock and dismay at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/9?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">the addition to the Guardian's US commentary team</a> of a man who has openly called for the killing of people on humanitarian missions to Palestine, people who have included the Pulitzer-prize-winning author Alice Walker.</p> <p>The extreme views of your new freelance contributor Joshua Trevi\u00f1o, whose columns will appear on your Guardian US website from tomorrow, are no secret. In 2011, he used Twitter to urge the Israeli army to murder unarmed US citizens who were preparing to sail from Greece on a flotilla to Gaza. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-news-blog/2012/aug/16/2011-gaza-flotilla-tweet-clarification\" title=\"\">Trevi\u00f1o tweeted</a>: \"Dear IDF: If you end up shooting any Americans on the new Gaza flotilla \u2013 well, most Americans are cool with that. Including me.\" He also backed a tweet which called for the sinking of the flotilla, which would have endangered the lives of all on board, and likened this peaceful mission to a \"Nazi convoy\".</p> <p>In what way does publishing a man who clearly has no regard for the rule of law, and who advocates the killing of his fellow citizens by a foreign army, enhance the Guardian's reputation as a serious newspaper? The extremist views of people like Trevi\u00f1o, who have no hesitation in wishing death upon those who disagree with them, can be found on countless sensationalist, racist and hate-speech websites. They have no place in a reputable publication.</p> <p>Moreover, Trevi\u00f1o is hardly without vested interests. He served on the board of the pro-Israel group Act for Israel, and was listed on its website as being \"a staunch digital advocate of Israel\". This former speechwriter for George W Bush will no doubt be bringing his one-sided political views to the Guardian and using it as a platform for his propaganda.

I'm at a book festival, and all those are in my next novel \u2013 a novel I'm so desperate to get back to that I can barely see straight. </p> <p>Instead, I keep returning to a sort of family tree.</p> <p>It begins with the American dream, a promise of moderate prosperity: a detached house in the suburbs with a white picket fence, a stately family car in the drive. It's the promise at the root not only of the US self-perception, but of every modern capitalist democracy \u2013 not a job for life, but a life made good by a job. But it has been suspect for much of the last hundred years \u2013 Steinbeck's Of Mice And Men is about the hollowness of the hope in the time of the Great Depression. The second world war didn't help. Then the space race of the 60s and 70s revived the premise; Nasa commissioned a series of artists' impressions, essentially <a href=\"http://images.businessweek.com/ss/10/03/0302_affordable_suburbs/4.htm\">Cave Creek, Arizona</a>, but in orbit \u2013 replacing the westward expansion of the early US with an outward one into the wider solar system. The idea of space colonisation coincides, also, with the arrival of environmentalism in the form of the Gaia hypothesis, and boundaries to capitalism in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth\">The Limits to Growth</a>. It's a way of avoiding the acknowledgement of a world of finite resources and the corollary that wealth is a zero sum game: if you own X, that means I don't.</p> <p>The original dream was replaced, ultimately, by the lottery win: the perfect story of being discovered, of a natural talent shining through a TV screen or down from a stage, inspiring worship and wealth. But the truth of the lottery win is hard, even as the fantasy is outrageous: it probably won't happen to you. It relies not entirely on talent, nor on hard work. It happens when your ship comes in. And again, the lottery win denies the solid, simple, common-sense wisdom on which I was raised, but which now seems almost Dickensian: the acknowledgement that there's no such thing as a free lunch. Everything is paid for in the end.</p> <p>That truth is the inconvenient one, both to politicians who must pledge obvious impossibilities in the popularity contest of election, and corporations, who have learned that the simplest way to sell something is to claim that it costs nothing. Throughout the 90s and early 2000s, our financial industry and governments leaned on a snake oil mirage of wealth creation, a bubble predicated on the obvious falsehood that things could only get better. The digital rhetoric of a nascent internet played its part, too: a consequence-free environment where creative works could be endlessly duplicated, identity was malleable, and discussion was unregulatable. The digital cost is still being counted, though I suspect it will ultimately be lower than the gain. The larger mirage was revealed for what it was in the collapse of its most extreme example: the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/subprimecrisis\">sub-prime mortgages which were never intended to be repaid</a>, were in fact to all intents and purposes unrepayable, but which were created to be sold on, a toxic future which inevitably poisoned the financial waters when the bill came due.</p> <p>The law of conservation of energy applies. Nothing is without consequence. In abandoning the understanding that things \u2013 services, goods, wars and houses \u2013 have costs, we risk becoming infantilised, incapable of making decisions about government or finance, and perhaps above all about the environment, the wellbeing of the planet upon which we depend and which our children will inherit from us. It's convenient to those above us, and messily injurious to us and our future. The free lunch is a bad idea, and we need to rid ourselves of it, to take back our understanding of consequence and worth, and demand to see the numbers so we know what we're getting into.</p> <p>And having said that aloud, perhaps I can go back to my book.</p> <p><strong>Nick Harkaway is discussing The Blind Giant and his latest novel, Angelmaker at the Edinburgh International Book Festival<br></strong></p>",
  "<p>The need to raise awareness about endangered species has never been more pressing.
