  "<p>For 90 minutes on Sunday life in S\u00e9dhiou, southern Senegal will be placed on pause. Papiss Ciss\u00e9, the town's most famous son, is expected to lead Newcastle United's attack at home to Manchester United and his every touch will be cheered.</p> <p>People in S\u00e9dhiou remember Ciss\u00e9 as a 15-year-old, whose first job was driving an ambulance. It explains why the striker sends a significant percentage of his wages back home. Ciss\u00e9 has already bought the local hospital a new ambulance and x-ray machines and is funding the purchase of further medical equipment as well as the building of an education centre and a mosque.</p> <p>The 27-year-old is motivated by the memories of S\u00e9dhiou's hospital being so primitive that he regularly had to drive patients 188 miles to Dakar, Senegal's capital, only for several to die en route.</p> <p>Newcastle is a different world but both the city and S\u00e9dhiou will be in party mode should Alan Pardew's side reprise the 3-0 win they enjoyed against Manchester United last January. At the time Ciss\u00e9 was still to complete his \u00a39m move from Freiburg and it was left to Demba Ba and Shola Ameobi to deconstruct Sir Alex Ferguson's defence.</p> <p>Now though Ameobi is pushing Ciss\u00e9 hard for a starting place, while Hatem Ben Arfa has excelled on the right of the front three. Pardew trusts this attacking armoury will not only compensate for a raft of defensive injuries but eclipse Wayne Rooney and Robin Van Persie.</p> <p>\"Audacity\" is fast becoming one of the Newcastle manager's favourites words and he hopes Ciss\u00e9 and company will be full of it against United. \"We have to have the audacity to take the game to Manchester United,\" Pardew said. \"If you sit back they'll beat you. That's what they've been doing for 20 years, finding ways through defences. We have to get enough control of the game to create chances for our goal-scoring assets.\"</p> <p>Newcastle's early season struggles to recapture last season's \"rhythmic football\" \u2013 another of Pardew's favourite terms \u2013 saw their manager \"read the riot act\" in the dressing room earlier this week.</p> <p>Happily for Pardew, Thursday night's 3-0 Europa League win against Bordeaux suggested that his players had taken heed, but if United are to be overcome, Newcastle will require Yohan Cabaye and Cheick Tiot\u00e9 \u2013 Ciss\u00e9's best friend \u2013 to excel in central midfield.</p> <p>Like Tiot\u00e9, Cabaye and Ba, Ciss\u00e9, so prolific last season, began the new campaign slugglishly, but a fine goal against Bordeaux suggested he is now back on form. \"I have some surprises for defenders,\" he said. \"It's a secret, something I've been working on with the coach.\"</p> <p>It could be a long afternoon for Rio Ferdinand.</p>",
  "<p>I was but 15 years old when I discovered that golf was a wonderful sport run by the sort of people you would only want to introduce to the family Rottweiler. This was when I encountered <a href=\"http://www.clobergolfclub.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Clober golf club</a> in Milngavie, near Glasgow. Its claim to fame, apparently, is that Sandy Lyle's father-in-law was one of the blazerati there. I couldn't tell you much about it except to report that, from my perspective, it seemed to be covered entirely in long grass with little pockets of sand here and there. So perhaps you might imagine my excitement when I approached the 17th green and found that the only ball occupying its glossy surface was my unkempt Dunlop 65 and that it had reached this sanctuary in fewer than 10&#xa0;blows.</p> <p>Elated by these first signs of prowess at the game, I ran towards the ball to check that it was, indeed, mine and not the ubiquitous Penfold Commando of Derek Moss, the only boy from within our group who could swing a club without making it look like a mechanical digger. Regrettably, in my excitement, I had neglected to let go of my golf trolley as I executed my Seve victory jig. This vehicle, being of vintage character and my uncle's cast-off, possessed thin wheels and thus it scarred the previously coiffeured putting surface with two appalling parallel lines.</p> <p>By the time I had reached the 18th green, word had obviously reached the clubhouse of my misdemeanour, for there was a reception committee lying in wait, comprising Les Dawson, Oliver Hardy and Mr Barraclough from <em>Porridge</em>, united in their beer-stained, masonic-ringed fury. They are the same three sclerotic and puce-featured oafs that can be encountered in every golf club committee in Scotland. The club captain's house overlooked the 17th green, I was informed, and he had witnessed this breach of the club's rules. Didn't the club captain have any work to go to, I wondered and, refusing to apologise, I was escorted from the premises as fast as the feet of Les Dawson, his head bobbing alongside my golf trolley, could carry him.</p> <p>It was the last time I ever went near a golf course until, unaccountably, my sons began to play. Even then I only watched from a safe distance and observed that the game in Scotland still attracts a municipal gendarmerie, which likes to convey a laughable sense of elitism and exclusivity.</p> <p>I suppose they don't do much harm if they remain within the confines of their little clubs and converted fields. Unfortunately, and to the perpetual embarrassment of Scotland, they also run the R&amp;A, the organisation which administers the game here. In the last few months assorted R&amp;A panjandrums have sought to defend the existence of male-only golf clubs. We are very nice to lady visitors at these clubs, so how can we be accused of sexism, was what they were, in effect, saying. Just a few weeks earlier, America's Augusta National club, home of the Masters, announced that it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/20/augusta-national-women-members-golf\" title=\"\">admitting women members</a> for the first time. Augusta is the sort of establishment that, if it governed America, we would all now be living in a post-nuclear apocalypse \u2026 and they would still want to bomb Russia.</p> <p>Many members of the government play golf and are members of clubs where women cannot be members. The Open golf championship, when it visits Scotland, is hosted by three of these clubs. If it was known that they didn't allow Catholics, Jews, blacks, Muslims or gays to be members, they would be shut down tomorrow. The Scottish government should withdraw any funding it gives the R&amp;A for its youth development work. How any organisation that supports men-only golf clubs can be allowed to work with children on government-supported courses is a mystery to me. Public sector workers who join such clubs should be subject to disciplinary action as such membership would be a clear breach of local authority anti-discrimination regulations.</p> <p>It's only when I watch the Ryder Cup that I realise how wonderful golf can be. Last weekend's events at the Medinah Club in Chicago, when Europe vanquished the Americans, constituted the greatest golfing comeback of all time. At this level golf is the most majestic sport in the world. It is sad, though, that the solitary nature of most tournament golf gives us a procession of sullen and self-obsessed misfits. The players are often worse. What raises the Ryder Cup to a level far above the normal, each-man-for-himself competitions, is the pleasantly raucous behaviour of the crowds.</p> <p>The Americans, especially, get carried away with all the fervour, simply because it is the only opportunity they have to support their nation in a genuinely international team event. Wouldn't it be splendid if all professional golf was conducted in such a manner?</p> <p>I'm sure Sky, backed by a couple of banks, could introduce a national golf league on a franchise basis where the major cities in Europe compete against each other over a day in a mini-Ryder Cup format. Then we could follow our team and indulge in the sort of behaviour that is normally expected from a travelling support. We could sing punchy little verses such as \"Who put the ball in the London cup, Sammy Sammy Torrance,\" to the tune of Yankee Doodle Dandy; or \"We hate Nick Fal-do; he's aloof, he's aloof.\"</p> <p>The golf courses would see shaven-headed, middle-aged men stripped to the waist and bearing the favours of their city. The players would learn to adapt to the robust atmosphere and would start questioning the match referees' decisions about free drops and hazards. In no time they'd be swearing and verbally abusing their opponents joyously as they sought to gain an advantage for their own side. As their newly discovered team ethic kicked in they would indulge in \"simulation\" and \"gamesmanship\" by kicking their balls into a better lie in the rough.</p> <p>Before long, the bePringled and chinless hordes who currently follow golf would be driven out in this new, egalitarian and diverse spirit. This would be the best outcome of all.</p>",
  "<p>No other city has celebrated its spangly car crashes of bright-burning characters quite like New York. Dorothy Parker, pretending her tears were just gin spilt in the middle of a new joke; Andy Warhol, who wanted to get as far from himself as everyone else wanted to get closer; journalist Pete Hamill and his cohort hard-drinking their way towards death in a celebration of life. And, sitting in front of me, moving within minutes from a bravura \"I really resent sometimes living in this time period; there's no decadence any more\" to a tearful collapse over her tiny chicken salad \u2013 \"I'm always lonely. I've never been in love\" \u2013 is this town's latest burning star.</p> <p>It's not as though no one has ever taken drugs in this city before and written about it. It's not as if no writer has ever flounced out of their job. But it's unprecedented that such a double act should merit not only multiple magazine profiles but a very public letter of resignation to the city, via the <em>New York Post</em>. Cat Marnell is probably right that this isn't a decadent town any more \u2013 not since Rudy Giuliani took office as mayor in 1994. But that's not the only reason Marnell sparks such adoring and condemnatory interest: she is also the first high-profile burn-up of the Twitter years, these years where storming from the office with a warm quart of gin and a zinging aphorism is a quaint archaism of a gesture. Instead self-immolation takes place in electronic nanoseconds, online, where it's magnified by myriad reposts and retweets.</p> <p>And so, last July, Marnell sent an email to the <em>New York Post</em>. Why, she scoffed, spend \"another summer meeting deadlines behind a computer at night when I could be on the rooftop of Le Bain looking for shooting stars and smoking angel dust with my friends\"?</p> <p>The job she was leaving was as beauty editor at women's website xojane, where she had become celebrated for reviews that were as much about her enjoyment of drugs as they were about cosmetics. Finally her drug use had become so heavy that Jane Pratt, the website's founding editor, had to let her friend go. Marnell was hired almost immediately by <em>Vice</em>, the youth culture media conglomerate that delights in controversy. As its self-styled \"pills and narcissism\" correspondent, she began a column called Amphetamine Logic, and her writing became even harder to quit.</p> <p>Marnell recounts parties and drugs and sex in writing that mirrors the experience of being on drugs \u2013 sometimes fizzing (\"You know what speed is like? It shrieks you up through the sky\u2026 explodes over and over again with durrr ideas, fluorescent-rainbow nothings like fireworks that scatter sparks and ash\") and, just as often, cold and blunt and brutal (\"I start scrolling through my phone for someone to fuck. Then I stop caring about that, too, and decide to just go home\").</p> <p>This was how she introduced herself to her <em>Vice</em> audience: \"I'm the one\u2026 dressed like a sort of slutty Commedia dell'Arte Zanni, in white rags, a Dior slap bracelet, a Winston \u2013 I know, inexplicably \u2013 tucked behind my ear, a nameplate necklace that says 'methadone' in cursive (indeed, roll your eyes; please), filthy white Topshop flats, three plastic rosaries in pastel colours that are all chewed up.\"</p> <p>But the reason Marnell resonates, and could do so for years, is that she's more than a poor little rich girl with a hard drug habit; she is clever and, crucially, she refuses to conform to the sanctioned narratives of either desperate victim or contrite, recovering addict.</p> <p>\"The reality is so many people are using drugs,\" she says. \"I know hardly anybody who isn't. But people aren't used to people writing about drugs.\"</p> <p>Sanctimony certainly isn't a charge you can levy at <em>Vice</em>, where her popularity confirms that losing one job due to her addiction has in fact been an excellent career move. It also, however, means that her own disintegration, physical and psychological, has now become her \"brand\". Her job now, as a recent <em>New York Magazine</em> profile put it, is \"to be fucked up\". But is it our job to spectate?</p> <p>As I wait FOR HER in an East Village caf\u00e9 I&#xa0;start to feel foolish for thinking she'll turn up at all. Then there's a ripple and I&#xa0;look the way of the turned heads. They're appraising the small, tanned, very blonde figure who is crossing the road, half-striding, half-hobbling, in ferociously heeled pastel stilettos. Perhaps they're staring because she's hard not to stare at, or perhaps they're staring because Marnell's notoriety has now transcended the comment boards and made her famous in the offline world, too.</p> <p>She's wearing a torn white clingy vest of a dress and clutching a graffitied handbag that looks as though it's been kicked around countless nightclub corners. Breathless non-explanations tumble out \u2013 she ended up \"at some guy's apartment\", there was \"way too much coke\". Making haphazard gestures towards her face, she adds: \"I'm, like, caked in make-up with my false eyelashes falling off.\" She seems to be performing her own chaos. This, it seems, is the character she's made for herself, or maybe one the internet has helped make.</p> <p>Marnell is 30, but her snub-nosed, round-eyed bratty beauty (she is made even more doll-like by those in fact perfectly intact false eyelashes) and her very petite frame (a side effect of amphetamines) make her look a decade younger. She calls herself an adult child. \"It's very Peter Pan. A girl can be a lost boy, too.\" She boasts about her own helplessness. \"I don't know how to do anything. I don't know how to drive; I don't know how to pay taxes; I don't know how to keep a house; I don't own any dishes.\"</p> <p>Marnell is the middle daughter of psychologist parents with whom she has next to no contact. Her older sister is a publicist and she claims not to know what her younger brother does. It was a privileged upbringing: \"I was raised with everything \u2013 this huge house with a guest house and tennis courts and everything, but I was so unhappy.\"</p> <p>She tells of her ultra-Republican father tearing up a Riot Grrrl 'zine she made and forbidding her to use the word \"feminism\" in his house. As for her mother, she was \"like an ice cube: she literally wouldn't talk to us. She was just completely unable to connect with us. I was raised by nannies. I left home at 15 for prep school and never went back.\"</p> <p>This was when her father put her on Ritalin to improve her grades: \"I was top of my class for years because I did everything better than everybody else because I was on so much speed.\" She has been on amphetamines ever since. \"The <em>New York Times</em> is still publishing articles like: 'Oh, college kids are using Adderall' and I'm like: 'Yo \u2013 is this, like, 1997?' What people aren't talking about is how these Ritalin kids are turning into Adderall adults. You think I'm the only one taking Adderall?\"</p> <p>Before xojane, Marnell was a beauty editor at Cond\u00e9 Nast magazine <em>Lucky</em>, where her drug use quickly became a problem. \"I was disgusting. I was 90lb and green and coming in with nosebleeds and hiding in the beauty closet. I was hanging out with some really bad people doing heroin.\"</p> <p>She left <em>Lucky</em> for $1,000- a-day rehab clinic Silver Hill Hospital, a choice governed partly by the fact that her beloved Edie Sedgwick had gone there. She paid for it herself, she says, while her employers put her on disability pay. She loved it there: \"Eating meals at a table with people and being in a house with people was really fun for me. It felt like family.\"</p> <p>But a few months after leaving she fell apart: \"I did the thing when you take all the pills and then you call someone and you're locked in your apartment. I was taken out on a gurney and all of that. But that was, you know, the height of the drama for me. It's not really representative of who I am and the problems I have. My recreational drug use is not a problem. Nobody would be using drugs if there weren't tons of upsides. I love stimulants, I love being wired and I love, as New Yorkers say, just coming out of my face. I <em>love </em>it. I'm definitely not going to die \u2013 I'm very conscientious about what I mix and what I don't.\"</p> <p>That morning she'd tweeted: \"I hate my career I just want a boyfriend\". The sorry statement made sorrier still by all the blithe retweets and \"favourites\" it generated from her thousands of followers.</p> <p>\"I hate men,\" she tells me, then corrects herself. \"It's not that I hate men: I hate myself around men. If I'm rejected, the shame is too much \u2013 it's devastating. A lot of addicts can't handle that. Because we already hate ourselves, to have that validated by some man not wanting you is... too much.\"</p> <p>The thing that seems to be keeping her going is her book, a memoir, although she admits that her agent is \"mad at her\" for still not having written the proposal. The agent is Byrd Leavell, who pioneered the blog- to-book trend with Tucker Max, a frat boy named one of the \"douchebags of the decade\" by Gawker for his chronicling of his own immoderate drinking and sleeping around.</p> <p>When I speak to Leavell I mention the boyfriend tweet and ask whether he worries about exploitation. He doesn't seem to understand my question. Does it bother him, I persist, that she's now effectively dependent on this identity and reality as an addict? And that the internet both exposes and encourages that vulnerability? Isn't this a problem?</p> <p>\"You're right in many ways,\" he says. \"It always strikes me what thick skin you have to have. Because commenters are\u2026 merciless. When you choose to write about yourself online, there's kind of no half-measures. But if she did a whole book as good as her best pieces\u2026 I mean, <em>imagine</em>. Imagine the validation \u2013 and the copies that would sell.\"</p> <p>I think it's naive to hope that he \u2013 and everyone else \u2013 might prioritise the former.</p> <p>\"I'm the first to say my life is glamorous,\" Marnell declares. \"The people I hang out with are fabulous. And that's really what I'm about. Drug addicts \u2013 and drug use \u2013 are boring; it's what lives they're living that creates a story.\"</p> <p>But notes of fabulousness do not, ultimately, make that story any less bleak, or the exploitation \u2013 hers and ours \u2013 any less problematic. I like the story of the nonchalant writer-heroine doing whatever she wants, shamelessly, messily, so much more than the story of the desperately sad addict. Unfortunately, both are true.</p> <p>\"At the core of addiction,\" Marnell continues, \"is a depression that feels unbearable. In July I spent 11 days in my apartment and I did not go outside. It's hard to write this stuff, but it's also boring. Who wants to read about what it's like to be in bed for days?\"</p> <p>But the thing is, lots of people do: the abject dejection of her comedowns, self-loathing and lovelessness are just as compelling as the descriptions of downtown glamour.</p> <p>Her most recent <em>Vice</em> column ran three weeks ago and looked as though it could be one of the last. \"I am better,\" she announced, \"and I will continue to get better, and it doesn't matter to me that you don't want to believe this, or don't understand what it means.\"</p> <p>But she also wrote: \"I'll be 30 years old in four days, and here's the big revelation: it's OK to be a freak show. It makes you special and strange and valuable to the universe.\"</p>",
  "<p>For the past five years, with varying regularity, three or four protesters have turned up at the side of a busy road in Brighton. They hoist placards bearing graphic images of aborted foetuses alongside the redbrick walls of Wistons clinic and accost every woman going through the gates, pushing pamphlets into their hands and urging them to \"look into the face\" of their unborn child.</p> <p>The leaflets bear more bloody images alongside dubious medical claims and stories including one of how a 12-year-old incest victim found her life radically improved when she kept her baby.</p> <p>The demonstrations, by two Christian groups with links to American anti-abortion campaigns, have been the subject of a petition against their tactics, signed by two of the city's MPs and cross-party councillors who have been inundated with complaints. Police arrested two protesters who were last month found not guilty of public order offences.</p> <p>In the UK such hardline protests have generally been small, but this weekend's return to the abortion limit debate by three senior cabinet ministers, and now the prime minister, has reopened the deeply impassioned debate which many had thought was long settled. Many believe it will encourage further aggressive tactics against women, some of whom may be particularly vulnerable, seeking legal medical treatment.</p> <p>It began with Maria Miller, the minister for women, saying she would like a 20-week limit instead of the current 24. She said she wanted to protect women from the trauma of later abortions. Yesterday morning home secretary Theresa May said she, too, favoured 20 weeks and by the afternoon David Cameron had backed a reduction in the present limit. All stressed they were expressing personal opinions and there was no government policy to change legislation.</p> <p>But it was Jeremy Hunt, as health secretary, who in an interview with the <em>Times</em> said: \"Everyone looks at the evidence and comes to a view about when they think that moment is, and my view is that 12 weeks is the right point for it. It is just my view about that incredibly difficult question about the moment that we should deem life to start.\" He added: \"I don't think the reason I have that view is for religious reasons.\"</p> <p>Those comments incensed those under the remit of his own department who pointed out furiously that, even aside from the issue of a woman's right to choose, by 12 weeks many of the congenital abnormalities or other defects in a foetus that might lead to a medical abortion were not yet detectable. \"The science doesn't back him, no matter what he might be implying,\" said Clare Murphy, spokeswoman of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS).</p> <p>Writing in the <em>Observer</em>, Lord Steel, the architect of the 1967 Abortion Act, which allowed access to safe and legal abortion, said the clock had been \"turned back\" for women.</p> <p>Abortion statistics have remained mostly static \u2013 last year 190,000 abortions took place in England and Wales in 2011, a figure that has changed little in a decade. The vast majority took place at less than 10 weeks, with one in 10 taking place at over 13 weeks.</p> <p>Dr Kate Guthrie, spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said the comments by Hunt \"politicise the debate around the abortion time limit and do not put women at the centre of their care\".</p> <p>She questioned the basis for Hunt's reference to making his decision after looking at evidence. \"What evidence is he thinking of? I can't think of anything. Reducing the time limit to 12 weeks would severely limit women's choice at an extremely difficult time in their life.\" She added: \"If the intention is to reduce the abortion rate, then health services should invest in the provision of comprehensive contraceptive services that improve access and provide women with a range of options.\"</p> <p>She said doctors reported that there were many reasons why some women had abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy. These include an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy that was only picked up at a later gestation, late referral to abortion services, or a scan showing foetal abnormality. Some medical conditions are only picked up later in pregnancy while there are also social reasons that impact on a woman's decision, including changes to her personal or financial circumstances.</p> <p>Campaigners say around half of all women who have abortions are already mothers, and 49% are in relationships. \"So they really are making a decision not just for themselves but also for their families,\" said Murphy. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service carries out the majority of the post-20-week abortions in England and Wales.</p> <p>\"I don't use the word vulnerable lightly but they are often at their most vulnerable. To hear that the health secretary and the minister for women feel at liberty to pick on this group of women is appalling.</p> <p>\"It is appropriate for them to have their own personal convictions, but it is not appropriate for them to misuse science to bolster those convictions. They may have their moral qualms but they are not entitled to transpose those moral qualms on to scientists and on to women.\"</p> <p>Diane Abbott, shadow health minister, said Hunt was using abortion as an issue to win support within the Tory party. She said it was an ideological attack on science and that it was \"pretty shocking that leading Tory politicians are lining up to attack women's reproductive rights on the basis of no support in the medical community.</p> <p>\"There is no evidence to support a reduction in the abortion time limit and this view is supported across the medical profession. Late abortion only affects a small number of women, who are often in extremely challenging circumstances.\"</p> <p>And indeed the row immediately galvanised calls for an official debate. Tory MP Mark Pritchard, vice-chairman of the parliamentary pro-life group, said that it was time for an \"up-to-date\" national discussion.</p> <p>\"The law currently lags behind recent scientific breakthroughs, where the survivability of young babies has increased greatly. It is time for the government to make time for a full debate on the issue. It is a tragic irony that at one end of a hospital taxpayers are paying for the termination of babies, whilst at the other end of the same hospital, taxpayers are paying to create babies through IVF.\"</p> <p>Hunt's comments, on the eve of the Conservative party conference in Birmingham, were also welcomed by Tory backbencher Daniel Kawczynski who said there were MPs of all parties who backed a change in the law.</p> <p>\"The health secretary coming out in favour of reigniting this debate will galvanise the caucus that exists in parliament. There will be many of us who will never stop campaigning to reduce the limit,\" Kawczynski said.</p> <p>The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the British Medical Association said there was no change in science or in the medical opinion around abortion since the previous move to reduce the limit in 2008 which was defeated in parliament.</p> <p>Around 1% of babies who are born at 22 weeks survive, although not without disability or serious health issues, which is thought to be why some feel unsettled by the present limit.</p> <p>Professor Wendy Savage, a gynaecologist and campaigner, has defended the \"very small\" number of abortions that take place over 20 weeks and said a considerable proportion are of foetuses with a congenital abnormality, some of which will not be picked up until a late stage in the pregnancy. \"I think the majority of the population think that if somebody has got a foetus that, if born, will have a severe disability, they should have the right to choose whether or not to continue with that pregnancy,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>More than one in five of Britain's largest corporations are channelling political donations to favoured candidates ahead of next month's elections in the US \u2013 though these sums may be only the tip of a new campaign-financing iceberg, according to leading politicians, judges and pro-transparency watchdogs.</p> <p>As election year reaches its climax, America is forecast to experience the most extensively corporate-influenced race for the White House, and for control of Capitol Hill, in living memory.</p> <p>Among the industries already well versed in bankrolling US politics are finance, pharmaceuticals, energy and defence. British multinationals such as HSBC, Barclays, Experian, Prudential, GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, BP, Shell and BAE all have political action committees (PACs) that channel donations from employees to US politicians.</p> <p>Some 14 of the top 50 most active foreign-controlled PACs have parent groups listed in London, according to Washington group the Centre for Responsive Politics. This makes the UK the biggest hub for non-US multinationals seeking to exert influence at the US ballot box on 6 November. Despite this, some FTSE 100 groups continue to tell shareholders in annual reports and elsewhere that they do not make political donations.</p> <p>Companies are able to make such claims because PACs receive their funds from US employees \u2013 often led by the most senior American executives \u2013 and only dip into company coffers to cover administrative costs. Typically, the PACs are staffed by company lobbyists and distribute campaign contributions in line with the company's lobbying agenda.</p> <p>Recent supreme court rulings have transformed the regulatory landscape for corporations seeking to bring their influence to bear. So concerned has President Obama become that he raised the issue in his state of the union address two years ago: \"I believe [the rulings] will open the floodgates for special interests \u2013 including foreign corporations \u2013 to spend without limit in our elections.\"</p> <p>While investor attitudes in Europe have been hardening against public companies helping to finance campaigns, the trend is markedly in the opposite direction in the US. Transparency campaigners fear many tens of millions of dollars in \"dark money\" \u2013 that is, expenditure that need not be disclosed because it is not directly funding individual candidates \u2013 is already seeping into the American electoral process, raising the spectre of compromised democracy, even corruption. \"The door has been pushed wide open to the abuses we had during Watergate,\" says Bruce Freed, president of the Washington-based Centre for Political Accountability. \"Company shakedowns, massive amounts of money being given privately and much more.\"</p> <p>PAC activity has largely been overlooked by UK governance groups because sums involved have been small. There are tight caps both on money-flows into and out of PACs. For example, even the most active FTSE 100-linked PAC, sponsored by BAE, has only released $609,750 in the 2012 election race, of which 61% has gone to Republican candidates.</p> <p>Moreover, the strict disclosure regime ensures it is possible to pore over Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings to see who gives to which PAC. Linda Hudson, BAE's top US executive, and her chief lobbyist, Erin Moseley, for example, are big donors to their company PAC.</p> <p>Other high-profile donors include Experian chief executive Don Robert, who contributed to the credit check group's 78% Republican-leaning PAC; BP chief executive Bob Dudley, who gives to the oil major's 71% Republican-leaning PAC; and former AstraZeneca chief executive David Brennan, who, until he resigned in April, gave to the group's 54% Republican-leaning PAC.</p> <p>Meanwhile, politicians who receive PAC cash are also there in FEC filings for all to see. Fourteen members of the 21-strong Congressional armed services subcommittee on readiness, for example, received money from BAE's PAC.</p> <p>Few PACs linked to FTSE 100 firms have given directly to presidential candidates, but one exception is Citizens Financial, a committee backed by the US banking subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland. Despite RBS being 84% owned by the UK taxpayer, its PAC has channelled $2,500 to Mitt Romney. Asked if the bank thought this was appropriate, a spokesman said: \"This is not company money. These are voluntary staff contributions and this is standard practice in the US.\"</p> <p>George Dallas, the corporate governance director at UK asset manager F&amp;C, also sits as chairman of the business ethics committee of the International Corporate Governance Network, an organisation whose 500-plus members have $18tn under management. \"Our position is we basically discourage financial donations because once you start to bring money into the equation, the black and white can turn to grey,\" he explains.</p> <p>\"But if you are going to sponsor a PAC there should be disclosures about this. We are not sticking our heads in the sand; we know that companies in the US are going to make political expenditures because that is the way things work in the US. And while we might discourage it, we say: 'If you're going to do it, this full disclosure is the way forward'.\"</p> <p>RBS's annual report tells investors: \"The Group made no political donations, nor incurred any political expenditure in the UK or EU.\" Like many FTSE 100 firms, it does not refer to political engagement outside Europe.</p> <p>Whatever the eccentricities of the PAC system, it has ensured that much corporate spending has remained transparent and comparatively small scale for many years. But the landscape changed radically two years ago, largely as a consequence of the controversial Supreme Court ruling in <em>Citizens United v FEC</em>. The ruling found that a corporation's first amendment right to freedom of speech trumped rules that sought to keep in check the influence of big business on American democracy.</p> <p>Effectively, the decision \u2013 which split the court five-four \u2013 opened the door for companies or trade associations to spend more freely on publicity campaigns attacking, or supporting, policies associated with candidates. Though the law still prohibits businesses from giving directly from shareholder funds to a candidate's official war chest in federal elections, a way of working around that ban has effectively been established in law.</p> <p>In his dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens said the decision \"will undoubtedly cripple the ability of ordinary citizens, Congress, and the states to adopt even limited measures to protect against corporate domination of the electoral process.\"</p> <p>Some transparency campaigners have suggested there is already plenty of evidence of such corporate domination right from the mid-term elections which took place only a few months after the 2010 Citizens United ruling.</p> <p>One example cited is the financing that the American Petroleum Institute (API) reportedly provided for a pre-election TV advert by Americans for Tax Reform, in which viewers were told Pennsylvanian congressman Joe Sestak \"voted for Pelosi's job-killing cap-and-trade plan\". The ad said the initiative from Democrat minority house leader Nancy Pelosi constituted \"a great big tax that would make utility bills skyrocket, gas prices soar\". Sestak lost a bid for Senate and his congressional seat fell to a Republican.</p> <p>More recently the API funded an advert targeting Missouri Democrat senator Claire McCaskill. It reportedly stated that her opposition to oil subsidies would raise petrol prices. The advert audience were told: \"Senator McCaskill, higher taxes won't lower gas prices ... Tell her American's can't afford to pay more\".</p> <p>Members of the API include BP, and the oil group's top US executive, Lamar McKay, sits as a director of the trade body. A BP spokesman said US energy policy issues \"impact on how we operate in the US and the jobs of our 23,000 US employees, so it is natural for many of BP's US citizens to choose to be politically active and for the company to support energy trade groups.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Our employees' voluntary participation in political action committees, our lobbying and trade association memberships are all publicly reported in accordance with US law.\" BP's ethical policy on business conduct reads: \"BP will never make political contributions, whether in cash or kind, to any political party or to organisations or individuals whose activities are designed to promote the interests of political parties.\"</p> <p>Next week's Diageo AGM presents investors with an opportunity to take a stand. As one of the few FTSE 100 companies both to sponsor a PAC and make direct donations in some US state elections, the company will ask shareholders at their annual meeting to support a routine resolution authorising political donations in the EU.</p> <p>The Guinness brewer made US donations of \u00a3400,000 last year, which it says \"were all made, consistent with applicable laws, to federal and state candidates and committees in North America, where it is common practice to make political contributions\".</p> <p>However, governance group Pirc is urging a \"no\" vote on the resolution, even though it only applies to the EU, noting: \"Political donations are not considered to be an appropriate use of shareholders' funds.\"</p> <p>So far, few UK institutional investors have shown much appetite for kicking back against this issue \u2013 but it may come back to haunt them.</p>",
  "<p>Back in 1968, Mick Jagger sang, \"I don't care that you're 15 years old, I don't want to see no ID,\" on the Rolling Stones' <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2obHLK6iW7g\" title=\"\">Stray Cat Blues</a>, \"It ain't no hangin' matter, ain't no capital crime...\"</p> <p>Needless to say, the Stones don't perform this song in concert any more, and the last time they did, the lyric was subtly amended to \"16\". Who knew at the time that it would be the band's bassist Bill Wyman, rather than Jagger, who would later play out the song out in real life, eventually marrying Mandy Smith (when she was 19 and he was 53), or that their post-divorce punchline would be the wedding of Wyman's son to Smith's mother?</p> <p>Another song you don't hear much nowadays is a once-popular blues standard that was first recorded in 1937 by the first of the two harmonica-playing Mississippi bluesmen to use the name Sonny Boy Williamson. Its opening lines were \"Good morning little schoolgirl, can I come home with you? Tell your mama and your papa I'm a little schoolboy too.\" In 1964, a version of that song was Rod Stewart's first solo single and it has also been recorded by Chuck Berry (no surprise there, really), Van Morrison, Huey Lewis, Paul Rodgers and numerous blues greats including Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker. But not lately.</p> <p>Yet, even leaving aside the rough-and-ready worlds of the blues and post-blues hard rock, it's not hard to understand why the early days of pop and rock'n'roll included so many songs about teenage girls.</p> <p>In the 1950s and 1960s, when the music was a relatively new phenomenon, its audience consisted primarily of teenagers and those in their early 20s; teen romance was its principal lyrical topic and songs about teenage girls sold well both to teenage girls themselves and to their boyfriends. Teen angels were rockin' at the high-school hop: either to songs borrowed from rhythm and blues and written and performed by and for black adults or to songs specifically aimed at teens seeking passage into adulthood.</p> <p>Chuck Berry's Almost Grown began, \"Well, I'm doin' all right in school\" and its punchline, \"Don't bother us, leave us alone, anyway we almost grown\", was perfect for teenagers in 1959.</p> <p>Berry himself \u2013 who later served two years in prison for transporting a 14-year-old girl across a state line \u2013 was 33 at the time. Yet many of those who wrote and performed the songs were not that much older than their subjects. The first line of the first song on the first Beatles album may have been, \"She was just 17, you know what I mean\", but when it was recorded and released, the youngest Beatle, George Harrison, was only 20 and Paul McCartney, who wrote it, had barely turned 21. Nevertheless, it is sobering to note, when viewing the Beatles' 1964 movie <em>A Hard Day's Night</em> today, that Pattie Boyd, whom Harrison met on set and later married, appears in the role of a schoolgirl, costumed in classic 1960s school uniform.</p> <p>After all, from time immemorial, a large part of the pop industry has been devoted to selling pretty young men to younger girls. From Frank Sinatra in the 1940s, Elvis Presley in the 1950s, the Beatles and the Stones in the 1960s, David Cassidy and the Osmonds (or, for the smarter kids, David Bowie and Marc Bolan) in the 1970s through to Take That in the 1990s and Justin Bieber or the latest <em>X-Factor</em> cutie-pie today, the transaction seemed fairly straightforward \u2026 on paper, at least.</p> <p>The music industry got a hefty slice of pocket money (or parents' disposable income); in exchange, the audience got artefacts such as records, posters and concert tickets and an opportunity to explore burgeoning sexuality via a fantasy of remote, safe-distance virtual boyfriends.</p> <p>Things got complicated when the safe distance disappeared, the love-object was no longer remote, the attraction was reciprocated and industry intermediaries (most of whom were neither as young nor as pretty as the stars) used the reflected glory of the pop and rock idols to interpose themselves into the mix.</p> <p>They could use the promise of access to the Loved Ones \u2013 not to mention drugs, alcohol or outright threats \u2013 as leverage to indulge fantasies of their own in ways that could, and often did, turn incredibly ugly. As ugly, in fact, as many of the main culprits, few of whom could have gotten within spitting distance of their prey were they forced to depend solely on their own talents, charm or appearance as means of attraction.</p> <p>Jimmy Savile OBE was a very different proposition from Jimmy Page OBE who, in the Hollywood Babylon of the early 1970s, had girls less than half his age fist-fighting for his favours. Nevertheless, even though there was no coercion involved, the question of whether or not the Led Zeppelin guitarist should have accepted their devoted attentions, however freely offered, was one that pop had already been addressing for a decade.</p> <p>In<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b53EbA1NBRk\" title=\"\"> Younger Girl</a>, the Lovin' Spoonful's John Sebastian had mused, \"And should I hang around acting like a brother? In a few more years they'll say we're right for each other.\" And in the breastbeating 1968 chart-topper Young Girl, Union Gap's Gary Puckett discovered, just in time, that his sweetie was the wrong side of the age line and sobbingly sent her back to mother.</p> <p>For those coming of age in the Deep South of the 1950s, both custom and law were breathtakingly different. Elvis Presley, serving overseas in the US army, began romancing his commanding officer's daughter, nine years his junior, when she was a mere 14, though the relationship went unconsummated until their marriage six years later. Jerry Lee Lewis, famously, not only married his second cousin when she was 14, but did so before his divorce from his previous wife was finalised. He paid for this transgression not in court or jail, but with a decade in the career wilderness.</p> <p>Some things were just plain unacceptable even when buttoned-up 1950s prudery was beginning its retreat.</p> <p>So: are we projecting modern attitudes back into a very different time? Yes, we are. Are we right to do so? Yes, we are. Many things once considered \"normal\" \u2013 ranging from institutional racism and legal suppression of homosexuality to drinking and driving or smoking in public places \u2013 are now proscribed, and we are, both as a culture and as individuals, better for it.</p> <p>Quite simply, we know better now, and these days most grownups, thankfully, act on that knowledge. In the supremely unlikely event that your correspondent were to be hit on by a naked 14-year-old, I'd make like Gary Puckett, throw a coat over her and send her in a cab back to her mother.</p> <p>And this would hold true even if we were in Spain, where the legal age of consent is 13. Or anywhere else on the planet where both law and custom differ radically from ours.</p>",
  "<p>'Romney wanted to be there; Obama didn't want to be there,\" was the pithy verdict on last week's presidential debate from James Carville, who helped put Bill Clinton into the White House in 1992. You simply can't argue with that. Obama seemed frazzled, undernourished and almost disengaged from the policies that are closest to his heart. You wondered if this man actually wanted to win the election. Does he have the stomach for another four years?</p> <p>Anyone who has died on stage, or flopped in front of a TV audience, will have felt for him. I looked away from the debate, feeling awkward and was rather amazed to hear what sounded like Obama debating Reagan, not Romney \u2013 a plausible, slightly folksy voice pushing moderate conservatism. That's no surprise \u2013 Mitt Romney is consciously channelling the last Republican hero and it represents a real danger for Obama.</p> <p>Much research has been done on the impact presidential debates have on undecided voters. The orthodoxy is that the debates don't matter very much and that the candidate with a lead in the polls after the first debate, as Obama still has, wins the majority in the electoral college, which means that nothing that happens in the subsequent debates on 16 and 22 October should affect the outcome.</p> <p>But it's certainly not a done deal in 2012. Obama's lead was cut to two points after the debate, though his week was somewhat saved by an unemployment rate that sank below 8%, the lowest since he took office.</p> <p>What matters as much as the candidates' performance is the narrative in the media. A study on the 2004 clash between George Bush and John Kerry shows that the media vastly influenced the perception about who won. Those shown no commentary after the debate believed Kerry had won, whereas those watching NBC coverage, which praised Bush's performance, insisted that Bush had won.</p> <p>The debates usually allow for some latitude in interpretation and both sides find something to take away, but Obama was so dramatically underpowered, so underwhelming and dreary that the American media unhesitatingly awarded the bout to Romney. He seemed top dog in all respects: he looked better, spoke better (541 more words than Obama with four fewer minutes speaking time, to be exact) and appeared in command of the agenda. By contrast, Obama missed the target several times, but mostly didn't try to hit it.</p> <p>This may be the pivotal moment of the campaign, which will not properly register in the polls until after the next debate. The truisms that a challenger is simply running for election, while the incumbent is running a country as well, and that the serving president comes to the platform with a grim realism about the job and intractability of so many problems count for something. The challenger is relatively fresh; he has less to lose and he has the president's record to aim at. But these advantages on Romney's side do not account for the wipe-out in Denver.</p> <p>Al Gore ventured (unhelpfully) that Obama had not acclimatised to Denver being 5,000 feet above sea level while an American friend of mine wondered if the diet-conscious president was suffering from low blood sugar, which is to say, the lack of a good steak dinner before the 90-minute debate.</p> <p>Something was wrong, although a letter in the <em>New York Times</em> suggested that if you listened to the debate, rather than watched it, Obama was the clear victor. But the \"optics versus substance\" argument is beside the point because 67.2 million Americans watched the debate, and a recent MIT study has shown that an energetic, good-looking candidate benefits from the debates, \"with new support coming from less informed voters\".</p> <p>That the president is black, that he seemed dog tired and often glanced at his notes when Romney was speaking had an uncomfortable but rarely acknowledged resonance in the US. I am sorry to have mention this, but the contrast between the black guy, momentarily off his game and looking downwards, and the white guy, all crisp, clear-eyed and on top of things, will register in the subconscious of an electorate that is far from being free of racism.</p> <p>But whatever the subliminal traffic of the debate, there is no doubt that Obama conceded important territory by allowing Romney to stake a claim for the presidency as a unifying figure, the candidate who, despite his privileged background, tax records, offshore bank accounts and the export of American jobs to China, could heal the rift in American politics.</p> <p>Romney sold his record as governor in Massachusetts, where he worked with a large Democrat majority, as the qualification for ending the logjam in Washington: he was the man to walk across the aisle and do business with the other side.</p> <p>While incanting the creed that espouses individual choice and enterprise over big government and centralised authority, Romney shifted to the centre ground and simultaneously implied that Obama was, in fact, the divisive figure of US politics. A successful completion of this move may be as dangerous to Obama as the spooky invocation of Ronald Wilson Reagan.</p> <p>Does Obama's poor performance last week indicate a subconscious desire to quit the White House and withdraw to Harvard or Chicago to write books? He could be forgiven. In December, the US government faces what the Federal Reserve chief, Ben Bernanke, has called the fiscal cliff, the expiration of tax breaks and the beginning of deep budget cuts, which will increase federal revenues by about 19%, yet will plunge the US into a double-dip recession.</p> <p>Faced with the choice between debt and recession, the government will eventually opt for the first, but the result of either course is not good. In addition, the victor will face the fallout from Europe's economic problems, Iran's nuclear ambitions and the poisonous atmosphere in Washington DC, which certainly won't be at ease with an Obama victory.</p> <p>For an individual such as Obama who is not wholly a freak or narcissist, the job entails unique psychic fatigue, which <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/10/michael-lewis-profile-barack-obama\" title=\"\">Obama hinted at when he spoke to Michael Lewis in <em>Vanity Fair</em></a>. He talked of the toxic nature of cable news and some research that showed the simple act of taking decisions \u2013 even what to wear or what to eat \u2013 degraded one's ability to take further decisions.</p> <p>But judging by his punchy speeches at the end of last week, Obama still has an appetite for the job. Something that is forgotten in all the performance reviews of Denver is that the debate brought out the ideological differences of the two men in vivid detail. Simply watching Romney pretend that he has not promised $5tn in tax breaks to the wealthy and obfuscate on welfare cuts will surely be enough to inspire Obama. He had an off day \u2013 we all do \u2013 but now the race is too close to call.</p>",
  "<p>Drones will be commonplace in the skies above the UK within a decade, according to a European commission document suggesting that hundreds of firms will develop new uses for them.</p> <p>But the claims have prompted concerns from civil liberties groups, who fear that the unmanned aircraft will result in more forms of surveillance. Some 95% of drones in operation are used by the military, but the document notes they now also have \"great potential for civil applications\".</p> <p>The commission's working paper, <a href=\"http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/12/st13/st13438.en12.pdf\" title=\"\">Towards a European Strategy for the Development of Civil Applications of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems</a>, claims there are some 400 civilian drone applications in development across the EU. This number is expected to rise in the next decade.</p> <p>It is estimated that 35,000 drones will be produced worldwide in the next 10 years. Currently the US and Israel produce two-thirds of drones, while Europe produces fewer than 10%.</p> <p>So far, non-military drone use is rare. Merseyside police bought a \u00a313,000 drone that crashed into the Mersey last year. Kent police are also reportedly working on a \u00a33m\u2009project to use unmanned aircraft to patrol the coast.</p> <p>Possible uses of civilian drones cited in the commission document include using them for \"risky flights into ash clouds or in proximity of nuclear or chemical plants after major incidents\". It also suggests drones could be used in crisis management, law enforcement, border control and firefighting.</p> <p>In commerce hundreds of uses have been identified \"in precision agriculture and fisheries, power/gas line monitoring, infrastructure inspection, communications and broadcasting, wireless communication relay and satellite augmentation systems, natural resources monitoring, media/entertainment, digital mapping, land and wildlife management, air quality management\". The paper says knowledge of drones' abilities \"will quickly spread among potential users, creating new markets of aerial services in the same way that the iPad created an entirely new and unpredicted market for mobile data services\".</p> <p>But campaigners warned that the new generation of drones could have profound consequences for civil liberties. \"With the use of drones in European airspace spiralling, we urgently need greater clarity and transparency about when and how these tools are deployed,\" said Eric King of Privacy International.</p> <p>\"Not too long ago, this was the stuff of science fiction, but flying robotic devices equipped with facial recognition technology and mobile phone interception kit are increasingly commonplace.</p> <p>\"However, the secretive way in which surveillance drones have been put into operation, and the failure of the police to recognise and address the human rights issues involved, has created a huge potential for abuse.\"</p> <p>The rush to develop the technology has also brought safety concerns. A report by the US government accountability office warns that Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) lack the technological and operational standards \"needed to guide safe and consistent performance of UAS\".</p> <p>The US government accountability office also acknowledged that there were privacy concerns including \"the potential for increased amounts of government surveillance using technologies placed on UAS, the collection and use of such data, and potential violations of constitutional Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizures\".The EC document urges member states to develop a common, comprehensive plan, similar to the regulatory strategy being rolled out in the US, to ensure drones become a common part of air traffic by 2016.</p> <p>\"The UK doesn't have a proper road map [for the roll out of drones]; its existing roadmap was written in 2005 and it's too old,\" said Mahendran Arjunraja, senior research analyst at Frost &amp; Sullivan, a global market consultancy. \"Safety issues are paramount. We will soon have civilian UAVs sharing airspace with airplanes,\" Arjunraja said. \"There is a need to develop sense-and-avoid technology so the UAS don't crash into aeroplanes. We should see this technology being rolled out within the next 10 years.\"</p>",
  "<p>The government is studying plans to slash compensation for people injured by criminals, including the children of murder victims, despite mounting opposition from within its own ranks.</p> <p>Ministers want to cut a quarter of the \u00a3200m awarded annually by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme in a move that several Tory MPs, including John Redwood, lawyers and trade unions have strongly criticised.</p> <p>The government claims the current scheme is too bureaucratic and means many people end up waiting years for compensation. There have also been claims that the scheme has been exploited by undeserving claimants.</p> <p>According to the government's impact assessment, almost half of victims currently eligible for compensation \u2013 including people attacked by dogs \u2013 would receive nothing if the reforms go through. In addition, payments would be cut by up to 60% for the third of victims who suffer severe injuries. The Communication Workers Union, which represents postal workers, said each year 1,000 of its members receive between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,000 from the scheme after being attacked by dogs belonging to irresponsible owners.</p> <p>\"The scheme is a last resort, but it's better than nothing,\" said Dave Joyce, the union's national health and safety officer. \"But if these proposals go through, then our people will end up with nothing.\"</p> <p>Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, said the reforms would cut payments to seriously injured victims by capping compensation for loss of earnings at \u00a34,500 a year. Usdaw's general secretary, John Hannett, cited the case of a shopworker who was attacked by a shoplifter and was left with blurred vision, stress and anxiety, forcing her to take weeks off work.</p> <p>\"Usdaw won that woman \u00a32,000 from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. Under the new plan she would get nothing,\" Hannett said. \"Is that the sort of justice the coalition believes in?\"</p> <p>Under the current proposals, employees would only receive statutory sick pay of \u00a385.85 a week while unable to work.</p> <p>The scheme also reduces compensation for potential loss of earnings. Mark Miller, 27, was left with a brain injury following a random attack in Swansea in 2008. The scheme awarded him \u00a3246,000, of which \u00a3190,000 was for loss of potential earnings because he could not complete his degree and now has a limited capacity to work. Under the new proposals, his solicitor said he would be awarded around \u00a380,000 for loss of earnings \u2013 a cut of nearly 70%.</p> <p>New conditions would also be applied to awards to the dependent spouses or children of murder and manslaughter victims, who would no longer be entitled to claim a significant proportion of their deceased parent's or spouse's salary.</p> <p>When the proposed reforms went before a special parliamentary committee last month they were opposed by MPs from all parties. It was the first time the delegated legislation committee had forced a government retreat in 50 years.</p> <p>Tory MP John Redwood said: \"I have never been shy about saying that I would like us as a government to spend less overall, but I never once thought it had to be done by cutting something so sensitive or giving a worse deal to the disabled, the poor or the most vulnerable.\"</p> <p>However, justice secretary Chris Grayling said there was no case \"for targeting resources at minor injuries that do not have a significant effect on the lives of those affected\" and promised to \"concentrate resources on people who suffer life-changing circumstances\".</p> <p>The government has until 22 October to confirm its intentions.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Justice said: \"Ministers have listened carefully to the concerns raised in parliament and are considering their next steps in light of this. No decision has been taken.\"</p> <p>Neil Sugarman, of the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers, said: \"We remain deeply concerned that the government will still try to find a way to bring it back in 'under the radar'. In its present form, it would undoubtedly hit children, vulnerable and disabled people the hardest.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>BAE Systems and the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) specialise in building products of staggering complexity, with a seemingly infinite number of moving parts. This at least improves their chances of meeting Wednesday's Takeover Panel deadline for thrashing out the terms of an ambitious \u20ac35bn (\u00a328bn) merger between the UK's largest defence contractor and the owner of&#xa0;Airbus.</p> <p>But in this case the challenge is political. Last week saw fresh bouts of upheaval in the corridors of power over a combination of two companies in which the UK, French, German, US and Spanish governments all have close involvement.</p> <p>The main bone of contention, which the groups hope to resolve this week, is the direct and indirect shareholdings in EADS owned by Paris and Berlin. Neither government wants to dilute its influence over the company \u2013 a big employer in France and Germany \u2013 if it gives the other an advantage. Both control 22.35% of EADS, but that could be reduced to stakes of 9% each in the new business under one proposal.</p> <p>The UK state's interest in BAE Systems is represented by a \"golden share\", which has a symbolic value of \u00a31 and prevents non-UK shareholders from owning more than 15% of the business. That will be converted into a golden share in the new company, but there will be no equity stake akin to France's or Germany's.</p> <p>This has riled 45 Conservative MPs, who wrote to David Cameron last week warning that he must \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/05/tory-mps-rebel-bae-merger\" title=\"\">safeguard Britain's national security and economic interests</a>\". The proposed French and German shareholdings are also a problem, the MPs warned. \"It would be naive to think that, if those two governments held a significant shareholding in the new company, they would not continue to meddle.\"</p> <p>Despite these concerns, Downing Street seems broadly happy with the deal, and sources familiar with the talks say they have found the UK government less intractable than its counterparts in Paris and Berlin. But that is not enough to ensure that the Wednesday deadline is met, or that the granting of an extension by the Takeover Panel \u2013 a relative formality \u2013 will bring the parties closer together.</p> <p>There were reports from Germany last week that intergovernmental talks over the transaction have nearly collapsed. Some non-state shareholders, led by French conglomerate Lagard\u00e8re, have also questioned its financial merits. If this deal fails, it will have been stifled in the corridors of power.</p>",
  "<p>There is no doubt that the row over a group of tiny islands in the East China Sea has sealed the deterioration in relations between China and Japan. The diplomatic spat over the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands, which sparked violent protests, with Japanese flags and factories burned, stunned Tokyo, and caused Japanese companies to consider scrapping investment plans in China. Why open a new factory, they ask, just for it to be firebombed or defaced while an acquiescent administration turns a blind eye?</p> <p>Until recently the \"one-plus-one\" investment policy (for every factory built in Japan, companies also had to build one overseas) benefited China. But now insiders say firms will look to support growth in Indonesia, the Philippines or newly open Burma.</p> <p>For the International Monetary Fund, which has taken its annual meeting to the Japanese capital for the first time since 1964, the dispute is one of many linked to slowing growth and a rise in protectionism.</p> <p>This week's meeting was scheduled for Cairo, until the Arab spring made the region look too unstable for a gathering of finance ministers and global institutions. But with Chinese frigates circling the disputed islands and pleas for calm going unheeded, Tokyo's political situation is closer to Cairo's than the IMF expected.</p> <p>China's leaders are undoubtedly under pressure. Growth has slowed from more than 10% to less than 8% over the past two years, but its rising population means that growth of between 6% and 7% is needed just to keep pace. In March, Beijing cut its growth target for the whole of 2012 to 7.5%. As any student of politics knows, a foreign dispute distracts attention from failing economic policies.</p> <p>But opting for a short-term boost in domestic popularity over a deterioration in long-term relations with foreign investors looks to be a huge mistake by the Beijing authorities. And the IMF understands that this local dispute has much wider ramifications: after all, Japan is the world's third-largest economy and China, its second-biggest, accounts for about a fifth of the world's total economic output. Any slowdown is going to hamper a global recovery.</p> <p>The Americans have already put the brakes on expansion in China, in reaction to general corruption and to the growing threat from intellectual property theft. European companies have also backed off, preferring to send in high-value goods made at home.</p> <p>Japan's economy is not in great shape either. This year, colossal spending on imported gas and oil will send the balance of payments into reverse for only the second time in three decades. The yen is at a historic high against the dollar, making Japanese products expensive abroad, and the political situation remains unstable, with the Democratic party government able to push through a VAT rise only on a promise of early elections.</p> <p>And let's not forget the eurozone crisis. That continues to provide plenty of food for thought for IMF officials, given the failure to deal with Spain's financial black hole and growing public unrest among southern Europe's increasingly desperate citizens.</p> <p>Yet it is the Japan/China dispute that is worrying them most. Japan believes the Chinese are wilfully making trouble: it has stressed that it bought the islands earlier this year to keep them out of the hands of the mayor of Tokyo, a Boris Johnson-style character with a populist enmity towards the Chinese community in Japan.</p> <p>Maybe Beijing thinks it can go it alone without Japanese investment. It would be wrong, and the decision could have implications for us all.</p> <h2>Have women had their quota of being kept down?</h2> <p>What does it take to get more women into the boardroom? Compulsory quotas? This is always presented as the nuclear option and women who have managed to bust through the glass ceiling are by and large against them.</p> <p>Last week, announcing her decision to leave <em>Financial Times</em> owner Pearson after 15 years in charge, Dame Marjorie Scardino said: \"I thought, in 1997, that by the time I left Pearson, things would be different in terms of the number of chief executives and board members who are women. It's not really too different and, for that, I'm sorry.\"</p> <p>It had been hoped that Scardino, the first woman to run a FTSE 100 company, would be the first of many, but there have never been more than five female FTSE 100 bosses at any one time. Yet Scardino rejected quotas: \"You should choose people on the basis of their abilities. Not on the basis of things they can't do anything about.\"</p> <p>But doesn't the under-representation of women in the City \u2013 they still occupy fewer than one in five FTSE 100 boardroom seats \u2013 suggest their \"abilities\" are being overlooked?</p> <p>Last year, a government inquiry led by Lord Davies of Abersoch set a target of 25% female representation on FTSE boards by 2015. Companies were told to act or face eventual quotas. There was a flurry of appointments of women to FTSE boards, but a worrying proportion of them were in part-time, non-executive roles.</p> <p>Last month Royal Mail's Canadian boss, Moya Greene, told a conference that the pace of change in this country was \"glacial\". When she started in the Canadian civil service, no woman taking a senior role could be married. Progress came thanks to quotas. \"Unless you have quotas and live by them,\" she said, \"you won't see change.\"</p> <p>Strong stuff. But the government is fighting an EU move to impose a 40% female quota for large company boards, arguing that national schemes should be given a chance. At what point should women start to lose patience? After all, 15 years is a long time.</p> <h2>For BAE and EADS, two into three won't go</h2> <p>So much for Tom Enders's and Ian King's vision that an EADS/BAE Systems combo would be a depoliticised company. For the past week, all the debate has been about how great a slice of the shares the French and German governments will retain, or at least control. \"A lot\" seems to be the short answer \u2013 maybe 9% each. By contrast, it is envisaged that the UK would rub along with only a golden share to protect national security and act as a veto on a change of control. Former chancellor Alistair Darling doesn't like the smell of it.</p> <p>\"We will be taken to the cleaners,\" he told the <em>FT</em>. \"I don't see how you could have a large new company like this with the French and German governments having large direct and indirect stakes and we have none.\"</p> <p>Darling is right. It is relatively easy to accept that BAE, in the face of shrinking defence budgets, needs to do something. The logic of a grand European defence-and-aerospace company is also sound. But a three-way alliance will work only if all three sponsoring governments have equal standing. Any other arrangement invites years of squabbling over jobs and investment and accusations of political interference. The two chief executives want a business that operates \"in a normal commercial manner and which confers the same rights on all shareholders, large and small\". That won't happen if two governments, but not the third, have large shareholdings.</p>",
  "<p>The key insight of Will Hutton \u2013 \"The company has become a dysfunctional organisational construct that needs root-and-branch reform\" was even more important than the headline on his piece \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/30/will-hutton-new-model-capitalism\" title=\"\">We need a revolution in how our companies are owned and run</a>\" (Comment).</p> <p>In the 1860s, the UK parliament and courts were leaders in the early development of company law, nationally and internationally. Company law facilitated business projects which would otherwise never have been undertaken. It was unambiguously a \"Good Thing\". But it has now grown to become a worldwide cancer, eating away at personal and political responsibility, at the effectiveness of taxation, the requirements of social justice and sound industrial relations.</p> <p>Will Hutton is right: root-and-branch legal reform is essential, now as an international priority. New Labour embarked on such reform in 1997, but the project was crippled by political compromise and nothing of significance was achieved. Labour must try again. Tinkering with the banking system will not be enough.</p> <p><strong>Roger Warren Evans</strong></p> <p>Barrister-at-Law (retired)</p> <p>Swansea</p> <p>With both government and private households up to their eyeballs in debt, it comes as no surprise that Will Hutton turns his attention to companies \u2013 the remaining and, for now, solvent sector of the economy. To remedy this problematic situation, Hutton envisages firms being required to have \"core purposes\" addressing \"wider economic and social benefits\" in the national interest. \"Footloose\" shareholders who might want to salvage their money before it is lost by companies caught up in this new state-inspired mercantilism will be given short shrift.</p> <p>The remaining investors will be invited to assign their votes to \"mutuals\", comprising no doubt the good and the great, who will bring appropriate pressure to bear on directors and managers \u2013 again in the wider national interest. To reinforce this responsible capitalism, bankers and trade unionists will be given seats on company boards to ensure that their particular expertise is applied in every company. In this way Hutton proposes to remedy the imbalance in the economy, rendering companies in the same state as the other two sectors.</p> <p><strong>John West</strong></p> <p>Salisbury</p> <p>Wiltshire</p> <p>Will Hutton's article is spot on. We seem to have ended up as the junkies of the western world where government and business leaders will do absolutely anything they can to get a short-term fix of their drug of choice \u2013 money.</p> <p>British companies and institutions? Sell 'em off quick as you can, just get the cash. Investment? Can't think about the future, need a fix now. And the City? A modern-day rookery run by thieves and fraudsters where anything goes. The people who run this country, both governmental and business, know the price of everything but the value of nothing. If the Olympics showed us one thing, it's that we as a nation have so much more to give the world. We should remake capitalism in our image, not the Conservative party's, for if we don't there'll only be one winner \u2013 them.</p> <p><strong>Marcus Respinger</strong></p> <p>London W3</p> <p>We have to agree with Will Hutton that our recent governments have not helped our industry. After the Thatcher government helped balance its budget by selling off many of our national assets, Gordon Brown finished the job by going round the world telling foreign investors to \"invest in Britain\". That sounds good until it is realised that he meant \"keep buying up our industries so that our import/export balance looks good\". The result is that our present government, which happens to be a coalition, is faced with the problems that Will Hutton exposed.</p> <p><strong>David Hunt</strong></p> <p>West Wickham</p> <p>Kent</p>",
  "<p>Christopher Marlowe's most quoted exchange comes in <em>The Jew of Malta</em> when Bernardine, a friar, tries to accuse the antihero Barabas of murder. \"Thou hast committed\u2026\" he begins. \"Fornication?\" interrupts Barabas as he deflects attention from a capital crime to a charge too footling for serious people to care about. \"But that was in another country, and besides, the wench is dead.\"</p> <p>Barabas's cool assertions that no one could prove a sex charge \u2013 \"but that was in another country\" \u2013 and no one need care \u2013 \"and besides, the wench is dead\" \u2013 have haunted writers and audiences for centuries. TS Eliot used them at the beginning of <em>Portrait of a Lady </em>to illustrate male indifference to female suffering. Colin Dexter and PD James wove them into their thrillers.</p> <p>I doubt if the words of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/oct/01/jimmy-savile-abuse-allegations-newsnight?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Peter Rippon, the editor of <em>Newsnight</em></a>, will ring down the ages. But they ought to be remembered for the Marlovian dismissiveness with which he explained why he had canned an investigation into Jimmy Savile. \"<em>Newsnight</em> is not normally interested in celebrity expos\u00e9,\" he said as he emphasised that he was a high-brow journalist rather than one of those grubby hacks Hugh Grant and Lord Justice Leveson so disapprove of. \"What was the public interest served by reporting it, given he is dead? The nature of the allegations and the level of proof required. The fact the incidents were 40 years ago.\"</p> <p>Rippon left it to others to allege that Savile had abused the young from the 1960s on BBC premises and charitable homes for abandoned children. He regrets what he said now, particularly as the BBC's management, who, if the allegations are correct, did nothing to stop Savile, appear to be thinking of making a sacrificial offering of his career. Nevertheless, the excuses given for keeping quiet are as important as the facts of a case. With child sex scandals, there is an unnerving consistency. The abuse happened a long time ago; no one can prove it; respectable people should not take the allegations seriously; no one need care.</p> <p>If I believed in a divinity, I would call the child abuse scandal that has destroyed the Roman Catholic church's reputation in Europe and North America divine justice. As I do not, I will stick to its repellent symmetries with the Savile affair. Abusive priests were once like celebrities. They were big figures in their parishes. They performed good works, as Savile did for charity. The children they groomed were rough boys and girls under the church's control. Who would want to believe their stories, even if the abused found the courage to tell them? When enough men and women found that courage, and the scandal could no longer be denied, the church switched from defending victimisers to playing the victim.</p> <p>\"From God comes the courage not to be intimidated by petty gossip,\" said Pope Benedict XVI, as he presented the accusations of the powerless as acts of aggression. In a moment beyond satire, the preacher to the Vatican household, one Father Raniero Cantalamessa, went further and compared criticism of the church's record on child abuse to \"the more shameful aspects of anti-semitism\". The powerful were now the persecuted. Their victims were the modern equivalent of the Nazis.</p> <p>It is a familiar inversion. When journalists hinted that \"Jimmy liked them young\", Savile replied that he did not like children at all \u2013 a revealing response in retrospect. He accounted for the gossip by saying that he was a famous man and a single man and his enemies made malicious assumptions on that basis. The celebrity, like the priest, was the true object of pity. His accusers were fantasists or worse.</p> <p>Irish atheist friends, who have learned from experience not to believe a word that emanates from the Catholic hierarchy, tell me that they smell a whiff of Protestant prejudice in British condemnations of Catholic backwardness. They are right to believe we have no grounds for feeling superior. The English judicial hierarchy has shown itself to be equally unconcerned with the abuse of children. In the case of Roman Polanski, the judiciary imitated the Pope and all his cardinals by staring evidence of child abuse in the face and then turning the other way. Polanski, you may remember, had fled to France to avoid punishment for having sex with a 13-year-old girl he had supplied with drink and drugs in LA.</p> <p>If you want to know why the British press only hinted at Savile's predilections, look at what happened when Polanski asked the English courts for permission to sue <em>Vanity Fair</em> for saying he had propositioned a woman while he was on the way to his wife's funeral. A terrible thing to say of a man of good reputation, no doubt, but how could a convicted child abuser living in exile to avoid a prison sentence be said to have a good reputation on matters sexual he could defend in court? The judges not only decided in 2005 that Polanski was a reputable man, paedophilia notwithstanding, they also worried that the Met would arrest him if he visited London. To save him from American justice, they allowed Polanski to give his evidence via video link from Paris.</p> <p>Chaps who look after other chaps make easy targets for a liberal newspaper. But let me move on from judges and clerics to the many versions of child abuse the politically correct protect. Peter Rippon proved that he wasn't a complete duffer when <em>Newsnight</em> aired a report in July on how thousands of British girls had Type III \"infibulation\" inflicted on them. Their mothers or grandmothers, or maybe an imam or some other variety of priest or \"traditional healer\", cut off the inner and outer labia and clitoris with scissors or a knife to form a wall of flesh and skin across the vulva, leaving only a hole the size of a matchstick.</p> <p>Not one representative from the teaching or medical professions would go on air to explain why they never protested. We live in a country where the law prohibiting genital mutilation has never been enforced; where the authorities go wild when a 15-year-old white girl runs off to France with her teacher but stay silent when Asian girls are yanked out of school and forced into marriage.</p> <p>The tolerance of child abuse by the old conservative establishment and their multicultural successors shows there is a strong public interest in learning how Jimmy Savile could abuse so many for so long \u2013 even though the wretch is dead.</p> <p>Comments will open later this morning</p>",
  "<p>Deep in the forest of Gribskov, some of the leaves are starting to flush with their autumnal colours. It makes the stand of blighted trees all the more obvious.</p> <p>Seven or eight 20m-high sticks, stripped of their greenery, are all that is left of a group of ash trees. \"It's very ugly and very sad,\" said Ditte Christina Olrik, a scientist with the Danish government's Nature Agency. \"The fungus is very, very small, like pinheads, on the leaf stalks. When the leaves die and fall, the wind carries them on to the next&#xa0;tree.\"</p> <p>The little killer that has affected almost all of Denmark's ash trees, and has stealthily destroyed ash in Germany, Poland, Norway, Sweden and Austria has a big name \u2013 <em>Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus</em>, an anamorph of <em>Chalara fraxinea</em>. For those who enjoy a walk in the woods without a Latin degree, it's ash dieback.</p> <p>The Danes, along with people in other European countries who have watched this fungus destroy their trees with a force not seen since the Dutch elm disease epidemic, have been urging Britain to ban imports of ash saplings to keep forests here quarantined.</p> <p>Last week the UK government launched a consultation that ends on 26 October and could lead to an interim import ban by November. But what the environment minister announced as \"timely\" action might in fact be far too late.</p> <p>In February, the fungus was found in a batch of trees sent from a Dutch nursery to Buckinghamshire. Between June and September it was confirmed in nurseries in Yorkshire, Surrey and Cambridgeshire, at a Forestry Commission Scotland woodland near Kilmacolm, and in ash trees planted in a Leicester car park. Conservationists hope it has not reached the 80 million ash trees in the wider British countryside, outside of new plantings.</p> <p>In Denmark 90% of their ash has been affected, their third most common tree species after oak and beech and a crucial export for the timber industry, and expect that to rise.</p> <p>In the state-owned forest in Zealand, north of Copenhagen, forest pathologist Iben Margrete Thomsen says their hope is that around 1% of ash in Denmark may prove resistant and survive.</p> <p>Passing a stand of balding trees, she points out one that still has a normal leaf cover \u2013 \"but, of course, we don't know if that is truly a resistant tree or one that will be affected very soon. In the end, though, only the few ash trees which are not susceptible to the fungus will be left.</p> <p>\"At first it was only the younger trees, and then we started to see it in the older trees too. Now I can see it everywhere. The fungus itself doesn't immediately kill the tree, but if you think of it acting a little like the HIV virus it weakens the immune system and allows some other disease to come in. It is the secondary disease that will finish the tree off.</p> <p>\"We have not seen anything on this scale since Dutch elm disease. Fungus is meant to kill trees, otherwise a tree would never die, but this escalation is something we have not seen. The UK and Ireland may well be, within the next 10 years, the only remaining places in Europe with ash. If they act.</p> <p>\"The rest of Europe wants the UK to act. They are saying 'get a ban' because they have seen what this disease can do. But whether or not it's too late?\" She shrugged. \"It may be a case of shutting the stable door when the horse has bolted. Time will tell.\"</p> <p>Outside of the forests, ash was used in towns and cities too, to replace many of the urban trees Denmark lost to Dutch elm disease.</p> <p>On Sonde Boulevard in the capital, Copenhagen, Lars Christensen is among a team of horticulturalists responsible for the city's landscaping. They, too, have seen ash dieback and here on this street have come up with their response: variation. Along the street that runs through a residential area are planted almost a dozen different species of young trees.</p> <p>\"It's about rethinking the two rows of identical trees in cities. It's simple, but surprisingly difficult to convince people that we cannot be reliant on one tree species, no matter how much people like them,\" he said.</p> <p>City trees have a tough time. Root restriction, pollution, salt and dog urine mean they have a life expectancy that is half that of a fellow forest tree. But constantly cutting down and replanting diseased trees is costly and last year Copenhagen brought in a 10% rule. \"Every tree we plant we have to check how many of that species is in an area already,\" explained Christensen, showing a great list of statistics for the city's areas. \"If, say, we already have 10% or more of ash then we have to plant lime or willow or whatever.\"</p> <p>But even if the city's busy residents will be protected from the sudden loss of their trees, the ash will be badly missed.</p> <p>In the national forest at Gribskov, Olrik points out an ash that has been cut down, how the beautiful light-coloured wood that makes ash so popular for furniture and other uses is discoloured and blotched.</p> <p>The tree trunk has an alien look, covered with unnatural-looking, thin green sprouts coming through the bark. \"The tree panics when the leaves die, so to try to stay alive, it pushes out lots of these things. It's one of the signs.</p> <p>\"Seventy years of growth and now good for firewood only,\" sighs Olrik. \"We cut this tree to show your UK Forestry Commission when they came here to have a look last week. They were very shocked.</p> <p>\"It's shocking. We are used to seeing ash dieback now, but it's still hard to think we are losing the ash tree. Not just economically, not just because it supports a unique and complex ecosystem that we will also lose, but it's such a traditional tree for Denmark; the tree of life it's called.</p> <p>\"You see many houses that will have a huge ash tree outside. It was supposed to protect the home from fire. Every Danish child knows a story about the ash tree, it is very important in mythology, and their death represents chaos.</p> <p>\"So now they are dying, some people are wondering, what does it mean? What is the future?\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Thursday 8 November. The headline and main text said that 90% of trees in Denmark had been killed. This is incorrect and has been changed to \"affected\". </p>",
  "<p>It was revealed at the <a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Leveson inquiry that</a> Jeremy Hunt, the then culture secretary, texted James Murdoch, sending his \"congrats\" after News Corp received approval from Brussels for its BSkyB takeover, now defunct. Hunt's career, far from being hindered by this lack of ministerial neutrality, has since flourished. He is now the health secretary, in charge of steering the ever-more complex reorganisation of the NHS into port while overseeing \u00a320bn in cuts. However, it is doubtful that Mr Hunt will be receiving any texted, honeyed endearments from his boss, David Cameron, as he prepares for the Conservative party conference that begins in Birmingham today.</p> <p>On Friday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/06/jeremy-hunt-12-week-abortion-limit\" title=\"\">Jeremy Hunt</a>, a committed Christian, announced that he backs a 12-week limit instead of the current 24-week limit for abortions. As a result, much to the annoyance of Cameron, at least the first two days of the conference will be spent discussing a draconian change to terminations, unlikely to become law; unsupported by all the health professional organisations, deeply unpopular with many women (when the coalition is already shedding female votes at an accelerating pace) and definitely not on the conference agenda. Much to Mr Cameron's chagrin, it is the \"I\" word that will undoubtedly once again come to the forefront of the minds of many of the electorate: I for incompetence.</p> <p>Concern about Mr Hunt's political judgment, however, has an impact far beyond the conference. He is in charge of health. Health offers all manner of ethical, as well as medical, dilemmas on birth, life and death. In every case, faith and morality will outflank reason and science. Ethics matter and no one should be condemned for their religious beliefs. But an insensitive health minister with apparently limited political intuition is liable to throw a series of hand grenades, destroying even the very best organised political strategies, let alone the increasingly shambolic one being pursued by the coalition.</p> <p>Comments will be turned on later this morning</p>",
  "<p>The explosion of smartphone titles such as <em>Flick Kick Football</em> and <em>New Star Soccer</em> have made football games more accessible than ever, opening the genre to audiences likely to balk at the convoluted menus and realistic gameplay of Fifa. But for the full football experience, it is the latter that remains the best title on offer, and this year's edition maintains the&nbsp;pedigree.</p> <p><em>Fifa 13</em> offers a big step forward over its predecessor, with player stats that now reflect their real-life counterparts, vastly improved dribbling, better team-mate AI, and commentary that includes touchline reports and score updates. There's also a new score-based challenge mode, Skill Games, which is almost as addictive as the aforementioned smartphone titles.</p> <p>But the biggest change involves ball control. Players can no longer expect near-perfect first touches, and poor passes to average players may result in loss of control. It can be frustrating, but it also adds unpredictability and excitement to the gameplay.</p> <p><em>Fifa 13</em>'s depth and realism make it a more difficult title to pick up and play than its handheld rivals, but given time even players who may initially find its complexity daunting will discover one of the finest sports titles ever made.</p>",
  "<p><em>Resident Evil 4</em> was seen by many as the high point for Capcom's lumbering horror franchise; the fifth instalment dipped. Now, number six lurches along, promising a return to form. Instead, it delivers a curious \"best of\", an assemblage of the series' most popular moments with a heavy focus on multiplayer.</p> <p>I found the constant push for co-op rather distracting, confusing even. Launch one of the three starter campaigns (one each for returning heroes Leon and Chris, and a third for newcomer Jake) and you're asked to choose between controlling the title characters or their partners. Then, in what for all purposes is a multiplayer lobby screen, you're nudged to invite someone to control the remaining figure. It takes a moment to realise that pressing the start button places the secondary characters under AI \u2013 not a terribly clear interface at all.</p> <p>But the real problem comes when you enter the game itself. Whatever pretensions of horror remain in <em>Resident Evil</em>'s spent cadaver are thoroughly eviscerated by the mere presence of a support character. You're not alone, ergo you're not afraid. Action replaces terror, most sections becoming brutal shootouts with strings of headshots.</p> <p>Barrelling through the three male leads' stories unlocks a fourth, that of femme fatale Ada Wong. Much closer to classic <em>Resi</em>, Ada's solo adventure more authentically captures the isolation and fear of earlier games, with some appropriately challenging puzzles. However, the 15 hours you'll need to devote before experiencing it may prove off-putting.</p> <p>There are high-points \u2013 the bioterrorism plot is as delightfully twisted as any before, and putting together the full narrative chronology through each campaign elevates it to something greater than the sum of its parts. Overall though, the piecemeal approach taken by <em>Resident Evil 6</em> makes it more of a Frankenstein's monster than a zombie opus worthy of Romero's \u2013 or even original creator Shinji Mikami's \u2013 legacy.</p>",
  "<p>The art shortlisted for the 2012 Turner prize is vivid, intelligent and original, with one dismal exception.

What is more, all of the shortlisted exhibitions took place in Britain and not in Oslo, Zurich or even Los Angeles so there is a good chance that all of the judges actually saw all of the shows, which cannot always have been the case.

It falls in three acts, each a wordplay on the title \u2013 quires of paper, the choir in church architecture, the singing choir \u2013 and unites them by syncopating old photographs, archive footage and newsreel to a rhythm of finger-clicks&#xa0;and hand-claps that will eventually burst into song with the Shangri-Las belting out their 60s hit <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFAV75uOk6Y\" title=\"\">Out in the Streets</a>.</p> <p>Price has hit on an exhilarating way of merging knowledge with image. She uses words which flick across the screen like terse bulletins, informative but impersonal.

Here she has deeper intentions. The work mounts towards its horrifying climax with a great respect for the dead, but then founders in the chaos, smoke and grief, uncertain how to end. It succeeds as an act of commemoration \u2013 once seen, the Woolworths tragedy will never been forgotten \u2013 if not quite as a work of art.</p> <p><strong>Luke Fowler</strong>'s film about RD Laing and the anti-psychiatry movement is, by contrast, long, slow, diffuse and elusive.

It begins with the charismatic author of<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Divided-Self-Existential-Psychology/dp/0140135375\" title=\"\"> <em>The Divided Self </em></a>expounding his beliefs and travels, all the way to the Laing who released pop records and could still galvanise a television audience when drunk, in the notorious RTE interview with Gay Byrne.</p> <p>But even to describe the film this way is misleading. For it does not proceed by narrative so much as digression, detail, sudden glimpse and&#xa0;brief dialogue. It is a mass of short scenes and snapshots of the inner workings of medical institutions spliced with footage of the vast life going on outside, as if the world were crowding into the film rather as it crowds into the minds of the people on&#xa0;screen.</p> <p>People who may or may not be ill: the definition of insanity in the 60s appears shockingly broad; indeed, people who may or may not be psychiatrists themselves. Tense, chain-smoking, garrulous: patients and practitioners, orthodox and unorthodox, can seem so&#xa0;alike.</p> <p>This is not glib. Even as one begins to perceive Laing in a new light \u2013 Fowler isolates moments of compassion, sadness, uncertainty, even fear in his self-aggrandising subject \u2013 <em>All Divided Selves </em>also shows the consequences of his doctrines. This is not just the bewilderment and squalor of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/02/rd-laing-mental-health-sanity\" title=\"\">Kingsley Hall experiment</a>, but the long-term effects of releasing mentally ill patients to sleep rough and suffer in the community.</p> <p>Fowler keeps it all in play to the point where one wonders whether the film is dialectical at all, whether it is questioning either Laing or his opponents. Is he the consummate media star or the oppressive figure always present in the background at Kingsley Hall; is he a figure of freedom&#xa0;or not?</p> <p>It feels as if the film is a parallel experiment, being freeform and unauthored \u2013 no rules, no limits, as if there was nobody in charge. But its structure is a measure of its meaning. It builds through all sorts of nuances towards some piercingly sad scenes of hospitalised patients, dosed to stupefaction, whose difficulties are visibly more than mental \u2013 poverty, violence, accident, the world crowding&#xa0;in. Their doctors ignore all this in favour of drugs; Laing would have \"freed\" them.</p> <p><strong>Spartacus Chetwynd</strong>'s carnivalesque performances involve awkward people, botched backdrops and hopeless puppets. The curators describe them as \"deliberately amateurish\", but how can they tell? Nothing in the gyrations of four blokes in painted sheets and smeary camouflage lugging a papier-mache rabbit \u2013 reference Beuys's hare \u2013 presenting us with a \"shaman\" suggested that anything could ever have been any better.</p> <p>Chetwynd must have a following otherwise she would not be here. But the aesthetic is so wilfully cack-handed, the thinking so coarse \u2013 bit of Rabelais, bit of Bosch and Beuys, bit of a laugh \u2013 that silence is the only polite response.</p> <p>There is a huge distance between the best and the worst work this year. But consider a fine remark from Penelope Curtis, chair of the judges. \"We would find it easier to leave the shortlist as it stands now, the result of many different&#xa0;kinds of work by different kinds of people.\" How right she is, given that it only represents the different values of a handful of judges as well. Why not forget the old rules at last and split the Turner prize, democratically, four ways?</p>",
  "<p>Indhu Rubasingham arrives early at the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/tricycle-theatre\" title=\"\">Tricycle theatre</a> in Kilburn, north London \u2013 and that's as it should be because she runs it. Rubasingham has been its artistic director for three months since taking over from Nicolas Kent, who ran the theatre for 28 years. She's a welcoming, warm and wonderfully open person. She admits Kent is a daunting act to follow and yet enthuses about her new home \u2013 its exotic paint colours, its renovated bar. But we are not, as she knows, here to inspect the bar. We're here to meet Adrian Lester and his wife, Lolita Chakrabarti, and to talk about <a href=\"http://www.tricycle.co.uk/current-programme-pages/theatre/theatre-programme-main/red-velvet/\" title=\"\"><em>Red Velvet</em></a>, the play launching Rubasingham's first season. Lester is to star, and Chakrabarti wrote it. It could not be a more enticing prospect. And now here they are, pushing open the door to the Tricycle's upstairs interview room \u2013 tall, late and damp from the morning's rain. He cuts a dash and so does she (Lolita is both a writer and an actress \u2013 she first made her name as Jamila Blake in <em>The Bill</em>). Lester is dressed in black from head to toe \u2013 they're smiling, approachable and look slightly beset like the parents they are.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2001/jul/22/features.review27\" title=\"\">The last time I met Lester</a> was in 2001 when he was in his 30s and playing Hamlet in Peter Brook's production. I remember he talked almost as much then about his four-and-a-half-month-old baby daughter, Lila, as about the prince of Denmark. He was worried about not being home more (<em>Hamlet</em> and nappy-changing did not mix), and he said, with a laugh, that he was lucky to have \"an understanding wife\". Great to meet that understanding wife today, temporarily unshackled from domesticity \u2013 their daughters are now 11 and eight \u2013 and to be able to congratulate her on what is a tremendously accomplished play.</p> <p>In theory I'm interviewing three people but we would not be here without a fourth \u2013 the 19th-century African American Ira Aldridge, one of the greatest Shakespearean actors of his day and the play's subject. There's a festive atmosphere up here in the Tricycle's attic (one feels sure Rubasingham would throw a good party and that the same talent must inform her directing). And in our light-hearted way we all wish the interview could turn seance and Aldridge join us. Whatever would he be like? How would his acting strike us? \"Would his acting work?\" Chakrabarti wonders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397165167\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/10/4/1349347936544/Ira-Aldridge-painting-001.jpg\" alt=\"Ira Aldridge painting\" width=\"200\" height=\"239\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ira Aldridge as Othello, by James Northcote (1826). Photograph: Manchester Art Galleries</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manchester Art Galleries</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We know what Aldridge looked like from <a href=\"http://www.manchestergalleries.org/the-collections/about-the-collection-2/history-of-the-collection/\" title=\"\">James Northcote's 1826 portrait</a> in Manchester Art Gallery. A creamy chemise and white lace kerchief perfectly sets off his dark skin. He has finely curved eyebrows, a sensual mouth, a distinguished nose. His countenance looks as if to be alert was habitual \u2013 the sideways glance watchful. But then he was playing Othello \u2013 a stormy sky behind him. In publicity shots, Lester looks satisfactorily similar with wary eyes and white necktie. And as one of our most talented Shakespearean actors he's the man for the part (even if his career includes roles Aldridge never got a stab at \u2013 Rosalind in Cheek by Jowl's celebrated all-male <em>As You Like It</em> and non-Shakespearean triumphs such as confidence trickster Mickey Bricks in the BBC's <em>Hustle</em>).</p> <p>Rubasingham explains how the play came about: \"I directed Lolita 12 years ago at the National and we became friends. She told me she was doing a screenplay about Ira Aldridge, and I was shocked because I'd done&nbsp;a drama degree but had never heard of him. She told me, with passion, that&nbsp;we should know his story. I said, 'Don't make it a screenplay: write a play.'\"</p> <p>It's a play that \"works on many levels, which is why I wanted it as my opening at the Tricycle. It's partly about politics in theatre and what we need to do to make theatre relevant. It's about how, in spite of obstacles, talent shines through. This man \u2013 in a period when slavery still existed in America and we were debating here whether to get rid of slavery in the colonies \u2013 was on the Covent Garden stage in one of only two theatres to have a royal patent.\"</p> <p>She adds that Aldridge, who was born in New York in 1807, became the highest-paid actor in Russia. When he died on tour in Poland in 1867 he was given a state funeral. \"He's a role model,\" says Rubasingham. \"I hope young people will see the play and go, 'Wow, if he can do it\u2026 ' For we are all full of self-doubt about whether we belong: are we inside or outside?\" And she implies that she's going to need Aldridge's example as she takes on the Tricycle (coping with its \u00a3350,000 subsidy cut, for starters).</p> <p>She is a woman on a mission, believing in drawing in \"people who don't go to the theatre \u2013 it must not become a rarefied art form or we will lose the reason taxpayers fund it\". For the first time in the Tricycle's history, there is to be a Christmas show, <em>One Monkey Don't Stop No Show</em>, a reworking of the Arabian Nights. But she is not playing safe: her season also includes <em>Paper Dolls</em>, a play that resists paraphrase about five immigrant workers caring for Hasidic Jews (the carers perform cross-dressing cabaret in their spare time). Rubasingham talks with particular zest about the Tricycle's multicultural neighbourhood and her desire to \"make the world a smaller place\" through theatre. A goal you could say she shared with Aldridge.</p> <p>Chakrabarti first heard of Aldridge at a reading of Lester's in 1998 and was determined to find out more: \"I didn't know where to start \u2013 there was no internet then \u2013 but he drew me on.\" Her play is more than a portrait; it's an exploration of acting, an <em>Othello</em> masterclass. And for Lester this is fortuitous as he has been cast as Othello in Nicholas Hytner's production at the National next year. \"It's a brilliant way in,\" he says. He describes Aldridge as \"a one-man case for the abolition movement\" \u2013 as well as being a pioneer for black actors.</p> <p>In a recent newspaper interview, Rubasingham, with characteristic humour, reversed a question \u2013 about being a female, Asian&nbsp;director \u2013 to inquire as to how being white and male might be affecting the journalism of her interrogator. One can understand that there might be a limit, as she laughingly suggests, to how often she wants to be asked about her Sri Lankan parents. And yet, I put it to&nbsp;all of them, is there not a danger that treating race as a non-issue tilts the subject too far towards a homogeneity in which roots, history, individual differences mean nothing? Here we have a play about an extraordinary figure \u2013 the first to prove that being black was no bar to classical acting. Is it fair to his memory to persist in saying there is nothing to discuss?</p> <p>It's a tussle to which we are about to return. But before we do, I want to add that I was startled and amused by the play's take on journalism. When a Polish female journalist breaks into Aldridge's dressing room, he turns on her: \"You exist because I do. Without me you'd be even less than you already are.\" And so I ask the trio to name their pet-hate questions from journalists &nbsp;\u2013 the worst they have ever been asked. And the conversation takes off:</p> <p><strong>IR:</strong> My worst is: \"How does being Asian inform your directing?\" And I'll tell you why: because that is what we always get labelled with. Every interview I have ever done. I don't know what the answer is. But I came up with a good response; said because I was born in this country, I knew what it was like to straddle two cultures, and as a director the ability to be inside and outside is good. Headline: \"Culturally confused Indhu Rubasingham.\" I am not culturally confused! Journalists need to find their story but that's too easy.</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> And mine is: \"What is it like being a black actor?\" Ira had all his acting talent; his supreme skill, reduced to the colour of his skin. It bores me to death to sit in front of interviewers and have four or five questions on, say, Peter Brook and <em>Hamlet</em> and then: \"So\u2026 what is it like being black?\" I think: do you need to sell the piece this way? Why? Why not take the fact I was born on a council estate, had no contact with Shakespeare, did not go to university, got into Rada, left there at a young age\u2026 Yet the most interesting thing is: you're brown. That is a reduction.</p> <p><strong>LC: </strong>My pet-hate question is: \"What is it like being married to Adrian Lester?\" [Everyone laughs.] No, but that reduces me entirely. And it's not just journalists. People come up to me in the street and I get told: \"Oooh, you're so lucky being married to Adrian Lester.\"</p> <p><strong>KK:</strong> I'll have to cross that question off my list then\u2026 But in your play you have the line: \"I don't know how actors manage children. A lot of them do it \u2013 often, though, the parents are even more demanding than their offspring.\" How is your work/life balance?</p> <p><strong>LC:</strong> I wrote those lines and laughed my head off. This is a mad career to have children in \u2013 unstable, unpredictable.</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> At least no more nappies now\u2026 Yet working together has strained us, because normally when Lolita is working I catch the weight of what's going on at home. But if we're both on call it's trickier. We couldn't have done this when the children were younger.</p> <p><strong>LC:</strong> Our eldest has just started secondary school so is going through her own change. It's pretty full-on. You couldn't sustain it but for short bursts like this.</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> We don't have a rule about talking about work at home but sometimes we say: let's stop now, close the door, check on the kids, watch something light.</p> <p><strong>IRLC:</strong> If I'm worried about a line, I'll be worrying from a structure point of view. I don't tell Adrian as he will worry from an acting point of view.</p> <p><strong>KK:</strong> Do we know what Ira Aldridge's acting style was like? Are you trying to play him in a dated way?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> The style then was to be beautiful. It was all gesture: you retained an elegance even in the most painful moments. Indhu wants us to take on a style relevant to a modern audience, but at the same time be stylistically true to what would have been created then. So it's really, really easy!</p> <p><strong>KK: </strong>The scene in which Charles Kean, son of the legendary actor Edmund Kean, is being racist is particularly brilliant but excruciating\u2026</p> <p><strong>LC:</strong> I didn't think of it as writing about racism. I thought of different people in a room. I thought of Ira, the only black Shakespearean of the time, entering this hallowed hall: what would that be like?</p> <p><strong>AL: </strong>When intelligent people have racist thoughts they intellectualise feelings. The basis may be: you are different, I don't like you, and you're taking something which should be mine \u2013 but they add an intellectual spin. It becomes an argument about theatre and art.</p> <p><strong>KK:</strong> Ira's courage was extraordinary \u2013 to withstand such prejudice. What takes courage in your lives?</p> <p><strong>AL: </strong><em>As You Like It</em>, the first night \u2013 fear and worry. I had to have the courage to let go and do it honestly, but this is tiny compared to what Ira did\u2026</p> <p><strong>LC:</strong> I don't want to get complacent so I constantly challenge. I write, act and have started producing. It sounds far too much. But I'm going to write a film\u2026 You need courage to keep pushing.</p> <p><strong>IR:</strong> This job as artistic director has already tested my mettle and forced me to take a deep breath\u2026</p> <p>And this sounds like a cue for us to part company. Extraordinarily, later on the same day that we meet there is news that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/sep/26/painting-ira-aldridge-garage\" title=\"\">a rare unsigned 1820s painting of Ira Aldridge</a>, wearing piratical scarlet (in an as yet unidentifiable play) has turned up in a Birmingham garage. The other actors in the painting look feeble, white and flabbergasted. The man's spirit is surfacing. Rubasingham, Lester and Chakrabarti had better not hang around. They have only days now in which to bring Aldridge back on&nbsp;stage.</p>",
  "<p>Walter Salles first picked up a copy of <em>On the Road</em> as a student in Brazil in the 1970s. The country was under a military dictatorship at the time, torture and censorship were rife, and the dog-eared book was passed furtively from hand to hand, a window to a kind of freedom he and his fellow students could only dream about. It affected him profoundly: \"The way they lived was the way in which we wanted to live, so the book had a very resonant quality for my generation. The idea of movement as an instrument to better understand who you are and who you could eventually be wasn't allowed to us because the roads were blocked. Literally. We were denied a future and here were characters fighting to redefine their own future.\"</p> <p>So when Francis Ford Coppola asked him to direct the movie of <em>On the Road</em> in 2004 \u2013 after seeing Salles's <a href=\"http://film.theguardian.com/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0,,1291408,00.html\" title=\"\"><em>The</em> <em>Motorcycle Diaries</em></a> at the Sundance film festival \u2013 it was a responsibility he took seriously. Not only was the book a cult classic of American literature, but the preceding 50 years were littered with the wrecks of failed attempts to turn it into a film. Jack Kerouac first mooted the idea of an adaptation in 1957 when he wrote to Marlon Brando suggesting that he could play Dean Moriarty (Kerouac would play Sal Paradise). Brando never replied. In 1979, Coppola bought the film rights and there followed several doomed attempts involving heavyweight directors such as Gus Van Sant and Jean-Luc Godard and an ever\u2011changing lineup of leading men, from Brad Pitt to Sean Penn.</p> <p>A documentary-maker by background, Salles agreed to take on the film on the condition that he could first make a non-fiction account of his \"search for <em>On the Road</em>\". There followed an intense five-year research period, with Salles crisscrossing America in search of every last surviving beat writer, artist and expert, meeting the surviving characters who inspired the fictional alter egos and faithfully retracing the route taken by Kerouac and his band of adventurers \"in search of <em>it</em>\".</p> <p>It was on one of these research trips, to Kerouac's childhood home in Lowell, Massachusetts, that Salles was shown \"the scroll\" \u2013 the 120ft-long roll of paper on which the author had famously typed the original stream-of-consciousness manuscript in 1951. This proved to be a turning point for Salles and provided the answer to the question: how do you film the&#xa0;unfilmable?</p> <p>A far more visceral piece of writing than the heavily edited version that was eventually published by Penguin in 1957, the scroll opens with the death of Sal's father and, for Salles, this represented the key to the film's thematic core: \"The search for the father leitmotif was so much more present in this version than in the 1957 edition, that we immediately altered the beginning of the screenplay and Jose Rivera, our writer, started to use the scroll as the text he was adapting,\" Salles explains.</p> <p>Realising that it would be futile to make the book adhere to the traditional Hollywood three-act format, Salles and Rivera decided to remain true to the book's collection of disjointed journeys rather than trying to condense it neatly into one epic trip. Instead, they took their narrative arc from the developing friendship between Dean and Sal, and their transition from youth into&#xa0;adulthood.</p> <p>During his travels, it became apparent to Salles that the diversity of landscapes the characters travel through in the book no longer existed in 21st-century America: \"You can drive 2,000 miles and you will encounter the same Walmarts, fast-food chains and homogenised architecture that you saw two days before.\" The search for authenticity took them 60,000 miles in total, from Argentina to Canada, chasing the snows of Patagonia and the blistering heat of Mexico.</p> <p>True to the spirit of the book, where living vicariously is not an option, Salles wanted his cast to feel the changing seasons, \"to experience the rain on the windshield, the dust, to feel the humidity of Louisiana, or when you are in the midst of the Arizona desert, to feel the solitude\". This commitment to experiencing everything first-hand led the director and Garrett Hedlund, who plays Dean Moriarty, to take their own road trip once the main shoot had finished, to capture some of the book's spontaneity and a sense of the changing landscapes.</p> <p>\"We took the old Hudson and did the journey from the east coast to the west. Garrett was driving and whenever we saw a back road that looked interesting we took it,\" says Salles. \"It was conceived with the same kind of freedom that you find in the book and we didn't know where we were going to sleep. We got to meet really extraordinary characters on the way\u2026 we were listening to jazz all the time\u2026 it was a unique journey.\" Much of the footage captured on this trip made it into the final cut of the film.</p> <p>A similarly rigorous approach was taken when it came to preparing the cast for their roles. Salles gathered them together in Montreal for a \"beatnik bootcamp\" \u2013 a month-long immersion and bonding session with visits and talks from beat survivors and experts. They were preaching to the converted. For most of the actors and crew this was a passion project, inspired by a love of the book. Kristen Stewart, for example, first read <em>On the Road</em> aged 14 and was intrigued by the Marylou character, the child-bride who rejects the traditional roles on offer for women of that era and goes on the road with Dean and Sal, blazing a trail for sexual liberation. She was one of the first actors to be cast, back in 2007 before the <em>Twilight</em> phenomenon, and her sudden rise to fame was instrumental in helping the project to finally secure its elusive financing.</p> <p>Hedlund was similarly committed to the cause, turning down other parts during the long and tortuous development period so that he could be available for the part of Dean Moriarty when the film finally got the green light. Producer Rebecca Yeldham, who had previously worked with Salles on <em>The</em> <em>Motorcycle Diaries</em>, explains that they were well aware that Kerouac fans would be coming&#xa0;to the film with their own expectations about how the characters of Dean and Sal should look and act, and did not want to add another layer of expectation to that by casting an established actor.</p> <p>\"We wanted the audience to discover Sal and Dean through a fresh lens,\" she says. \"So even though we had many name actors jostling for those two parts, Walter really loved the idea of discovering two actors for those roles. In the UK, Sam Riley [who plays Sal] is better known than he is in other parts of the world, but he's still fresh, he doesn't bring expectations. Garrett had been in a range of movies but was still relatively unknown. Walter met Garrett in 2007 and the minute Garrett walked into the room and began to read\u2026 Walter didn't want to make the movie with anyone else.\"</p> <p>Kerouac's book is famously influenced by the free-flow style and energy of the jazz scene that was burgeoning in the clubs of Harlem in the late 1940s. Salles tried to inject a little of that spirit into the shoot by encouraging his cast to improvise where possible: \"The actors were so immersed in that world that at some point they started to be able to improvise in the logic of their characters. It's a little bit like jazz. Once you know the structure of the piece you are allowed to bifurcate from it because you know you will find your way back,\" he says. Some of the movie's more memorable scenes \u2013 notably where a hitchhiker (played by musician Jake La Botz) starts to sing an a cappella song in the back of the car, and during an unsettling stopover at the Louisiana home of junkie William Burroughs (a memorable cameo by Viggo Mortensen) \u2013 were the result of such&#xa0;improvisation.</p> <p>Salles admits that there were times during the film's protracted genesis when he doubted that it would ever get made. But for him, the journey was worthwhile. This is his fourth road-trip movie and comparisons will inevitably be drawn with <em>The Motorcycle Diaries</em>, a similar tale of friendship between two men on a journey of discovery.</p> <p>\"The narrative is very similar to <em>Motorcycle Diaries</em> in the sense that it is constructed layer by layer and [gradually] you reach a point where you realise that the characters are not the same ones you've been following since the beginning of the journey. The journey is very complex because it entails moments of exhilaration but also moments of extraordinary pain. Loss is included in the idea of movement.\"</p> <p>A complex and rewarding genre the road-trip movie may be, but Salles admits he wouldn't mind tackling something less epic and more contained for his next project: \"My next film is going to be set in a phone booth.\"</p>",
  "<p>Joseph Connolly specialises in sardonic period melodramas whose characters he either harshly cherishes or affectionately despises \u2013 it's hard to resolve the nuance, which is part of the sour fun of reading him. <em>England's Lane</em> portrays the lives and loves of assorted people living in the un-smart Hampstead street of the same name at the tail end of the 1950s. There's Milly, estranged from her insensitive ironmonger husband and saving all her love for her orphaned nephew Paul, almost 11, who lives with them. There's Stan the sweetshop owner, whose wife Janey has either become catatonic after their son contracted polio or is putting on an act. And there's Jonathan the butcher, cultivated and charismatic in the three-piece suits he wears even at work, clearly not born to his trade, whose remark that blood has no smell isn't exactly reassuring.</p> <p>1950s detail is evoked in all its oppressiveness, with the occasional half-wink to the reader signalling shifts in perception. \"Nigger brown\" is still a colour of fabric. Smoking in pregnancy isn't seen as dangerous and nor is X-raying your feet in the shoeshop (assistants do it for a lark). Chicken is a luxury. Stan thinks a new chocolate mint has no chance of establishing itself unless it drops the silly name of After Eight. The characters' illusions about themselves are partly exposed by their choice of words, whether it's Milly bringing \"a selection of sandwiches\" to an erotic rendezvous or Jonathan describing himself as \"replete\" after a meal and his wife as \"over-refreshed\" when she's plain drunk.</p> <p>Connolly has a very individual way with point of view. There are two main ways of handling multiple points of view in a novel, corresponding to the two main traditions of puppetry. The operator is either hidden, as in a Punch and Judy show, or in plain sight, as in the Japanese <em>bunraku</em>. A powerful effect can be achieved by either method \u2013 but the glimpse of a hairy wrist protruding above the striped frontage of a booth at the seaside kills the illusion of Mr Punch. Something of the sort happens when a background third person makes itself felt a little too much: \"Stanley Miller the sweetshop owner was not looking forward to today \u2013 no sir I am not, he would easily confide in you\u2026\", for instance, or \"\u2026here is how Fiona Barton would idly be talking, how she would languidly confide in you\u2026\". In fact, Fiona has her husband's secrets to protect, and doesn't confide in anyone. Moments like these betray the lurking presence of a narrator, even if his role is pure stage management and he never develops any particular characteristics.\"</p> <p><em>England's Lane</em> is far from being an experimental novel but it borrows several cups of sugar from that grand house of literary experiment, <em>Ulysses</em>. Its tone has a sort of soaring fussiness of diction: \"This is the thought that was idling contentedly in Milly's happy mind as she girlishly was swinging to and fro a shopping basket in time with her purposeful steps, squinting up at the sun that alternately filtered softly, then suddenly was sparkling silver through the overhanging lattice of thin and quivering quite black branches, so very high above her.\" And this is Jonathan: \"The defiant and aristocratic curvature of a proudly prominent nose was dapplingly encrimsoned by crazed and hectic lattices of detonated veins.\" Something about the word \"lattice\" seems to trigger particular excess.</p> <p>All the principal monologues, in fact, have a disagreeable texture. Jonathan's mind is like a fierce old tweed that has become greasy with wear but still chafes the skin, and Milly snags the reader's toenails like a nylon bedsheet. If you don't enjoy having your teeth set on edge then perhaps this isn't the book for you. It's difficult to combine the use of interior monologue with the advancement of a plot, a problem which Joyce solved by relegating plot to the far background. Here the stream of consciousness only seems to meander, and is actually pulled along by a purposeful undertow towards the weir of the next incident or confrontation.</p> <p>Jonathan is the wild card in the book's consciously ill-assorted deck of caricatures. He seems to be an intruder from a more lurid genre. By the time he has asked Fiona to knit him a thick black balaclava, and she has obliged in short order with an item in triple-ply cashmere, it's clear that we're approaching the domain of parody. Joseph Connolly delights in highlighting his story's unreality, even while he works to maintain its levels of entertainment and surprise (this is not a novelist who traffics in the obvious outcomes).</p> <p>His strangest decision is not only to make Jonathan and Milly's styles overlap (the word \"umbrous\" an obvious giveaway) but to have other characters remark on it. For good measure he takes one of Stanley's refrains, the phrase \"sort of style\", and gives it to Jim for the second half of the book. The adverbial excess given to Fiona as a defining mannerism (\"generally usual\", \"wholly probably unspeakable\") gradually spreads to other characters.</p> <p>There are moments when <em>England's Lane</em> poses as a national portrait: \"it is not just England's Lane that begins to stir,\" as the last page tells us, with the 1960s under way, \"it is England's every lane and borough.\" Easy to discount this ersatz ambition, easy too to resist the bogus hints of deeper meaning \u2013 the Austrian refugees, for instance, who discover that if they put their real name, Schmidt, on the sign above their delicatessen, they will encounter boycotting, violence, the smashing of windows. Everything they thought to escape. That's all very well, but it's the author who has set the parochial limits, and only now gestures with conscious humbug towards a wider world.</p> <p>It's the same with the two West Indian characters \u2013 glib to condemn the reflex racism of the past while sticking with your own rudimentary characterisation, one man witlessly benign, the other full of cruel rage, and not taking the risk of venturing into either head. Connolly must be forgiven these teases. He knows exactly what he's doing, in an immensely contrived, sophisticated and satisfying game.</p>",
  "<p>In 2007 Prince played a 21-night stand at the O2 in London. The author of this book went to 19 of the shows and \"deeply regretted missing the two I couldn't attend\". The inscrutable pop legend also delivered full-band sets at 14 of the after-show parties, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/27/20-best-prince-songs-never-heard\" title=\"\">Matt Thorne</a> saw all but one of those, too.</p> <p>You wonder if it's possible to care any more deeply about a musician until the moment he's ushered into Prince's Los Angeles living room for an exclusive album launch performance. The publicist from Universal whispers, \"I'd rather piss down my leg than miss a second of this\", and Thorne takes a surreptitious step away from her.</p> <p>Obviously you need a lot of belief to justify hammering out this length and level of scrutiny, but too much affection tends to fog the vision. You can lose sight of the key details that might engage someone outside the subject's central orbit. Someone like me, in fact: I saw the head-spinning spectacle of the Purple Rain and Sign O' the Times tours and felt weak with admiration, yet I've never felt any compulsion to read a book about Prince. He seems easy to applaud but hard to love, a dazzling technical wizard offering no real chance to connect with him.</p> <p>The first half of this chronicle is highly engaging, a mass of background colour that maps out his evolution. When his parents split he's brought up by his jazz musician father, and it's the sight of John \"Prince Rogers\" Nelson on stage surrounded by attractive women that spurs his son into a career plan. Prince Nelson Junior is manically driven, promoting himself as a sort of \"Stevie Wunderkind\" prodigy. \"A tiny little person with huge hair\", he turns up backstage aged 16 at a Todd Rundgren show announcing, \"I'm real talented and I play everything.\" Joni Mitchell remembers him in her audience a year later \u2013 \"quite conspicuous because he's got those eyes like a puffin, those Egyptian eyes, those big exotic eyes\".</p> <p>His drive and creativity are a marvel to behold. He holds competitions to see who can write the most songs in a day. He hires a 60-piece orchestra only to mothball the recordings in his famous vault where \"hundreds\" of songs apparently await release. He collaborates with a bizarre variety of people, from Sheena Easton to Kate Bush and Miles Daviscorrect (and let the record reflect that he wrote A Couple of Miles for Davis, who returned the favour with Half Nelson), and any psychologist could find a formative link between his lack of a mother figure and the succession of band members he adopts as either muse, lover or both \u2013 Vanity, Jill Jones, Cat Glover, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Melvoin\" title=\"\">Wendy Melvoin</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Coleman_(musician)\" title=\"\">Lisa Coleman</a> among them.</p> <p>Thorne painstakingly tracks down many of these fellow travellers, though he can't prise a great deal out of them. With the subject himself unavailable to shed any first-hand light, the game begins to drift slightly from the half-time whistle, and we're offered greats slabs of live concert review to sustain our attention. Past his commercial peak, the Prince that now channels his energy into self-mythology and highly publicised spats over his \"enslavement\" by Warner Brothers is nowhere near as beguiling as the mythical creature bursting out of Minneapolis into a brave new world of supercharged funk-blues and rock theatre. Who gives a monkey's that \"he kills off seven alternative Princes\" in the straight-to-video movie <em>3 Chains o' Gold</em> to symbolise his rebirth outside the manacles of a cruel and acquisitive major-label system? Even Thorne concedes that, while his hero made many of the old guard look hopelessly unfashionable in the 1980s, he himself seemed \"out of synch\" a decade later. One '92 outtake called Poor Little Bastard, he rather sweetly admits, is so godawful that he plays it whenever he feels his passion for the back catalogue needs a brake pedal.</p> <p>This second act is slow going and could do with some deeper musical analysis. We're told Prince \"hates the Beatles\" and had \"little first-hand knowledge of jazz\" or that a song has \"an overly complicated arrangement\", but you yearn for some real insight into the great cauldron of influence that produced a musician so effortlessly skilled that his sets ricochet from the B-52s' Rock Lobster one minute to Wayne Shorter's Footprints the next. Thorne makes the valid point, though, that the trajectory of his career \u2013 spanning all the shifting tectonic plates of the old music business model to survive on his own terms \u2013 could never be repeated.</p> <p>You get to understand Prince as a cold and calculating operator but you never feel close to the beating heart of a human being. Perhaps the latter is impossible, partly because he remains so closely guarded and partly, I suspect, because beneath this sparkling empire lurks a man with very little warmth indeed.</p>",
  "<p>David Thomson is a metaphysician of the movies \u2013 a unique guide to what happens when, like Plato's cave-dwellers, we cluster in the dark to gaze at a light that is refracted, second-hand, the shadow of dancing bodies and dreamily beautiful faces that once burned an impression of themselves on&#xa0;to film. Plato's cavemen looked into an illusory fire, with the sun behind them; we watch brightness&#xa0;projected on to a screen, whose purpose is to conceal reality not&#xa0;reveal it. Are we huddled there in the hope of&#xa0;enlightenment or do we have a devious need for the darkness, which gives us licence to dream with our eyes open and to fantasise about the mayhem and murder acted out for our enjoyment?</p> <p>In 1967 Thomson's first book, <em>Movie Man</em>, examined the strangeness of what had become \"a visual society\" and worried about the ethics of \"a visible society\", ruled by snooping cameras. After a dozen or more collections of essays, semi-fictional rhapsodies addressed to Warren Beatty and Nicole Kidman, and that opinionated encyclopedia of opinions <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/film/9781408701591/the-new-biographical-dictionary-of-film\" title=\"\"><em>A Biographical Dictionary of the Cinema</em></a>, he returns now to the subject that has preoccupied him all along: how did movies alter the collective consciousness?</p> <p><em>Movie Man</em> had a McLuhanesque enthusiasm for the electronic future, but fretted, in its account of the book-burning in Truffaut's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cQ-yGCyjyM\" title=\"\"><em>Fahrenheit 451</em></a>, about the possible loss of an older wisdom. That revolution has happened, and Thomson today is a septuagenarian movie man who laments the end of cinema. In an affluent society, we're so mobile we don't need movies: car windows are \"screens that give us a travelling show\". But the young don't look out of those windows; they are fixated on screens the size of their palms, which open on to a Facebook page where, in a parody of what the movies once did, desire is converted \"into a fee payment and a surrender to ads\". Thomson sees these kids as the offspring of Godard's jittery methodology. Jump-cutting happens inside their heads; their minds are remote control devices, enabling them to fast-forward through life.</p> <p>Films are a kind of religion for Thomson, and <em>The Big Screen</em> is forever hailing the holy light that irradiates his screens. \"The light,\" he says of California, \"is like a gift\"; American life, like the movies, promises every citizen a place in the sun. Thomson attributes the fragile lyricism of Ingmar Bergman's early films to the brevity of the Swedish summer, and says that Leni Riefenstahl in her documentation of the Berlin Olympics photographed \"mountain light at ground level\". Film is flickery, so kinetic that it disappears in motion, like an aeroplane propeller. But the intensity of Thomson's love makes it solidify before our eyes: the black and white nightclubs where Fred and Ginger dance feel, he says, \"like hardened cellophane, or film stock\".</p> <p>The light can be malevolent. Think of Raymond Burr's glinting cigarette in the otherwise dark apartment \u2013 a den of iniquity like a cinema \u2013 in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36204/rear-window\" title=\"\"><em>Rear Window</em></a>. One of the many bravura riffs in Thomson's book concerns cinematic smoking: have movies lost a certain intensity now that actors are not permitted, like Bogey and Bacall lighting up to flirt in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/34621/big-sleep\" title=\"\"><em>The Big Sleep</em></a>, to suck on fire? Light that once dazzled became lethal when Antonioni, after photographing a news headline about the perils of the atomic age, chose to finish <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7J78UeM9xk\" title=\"\"><em>L'eclisse</em></a> with the sudden ignition&#xa0;of a street lamp on a deserted urban corner.</p> <p>Thomson has never denied that cinema is voyeurism, and says here that \"the sheen in Murnau's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFJtblnLX1s\" title=\"\"><em>Sunrise</em> </a>is the glow of desirability\". He stands up for equal-opportunity exposure, and after noting the first appearance of female pubic hair in Antonioni's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Xz1utzILj4\" title=\"\"><em>Blow-Up</em></a> goes on to blame Brando for playing peekaboo with his penis in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/77724/last-tango-in-paris\" title=\"\"><em>Last Tango in Paris</em></a>: the winter cold of the apartment where the film was made gave the actor's tackle an attack of stage fright. With exemplary candour, Thomson insists that \"porn is movies, just like surveillance footage\". In a visual society, we have no secrets.</p> <p>As Thomson's wayward and digressive history nears the present, it strays into alarming terrain. He abhors TV (although he considers the old-time BBC to have been \"the best film studio there ever was\") because its screens hypnotise us without demanding either concentration or empathy: like electricity, it is a \"service\" we switch on, and what it provides is not light but \"a safeguard against disorder and fear\", enabling us to whistle in the dark. It has led to the frenzied fragmentation of YouTube, where you're only asked to look at bits or clips, \"the debris from an explosion in the culture\". We too have been atomised: film bifurcated reality, turned a person into an image. Everyone, whether or not they live in Essex or the <em>Big Brother</em> house, now stars in their own imaginary movie, or at least their personal sitcom. This, Thomson concludes, is \"the alienation that befalls people who live on or through screens\".</p> <p>Judgments like these, when Thomson makes them, have a rare moral force. Elsewhere he contrasts Chaplin's noisy, protesting silence with the stricken quiet of Buster Keaton, or calls the ape in <em>King Kong</em> a tragic lover whereas the shark in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36305/jaws\" title=\"\"><em>Jaws</em></a> is merely \"a vector in the game\". Breathtakingly, he says that the New York night in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/76628/sweet.smell.of.success\" title=\"\"><em>Sweet Smell of Success</em></a> is photographed to look like \"the hide of a crocodile in the moonlight\", and he likens the expression of Al Pacino in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36295/godfather\" title=\"\"><em>The Godfather</em></a> \u2013 a \"frozen stare as evil consumes him\" \u2013 to plastic surgery, transfixing his features in a rictus of terror. Cinema may have ended but Thomson's brain is the ultimate repertory theatre, perpetually rerunning our favourites and allowing us to wonder at them all over again. The highest praise I can give him is to say that the images he treasures are just as alive on his pages as they were on the big screen.</p>",
  "<p>Do you think like a psychopath? It has been claimed that one quick way of telling is to read the following story and see what answer to its final question first pops into your head:</p> <p>While attending her mother's funeral, a woman meets a man she's never seen before. She quickly believes him to be her soulmate and falls head over heels. But she forgets to ask for his number, and when the wake is over, try as she might, she can't track him down. A few days later she murders her sister. Why?</p> <p>If the first answer that springs to your mind is some variation of jealousy and revenge \u2013 she discovers her sister has been seeing the man behind her back \u2013 then you are in the clear. But if your first response to this puzzle is \"because she was hoping the man would turn up to her sister's funeral as well\", then by some accounts you have the qualities that might qualify you to be a cold-blooded killer \u2013 or a captain of industry, a nerveless surgeon, a recruit for the SAS \u2013 or which may well make you a commission-rich salesman, a winning barrister, a charismatic clergyman or a red-top journalist. The little parable purports to reveal those qualities \u2013 an absence of emotion in decision making, a cold focus on outcomes, an extremely ruthless and egocentric logic \u2013 which tend to show up in disproportionate degrees in all those individuals.</p> <p>There is a problem though. When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/search/results?query=Kevin+Dutton&amp;searchBy=all\" title=\"\">Kevin Dutton</a>, the author of this compulsive quest into the psychopathic mind, tried the question on some real psychopaths, not one of them came up with the \"second funeral\" motive. As one commented: \"I might be nuts but I'm not stupid.\"</p> <p>The admirable quality of this book is Dutton's refusal to accept easy answers in one of the more sensational fields of popular psychology. He comes at the challenge of deconstructing the advantages and dangers of psychopathic behaviour with two distinct motivations. First, the academic rigour of a research fellow at Magdalen College, Oxford. Second, with the more human need to understand the character of his late father, a market trader in the East End, a man with an \"uncanny knack of getting exactly what he wanted\", who could sell anything to anybody, because to him \"there were no such things as clouds, only silver linings\". Psychopaths, we learn, are the ultimate optimists; they always think things will work in their favour.</p> <p>Dutton's curiosity takes him from boardrooms and law courts to neurological labs. He tries in different ways to get inside the heads of those individuals for whom killing has been a way of life \u2013 from <em>Bravo Two Zero</em>'s Andy McNab to the video game-obsessed inmates of Broadmoor's secure wards. In his effort to get to their truths he has a tendency to write with the one-tone-fits-all breeziness of the excited enthusiast; at certain points his insistent chattiness jars. Though he demonstrates few of the characteristics of psychopaths himself, none of the limited range of cold fury of Viking \"berserkers\" or the wilful icy detachment of brain surgeons, he is in thrall to their possibilities. Perhaps, he argues, we all are.</p> <p>Dutton's book at any rate supports the idea that to thrive a society needs its share of psychopaths \u2013 about 10%. It not only shows the value of the emotionally detached mind in bomb disposal but also the uses of the psychopath's ability to intuit anxiety as demonstrated by, for example, customs officials. Along the way his analysis tends to reinforce the idea that the chemistry of megalomania which characterises the psychopathic criminal mind is a close cousin to the set of traits often best rewarded by capitalism. Dutton draws on a 2005 study that compared the profiles of business leaders with those of hospitalised criminals to reveal that a number of psychopathic attributes were arguably more common in the boardroom than the padded cell: notably superficial charm, egocentricity, independence and restricted focus. The key difference was that the MBAs and CEOs were encouraged to exhibit these qualities in social rather than antisocial contexts.</p> <p>As Dutton details this relationship, part of you is left wondering if the judge who recently praised a housebreaker for his courage and resourcefulness, and expressed the hope that in the future he might use his energies in more constructive directions, might have had Dutton's book by his bedside. Certainly you are left wondering if corporations that really want to find driven leaders might be as well to conduct their recruitment round in the juvenile courts as the universities. In this sense it is hard to know which is more chilling: the scene in which Dutton weighs a serial killer's brain in his hands and reveals it to be in no way tangibly different from yours or mine, or the research that shows the ability of American college students to empathise with others has, in the past 30 years, reduced by 40%\u2026</p>",
  "<p>Here's the thing, as Robert Peston compulsively remarks online, on air and in print: how come many acclaimed experts \u2013 Gordon Brown, Alan Greenspan, Hank Paulson, Fred the Shred and Merv the Swerve \u2013 got it so calamitously wrong? How come they were all credit-crunched in 2008 and 2009? Even Peston wasn't infallible. He could see desolation arriving but not to a precise schedule, not so that he could raise his voice in BBC editorial meetings and demand a special timber-shivering spot on <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/default.stm\" title=\"\"><em>Today</em></a>. This mess caught everyone flat-footed \u2013 and by far the best half of his book is explaining how and why.</p> <p>Peston, to be fair, did know that something was drastically wrong. He got his famous Northern Rock scoop because he'd spotted that the Rock \u2013 overleveraged, overborrowed, overconfident that the good times would roll on for ever \u2013 was patently vulnerable once confidence wobbled. He was waiting for the Bank of England to lurch to the rescue: his exclusive was rooted in analysis. But he's utterly right \u2013 here's another thing! \u2013 to turn some of his fire on journalists themselves, on the dogs that&#xa0;didn't bark.</p> <p>Begin with newspaper editors who \"rarely knew much about business and the economy and couldn't have cared less\" about the continuing yarn of who was up or down on the stock market that day. Ask where, apart from the very specialist press, you could find any coverage of bond markets, derivatives, foreign exchange markets and, crucially, debt markets. \"For years all this borrowing and lending was thought of as the equivalent of a sewage system or an electricity grid \u2013 necessary but dull.\" Yet suddenly the sewage started to swill down Threadneedle Street as the grid went up in flames.</p> <p>Peston, from his earlier stints on the <em>Investors Chronicle</em> and the <em>FT</em>, was more up to speed than most. He'd followed the mushroom growth of foreign exchange trading, bond markets, the whole derivatives industry offering you a speculative punt-cum-malign insurance hedge bet on \"the weather in the Caribbean, the unemployment rate in Japan, the risk of political unrest in China\". Make that $43&#xa0;trillion of unallocated loans, around 61% of global GDP. Set these swirling currents of funny money flowing across the world each morning against the shrinking reserves that banks were required to keep liquid and guard against very rainy days, and anyone who understood the true situation could see big, big trouble&#xa0;building. But who, in reality, spotted such looming&#xa0;peril?</p> <p>You can excuse the <em>FT</em> a few boots, give a nod of approval to a small group of watchful pundits; but the list of those who seemed asleep at the wheel is jolting. The press didn't sound the alarm; MPs couldn't tell their credit default swaps from the holes in their socks; the Treasury and its dominant minister \u2013 \"No more boom and bust\" \u2013 looked idiotic the moment the tsunami struck. The feted CEOs of the City's great financial institutions were as far off the pace as any. Maybe greed \u2013 and the fact that the more leveraged you were the fatter the profits you could make, and then pay yourself \u2013 blinded them to the risks they were taking. But maybe, too, they didn't fully comprehend how exposed that left them. Maybe, like so much of a Britain gorged on easy credit over two decades, they didn't understand the state they and we were all in.</p> <p>And \"understanding\", again, is the key word for the future: understanding that one version of capitalism has failed, understanding that we have to boost banks' reserves, regulate their borrowing, get a handle on the casino markets that stretch from Shanghai to Leadenhall Street. It isn't just bankers' bonuses or City pay scales in general that matter. It's understanding what's going on so that we can control it better \u2013 and there's the rub.</p> <p>Do we understand the arcane but decisive markets any more clearly than we did a decade ago? Does George Osborne exude a detailed mastery of his brief, or Ed Balls convince us that just a little more juice would help the engine tick back towards former glories? Have we absorbed the harsh lessons \u2013 here repeated \u2013 about borrowing more today than we can possibly pay back tomorrow? (See homilies about kick-starting growth that, in truth, can probably be forgotten for another 10 years or more).</p> <p>There's a chilling moment Peston recalls from <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01gvryl\" title=\"\">Sir Mervyn King's <em>Today</em> lecture this year</a>, where the Governor says frankly that \"we should have shouted from the rooftops that a system had been built in which the banks were too important to fail\". It's almost a mea culpa, says Peston: but not quite. \"For it was prefaced by 'with the benefit of hindsight' \u2013 and when any of us say 'if I knew then what I know now', we are excusing ourselves, not apologising.\"</p> <p>It's sensible to say that Peston has less to apologise for than many, and to add that his discursive, conversational but entrancingly fact-studded trip around the disaster zone ought to be mandatory reading for anyone who wants to have a voice in where we go from here. Peston and his more shadowy co-author, Laurence Knight, have performed a signal service.</p> <p>But it is also fair to say that their description of how we got into this mess is much more compelling than their prescriptions for how we get out of it, which tend to be now conventional calls for more rigid regulation, more visionary leadership, more public acceptance of hardship and toil. Well, yes: with the benefit of hindsight, that's all fine and dandy. But as a way out of the swamp it doesn't seem overwhelmingly convincing.</p> <p>Peston's last chapter \u2013 rather obviously added near close of publisher play \u2013 is all about rigging the Libor rate and the horror of Barclays. Did he, or anyone else, see that coming when he started on chapter one? And if not, how do we expect to clear away the debris of the past? We may know, in infinite, grisly detail, what <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/28/andrew-mitchell-accuses-media-pleb-row\" title=\"\">Andrew Mitchell</a> said to a policeman in Downing Street, stuff we can debate over a pint without breaking sweat. But when the real stories seize us by the throat, are we any less in the dark than before?</p>",
  "<p>Smartphone users are putting themselves at risk of having their identities stolen by failing to log out of apps and clear their browser histories.</p> <p>A survey by credit reference agency Equifax has found that while more than a quarter of people do online banking on their phone, a third don't log out of social media or banking websites, 42% fail to clear their browser history and 45% do not protect their smartphones with passwords.</p> <p>Even worse, one in five store passwords, pins, bank account or credit card details on their smartphones. All this makes it easier for fraudsters to access personal information, including bank details, if phones are lost or stolen.</p> <p>\"More and more people are using smartphones for all aspects of their life and enjoy the convenience of shopping and banking on the go,\" says Neil Munroe, chair of the Identity Fraud Communications Awareness Group. \"But it seems many users don't realise just how much data they are holding and how at risk their identity could be. There seems to be a culture of 'it couldn't happen to me'. A stolen phone can provide all the passwords, email addresses, telephone numbers and personal information criminals need to open new accounts and rack up huge debts in the victim's name.\"</p> <p>Even logging out of apps and clearing your history may not be enough to protect your personal details. Ed Woodcock, an IT specialist, believed he knew enough to make sure his personal information was secure. Even so, thieves obtained his personal and bank account details.</p> <p>Evidence of something going awry emerged on 27 September when he tried to log into his online bank account and was asked to prove who he was by entering some personal details. The criminals had changed his email address to their own to access his account, then changed it back again so their email address could not be traced. At the time, Woodcock assumed he'd typed in his details incorrectly so didn't check out the problem with his bank.</p> <p>Next day he logged in and discovered fraudsters had used NatWest's mobile app to transfer \u00a31,500 from a savings account to his current account, then made several withdrawals totalling \u00a3830 via the bank's emergency cash scheme before he managed to get his account blocked.</p> <p>Woodcock says: \"I had my phone on me the whole time, so I'm not sure how they got my details or into my account. But it has made me much more wary about where I do my online banking: I'll only do it on a device I'm absolutely sure of in an environment that is secure \u2013 so no more logging on in internet cafes or using free Wi-Fi on trains.\"</p> <p>He has also been through all the apps on his phone to check for rogue ones and to see what information legitimate ones have access to, deleting those which accessed sensitive data such as his text messages.</p>",
  "<p>Jeremy Hunt has only been in position as health secretary for five minutes and already is repeating his private view that the legal abortion limit should be cut from 24 weeks gestation to 12, citing unspecified \"evidence\".</p> <p>I am glad that David Cameron has made it clear that the government has no intention of changing the law on a subject that has in any case always been decided freely by parliament. If he is concerned at the high number of abortions, he will find that the UK figures are broadly in line with most European countries, and a good deal lower than in the US, where abortion remains a contentious political issue.</p> <p>Like most people, I would like to see fewer abortions, but the correct way to tackle that is through moral and sex education and the better provision of family planning, not in making access to abortion more restrictive.</p> <p>Hunt may be confused about the state of the law in several neighbouring countries, where abortion is legally available on request during the first trimester, and on a more restrictive basis after that. If there were to be any change to the Abortion Act 1967, it should be after rigorous impartial inquiry looking at all such options.</p> <p>The present law is upheld by most branches of the medical profession as being easily interpreted and understood. Only yesterday, a retired medical professor from the University of Edinburgh told me at a social function in the City that he was a student the day the Abortion Act became law. His lecturer held up a copy of the act and said to the class: \"This is a historic day because your generation of doctors will never have to confront the consequences of botched abortions.\"</p> <p>Our hospitals have since been free of wards cluttered with patients admitted for \"septic or incomplete abortion\" and our death statistics no longer show 30 to 50 annual fatalities from illegal abortion.</p> <p>Hunt is entitled to his personal views, but as secretary of state for health he should not be contemplating putting back the clock for the women of this country.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I don't miss television at all.</strong> I had done enough. By the time I finished, Richard [Madeley, her husband] and I had done it for 21 years. In the end it just gets to you.

  "<p>In my early teens we used to play a history game: name the period you'd most like to live in. I always ended up choosing the present. I reckoned my chances as a woman were better that way.</p> <p>Steven Pinker has confirmed my instinct. In over 700 fact-laden pages he shows there is far less violence today than ever before. (That \"today\" includes the Holocaust, Vietnam, the 20th-century genocides and suicide bombers.) Pinker knows he's bucking the gloom-and-doom trend but he's got containers full of evidence for ammunition, plus backup from the cognitive and evolutionary scientists.</p> <p>Proving things have got better turns out to be far more bracing than ushering in the apocalypse. There's irreverent relish to be had in recounting the gorier barbarities of the Bible with its 1.2 million deaths, of the Roman Colosseum, of the ordeals of the saints and of Inquisition torture. In one of his astonishing charts, Pinker ranks the death tolls of major historical conflicts, adjusted for population growth. First is the Tang Dynasty An Lushan Revolt of the 8th century (death toll in mid-20th-century terms: 429,000,000) with the 13th-century Mongol conquests close behind. The second world war, with its 55,000,000 dead, ranks a mere 9th and Stalin's purges and Gulag 15th.</p> <p>So what has made human beings less violent? Pinker organises his history through six trends. First is the \"pacification process\": the shift from hunting and gathering to the first agricultural civilisations, bringing a fivefold decrease in violent death. Next is the \"civilising process\", starting in the late middle ages. Then comes the \"humanitarian revolution\" of the 15th to 18th centuries, gradually reducing despotism, judicial torture and duelling. Finally there's the \"long peace\" following the second world war and the \"new peace\" after the fall of communism: both periods are notable for their championing of human rights and a growing disapproval of everyday aggression. We're hardly angels yet but we have become a far less brutally cruel and more peace-loving species.</p> <p>My only cavil is with Pinker's chapters on cognitive science. Here the rosy gaze on the growing humaneness of our species moves inward to mind, brain and behaviour. Pinker raises the possibility that recent biological evolution may have checked our inclinations towards violence, that somehow all our more angelic habits \u2013 delaying gratification, self-control, empathy, increased use of reason, movement away from superstition \u2013 may have had some biological effect on the hard-wiring of our brains. But the time scale of just a few centuries is far too short for the work of natural selection. Too bad. I'm sure Pinker would have liked to use it as yet more evidence in his spirited defence of modern civilisation. </p> <p><em>Lisa Appignanesi's latest book is </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/society/9781844085897/all-about-love-anatomy-of-an-unruly-emotion\" title=\"\"><em>All About Love: Anatomy of an Unruly Emotion</em></a><em> (Virago/ Little, Brown)</em></p>",
  "<p>There's a great moment when the dust-caked heroes of <em>On the Road</em> reach Ozona, Texas, on the way to El Paso. Dean Moriarty decides they should loosen up a bit. \"Disemburden yourselves of all that clothes!\" he advises. \"What's the <em>sense</em> of clothes?\"</p> <p>His obliging wife, Marylou, gets her kit off, and his friend Sal Paradise does the same. They're in one of those broad-beamed old cars with a bench for a front seat, heading west into the setting sun. \"Every now and then a big truck zoomed by; the driver in the high cab caught a glimpse of a golden beauty sitting naked with two naked men. You could see them swerve a moment&#xa0;as they vanished in our rear\u2011view&#xa0;window.\"</p> <p>We never quite managed this scene but we came close to a few others. Thirty years after Jack Kerouac's fabled odyssey, my girlfriend Annie and I had just left college and were hitchhiking across America. <em>On the Road</em> was still wildly romantic in the late 70s: if you wanted reckless adventure you bought a copy and simply followed the instructions. We knew it wasn't fiction but a series of real journeys the author had taken between 1947 and 1950, the names changed to protect the guilty, and that made it all the more thrilling. Beneath bruised purple dusks and swirling grey dawns, he had hitched, hopped trains and buses, and torn across what he called the Promised Land in a succession of beat-up cars, \"balling the jack\" in sleep-deprived pursuit of some kind of self-discovery. Around him was a rogues' gallery of extraordinary characters \u2013 snake-hipped jazzers, smoke-stained prophets, blue-eyed beautiful girls, artists, poets, pool sharks, Buddhists, hookers eating doughnuts, gamblers, rustlers, car thieves, thin-stemmed waifs in a Benzedrine haze and hobos flooring bottles of \"rotgut\" and 35-cent quarts of Californian port.</p> <p>To be fair, most of this sounded a bit frightening. Kerouac (in the guise of Sal Paradise) saw himself as the nerve-centre of a control experiment mapping the outer limits of human experience, at one point enthusiastically entering a hustlers' bar on Eighth Avenue full of \"wild negro queers, sullen guys with guns, shiv-packing seamen, thin noncommittal junkies and an occasional well-dressed middle-aged detective posing as a bookie\". We wanted a walk on the wild side, too, but with some art galleries thrown in, and maybe a trip to Disneyland. We'd be sending the odd postcard home.</p> <p>At various magical moments our route crossed the hallowed tracks traversed in <em>On the Road</em>. We hitched through Des Moines, whose tedious sprawl wasn't quite the funky suburb of gonzo legend. We saw the fizzing blues bars of Chicago's Madison Street. We swung by the \"little fishing village of Sausalito\" \u2013 which by 1977 was a bohemian art commune full of barge-dwelling hippies. We caught a ride to New Orleans and saw the creaky old jazz bands in Preservation Hall. We even lived for a while on Kerouac's legendary diet of apple pie and ice-cream and, just as he'd observed, the portions got bigger and the ice-cream richer the farther south you travelled.</p> <p>Part of the rhythm of this deathless memoir was its manic urge to expose every nerve-ending to the elements, a mission rendered impossible by the air-conditioned transport of the modern world. Kerouac marinaded his readers in all the scented flavours of his vast and exotic homeland \u2013 sights such as the thunderheads over Bear Mountain and \"the sun the colour of pressed grapes\", the sound of its jukejoints and rattling boxcars, the soft fragrance of wood smoke and chilli beans as he neared the Mexican border. At one memorable moment he watched the Mississippi river \"with its big rank smell that smells like the raw body of America&#xa0;itself\".</p> <p>When eventually published in 1957, <em>On the Road</em> was both roundly slated and praised to the rafters. It's not hard to see why it caused such a commotion. \"Somewhere along the line I knew there'd be girls, visions, everything,\" Kerouac famously observes at the start. \"Somewhere along the line the pearl would be handed to me.\" But to its admirers the book was a mind-loosening catapult through the doors of perception to wring every last drop of experience from some galaxy waiting to be discovered. The <em>New York Times</em> called it \"the most beautifully executed, the clearest and the most important utterance yet made by the generation Kerouac himself named years ago as 'Beat' and whose principal avatar he is\".</p> <p>In a perfect piece of self-mythology, its author claimed he'd typed it on to one continuous 120ft taped-together roll of teleprinter paper in a manic three-week writing jag in the spring of 1951, sustained by pea soup, coffee and \"bennies\" (indeed he <em>did</em> originally and the hallowed scroll still exists and is <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/whatson/exhibitions/kerouac/index.html\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">currently on display in the British Library</a>). But an old girlfriend, Joyce Johnson, recently told the <em>Observer</em> he'd actually spent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/16/jack-kerouac-ex-girlfriend\" title=\"\">years revising the work</a>, carefully crafting each paragraph \"like a poem\".</p> <p>Whatever, the style was extraordinary, hugely influenced by the prose explosions of his hero James Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em> and, rhythmically, by the arrival of bebop. Someone once pointed out that the book was born at the moment jazz was evolving from Charlie Parker to Miles Davis, and it's true: you can hear both Parker's frantic locomotion and the elegiac overtones of Davis in this sparkling moment when Sal and Dean enter a dive bar in San Francisco's Folsom Street: \"Boom, kick, that drummer was kicking his drums down the cellar and rolling the beats upstairs with his murderous sticks, rattlety-boom! A big fat man was jumping on the platform making it sag and creak \u2013 'Yoo!' The tenorman was drawing his breath for another blast \u2013 Chinese chords, shuddering the piano in every timber, chink and wire \u2013 boing!\" It still crackles today; you can practically smell the tobacco smoke and taste the iced bourbon and tap water.</p> <p>But the book's real influence was something else entirely. The network of interstate highways was in place in the late 40s but used mostly for commercial traffic. No one had explored its real potential. Kerouac's adrenalised bursts from coast to coast in a blizzard of speeding tickets somehow made the country seem smaller. You could drive from New York to LA on six tanks of cheap fuel! The endless big-sky landscapes were a metaphor for the limitless possibilities of mental and physical adventure, and your classless ragtag band of fellow travellers were the portals to a brave new liberated world.</p> <p>Would the Stones have ever covered Route 66 if they hadn't read <em>On the Road</em>? Would Chuck Berry have written Promised Land (\"I left my home in Norfolk Virginia, California on my mind/ Straddled that Greyhound, rode him past Raleigh and on across Caroline\")? Would anyone have filmed <em>Easy Rider</em> or <em>Paris, Texas</em> or even <em>Thelma and Louise</em>? Could <em>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</em> have happened without it? Would Paul Simon have taken four days to hitchhike from Saginaw in his quest \"to look for America\"? Kris Kristofferson's Me and Bobby McGee virtually is <em>On the Road</em>. The windblown visions of 70s rock bands such as the Eagles and the Grateful Dead seem unimaginable without it, as does the warm tarmac of Bruce Springsteen's open-road fantasy. Nirvana and U2 both collaborated with William Burroughs (the morphine-addicted Old Bull Lee in the book) and the Clash with Allen Ginsberg (who's Carlo Marx). Tom Waits wrote a song called Jack and Neal (Neal, of course, being Neal Cassady, the real-life Dean Moriarty and the lunatic driver of Ken Kesey's bus chronicled in Tom Wolfe's <em>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</em>). Kerouac turns up in lyrics by Belle &amp; Sebastian, 10,000 Maniacs, the&#xa0;Go-Betweens, Morphine and Beastie Boys. Even the pulsing electronic soundscapes of Brian Eno or Moby seem to have echoes in the book's endless space and sense of&#xa0;adventure.</p> <p>But the key torch-bearer is Bob Dylan. \"<em>On the Road</em> had been like a bible for me,\" he said in his memoir <em>Chronicles: Volume One</em>. \"I loved the breathless, dynamic bop poetry phrases that flowed from Jack's pen,\" and the way the author was magnetically drawn to \"the mad people \u2013 the ones who were mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn. And I felt like I fit right into that bunch.\" The cast of grotesques in Dylan's Desolation Row is all the verve and lunacy of <em>On the Road</em> compressed into 11 minutes 21&#xa0;seconds.</p> <p>Sadly, the people who seemed to benefit least from the book were its two leading lights themselves. Neal Cassady's chequered life would have given even Jerry Lee Lewis a run for his money \u2013 in and out of reform school, he'd married a 15-year-old girl, been tossed into San Quentin and died of an accidental barbiturate overdose on a Mexican railway track at the age of 42. But Jack Kerouac's fate seemed somehow worse. Unable to handle his celebrity, he eventually succumbed to booze-related liver failure at the age of 47.</p> <p>The latest extension of his legend is now finally with us, the movie that's taken 55 years to emerge, despite Kerouac's letter to Marlon Brando in 1957 urging him to buy the film rights&#xa0;and play the role of Moriarty \u2013 \"you play Dean and I'll play Sal and I'll&#xa0;show you how Dean acts in real life\". I can picture them now in that scene where the two of them slide off from the grape harvest in Bakersfield to lie under stars, Kerouac expressing all the drive and optimism of his early years, the pearl being handed him on a plate.</p> <p>\"Ah it was a fine night, a warm night, a wine-drinking night, a moony night, and a night to hug your girl and talk and spit and be heavengoing,\" he declares. \"And this we did.\"</p>",
  "<p>For many, <em>On the Road</em> is primarily one for the boys. Jack Kerouac's obsession with the egotistical and hedonistic drifter Neal Cassady dominates the book, with the female characters relegated to the back seat, disposable objects that float in and out of the tale at the convenience of the proto-beat lads.</p> <p>That's one view. But to director Walter Salles, the novel's female characters, especially those based on Cassady's long-suffering wives, are \"the silent heroines\" of the piece. Accordingly, he has cast two of Hollywood's most sought-after actresses \u2013 Kristen Stewart and Kirsten Dunst \u2013 to play them.</p> <p>Stewart is Marylou, the book's version of Cassady's first wife, LuAnne Henderson, who joined Cassady and Kerouac on their road trips across America; Dunst is Camille, aka second wife Carolyn Cassady, who stayed at home with the babies in San Francisco. Cassady flitted between these women, sleeping with Carolyn while married to LuAnne, keeping LuAnne as a lover after he had divorced her for Carolyn. Kerouac made little effort to give his female friends depth and dignity on the page; the film attempts to remedy that oversight.</p> <p>Stewart's prominence in the promotion of the film reflects both that intention and the <em>Twilight</em> star's high profile. The 22-year-old also happens to be a surprisingly passionate fan of the book.</p> <p>\"<em>On the Road</em> was on the reading list in my freshman year and thank God, I chose it,\" she recalls. \"It looked much more fun than any of the others. I knew that it was about counterculture, and when you're 14 years old and putting ridiculous anarchy signs on your backpack that's just what you're drawn to.</p> <p>\"You know, I'm from the Valley. I come from a very comfortable, very fortunate household, but the kind where you can become lazy and complacent. So when I read <em>On the Road</em> I thought: I have to find people like this, who will push me, who don't compromise on their desires, even if they're different to the norm. It really did inform how I wanted&#xa0;to&#xa0;live.\"</p> <p>In this nonconformity, she's thinking of her character as much as the men. \"I love Marylou. In the book she's fun, she's sexy, she's vivid, she's progressive for her time. She jumps off the page and smacks you in the face.\"</p> <p>At the same time she admits that \"it's not a book about the girls, they're on the outside of things\", and that she had to depart from the story to flesh out the character. She met the late LuAnne Henderson's daughter, Anne Marie Santos, who \"helped me unlock her mother, connect me to her as a real person\", and listened to hours of taped interviews with LuAnne, made by the Kerouac biographer Gerald Nicosia, which proved to be revelatory.</p> <p>\"Suddenly LuAnne had a voice, and we all fell completely in love with her. Unlike the boys, she wasn't rebelling against anything, she was just being herself, being with the people she loved. For me, getting to know this woman made it so much easier to avoid the caricature of the sex object. LuAnne never made&#xa0;herself a commodity. And she really is this amazing link between the two boys; it's a grand statement to make, but that adventure might not have happened without&#xa0;her.\"</p> <p>Dunst, 30, recalls a different attitude to the book when she first read it. \"I was more drawn to female writers when I was younger \u2013 Sylvia Plath, Jane Austen, I loved the poetry of Edna St Vincent Millay. I only read <em>On the Road</em> because there was a guy who I had a crush on and that was his favourite book. So I kind of read it to be cool. But I was very young, 16 years old, and didn't really get it.\"</p> <p>That said, she joined the film because \"it's one of the great novels in American history, so of course you want to be a part of that\". Moreover, she read and felt a strong connection to Carolyn Cassady's own, autobiographical account of that time, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780948238376/off-the-road-twenty-years-with-cassady-kerouac-and-ginsberg\" title=\"\"><em>Off the Road</em></a>, lines from which actually made their way into the film's&#xa0;screenplay.</p> <p>\"Carolyn is still alive, living in London. I missed the opportunity to meet her, but her book is what I based my choices on. For that period she was such a renaissance woman. She had a master's degree in theatre, and was a graceful, accomplished woman in her own right, but worked as a nurse to care for her&#xa0;children.</p> <p>\"She could have done a lot had she followed another path. But she met Neal and fell in love with him, it was as simple as that. He was so charismatic and handsome, and she was drawn to him like everyone else was, like a moth to a flame, no matter how much he would hurt her. I think it was amazing the way she lived on her own, raising the kids on her own, but was still generous in the love she had for both Neal and&#xa0;Jack.\"</p> <p>The two actors had very different experiences making the film, in keeping with their characters. As the isolated Camille, who never got to gallivant in the Hudson Hornet, Dunst didn't meet her co-stars until late in the shoot; in contrast, Stewart was immersed in the bootcamp that Salles set up in Montreal as a research base for his cast, and the intimacy she developed with Garrett Hedlund and Sam Riley is evident on screen \u2013 on the road, in super-charged dance scenes with Hedlund, and love scenes that might surprise <em>Twilight</em>&#xa0;fans.</p> <p>\"The bootcamp was about so much more than research,\" she says. \"We got to know one another so well. Garrett, Sam and I needed to feel safe and completely willing to lose control with one another. And it's hard to do that for me, because I'm the opposite of my character. I'm usually pretty self-conscious, but I didn't care at all when I was with these guys. I got to live more in those four weeks than I usually do. This experience was unparalleled, for me.\"</p> <p>Despite Kerouac failing to do the women justice, Stewart and Dunst feel his celebrated work does have something to say for a modern audience. \"It's an inspiring story that opens your mind to other ways of living your life, and that's timeless,\" says Dunst.</p>",
  "<p>On the eve of a new James Bond film, actor Daniel Craig has given a heartbreaking interview to <em>Vanity Fair</em>.</p> <p>In taking on the role of the great spy, Craig revealed, he is forced to behave elegantly at all times, lest he betrays the image of 007.</p> <p>\"Back in the day,\" he said mournfully, \"you could go and have a drink in the bar, get drunk, fall over, have a good time, relax, whatever\u2026 [but now] I've got to be high-class. I've done a lot of things in my life. But you have to think in that way. Which is sad, because I like bars.\"</p> <p>Poor Daniel. Isn't it time the character was updated, to give the restricted star more flexibility in his social life? Let Bond live a little! He's been \"high-class\" for too many decades. Luckily, I hear that a new novel, featuring an entirely new take, is about to be adapted for the screen \u2013 and I've got my hands on an exclusive extract.</p> <p>Next week is the fifth anniversary of the death of my father. Anyone who remembers his writing will know that I am revealing this secret document with apologies to Alan Coren, God rest his beautiful soul.</p> <p>*************</p> <p><strong>Bond tensed in</strong> the darkness and reached for his shellsuit. There was somebody in the room.</p> <p>As he groped, his hand made contact with a warm body lying next to him. Female! Bond remembered now: it was the gorgeous Chinese-Russian model, Mai Pantzarov.</p> <p>Blessed with the delicate features and glossy black hair of her Oriental heritage, atop Soviet height and muscularity, Mai had draped herself over the bed wearing nothing but a corset and a smile. Bond couldn't wait to get that view again. He switched on the light.</p> <p>Ah, no, Bond's mistake; it was the fat girl from the pub. Mai Pantzarov was the one he'd seen in <em>Loaded</em>.</p> <p>With a blast of beer-scented yawn, she woke up.</p> <p>\"All right, Jim?\"</p> <p>Bond nodded, coughed something up and spat it in the waste bin. He reckoned he'd probably do her again anyway.</p> <p>First, though, he needed breakfast. Picking up the hotel phone, he rang down and ordered a couple of espressos and a basket of fresh croissants.</p> <p>\"What d'you think this is, the bleedin' Ritz?\" barked the disembodied voice. \"You'll find a kettle and some Mellow Bird's behind the trouser press.\"</p> <p>Bond staggered to the bathroom, surprised and pleased to find he was still wearing his trainers. Still box-fresh, they gleamed below his multi-coloured leg tattoo. Squinting down at it, Bond thought for the umpteenth time that he really must get that spelling mistake corrected.</p> <p>He looked blearily in the mirror. What had happened last night?</p> <p>He'd been to the ambassador's reception, he knew that much.</p> <p>\"Martini?\" the barman had crooned. \"Shaken not stirred?\"</p> <p>\"Actually no\", Bond had replied, \"I'll have a snakebite &amp; black. And some scratchings.\"</p> <p>Sneaking up the embassy stairs, Bond had found the microfilm exactly where M said it would be. Stuffing it in his pocket, he had garnered the whole Iranian nuclear plan for MI6.</p> <p>Then, abseiling from a second floor window (Bond couldn't quite remember why, when he might just as easily have gone back down the stairs), he had moved on to the Rat &amp; Parrot for the football.</p> <p>Hang on, it was all coming back to 007 now. He'd played a few games of darts, arm-wrestled that pitbull, done a tenner on the fruitie, picked up the fat girl and come straight here.</p> <p>Thank Christ for that. All he needed now was to retrieve the microfilm from the pocket of his Burberry tartan dinner jacket, drop it off at the SIS building and his mission was complete.</p> <p>Bond picked up his clothes from the bathroom floor, relieved to find them only lightly vomit-stained, and ferreted in the pockets. Empty!</p> <p>Well this was a buggering disaster.</p> <p>\"Can't stop for coffee!\" he shouted, experiencing a mild static shock as he sprinted back across the nylon carpet. \"Have to run!\"</p> <p>Arriving at MI6, he raced down a secret corridor. Miss Moneypenny was coming the other way, but Bond barely had time to leer down her top and go \"Phwoarr!\" as he hurried past.</p> <p>\"PASSWORD!\", demanded the electronic security voice at the end of the corridor.</p> <p>\"Majesty\", said Bond obediently.</p> <p>\"INCORRECT!\", the automaton replied.</p> <p>\"Cold war?\" said Bond.</p> <p>\"INCORRECT!\", shrieked the machine.</p> <p>\"Er\u2026 Universal Exports?\"</p> <p>\"Incorrect, incorrect, incorrect\", said the doorway, with a robotic sigh. \"Remember, it's got to be at least 19 letters, 12 of them digits, all case-sensitive and it might or might not be your mother's maiden name.\"</p> <p>Bond kicked the wall with frustration. What was it with passwords these days? They used to be such fun.</p> <p>\"Don't worry, 007, I'll let you in!\", cried the cheery voice of Q, coming up behind him. \"It'll give me the chance to tell you about a marvellous new gadget. It's even niftier than that pen that doubled as an anti-aircraft gun. You remember, the one you left in the betting shop?\"</p> <p>\"No time, old bean\", said Bond, leaping ahead and taking the stairs three at a time. Without even knocking, he barged into M's office where she was relaxing in front of an old episode of <em>Taggart</em>. M loved <em>Taggart</em>.</p> <p>She looked at him sternly. \"You've lost the microfilm, haven't you?\"</p> <p>\"I must have been robbed\", frowned Bond.</p> <p>\"You certainly were\", said M. \"By none other than Ernst Stavro Blofeld himself. He was audaciously disguised. You remember the barman at the embassy?\"</p> <p>\"Of course\", said Bond.</p> <p>\"Well, that wasn't him.\"</p> <p>M swivelled her laptop round to show Bond a photograph.</p> <p><em>\"The fat girl?</em>\"</p> <p>M nodded.</p> <p>\"But didn't I\u2026 didn't we\u2026?\"</p> <p>M nodded.</p> <p>Bond shrugged, and went back to the pub.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.victoriacoren.com\">www.victoriacoren.com</a></em></p>",
  "<p>'Daddy\" was the pet name for Jeremy Hunt, in the inappropriate text messages he used to share with the Murdoch PR, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Michel. They showed us, if nothing else, that when important principles are at stake, Hunt will not be found wanting. \"You have stamina, Daddy,\" Michel used to say. \"We all find it somewhere!\" would come the modest response. Perhaps this is why Cameron overlooked that particular disgrace and made Hunt, as health secretary, the public face of his party's new and unexpected anti-abortion crusade.</p> <p>But it would be sexist, as well as unwise, to underestimate the important work that has already been done to undermine existing law by Hunt's colleague, Maria Miller. In her first notable intervention as women's minister and a \"very modern feminist\", a tricky act to pull off in this extravagantly misogynistic government, she demonstrated how controlling women, in line with Hunt's contempt for their reproductive rights, can be portrayed as a passionate concern for their wellbeing.</p> <p>Miller's role is to offer an ostensibly enlightened, science-based approach to abortion law reform that is designed to look, ultimately, like an appealing alternative to Daddy Hunt's 12-week limit. Crudely, in the Tories' latest, unforgivable assault on women's interests, she plays the caring, feminist professional to Hunt's interfering zealot \u2013 a British version of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/03/todd-akin-stands-by-abortion-comments?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Todd Akin</a> who just happens to be running the health service.</p> <p>Asked if she would vote now, as she has before, to reduce the 24-week abortion time limit by a month, Miller told the <em>Telegraph</em> that she \"absolutely\" would, \"to reflect the way medical science has moved on\". No doubt she will, in time, inform a press that is apt to take such claims on trust, where exactly babies are surviving at 20 weeks, the point when women are screened for foetal abnormalities, or at 21 weeks, or beyond the occasional, miraculous exception, at 22 weeks. It is a myth. At 23 weeks, the very edge of survival, nine out of 100 babies survive, typically with disabilities. But misrepresenting viability figures is less important to Miller's position than her conviction that, no matter why a woman might think she needed a late abortion, she would be mistaken. \"You have got to look at these matters in a very commonsense way.\" She is driven, she says, \"by that very practical impact that late-term abortion has on women\".</p> <p>Miller was immediately congratulated by Nadine Dorries, Westminster's loudest anti-choice agitator, who is now threatening another 20-week vote, having told the <em>Guardian</em> her personal favourite would be 13 weeks. Presumably there is some scholarly disagreement with 12-week Daddy Hunt over the precise status of foetal rights in the intervening days. \"Maria Miller understands the importance of recognising some women are traumatised by abortion process, that's real feminism,\" Dorries tweeted.</p> <p>In just 140 characters, she could hardly be expected to balance this unusual definition of feminism with another well-recorded fact, that illegal abortions are not without their pitfalls. Last week, an alleged victim of Jimmy Savile, 16 when made pregnant, recalled a subsequent, illicit abortion. Performed by a GP without anaesthetic, it cost \u00a3150, for which she paid her grandmother back over two years. Today, admittedly, it is expected that women denied abortions by Jeremy Hunt would first seek prohibited abortifacients over the internet before resorting to local butchery.</p> <p>Miller is not the only combatant in today's abortion wars to have updated the traditional hellfire lectures about slaughtering the innocent and moral anarchy, illustrated by smiling foetuses, which have signally failed to dissuade the one in three women who undergo abortions. Instead, the emphasis is on the woman's personal suffering.</p> <p>Women who have been damned in the past for putting their trivial \"social\" concerns before the foetus they may however inadvertently have conceived are being assured that the decision whether to keep it is, indeed, more about wellbeing than a surrender to God's plan. From Miller, a teenager who is many weeks into a pregnancy she has concealed, or a woman who has just discovered, at the 20 week scan, a serious foetal abnormality, will learn that unwillingly giving birth is a healthier choice for <em>her</em>. Supposing, of course, Hunt's plan gives her a choice.</p> <p>This assessment of harms, \"common sense\" to Miller, is flatly contradicted by recent research. Yet it has been reported at face value. Perhaps the often uncritical repetition of trauma claims can partly be explained in guidelines from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, unsurprising to anyone who knows anything about abortion: \"For most women the decision to have an abortion is not easy and the experience is stressful and probably unpleasant.\" Even so, the principal finding of a \"systematic review of the mental health outcomes of induced abortions\", published last year by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, was this: \"The rates of mental health problems for women with an unwanted pregnancy were the same whether they had an abortion or gave birth.\"</p> <p>Comparing tactics, you could argue that Miller and Dorries's cod scientific claims about pre-term viability and proved maternal suffering are more insulting to the girls and women they hope to alarm, bamboozle and finally bounce into motherhood than the old ranting about mortal sins. Even Daddy Hunt, a homeopathy fan, insists that his arbitrary preference for 12 weeks over, say, 13 or 17 and a half, is not religious but came about after looking at \"the evidence\". It is a sense of his own god-like importance, as opposed to Holy Writ, that persuades him that his convictions on the moment a new life begins \u2013 \"it is just my view\" \u2013 should prevail over women's choices.</p> <p>In the face of distressing British Pregnancy Advisory Service documentation about the women who are most likely to present for very late abortions, which make up 1.4% of the total, Miller's parade of superior benevolence is disgusting. If, as she also pretends, viability were the issue, she would propose a reduction of one or two weeks, in line with the medical facts.</p> <p>In reality, her preference for 20 weeks is merely an opening bid, providing encouragement to Dorries, whose next abortion debate will allow fellow agitators to propose more repressive limits to women's choices, such as the 12 weeks for which Hunt has voted. He may yet become famous as the health secretary who revived Britain's pre-1967 market in illegal abortions.</p> <p>If it succeeds, Dorries' debate will produce a compromise of 20 weeks, the point when David Cameron personally believes he is entitled to force women into submitting to his prejudices on foetal life.</p> <p>Even a reduction of four weeks would introduce, as well as illegal operations, a new route in abortion tourism, from Britain to places such as the Netherlands, where late terminations are available for women who can afford them. Only poorer women will have to submit to Tory plans for their bodies. That's Conservative feminism.</p> <p>Comments will be turned on later this morning</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Family Bond</strong></h2> <p>The Broccolis and the Saltzmans used to play together. So Monday night was a bit of a reunion as the children of the James Bond producers \"Cubby\" Broccoli and Harry Saltzman gathered again at the premiere of <em>Everything or Nothing</em>, Stevan Riley's doc on the Bond phenomenon.</p> <p>Despite the squabbles chronicled in the greatly enjoyable documentary, relations are now such that families even got together on stage for an emotional Q&amp;A afterwards. Steven Saltzman, Harry's son, now living in Monaco, could hardly contain his thrill at finally getting to tell his dad's story, although there's more beside that thread in Riley's film. \"The thing that nobody knows is that Harry was a spy himself,\" he told me. \"So here was this man, creating spy movies, but his big secret all along was that he was a top-level spy. As kids we never knew, but we found out 10&#xa0;years&#xa0;ago.\"</p> <p>Also attending the film was director Hugh Hudson, patiently waiting for his beautiful Bond girl wife, Maryam d'Abo, to finish a round of interviews. The <em>Chariots of Fire</em> director is eyeing another film project, he tells me, but he is still revelling in the Olympian successes of the summer, which not only revived his Oscar-winning film but also gave him the opportunity, alongside Barbara Broccoli, to produce the new <a href=\"http://www.chariotsoffireonstage.com/team/\" title=\"\">West End stage play</a> based on it. \"That was a whole new experience for me and I loved it.

  "<p>Mark Schwarzer knows the day will come when his body screams enough is enough. His limbs will protest as he edges out of bed in the morning, the very thought of venturing into the chill of a winter drizzle to roll around in a muddy goalmouth enough to bring on all the aches and pains associated with the onset of middle age. It is just that, even with wisps of smoke still drifting from the candles on his 40th birthday cake, the Australian remains convinced that moment remains some way off. He still has too much to achieve.</p> <p>If Saturday was about celebrating becoming a quadragenarian then, at St Mary's this afternoon, Fulham's veteran will fling himself into a Premier League contest with the same vigour that marked his top-flight bow, for Middlesbrough at Sheffield Wednesday back in 1997. This will be his 475th game among England's elite, yet he is still hoping to add significantly to that tally and, in turn, his hundred-plus caps for Australia, having targeted a swansong at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. He is a stalwart of two clubs with whom he has graced Europa League finals but a goalkeeper still chasing the dream of the Champions League. \"They say you know when it's time to step aside,\" he says. \"Maybe I will but I've got goals ahead of me. It's all part of the grand plan.\"</p> <p>That strategy formulated early. It started back in Richmond, New South Wales, when he turned out for Colo Cougars' under-sevens and the local butcher reminded Schwarzer's mother, Doris, that \"soccer is for softies\"; or as a 10-year-old when he took up goalkeeping; or at 19 when he first donned the shin pads he has worn for games ever since. But, over a 22-year professional career that has taken him from Marconi Stallions to Teesside, via spells with Dynamo Dresden, Kaiserslautern and Bradford, and into a fifth season at Fulham, Schwarzer remains thirsty for more. Paulo Gazzaniga, who will shake his hand at Southampton today, is half his age but would do well to learn from the softie turned sporting icon in direct opposition.</p> <p>Longevity has offered Schwarzer a sense of perspective. Nothing seems to faze him, eager as he is to dissect everything from Australia's sporting crisis to gamesmanship or Fulham's summer of upheaval. The London club were in the bottom division when Schwarzer arrived at Valley Parade yet, like the goalkeeper, they are now established in the elite. Even so, there had been flutters of concern when Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Clint Dempsey departed for Tottenham Hotspur before the transfer deadline. \"The situation was very disruptive,\" he says. \"We played West Ham the day after the window closed and were very poor. The whole thing had unsettled us. But the guys who have come in have helped pick us up. They've all added quality and Dimitar Berbatov has given us something extra. Something we didn't have before.</p> <p>\"Whenever any player comes to the club you wonder if he'll fit in and flourish and if he'll reproduce the form he'd shown previously. But you could see straight away in training that the guy has amazing talent. It was just a matter of how long it would take him to gel with the team and Dimitar's settled in almost instantly and been outstanding: his commitment, his skill and vision on the ball, and the demands he makes of others. The younger players in particular, he's hard with them but also quick to praise them if they do something well. That's something we'd lost.</p> <p>\"We've lacked a bit of that, demanding players to produce at a high level. Berba's developed that attitude at Tottenham and Manchester United, expecting the best from everyone, and he's brought it here. As experienced players, we set the standard. Some would say the young guys get in too easily these days and then get carried away with themselves. It's our job to knock them down a couple of notches sometimes, give them a reality check, to get the best out of them. The whole club has to maintain momentum and evolve the style of football the manager wants. We've been too one-dimensional at times. The manager is changing that.\"</p> <p>Others have found that process unacceptable. Bobby Zamora endured a fractious relationship with Martin Jol last season and was one of six high-profile departures from Craven Cottage this calendar year. Last week, while Queens Park Rangers loiter at the foot, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/02/fulham-martin-jol-bobby-zamora\" title=\"\">the former England striker suggested \"the vast majority of players there now\" are unhappy with Jol</a>. \"Bobby had his issues with the manager and that's why he moved on,\" says Schwarzer. \"If people had a problem with the manager, you wouldn't have seen the successes or the performances we've shown so far this season. It would be impossible to do that. The players are all 100% behind the manager and, as far as I'm concerned, there's no validity to [Zamora's] statement at all.\"</p> <p>No other foreign import has played as many Premier League games as Schwarzer. So what had he made of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/01/sir-alex-ferguson-sergio-aguero\" title=\"\">Sergio Ag\u00fcero's comments after Manchester City's victory at Fulham last Saturday</a>, the Argentinian suggesting domestic referees are more sympathetic to local talent when it comes to players tumbling in the penalty box? \"I dive all the time and get nothing for it, so I fully understand what he's on about,\" says the goalkeeper with a grin. \"Seriously, he spoke about the penalty that was given to us [being soft], and that was won by John Arne Riise, so maybe he's got his nationalities a bit mixed up.</p> <p>\"Certain players tend to dive each week more than others and, all of a sudden, that reputation sticks. A lot of the time these guys have got only themselves to blame for having the odd call go against them because they're known for theatrics. I've played against 'foreign' players \u2013 I'm not naming names \u2013 who call for everything and anything that comes in the box.\"</p> <p>Has he not encountered English players going to ground too easily? \"To a lesser extent because I don't think it's in their nature. The English mind-set \u2013 the Australian's mind-set is very similar \u2013 is be hard but be fair. Players from different regions of the world view the game in different ways. Some see it as life and death and will do anything to win. I've played against teams from South America and Asia and some players will do whatever they possibly can to get a result or a decision. If that means cheating, they will. I've seen them. There are different codes of ethics all over the world. We talk about 'fair play' but one could argue some players are countering that by not playing in the spirit of the game.\"</p> <p>The goalkeeper experienced gamesmanship first-hand in the second leg of the World Cup play-off in Montevideo in 2001, when Australia were spat at, punched and robbed on arrival. On the evening of the game the rendition of their national anthem began mid-chorus, stopped, restarted and then fizzled out prematurely. The visitors were intimidated and duly overwhelmed. Four years later, again in a play-off, Guus Hiddink's team welcomed Uruguay to Sydney and three opposing players set upon the Socceroos' centre-half, Tony Popovic, in the tunnel. \"They knew he was hot-headed and might react. But to see them going for him \u2026 I can't fathom that. I don't know how I'd react if my manager told me: 'Go up to the other goalkeeper, pin him up against a wall and say something about his mother.' I couldn't do it.\"</p> <p>Australia prevailed that day, Schwarzer saving penalties from Dario Rodr\u00edguez and Marcelo Zalayeta in a shoot-out to propel his country to a first World Cup finals in 32 years. It remains his finest hour, an image of his decisive save engraved in the cut-glass trophy presented to him when he became the first Australian to accrue 100 caps last month. That occasion was in the unlikely setting of Beirut's Saida Municipal stadium in front of a crowd of 9,000, his team-mates wearing training gear with \"Schwarzer 100\" emblazoned in fluorescent yellow in the warm-up and Lucas Neill tossing him the captain's armband just before kick-off. \"To be the first to reach that landmark makes it all the more special,\" says the veteran, even if that friendly victory was unrepresentative of recent form, with the Socceroos having endured a stumbling start to their World Cup qualifying campaign. \"This is a transitional period. The reality is our success hangs on the quality of the players coming through and we need them to step up.\"</p> <p>The same could be said for Australian sport in general. Schwarzer enjoyed the Olympic Games this summer as a spectator, spending time at the beach volleyball and in the aquatics centre. His compatriots <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/29/london-2012-france-usa-freestyle-relay\" title=\"\">were expected to claim gold in the men's 4x100m freestyle relay on the night he went, only to finish fourth</a>. To end 10th in the medal table, with only seven golds, felt inadequate. \"By our high standards it's a crisis. There's been a really rough patch over the course of the last few years. It's starting to boil a bit. There are a lot of questions to be answered, especially after the Olympics. But when you consider the reality, it shouldn't come as a surprise.</p> <p>\"Look at the implications of funding having been cut back, as it has since Sydney in 2000. At one point during the Olympics, out of all the gold medals that had been won up to then, 18 had been by athletes coached by Australians. So we've exported our best coaches. We've got only ourselves to blame. It's very difficult to demand that success if you're not putting everything in to achieve it. Great Britain, like most host nations, threw a lot of money at it. Results speak for themselves. But it'll be what happens next that is interesting.\"</p> <p>The same applies to Schwarzer. The goalkeeper is out of contract next summer, with David Stockdale kicking his heels waiting for a chance to impress, but hopeful he can remain in England. He has his own ambitions: hoisting Fulham firmly into European contention; maybe even gracing the Champions League. That chance looked to have gone when he turned down Bayern Munich and Juventus to move to Craven Cottage in 2008 and again when the club rebuffed Arsenal's inquiries two years ago.</p> <p>\"It's still a dream,\" he adds. \"When I first moved to Fulham I thought it couldn't get any better than this and then you're linked to a club like Arsenal which was very flattering. The club were adamant I wasn't going anywhere and it's nice to be in that situation too. You can never say 'never'. It keeps you on your toes, having that desire in the back of your head. Whatever happens next summer, I'd love to stay in England. All I'm focusing on is playing well for Fulham, winning games, having a good season and qualifying for the World Cup with Australia.\"</p> <p>Those are immediate objectives. The aches and pains can wait.</p>",
  "<p>French clubs have gained a reputation for treating the Heineken Cup, or H Cup as it is known across the Channel, with a mixture of indifference and disdain, a tournament with an Anglo-Saxon disciplinary system that messes up the Top 14 schedule. Toulon, however, are taking it seriously.</p> <p>The club is not quite French in name only but it has assembled a foreign legion including Jonny Wilkinson who, having retired from international rugby after last year's World Cup, is focusing on a trophy that has eluded him.</p> <p>Newcastle qualified for the tournament only twice when Wilkinson was there, and he was injured when they played Stade Fran\u00e7ais in the quarter-final at Parc des Princes in 2005 and subsided to a 40-point defeat.</p> <p>\"The policy at Toulon is that every game is important, never mind which tournament it is in,\" says the former England fly-half who, at the age of 33, will decide at the end of the season whether to continue playing. \"It means everything to me to be successful in the Heineken Cup: it is the biggest club tournament in northern hemisphere rugby, all the top teams coming together in the ultimate competition. I would adore to be part of the winning team.\"</p> <p>Wilkinson's international career may not quite be over, even if he has no intention of making himself available for England again. He is being monitored by Warren Gatland ahead of next year's Lions tour of Australia, scene of the fly-half's greatest triumph in 2003 when his extra-time drop goal in Sydney won the World Cup for England.</p> <p>Wilkinson's 13 years with England did not end as he had intended. The wreckage of last year's World Cup campaign claimed a number of victims, not least the then team manager, Martin Johnson, the man whose hands clasped the Webb Ellis Cup that night in Sydney nine years ago.</p> <p>\"I have seen him since the World Cup,\" Wilkinson says. \"He was no more responsible than anyone else for what happened in New Zealand, including me. His input was outstanding and I have a huge amount of respect for him, even more so than I had when he was a player.</p> <p>\"The World Cup was a huge opportunity for us, but for whatever reason the cumulative sum of all of our efforts was not what it should have been and it was not reflected in our performances. We were not as together as we could or should have been; I have still not worked out why. Sometimes you play against a team and feel they have more men on the pitch than you: we did not have that.\"</p> <p>Wilkinson has been with Toulon for three years, relishing the warmer climate on the French Riviera, but he pays close attention to the game in England and believes the national side is making progress along a path that leads to the 2015 World Cup, which is being hosted by the Rugby Football Union.</p> <p>\"The autumn international series will be very big for England,\" he says. \"New Zealand are in a place where the players in the team know that someone will come up with the goods. England have good options in my position: Toby Flood has creativity and toughness and is looking like the finished article.</p> <p>\"Owen Farrell is young but has tenacity and mental toughness. You can build on that forever: he can go far because he has the base. In the midfield, Manu Tuilagi is an explosive player and England need the opposition to focus on certain players because it opens up space for everyone else. They key is to have, ruthless, mentally tough players and game-breakers who are willing to stand up and take the heat, and who can make decisions. England have a lot going for them.\"</p> <p>Any role at the 2015 World Cup, when England will be hosts, will be ambassadorial. Asked whether he will still be playing then, when he will be 36, Wilkinson says: \"I take things year by hear now because I like to be in control. I do not want to be playing when the guys alongside me would rather have someone else. If I feel I am doing well at the end of the season, I will keep going. When I do retire, skills coaching one-on-one is something that would interest me, but just because you get off the ladder as a player at a certain level, that does not mean that is where you should start as a coach. They key for me is to continue to get better.\"</p> <p>Toulon's first group match in the Heineken Cup is an all-French affair against Montpellier a week on Sunday. Then they go to Cardiff Blues before a double-header with Sale, home of Danny Cipriani, who not so long ago was one of the pretenders to Wilkinson's England shirt but now finds himself on the Sharks' bench, even though they are struggling. Wilkinson does not want to see 2003 as the climax of his career, but for his erstwhile rival it has become a question of lows.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I received a call from Redress Claims in May last year, offering to win me compensation for mis-sold payment protection insurance. They told me they operated on a no-win, no-fee basis.

  "<p>Modern communication devices have a lot to answer for. Not only do they communicate but, being modern, they do it instantly and effectively.</p> <p>If Roy Hodgson felt like banging his head against a brick wall the day he woke up to discover his charming but wildly naive tube excursion was all over the newspapers, complete with eerily unsettling photographs of the England manager smiling into the cameras of telephones that would shortly be contacting national newsdesks, it was nothing to the sinking feeling that Roberto Di Matteo encountered on being informed mid-press conference that Ashley Cole had just tweeted his verdict on the Football Association.</p> <p>The Chelsea full-back apologised for his petulant reaction, as did Hodgson for his rather less forgivable public discussion of Rio Ferdinand's international future, but in both cases the damage had already been done. That's life these days. Instant judgment, instant dissemination. You can try to go back and cover the traces but people know what they choose to remember.</p> <p>Hodgson will not go down in English football folklore as a jolly man of the people who freely chats to fellow commuters on the way to work, any more than Christian Gross did at Spurs. He has just earned himself a reputation as a silly old duffer who did not realise that what used to be private conversations are now saleable commodities.</p> <p>Cole has already gone down in English football folklore as a man of few words but some pithy and highly printable opinions, and thanks to Twitter the world can now share his latest intemperate outbursts long after he has thought better of them.</p> <p>In his defence, at least Cole did not sit on the fence. The FA's commission effectively called him a liar \u2013 the section of their report detailing his evidence refers to the \"evolution\" of his statement \u2013 and if he objected to that most people would back his right to say so in the most forthright of terms. Many might go even further and argue that having delivered his pronouncement Cole should have stuck to his guns, even though it seems to have occurred to the player on the way home from the Chelsea treatment room \u2013 where he \"saw the captions on the TV screens and tweeted my feelings in the heat of the moment\" \u2013 that such a confrontational stance might not be the wisest course of action for an England international on 98 caps.</p> <p>The FA seem positively eager to accept Cole's apology, perhaps recognising that <em>mea culpas</em> from the direction of Chelsea are almost collectable rarities, perhaps acknowledging that any major sanction such as curtailing his England career would be a farcical overreaction. Cole is a perfectly good left-back and the country would invite even more ridicule on itself were it to lose a third member of a once settled back line over events that either did or did not take place on the Queens Park Rangers pitch 12 months ago.</p> <p>To recap what scarcely needs recapping, this sorry saga has already cost England the services of Fabio Capello, John Terry and Rio Ferdinand, and adding Cole to the list would not only make the FA a laughing stock it would force Hodgson to consider his position, giving the story fresh legs which it might well use to run off in the direction of Harry Redknapp.</p> <p>Cole will probably have to be fined \u2013 because Rio Ferdinand was fined \u00a345,000 for his \"choc-ice\" tweet and it is important to appear even-handed \u2013 but after that the FA should just take the hit to try to draw a line under this apparently endless business. Likewise Terry should take the hint, forego his right to appeal, and get on with serving a suspension that now appears incongruously lenient.</p> <p>While Cole's language might have been uncalled for, few could pretend that this entire matter has been handled well by English football. It has taken up a whole year, for a start, proving a major distraction to England's preparations for Euro 2012, and despite the FA's protestations that was not just because the police decided to get involved and take the matter out of their hands. The police investigation was not helpful, and neither was the convenient ease with which Chelsea managed to get the court proceedings shifted back until after the European Championship, but as the FA were ultimately to ignore the fact that Terry had been found not guilty in a court of law it is hard to understand why they spent the first nine months dithering. Especially when their eventual punishment of a four-match suspension amounted to little more than a wrist-slap in the context of the three-match bans routinely handed out for merely physical transgressions. Even at this late stage the FA are still sending out mixed messages, and it is incomprehensible to most people why they continue to publicise the fact that they do not consider Terry a racist.</p> <p>Had they intervened and investigated at the earliest possible stage, there may even have been no need for police proceedings and unedifying courtroom revelations. The police only acted once a complaint had been received. It was none of their business until then, and it could be the case that the anonymous caller \u2013 or callers, though it is not thought there were many \u2013 may not have set the process in motion had the football authorities been seen to be dealing with it.</p> <p>Sepp Blatter drew widespread condemnation a year ago when he suggested incidents of racist abuse on the pitch should be settled by a handshake at the end of the game, and though it was fair to draw the conclusion that the Fifa president was speaking from his usual Swiss mountain top with only a distant view of real life taking place at ground level, he had a point in maintaining that speed is of the essence in these matters. A handshake at the end of the game would not have patched up the Anton Ferdinand-John Terry quarrel, nor the Luis Su\u00e1rez-Patrice Evra disagreement for that matter, but swift and business-like direction from the football authorities at the first sign of trouble might have prevented much of the unpleasantness that followed.</p> <p>What the game must not do again is sit back and let the clubs take charge, because that is how you end up with Liverpool's now notorious T-shirt gesture at Wigan last season, Su\u00e1rez declining to shake Evra's hand at Old Trafford, and Chelsea prolonging everyone's agony by getting Terry's court case put back until the end of the season. Meanwhile the two players worked on statements that would end up being dismissed as implausible.</p> <p>Wounds that are not treated immediately tend to fester, and before the Ferdinand-Terry case we hardly knew what festering meant. Considering the QPR player never heard the alleged insult at the time it is astonishing how the matter has dragged on, and who it has dragged down. Drawing a line in the sand is not easy when the sand has the consistency of mud and keeps shifting beneath the feet, but let us hope that between them the FA commission's report and Cole's reaction mean the end of this tiresome business is somewhere in sight.</p> <p>What we have all learned in the past 12 months is that racism in football needs to be taken seriously. What the game needs to do next is find a way to deal with it instantly. Follow the example of Hodgson's fellow commuters and Cole's instinctive recourse to Twitter, even when upset. Get it out there. Don't wait, act. There is nothing to be gained from hanging about.</p>",
  "<p>The fat red sun settles itself against the horizon, throwing a last, honey-sweet light through humid evening and over a&#xa0;small crowd on the lawn beside a railroad track that cuts through the cotton fields beyond. A quarter-moon rises and a chorus of cicadas serenades imminent twilight, now conjoined by the sound of the band; the drummer catches the backbeat and the compere announces: \"How about an Indianola hometown welcome for the one-and-only King of the Blues: BB KING!\"</p> <p>And on he comes, to applause from people who know him well and claim him as their own \u2013 the last of the blues masters a few weeks short of his 87th birthday. \"Nice evening, isn't it?\" he says, and introduces his nephew on sax. Some of his 15 children (all by different mothers) and innumerable grandchildren are in the audience, though one of his daughters died recently of diabetes, as had BB's mother \u2013 a poignant riptide beneath the occasion. \"I guess you can look at me,\" he says from the stage, \"and tell I'm the old man.

The town has come to hear its famous son: mostly black people \u2013 in families, many with a picnic \u2013 plus a few whites with ponytails, ZZ Top beards or other gestures of nonconformity. There are people here like Alfred Knox \u2013 one of 11 children with eight of his own (and 21 grandchildren) \u2013 who left Mississippi for Milwaukee when he was 19, the sound of Honeyboy Edwards playing juke joints ringing in his ears, and has now come back with his nephew Gervis to hear BB, to hear and talk blues, talk politics. The usual jocks and suits who wave bottles of Bud and shout at tourist clubs like BB King's own franchise in Memphis are not here for this annual homecoming concert \u2013 oddly, but thank God.</p> <p>Nor, indeed, are some of Indianola's good citizens. Latunya and her friend were in the post office earlier, and said how \"We're real excited BB's coming back. Gee, I'd lo-o-ove to go see him play. But I go out Fridays. I don't go out Wednesdays, I only go out Fridays\". This is also the town in which the White Citizens Council was formed, political wing of the Ku Klux Klan; and the founders' heirs are probably elsewhere tonight.</p> <p>The maestro's sonority on guitar is as inimitably perfect as ever. After one long, searing note during \"The Thrill is Gone\", BB King darts the stare of a clown right into the front rows, as though to say: \"How about that!?\" But it is BB's voice on the warm breeze that stops a heartbeat \u2013 that feeling behind and between the words that is the quintessence of the blues.</p> <p>This is the 35th Homecoming concert, an event initially staged in memory of Medgar Evers, the civil rights activist and friend of BB's assassinated by a member of the White Citizens' Council. There is something important about BB King's appearance, for the simple reason that even if he is still touring as a 90-something, there will not be that many more of these; nor will there be occasions upon which this great man will reflect on his extraordinary life, which began when he was working out there on the cotton plantations, living alone in a shack, having outlived his mother and then his grandmother.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-396733357\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/26/1348673197204/BB-King-clip-1-013.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/9/26/120926BBKingClip1-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/9/26/120926BBKingClip1-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120926BBKingClip1/120926BBKingClip1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/9/26/120926BBKingClip1_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video>   <p>All the more reason for that remarkable life to be recounted on film. Jon Brewer's<em> The Life of Riley</em>, released next month, was made after hours talking with BB King, with those who grew up around him, and those \u2013 including many British musicians \u2013 who followed his example. This is the definitive filmed testimony of the last great bluesman.</p> <p>Even more important than the tributes from stars \u2013 Eric Clapton, Keith Richards, Bono et al \u2013 are the recollections of people like John Fair and Clemmie Trevellaine, who sit on the porch of their home remembering the day that nine-year-old Riley B King cycled home to live among the cotton fields, working behind a plough, holding the reins of a mule. \"I knew none of this,\" says Brewer. \"I had no idea this had been BB King's life. That he lived alone, in a shack out there, at nine years of age, working for four years to pay off his dead mother's and grandmother's debts. I never knew he was so alone, talking to rabbits, his only friends. And by the time he's telling me this, I'm in tears.\"</p> <p>So it's also a good time for the <em>Observer</em> to speak directly to the master in his hometown, just after his bus pulled up in BB King Street, where, before performing, he broke ground for a new pavement complete with flagstones which will tell his life story. The story he now talks about as we sit in the shade of a pecan tree: : \"I don't do this,\" he smiles, \"but I heard you come all the way from England\". \"Got here a short while ago\", I replied, \"two hours sleep \u2013 and I never thought I'd see the day, when I was 16 and bought this\" \u2013 it's a copy of his album, Indianola Mississippi Seeds. BB laughs and signs the record; his affection for England is musical, not sentimental.</p> <p>There's a turn off the main road into town that leads through the low-slung fields to Itta Bena. The season is waning now: just north of here around Clarksdale, capital of the blues, little clouds of cotton have burst forth \"like popcorn\", as John Steinbeck once remarked; here the white puffs remain closed in their pods. When he was a boy, BB King used to drive his mule through those fields while his Uncle Jack, up front, sung \"the holler\", the descendant of the slave chants and responses, wherein the blues began.</p> <p>\"I remember the holler,\" says BB. \"Holding the reins of a mule pulling a hoe through them cotton fields.\" The field holler, he explains, was a lament sung on a minor scale by a single voice. It also functioned as a communication to alert others in the field that the boss was coming, or that water was needed. \"Yeah, the holler is where it all started. I think it's in all of us.\"</p> <p>Riley B King was born on 16 September 1925, great-grandson of a slave. He moved soon after with his mother to Kilmichael, in Hill Country, to work as a farmhand and listen to his aunt's Blind Lemon Jefferson records. His uncle, the great bluesman Bukka White, would visit from Memphis \u2013 play and sing.</p> <p>First BB's mother died, then the grandmother in whose care he had been placed. \"The blues,\" he would later write, \"was bleeding the same blood as me.\" Picking cotton for 75 cents a day, BB had coveted the local preacher's guitar and was even allowed to \"play a few chords he taught me\". He then made his own, he says: \"We used to make it with wire, the kind you use to make a cotton bail, and tie it to a broom handle. Clamp it down, the sound changed, and I'm playin' music.\" Later, his employer, a white man called Flake Cartledge, advanced him the $15 he needed for a real one.</p> <p>There followed an unhappy period with his father's family way south in Lexington. There, BB witnessed the lynching and castration of a young black man by a white mob \u2013 his crime had been to wolf-whistle at a white girl. Riley King fled Lexington, and his father's new family, cycling alone \"like a bat out of hell, never to return\", back to Itta Bena.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-396733137\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/26/1348672973303/BB-King-clip-2-001.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/9/26/120926BBKingClip2-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/9/26/120926BBKingClip2-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/9/26/120926BBKingClip2_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120926BBKingClip2/120926BBKingClip2.m3u8\"/> </video>   <p>Nine-year-old Riley King was now back in the Delta, where he worked the fields. picking \"Delta Pinelet\".\"Cotton was a force of nature. There's a poetry to it, hoeing and growing cotton,\" he later wrote. Under the pecan tree, he adds: \"Though it didn't make none of my people rich. I figured out that I must have walked around the world, all those hours and days and weeks behind a mule.\" His biographer Charles Sawyer once asked King: \"How can you play in 90-degree heat in a 3-piece suit?\" To which BB replied: \"I used to work all day in the hot sun in Mississippi.\" Sawyer shook his head and said he would pass out if I tried to play under all those layers of fabric. BB replied: \"Well, Charlie, you're white\".</p> <p>On Saturday nights, workers left the fields for town. \"I was peeping through the slats at a place I'm playing later tonight they call Club Ebony,\" recalls BB, \"to hear Count Basie play, Charlie Parker, too \u2013 and see all those beautiful women in tight dresses jivin' away.\" Young Riley King sang gospel on the street corners of this town, and learned soon that \"the church folks that liked my singing didn't slip me a dime much as the other folks did when I changed sidewalks to the other side of town and changed praising the Lord to praising a lady\", which is another cornerstone of the blues King learned early: it is not just the words of a song, it the mood that matters, convoyed by the larynx, as instrument. That is what defined and defines BB's extraordinary voice. Then there is the instrument itself, the guitar.</p> <p>Several adventures later, BB fulfilled his dream of reaching Memphis to play. He recalls a crucial moment in the history of the guitar style which became his and his alone \u2013 the vibrato that is instantly recognisable as BB King's after only a single note. He was staying with Bukka White, and \"Bukka used to play slide using a bottleneck, or just a piece of pipe. I wanted to do that, and I tried and he showed me how \u2013 but I got stupid fingers, see, and I just couldn't do it.\" However: \"The sound Bukka made went all through me, and I devised my own technique for producing the tremolo without the slide.\" He calls it \"the butterfly. I swivel my wrist from my elbow, back and forth, and this stretches the string, raising and lowering the pitch of the note rhythmically. With my other fingers stretched out, my whole hand makes a fluttering gesture, a bit like a butterfly flapping its wings.\"</p> <p>Thus the BB King sound was born \u2013 a sound that expresses mood, feeling, blue or otherwise. In Brewer's film, there is a montage in which most of the great guitarists of their generation acknowledge it, and the ability to recognise it. King himself says it another way: \"I tried to connect my singing voice to my guitar an' my guitar to my singing voice. Like the two was talking to one another.\" Jon Brewer confirms a detail which explains the dialogue between voice and guitar differently: \"BB's secret is that he can't sing and play at the same time.\"</p> <p>BB King called his guitar Lucille after someone else's fight in a juke joint knocked over a container of kerosene that was the heating system. The place caught fire, the crowd fled, but BB realised he had left his guitar inside and ran to get it. Chastised for his recklessness, he discovered that the fight had been over a girl called Lucille. \"I named my guitar Lucille,\" he says in <em>The Life of Riley</em>, \"to remind myself not to do something like that again, and I haven't.\"</p> <p>The blues went north, with the great migration from the mechanised cotton fields, in pursuit of work in the big cities. For the most part they accompanied the majority of the black exodus to the burgeoning megalopolis of Chicago. Each musician from what became the golden age of the blues mutated the Delta sound to form their own style \u2013 Elmore James, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf \u2013 within that Windy City electric sound. But BB King chose a different scene, on Beale Street in Memphis, closer to home up the Mississippi reaches. He came to forge a more rounded, less feral timbre than Muddy or the Wolf, with a bigger band including brass and rhythm sections.</p> <p>Blues Boy King \u2013 shortened to BB \u2013 became a radio star at WDIA, the blues station in Memphis. He built his band, he ensured that he tour on a bus, he made lifelong friends, he left his first wife and indulged his love of women \u2013 and released his first hit, \"Three O'Clock Blues\".</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-396733153\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/26/1348672753953/BB-King-clip-3-015.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/9/26/120926BBKingClip3-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/9/26/120926BBKingClip3-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/9/26/120926BBKingClip3_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120926BBKingClip3/120926BBKingClip3.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/9/26/120926BBKingClip3_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video>   <p>In <em>The Life of Riley</em>, Calvin Owens \u2013 trumpeter in the original BB King band \u2013 recalls those days on what was called the segregated Chitlin' Circuit, named after animal offal that black people were said to enjoy eating, but not whites \u2013 \"Though I never called it any Chitlin' Circuit,\" says BB King. \"The road,\" says Owens, \"is home\", and it remained BB's home for the rest of his life. Sometimes he did 350 performances a year \u2013 \"I like my job,\" he says, under the pecan tree. BB King married a second time, to Sue Carol Hill, daughter of the owner of the Club Ebony \u2013 founded in 1907 \u2013 where BB used to peep and later play. Their marriage, while it lasted, was lived on the road. Staying, of course, in segregated black hotels, eating at segregated black restaurants.</p> <p>\"I've put up with more humiliation than I care to remember,\" King wrote in his autobiography <em>Blues All Around Me</em>. \"Touring a segregated America \u2013 forever being stopped and harassed by white cops hurt you most cos you don't realise the damage. You hold it in. You feel empty, like someone reached in and pulled out your guts. You feel hurt and dirty, less than a person.\" There was one night at the Gaston Hotel in Birmingham, Alabama, where BB King was staying at the same time as Dr Martin Luther King, when \"they bombed the place. The bomb rocked my room.\" Now BB King is back to be honoured in the city where the White Citizens' Council was formed.</p> <p>Last time I was in this area, around Clarksdale, it was to report on poverty \u2013 and in Mississippi, that means black poverty. It was the year of the election between Al Gore and George W Bush, and I sat with old Ruby Walker on her porch with most of her 22 cats frolicking around her. The next few days would be particularly hard for the Walker family, since they were to have marked the 19th birthday of Ruby's granddaughter, Sandra Handy. However, there was a different anniversary: \"She was just crossing the railroad line on her way home this time last year when the shooting started and a bullet hit her right in the head.\" There is a macabre intimacy to the murder. Ruby gestured towards the house behind her, and folks hanging out their washing to dry in the muggy heat: \"It was their boy done the shooting. He only got 10 years and it's hard to look at them every day.\" He was, she adds, \"one of the gangbangers \u2013 fighting for territory\".</p> <p>Like BB King's, Ruby's great-grandparents were slaves working these cotton fields. \"And so was I, after a fashion,\" she reflected. \"We worked from sun-up to sundown, and the money was cheap.\" Her daughter Mary became the fifth cotton-picking generation until she found work in a local school. But, added Ruby, the furrows deepening across her brow: \"I sometimes wonder if they ever really did do away with slavery. I don't know what's happening round here no more. All I know is it was better in the 40s than it is now.\"</p> <p>That same visit I met a relative of the Fair family, who shared a plot with young BB King, and who \u2013 in Brewer's film \u2013 recalls him as a boy cycling home from Lexington. Shirley Fair was the owner of a flower store in Clarksdale called Ooh So Pretty Flowers, where a meeting was arranged with President Bill Clinton when he blew through on his Poverty Tour of 1999. But, said Mrs Fair, \"nothing has gotten any better. There's nothing here to grasp on to. The railroad is closed, the factories have gone. The good folks move on and the gangbangers take over the streets, and that makes it harder for businesses to survive. The president wrote me a letter saying I could apply for a grant and employ 10 people. But there were so many rules and regulations I couldn't understand nothing. Always something to slow you and stop you. So I did stop.\"</p> <p>Nights round here are different when BB King is not in town. Down at the Club Sugar in Jonestown \u2013 a ramshackle brick cabin beside the railroad track \u2013 lads like Q, with his blue bandana, are arriving to drown their sorrows and thoughts in the barrage of rap music while his friend Icy Man, although in the middle of a conversation, pulls hard on a tube of \"rocks\", his eyes glazing over, his face frozen in oblivion. It's like finding the old 70s Bronx in the middle of a 21st-century cotton plantation, and the crowd soon moves to a joint nearer the village centre, Hot Spot. We ask if we can take pictures of the heaving and dancing, to be told politely that this would be a \"bad idea because a lot of the guys here are wanted. They're serious.\" Our host, a man called Clee, who dislikes rap and who dreams mainly of setting up a blues band in town, adds: \"They're not local, they're County.\"</p> <p>BB King knows all this. And he is not as self-satisfied as one might expect him to be with \"progress\" since the bad old days. For sure he jammed at the White House with a black president, and there's a BB King Day in the Mississippi calendar \u2013 but also the confederate ensign is its state flag. \"We've come a long, long way,\" says BB King, \"but we ain't come far enough. There's still a long, long way to go.\" I ask if he is aware of his own role in that \"long, long way\" since he saw a man lynched and shared a bombed-out motel with Martin Luther King. \"I'd like to think I made a lil' footprint in the sand,\" he replies, and puts his arm around a young boy next to us, on his right. \"This here little boy's the same age as me when I was holding the reins of a mule. He won't never know those times, but I wonder what this boy will grow up to do. I wonder\u2026\"</p> <p>However: \"The racists couldn't legislate musical taste,\" writes BB. The influence of BB King and the blues over great white musicians from the generation that followed him is a slice from one of the most compelling stories in 20th-century music and culture: how white hipsters, many of them British, seized on the Delta and Chicago blues, bringing those who sang them before a vast white \u2013 and ultimately global \u2013 audience, to the amazement of the elderly bluesmen themselves.</p> <p>There is a wonderful moment in <em>The Life of Riley</em> concerning a gig BB King was playing in Chicago at which four white people arrived. \"One of them was extra white,\" recalls BB, referring to the albino Johnny Winter, a master blues guitarist with long straight hair and pencil-thin tattooed arms. BB was afraid they were from the IRS tax authorities, a perennial bane of his life. Winter asked if he could \"sit in on a number\", and the master was clearly ambivalent. But: \"He was good. I tell you, he was good.\"</p> <p>By the time BB King recorded perhaps his greatest album, <em>Live at the Regal</em>, in 1964, mainstream America and much of black America had forgotten about the blues in favour of rock'n'roll and embryonic soul. But the hipsters remained true. John Mayall nurtured a stable that included Eric Clapton, Peter Green and Mick Taylor later of Cream, Fleetwood Mac and the Rolling Stones \u2013 and lesser-known names propelled the British blues explosion: Chicken Shack, Savoy Brown, Wishbone Ash, Keef Hartley \u2026</p> <p>Jon Brewer recalls the moment: \"You had these new bands playing bingo halls and Meccas, supporting Cliff Richard or Engelbert Humperdink or whoever, and wondering: 'Which way do we go?' And they found this really good stuff played by black musicians that was far superior to what we had here. So you had people like John Mayall and Peter Green thinking: 'This is the real thing.'\"</p> <p>(My own interest was deep and irrevocable from the night that Son House, Bukka White, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee arrived to play at Hammersmith Odeon in 1967. I was compelled, edge-of-seat, and hooked for life. When the white bluesmen went to America, recalls Keith Richards in Brewer's film: \"They wanted to know what we were doing and why we were doing it.\")</p> <p>\"I can tell BB from one note,\" says Eric Clapton, in Brewer's film. \"Most of us can.\" He has, says Clapton, \"a certain melodic sense unique to himself.\"</p> <p>Bill Wyman recalls BB King's tremolo when the two came to record together in 1971: \"He showed me how to do it \u2013 buggered if I could.\"</p> <p>There is an extraordinary sequence in the film where BB describes his arrival at Bill Graham's Fillmore West in San Francisco, when queues of white hippies were in the street. At first BB thinks he is in the wrong place but confesses that he was so moved by several standing ovations he \"cried back up the stairway\". In our interview under the pecan tree, King calls it \"my breakthrough moment. It was an unusual situation. You had all these people playing the blues: Mike Bloomfield and Elvin Bishop were good, Clapton was good, Johnny Winter was good, Peter Green was good.\" And he leans forward as if to impart some secret: \"They had something. They introduced us to a whole new world. And we learned a lot from people like Clapton and Peter Green. I ain't gonna tell you what it is,\" he says in a whisper, \"but we learned something. They did something for the blues.\"</p> <p>BB King once wrote, when discussing his technique, that \"Lucille was singing the blues better than me.\" But now he says something intriguingly different: \"You've heard me call myself a bluesman and a blues singer,\" he says. \"I call myself a blues singer, but you ain't never heard me call myself a blues guitar man. Well, that's because there's been so many can do it better'n I can, play the blues better'n me. I think a lot of them have told me things, taught me things. But they just ain't me, that's all. They're not BB King.\" It's a remark that emphasises the primacy of BB King's voice, that all-expressive rasp, that howl of desire or of pain.</p> <p>I've had BB King to myself for 25 minutes now, surrounded by people who've known him for decades. Old friends and family plus young fans come to behold him for the first time, and it feels like a levee is about to break \u2013 not to unleash the Mississippi backwaters, but this throng of good people.</p> <p>BB King ends our interview with an observation that hallmarks true greatness. In the film he had said: \"When I hear what I want to hear, I'd have to stop.\" Now he elaborates: \"I think I've done the best I could have done. But I keep wanting to play better, go further. There are so many sounds I still want to make, so many things I haven't yet done. When I was younger I thought maybe I'd reached that peak. But I'm 86 now, and if I make it through to next month, I'll be 87. And now I know it can never be perfect, it can never be exactly what it should be, so you got to keep going further, getting better.\"</p> <p>On the subject of women, BB King's book is markedly \u2013 almost disarmingly \u2013 candid. And he says now: \"I never met a woman I didn't like. I love 'em all, in their different ways\" \u2013 and sure enough, just then a lady demands his attention.</p> <p>\"You know,\" he muses in my direction, \"if I find myself a nice wife who'll give me a chance, I may just come back to Indianola!\"</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-396732999\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/26/1348672624178/BB-King-trailer-001.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/9/26/120926BBKingTrailer-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/9/26/120926BBKingTrailer-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/9/26/120926BBKingTrailer_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120926BBKingTrailer/120926BBKingTrailer.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/9/26/120926BBKingTrailer_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/> </video>   <p>He turns to the lady in her splendidly coloured dress: \"Are you married?</p> <p>\"No sir,\" she replies.</p> <p>\"You shouldn't be telling me that kinda thing,\" confides BB. <em> </em></p> <p>When BB King leaves the stage in the park next to his museum in Indianola, the night is just beginning. Not only for this part of town, on very much the wrong side of those railway tracks \u2013 where blues juke joints and rural slums are huddled against one another and hopping to life \u2013 but for the 86-year-old also.</p> <p>Two hours after bidding farewell, BB is due to take the stage again at what is one of the most historically charged venues in America, that same Club Ebony, founded in 1907, where as a boy Riley B King would peep through the slats wide-eyed at the \"jitterbugging, snake-hipping and trucking\", as he describes it.</p> <p>Around 11pm BB King appears onstage, much of his audience one over the eight, talkative but mellow, ready for what is (in my book at least) the experience of a lifetime. The blues master who has played to stadia and venues across the world settles on his chair as if in his own living room, which in a way this is. There's a power problem: \"Guess I didn't pay my bill on time,\" he chuckles.</p> <p>Then he picks up Lucille and plays those notes \u2013 long notes, impossibly stretched, at moments crashing into some zone Hendrix might have navigated. Perhaps oddly, King indulges in less eye contact with the juke-joint tables across which the beers and liquor flow than he did his outdoor audience. He greets them, and banters of course: \"Well, sweet ol' Indianola!\" \u2013 but is in a world of his own now, less the showman than the musician listening hard to his own alchemy.</p> <p>Outside in the sauna of night, poor young men in gangland attire gather to watch those with tickets a-coming and going; there's a buzz around the big event, never mind at it \u2013 drugs for sale, police bundling someone into a van, guards patrolling the visitors' parked cars and lads eyeing them up.</p> <p>BB swings through his all-time greats now. The air fills with whisky fumes and a surprising level of chatter, and there are curses exchanged with a redneck family, one of whom is blind drunk, unsteady on his feet, blocking people's views and trying to steal an elderly man's fedora hat. For \"Every Day I Have The Blues\", BB's voice is like that instrument again, at once guttural but velvet, while he apparently sings with his guitar, Lucille talking back to the singer. There's a rendition of \"See That My Grave Is Kept Clean\" \u2013 that great blues anthem about the imminence of death that makes the blood run cold: it has a chunky-rolling feel to it, pierced by the searing defiance of King's guitar, and the nearest he gets to a field holler tonight even if it's on Lucille. \"Not bad for an 86-year-old,\" he says, signing off the night that has now become early morning in cotton country.</p> <p>The Life of Riley<em> is out on 15 October</em></p>",
  "<p>Most players swap shirts at full-time but Sergio Ramos and Mesut Ozil swapped theirs 45 minutes earlier. In a tense Bernab\u00e9u dressing room last Sunday, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho decided to make a change and words were exchanged. Although Real Madrid were 3-1 up against Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a, Mourinho was not particularly pleased with what he had seen. Ozil was taken off and Kak\u00e1 was sent on for the second half. Sitting not far from Ozil was Ramos. When the German took his shirt off, Ramos put it on underneath his own.</p> <p>No one would have noticed had it not been for a photographer from <em>Marca</em>. Just about visible on Ramos's back, peering through his own shirt was: Ozil, 10. It was meant as a gesture of support but, given the context, you could be forgiven for seeing it as an act of subversion. Here was a challenge to his manager \u2013 and a very public one, too.</p> <p>Called by the club's president, Florentino P\u00e9rez, Ramos was swift to explain the gesture on Twitter. Ozil, he explained, is a good friend. He had long since promised the German that he would dedicate to him his first goal of the season and he had a feeling the goal was going to come so, taking advantage of Ozil's substitution, he chose to put his shirt on, ready to reveal it when he scored. He was fortunate that he did not; the fallout from a gesture made before 80,000 fans and in front of his coach would have been nuclear. It was pretty damaging anyway. Ramos, one of the club's captains, had chosen to show his support for Ozil \u2013 the man, with him, most singled out by Mourinho since results turned against the side. His explanation convinced few. You could almost hear him squirming. This was another glimpse of internal relations and it did not make happy viewing.</p> <p>On the eve of Madrid's Champions League match with Ajax, there were few questions about the game, while there were a dozen about Ramos, Ozil and relations. The story moved from the pitch to the dressing room. For Mourinho and some supporters that said more about the media than their manager: many see a vicious press campaign against the coach. He has not played the Spanish game and he has not succeeded in getting them to play his game either, unable to charm or control the media as he did elsewhere.</p> <p>Everything that happens at Madrid is magnified; the pressure is intense. It is a political club managed by a political coach and reported on by a political media. Mistrust is inevitable, normality far from easy. People see agendas, some genuine, some imagined. It conditions the atmosphere but the flashpoints and tension have been real. Relations are strained between coach and captain. A Spanish dressing room is harder to manage than an English one. Players who have won the World Cup playing a different way under a different manager and alongside players from the other side of the club divide are not so easily coaxed.</p> <p>During pre-season Mourinho complained at the way his players had spent their summers. Madrid drew with Valencia and lost at Getafe. A set play was their undoing. \"We can't work on them any more than we do,\" Mourinho said, shifting the blame to his players. Some of them did not appreciate being blamed, nor that Mourinho washed his own hands of responsibility. Madrid then beat Granada. Cristiano Ronaldo scored that day but did not celebrate: he said that the reason was that he was \"sad \u2026 and the club know why\".</p> <p>When Madrid were beaten in Sevilla, leaving them eight points behind Barcelona after five weeks, Mourinho said too many of his players were not focused on football. At half-time he hauled off Angel Di Mar\u00eda, who was treading a fine line with the referee, and Ozil. \"I made two changes at half-time,\" he said, \"but I could have made seven.\" Then he delivered the most devastating of conclusions: \"Right now I don't have a team.\" That message was not digested well by his squad and the impact was greater still. For the following game, against Manchester City, Ramos was left out. Mourinho called it a technical decision. Others saw it as a punishment and of the wrong man: it was Di Mar\u00eda, not Ramos, who was at fault for the goal. What many observers did not see at first was that Ozil had been left out too, such was the focus on the centre-back. And at about the same time, the rumours appeared. Ozil was forced to deny he was living the high life. At half-time against Deportivo, Ozil, who had been given a first start since Sevilla, was singled out again. Mourinho emerged from the tunnel and sat on the bench a few minutes before his team came out for the second half, wearing a serious expression and leaving them in the dressing room. Meanwhile, Ramos was pulling on Ozil's shirt. A photo appeared and suddenly every detail was pored over, right down to the order the players boarded the team bus \u2013 Spaniards at the back, Portuguese at the front.</p> <p>But Madrid won 6-1 against Deportivo. Last season there were confrontations after Real Madrid drew in Santander early in the campaign. When the season came to an end, Madrid had racked up a record 100 points. It can often feel like Madrid are only a couple of bad results from an explosion but it is rare that they string together two bad results in a row. \"If Ronaldo's sad and he keeps scoring goals, fine,\" Mourinho said. He even noted that Ramos had played well \u2013 since he had left him out.</p> <p>Much is made of unity creating good results but it can work the other way round. Sometimes it is the good results that bring unity. For Madrid, few results expose flaws like losing to Barcelona; few hide them like beating Barcelona.</p>",
  "<p>An outbreak of meningitis linked to contaminated steroid shots prepared by a Massachusetts pharmacy has now resulted in seven deaths, officials said Saturday as they confirmed that the illness had spread to more states.</p> <p>The total number of cases of the rare form of fungal meningitis is now 64, with Minnesota and Ohio added to the list of states affected.</p> <p>Since the outbreak was traced to products sent out by an unaccredited pharmaceutical compounding company with a history of health violations, medical clinics across the eastern USA have been making contact with patients given the injection.</p> <p>In the past 24 hours, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has added two people to the number of fatalities. The total number of cases has jumped by 17 from Friday's figure of 47.</p> <p>The updated figures comes amid growing concern over why clinics from as far away as Florida and Tennessee chose to buy in bulk from a pharmacy that had not applied for accreditation form a professional body and had a checkered health and safety record.</p> <p>The outbreak has been traced to the New England Compounding Center, which from premises in Framingham, Massachusetts sent out as many as 17,000 doses of contaminated steroid injections.</p> <p>Investigators from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) who were sent to the company found a fungal contaminate in a sealed vial of the steroid methylprednisolone acetate. They also found a \"foreign material\" in another, opened container. Tests are being conducted to determine if the contaminants match the one that has led to recent cases of meningitis.</p> <p>The Guardian has made repeated calls to the homes of the owner of New England Compounding Center and its president. All have gone unanswered. The company's website had been taken down.</p> <p>A history of failings at the company has emerged, with complaints having reportedly been made against it as long ago as 2002 and as recently as this year. A 2006 warning letter from the FDA to company owner Barry Cadden cited a string of health and safety violations, including the misbranding of drugs and the copying of FDA-approved, commercially available products.</p> <p>Investigators expressed special concern over the company's practice of splitting up an injectable drug, Avastin, into multiple doses to be sold on. Such a practice could lead to \"potential microbial contamination\", the letter stated.</p> <p>The FDA also noted that Avastin is approved only for use in treatment of colorectal cancers. New England Compounding Center was marketing the drug to ophthalmologists, despite it having \"no approved indications for use in the eye\".</p> <p>\"Your firm is distributing an unapproved new drug,\" Mr Cadden was warned.</p> <p>Compounding pharmacists have long been on the radar of federal regulators. In a 2007 document, the FDA said it was scrutinising the industry \"mainly because of instances where compounded drugs have endangered public health\".</p> <p>Pharmacists have long mixed or altered ingredients to tailor to the needs of individual patients.</p> <p>\"In its traditional form, pharmacy compounding is a vital service that helps many people, including those who are allergic to inactive ingredients in FDA-approved medicines, and others who need medications that are not available commercially,\" Kathleen Anderson, the then-deputy director of the FDA's division of new drugs and labelling compliance, stated in the 2007 public-health information document.</p> <p>However, the compounds produced are not FDA-approved and poor practice can lead to contamination.</p> <p>In March 2006, three patients died due to contaminated solutions used to paralyse the heart during open-heart surgery. In 2005, at the Veterans Affairs hospital in Washington DC, two people were blinded by bacteria in a batch of drugs used during cataract operations. Last year, nine patients at hospitals in Alabama died after receiving intravenous nutritional supplements that were infected with a lethal bacteria. The supplements had been prepared by a pharmacy compounder in Birmingham.</p> <p>Defenders of the practice have suggested that rogue operators are to blame and that regulators and the clinics affected could also be at fault.</p> <p>David Miller, executive vice president and CEO of the International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists, said the New England Compounding Center was not accredited, and had been guilty of past health violations. He also said that the quantity of doses prepared by the company seemed to put it at odds with the industry at large</p> <p>\"There were more than 17,000 doses put together by the pharmacy,\" he said. \"How is it possible they had 17,000 individual doses \u2013 it looks like there were working with the drug manufacturers. If that was how it was being done, that is in contrast to traditional compounding.\"</p> <p>Miller added: \"It doesn't make sense, we do not know why there are buying from this pharmacist \u2013 was it price? What due-diligence did the clinics do to make sure it was licensed and accredited \u2013 which it was not.\"</p> <p>Only one of the clinics affected in the outbreak returned Guardian phone calls made to enquire why they bought drugs from compounders, rather than from bigger pharmaceutical companies.</p> <p>A representative of Greenspring Surgery Centre in Maryland \u2013 which is contacting patients it knows to have been given steroids from the Massacusetts firm \u2013 said it bought from compounders \"because sometimes there are formulations of medications that are unavailable commercially. This is a commercial product. But whether you buy it from a large or a small company, they all have the same standards that have to be met.\"</p> <p>Asked if there was a cost consideration the spokesman, who declined to be identified, said: \"Sometimes there is, sometimes there isn't. In this case there wasn't, it was actually an availability issue and an issue of having the right medication, the right dosage.</p> <p>\"There has a scarcity of multiple medications over the last couple of years and that has created a need to reach out to multiple suppliers.\"</p> <p>The comment seems to contradict the view of International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists, which represents more than 2,700 compounding pharmacists across the US.</p> <p>Miller told the Guardian: \"In all the states affected there are compounders who could have provided the drug.\"</p>",
  "<p>More than 50 victims of phone hacking, including a number of top celebrities, <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/politics/2012/oct/06/open-letter-david-cameron-hacking\" title=\"\">have written to David Cameron</a> expressing fury at suggestions that the coalition government could reject tough new laws that would see the press policed by an independent regulator.</p> <p>In a move designed to send the issue to the top of the agenda at the Tory conference, they warn the prime minister that trust in the media cannot be restored if the press is allowed to continue with a system of self-regulation.</p> <p>Celebrities including Hugh Grant, Jude Law and Charlotte Church, as well as 7/7 victims and members of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, have signed an open letter expressing alarm at reports that Cameron intends to reject any form of statutory regulation of the press if such a recommendation is made by the Leveson inquiry.</p> <p>The judge-led inquiry into the role and governance of the media was established by the prime minister in July last year in response to the phone-hacking scandal at the now defunct <em>News of the World</em> newspaper. Having spent more than a year collecting evidence, the inquiry is considering a range of recommendations that may include a proposal for the press to be subject to an independent regulator backed by law and with significant new powers.</p> <p>But the Hacked Off campaign, which represents victims of hacking and other forms of newspaper intrusion, and has issued the open letter, said it had become \"alarmed and distressed\" by reports that Cameron had decided to give news-papers \"another chance to improve self-regulation\".</p> <p>Sources close to the prime minister have been quoted as saying he \"is likely to reject statutory intervention in regulation of the press, even if it is recommended by Lord Justice Leveson\".</p> <p>When asked to comment last month, the prime minister's spokesman said only that the stories were \"speculation\". However, Hacked Off warns that any rejection of the inquiry's potential recommendations before they have been submitted to government would be \"a betrayal of us and your previous commitments\".</p> <p>When he established the Leveson inquiry, Cameron pledged that the test for the future system of press regulation was not whether it suited politicians or the press but \"people who have been caught up and absolutely thrown to the wolves by this process\".</p> <p>Hacked Off said it had also been concerned by comments made by Tory ministers. Appearing before the inquiry, the education secretary, Michael Gove, argued against the statutory regulation of the press and urged Leveson to \"consider carefully\" his proposals. Theresa May, home secretary, has given a warning on possible \"unintended consequences\" if self-regulation were scrapped.</p> <p>Such a move would spark fury among some of the largest newspaper groups and prompt claims that the press was in danger of being muzzled. But a failure to be seen to act after a long-running and costly inquiry that he established would expose Cameron to claims that he was in thrall to powerful interests, notably Rupert Murdoch.</p> <p>An alternative way forward, advanced by Lord Black, the chairman of the Press Standards Board of Finance, would be for a new self-regulatory press body that had the power to launch investigations and levy fines of up to \u00a31m.</p> <p>But Hacked Off said victims believed that any proposal that did not have a \"statutory backstop\" was inadequate. It said that it was seeking reassurances from the prime minister that he had an \"open mind\" on the matter and had \"not already decided in favour of a proposal for continued self-regulation which we believe to be unsatisfactory\".</p> <p>The letter concludes: \"We look forward to hearing from you as a matter of urgency so that our minds can be put at rest and so that the public in general may know that your position on this vital matter has not changed.\"</p> <p>Professor Brian Cathcart, director of Hacked Off, said it was crucial that the inquiry's recommendations were not prejudged. \"The victims of press abuse who signed this letter are alarmed that, before Lord Justice Leveson has even had the chance to report, it is reported that his proposals will be rejected,\" Cathcart said.</p> <p>\"It is hard to believe that the prime minister, who, after all, set up the inquiry, could really have taken such a decision. The judge has spent a year investigating press culture, ethics and practices; his recommendations, when published, surely deserve to be considered with open minds and with the greatest seriousness.\"</p> <p>Dominic Crossley, who represented the families of Milly Dowler, and Madeleine McCann at the inquiry, said that it must be kept free from politics. \"If Leveson's recommendations, whatever they may be, are ignored or diminished for purely political reasons, in face of what we heard of the relationship between the press and politicians, it would truly be scandalous,\" Crossley said. The Dowler family is not a signatory to the letter.</p> <p>Church and Jacqui Hames, the former Metropolitan police officer who was targeted by private investigators working for the <em>News of the World</em>, will discuss their concerns with Cameron on Tuesday at the Tory party conference.</p> <p>\"We await Lord Leveson's independent report, the content of which is a matter for him,\" a Downing Street spokesman said.</p> <p> \u2022 <em>This article was amended on Sunday 7 October to clarify that the Dowler family was not a signatory to the letter to David Cameron</em></p>",
  "<p>Dear Prime Minister,</p> <p>We are individual victims of the unlawful and unethical conduct of the press in recent years. This conduct has included phone hacking, industrial scale data-mining, bribery of public officials, inappropriate contact with politicians, computer hacking, unlawful invasions of privacy, blackmail threats and harassment. It has also involved a shameful conspiracy to cover up many of these misdeeds. No public interest justification has ever been credibly advanced for these abuses.</p> <p>When you set up the Leveson inquiry, we welcomed your action. The government appeared to be taking seriously the unchecked abuse of ordinary people by parts of the press. It also appeared genuinely to be concerned about the damage done to public trust in politicians and the police and indeed in the important role in a democratic society played by ethical public interest journalism.</p> <p>We accepted at face value your expression of regret at what had happened, both under your watch and that of previous governments. We understood that your experience of learning of the allegations against your former Head of Communications had underlined your determination to make sure that action was finally being taken to make sure that our free press, our police force and the political establishment put their house in order.</p> <p>We also welcomed your remarks, made in the House of Commons, that \"We will never solve this if we try to do it on a party basis; we must try to do it on a cross-party basis,\" and that \"We must at all times keep the real victims at the front and centre of this debate.\" (Hansard 13 July 2011: column 320).</p> <p>We were further reassured by what you said about us when you gave evidence at the inquiry: \"I've read some of the evidence that's been put forward, and frankly some of that evidence is incredibly shocking. Some of it is really heartbreaking. The test of a regulatory system is not does that make the politicians happier? The test of the system is: is it going to provide proper protection to ordinary families who, through no fault of their own, get caught up in these media maelstroms and get completely mistreated?</p> <p>\"The evidence of the Dowler family and the evidence of the McCann family is incredibly powerful in that regard. I will never forget meeting with the Dowler family in Downing Street to run through the terms of this inquiry with them and to hear what they had been through and how it had redoubled, trebled the pain and agony they'd been through over losing Milly.</p> <p>\"I'll never forget that, and that's the test of all this. It's not: do the politicians or the press feel happy with what we get? It's: are we really protecting people who have been caught up and absolutely thrown to the wolves by this process. That's what the test is.\" (Official Transcript, 14 June 2011, page 57-8)</p> <p>When it comes to this \"test\", you will be aware that the victims, after reflecting on the evidence put before the inquiry in all its modules, made a submission which gives our view on the proposal for continued self-regulation put forward on behalf of some in the press by Lord Hunt and Lord Black (the 'Hunt/Black' plan). As stated in <a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Joint-Submission-by-Core-Participant-Victims1.pdf\" title=\"\">this submission (pdf)</a>, we do not believe these proposals are satisfactory in themselves, that they meet the needs of the victims, or that they will restore public trust. The submission states:</p> <p>\"The Module 4 CPVs have considered the submissions and evidence of Lord Hunt and Lord Black [to improve self-regulation]. The Module 4 CPVs all agree that the proposal advocated by Lord(s) Hunt and Black for a new contractual self-regulatory body would not be a satisfactory solution. The proposal is considered to be an insufficiently clean break from the current PCC and the failings associated with that organisation. In the event that this system was established, it is anticipated by the Module 4 CPVs that complainants would be likely to prefer court proceedings as a forum for seeking redress.\"</p> <p>We have therefore been alarmed and distressed by the widespread reports in the press (The Times, 31 August 2012), supported by comments made by senior members of your party, that you have already made up your mind and that you were \"preparing to reject statutory intervention in the regulation of the press, even if it is strongly recommended by Lord Justice Leveson\"; and that the \"newspaper industry will be given another chance to improve self-regulation\".</p> <p>We were also frustrated to see that your own Head of Communications, asked to reject the assertions in these stories, refused to do so, stating only that the reports were \"speculation\". In the absence of rebuttal from you or your office, it is noteworthy that the Times (5 September 2012) felt able to repeat the story the following week, stating: \"David Cameron is likely to reject statutory intervention in regulation of the press even if it is recommended by Lord Justice Leveson.\"</p> <p>After we reminded the press and your office that the victims rejected continued self-regulation of the press with no statutory back-stop, and of what you had said in July under oath at the inquiry (\"\u2026the test of all this. It's not: do the politicians or the press feel happy with what we get? It's: are we really protecting people who have been caught up and absolutely thrown to the wolves by this process. That's what the test is\"). The Times reported (5 September 2012) that \"a well-placed source said Mr Cameron's words had been misinterpreted and he had not intended to give a veto to any particular victims over the new system of regulation\".</p> <p>It is highly regrettable to us that these articles, and supporting comments from senior Conservative party figures, have sought to undermine the work of the inquiry and to threaten any recommendations it may make for effective regulation of the industry. We are disappointed that you have so far not contradicted these articles, and therefore give the impression that you have, indeed, already decided to reject the recommendations of the inquiry which you set up, even before they are even submitted. We, the victims, would consider such a rejection to be a betrayal of us and of your previous commitments.</p> <p>We therefore seek your reassurance that:</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Contrary to the reports which we refer to above, you will consider the recommendations of Lord Justice Leveson with an open mind;</p> <p><strong>2</strong> You have not already decided in favour of a proposal for continued self-regulation \u2013 which we believe to be unsatisfactory;</p> <p><strong>3</strong> You will proceed on a cross-party basis;</p> <p><strong>4</strong> That you stand by what you said at the inquiry.</p> <p>To remind you once again: you said that the test of the future system of press regulation is not whether it suits the politicians or their friends in the press, but rather the public interest \u2013 including the need of members of society to be free from illegal and unethical press practices. Do we have those reassurances?</p> <p>We look forward to hearing from you as a matter of urgency so that our minds can be put at rest and so that the public in general may know that your position on this vital matter has not changed.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,</p> <p><strong>Charlotte Church</strong></p> <p><strong>Jacqui Hames</strong></p> <p><strong>James and Margaret Watson</strong></p> <p><strong>Christopher Jefferies</strong></p> <p><strong>Mark Covell</strong></p> <p><strong>Paul Dadge</strong></p> <p><strong>JK Rowling</strong></p> <p><strong>Prof John Tulloch</strong></p> <p><strong>Ian Hurst</strong></p> <p><strong>Jane Winter</strong></p> <p><strong>Joan Hammell</strong></p> <p><strong>Mary-Ellen Field</strong></p> <p><strong>HKJ</strong> (friend of politician who gave evidence anonymously)</p> <p><strong>John Anderson</strong> </p> <p><strong>Joan Smith</strong></p> <p><strong>Ben Jackson</strong></p> <p><strong>Graham Shear</strong></p> <p><strong>David Archer</strong></p> <p><strong>Trevor Akester</strong></p> <p><strong>Tom Rowland</strong></p> <p><strong>Mark Thomson</strong></p> <p><strong>Brian Paddick</strong></p> <p><strong>Father Richard Reardon</strong></p> <p><strong>Michelle Milburn</strong></p> <p><strong>Zoe Margolis</strong></p> <p><strong>Patricia Bernal</strong></p> <p><strong>Tricia Cooklin</strong></p> <p><strong>Sally King</strong></p> <p><strong>Andrew King</strong></p> <p><strong>Louise Glass</strong></p> <p><strong>Adam Lancelot</strong></p> <p><strong>Denise Anderson</strong></p> <p><strong>Stephen Toze</strong></p> <p><strong>Anne Lee</strong></p> <p><strong>Amanda Ramsey</strong></p> <p><strong>Major Mark Cann</strong></p> <p><strong>Lissa Gibbons</strong></p> <p><strong>Jennifer Evans</strong></p> <p><strong>Charlotte Harris</strong></p> <p><strong>Noel Whelan</strong></p> <p><strong>Patrick Watters</strong></p> <p><strong>Nicola Smith</strong></p> <p><strong>Sheryl Gascoigne</strong></p> <p><strong>Simon Hughes</strong></p> <p><strong>Max Mosley</strong></p> <p><strong>Claire Ward</strong></p> <p><strong>Hugh Grant</strong></p> <p><strong>Eimear Cook</strong></p> <p><strong>Christopher Eccleston</strong></p> <p><strong>Steve Coogan</strong></p> <p><strong>Alex Best</strong></p> <p><strong>Nicola Duffett</strong></p> <p><strong>Duncan Foster</strong></p> <p><strong>Jude Law</strong></p> <p><strong>Lee Chapman</strong></p> <p><strong>Leslie Ash</strong></p> <p><strong>James Burdge</strong></p> <p><strong>Stephen Kelly</strong></p> <p><strong>Sheila Coleman </strong></p>",
  "<p>Once a Republican citadel which welcomed presidential candidates from Goldwater to Bush, the southern Californian city of Santa Ana is no longer a bastion of conservatism. Street vendors hawking soccer T-shirts in their native Spanish outside packed taquerias and panaderias show the diverse face of the city and the size of the challenge to California's declining Republican Party in the heart of its ideological cradle, Orange County.</p> <p>Santa Ana is a flashpoint for <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/06/0669000.html\">America's changing demographics</a>. The city's Republican party is locked in a struggle with the statewide California Republican group, over how it can win back a burgeoning Latino population that has turned the state bright blue.</p> <p>The city has shifted from having been the domain of fiery Republican Congressman \"B-1\" Bob Dornan to being represented by <a href=\"http://lorettasanchez.house.gov/\">Democrat Loretta Sanchez</a>. Santa Ana is one of the few cities in the county where Democratic registration is much higher than that of the Republicans. In the 2008 presidential election, Barack Obama defeated John McCain in the city by a landslide \u2013 65% to 32%.</p> <p>\"The Latino vote is going to make a big difference,\" said Tamar Jacoby, a self-described conservative who is president of <a href=\"http://www.immigrationworksusa.org/\">ImmigrationWorks USA</a>, a federation of state-based pro-immigration business coalitions. \"That's where the divide is in the Republican Party \u2013 people who get it and those for whom it doesn't matter.\"</p> <p>Jacoby's organization, while non-partisan, has close ties to Republican forces favoring immigration reform and is among a small but growing group of conservatives who recognize that the party faces becoming irrelevant at state level. It can no longer elect a Republican to statewide office and it is on the verge of dropping below a one-third share of the state legislature. If the party wants to remain viable, it must recruit Latinos \u2013 and they are increasingly hostile to the party.</p> <p>\"Latinos don't agree with Democrats on many social issues, but they don't trust the Republican Party either,\" <a href=\"http://www.foxandhoundsdaily.com/2011/03/8810-why-the-sky-is-falling-california-republican-party/\">said California GOP political strategist Allan Hoffenblum</a>. Hispanics fear, Hoffenblum said, that the GOP's hard-line immigration policy \"singles them out\" for harassment and discrimination.</p> <p>The Lincoln Club of Orange County has long been a haven for relatively moderate Republicans. It recently broke the ice on the Republican immigration issue and departed from the conservative consensus. </p> <p>\"Republicans and a vast majority of Latinos agree that border security must be the first order of business. It's how Republicans propose to deal (or not deal) with the illegal immigrants who are already here that will either correct or exacerbate the perception that Republicans are racist,\" wrote Lincoln Club Executive Director Clare Venegas on Red County, a widely-read conservative website. \"Core Republican values such as the belief in free markets, strong national security and family values are a natural starting point for potential immigration reforms that could appeal to Latinos without compromising conservative principles.\"</p> <p>The Lincoln Club's <a href=\"http://www.lincolnclub.org/aboutus/immigration-statement/\">three-point plan</a> calls for increased border security and the creation of a guest-worker program that would allow foreign workers and illegal immigrants already in the US to apply for temporary work permits if they met requirements such as proof of employment and passed a criminal background check.</p> <p>The proposal echoes much of the reform that was called for by George W Bush during his first term as president. It was Bush, not the Democrats, who put comprehensive immigration reform back on the national agenda, via his 2004 State of the Union speech. But any notion of immigration liberalization has since been erased from the Republican establishment agenda.</p> <p>Jacoby argues that Bush's call to reform could serve as a model for whoever is elected president in 2012. </p> <p>\"Bush totally got the issue and was incredibly courageous on it,\" said Jacoby. \"I can't praise his understanding enough \u2013 he was truly Nixon goes to China. A lot of people understand we need scientists, but he realized we also need agricultural workers and we need a legal way for them to come. It's also about dignity and family, and not making them crawl around in the shadows.\"</p> <p>In the intervening years, however, the Republican Party abandoned calls for reform. In 2008 the presidential candidate John McCain, who a few years earlier had co-authored the most liberal of immigration reform measures with the Democrat Ted Kennedy, had moved back to a hardline position.</p> <p>It is no surprise that some of the more advanced Republican proposals on immigration are coming from California, and, more precisely, Orange County.</p> <p>California Republicans held power until in 1994 the then-GOP governor Pete Wilson, a moderate, <a href=\"http://migration.ucdavis.edu/mn/more.php?id=492_0_2_0\">lined up behind Proposition 187</a>. It was to prove a fateful decision. </p> <p>The proposition aimed to set up a citizenship-screening system that would cut off public services, including healthcare and education, from undocumented immigrants. It was slammed as unconstitutional and anti-immigrant. Wilson was re-elected on the crest of white support for the proposition, which was approved by a wide 59%-41% margin, but the courts blocked Proposition 187 and a backlash tidal wave of Latino registration and voting subsequently capsized the Republicans in California. </p> <p>With the exception of the former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Republicans have not been able to elect a single statewide office holder for more than a decade.</p> <p>\"It's not what you say \u2013 it's how you say it. Harsh rhetoric against Latinos is endemic throughout the Republican Party,\" said Hoffenblum. \"I'm Jewish and a lot of people would say to me, 'How come there aren't very many Jews in the Republican Party?' Well, if events back then were held at a country club where Jews weren't welcomed, people see that as anti-Semitic.\"</p> <p>Some of the party's most influential Republicans are urging the GOP's 2012 presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, to reconsider his tone on the issue of immigration.</p> <p>\"Don't just talk about Hispanics and say immediately we must have controlled borders. Change the tone would be the first thing. Second, on immigration, I think we need to have a broader approach,\" said <a href=\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2012/06/13/jeb-bush-urges-romney-change-tone-on-immigration/\">the former Florida Governor Jeb Bush in June</a>.</p> <p>Despite the dilemma the GOP faces, for many Republicans the issue of immigration is rooted in principles \u2013 in particular, fiscal responsibility.</p> <p>\"It's a difficult challenge to the degree that demographics is destiny and to the extent that segments of society increasingly look to government for free stuff,\" said former Orange County State Assemblyman Chuck DeVore, now a senior visiting scholar at the <a href=\"http://www.texaspolicy.com/\">Texas Public Policy Foundation</a>, giving voice to the prevailing party position on the issue. \"Unless Republicans want to join Democrats in advocating for more government, it's doubtful whether they can win over this demographic unless they first convince them that less government is a better way to get good jobs.\"</p> <p>Many prominent Republicans reject the notion that the GOP's support for Proposition 187 was a game-changing mistake. Instead, they say the issue remains one of exaggerated entitlement and that ultimately voters, including Latinos, will need to accept free-market principles more openly.</p> <p>Recent election results have shown Santa Ana and Orange County Latinos voting in small majorities alongside Republicans on conservative social issues but remaining overwhelmingly Democratic on economic and tax issues and in presidential polling.</p> <p>\"Mitt Romney is a national businessman,\" said Jacoby. \"I think he has to see and would see, as president, the economic benefits that immigrants bring.

  "<p>Serving tea, coffee and cake at the Hot Gossip cafe in the centre of Henley-on-Thames, Lorraine Hillier says local people are all of one mind. \"We all want him back,\" says the former deputy mayor, who is a Tory councillor, when asked about Boris.</p> <p>\"Do I think the current MP would stand aside for him? I think he may recognise that, yes. We have a very good MP in John Howell, but he always knew Boris was a hard act to follow.\"</p> <p>Rumours that mayor of London Boris Johnson, MP for Henley from 2001 to 2008, could be looking for a dramatic return to parliament via a reunion with his old seat have been circulating for months.</p> <p>Other parliamentary berths which could be vacated for Johnson are also being gossiped about. In Croydon South there is talk of a deal after the MP, Richard Ottaway, refused to say if he might retire and hand over to Boris. \"All these matters will be resolved\", Ottaway said.</p> <p>But it is Henley where Johnson's heart, and second home, lies. In the town there is little hostility to David Cameron, but there is little affection for him either. It is different with Boris. In the market everyone has an anecdote about the first time they saw his shock of dishevelled blond hair. They all tell stories, fondly, of his frayed shirts, terrible timekeeping and bumbling manner.</p> <p>\"At every event he went to, garden party or whatever, he would always somehow miss the reception party at the front by coming round the back. It was uncanny,\" said one.</p> <p>\"I remember when he was shopping in Silvers men's store for a jacket for the Henley regatta. He picked this one thing up and the attendant just said, 'erm, I think that's too hairy for Henley, Boris',\" said another.</p> <p>But while he is the object of ribbing, his ex-constituents respect him and think he could be prime minister. He gets things done, said Hillier, 56. \"He was very active in the town, he was great for fundraising, and if he said he would do something, he would do it.\" David Silvester, a fellow Henley councillor, said: \"I think he would probably be better for the country than the present prime minister; rather him than this bumbling along.\"</p> <p>If Henley awaits the return of Boris with excitement, so do Conservative delegates gathering on Saturday for the party's conference in Birmingham. With Cameron's leadership in the spotlight, Boris \u2013 after his re-election as mayor in May and the triumph of the Olympics \u2013 is the golden boy. In Downing Street they know Boris will almost certainly outshine Cameron. And there is nothing they can do to stop him. </p> <p>On Monday evening, in front of 800 people, Johnson will speak for 10 minutes (followed by 25 minutes of questions and answers) at a ConservativeHome fringe-cum-victory-rally, entitled Boris Johnson's 2012: Re-elected and Olympotastic. It will be \"Boris unleashed\" \u2013 a \"tub-thumping\" performance, say friends. </p> <p>But aides have no idea what he will say. \"He always writes it at the last minute,\" said one. Boris will then go to a London Conservatives' meeting to hail the Olympic success again. On Tuesday he will address the full conference. Then after lunch he will be out of town, leaving Cameron to do his thing.</p> <p>David Cameron is a good conference performer and will no doubt put on a strong show. But he will need to, because Boris is far from his only problem. After months of policy U-turns, there are signs of a government losing its grip. </p> <p>The Tories are still reeling from two more own goals: the chaotic handling of the franchise decision on the west coast main line, and the row over chief whip Andrew Mitchell allegedly calling Downing Street police \"plebs\". Mitchell has decided not to turn up to conference because he will be a distraction. On Saturday Jeremy Hunt, the new health secretary, exploded another bomb by saying he backed a reduction in the time limit for women to have abortions from 24 to 12 weeks. Even the Tory right thought it an unwise move.</p> <p>Then there is the challenge from newly confident Labour, which emerged from its conference last week more optimistic and united than at any time since the May 2010 general election. Ed Miliband's 70-minute speech, launching \"One Nation Labour\", swept away many of the doubts about his leadership.</p> <p>Sunday's Opinium/<em>Observer</em> poll shows Labour has enjoyed only a small post-conference bounce, up two points to 41%, an 11% lead over the Tories, who are up 1%. But Miliband's personal ratings have improved impressively with his net approval rating of -10% being the best so far recorded by Opinium. Miliband is now well ahead of Cameron on -21% and Nick Clegg on -48%. Thirty per cent of voters approve of the way Cameron is doing his job (against 51% who disapprove) while 28% approve of Miliband's performance (with 38% disapproving).Cameron's lead is being eroded at a rate that will alarm his party.</p> <p>A couple of weeks ago, the Tories had wanted to paint Miliband as weak. They have been forced to finesse that message now. Instead they will begrudgingly accept that he can perform, but will tear into him for failing to address the biggest issue of the day: how to cut the deficit.</p> <p>\"The joke in the party is that it is quite an achievement to speak for 70 minutes without notes, but even more of an achievement to ... say absolutely nothing,\" said a senior strategist. \"The message from conference will be 'now it is time for the grown-ups'\".</p> <p>Cameron and chancellor George Osborne will paint themselves as hard men, capable of taking tough decisions on spending, education, welfare and pensions. \"Labour isn't learning\" will be another conference message.</p> <p>But grassroots Tories will not be content with Ed-bashing. Large numbers of MPs and activists are deeply unhappy, not just with life in coalition, but with what they see as the themeless leadership of Cameron. Many detest the idea of gay marriage, cannot comprehend why Cameron wants to pour billions more into overseas aid, and want a firm promise of a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU, which will almost certainly not be forthcoming.</p> <p>Writing in the <em>Observer</em> , the Tory MP Phillip Lee takes a potshot at all party leaders, including his own. \"Political packaging like David Cameron's 'big society' or, more recently, Ed Miliband's 'One Nation', mean nothing to voters who only want the tangible product inside the box.\" By contrast, he says Boris seems real.</p> <p>With over two years to go of this coalition, Tory voters will be crying out for evidence that the party still stands for Conservative values \u2013 on crime, immigration, Europe and on marriage. They won't want to hear that Miliband lacks authenticity and substance, anything like as much as they will want reassurance that their own leader possesses those qualities.</p> <p>Back in Henley, Charlotte Snowden, 39, a professional photographer selling her pictures on a market stall, says the first time she met Johnson he changed her life. \"I was sitting next to him at a lunch. I had young children and I knew he had five. I said, 'Boris, you've got children, I'm spending all night getting up to deal with them, how do you cope with it?' He lifted his head and just said, 'Don't get up'. And from then on I didn't and everything has been great.\"</p> <p>If Cameron made such a joke now he would be panned. But for the time being at least, Boris is a law unto himself.</p>",
  "<p>It was a bold old statement of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's to suggest that it will do Arsenal good to compensate for Robin van Persie's goals by sharing the load around his newly assembled front line. His team rose to the challenge at the Boleyn Ground, with a first Premier League goal for Olivier Giroud and fine strikes from Theo Walcott and Santi Cazorla crowning a valuable away win.</p> <p>Having suffered a setback last weekend with a performance against Chelsea that left Wenger complaining about a lack of personality, Arsenal responded with character. Confronted by an old nemesis in the shape of a Sam Allardyce team that backed them into an awkward corner by opening the scoring, the Gunners struck the right combination of force and finesse. They remain unbeaten away and continue to play some compelling football on the road.</p> <p>For all the talk of the damage a direct approach could inflict on an Arsenal team that have crumbled at set pieces lately, West Ham struggled to load too much pressure on a side benefitting from the reintroduction of the assured Per Mertesacker. Although Andy Carroll was an imposing presence, the home team were unable to mount a sustained offensive. \"You can never control him for 90 minutes, but we fought with him,\" Wenger said.</p> <p>The selection of his own big target man \u2013 and it was Giroud's first league start for more than a month \u2013 ensured West Ham also had plenty to concern themselves with. The former Montpellier striker's all round contribution was impressive. Several attempts on target, a goal and an assist is no bad return for an evening's work.</p> <p>With Arsenal even looking dangerous from the set piece, West Ham duly took the lead with some virtuoso skill. So much for stereotypes. In the 21st minute, George McCartney fed the ball to Mohamed Diam\u00e9, who powered into the box, leaving Aaron Ramsey in his wake, and bent the ball ferociously into the far corner of the net. It was a marvellously executed finish from the huge Senegalese, who celebrated his first goal for the club with such relish he was cautioned after throwing himself into the crowd. He can count himself lucky as, shortly afterwards, he recklessly careered late into Mikel Arteta, but the referee, Phil Dowd, elected not to reach for another card.</p> <p>The goal knocked Arsenal out of their stride and it was the man who had been struggling most obviously for confidence who grabbed Arsenal by the scruff of the neck to get them back into the game. Giroud gathered the ball in midfield, arced a pass out to Lukas Podolski and sprinted in front of his marker to lash the return ball past Jussi Jaaskelainen. West Ham had opportunities to retake the advantage, with Kevin Nolan twice in shooting range and Carroll outjumping Vito Mannone, but neither player could quite find their range.</p> <p>Both teams jostled for position after the break. West Ham had to readjust around the hour mark when Ricardo Vaz T\u00ea dislocated a shoulder as he rashly challenged Mannone. Allardyce's initial assessment was an absence of between six to 12 weeks. Kieran Gibbs was another injury concern after suffering a thigh problem and is very doubtful for the England squad.</p> <p>Walcott, who started on the bench yet again but came on to provide another example of why he yearns for a striking role, played a critical part in the comeback. Giroud's deft assist set the fleet-footed attacker bearing down on goal. The finish was instinctive and ruthless, as Walcott passed the ball beyond Jaaskelainen. Message received and understood? We'll see.</p> <p>Allardyce was left frustrated. \"The second goal was a killer because we were in a fantastic position to score at that stage. Because we picked up the wrong pass, we've opened ourselves up and they've severely punished us on the break,\" he conceded.</p> <p>The clincher came from a player who has become integral to Arsenal. When Walcott found Cazorla with a flick, the Spaniard arrowed a brilliant, precision third from 25 yards out. Since the beginning of last season no player from Europe's top leagues has scored more often from outside the box than Cazorla. \"He's taken the Premier League by storm,\" Walcott said. \"He's fantastic to play with every day. He's our conductor. I don't even know what foot is his best to be honest.\" Either, or both, are proving to be a considerable weapon.</p>",
  "<p>Drive west from Orkney's capital, Kirkwall, and then head north on the narrow B9055 and you will reach a single stone monolith that guards the entrance to a spit of land known as the Ness of Brodgar. The promontory separates the island's two largest bodies of freshwater, the Loch of Stenness and the Loch of Harray. At their furthest edges, the lochs' peaty brown water laps against fields and hills that form a natural amphitheatre; a landscape peppered with giant rings of stone, chambered cairns, ancient villages and other archaeological riches.</p> <p>This is the heartland of the Neolithic North, a bleak, mysterious place that has made Orkney a magnet for archaeologists, historians and other researchers. For decades they have tramped the island measuring and ex- cavating its great Stone Age sites. The land was surveyed, mapped and known until a recent chance discovery revealed that for all their attention, scientists had completely overlooked a Neolithic treasure that utterly eclipses all others on Orkney \u2013 and in the rest of Europe.</p> <p>This is the temple complex of the Ness of Brodgar, and its size, complexity and sophistication have left archaeologists desperately struggling to find superlatives to describe the wonders they found there. \"We have discovered a Neolithic temple complex that is without parallel in western Europe. Yet for decades we thought it was just a hill made of glacial moraine,\" says discoverer Nick Card of the Orkney Research Centre for Archaeology. \"In fact the place is entirely manmade, although it covers more than six acres of land.\"</p> <p>Once protected by two giant walls, each more than 100m long and 4m high, the complex at Ness contained more than a dozen large temples \u2013 one measured almost 25m square \u2013 that were linked to outhouses and kitchens by carefully constructed stone pavements. The bones of sacrificed cattle, elegantly made pottery and pieces of painted ceramics lie scattered round the site. The exact purpose of the complex is a mystery, though it is clearly ancient. Some parts were constructed more than 5,000 years ago.</p> <p>The people of the Neolithic \u2013 the new Stone Age \u2013 were the first farmers in Britain, and they arrived on Orkney about 6,000 years ago. They cultivated the land, built farmsteads and rapidly established a vibrant culture, erecting giant stone circles, chambered communal tombs \u2013 and a giant complex of buildings at the Ness of Brodgar. The religious beliefs that underpinned these vast works is unknown, however, as is the purpose of the Brodgar temples.</p> <p>\"This wasn't a settlement or a place for the living,\" says archaeologist Professor Colin Richards of Manchester University, who excavated the nearby Barnhouse settlement in the 1980s. \"This was a ceremonial centre, and a vast one at that. But the religious beliefs of its builders remain a mystery.\"</p> <p>What is clear is that the cultural energy of the few thousand farming folk of Orkney dwarfed those of other civilisations at that time. In size and sophistication, the Ness of Brodgar is comparable with Stonehenge or the wonders of ancient Egypt. Yet the temple complex predates them all. The fact that this great stately edifice was constructed on Orkney, an island that has become a byword for remoteness, makes the site's discovery all the more remarkable. For many archaeologists, its discovery has revolutionised our understanding of ancient Britain.</p> <p>\"We need to turn the map of Britain upside down when we consider the Neolithic and shrug off our south-centric attitudes,\" says Card, now Brodgar's director of excavations. \"London may be the cultural hub of Britain today, but 5,000 years ago, Orkney was the centre for innovation for the British isles. Ideas spread from this place. The first grooved pottery, which is so distinctive of the era, was made here, for example, and the first henges \u2013 stone rings with ditches round them \u2013 were erected on Orkney. Then the ideas spread to the rest of the Neolithic Britain. This was the font for new thinking at the time.\"</p> <p>It is a view shared by local historian Tom Muir, of the Orkney Museum. \"The whole text book of British archaeology for this period will have to be torn up and rewritten from scratch thanks to this place,\" he says.</p> <p><br>Farmers first reached Orkney on boats that took them across the narrow \u2013 but treacherously dangerous \u2013 Pentland Firth from mainland Scotland. These were the people of the New Stone Age, and they brought cattle, pigs and sheep with them, as well as grain to plant and ploughs to till the land. The few hunter-gatherers already living on Orkney were replaced and farmsteads were established across the archipelago. These early farmers were clearly successful, though life would still have been precarious, with hunting providing precious supplies of extra protein. At the village of Knap o'Howar on Papay the bones of domesticated cattle, sheep and pigs have been found alongside those of wild deer, whales and seals, for example, while analysis of human bones from the period suggest that few people reached the age of 50. Those who survived childhood usually died in their 30s.</p> <p>Discarded stone tools and shards of elegant pottery also indicate that the early Orcadians were developing an increasingly sophisticated society. Over the centuries, their small farming communities coalesced into larger tribal units, possibly with an elite ruling class, and they began to construct bigger and bigger monuments. These sites included the 5,000-year-old village of Skara Brae; the giant chambered grave of Maeshowe, a Stone Age mausoleum whose internal walls were later carved with runes by Vikings; and the Stones of Stenness and the Ring of Brodgar, two huge neighbouring circles of standing stones. These are some of the finest Neolithic monuments in the world, and in 1999 they were given World Heritage status by Unesco, an act that led directly to the discovery of the Ness of Brodgar.</p> <p>\"Being given World Heritage status meant we had to think about the land surrounding the sites,\" says Card. \"We decided to carry out geophysical surveys to see what else might be found there.\" Such surveys involve the use of magnetometers and ground-penetrating radar to pinpoint manmade artefacts hidden underground. And the first place selected by Card for this electromagnetic investigation was the Ness of Brodgar.</p> <p>The ridge was assumed to be natural. However, Card's magnetometers showed that it was entirely manmade and bristled with features that included lines of walls, concentric pathways and outlines of large buildings. \"The density of these features stunned us,\" says Card. At first, given its size, the team assumed they had stumbled on a general site that had been in continuous use for some time, providing shelter for people for most of Orkney's history, from prehistoric to medieval times. \"No other interpretation seemed to fit the observations,\" adds Card. But once more the Ness of Brodgar would confound expectations.</p> <p>Test pits, a metre square across, were drilled in lines across the ridge and revealed elaborate walls, slabs of carefully carved rock, and pieces of pottery. None came from the Bronze Age, however, nor from the Viking era or medieval times. Dozens of pits were dug over the ridge, an area the size of five football pitches, and every one revealed items with a Neolithic background.</p> <p>Then the digging began in earnest and quickly revealed the remains of buildings of startling sophistication. Carefully made pathways surrounded walls \u2013 some of them several metres high \u2013 that had been constructed with patience and precision.</p> <p>\"It was absolutely stunning,\" says Colin Richards. \"The walls were dead straight. Little slithers of stones had even been slipped between the main slabs to keep the facing perfect. This quality of workmanship would not be seen again on Orkney for thousands of years.\"</p> <p><br>Slowly the shape and dimensions of the Ness of Brodgar site revealed themselves. Two great walls, several metres high, had been built straight across the ridge. There was no way you could pass along the Ness without going through the complex. Within those walls a series of temples had been built, many on top of older ones. \"The place seems to have been in use for a thousand years, with building going on all the time,\" says Card.</p> <p>More than a dozen of these temples have already been uncovered though only about 10% of the site has been fully excavated so far.</p> <p>\"We have never seen anything like this before,\" says York University archaeologist Professor Mark Edmonds. \"The density of the archaeology, the scale of the buildings and the skill that was used to construct them are simply phenomenal. There are very few dry-stone walls on Orkney today that could match the ones we have uncovered here. Yet they are more than 5,000 years old in places, still standing a couple of metres high. This was a place that was meant to impress \u2013 and it still does.\"</p> <p>But it is not just the dimensions that have surprised and delighted archaeologists. Two years ago, their excavations revealed that haematite-based pigments had been used to paint external walls \u2013 another transformation in our thinking about the Stone Age. \"We see Neolithic remains after they have been bleached out and eroded,\" says Edmonds. \"However, it is now clear from Brodgar that buildings could have been perfectly cheerful and colourful.\"</p> <p>The men and women who built at the Ness also used red and yellow sandstone to enliven their constructions. (More than 3,000 years later, their successors used the same materials when building St Magnus' Cathedral in Kirkwall.) But what was the purpose of their construction work and why put it in the Ness of Brodgar? Of the two questions, the latter is the easier to answer \u2013 for the Brodgar headland is clearly special. \"When you stand here, you find yourself in a glorious landscape,\" says Card. \"You are in the middle of a natural amphitheatre created by the hills around you.\"</p> <p>The surrounding hills are relatively low, and a great dome of sky hangs over Brodgar, perfect for watching the setting and rising of the sun, moon and other celestial objects. (Card believes the weather on Orkney may have been warmer and clearer 4,000 to 5,000 years ago.) Cosmology would have been critical to society then, he argues, helping farmers predict the seasons \u2013 a point supported by scientists such as the late Alexander Thom, who believed that the Ring of Brodgar was an observatory designed for studying the movement of the moon.</p> <p>These outposts of Neolithic astronomy, although impressive, were nevertheless peripheral, says Richards. The temple complex at the Ness of Brodgar was built to be the most important construction on the island. \"The stones of Stenness, the Ring of Brodgar and the other features of the landscape were really just adjuncts to that great edifice,\" he says. Or as another archaeologist put it: \"By comparison, everything else in the area looks like a shanty town.\"</p> <p>For a farming community of a few thousand people to create such edifices suggests that the Ness of Brodgar was of profound importance. Yet its purpose remains elusive. The ritual purification of the dead by fire may be involved, suggests Card. As he points out, several of the temples at Brodgar have hearths, though this was clearly not a domestic dwelling. In addition, archeologists have found that many of the stone mace heads (hard, polished, holed stones) that litter the site had been broken in two in exactly the same place. \"We have found evidence of this at other sites,\" says Richards. \"It may be that relatives broke them in two at a funeral, leaving one part with the dead and one with family as a memorial to the dead. This was a place concerned with death and the deceased, I believe.\"</p> <p>Equally puzzling was the fate of the complex. Around 2,300BC, roughly a thousand years after construction began there, the place was abruptly abandoned. Radiocarbon dating of animal bones suggests that a huge feast ceremony was held, with more than 600 cattle slaughtered, after which the site appears to have been decommissioned. Perhaps a transfer of power took place or a new religion replaced the old one. Whatever the reason, the great temple complex \u2013 on which Orcadians had lavished almost a millennium's effort \u2013 was abandoned and forgotten for the next 4,000 years.</p> <p><br><em>For more information or to donate to the dig, go to </em><a href=\"http://orkneyarchaeologysociety.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>orkneyarchaeologysociety.org.uk</em></a></p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong>The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has come under heavy criticism after the comments he made <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/06/jeremy-hunt-12-week-abortion-limit\" title=\"\">backing a reduction in the legal time limit for abortion from 24 to 12 weeks</a> overshadowed plans for a Tory fightback at this week's party conference in Birmingham.</p> <p>Hunt was attacked by politicians of all parties, including Conservatives who were dismayed at his timing. Health experts and women's rights campaigners were also angered, saying he had thoughtlessly resurrected a highly sensitive debate that none of the main parties wants to reopen.</p> <p>In a newspaper interview, Hunt said that on the \"incredibly sensitive\" issue of abortion, \"my own view is that 12 weeks is the right point for it. It is just my view about that incredibly difficult question \u2013 about the moment we should deem life to start. I don't think the reason I have that view is for religious reasons.\"</p> <p>While Downing Street was clearly taken aback by the remarks, David Cameron was forced to come out to defend his health secretary. \"He is absolutely entitled to hold an individual view, a view of conscience, and on this issue all members of parliament \u2013 prime ministers, health secretaries, everybody \u2013 have to vote according to their consciences,\" Cameron said. \"They are totally entitled to hold that view, but people need to know the government has got no plans to bring forward any legislation in this area and any vote that does happen will be a free vote.\"</p> <p>However, home secretary Theresa May said she believed there was scope to reduce the limit on when a termination can take place to 20 weeks. May stressed that all ministers were expressing personal views and that the government had no plans to review the 24-week time limit. But she added: \"I think there is scope for some reduction. My own view is probably a reduction to 20 weeks. That is a personal view of mine.\"</p> <p>Cameron added that he was in favour of decreasing the limit to 20 weeks: \"I personally have voted for a modest reduction from the current limit of 24 weeks because I think there are some medical arguments for that. But I don't agree with the 12-week limit and that's not the government's policy,\" he said.</p> <p>The prime minister, who had hoped to use the weekend papers to restate his personal commitment to the NHS, found his efforts blown off course by the resulting furore.</p> <p>Lord Steel, the former Liberal leader and architect of the 1967 Abortion Act, expressed his dismay and warned of the consequences of botched back-street abortions if the law is changed. <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/world/2012/oct/07/abortion-philip-hammond\" title=\"\">Writing in the <em>Observer</em></a>, he says: \"If [Hunt] is concerned at the high number of abortions, he will find that the UK figures are broadly in line with most European countries, and a good deal lower than in the US where abortion remains a contentious political issue.\"</p> <p>Steel added: \"Mr Hunt is of course entitled to his personal views, but as secretary of state for health he should not be contemplating putting back the clock for the women of this country.\" Former Tory cabinet minister John Redwood said that the focus on abortion was an unwelcome distraction. \"I do not understand why we needed an argument about abortion if there is no plan to make any changes,\" he added.</p> <p>Tim Montgomerie, editor of the ConservativeHome website, said Hunt was merely restating views that he had held for years. But he added: \"It is a nightmare for Cameron \u2026 This was not the topic he wanted in the news headlines. Today was supposed to be about his reaffirmation of his personal commitment to the NHS.\"</p> <p>Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper described Hunt's remarks as \"chilling\". She said: \"Jeremy Hunt's statements on abortion are deeply worrying and show the health secretary has given no serious consideration to women's health.</p> <p>\"Everyone has personal views but as health secretary, Jeremy Hunt has a responsibility to lead government policy on women's health. Perhaps the most chilling part of his interview is the claim that 12 weeks is based on evidence when it undoubtedly is not.</p> <p>\"David Cameron needs to make sure his health secretary doesn't distort medical evidence and does not impose his own view on women about their health.\"</p> <p>Anthony Ozimic of the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children said any move to reduce the abortion limit was doomed to failure. \"There is a large pro-abortion majority in parliament which will ensure that any time-limiting amendments are rejected while using the opportunity to push for pro-abortion amendments,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The real political debate about abortion in the UK should focus \u2013 as it does elsewhere in the world \u2013 on the right to life of all unborn children and on the way governments bankroll abortion access at home and abroad.\"</p> <p>Diane Abbott, shadow health minister, accused Hunt of using abortion as an issue to win support within the Tory party. She said: \"Pretty shocking that leading Tory politicians are lining up to attack women's reproductive rights on the basis of no support in the medical community.\"\"</p> <p>A source close to Hunt said: \"It wasn't planned \u2013 he was asked a question and he gave an answer.\" I don't know if the prime minister has been in touch.\" She added: \"If there was a vote in parliament it would be a free vote and Jeremy's wouldn't count any more than anyone else.\"</p> <p>Deborah Mattinson, founder of the research agency BritainThinks, said such remarks by senior cabinet ministers showed a lack of discipline.</p> <p>\"The problem is that this is a massive distraction. The problems the coalition have with women voters is not around abortion, it's much more bread and butter stuff \u2013 women feel they are more likely to be the victims of cuts and lose their jobs and have their wages frozen, and of course they are.</p> <p>\"It's the core political issues that they have a problem with.

And welcome to a gloriously sunny autumnal Saturday afternoon, packed with the kind of unbelievably exciting fixtures which make the Premier League the best league in the entire world, better in oh so many ways than all the other countries' leagues, such as Swansea v Reading, and West Brom v QPR.</p> <p>Oh.</p> <p>As it happens, this afternoon's four top-flight fixtures feature every single member of the current Premier League bottom three, and just 30% of the current Premier League top 10. But we won't let that bother us, and will instead put all our energy into getting excited about third-placed <strong>Everton</strong>, who are at <strong>Wigan</strong>, sixth-placed <strong>West Brom</strong> against Mark Hughes' bottom-of-the-pile Rangers, and table-topping <strong>Chelsea</strong>. The latter will be proving that the old \"most competitive league in the world\" canard isn't quite all it's cracked up to be by slamming a bootful of beauties past hapless <strong>Norwich</strong> (disclaimer: some assumptions were made in the preparation of this sentence), who shipped five at home to previously winless Liverpool last time out. All eyes on John Terry and Ashley Cole, if selected (and their Twitter accounts if not).</p> <p>But we're not only interested in the top flight, even if we are denied the chance to follow the fortunes of the new leaders of the Championship because Cardiff's visit to hopelessly-out-of-sorts Ipswich is today's televised late kick-off. They could find themselves second by then, if <strong>Leicester</strong> extend their four-game run of wins at home to <strong>Bristol City</strong> (and to be more accurate, they could find themselves fifth if they get seriously unlucky). Also interesting: <strong>Blackburn</strong> hosting fellow Maytime Premier League relegationees <strong>Wolves</strong>; third-place <strong>Brighton</strong> taking the division's best away record to <strong>Derby</strong>; and rock-bottom <strong>Peterborough</strong>, who lost their first seven league games but have won their last two \u2013 away from home and everything \u2013 hosting 17th-place <strong>Nottingham Forest</strong> knowing that a third win on the spin would see them overtake their opponents and (probably) saunter merrily clear of the bottom three.</p> <p>In <strong>League One</strong>, unbeaten table-toppers <strong>Tranmere</strong> \u2013 \"If we play like we did in the second half at Scunthorpe, I don't think there's anyone in this league who can live with us,\" says Ronnie Moore \u2013 visit a <strong>Notts County</strong> side still in fourth but smarting after a nasty midweek defeat to second-placed Stevenage. \"What you don't do after a defeat is get off the bus,\" said Keith Curle, and I for one have absolutely no idea what he means.</p> <p>And in <strong>League Two</strong> there'll be a bit of a mini-league involving four of the top five, with second-placed <strong>Port Vale</strong> visiting fourth-placed <strong>Exeter</strong>, and fifth-placed <strong>Cheltenham</strong> hosting third-placed <strong>Fleetwood</strong>. <strong>Gillingham</strong>, already five points clear, will gleefully watch them all take points off each other while they seek to extend their 100% away record at mid-table <strong>Oxford United</strong>.</p> <p>So, that's what I'm excited about today \u2013 well, that and my own team's inevitable victory over whichever hapless bunch of unfortunates are unlucky enough to be ordered into their fearsome arena. What have I missed?</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>2.21pm: This Blackburn-related news is just in from the Press Association: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Alan Shearer has admitted he is open to the possibility of taking up the vacant manager's role at Blackburn. The former Rovers striker, who had a short spell in management with Newcastle, spent four years at Ewood Park as a player. When asked about his interest in the job, the 42-year-old told BBC's Football Focus: \"I've not spoken to the Blackburn owners. If they approached me I would speak to them.\" </p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>2.28pm: Chelsea's team has been widely tweeted but not yet Press Associationed, so you'll have to make do with Swansea v Reading:<br><strong>Swansea:</strong> Vorm, Rangel, Chico, Williams, Davies, Dyer, Britton, Michu, Ki, Routledge, Graham. <strong>Subs:</strong> Tremmel, Tate, Hern\u00e1ndez, Shechter, Moore, De Guzman, Tiendalli. <br><strong>Reading:</strong> McCarthy, Shorey, Mariappa, Gorkss, Cummings, McAnuff, Karacan, Tabb, Kebe, Pogrebnyak, Hunt. <strong>Subs: </strong>Stuart Taylor, Pearce, Le Fondre, McCleary, Robson-Kanu, Guthrie, Roberts. <br><strong>Referee:</strong> Mike Dean (Wirral).</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>2.30pm: And here are some more teams. I'll post all the Premier League line-ups as I get them, but feel free to request others.<br><strong>Wigan:</strong> Al Habsi, Ramis, Caldwell, Figueroa, Boyce, McCarthy, McArthur, Beausejour, Kone, Di Santo, Maloney.<strong> Subs:</strong> Pollitt, Jones, Watson, Gomez, McManaman, Boselli, Miyaichi. <br><strong>Everton:</strong> Howard, Coleman, Jagielka, Heitinga, Baines, Mirallas, Neville, Osman, Pienaar, Fellaini, Jelavic. <strong>Subs:</strong> Mucha, Oviedo, Naismith, Distin, Gueye, Anichebe, Duffy. <br><strong>Referee: </strong>Kevin Friend (Leicestershire).</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>2.35pm: The Chelsea team is in, and John Terry and Ashley Cole both start.<br><strong>Chelsea:</strong> Cech, Ivanovic, Lu\u00edz, Terry, Cole, Mikel, Lampard, Mata, Oscar, Hazard, Torres. <strong>Subs: </strong>Turnbull, Romeu, Ramires, Moses, Cahill, Azpilicueta, Bertrand. <br><strong>Norwich:</strong> Ruddy, Russell Martin, Barnett, Bassong, Garrido, Elliott Bennett, Howson, Hoolahan, Johnson, Tettey, Holt. <strong>Subs: </strong>Bunn, Turner, Snodgrass, Jackson, Pilkington, Morison, Ryan Bennett. <br><strong>Referee:</strong> Anthony Taylor (Cheshire).</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>2.39pm: And to complete the Premier League pack, this is how the sides will line up at the Hawthorns:<br><strong>West Brom:</strong> Foster, Tamas, McAuley, Olsson, Popov, Yacob, Mulumbu, Gera, Morrison, Odemwingie, Long. <strong>Subs: </strong>Luke Daniels, Rosenberg, Dorrans, Jara Reyes, Lukaku, Dawson, Fortun\u00e9. <br><strong>QPR:</strong> Julio Cesar, Bosingwa, Ferdinand, Nelsen, Hill, Granero, Mbia, Wright-Phillips, Taarabt, Park, Zamora.<strong> Subs:</strong> Green, Traor\u00e9, Ciss\u00e9, Mackie, Onuoha, Hoilett, Faurlin. <br><strong>Referee: </strong>Mike Jones (Cheshire).</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>2.40pm: Manchester City have comprehensively beaten Sunderland 3-0 at the Etihad. Nothing now to distract us from those 3pm kick-offs.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>2.53pm: Sky's Soccer Saturday panel are discussing unpopular managers. I'm mildly surprised to hear that the one manager who Matt Le Tissier played under but didn't like, was Glenn Hoddle.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>2.56pm: Players are strolling onto pitches across the nation. We're moments from matchtime.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>3.00pm: Let's play football!</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>3.03pm: Fernando Torres just broke the Norwich offside trap, with three minutes played, but delayed his shot, was forced wide, then had to check back and give the ball away. He should just have smacked it into the back of the net.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>3.06pm: <strong>GOAL! West Brom 1 QPR 0!</strong> Lovely cross from Shane Long on the right wing, who pegged it past his full-back as if on a jet pack, and then curled the ball onto the head of James Morrison, who headed back across goal and in. Simple, and excellent.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p>3.07pm: \"Ashley Cole, he tweets what he wants,\" sing the Chelsea fans.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p>3.11pm: <strong>GOALS! First, Chelsea 0 Norwich 1!</strong> A superbly controlled low volley from Holt from 15 yards out, from some other fella's knock-down.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p>3.12pm: <strong>Another goal! Wigan 1 Everton 0!</strong> This time it's a cross from the left which Arouna Kon\u00e9 nods in from two yards out. Was he offside? It certainly looked that way!</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p>3.14pm: <strong>And another goal! Wigan 1 Everton 1!</strong> Another header from no distance out! Everton bring the ball towards the edge of Wigan's area but the player who attempts a curler to the far post falls over while he's doing it, and the ball is miscued onto the head of Jelavic, two yards beyond the far post, who nodded in.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>3.16pm: <strong>And yet another goal! Chelsea 1 Norwich 1!</strong> And that's the goal of the day so far. Mata gets the ball on the right wing, towards the byline. He backheels to Ivanovic, whose excellent first-time cross is headed into the far corner by Fernando Torres.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p>3.23pm: <strong>GOAL! Chelsea 2 Norwich 1!</strong> Torres attempts to overhead kick a bouncing ball in the Norwich penalty area, and indeed succeeds in completing the overhead kick. But instead of flying into the back of the net the ball scoots away from goal, straight to the onrushing Frank Lampard, who lashes it in from 18 yards.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p>3.25pm: <strong>GOAL! West Brom 2 (Zoltan Gera 22) QPR 0!</strong> Must admit I totally missed that one, but Matt Le Tissier tells me it was a nasty miskicked clearance from Anton Ferdinand that Gera simply slotted in.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p>3.26pm: <strong>Another goal! Wigan 2 Everton 1! </strong>This time Kon\u00e9 is the provider, running down the right wing, cutting into the penalty area and then rolling the ball, alarmingly slowly, just about into the path of Franco Di Santo, who slams it into the roof of the net from 12 yards.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p>3.30pm: Bradley Johnson just injured two Chelsea players in the space of about a second, bashing into Mikel and then slashing away at Lu\u00edz, as if engaged in some kind of human skittles. Both the boys in blue roll around for a while, looking quite put out, before getting on with the game. No booking for Johnson, which seems like a stroke of luck for the lad.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p>3.32pm: <strong>GOAL! Chelsea 3 Norwich 1!</strong> Mata carries the ball 40 yards and then slices the Norwich defence entirely and convincingly apart with a delicious killer pass, and Eden Hazard passes it into the corner of the net. That was very nice. They could score 50 here.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p>3.34pm: <strong>GOAL! Swansea 0 Reading 1!</strong> Swansea pass the ball around their defence, as they do. Pok, pok, pok, pok, pok. It ends up with Vorm, and Reading closing him down, so he puts his foot through it. Big mistake. Ten seconds later, and without touching the ball again, the home side are behind, Pogrebnyak eventually poking it under the keeper and into the net.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p>3.35pm: <strong>GOAL! West Brom 2 QPR 1!</strong> That's a super goal! Granero hits the ball over the West Brom defence \u2013 or three of them, the left back being 10 yards further back \u2013 and Taarabt chests it down and volleys it emphatically into the net. Nicely done.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p>3.37pm: Crikey! So many Premier League goals, it really is the best league in the world.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p>3.40pm: Another chance for Chelsea. Oscar collects the ball a couple of yards outside the penalty area, and with a small army of Norwich defenders blocking his path. He casually skips his way through them, but his side-footed finish is equally casual and Ruddy saves.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p>3.44pm: Another chance at Stamford Bridge, but this one falls to Norwich. Not much to it, really \u2013 a looping cross from the left wing, Grant Holt unmarked in the middle, and his header bounces a yard wide.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p>3.46pm: And a chance at the Hawthorns, where Morrison (I think) is played clean through, but Julio Cesar saves!</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p>3.47pm: <strong>GOAL! Swansea 0 Reading 2! </strong>A Reading player has a shot blocked, but the ball falls to another Reading player, whose shot is also blocked, but the ball falls to a third Reading player, whose shot is also blocked, and this time the ball loops to Noel Hunt who volleys home from eight yards.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p>3.53pm: Fun and games at Vicarage Road, where Matej Vydra was sent off just before half-time \u2013 but nobody knows why. Chris Kamara on Soccer Saturday had no idea, and Watford's official Twitter feed is reporting that the \"crowd, journos and players [are] equally confused\". They're 1-1 with Middlesbrough at the break.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p>3.57pm: \"Greetings from Cairo,\" writes Simon Frank. \"With Chelsea handing out a pounding today, are we to expect a 'Ruddy Hell' headline tomorrow?\" Quite possibly, Simon \u2013 but <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4337807/England-Euro-2012-news-John-Ruddy-out-of-Euros-with-broken-finger.html\">it wouldn't be the first time we'd have seen it</a>, I'm afraid.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p>4.01pm: Let's play football!</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p>4.04pm: At Stamford Bridge, the first chance of the second half falls to Norwich, with Grant Holt again beating Terry in the air, but heading wide.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p>4.07pm: \"Simon, why on earth are the Norwich crowd booing Cole?\" asks Barry Praag. \"Are they FA stooges!\" There are any number of things that convince fans to boo an opposing player, some of them bizarrely trivial, but being Ashley Cole has got to be among the most compelling (for all that he's been a brilliant full-back).</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p>4.09pm: Chelsea should have had a penalty there, as Barnett fairly cynically sticks out a leg to bring down Juan Mata, but the referee's not impressed.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p>4.11pm: More on the ghost red card at Vicarage Road. \"Saw footage at HT with Chris Kamara, here at #watfordfc for Sky Sports,\" writes whoever writes Watford's official Twitter feed. \"Kamara in absolutely no doubt that there was nothing in it at all.\"</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p>4.13pm: Swansea hit the post! That was a not-very-good header that Alex McCarthy darn nearly flapped into the back of the net. In the end he merely flapped it onto the post, which was a stroke of luck. Having said that, I've just seen someone else on Twitter say the header was \"brilliantly turned onto the post\", so I could be being a tad harsh.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p>4.19pm: I may be making a bit of a big deal of this red card at Vicarage Road, which Kamara has now said on Sky Sports was \"completely wrong\", but a glance at <a href=\"http://www.soccerbase.com/referees/referee.sd?referee_id=1055\">the referee's stats for the season</a> are illuminating \u2013 it's his eighth red card in 10 league games. Last season he produced six in 34 \u2013 what happened to him this summer?</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p>4.30pm: Ryan Dunne points out that Norwich fans might have been convinced to boo Ashley Cole not just by yesterday's Anti-FA Twitter outburst, but by the section of Cheryl Cole's forthcoming autobiography serialised in today's Sun. This details his extramarital indiscretions \u2013 \"Over the next few days I heard two more girls had come forward to say they'd had sex with Ashley. I didn't read the stories, but I knew one was saying it happened when Ashley and I were courting, and another said she slept with him a few months after our wedding.\" \u2013 and includes her yelling at her footballing then-husband: \"I hope she was worth it. It's the end of your marriage. It's f***ed!\"</p> <p>Incidentally, courting? Courting? Are you living in the 1950s, Cheryl?</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p>4.31pm: <strong>GOAL! Swansea 1 Reading 2! </strong>Routledge's cross from just outside the right corner of the penalty area clips a defender's arse and skews to the far post, where Machu Pichu scores with a diving header. About time we had a Premier League goal, I must say.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p>4.34pm: <strong>GOAL! Chelsea 4 Norwich 1!</strong> Hazard's cross, Mata's hugely unconvincing attempt to control, Ivanovic's emphatic volley. Ruddy got both hands to it, but couldn't keep it out.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p>4.36pm: <strong>GOAL! Swansea 2 Reading 2! </strong>Reading give the ball away, Routledge plays a one-two, bursts into the penalty area, and scores at the near post with the outside of his right foot to complete Swansea's comeback.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p>4.39pm: Talking of comebacks, Crystal Palace were 2-0 down at home to Burnley after 40 minutes. They just made it 4-2. Nice.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p>4.41pm: Bakary Sako has put Wolves 1-0 up against Blackburn at Ewood Park. Quite a tasty strike, by all accounts.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p>4.43pm: <strong>GOAL! West Brom 3 QPR 1!</strong> Mulumbu passes the ball to Morrison on the edge of the area and then continues his run. Morrison plays a one-two with, um, someone else, gets into the box, and pulls the ball back for Mulumbu to score.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p>4.45pm: <strong>GOAL! Wigan 2 Everton 2!</strong> Everton's fifth penalty appeal is the first that the referee's agreed with. Leighton Baines, against his former club, makes no mistake from the spot, sending the ball flying into the top right corner of the goal (as he was looking at it).</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p>4.49pm: Peeeeep! The final whistle has gone at Stamford Bridge, where Chelsea have beaten Norwich 4-1. And Reading have hit the bar at Swansea.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p>4.51pm: <strong>GOAL! West Brom 3 QPR 2!</strong> Another lovely goal, a decent spell of pressure ending with Esteban Granero receiving the ball from Park Ji-Sung, beating a couple of men with his turn and then chipping the ball into the near top corner of the net from just outside the penalty area.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p>4.54pm: Peeeep! West Brom have beaten QPR, though only just \u2013 the visitors' last chance coming from Granero's corner, which ended in a decent shooting chance being sent over the bar with the last kick of the game. Final score: 3-2.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p>4.56pm: Peeeep peeeep! All the Premier League matches are now over, with Swansea and Reading and Wigan and Everton all drawing 2-2.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p>5.00pm: In the Championship, Leicester go top, at least briefly, after beating Bristol City 2-0. Elsewhere Wolves won 1-0 at Blackburn, and Crystal Palace came back from 2-0 down to beat Burnley 4-3. In League One, leaders Tranmere have won 1-0 at Notts County, but League Two leaders Gillingham could only draw 0-0 at Oxford. At the other end, Barnet twice took the lead at Southend but still couldn't hold on, and drew 2-2. Meanwhile in the Scottish Third Division, Stirling Albion have beaten Rangers 1-0.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p>5.03pm: Meanwhile, the teams are in for the late kick-off at Arsenal.

  "<p>At least Chelsea are getting things right on the pitch. A week in which the fallout from the John Terry race case contaminated the club even further concluded with a gleaming victory against a Norwich City side that took the lead before being blown away. The European champions' style in other regards is questionable, but the increased panache with which they are playing is pleasing.</p> <p>The Chelsea manager, Roberto Di Matteo, has spoken constantly since the start of the season of his determination to rotate his squad to preserve the team at full freshness for the arduous campaign ahead, but he clearly felt no need to shield two of his most senior players from the intense scrutiny that they are currently under as Terry and Ashley Cole were included from the start.</p> <p>The publication on Friday of the FA disciplinary panel's justification for finding Terry guilty of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand \u2013 which included the suggestion that unreliable evidence from Cole helped cover up the offence \u2013 does not appear to have diminished the pair's standing at Stamford Bridge.</p> <p>Terry, who will use the international break to mull over whether to appeal against the FA's finding, retained the captaincy, the large banner reading \"JT CAPTAIN, LEADER, LEGEND\" was displayed as prominently as ever and when each players' name was announced before kick-off, the scornful boos of Norwich fans were drowned out by worshipful cheers from the blue-clad faithful. The home crowd continued belting out hymns to the Chelsea duo throughout.</p> <p>Chelsea's opponents, however, did not seem so eager to give them an easy ride. In the corresponding fixture last season, Grant Holt gave Terry the sort of bullying he has seldom endured and the striker started here as if intent on dishing out similar treatment.</p> <p>The Norwich striker evaded Terry in the 11th minute to open the scoring with a fine goal, firing the ball into the net from 10 yards out after Leon Barnett had nodded a Wes Hoolahan cross into his path.</p> <p>The slickness of that goal contrasted alarmingly with Norwich's chaotic defending. Within three minutes Chelsea were level. Juan Mata backheeled the ball to Branislav Ivanovic, who clipped it towards the six-yard box, where Fernando Torres was allowed to head it, unchallenged, into the net.</p> <p>The Spaniard had squandered a clear chance in the second minute, his lack of confidence leading him to hesitate long enough for S\u00e9bastien Bassong to atone for sloppy marking and win back the ball, but the goal emboldened the Chelsea striker.</p> <p>His extravagant overhead kick attempt was blocked by Bradley Johnson in the 22nd minute, but the ball broke to Frank Lampard, who dispatched it emphatically into the bottom right-hand corner from the edge of the box.</p> <p>The tricky trio of Mata, Oscar and Eden Hazard now took charge, embroidering fluent moves with gorgeous touches. Norwich were frequently beguiled, even if they did still pose intermittent threats going forward, Alexander Tettey even spurning a great chance to plunder a second goal when he headed way off target after neat work down the right by Hoolahan and Russell Martin.</p> <p>Mata created Chelsea's third, running 40 yards before slipping a perfectly timed pass to Hazard, who slotted past the Norwich keeper, John Ruddy, to make it 3-1. Cole, Mikel John Obi and Oscar all went close to aggravating the damage before Holt gave a reminder that Chelsea could not afford to switch off, heading just wide after a cross by Johnson. The striker repeated the warning in the second minute of the second half, leaping high above Terry to meet another Johnson cross and send another header inches past the post.</p> <p>Norwich's persistent slackness in defence was captured by an incident in the 53rd minute, when Leon Barnett dawdled in his own box and then appeared to shunt Hazard to the ground as the Belgian darted in to claim the ball. But to the visible disbelief of one dug-out and the relief of the other, referee Anthony Taylor decided against awarding a penalty.</p> <p>Ruddy had to dive at the feet of Mata in the 58th minute to prevent Chelsea from extending their lead after another cutting move by the hosts. The keeper did the same again in the 75th minute to thwart Torres.</p> <p>Having established almost total control by now, Chelsea turned down the urgency of their approach. With victory apparently secured, enjoying themselves became the priority. As their intricacy quotient increased, they became less clinical. That surely spared Norwich a more severe beating. Ivanovic, however, did deliver another blow in the 77th minute, ramming a fierce shot into the net from 10 yards out after Mata had slightly fortuitously teed him up.</p> <p>That was the third league goal of the season for a defender who, as much as anyone else, reflects the new flamboyance with which Chelsea strive to play. They now lead the Premier League by four points. \"Our start shows we are able to blank things out that are surrounding us externally and focus on our target and job, which is to win matches,\" said Di Matteo. \"It's proven how professional the group is.\"</p>",
  "<p>Manchester City moved above their neighbours in the Premier League table by recording their fourth win of the season and, at long last, their first clean sheet, though it is probably true to say most defences would end up feeling better about themselves after playing the timid travellers of Sunderland. It was certainly a different exercise to trying to keep Borussia Dortmund at bay, almost a different ball game. There might be no easy games in the English league, or so everyone keeps saying, but some games are vastly less demanding than others.</p> <p>Roberto Mancini made wholesale changes after what he described as a poor performance in midweek, bringing back Joleon Lescott and Micah Richards in the centre of defence and recalling Carlos Tevez and Mario Balotelli in place of Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Edin Dzeko up front. Though City's Champions League reviews were mostly dominated by Joe Hart's goalkeeping heroics it did not escape the manager's notice that several excellent opportunities were squandered by home strikers at the other end. \"We had three or four incredible opportunities and I don't know why we didn't score,\" Mancini said.</p> <p>Sunderland are not quite up to Dortmund standards and this was ponderous, running-through-treacle stuff after the high-speed pressing and precision on show on Wednesday, but it only took a few minutes for City's returning front two to make their mark. Balotelli played Tevez into an enormous amount of space, Carlos Cu\u00e9llar was rightly booked for bringing him down as he attempted to access the penalty area, and from the free-kick Aleksandar Kolarov handsomely beat Simon Mignolet with a shot over the wall that the goalkeeper could not reach.</p> <p>City should have had a second when Pablo Zabaleta found himself with a shooting opportunity on the halfway line but could only hit Mignolet, then Balotelli, after twice being floored by overzealous challenges from Craig Gardner, shot over the bar from close range following James Milner's cross from the right.</p> <p>Upon reaching the interval without further damage Sunderland stirred themselves briefly at the start of the second half, with Adam Johnson finally showing up on his return to the Etihad with a decent run down the right and a good cross, and Steven Fletcher lining up a close-range volley that required Richards to make an athletic block.</p> <p>Johnson did not have the happiest of afternoons, complaining of sickness and coming off before the end and, as Martin O'Neill revealed he was still vomiting in the dressing room after the game had finished, the winger may not be in the best shape to join up with England this week. City still came closest to scoring the next goal, however, when Yaya Tour\u00e9 forced a save from Mignolet following David Silva's clever backheel, before Balotelli read Kolarov's low cross from the left correctly but narrowly failed to make the important contact.</p> <p>That was the end of the Italian's involvement, Ag\u00fcero replacing him for the final half-hour, and exactly on the hour the substitute struck with the sort of deadly composure that had been missing in midweek. Silva fed Kolarov down the left, the full-back supplied one of his stock low crosses, and Ag\u00fcero's first-time finish from the six-yard line had the ball past Mignolet before the Sunderland defence had properly woken up to the danger.</p> <p>If Balotelli was upset at being hooked, and he did not appear best pleased, at least he could not argue with the upshot. \"I am happy with Mario, he played a good game,\" Mancini said, despite his striker appearing to disappear straight down the tunnel instead of joining the rest of the squad on the bench. \"I don't know why he did that,\" the City assistant coach David Platt said. \"He doesn't normally.\"</p> <p>Tevez missed a great chance and Silva struck the bar as the game descended into a turkey shoot at the Sunderland end. Milner finally added a third a minute from time with another direct free-kick from just outside the area, though by that stage everyone was beginning to wonder what would happen should City somehow manage to concede in the closing seconds. Mancini would have been furious, but Sunderland never put the matter to the test.</p> <p>Hart's next game will be against San Marino, and this was ideal preparation. \"We should have done better than that,\" O'Neill admitted. \"We were well beaten by a superior team, but I'm still unhappy about us giving the ball away too easily. City are always going to punish you for that.\"</p>",
  "<p>Juli\u00e0n Castro, the mayor of San Antonio who burst on to the national political stage when he made the keynote address at the Democratic national convention in September, is selling his vision of the future to the city's top moneymakers. He pictures a Manhattan-like metropolitan core, with walkable streets and arts and culture worthy of America's seventh-largest city.</p> <p>Castro calls this vision \"San Antonio 2020\". In a city where <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/48/4865000.html\">two-thirds of the 1.3 million residents are of Latino heritage</a>, it is tempting to call it \"veinte veinte\".</p> <p>In fact, Castro hardly speaks any Spanish. But that is part of what makes his vision so powerful. In the fastest-growing major city in the country, a well-heeled and mostly white audience at the Witte Museum listens to the new-generation Hispanic leader, who is aged only 38, share his plans. In doing so, he is advancing a slow-motion political takeover of Texas.</p> <p>\"San Antonio is a peek at the Texas of tomorrow and the America of tomorrow,\" Castro says. \"We've called it the new face of the American dream.\"</p> <p>2020 is, by coincidence, the projected date by which, if current trends continue, the state will come full circle. Texas, which was once part of Mexico, <a href=\"http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/tif/population.html\"> will return to being majority Hispanic</a>.</p> <p>Texas is already a state with a majority-minority population \u2013 Hispanics account for about 38% of the population but other ethnic groups push the non-white proportion to 52%. This trend has enormous potential consequences for both main political parties.</p> <p>For Republicans, such demographic change spells a possible end to their long reign in the state. The Democrats have failed to seize their opportunity \u2013 on average, <a href=\"http://www.newstaco.com/2011/05/17/how-the-latino-vote-matters-in-2012/ \">Hispanics vote 3-1 for Democrats </a> \u2013 but the state GOP has nonetheless been swerving rightward, straight into a demographic brick wall.</p> <p>Despite the fact that Texas has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter in 1976, the Republicans may see their political Alamo in San Antonio. </p> <p>\"You get California, Texas and New York,\" says Choco Meza, a former Bexar County Democratic Chair, tracing the states' geographical positions in the air, \"and that little 'v' is for 'victory'.\"</p> <p>However, Texas Democrats have yet to match action to such enthusiasm when it comes to bringing out the Hispanic vote. Unlike in California or New Mexico, Hispanics in Texas have been fighting well below their political weight. Hispanic turnout rates are poor \u2013 almost half that of white or black voters in the state. <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/socdemo/voting/publications/p20/2008/Table%2004a.xls\">In 2008 only 38% of eligible Hispanics cast ballots in the presidential election</a>.</p> <p>San Antonio incubated such landmark political Hispanic groups as the League of United Latin American Citizens and the Southwestern Voter Registration Education Project. These and other movements began in the city's Westside, the heart of its Hispanic community. There lie both the symptoms and the solutions to the political woes of Texas' Hispanics.</p> <p>This barrio region begins a few blocks away from San Antonio's bustling downtown, where tourists flock to The Alamo and the Riverwalk. In the Westside, cheap, wood-framed houses are painted salmon pink or lime green; many have clothes drying on a line. Ernest Bromley, who walked Westside's tree-lined avenues in the 1970s as a political canvasser, sees the community's symbolic divide in the appearance of such houses.</p> <p>\"There are homes that take care of themselves; a lot of home pride and flowers that are well-kept,\" Bromley says, \"and others that are just trashed. You can be poor and have a nice-looking place.\"</p> <p>Bromley, a Democrat, and his Republican business partner, Lionel Sosa, are legends in the Hispanic community, having created the first advertising firm that reached an Hispanic audience. Sosa is a master of the emotional political ad who has advised dozens of Republican campaigns \u2013 including George W Bush's 2004 run that won 49% of the Texas Hispanic vote. The tagline for that campaign was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHghAjADiXc\">\"Nos conocemos\" \u2013 \"we know each other\"</a>.</p> <p>For years, the Hispanic population in Westside was not politically engaged. As late as the 1960s, much of the area had dirt roads and a patchwork electrical service. Yearly storms created pop-up rivers that destroyed property and stranded residents. Disenchantment with the system kept turnout low, allowing such problems to fester. </p> <p>There has been some progress. From 1996 to 2008, Hispanic turnout increased by nearly 10 points and reached an all-time high for Hispanics. But the 38% turnout in the 2008 election was still <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/socdemo/voting/publications/p20/2008/Table%2004a.xls\">well below the 57% turnout among California's Hispanic population</a>.</p> <p>Castro, however, hints at something that could begin to galvanize Hispanic voters in San Antonio and beyond. \"It may come in the form of some great candidate or candidates that decide they're going to run [for governor],\" he says. \"And that's what lights up the Hispanic community.\"</p> <p>Castro swears he is not speaking of himself, though his political star is undoubtedly rising. Instead, he uses the example of his idol, Henry Cisneros. <a href=\"http://www.texasmonthly.com/preview/2001-07-01/reporter \">San Antonio's Hispanic vote doubled in 1981</a> when the striking, 6ft 3in, third-generation Mexican-American became its mayor.</p> <p>Cisneros, however, has a cautionary tale to tell. The nation's first Hispanic mayor of a major city had a rapid ascent to the national stage as part of Bill Clinton's administration, before he became embroiled in a scandal involving payoffs to a former mistress that ended his political career.</p> <p>Now a housing-policy consultant, Cisneros still lives on the Westside \u2013 in a community that he tried to modernize which is, in many ways, still stuck in the past. In the Westside, stagnation can take many forms. </p> <p>Crystal Cox, 26, returned home after earning her bachelor's degree, and found that little had changed. \"My best friend from elementary school lives across the street and she has a couple of kids,\" she says. \"It's weird to come back home and see people that I knew and they ended up just having kids and stopped with their education.\"</p> <p>Her friend follows an all too familiar and growing trend among Hispanics in Texas: <a href=\"http://hobbycenter.rice.edu/workarea/downloadasset.aspx?id=2147484251\">it is thought that by 2040, more than half will not graduate high school</a>.</p> <p>In 2011, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2011/12/22/144079041/texas-schools-grapple-with-big-budget-cuts\">the Republican legislature in Texas cut $4bn from public schools</a>. Party leaders argued that the state's budget had been in crisis, that cuts needed to be made, and that education spending was the largest piece of the pie.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.texastribune.org/library/data/schools/\">a school system that is almost 50% Hispanic</a>, this was another harsh blow to the poorer districts \u2013 as well as to any Republican hopes of winning Hispanic converts.</p> <p>Even in a city as diverse as San Antonio, divides in class and race run deep. Henry Flores, dean of the Graduate School at St Mary's University and a consultant on many Democratic races, doesn't need to search too far to find remnants of a \"members only\" mindset.</p> <p>\"Take a look at the girls in that back party,\" he says, pointing to a stream of young women, dressed in their Texas best, heading to a restaurant's private room. \"You're not going to find any Latinas there.\"</p> <p>The political culture in Texas has capitalized on such small moments of division. Last year, two incendiary pieces of legislation alienated many Hispanics \u2013 one a voter ID law and the other a new district layout.</p> <p>Both have ended up in court. <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304373804577525072239849392.html\">The voter ID law required Texans to show valid state ID at the polling place</a>. The Obama administration challenged it as a violation of the Voting Rights Act, claiming that it targeted poor Hispanics without driver's licenses.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/29/us/final-texas-redistricting-maps-approved.html\">The new district lines contained no new electoral regions that were majority Hispanic</a>. This too went through the legal system, to arrive at a compromise of two new Hispanic and two new Anglo districts. This was a disappointment to Hispanics, considering that they have driven 65% of the state's population growth in the past decade.</p> <p>Texas was different when the Republican businessman Sosa helped George W Bush win nearly half the Hispanic vote in 2004, with a message of strong family values and a welcoming atmosphere. Now, he says he can hardly recognize the party that plays on fear of Hispanic immigration and calls, in Mitt Romney's case during the Republican primaries, for \"self-deportation\".</p> <p>\"If you look at Reagan's position on immigration and amnesty, he did it,\" Sosa says. \"It was somewhat controversial, but no big deal.\"</p> <p>But as much reason as Democrat-inclined Hispanics have to vote, there has not been a momentous shift towards the ballot box. Voter-registration groups estimate that it would take a huge \u2013 and expensive \u2013 outreach effort to register the million Hispanics who could help to turn Texas blue.</p> <p>Big-party money goes toward swing-state campaigns, rather than a more distant investment like Texas \u2013 even one that could have such a high return.</p> <p>\"Democrat voters, even in Texas, send all their money to the swing states,\" says Lydia Camarillo of the Southwestern Voter Registration Education Project. \"Trying to build up the Hispanic voter base here just isn't the way they think. If it was and they did Texas would be purple in five years.\"</p> <p>Even the most optimistic Texas Democrats have a hard time looking at the years of unfulfilled expectations without showing their frustration. The numbers are there, the future is evident, and yet the moment remains just out of reach.</p> <p>\"I've been waiting for the Hispanic sleeping giant to wake up in the 70s, the 80s, the 90s and now [the] 2000s and I've seen it in Time magazine every decade,\" Flores said. </p> <p>When will the giant wake?</p> <p>\"The answer to that question is: 'I don't know.'\"</p> <h2>Pueblo factbox</h2> <p>(All demographic data comes from the 2010 US census.

  "<p>David Cameron has insisted the government has no plans to change the law to cut the time limit on abortions from 24 weeks to 12.</p> <p>But he did say he would support calls for a smaller decrease in the abortion limit should the issue come up for a vote in parliament.</p> <p>His comments came after the newly promoted health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said he was in favour of cutting the current time limit for women to have abortions in half.</p> <p>He claims that evidence suggests 12 weeks in the appropriate time restriction but insisted his beliefs were not based on his religious values.</p> <p>But the prime minister said on Saturday that he did not agree with the health secretary's position and there were no plans to bring forward any legislation on changing abortion time limits.</p> <p>He said Hunt was entitled to his own opinion, adding: \"He is a member of parliament, he is absolutely entitled to hold an individual view, a view of conscience and on this issue all members of parliament \u2013 prime ministers, health secretaries, everybody \u2013 has to vote according to their consciences.</p> <p>\"They are totally entitled to hold that view but people need to know the government has got no plans to bring forward any legislation in this area and any vote that does happen will be a free vote.\"</p> <p>The prime minister added that he was in favour of a smaller decrease in the abortion limit.</p> <p>\"I personally have voted for a modest reduction from the current limit of 24 weeks because I think there are some medical arguments for that. But I don't agree with the 12-week limit and that's not the government's policy,\" he said.</p> <p>The intervention by Hunt reignited hostilities over one of the most polarising issues in politics on the eve of the Conservative party conference.</p> <p>His comments came just days after Maria Miller, the women's minister, backed calls for a reduction in the legal limit for abortions.</p> <p>The home secretary, Theresa May, also spoke out on the issue on Saturday, saying she believed there was scope to reduce the limit on when a termination can take place, to 20 weeks into a pregnancy.</p> <p>In an interview with the Times, Hunt said there was evidence to suggest that the abortion limit should be reduced, adding: \"I'm not someone who thinks that abortion should be made illegal. Everyone looks at the evidence and comes to a view about when that moment is and my own view is that 12 weeks is the right point for it.</p> <p>\"It is just my view about that incredibly difficult question about the moment that we should deem life to start.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I don't think the reason I have that view is for religious reasons.\"</p> <p>His comments have been welcomed by pro-life campaigners who insist that the current abortion laws are out-of-date and technology shows that at 12 weeks an unborn child is capable of sustained movement.</p> <p>A Life spokesman, Mark Bhagwandin, said: \"The UK's abortion laws are antiquated and fail to take into consideration a modern reality in which it is easy to establish as biological fact, the humanity of the baby inside the womb. In the age of information it is hard to hide this fact. It is therefore no surprise that most people, especially women, in this country support a reduction in the time limit on abortion in the UK.\"</p> <p>But the health secretary's views have caused concern to women's rights activists who warned that a reduction in the time limit could effectively prevent testing for conditions such as Down's syndrome.</p> <p>Professor Wendy Savage, a gynaecologist and campaigner on women's rights, said: \"The number of abortions that take place over 20 weeks is very small. Of those a considerable proportion are of foetuses which have got a congenital abnormality.</p> <p>\"I think the majority of the population think that if somebody has got a foetus that, if born, will have a severe disability they should have the right to choose whether or not to continue with that pregnancy.\"</p> <p>Diane Abbott, who is Labour's shadow public health minister, accused ministers of \"playing politics with people's lives\", insisting there was no justification for a reduction in the present limit.</p> <p>\"We're seeing a sustained ideological attack on the science, and the rights that British women and families have fought for,\" she said.</p> <p>\"There is no evidence to support a reduction in the abortion time limit and this view is supported across the medical profession.</p> <p>\"Late abortion only affects a small number of women, who are often in extremely challenging circumstances.\"</p> <p>There were nearly 190,000 abortions for women in England and Wales last year.</p> <p>The figures, from the Department of Health, also suggest the vast majority \u2013 91% \u2013 were carried out in under 13 weeks.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States\">Prohibition in the US was a huge, miserable failure</a>. During its 13-year run, beginning in 1920, Prohibition caused a massive rise in organized crime and actually increased alcohol consumption instead of curtail it. </p> <p>After Prohibition's repeal in 1933, kids didn't start drinking in record numbers. Society didn't collapse. Today, bathtub gin dealers don't run amok on playgrounds; microbreweries don't protect their turf with automatic weapons. Instead, a safe environment to drink was created when the government began regulating and taxing alcohol. </p> <p>And yet, here we are in 2012, giving Prohibition another shot. For lack of a better word, that's just stupid. </p> <p>Today, instead of alcohol prohibition, we've got the government's harmful attempt to prohibit marijuana use. With record federal deficits and states teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, why do we insist on dumping billions of tax dollars into another failed prohibition that is accomplishing nothing other than making criminals out of millions of regular citizens and fueling drug cartels that threaten our security?</p> <p>Last year, 800,000 people were arrested in the United States for crimes associated with marijuana \u2013 and marijuana alone. It's insane to arrest people for choosing to use a natural substance that is, by any objective standard, less harmful than alcohol, a drug that is advertised at every major sporting event. Think of the strain and costs to our law enforcement, court system and prisons. And for what? Is marijuana use decreasing? No. Are cartels any less powerful and violent? I'm afraid not. Is pot difficult for minors to obtain? Nope. In fact, when polled, kids say it's easier to get marijuana than it is to get alcohol. Why? It's simple. Black market dealers don't ID. </p> <p>And yet we go around and around \u2026 trying the same methods and always getting the same terrible results. Isn't it time to try something different?</p> <p>In 1999, when I was governor of New Mexico, I began advocating for marijuana legalization. At the time, there were precious few high-ranking elected officials willing to stick out their necks for this issue. It was considered political suicide.</p> <p>Today, polls in the US show that at least 50% of Americans are now open to the idea or fully supportive of legalizing marijuana. My experience is that, the more people look at the drug issue, the more they recognize that the \"war on drugs\" is a dismal and expensive failure. It's costing more than an absurd sum of money; it's costing people their future. </p> <p>In the US, 100 million people have themselves violated our drug laws at some time or another. In fact, President Obama has readily admitted his own youthful drug use. Had he been caught and arrested, would he be president today? How many promising young people's lives and ambitions are being derailed by senseless drug laws?</p> <p>This November, voters in several states will have the opportunity to vote on marijuana legalization and medical marijuana laws. I hope the citizens of these states will carefully consider these initiatives. Once they do, I'm confident they'll give them their full support. They just make too much sense. And as more states begin to align their laws with common sense and reality, it is inevitable that the federal government will eventually follow.</p> <p>I strongly believe the tide is turning on this issue, and it's because of education and thoughtful discussion. The more we learn about marijuana and our federal government's futile and ill-advised attempt to prohibit it, the more the solution becomes clear. America will be better-off when marijuana is managed like alcohol and tobacco. Our border with Mexico will be safer, and addiction will at last be treated as the health concern it is, rather than as a criminal justice issue. </p> <p>It's truly unfortunate that President Obama doesn't see what's coming. Not only does he refuse to acknowledge the support this issue is gaining, more shockingly, he has blatantly gone back on his promise to allow states to administer their own marijuana laws. The Obama administration has shut down hundreds of state-legal medical marijuana dispensaries and is currently threatening to shut down many more.</p> <p>It's odd: when it comes to marriage rights, President Obama is quick to cede the federal government's power to the states. But when it comes to states deciding for themselves how best to tackle the marijuana issue, Obama steps right in and insists that the federal government knows best. </p> <p>I am confident American voters this November will send a signal that the time is long past that we stop putting people behind bars and forever labeling them as criminals for behavior that is personal, private, and no more \"criminal\" than drinking alcohol or taking legal pain medicine.&#xa0;</p> <p>When that signal is sent, perhaps we can put an end to modern-day Prohibition, just as we did nearly 80 years ago.</p>",
  "<p>While giant rallies in Caracas may be drawing the world's attention ahead of Venezuelan presidential election, the global significance of the vote can be found hundreds of miles to the east in the oil-soaked Orinoco Belt.</p> <p>According to studies, Venezuela has overtaken Saudi Arabia to become number one in the world for proven oil reserves, largely thanks to the heavy crude found in this vast alluvial plain.</p> <p>Whether this multi-trillion dollar asset is controlled by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez or the opposition challenger, Henrique Capriles, will influence which countries and companies are given the priority to exploit them and how much drivers around the world pay at the pump. According to a report this year by BP, Venezuela has reserves of 296.5bn barrels, about 10% more than Saudi Arabia and 18% of the global total. At the country's current levels of production, this would last about 100 years.</p> <p>If Ch\u00e1vez wins \u2013 as most polls suggest \u2013 he has promised to ramp up production and reduce his country's dependence on the US market by doubling crude exports to Asia. To further this goal, Venezuela plans to build a pipeline through Colombia to the Pacific which would reduce costs and transport times to China and other Asian markets.</p> <p>Capriles, who has mounted a strong challenge, says he would fire the oil minister, Rafael Ram\u00edrez, and rethink how crude is extracted and used. Until now Russian and Chinese companies have struck the biggest deals for future exploitation.</p> <p>\"We have to revise every deal. I think they are agreements that are not functioning,\" he said. During the campaign, he has also said he would halt subsidised oil shipments to Cuba, Belarus, Nicaragua and Syria. Critics say he is a stalking horse for US interests.</p> <p>Both Ch\u00e1vez and Capriles are calling for more investment so that Venezuela can increase not only output but also the quality of oil through the use of upgrading technology. But the volatile mix of politics and oil has made it difficult to secure partners.</p> <p>In recent years Venezuelan oil production has fallen due to poor maintenance, low investment and the loss of key workers. Plans to open new fields have been repeatedly delayed. The state-owned oil company PDVSA says the holdups are over. Last week its joint venture with Russia's Rosneft and Lukoil pumped its first barrel. Another operation, with a Vietnamese firm, has also reportedly begun. Projects with Chevron of the US, Spain's Repsol and others are due to start early next year.</p> <p>But there are still many empty blocks. Officials said BP, Shell and several other multinationals appear to be waiting to see if the government will change today before committing to possible joint ventures in the two main areas for expansion, Carabobo and Jun\u00edn.</p> <p>\"There is a danger that British firms might miss out. In this country, oil and politics are intertwined. Many companies are waiting for the election result,\" said Osmel Molina, deputy manager of the Carabobo region. \"They hope for higher profits if the political situation changes. That's why there is so much support for the opposition. They don't necessarily want to oust Ch\u00e1vez, but they do want a weak government so they can control the biggest oil resources in the world.\"</p> <p>Venezuela has an oil-dependent economy \u2013 PDVSA accounts for 95% of the country's export earnings. Domestically, the mix of populist politics, super-abundant oil and second-rate refining technology has left the country with a peculiar system in which the state sells crude for $100 (\u00a361) a barrel, buys back petrol at $400, then sells it on to domestic drivers at such a discount that a full tank is cheaper than a cup of coffee. A gallon costs about 6p, leading to a lucrative cross-border petrol-smuggling business. Neither candidate has dared to commit to a raise.</p> <p>Oil rose to the centre of the political debate in 2003, when the sector was crippled by striking workers. The Ch\u00e1vez government, which had survived a coup attempt the previous year, sacked most of the management and many of the workers, saying that they were pawns in a US-backed effort to destabilise the country.</p> <p>The industry is now a bastion of government loyalists. Molina's office is decorated with portraits of Ch\u00e1vez and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. Most of the staff wear red Ch\u00e1vez re-election campaign T-shirts. Four oilfields are named after battles of independence.</p> <p>Oil helps to explain why Ch\u00e1vez is vilified in the US. In 2000, a year after taking power, he made his first mark on global affairs with a tour of the Middle East to lobby key Opec members \u2013 Iraq, Iran, Libya, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia \u2013 to drive oil prices higher. Since then, the cost of Brent crude has risen from less than $20 a barrel to more than $100.</p> <p>Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi were among the leaders who joined Ch\u00e1vez to drive up prices. Molina believes it is no coincidence that they were deposed and killed: \"There's a plan in place to control the global oil market. Anyone who tries to erode the monopoly ends up in conflict with the [US] empire.\"</p> <p>In the past, Molina said foreign oil firms were paying only 3% royalties to the government, but Ch\u00e1vez pushed this up to 16%. He also helped to raise the value of the output from the Orinoco Belt by relabelling it as valuable heavy crude instead of cheap bitumin or tar, as it had previously been priced.</p> <p>Some accuse the US and multinationals of trying to influence the presidential campaign. \"Transnationals want control of the oil here. They want the submission of Latin America to supply the market needs of the US,\" said Nicmer Evans, a political science professor at the Central University of Venezuela.</p> <p>But the outside influence cuts both ways. Since 2007, the government has received $42.5bn in loans from the China Development Bank, with the biggest tranche coming in the year ahead of an election in which Ch\u00e1vez has increased public spending, the minimum wage and pensions. This is repaid largely through shipments of 430,000 barrels of crude a day to China in repayment.</p> <p>Russian president Vladimir Putin showed his support with the gift of a puppy to Ch\u00e1vez this month.</p> <p>But geopolitics is not the only factor at play in deciding who gets to exploit and use this pool of oil. Geography, market demand and refining technology are also help to explain why the US \u2013 despite Ch\u00e1vez's rhetoric \u2013 remains Venezuela's biggest customer.</p> <p>The scale of the required investment will also be a struggle for any single country. Ch\u00e1vez has said Venezuela should look to the country's Faja oil belt and promised to invest $130bn in the region to double national oil production to six billion barrels a day, pushing Venezuela past Iran as the world's second-biggest producer. The money is needed to upgrade wells, processing plants, refineries, docks, roads and housing. Dire maintenance has plagued the industry, most recently with a huge fire at the Amuay refinery.</p> <p>Local people say that the main road between Morichal and Maturin has been cut off at least twice in the past month, once because floods swept away a bridge and once because of a protest by nearby residents against power shortages.</p>",
  "<h2>Graham Duncan is head of affordable housing regulation and investment at the <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/corporate/\" title=\"\">Department for Communities and Local Government</a></h2> <p><strong>The big difference is not the level of discount:</strong> It is the commitment to use the additional receipts from the right-to-buy sales for replacement new affordable rented housing.

In some areas, we expect receipts to be high enough to fund more than one replacement home, in other areas it will be less.</p> <p><strong>It's too early to read much into low take-up rates:</strong> The main reason that sales haven't yet rocketed is that the scheme was only introduced in April. The feedback we've had from many authorities is that there has been a considerable increase in applications, though this obviously varies from area to area. But it takes time to buy a home, even if you're not in a chain, so we wouldn't have expected a big spike in the months immediately after the announcement.</p> <p><strong>Tenant freedoms: </strong>The government believes that former social tenants who have bought their homes under the right-to-buy should have the same freedoms as any other homeowner. Imposing restrictions on the letting of their homes could limit their ability to pursue employment opportunities and to buy larger homes to accommodate growing families.</p> <p><strong>Knowledge barrier: </strong>Many tenants don't know what the right-to-buy could offer them. There will be tenants for whom it is a fantastic opportunity but who do not know enough to take advantage of it.

Just because only one in 25 families who have expressed interest have completed their purchase does not mean that the other 24 are not progressing their sale.</p> <h2>Donald Urquhart is head of housing and community safety at <a href=\"http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/home/home.asp\" title=\"\">Aberdeen city council</a></h2> <p><strong>Looking at the wider issues: </strong>There is too much focus on singular issues such as right-to-buy and not enough on whether the housing system is still fit for purpose given the enormous changes that have taken place: globalisation, mobility of labour, the EU and the internet. We still retain a command and control system based around local authority areas. The system is not fit for purpose and needs to be rebuilt with strong leadership and vision</p> <h2>Ken Jones is director for housing strategy for the <a href=\"http://www.lbbd.gov.uk/Pages/Home.aspx\" title=\"\">London borough of Barking and Dagenham council</a></h2> <p><strong>Rent increases: </strong>One-for-one replacement will only financially work on the basis of the new home being rented at or close to 80% of market, that is the affordable rent product. Nationally, we will not be replacing social or target rent for social or target rent homes.</p> <p><strong>There is another reason for low take-up:</strong> Since 1980, of the 20,000 council homes sold 17,000 were houses with gardens. The majority of the remaining stock comprise flats. Given that we are carrying out capital investment to much of these blocks, potential applicants are likely to be wary of the contribution they will be required to make towards the costs.</p> <h2>Tom Copley is secretary of the London <a href=\"http://www.labourhousing.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Labour Housing Group</a> and a member of the London Assembly</h2> <p><strong>Right-to-buy homes into the hands of private landlords:</strong> The private rented sector has canibalised both the social rented and owner occupied markets. Private landlords tend not to invest in building new homes, so an increase in the size of the private rented sector comes at the expense of the social rented and owner occupied sectors.</p> <p><strong>Councils need more say over what they sell and when: </strong>And there should be an end to discounts. You might term this 'opportunity to buy' rather than right to buy</p> <p><strong>Equity stakes: </strong>We should also look at allowing councils to keep an equity stake in each home sold, recognising that these homes were built and paid for with taxpayers' money.</p> <h2>Patrick McCarthy is deputy chief executive at <a href=\"http://www.wphomes.org.uk/home.aspx\" title=\"\">Wirral Partnership Homes</a></h2> <p><strong>LSVT landlords:</strong> As a large-scale voluntary transfer landlord, the issue is further complicated by the fact that we share our receipt with our transferring council, reducing our net receipt further. Currently we would need to sell more than three properties under right-to-buy to get sufficient funds to replace one. There is no prospect of one-for-one<strong> </strong>in my area of the country with our relatively low property values and high discounts. If there is to be no national redistribution mechanism, then it's difficult to see how there could be.</p> <h2>Kathy Ellis is business strategist at <a href=\"http://www.affinitysutton.com/\" title=\"\">Affinity Sutton</a></h2> <p><strong>Net loss:</strong> One-for-one replacement based on the number of units sold under right-to-buy could still result in a net loss of social housing if the replacement properties are smaller have lower occupancy. The sale of a three-bedroom family house should be replaced on a like-for-like basis, and not with a one-bedroom flat.</p> <p><em>To view the full discussion, </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2012/sep/27/live-discussion-revived-right-to-buy?commentpage=all#start-of-comments\" title=\"\"><em>click here</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for debate, analysis and </strong><a href=\"http://housingjobs.theguardian.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>the latest jobs</strong></a><strong> direct to you</strong></p>",
