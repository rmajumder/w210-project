  "<p>The number of working households forced to rely on housing benefit since the recession began in 2008 has doubled \u2013 a trend that will lead to a million earners being dependent on welfare to keep a roof over their heads by the next election, according to a report.</p> <p>The Home Truths study by the <a href=\"http://www.housing.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Housing Federation</a> found that in May 2012 there were 903,440 working recipients of housing benefits \u2013 more than double the figure for November 2008 and a jump that signifies an alarming rise in in-work poverty.</p> <p>As private rents rise faster than wages, another 10,000 working people a month need housing benefit to afford their rent. By the next election, the study warns, 1.2 million \"strivers\" will only be able to stay in their homes through welfare payments.</p> <p>The federation's analysis is that housing is becoming unaffordable as supply is outpaced by demand. The number of households in Britain is growing three times as fast as the number of homes being built.</p> <p>In England by 2018 the average weekly rent will be \u00a3245, up from today's \u00a3181, a leap of 35%, the study says. The lingering recession means house prices will fall next year but then rise sharply. By 2018 homes in England will cost on average \u00a3292,060, almost \u00a360,000 more than today.</p> <p>The result is that increasingly even those in work will not be able to afford to live in a home without benefits. David Orr, chief executive of the federation, said: \"We now have millions of families struggling to keep on top of their rents, priced out of the housing market, and nearly 10,000 more working families every month are now reliant on housing benefit to help pay their private rent. These people are the strivers the government wants to help, yet their future is looking bleak.\"</p> <p>Orr said ministers' goals to reduce the benefits bill were at risk from the soaring housing market. He called on the government to release publicly owned brownfield land to housing associations to build more houses. Using the government's own data, the federation has identified land equivalent to twice the size of Leicester that could be built on.</p> <p>There is increasing evidence that taxpayers' cash is propping up landlords. An analysis of official statistics for Karen Buck, the Labour MP and a parliamentary expert on welfare, found that between 2011-12 and 2014-15 \u00a335bn of housing benefit will be spent on private landlords, \u00a313bn more than the previous three years.</p> <p>The government said it was \"determined to attract new players to the market and pull out all the stops to get Britain building\".</p> <p>The housing minister, Mark Prisk, said: \"That's why we're offering \u00a310bn in loan guarantees to provide up to 15,000 new homes for rent, putting \u00a319.5bn public and private funding into an affordable homes programme, and why we've identified enough formerly used surplus public sector land to sell for 100,000 new homes. But it's right that we also take action to get the housing benefit bill under control, and under our reforms those on housing benefit can still afford up to a third of homes on the local rental market.\"</p> <p>Labour said the government's housing and economic policies were failing. Jack Dromey, the shadow housing minister, said: \"Millions of families are struggling with housing costs as wages are squeezed and rents go through the roof. But the housing crisis is not just costing tenants more but the taxpayer too. Today we face the prospect of nearly a million working people relying on government support to pay their rent through housing benefit.</p> <p>\"This is the cost of economic failure and shows the disastrous impact of the government's 60% cut of \u00a34bn to Labour's affordable homes programme. With the biggest housing crisis in a generation and the longest double-dip recession since the war, a major house-building programme is essential to build badly needed affordable homes, building Britain out of recession.\"</p>",

The St. Louis Cardinals had the San Francisco Giants in a 3-1 series lead going into Friday night, and the Giants had no choice but to start the underwhelming lefty with the overwhelming contract, hoping only to get four or so solid innings from Zito before saying a few prayers and opening up the bullpen doors.</p> <p>Instead, Barry Zito gave the Giants 7 2/3rds scoreless innings, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/20/san-francisco-giants-st-louis-cardinals-nlcs-game-5-live\">the Giants went on to win 5-0</a> and the St. Louis Cardinals had to travel to San Francisco for a Game 6 that they would rather have avoided. The Cardinals are still in control, of course, as they remain just one win away from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/19/detroit-tigers-world-series-new-york-yankees\">facing the Detroit Tigers</a> in a rematch of the <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/usatoday/article/1642871?odyssey=mod|newswell|text|Detroit%20Tigers|s\">2006 World Series</a>. Tonight, they put Chris Carpenter, injured for much of the year, on the hill against the Giants' Ryan Vogelsong, hoping that it doesn't come to a Game 7.</p> <p>Is there such thing as momentum in a postseason series? If so, do the San Francisco Giants now have that? If we were going by sheer narrative, the Giants getting such a miraculous start from Barry Zito would almost guarantee that they would win tonight and at least push a Game 7. They have maybe their best starter on the mound in Vogelsong and will have their fans behind them both today and (they hope) tomorrow. They have all those intangible things this series now, but this is the postseason where <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/15/new-york-yankees-detroit-tigers-derek-jeter\">Captain Intangibles himself went down</a>, so we'll see.</p> <p>After all, the Giants are still a loss away from elimination and the Cardinals have Chris Carpenter and an offense unlikely to be shut out two games in a row. The Giants may not be ready to go quietly, I can't imagine anyone on that roster wants Zito's Friday night start to go to waste, but don't underestimate how little the Cardinals want to see this series go game seven. This? This is a coin-flip game, my friends.</p> <p>So, it's another do or die game tonight. Either the St. Louis Cardinals clinch back-to-back World Series appearances tonight or the San Francisco Giants force a Game 7.

  "<p>The view from Sir Nicolas Bratza's vast, curving windows takes in the skyline of Strasbourg, the European parliament building and, far below, the river Ill flooding east to join the Rhine.</p> <p>Along the riverbank, at the judicial heart of the continent, there is a scattering of single-person tents \u2013 temporary homes for desperate petitioners to the European court of human rights (ECHR). A protest by Turks and Kurds parades outside the court's entrance to denounce Turkey for promoting an alleged torturer to a senior security post in Istanbul, thereby flouting ECHR rulings.</p> <p>For more than 800 million people, the steel and glass building designed by the British architect Richard Rogers is the ultimate focus of their aspiration for justice. After 14 years as the UK's sole judge and a year as president of the court, Bratza is stepping down at the end of this month. His departure is tinged with disappointment.</p> <p>The ECHR's judicial powers extend across 47 member states, stretching from the Caspian Sea to the Straits of Gibraltar and as far north as Iceland. As a signatory to the original European convention of human rights, which was drafted to prevent the recurrence of another Holocaust and safeguard individuals from totalitarian misrule, the UK was a founder of the project.</p> <p>Stirred up by tabloid denunciations and Eurosceptic politicians, British popular sentiment has become increasingly critical of the court. The UK remains one of the most diligent enforcers of convention rights, but it appears to have soured into one of the least appreciative national constituencies.</p> <p>For some, disenchantment began with the 1995 judgment that the UK had violated the right to life of three IRA members shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar. It has escalated over the standoff on prisoners' voting rights and rows over the protracted legal processes for extraditing terror suspects such as Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada.</p> <p>Bratza, 67, was a successful advocate and a crown court recorder before being elected in 1998 as the UK's judge on the ECHR. He is also a high court judge. He became president of the ECHR in 2011.</p> <p>\"The UK complies very well,\" he said. \"Where we find a violation, they correct it. I remain personally hopeful that some solution to this problem [of prisoners' voting rights] that will satisfy the UK parliament and the [ECHR] will be found.\"</p> <p>Italy is one of the worst serial offenders in violating the convention, because of the inordinately long periods it takes to complete trials.</p> <p>On the ECHR's backlog of 138,000 cases, he said: \"The problem is processing them. The court's registry is very hard-working. We have cases coming in from [more than] 40 legal systems. We have to have people from [each] legal system who understand the language.\"</p> <p>Of around 650 staff, 44 are from the UK. Case notes are colour-coded by the year they arrive. Lime green (2012), orange (2011) and yellow (2009) files were visible, piled up on desks and floors in offices along one corridor.</p> <p>Appealing to member states for extra funds to tackle the backlog has not generated much income. \"The UK has not contributed,\" Bratza said. \"The results have been disappointing. Certain newspapers said we were putting out a begging bowl. It's not that. It was to assist the court.\"</p> <p>This year the UK completed its six-month, rotating chairmanship of the Council of Europe, the body that oversees the ECHR. It culminated in the Brighton declaration, a reform programme that refined the concepts of \"subsidiarity\" and the \"margin of appreciation\" \u2013 the leeway given to nation states in their interpretation of convention rights.</p> <p>The ECHR, Bratza ssaid, should be subsidiary to national courts. \"In order for us to accept our subsidiary role, [member states] have to be the primary protectors of convention rights. The problem is that it's a two-sided coin. National states must carry out their functions.</p> <p>\"The UK has an admirable record on compliance and enforcement [of convention rights]. Provided states do their job, our job becomes much easier. We are a safety net.\"</p> <p>The reforms enshrined in the Brighton declaration were steered through by Ken Clarke before he was removed from his job as justice secretary in the recent reshuffle. Does Chris Grayling's appointment mark a sharp handbrake turn?</p> <p>\"I like the UK to play a whole-hearted role in matters European,\" Bratza said. \"I was pleased to hear [the attorney general] Dominic Grieve say in parliament this week that there was no question of leaving the ECHR. The UK leaving would be very damaging.\"</p> <p>The economic crisis may not help relations between London and Strasbourg, he said. \"Where there's a more general economic problem, it inevitably has an impact on protecting human rights. There's risk that human rights become [seen as] a sort of luxury, that we don't need to bother so much, [that] \u2026 we should be more resistant to immigration or other matters which might be a further burden on the economy. There's a risk always with an economic crisis that a society closes in on itself and becomes less open to the idea of human rights. Human rights are not a luxury, they should be fundamental.</p> <p>\"I met Mr Grayling at the chancellor's breakfast this year and urged him to come to Strasbourg to speak to the president of the court. Unfortunately it won't be within my time in office. I think an early discussion would be valuable to him and the court.\"</p> <p>Bratza's greatest frustration is with sections of the British press. \"Whatever we do, some adverse spin is put on news coming out of the court. It's very depressing to see. When I was first elected as president of the ECHR, I would have thought there might be some pleasure on the part of British newspapers. For too long it had been said that ECHR judges didn't know British law.</p> <p>\"But papers focused on the fact that my father was born in Serbia, giving the impression that he was a balalaika player from the streets of Belgrade.\" His father, Milan Bratza, was a distinguished concert violinist.</p> <p>\"They ignored the fact that he was naturalised in 1928 and that I was born and educated in the UK. On my mother's side, there are generations of law lords.</p> <p>\"We feel some of the language used to criticise the court is beyond the pale.\"</p> <p>Asked about his achievements, he listed the ECHR's successes. \"The court has had enormous achievements under every article of the convention: the importance of an effective investigation where there's been a killing, our opposition to the death penalty is a huge feather in the court's cap, protecting private sexual relations, the development of environmental rights, protection of private life from intrusion of the press, protection of press freedom, stopping journalists from being imprisoned for libel \u2026 It is a long list.\"</p> <p>Would he apply for one of the three vacancies for justices advertised this week by the UK's supreme court? \"I have been out of the UK as a judge for 14 years,\" he said. \"So the idea of going back where I would have a maximum of two and a half years [on the bench before retirement] to pick up the threads in the UK \u2026 would not really be advisable. I have made my judicial career here and that's probably where it will end. I have adored it. It's been a wonderful job.\"</p>",
  "<p>There's an old Jewish joke about a long-time married woman seeking to divorce her husband. The judge asks her why the couple suddenly want a divorce, after 61 years. \"Well,\" she shrugs, \"Enough is enough.\" And it felt a little like that watching the BBC split from horse racing on Saturday after 64 years. They bowed out with a casual shrug, and barely a backward glance.</p> <p>I expected more. It was set up to be quite a finale, with Frankel's swansong coinciding with the BBC's \u2013 and the horse at least was afforded due respect. But given the Corporation's propensity for diving into the archives on the slightest pretext, the afternoon was not half as misty-eyed as one would have wished.</p> <p>Channel 4 now holds pretty well all the terrestrial TV rights to horse racing; the Grand National, the Derby, Royal Ascot, the lot. The BBC, I understand, will still cover the Welsh Grand National, but that's not so much an involvement as a conjugal visit.</p> <p>Incidentally, those of you concerned that the BBC's surrender of horse racing will mean an end to the current omnipresence of Clare Balding need not worry. She is to be Channel 4's main racing presenter, as well as being available on various other TV shows, on radio, in newspapers, in magazines, in book form and, I believe, as a takeaway Chinese meal. Indeed, I am told if Clare fails to appear on any media outlet over a 24-hour period, Social Services are instructed to check on her welfare.</p> <p>In view of Clare's elevation to national treasure status, I suppose it was no surprise Saturday afternoon's look back at the BBC's history in horse racing concentrated on the past 14 years, and the Balding double act with Willie Carson. A sweet little sequence, over the Morecambe and Wise song Bring Me Sunshine, was mostly shots of the pair putting on funny hats, Willie giggling, and generally being two feet shorter than his interviewees.</p> <p>Looking at the older clips, it seemed Balding arrived as a presenter almost fully formed. The clips may have been carefully chosen, but she never looked awkward. Reacting is one of the hardest things to do in TV \u2013 just feel the gaucheness watching almost any local TV news programme \u2013 and Clare almost always pulls it off, demonstrating a genuine sense of fun, without being any less of an authoritative presence.</p> <p>She needs all her authority to put the five-times champion jockey Willie right on technical issues, about which he is often a little hazy. On Saturday, Clare was able to enlighten him on whether geldings qualify to run in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe (they don't, although if you're a horse I suspect that's the least of your worries), while Willie revealed the fascinating information that \"geldings can't go out to stud\" \u2013 not, I suppose, without rendering the argument \"this has never happened before\" sadly inadequate.</p> <p>\"I was asked the other day, who is the funniest person I have ever met,\" said Clare, \"and I told them it was you, Willie.\" Willie responded with a line beloved by fans of the gritty crime dramas of director Martin Scorsese, \"How am I funny?\" but disappointingly failed to go into the whole Goodfellas routine, lamely accepting Clare's response: \"You<em> are</em> funny \u2013 in lots of ways.\"</p> <p>The partnership between the two was worth celebrating all right, but I would not have been averse to a little historical perspective as well, what with horse racing having been such a key element of the BBC's history of televising sport.</p> <p>In his autobiography Calling the Horses, the venerable BBC commentator Peter O'Sullevan describes the struggles of the pioneers arriving at Kempton Park in January 1948 when \"involvement in TV racing was as much a hideous nightmare as an exhilarating adventure\". O'Sullevan, once described as the only man alive with a \"hectic drawl,\" has of course been celebrated by the BBC before, but I never tire of hearing the stories, and seeing pictures of the early days of televised racing when, to quote O'Sullevan, \"shadowy black and white images \u2026 were as readily identifiable as white mice in a snowstorm or black mice in a coal mine\".</p> <p>I would have welcomed a little celebration of Frank Bough and David Coleman on big race days, and Des Lynam joshing with Jenny Pitman and others at the Grand National.</p> <p>As it was, the BBC reserved its eulogies for Frankel, with an elegiac montage over the atmospheric new age piano music of Ludovico Einaudi \u2013 thank you Shazam \u2013 and was able to reveal, as its coverage finished, that the victory in the Champion Stakes was indeed Frankel's valediction.</p> <p>And so this chapter in the BBC's history ended, not exactly with a whimper, but with a serious lack of black and white footage. Maybe the Corporation's normally voracious appetite for looking back at its past has been dulled somewhat by recent news stories.</p> <p><em>Sit Down and Cheer, A History of Sport on TV by Martin Kelner is published by Wisden Sports Writing and out now</em></p>",
  "<p>Juan Mata is the player who seemingly has it all. The 24-year-old can already look back on being a world and European champion with Spain and a Champions League winner with Chelsea and it is an understatement that even he might be proud of to suggest that he has travelled a long way in a breathlessly short time. It is where he intends to go next that is rich with possibility.</p> <p>Chelsea no longer feel like mere dark horses for the Premier League title. Their pre-season status was based on them having lagged 25 points off the pace last time out and the requirement to assimilate a fistful of new signings. But the speed at which Roberto Di Matteo's team have found their stride has been startling.</p> <p>The away win over Arsenal at the end of last month served notice of their ambition and this shoot-out success on their return to north London brought confirmation. Chelsea were value for the margin of the victory and their swashbuckling performance, inspired by Mata and his creative midfield colleagues, did more than check Tottenham Hotspur's momentum and deny Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas the result that he craved against his former employers.</p> <p>Mata was asked afterwards whether Chelsea could win the title and the notion did not feel outlandish. It is not only Chelsea's numbers so far that are big and bold; 22 points from an available 24 and four clear of the Manchester clubs at the top of the table. It has been the change in mentality that has given rise to optimism and excitement. \"What has changed is our attitude,\" Di Matteo said. \"We go away and play with the same attitude that we have at home, so we take the initiative. We don't just give it to the opposition. We want to impose ourselves. Who knows where this is going to take us?\"</p> <p>No one at Chelsea will get carried away, least of all Di Matteo, while Mata stressed that it was \"still early\" and the next two months would be \"the most important moments\". It is remembered somewhat bleakly how the club's previous two seasons started with similarly impressive results only for form to fade and the managers to pay. Carlo Ancelotti was sacked at the end of 2010-11 while Villas-Boas was dismissed in March.</p> <p>The reasons to be cheerful, though, felt plentiful on Saturday as Chelsea's players took the acclaim of the travelling support. There had been no panic when Tottenham raised the intensity at the start of the second half to fight back for 2-1; they simply remained composed and fashioned their own revival. \"It was nice to see that we kept believing in our game plan,\" said Di Matteo, who also mentioned the come-from-behind 4-2 home win over Reading in August.</p> <p>Chelsea's creative depth, after the summer spend, is impressive; Frank Lampard, Daniel Sturridge and Victor Moses were only substitutes at White Hart Lane while Di Matteo praised the focus that the players had shown to blot out the distraction of the John Terry racism controversy.</p> <p>The captain was missed as he served part one of his four-match domestic ban; Chelsea were not entirely convincing in defence and they will welcome him back for the Champions League tie at Shakhtar Donetsk on Tuesday. Yet they did more than enough to take the points because of the sheer exuberance of their attacking game.</p> <p>Mata, who played at Euro 2012 and the Olympic Games, has benefited from a rest from international football, even if it stretched a little longer than he would have wanted. The merits of him sitting out the September internationals appeared to be accepted by all parties but Vicente Del Bosque, the Spain manager, omitted him from the fixtures this month. Del Bosque seemed to be making a statement; he would choose when Mata turned up.</p> <p>The unassuming Mata has let his game to do the talking. His clinical finishes against Tottenham brought him to six goals in five appearances for Chelsea and the seamless manner by which he interchanged with the summer signings Eden Hazard and Oscar in the line behind Fernando Torres overwhelmed Tottenham. Ramires, in a deeper midfield role, also excelled. The Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, is as close as he might ever be to the target of fantasy football.</p> <p>\"We are playing more with the ball [this season] and I think it's more enjoyable for me and the team,\" said Mata, who set up the final goal for Sturridge and feels as good as he has done in London. \"If you can win and also play really well, it is the perfect way.\"</p> <p>Tottenham departed shell-shocked, particularly the hapless defenders William Gallas and Kyle Walker. Aaron Lennon and Jermain Defoe were sharp but Villas-Boas's team lacked cohesion and balance. They will have to absorb a body blow. Chelsea, ahead of Sunday's visit of Manchester United, have the licence to dream.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Juan Mata (Chelsea)</p>",
  "<p>Ben Foster, the West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper, has admitted he felt \"sick\" after watching Chris Kirkland being attacked by a Leeds United supporter at Hillsborough on Friday and has called for the hooligan to be jailed for at least six months.</p> <p>A 21-year-old man has since been arrested in Cheltenham on suspicion of assault in relation to the incident with the Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper, who was knocked to the floor in the wake of Michael Tonge scoring Leeds' equaliser in the 1-1 draw. Foster said it was \"scary\" to think that the man could have been carrying a blade. He also said that he wished Kirkland had been in a position to give the perpetrator a \"boot up the arse\".</p> <p>\"It's ridiculous,\" said Foster, who was once competing for the England jersey with Kirkland. \"You saw the guy who interrupted the boat race got six months. If he gets six months, why can't someone who runs on to the pitch and slaps Chris Kirkland in the face get at least that. I hope something serious gets done to him.\"</p> <p>Asked whether Kirkland should have \"flattened\" the hooligan, Foster replied: \"I wish he would [have]. I wish he had stood up and given him a boot up the arse. I was watching [the game] and it made me feel sick. It was horrible. He is not even expecting it. The lad has smacked him in the face. He doesn't know what is happening. That lad could have had a blade. It is ridiculous if you think of it like that. It is a bit scary, to be honest with you. I hope the law comes down heavily.\"</p> <p>Gloucestershire police made the arrest shortly before 1pm on Sundayon Sunday with the suspect having been identified on social media sites on Friday night. A spokesman for Gloucestershire police said: \"The investigation is being led by South Yorkshire police. The man currently remains in police custody.\"</p> <p>The Football Association is also investigating the events at Hillsborough.</p> <p>Dave Jones, the Sheffield Wednesday manager, who was subjected to vile chants from the Leeds supporters in relation to child abuse charges that he was emphatically cleared of in 2000, believes that the time has come for supporters to \"police their own clubs\".</p> <p>\"It's a football match and we're looking at blaming police and stewards because they're not there,\" Jones said. \"He was a hero, he ran in the crowd, they were slapping him on the back, so what do you do about that?</p> <p>\"It's not one person. In this country we seem to end up going with the minority all the time and it's going to take the majority to sort it out and you've got to police your own clubs.</p> <p>\"Do you know what needs to happen? The people that go to the games that are disgusted \u2013 and it's going to be hard \u2013 they are the ones who should walk out and isolate the people there who are doing it or point out who are doing it. Neil [Warnock, the Leeds manager] said I was upset because I didn't win the game but Neil must be deaf and blind because there wasn't just one person chanting the vile chants they were chanting. That's not what football's all about and it took away from what was a really, really good game.\"</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/series/reading-the-riots\" title=\"\">riots</a> that gripped British cities in August 2011 were a graphic manifestation of the most disturbing global trend of our time: the growing gap between rich and poor, between the powerful and powerless, between those with unfettered dreams and hopes and those forced to focus on mere survival.</p> <p>Over the last 50 years the powerful have tightened their grip on \u2013 and their influence over \u2013 the political and economic levers of control. They have grown ever richer and more exploitative at tremendous cost to the powerless and the earthly environment we share.</p> <p>The powerless have been increasingly&#xa0;alienated from decision-making. They have been asked to accept&#xa0;relatively modest lifestyles for themselves while&#xa0;tolerating extreme and obscene consumption by their more&#xa0;fortunate brothers and sisters on the other side of&#xa0;the fence.</p> <p>The 2011 riots laid bare the truth that few human problems are more pressing than halting the slide of young people into absolute disaffection. Have we stopped to understand the factors that drove some young people to go out and riot and loot, while others of similar background \u2013 and facing similar predicaments \u2013 did not?</p> <p>Yes, boredom may have played a part, and the global descent into consumerism, and the economic recession. But these riots did not explicitly echo the common protest themes of human rights, equality and justice. And the violence and looting that took place did not seem to be perpetrated by any identifiable or organised group, with any particular goals besides personal enrichment and breaking societal rules.</p> <p>This situation is not unique to the UK; it is the global trend. At home, in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica\" title=\"\">South Africa</a>, we are experiencing a spate of popular protests \u2013 termed \"service delivery protests\" \u2013 many of them characterised by violence, looting and the destruction of property. Eighteen years since the demise of apartheid, people rightly feel it is unfair for them to accept their marginalisation forever. Different countries, different contexts; similar causes and outcomes.</p> <p>We need to create space for people to speak to, and listen to, one another. We need to address the factors that divide us before the divisions overwhelm us and tip us into the abyss. Bridging the gaps of understanding between and within our communities will not come from throwing up our hands in dismay and saying it's so complicated and far-fetched that it must be impossible.</p> <p>No. If we abandon our hope that we can build a world in which all people feel&#xa0;dignified, in which all feel they have&#xa0;a role to play and that their contribution is valued, then we are abandoning our faith in humanity.</p> <p>For no matter where we come from or where we live, whether we drive the latest Mercedes or ride the rustiest old bicycle, the simple truth is that we need each other to ensure the survival of our species. We are members of one family, God's family, and we were made for goodness, not for greed. We were made to share, not to hoard. We were made to respect one another and our world.</p> <p>In Britain this week I will participate in an important conversation to examine the causes and effects of the 2011 riots, bringing together people of all&#xa0;ages and backgrounds to articulate their needs and those of their communities.</p> <p>The inter-generational character of the conversation \u2013 marrying the tremendous energy and power of young people to the knowledge and wisdom of adults \u2013 is fundamentally important.</p> <p>Conversation for Change is a key programme of the <a href=\"http://www.tutufoundationuk.org/\" title=\"\">Tutu Foundation UK</a>. We don't expect to turn things around overnight but recognise the importance of affording people a sense of hope \u2013 in themselves, in each other and in their communities.</p> <p>Those who are marginalised from power need constructive mechanisms to articulate their anger and concerns to those who have power and resources.</p> <p>All over the world, including in Britain and South Africa, people feel unable to participate fully in their communities. Indeed, many feel that outside of election periods, nobody really cares.</p> <p>This is not an incurable malaise. Fixing it requires caring and responsive governments to create environments in&#xa0;which unemployment can be reduced, education, healthcare and housing can be improved and cross-cultural understanding can take root.</p> <p>It requires citizens who are active participants in determining their personal and community destinies. It requires societies that understand that failing to act to narrow the disparities in the qualities and expectations of peoples' lives threatens our very existence.</p> <p><em> Conversation for Change takes place on 23&#xa0;October at Fairfield Halls, Croydon. www.tutufoundationuk.org</em></p>",
  "<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: This blog is for people watching the second series of Homeland on Channel 4. Don't read on if you haven't seen episode three \u2013 and if you've seen later episodes, please do not leave spoilers</em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/oct/14/homeland-season-two-episode-two-blog\" title=\"\">Rebecca Nicholson's episode two blog</a></p> <h2>State of Independence</h2> <p>I wrote a short blogpost earlier this week <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2012/oct/15/homeland-lost-the-plot\" title=\"\">about the growing implausibility of Homeland</a>, and whether it's possible to ignore such moments as the text sent from the Pentagon, if it means driving the drama along. For the most part I think it's fine; it's telly. But there were several moments this week that required a Baumgartner-sized leap of faith. Brody's mission to Gettysburg, for example: would he really take his own car? Would he really just stick a cap on his head and hope nobody knew who he was? Would the wife of a senior politician allude to her husband's nightmares and difficulties in the bedroom in a very public forum? Would Carrie be allowed to wander around the CIA into a top-secret debrief wearing nothing more than a visitor's badge? Would Hezbollah really not guess that Saul would back up the memory card?</p> <p>At the moment I'm still with it, just about, but I think the problem is that Homeland has become a bigger show, and this wider focus is showing up its flaws. Series one was about more than two people, but at its heart, it was a game of cat and mouse, and it was focused and sharp. In pulling back to a wider stage and giving the US government and the crisis in the Middle East more central roles, any discrepancies become less believable because the drama is more about these institutions and their games than it is about the characters. That said, now Brody's secret looks set to find its way into the open, I'm optimistic that Homeland will stop bulldozing through the plot without paying much attention to the intelligence of its audience.</p> <h2>Carrie</h2> <p>I enjoyed the glimpse of Carrie Mathieson's possible teenage years in this episode: on her bed at 3.30am headphones on, laptop open, huffing: \"Jesus, Dad, what?\" But this scene also framed a more significant story: that Carrie was becoming coddled in the house that was supposed to be keeping her safe. Her dad was making her food, telling her when to sleep, pointing out when she was wired, but this all added to the enormous despair she felt when the CIA tossed her aside, yet again. When she said she was going home \u2013 that crack in her voice as she said \"in my own bed\" was brilliant \u2013 I didn't expect that she was doing so to try to kill herself.</p> <p>There was a small sense of, not hope exactly, but a small notion that things had been reset, as she got into her party outfit and walked to the door of her apartment. But as she stood in front of the mirror, all dressed up with nowhere to go, it began to unravel. I worried, not just about Carrie, but about where the character was being taken. I don't want the writers to turn her into a Troubled Woman, because we know she's flawed.</p> <p>She's a complicated anti-heroine who still commands respect, and that remains relatively rare on television. Obviously she's deflated after her (excellent) work in Beirut, and obviously the CIA can't take her back. But I want her to be present, as she was last week. She's part of a bigger story and if it gets too insular and too personal, too much about her \"struggle\", then Homeland risks becoming a different kind of show. A relief, then, that she stuck her fingers down her throat, in time for Saul to come calling with that much-needed vindication. For all of the preposterousness elsewhere this week, I found that final \"I was right\" incredibly moving.</p> <h2>Brody</h2> <p>Brody began the episode with a spot of smooching in the kitchen, but it rapidly went downhill from there, as the pull between the two main commitments of his life \u2013 high-level politics and high-level terrorism \u2013 were played out in literal terms. He sacrificed an important speech to fulfil an obligation to Abu Nazir, and in doing so threw away any notion of having a noble purpose. Really his motivation here was to save his own skin, and little did he know that Roya's justification for picking up the Gettysburg vest-maker \u2013 \"he's the one man who knows the truth about you\" \u2013 is no longer the case (nor does it take Abu Nazir into account. Or her. Or the others who must be aware of his allegiances). There was a palpable sense of danger as soon as he went to pick up the tailor, and not just because his \"disguise\" was a bright-red baseball cap.</p> <p>A series of unfortunate events drove this to catastrophe. A burst tyre, needing to stop for petrol \u2013 these gave the tailor the chance to run, and he took it. But it's hard to outrun a marine, even if Brody is more used to life in a suit. What followed was a disorientating sequence in which his political and family commitments came calling, as his secret life careered out of control. The tailor was not going to survive, but to kill him while on the phone to his wife, after talking about their families and daughters, was brutal. He returned home to Jessica inviting good ol' Captain Mike in for a nightcap, and to a complete breakdown of trust. \"You're hiding something,\" she insists. You don't say.</p> <h2>Notes and observations</h2> <p>\u2022 The <a href=\"http://clairedanescryface.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Claire Danes Cry Face Project</a> has got plenty of material to work with from tonight's episode.</p> <p>\u2022 Where has Brody's son gone? Maybe when they find him, they'll find that missing jack.</p> <p>\u2022 I think Jessica's speech was driven by her new Bouffant of Power. That is important political hair, right there.</p> <p>\u2022 Was Brody's log-based tyre-changing technique a marine skill or something he stole from Bear Grylls?</p> <p>\u2022 I'm starting to suspect Roya, the journalist, for no other reason than that it's fun to suspect someone, and Saul is off my list for the time being. Could she be setting Brody up? He's very trusting of her relationship with Abu Nazir and hasn't asked for any proof of it, as far as I'm aware \u2026</p> <p>\u2022 There was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/16/homeland-american-flag-waving\" title=\"\">an interesting blog this week</a> about the politics of Homeland \u2013 and whether it tends to fly the American flag in its portrayal of Middle East politics.

  "<p>In the light of the Jimmy Savile allegations and other child abuse scandals (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/19/jimmy-savile-abuse-of-power?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Editorial</a>, 20 October) readers may be interested to know that the Department for Education is in the process of abolishing the current comprehensive national statutory guidance, <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationDetail/Page1/DCSF-00305-2010\" title=\"\">Working Together to Safeguard Children</a> \u2013 which has been developed and refined over many years as a result of research, reviews and inquiries, and which is used by all agencies \u2013 and is replacing it with a significantly reduced version in the interests of reducing bureaucracy. This new version, as proposed, would, for example, leave local areas to determine their own procedures, including when, and how often, a child should be seen, and does not include any specific definition of \"safeguarding\" or \"child protection\", or how those working with children should be trained to identify and report concerns.

  "<p>It is shameful that our parliamentary democracy may be incapable of getting to the truth about the most serious allegations that can possibly be made against government: complicity in torture and rendition. And disturbing that legislation \u2013 the&#xa0;justice and security bill \u2013 is being pushed through that will stop the truth&#xa0;coming to light. Myself and others have been trying to get an investigation of credible allegations of this, and have been turned away.</p> <p>In 2009 David Cameron said: \"It&#xa0;is&#xa0;vital that we get to the bottom of whether Britain has been complicit in torture, either advertently or inadvertently.\" The&#xa0;new government promised a&#xa0;fresh approach to allegations, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/29/david-cameron-uk-torture-inquiry\" title=\"\">a judicial inquiry under Sir Peter Gibson</a> was then&#xa0;announced. Gibson had been the security services commissioner with&#xa0;responsibility for overseeing their&#xa0;operation since 2006.</p> <p>Subsequently it emerged that the inquiry was to be held in private, without participation by the victims or public scrutiny, and was boycotted by complainants and NGOs. In January this year, the then justice secretary, Ken Clarke, announced that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jan/18/gibson-inquiry-torture-collusion-abandoned\" title=\"\">the Gibson inquiry could not continue</a> because of lengthy police inquiries but that another judicial inquiry would be established once they concluded.</p> <p>In September 2011 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/08/baha-mousa-inquiry-recommendations\" title=\"\">the Baha Mousa inquiry reported</a> that Mousa had died as&#xa0;a result of inhumane treatment, but&#xa0;that report is still the only one into&#xa0;Iraqi prisoner abuse to have concluded. Another <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/19/mod-accused-evidence-iraqi-civilians\" title=\"\">inquiry \u2013 al-Sweady</a> \u2013 concerns alleged unlawful killings in an&#xa0;incident in Iraq in 2004 and has got completely bogged down because of alleged failures by the army to disclose the information sought.</p> <p>A private inquiry by the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/dec/05/ministry-of-defence-courts-martial\" title=\"\">IHAT</a>) to investigate allegations of torture and abuse of Iraqi prisoners is currently in progress. Nearly half of those working for it are reported to have&#xa0;come from the private security firm G4S, and lawyers for the prisoners allege it is a shambles.</p> <p>After Mousa, the head of the army, General Sir Peter Wall, said there was no place for misguided loyalty and all members of the armed forces were invited to report any allegations from Iraq. Nick Mercer, a former lieutenant colonel responsible for giving legal advice to the army, wrote to Wall, advising that he had been made aware of a number of allegations of rendition. These arose when information about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/07/iraq-death-secret-detention-camp\" title=\"\">the death of an Iraqi national in a UK helicopter</a> revealed that at least 64 prisoners were being transported on the helicopter to an unknown \"black site\". The fate of those prisoners is still unknown. Since that revelation, further \"black sites\" have been revealed where prisoners of war and others were taken, seemingly without entering the PoW chain. IHAT took down the details Mercer supplied, but he was told that it was a \"matter for Gibson\". When he asked why allegations of rendition were not going to be investigated by the police (as they constitute a potential war crime), no answer was forthcoming.</p> <p>During the proceedings that former Guant\u00e1namo detainees brought against the government, documents were disclosed that contained proof of complicity in the unlawful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/15/rendition-jack-straw-martin-ubanga\" title=\"\">rendition from Zambia in early 2002 of Martin Mubanga</a>. It was clear that the Foreign Office Consular Division was ordered by No 10 to breach its policy and refuse a British citizen consular protection. This was precisely because the Zambian authorities would have handed Mubanga over to the British security services, which could have saved him from rendition to Guant\u00e1namo. A complaint was made to the police, and this was considered by a panel on which sat Keir Starmer, the director of public prosecutions, and senior police officers. In August, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley stated that the police would not investigate Mubanga's rendition because of criteria adopted by the panel.</p> <p>These were whether there was a significant risk that any evidence would not be available or would be weakened before \"the detainee inquiry\", or whether the allegation was so serious that it was in the public interest to investigate it now. In his letter, Rowley acknowledged that the Gibson inquiry had been \"suspended\" \u2013 it has in fact been terminated altogether \u2013 and referred to his expectation that a \"public inquiry\" will examine the evidence about Mubanga's rendition. But Gibson was not a public inquiry, and there is no proposal for one to be held.</p> <p>It is unprecedented for the police and the Crown Prosecution Service, which are independent, to refuse to investigate a serious offence on the grounds that a private inquiry, which does not comply with standards of international law, will do so in the far distant future.</p> <p>In 20, 30 or 40 years, some future government will be apologising for serious misdemeanours, in the style of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/hillsborough-disaster\" title=\"\">Hillsborough</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/bloodysunday\" title=\"\">Bloody Sunday</a>. Perhaps we will not even be alive to see it.</p> <p>During his time in the army Mercer discovered that the Ministry of Defence was not averse to bringing in regulations to prevent judgments being made against it. I am only too aware that I would not have the evidence about Mubanga's rendition if the new law applied. The continuing attempt to get&#xa0;the closed material and secret court&#xa0;provisions of the justice and security bill&#xa0;passed means that the government is now committed to a cover-up \u2013 precisely the opposite of what Cameron promised in 2010.</p>",
  "<p>England Under 21 v Serbia. Terry v Ferdinand. Su\u00e1rez v Evra. Is racism and football a particular problem?</p> <p>Two schools. One says that there is something about football crowds that brings out the worst in them and the players: the testosterone; the tribalism. And we have addressed the phenomenon in the past of kneejerk racism: that affliction that means otherwise decent people, folk who might strike up a friendly chat at the bus stop, say horrendous things when the blood is up and the pressure is on. Throw in the tension and the testosterone and the tribalism and perhaps that's why things get ugly.</p> <p>But there is another view. It says it's not anything particular to football. It's football as a mirror. Football attracting a cross section and shining a light on the dark side of life as we live it. No distortion, no refraction; just what's beneath brought to light. The former is easier to stomach than the latter.</p> <p>We've heard about the outrages involving big stars in big stadiums, but in the background there has been an interesting case in Grimsby. A diehard fan, a mother of three called Karen Stevens, hurled racist abuse in March at Aswad Thomas, a black defender then plying his trade for Essex side Braintree. She was charged, but the wheels of justice wind slowly. In the interim, Thomas signed for her team, Grimsby.</p> <p>This meant that by the time the case reached court, she was able to proclaim that she had met the player, made peace with the club and, that by reaching private consensus, had rendered any further state involvement uneccessary. \"The player is all right about it,\" <a href=\"http://www.thisisgrimsby.co.uk/Grimsby-Town-fan-Karen-Stevens-faces-anxious-wait/story-16711931-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">she told the Grimsby Telegraph</a> as the legal reckoning approached. \"He tweets me all the time.\" But this wasn't how Thomas saw things, or Grimsby Town for that matter. Come the big day, having admitted a racially aggravated public order offence, <a href=\"http://www.thisisgrimsby.co.uk/year-ban-racist-fan-abused-player-Grimsby-Town/story-16788652-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">Stevens was sentenced to 200 hours' community service and banned from watching football, Grimsby or England, for three years</a>. I've said sorry, I've sorted it out, she said. But this was to profoundly misunderstand her position. She offended Thomas and that was bad enough, but her offence was a crime against society. It wasn't for him to wish away even had he wanted to. Sorry can be too little too late.</p>",

I expect the same thing when Cameron's latest \"<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2220757/David-Cameron-PM-promises-seek-retribution-law-breakers-new-anti-crime-crackdown.html\" title=\"\">Mug a Hoodie</a>\" anti-crime crackdown sees the light of day this week.</p> <p>For the first time political editors of pro-Tory papers are reporting that Conservative MPs going well beyond the usual suspects now regard Cameron as a political liability, a potential loser. Yet the cries of \"Boris, Boris\" are in vain. Sir Mophead is stuck in his London castle, unable to reach Westminster in time. How much worse can it get? Short of Cameron being caught on camera stealing puppies from orphans and shooting them for fun, it's hard to see.</p> <p>Meanwhile the biggest under-reported story of the weekend was surely the London, Glasgow and Belfast <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/20/trade-unions-march-against-cuts\" title=\"\">marches and rallies against the cuts</a>, which saw nurses, teachers, doctors, community groups, pensioners and others coming onto the streets in big numbers \u2013 at least 100,000 in London.</p> <p>True, Ed Miliband was booed when he said there would be further austerity under Labour \u2013 but this was useful for him, rather than the reverse. He went, he told the truth, he didn't just say what people wanted him to hear; but he also felt and listened to a few of the vast numbers of ordinary Britons who are hurting and who are too rarely heard in the introverted Westminster and media bubble. This is presumably why Miliband came into politics; this is what Labour is for; and it must have been a rejuvenating moment.</p> <p>And yet this autumn is probably the point of maximum danger for Labour. It's exactly the time not to relax. For all is not as it seems. What matters most for Cameron and Osborne is the economy. And there are indeed the first small shoots of recovery, if the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/17/uk-unemployment-falls-lowest-ons\" title=\"\">unemployment</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/16/uk-inflation-lowest-since-november-2009\" title=\"\">inflation figures</a> are anything to go by. We have to be cautious. Labour always has to remind us that any recovery is later and smaller than it would have been had the coalition made better economic judgments. But Labour cannot now assume that the country will feel despairing in 2015.</p> <p>Cameron has proved a far less capable prime minister than he seemed during his first year in office. He doesn't appear to have a firm grip. Perhaps those jibes about his laziness are right. He has a Blair-like weakness for instant policy announcements to buy time. He has been stubborn about the wrong things \u2013 Andy Coulson, Mitchell \u2013 and indecisive over things that matter to the Tory heartland, notably Europe. Coalition governments are inevitably fuzzier than single party ones, but Cameron seems to have taken on that fuzziness personally, leaving others, such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, to represent clear Conservative values.</p> <p>Yet Cameron won the Tory leadership and became prime minister for good reasons. He is supremely self-confident and enjoys a fight. He loves power and will do almost anything to keep it. And if the economy is beginning to improve, he will have the bones of a case to make. Between now and the general election, there are two massive political events that could play in his favour.</p> <p>First, there is the continuing unwinding of the eurozone, now complicated by the deteriorating relationship between <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/francois-hollande-angela-merkel-austerity\" title=\"\">Merkel and Hollande</a>, laid bare in last week's Guardian interview. Some major rethinking of powers is now inevitable and that will give Cameron and William Hague their chance. As a pro-European party, Labour will have to be deft and clever not to be caught on the unpopular side of a national argument, or rejecting the people's right to choose.</p> <p>Second, there is the Scottish referendum of 2014. If the Scots vote against independence, many English and Welsh voters will be hostile to further inducements and powers going to Edinburgh as a reward. The only obvious quid pro quo will be fewer Scottish seats still at Westminster, which is bad for Labour. If the Scots vote for independence, of course, it will be harder to upend Tory domination south of the border.</p> <p>Tough times and hard decisions are coming. In politics, this has been a surprising and entertaining few weeks. But nothing revelatory has happened. Nothing fundamental has shifted. What the chief whip really said to a copper, and which ticket the chancellor bought, will soon be relegated to questions in the Christmas quiz pages.</p> <p><a href=\"https://jp.twitter.com/JackieAshley\" title=\"\"><em>Twitter: @jackieashley</em></a></p>",

  "<p>Sex. Women. Friendship. Feminism. Privilege. Race. Nepotism. Bodies. Hype. Talent. When the precociously talented Lena Dunham had to decide on a name for her much-hyped TV series, of which she is the director, writer, producer and star at the age of 26, she settled on a simple and single word: Girls.</p> <p>Yet ever since the first episode aired in the US earlier this year to both ecstatic and outraged reviews, it has sparked passionate debate about a slew of more complicated words, only some of which are listed above. It is hard to think of another show in recent years that has kick-started so much argument, and when the show airs in the UK on Monday, it will do the same here. In fact, it already has. When Dunham spoke to the London <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/magazine/article3555118.ece\" title=\"\">Times</a> earlier this month a reader took interviewer Caitlin Moran to task on Twitter for not raising the already much debated issue with Dunham about why the cast is entirely white. Moran's response that she \"literally couldn't give a shit about it\" prompted fury from some online who claimed that this was a racist response and proof, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/laurie-penny/2012/10/lena-dunham-caitlin-moran-and-problem-unexamined-privilege\" title=\"\">Laurie Penny wrote in the New Statesman</a>, of the \"unexamined privilege\" that saturates too many depictions of the alleged universal female experience. All this from a tweet about an interview about a TV show. Did I mention Girls is a comedy, by the way?</p> <p>On the most basic level, it's surprising that Girls has attracted so much attention because, ultimately, it is part of a familiar genre: a TV show about female friendship set in New York City. From Laverne &amp; Shirley to Cagney &amp; Lacey to Sex and the City to (in regards to 50% of its cast, anyway) Friends, the story of young women making their tentative way in the big city is worn to the point of cliche. Dunham wisely acknowledges this in the pilot episode of Girls by having a poster of Sex and the City in the bedroom of one of the characters so that it becomes part of Girls' background, literally and metaphorically. Like SatC, Girls focuses on the lives of four women: self-involved aspiring writer Hannah (Dunham), uptight but dependable Marnie (Allison Williams), free-spirited and chaotic Jessa (Jemima Kirke) and girlish Shoshanna (Zosia Mamet), all friends and all living in Brooklyn.</p> <p>But despite the structurally generic nature of the programme, ever since HBO announced that comedy kingmaker Judd Apatow had paired up with Dunham to make a show about young women in New York, outsize expectations were placed upon it. Her debut film, the excellent and extraordinarily self-exposing Tiny Furniture, which she directed, wrote and starred in when she was 23, proved that she is a serious talent. Apatow's involvement was seen by many as not just the anointment of Dunham to the comedy A-list but an attempt to rectify his reputation as a purveyor solely of male-centered comedies. Dunham's involvement suggested an overturning of the way young women are invariably presented on US TV: glossy, skinny, perfectly coiffed \u2013 more avatar than human.</p> <p>As Dunham had shown in Tiny Furniture and in the film she made while in college which went viral on YouTube, she is inspiringly unconcerned about showing her non-glossy, non-skinny, non-perfectly coiffed body on screen. Dunham is pretty, but she does not look like the kind of woman who has been featured on American TV for a very, very long time. She looks \u2013 shockingly \u2013 human.</p> <p>Even aside from Dunham and Apatow's professional backgrounds, the fact of Dunham's youth was always going to make this show a target. Anyone who is given such a platform at such a young age will attract both hyperbole and snarkiness, as the news earlier this month that Dunham had received a $3.6m (\u00a32.2m) book deal proved.</p> <p>So, as sure as any TV show about New York will feature elegaic shots of the Manhattan skyline, so praise and rage greeted the debut of Dunham's show in the US. The praise can be summed up as \"this show is groundbreaking, it reflects how women live today\" and the rage pretty much as \"this show is racist and bears no relation to reality\".</p> <p>Neither of these stances is fair. Girls is a very good show: funny and smart, with a script that often sings with emotional truth (if not necessarily credible storylines.) It also features a fantastic turn by Chris O'Dowd in the later episodes. But it is not groundbreaking, and I suspect it will look a lot less groundbreaking to British audiences who, thanks to shows as varied as, say, Spaced and EastEnders, are far more used than their US counterparts to seeing young women on TV looking less than glamorous. In any case, the three other women in Girls are US TV regulation-sized and beautiful, so it's not like we're looking at a full-scale revolution.</p> <p>Dunham, to her great credit, writes her character Hannah as endearing, yes, but occasionally downright unlikable, and this, too, is relatively novel in the context of US TV shows and films. As the American actor and writer Mindy Kaling wrote in her 2011 memoir, Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, if US screenwriters want to make a female lead \"flawed\", the most they'll do is make her a little klutzy. SatC's Carrie Bradshaw might have been useless with money but she always looked perfect and was frequently assured by appreciative lovers of her sexual prowess. Hannah generally looks a state and has terrible sex with terrible men who tell her to stop talking while they take her from behind. Not even SatC's Samantha crossed that sexual rubicon. But in Britain, home of Julia Davis, Jessica Hynes and Tamsin Grieg, it is not quite as novel to see a truly fallible female protagonist on TV.</p> <p>Without question, the world of Girls is a privileged one, a point only underlined by the fact that all four of the leading actors in the show have famous parents in real life. It does not reflect the lives of most young women simply because most young women aren't, unlike the characters in the show, still supported financially by their parents at the age of 24 while chasing their dreams in picturesque Brooklyn. TV critics in particular were prone to insisting on the show's universal relevance (\"<a href=\"http://nymag.com/arts/tv/features/girls-lena-dunham-2012-4/\" title=\"\">[Girls is] for us by us,\" crowed New York magazine</a>), but that's because a lot of US TV critics live in New York and are, I'd wager, middle class. To the majority of the planet, though, while the world of Girls might look less glossy than the world of Sex and the City, it is no less foreign.</p> <p>The outrage over the show's almost wholly white cast points to two different issues: the realism of the show and the desires of the audience.</p> <p>Soon after the show's US debut, blogs with headlines such as \"<a href=\"http://www.racialicious.com/2012/04/19/dear-lena-dunham-i-exist/\" title=\"\">Lena Dunham: I Exist</a>\" and \"<a href=\"http://jezebel.com/5903382/why-we-need-to-keep-talking-about-the-white-girls-on-girls\" title=\"\">Why We Need to Keep Talking about the White Girls on Girls</a>\" mushroomed online. I am a few years older than Dunham but I also grew up in New York and went to a similar school and while the world she presents might seem jarringly white, it is not necessarily untrue. New York is a very ethnically diverse city but, like most of America, it is also a shockingly racially segregated one, born out of the heightened racial awareness that still overshadows the whole of the country. In my class of 50 pupils, there was not a single black student for the first seven years of my education, and hardly any black teachers. When I went to summer camp, the black kids would hang out together in one cabin and everyone else would form their own little cliques. In the world \u2013 the privileged world, no question \u2013 in which I grew up in New York, caucasian was the norm and I didn't, I'm ashamed to say, ever really think about this until I moved to London and this became no longer the case. I'm sure other Americans have had different experiences to mine, but I would say to people who marvel at the whiteness of Dunham's show that it is a lot easier to live in a racially homogenous landscape in America than you might think. Dunham's white world is not right, but that doesn't make it untrue.</p> <p>The popular culture in the two countries reflects this. When my family moved to London in the early 90s, I remember watching EastEnders one night as a means to acquaint myself with this new foreign land. In the episode there was a mixed-race couple (Alan and Carol, for EastEnders historians) and I noticed, amazed, that their ethnic differences weren't mentioned in the script. They merely happened to be mixed race as opposed to their mixed race being a plot point. Compare that with a American show such as ER, in which a white doctor (Alex Kingston) dated a black colleague (Eric LaSalle) and their different races became the defining aspect of their relationship.</p> <p>US TV shows generally feature either an all-white or all-black cast. On the one side, Friends and, on the other, The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Seinfeld and Sex and the City were both set in New York and neither featured any black actors (and when Samantha and Miranda in the latter show dated black men, this difference of ethnicity became plot points, 20 years after EastEnders' Carol and Alan.) This is changing \u2013 The Office: An American Workplace has a mixed-race cast, for example \u2013 and it can only change if people keep making steps. But it's not wholly fair to single Dunham out for failing to do so.</p> <p>Arguments about feminism representing only an elite slice of the female demographic have existed for as long as feminism itself, and there is certainly an argument that Girls is a missed opportunity in this regard. But the show never set out to be a feminist tract, nor a depiction of universal experience. It is about Dunham's own experience, and the fact that so many people expected more, and were then disappointed, reflects how keen \u2013 commendably so \u2013 many people are for pop culture to move forward and reflect a broader spectrum of women's lives. Yet as Dunham says in the pilot episode, she might not be the voice of her generation, but she is \"a voice of a generation\". A funny, smart and exciting voice. Ultimately, it is a credit to Dunham and the potential people see in her that some have been so disappointed.</p> <p>She hasn't made a show that will change feminism, race relations or TV in general. She's just made a show about some girls \u2013 not all girls, just some girls. And, for now, that's enough.</p> <h2>Can a black woman relate to Girls? <br>By Bim Adewunmi</h2> <p>I liked Girls \u2013 it's funny, sometimes poignant, and easier to relate to than many of the stories we've been fed about what it means to be young and female in today's world. It's also a stark, monochromatic white. I recently read a book which explores the same post-university landscape that Girls handles; Jennifer Close's Girls In White Dresses. Like Girls, it is often funny, moving and true to (my and other straight women of a certain age living in a big city) life. I read the stories of these fictional women, laughing and recognising \u2013 and subconsciously searching for a character with a little more melanin than the model on the cover. After finishing it, I wrote that it could easily have been titled 'White Girls In White Dresses'. Similarly, Girls could have comfortably been called White Girls with no change in content.</p> <p>In watching the show, I see situations that could have been plucked out of my and my friends' lives: negotiating the awkwardness of cohabiting, tolerating the beloved-but-boring boyfriends of friends, the howling wolf of being constantly broke at the door, the confusion of what to do with our lives \u2026 but there are also scenes that jarred because I simply couldn't relate to them \u2013 Hannah going to visit her parents with her belongings in a black bin bag (impossible because my mother would have loaned me one of her 20 suitcases), or \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 when one character accidentally smokes crack (I don't smoke).</p> <p>What struck me was that none of the unrelatable stuff was down to my race. Not one scenario. And that made me feel sad because, in a world where I can easily see myself in these women's lives and experiences, the message fed back loud and clear to me is that they cannot see themselves in my skin, my life.</p> <p>Lena Dunham is not exclusively to blame for the lack of diversity in her cast, of course. But she is part of a culture which seems to have no interest in putting non-stereotypical portrayals of people of colour onscreen. I have seen more than one TV writer talk about \"tokenism\" or fear of being inauthentic when it comes to writing black characters, and I'm puzzled. Why are the options so limited? Why is it only 'tokenism' or a gaping absence? And why do they think it's so hard to write a non-white character? We're just people, after all.

  "<p>BP is preparing to announce a $27bn (\u00a317bn) deal that would allow the oil company to extricate itself from a troubled joint venture in Russia, but force it to forge closer ties with the Kremlin.</p> <p>The transaction with Rosneft, the oil company in which the Russian state owns a 75% stake, could be confirmed Mondayand will involve BP selling its stake in the profitable but problematic TNK-BP joint venture it forged in 2003 to the state-controlled company.</p> <p>Under the terms, Rosneft is likely to become the biggest stock market listed oil company in the world while BP will become the second biggest investor in the company after the Russian state.</p> <p>BP is expected to end up with a stake of as much as 20% in Rosneft, securing a major presence in the biggest oil and gas province in the world, and taking at least one seat on the board of the company which is led by an ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>The final details of the much-anticipated deal were being hammered out there was no certainty that all the intricacies \u2013 particularly the politics \u2013 would be ironed out during the trading hours of the London stock market.</p> <p>The transaction is crucial to BP as it provides an exit from the TNK-BP venture which has posed a series of difficulties for the British company, including the departure of Bob Dudley from Russia in 2008 when he was head of the venture. It has required $8bn of investment by BP which in turn has taken out $19bn in dividends. Dudley, now chief executive of BP, <a href=\"ttp://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/18/bp-boss-backs-rosneft-tie-uphttp://\" title=\"\">has told his board</a> that he backs the cash and share deal for the 50% TNK-BP stake which will eventually allow him to hand out billions to BP shareholders.</p> <p>Rosneft is also expected to buy out the other half of the TNK-BP joint venture from the local oligarchs known as AAR, which had previously prevented BP from taking a larger stake in Rosneft.</p> <p>BP will receive between $10bn and $14bn in cash from Rosneft and take shares in the Russian company in which it already owns a 1.25% stake following the partial sell-off in 2006.</p> <p>The Kremlin owns 75% of Rosneft and while there has been speculation that it will reduce its stake to as low as 50% plus one share, this is yet to happen. Igor Shuvalov, Russia's deputy prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/19/kremlin-charm-offensive-bp-rosneft\" title=\"\">said last Friday</a> that the government would consider further privatisation in an attempt to soothe any concerns among BP investors about the influence of the Kremlin over such a crucial part of the UK oil company whose share price is yet to recover from the Deepwater Horizon in the US disaster in April 2010. BP gets a quarter of its production from the existing Russian venture.</p> <p>Dudley's Rosneft counterpart, Igor Sechin, is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/18/igor-sechin-rosneft-kremlin-hard-man-shadows\" title=\"\">a former spy who flew to London last week to take control of the long-running negotiations</a> and whose company has long been attractive to BP. In January 2011 BP and Rosneft announced a share swap to enable them to explore in the Russian Arctic until AAR, BP's existing partner in Russia, blocked the transaction. BP's technical expertise is likely to be essential if the Russian Arctic is to be explored, although this is likely to incur the wrath of environmental campaigners.</p> <p>BP, which declined to comment on Sunday night, is also keen to get more expertise from Russia, a market which produces 10m barrels of crude oil every day, and is considering whether to appoint a Russian national to its board. An announcement on the identity of any new board members is not thought to be imminent.</p>",
  "<p>Peter Hitchens likes to present himself as the Millwall FC of punditry; no one likes him, and he doesn't care. He knows his new book about drugs will go down badly among metropolitan liberals, and says he has \"absolutely no chance whatsoever of influencing anything\". Fleet Street's patron saint of lost causes, he writes: \"Almost certainly the battle to halt the spread of mind-altering drugs is lost.\" And yet for someone confronting futility and derision, he appears remarkably cheerful. \"Well, it's what I've always dreamed of \u2013 of being the kind of person who gets written about. I dreamed of being part of the exciting people who were in the arguments.\"</p> <p>For the guileless pathos of that statement alone, I could forgive Hitchens almost anything. You might say there is much to forgive. Every week in the Mail on Sunday he delivers a thunderous sermon against the moral degradation of all things modern, and his latest book, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/oct/14/narcomania-review-war-never-fought\" title=\"\">The War We Never Fought</a>, makes some jaw-dropping claims. He conflates the scourge of drugs with everything from lottery winners to Oxbridge graduates who haven't heard of <a href=\"http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/mr-micawber\" title=\"\">Mr Micawber</a>, and has a hilarious gift for the waspish afterthought, as in: \"Teachers are no longer really teachers. If they acted as if they are, they would probably be prosecuted\", or police officers no longer patrol the streets, because they're too busy \"suing each other for racial or sexual harassment\". I can think of no other contemporary writer who, when describing a member of the dreaded liberal elite, would add this detail in parenthesis: \"She and her second husband (she is divorced).\"</p> <p>We disagree about almost everything, but I find him impossible to dislike. In person he is polite and engaged, and in print always a contrarian but never a controversialist, sincere in beliefs that are almost as unfashionable on the right as they are anathema to the left. He champions civil liberties but abhors libertarianism, would like to bring back hanging and see off pre-marital sex, and is in a perpetual state of lament for the passing of Christian values, which he dates back to the first world war. \"If anybody else tells me that I think the 1950s were a golden age, I'll strangle them. I remember the 1950s \u2013 chilblains, Wall's ice cream, everybody smoked. I&#xa0;didn't like the 1950s.\" Hitchens's golden age was the late Victorian/early Edwardian era, a period of \"How shall&#xa0;I&#xa0;say? Increasing self-imposed moral conduct.\"</p> <p>The War We Never Fought makes a characteristically counter-intuitive argument. It is nonsense to say the war on drugs has failed, Hitchens contends, when in actual fact we have never even tried to wage it. Drug-taking was, in effect, decriminalised by the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/38/contents\" title=\"\">Misuse of Drugs Act 1971</a>, ever since when the authorities have deployed the rhetoric of toughness to conceal the truth that we are free to take drugs with impunity, knowing our crime will probably be ignored, or at worst not punished but \"treated\". It suits the liberal elite to pretend the draconian rhetoric is true, because it justifies their claim that the law is unjustly repressive and should be abolished altogether. The solution to the alleged failure of the war is not to give up and give in, but to start fighting it.</p> <p>The author's great merit is his honesty. \"Drug-taking,\" Hitchens writes, \"is the purest form of self-indulgence,\" for it severs the link between hard work&#xa0;and reward, making \"deferred gratification appear a waste of time and a foolish rejection of readily available delight\". He regards all forms of self-stupefecation as morally wrong, and unlike others who make the case against drugs on legal or medical grounds is quite candid: this is ultimately, he says, a moral argument. The downside is that once he has stated this position, there is not much more to say. It would barely sustain a column, let alone a book; you either agree with him, or you do not. So he is drawn into making all sorts of arguments based on health, science and judicial statistics, none of which stands up.</p> <p>Hitchens thinks the legal drug classification system, under which cannabis is considered less dangerous than heroin or crack, is \"scientifically meaningless\". Has he ever seen someone trying to give up heroin? \"No, I can't claim to know what it looks like, no.\" Has he ever seen anyone trying to give up cannabis? \"No.\" Does he think the two are equivalent? \"Well, since I haven't seen either of them, I don't know. But as I don't believe in addiction, it's of no interest to me.\"</p> <p>Hitchens thinks there is no such thing as addiction? \"No, it's just laughable. I believe in free will. People take drugs because they enjoy it.\" I agree that many people take drugs such as cannabis because they like it \u2013 but doesn't he wonder why those same people would never dream of touching heroin? Happy, successful, stable people seldom inject smack, whereas most junkies suffered catastrophic childhoods, often in care and often abused. Doesn't that tell us something critically important about the difference between drugs?</p> <p>\"Yeah, but ultimately, so what? All these people would be helped by a properly enforced law which punished them for doing it, because then fewer would do it, and they'd be rescued from it.\" If the horror of heroin addiction is insufficient to deter someone from shooting up, the prospect of being arrested is unlikely to put them off. But&#xa0;Hitchens places unfathomable faith in the power of the law to control&#xa0;human behaviour.</p> <p>He also places great importance on&#xa0;the function of the law to express society's disapproval. How can we expect parents to stop their children taking cannabis, he argues, when the drug's status as \"soft\" \u2013 and by implication therefore harmless \u2013 is enshrined in law? But society disapproves of lots of things, without making them illegal; he isn't calling for marital infidelity to be outlawed, say, so why drugs? \"It's a&#xa0;question of practicality. How would you enforce such a law?\" That's precisely the argument made against drug prohibition. \"But who says it's unenforceable? No one has tried. Possession of drugs is an objective act, possible to prove in a court of law.\" But so is extra-marital sex, when it results in pregnancy; with DNA testing, every adulterous parent could be brought bang to rights. \"Well, I suppose so, but I'm not in favour of that. I don't think that it's a sensible or proper use of policing.\" Which is exactly what people say about the law against cannabis.</p> <p>In an ideal world, Hitchens would outlaw alcohol and tobacco too, but as it is he takes the eminently pragmatic view that both drugs are too entrenched in our culture to be banned. He applauds our laws controlling their sale for achieving valuable harm reduction \u2013 yet when the same principle of harm reduction is applied to other drugs, he is incensed. \"Have you looked at the <a href=\"http://www.talktofrank.com/\" title=\"\">Talk to Frank website</a>? Have you looked at the thing? Financed by you and me!\"</p> <p>Although he does drink, he hasn't been drunk since he was 15. On the other hand, he needs a strong caffeine hit every morning before he can start writing, and drinks coffee while we talk. If a stimulant that \"severs the link between hard work and reward\" is immoral, why is that OK? \"Caffeine? Come on. It's just not a serious point. I&#xa0;mean, come on. Caffeine!\" But that's exactly what people say about cannabis. \"Well, it may be what they would say about it, but it wouldn't be true. There is no case of anybody taking all their clothes off and swimming naked in an English river after drinking coffee.\"</p> <p>If his argument is fundamentally about morals, and he believes all drugs are by definition as bad as each other, their impact on a user's behaviour is logically neither here nor there. But Hitchens cites swimming in a freezing cold river because this was one of the things a friend's son did while in the grip of a psychosis triggered, Hitchens believes, by smoking cannabis. Hitchens is not faking his anguish at the boy's fate; his eyes well with tears as he talks about him. But it's here that his whole argument becomes increasingly inconsistent.</p> <p>Hitchens doesn't believe in addiction, because it cannot be objectively proven by any scientific test. For the same reason, he refuses to recognise other \"modern\" medical conditions such as ADHD or dyslexia, which he dismisses as \"disreputable, unscientific rubbish\". But no objective test exists for schizophrenia and psychosis either, their diagnoses depending upon definitions so subjective that they change according to the whim of whichever doctors are put in charge of making them up. And yet, time and again, Hitchens cites their grave risk as the reason why cannabis should be illegal.</p> <p>\"To say that I can't give you an objective description is not axiomatically to say that they don't exist,\" he protests \u2013 and he may well be right. But that's what people say about dyslexia. \"Well, it may be, but they are wrong.\"</p> <p>Hitchens quotes with approval <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/toby-young\" title=\"\">Toby Young's claim</a> that cannabis did him far more harm than cocaine \u2013 but then dismisses as delusional Young's insistence that cocaine did him no harm. If I were to tell him that I'd taken lots of drugs in my youth, and suffered irreparable mental damage, what would he say? \"I would say: 'What a pity.'\" And if I told him they had done me no harm at all? \"I would say: 'How can you know?'\" Leaving aside the self-evident bias in these responses, by his own logic I might have been much less happy, successful or intelligent had I never taken drugs. \"I accept the possibility,\" he concedes reluctantly. \"But it's bull.\"</p> <p>\"Those who do not wish to&#xa0;listen to the informed and cogent warnings of leading scientists,\" he writes, \"will find excuses not to do so.\" But isn't that exactly what he does, whenever any leading scientist \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/david-nutt\" title=\"\">Professor David Nutt</a>, say \u2013 presents data he doesn't like? \"I do not think that Professor Nutt's statements on the dangers of drugs are cogent,\" Hitchens retorts testily, rather proving the point. He accuses Nutt of \"mixing the subjective with the objective\", but I think a psychologist would probably call this projection. Where is the reputable scientific justification for his insistence that cannabis sends people mad, and is \"one of the most dangerous drugs known to man\"?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398056887\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/19/1350660295324/Peter-and-Christopher-Hit-010.jpg\" alt=\"Peter and Christopher Hitchens, 1999\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Hitchens and his older brother Christopher (left) deep in discussion in 1999. Photograph: Sam Pearce/Camera Press</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Pearce/Camera Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"I'm a propagandist,\" he shrugs.</p> <p>Round and round we go, not getting very far. Hitchens maintains that it's practically impossible to get locked up for possession, and that even dealers are unlucky to wind up in jail. That might come as a surprise to 16% of the prison population. Between 1998 and 2006, the number of people sent to prison for drug offences increased by 91%, whereas the increase for other offenders was just 53%, according to Alex Stevens, professor of criminal justice and author of <a href=\"http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415491044/\" title=\"\">Drugs, Crime and Public Health</a>. Doesn't that sound like a war being waged on drugs?</p> <p>\"Criminal statistics are easy to misread,\" cautions Hitchens, and he is right. But in the absence of any definitive factual consensus, his argument looks more like an article of faith than an empirical thesis.</p> <p>The war on drugs is a lot like abortion, both debates being framed in legal and medical terms, but really motivated by something much more primitive. Hitchens invokes morality, and deserves credit for coming closer to the truth than most, but ultimately I think it boils down not to morals so much as emotions. His position is just as inconsistent, subjective and contradictory as everyone else's, but makes perfect sense as an expression of how he feels about the world.</p> <p>It was Hitchens's defining misfortune, almost 61 years ago, to be born the younger brother of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/christopher-hitchens\" title=\"\">more famous writer Christopher</a>. \"When you're a small child, and you have a brother, you want to catch up with them. I just wanted to be as big as, be as strong as, all the things a younger brother feels.\" Hitchens owed his first job \u2013 in 1973, on the Socialist Worker \u2013 to Christopher's connections, and was a loyal young apprentice to his brother's revolutionary leftwing politics. But he could never compete with his mercurial sibling's legendary charisma, leaving a rightward march back towards their parents' parochial, blimpish politics as the only available alternative. In 1977, he joined the Daily Express, where he toiled away as a worthy if unglamorous reporter until Richard Desmond's arrival propelled him \u2013 a conscientious objector to pornography \u2013 into the arms of the Mail on Sunday and a weekly column where he could be as unlike his&#xa0;brother as humanly possible.</p> <p>If Christopher was louche, hedonistic and iconoclastic, Hitchens would be fastidious, puritanical and Christian. Why else would his latest book condemn rock music as tantamount to a narcotic, \"sometimes a stimulant and sometimes a depressant, but always influential over the moods of its listeners,\" when he must know the same could be said of opera or Elgar? Only his heart, not his head, could write that Toby Young was \"lucky\" not to wind up in a locked psychiatric ward after smoking cannabis, for even the most alarmist interpretation of the medical data does not declare psychosis the most likely consequence. For Hitchens, drugs are really a metaphor for what he calls the \"cultural revolution\" of the 60s, which swept aside what was left of the England he now longs for.</p> <p>Christopher died of cancer last year, after a lifetime of heavy drinking and smoking, but even in death his memory still tends to eclipse his younger brother's presence. \"This is an amazing and unique experience to have an interview in which nobody has brought up my brother until <em>I</em> do it!\" he says, but his laughter sounds more peevish than amused. Christopher had published his memoir only a year before his death. \"One of the problems of having Christopher as a brother is that you felt that the writing about our family was writing about <em>his</em> family. He forgot he was also writing about mine.\" Hitchens would much rather the world did not know that their father drank to excess.</p> <p>The two brothers were never close in adulthood, for along with their politics, their lifestyles also parted company; unlike the twice-married, atheist Christopher, Hitchens is a devout church-going Anglican and lives with his wife and three children in Oxford. But his politics today share something important with the communism of his old revolutionary self. Just as Marxism only makes sense if you believe basic human impulses can be eradicated in the interest of a greater good, the same is true of Hitchens's faith in the power of the law to defeat a basic human instinct for intoxification. \"I'm not a utopian! I'm not a perfectionist!\" he protests, but perhaps a touch too much. As with most of his political positions, his argument for a drugs prohibition makes sense \u2013 as long as you have never met an actual human being.</p> <p>I ask him if he has ever broken the law himself. \"Oh yes,\" he replies, as quick as a flash, he often broke it during revolutionary protests in his youth. Why didn't the threat of penalty deter him? He thinks for a moment. \"When I was in my law-breaking phase I was the kind of person who should have been locked up. I was the kind of person who should be locked up, and possibly strung up. It would have been the only language I&#xa0;understood.\"</p> <p>I ask why he thinks people always say he is humourless, when it seems to me that while he is certainly irony-free, he can be very funny. \"Hmm, probably unintentionally,\" he murmurs. \"I have no sense of humour. You know that.\"</p> <p>I don't think he believes that for a minute. \"Oh, I'm a horrible, brutal, sexist, racist, homophobic monster.\" That's not a self-appraisal but a self-defence mechanism, isn't it?</p> <p>\"Well, there you are then. Alternatively, none of that is true.\"</p>",
  "<p>Britain has reached new heights in teenage hatred. We've gone from \"hug a hoodie\" to <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2220757/David-Cameron-PM-promises-seek-retribution-law-breakers-new-anti-crime-crackdown.html\" title=\"\">\"mug a hoodie\" in headlines</a> over the weekend. What prompted them is that David Cameron is going to give a speech outlining his new attitude to crime and order, with the catchphrase <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/21/david-cameron-law-and-order\" title=\"\">\"Tough but intelligent\"</a>.</p> <p>We were both speaking at the Centre for Social Justice Conference in June 2006 when he gave his speech about modifying our attitude to young offenders. He referred to robust management combined with reparation and, yes, that dreaded word \"love\". The media spun it into the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/jul/09/conservatives.ukcrime\" title=\"\">\"hug a hoodie\" catchphrase</a> that was wrongly attributed to him.</p> <p>The prime minister's attempt to be more subtle about the approach to young offenders was motivated by his awareness of Iain Duncan Smith's work in relation to the implications of childhood maltreatment on brain development. Scientists were becoming increasingly aware of the significance of loving care in sculpting the brain's management of behaviour. The prefrontal cortex responsible for pro-social behaviour acquires its capacities according to how much attuned care an individual has received, hence the appropriateness of love in the context of crime prevention.</p> <p>We need to be tough on crime and its causes, but the question is how morally brave can a prime minister be? The role of a good leader is to identify a social philosophy, clearly articulate the problem, and generate solutions that may not be popular. At times leaders have to carry the anger and disbelief of their followers until the evidence of their good choice changes perspectives.</p> <p>It looked as if Cameron was going to be morally courageous. He was telling us we were walking into austerity and was suggesting we needed to approach our most disturbed young people with balanced interventions, which included tenderness towards them.</p> <p>As anxieties grow about the government's reputation, there may be a propensity to give in to the crowd for popularity. Leaders who short-change their philosophical vision always end up losing even if, in the short term, they're elevated in the polls. So what might the intelligent solution be?</p> <p>Under numerous governments, reoffending rates \u2013 either through custody or community sentences \u2013 have been averaging about 80% within two years. Undoubtedly, our approach isn't working. The natural response is to be tougher which, invariably, translates as enhancing legitimate revenge. So we're told inmates should have their TVs withdrawn and community sentencing should involve an aspect of degrading the criminal.</p> <p>But who is this criminal? Mentally ill people, addicts, individuals who, through lack of care, have developed personality disorders, those with hidden head injuries, those who have been sexually and physically abused, and those with learning disabilities constitute the majority of our offenders. Only a small percentage of those in our criminal justice system are pathologically dangerous or psychopathic.</p> <p>Kids Company operates centres to which 97% of children self-refer; 82% arrive criminally involved. We don't refer to them as \"criminals\", we recognise them as being children in need. Once their complex life issues have been addressed, they rarely reoffend. We have collaborated with UCL, the Anna Freud Centre, Cambridge University and the Institute of Psychiatry, among others, and preliminary results show children who were assessed presented not only with shocking life adversities \u2013 one in five had been shot at and/or stabbed \u2013 but also had neurophysiological damage secondary to the maltreatment.</p> <p>The question is: who should we be tough on? It is not accidental that more than 90% of prisoners have mental health difficulties and have been abused as children. Meanwhile, how do you explain <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-19993994\" title=\"\">Birmingham city council failing its child protection inspection</a> last week?

Well, there are a few revelations to put a spin on things, and Emily's life is too messed up to allow for a truly happy ending. She has to face White Hair, who has taken Nolan, and there are (finally) some truths to be told. Oh, and you can bet it ends with a cliffhanger. <em>Phelim O'Neill</em></p> <h2>Girls<br>10pm, Sky Atlantic<br></h2> <p>Finally, we can see what the internet has been talking about for months. Lena Dunham is Hannah, a middle-class twentysomething trying to make her way in New York on handouts from her parents. \"I could be a drug addict \u2013 do you know how lucky you are?\" says Hannah as they decide to drag the financial rug from under her. It's honest, often painfully so, which might irritate some because Dunham is writing this as a 24-year-old, in the midst of it all. She hasn't learned a lot yet; she's just telling you about the pitfalls as she tumbles headlong into them. Truly refreshing television. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <h2>Rolf's Animal Clinic<br>8pm, Channel 5<br></h2> <p>Arnie is \"a big dog with a big problem\". Namely, two curved hind legs that have left with him with hip problems and a dreadful limp. It's up to staff at the University Of Liverpool's School Of Veterinary Science campus to put it right. In this new series, Saint Rolf Of Assisi looks at the work of the Cheshire-based practice, who don't just deal with regular domestic pets, healing everything from thoroughbred horses to alpacas with flaky skin. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Order And Disorder With Jim Al-Khalili<br>9pm, BBC4<br></h2> <p>Professor Jim Al-Khalili has a track record of presenting ambitious programmes that explain difficult science in terms the average viewer can understand. Here he looks at the concept of information. From early writing systems, which first allowed abstract thinking to endure outside the brain, he traces its development through to punch cards, morse code and modern computing, revealing how information allows a simple system to elucidate something much more complicated. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398067677\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350667412922/-Jonny-Lee-Miller-as-Holm-008.jpg\" alt=\" Jonny Lee Miller as Holmes and Lucy Liu as Watson in Elementary\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> Jonny Lee Miller as Holmes and Lucy Liu as Watson in Elementary.

Liu and Miller are great fun together but the set-up is weak: Sherlock's dad hires ex-surgeon Joan Watson as his son's post-rehab \"sober companion\". Is that a thing? Miller's detective intently and flamboyantly deduces things in a way that Americans might find cute but won't really dazzle the Cumberbores. Tonight the duo search for a missing-possibly-dead New York woman. <em>JNR</em></p> <h2>Fresh Meat<br>10pm, Channel 4<br></h2> <p>The students' thoughts turn to networking, and Kingsley catches the eye of BP executives at a careers fair. Howard's jealous, so decides he needs a new image, the results of which are accurately described by Vod as a \"sort of special needs line dancer vibe\". Not to be outdone, JP comes up with an idea for a new invention and pays some less fortunate students to work on it. Back at the house, an increasingly potty-mouthed Josie gets annoyed at the amount of time Heather is spending with Kingsley. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>Golden Oldies<br>10.35pm, BBC1<br></h2> <p>There are no ambitions more paradoxical than old age: everybody aspires to it, yet everybody imagines that it will be ghastly. One way or the other, however, more and more of us will enjoy or endure it: 20% of us should reach our 100th birthday. This compassionate, understated film introduces three people who have got there ahead of most of us: octogenarian widow Doris, former merchant seaman Francis, and Kitty, a lifelong council tenant plagued by hideous neighbours. All three regard the dying of the light and its attendant isolation, vulnerability and decline with weary stoicism. What else is there to do? <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>Painting The Queen \u2013 A Portrait Of Her Majesty<br>10.45pm, BBC4<br></h2> <p>Thanks to the curious twists of history, Elizabeth II is the head of state in Canada. Hence, for diamond jubilee year, the Canucks decided to commission a new portrait of Her Maj, with Toronto-based artist Phil Richards getting the job. Richards is a man who believes routine provides a basis for creativity, and even his wife apparently thinks he's \"the most boring man in the world\", so don't expect artistic tantrums. Instead, this is a slow-moving documentary that captures Richards's painstaking working methods. <em>JW</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <h2>The Removal Men<br>8pm, Channel 5<br></h2> <p>\"This is a straightforward job for the lads,\" says Jane Horrocks in her phoned-in narration, describing the house move \u2013 from Dorset to Wales \u2013 of a dog-mad couple with two Newfoundlands and more pugs than they know what to do with. Such a remark begs the question: then why in God's name is it interesting? Well, it's not, but The Removal Men carries on regardless, a 43-minute advert for Pickfords Removals, a bit like Channel 5's similar Eddie Stobart-based series about lorries. Toweringly dull. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>Tales From The Wild Wood<br>8.30pm, BBC4<br></h2> <p>Rob Penn's assignment in this charming series is to try to tame Strawberry Cottage Wood, 50 acres of south Wales that has lain unmanaged for half a century. This week, Rob admires how his borrowed pigs have cleared a large patch of dense bracken, and tries to find a commercial way forward for his supply of wood. In the past, Sussex woods specialised in supplying clog makers and Hampshire ones in selling fence posts. For his, Rob is exploring the fuel business, but also learning about the healing power of wooded areas, aided by soulful wood-dweller Iliff Simey. <em>JR</em></p> <h2>Unsafe Sex In The City<br>9pm, BBC3<br></h2> <p>Well, this isn't a show for the faint-hearted. Cameras follow the jolly staff of Manchester Royal Infirmary's STI clinic as they swab, probe and examine patients who are facing the consequences of unprotected sex. Rampant Courtney is confident she doesn't have HIV as she \"doesn't sleep with anyone who isn't from this country\", while escort Tim relies on regular HIV tests instead of condoms. Never mind STIs, many of the patients here are riddled with ignorance, so it's no surprise that the squeamish factor makes Embarrassing Bodies look like Waybuloo. <em>HV</em></p> <h2>Chicago Fire<br>9pm, Sky Living<br></h2> <p>One of the producers of Law &amp; Order and another from The Wire are behind this new firehouse drama set in \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 the Windy City, which, when you're talking about fires, must make the job more hazardous. The drama hits the ground running, with this pilot opening after the death of Andy Darden, one of the firefighters' own, ushering in lots of blame and soul-searching. Chiselled Kelly Severide (Taylor Kinney) locks horns with House's Jesse Spencer over whose fault it was; you know they'll end up having a big man-cuddle. <em>BA</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398067678\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350667686797/Brazil-with-Michael-Palin-008.jpg\" alt=\"Brazil with Michael Palin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Palin in Brazil. Photograph: Basil Pao/BBC/Prominent Productions</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Basil Pao/BBC/Prominent Productions/Basil Pao</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Brazil With Michael Palin<br>9pm, BBC1<br></h2> <p>Not to be confused, of course, with Terry Gilliam's Brazil (with Michael Palin). Despite 25 years of travel documentaries, it's taken until now for the Beeb's favourite globetrotter to visit the fifth largest nation on earth. Little surprise then that Palin gets straight to work here, leaping into street carnivals, bull baptism ceremonies, and cajoling a <em>pai-de-santo</em> into predicting England's World Cup chances. Palin brings his avuncular charm to it all, and if it's not quite as captivating as 80 Days just yet, an hour spent with The Nice Python is never wasted. <em>Mark Jones</em></p> <h2>Sam Mendes: Licence To Thrill \u2013 A Culture Show Special<br>10pm, BBC2<br></h2> <p>With Skyfall about to hit cinemas, Bond is back in the guise of Daniel Craig, a man with an even harder stare than Paddington Bear. This is, of course, terrific news. What still doesn't quite compute is the idea of serious Sam Mendes helming a 007 flick. Why did he take the gig? It's a question Mark Kermode will no doubt ask as he interviews the director for a Culture Show special that also reflects on the enviably glittery theatre and film career of a man who famously bagged an Academy Award for his first feature, American Beauty. <em>JW</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <h2>The Town That Caught Tourette's<br>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Last year, students in the small town of Le Roy in New York State suddenly began exhibiting Tourette's-like symptoms. This documentary tells the story of the epidemic, which manifested itself in facial twitching and body tics. Doctors diagnosed conversion disorder, which is caused by psychological factors, but many parents wanted a physical cause: a chemical spillage and a rare virus were two contenders. As the media took up the story and campaigners got involved, the condition's cause remained elusive. <em>MS</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398067679\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350667971038/Kevin-Costner-and-Sarah-P-008.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Costner and Sarah Parish in The Hatfields and the McCoys\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Costner and Sarah Parish in The Hatfields and the McCoys. Photograph: Chris Large </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Large</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Hatfields &amp; McCoys<br>9pm, Channel 5<br></h2> <p>A big budget, a glittering cast and some sprawling ambition underpin director Kevin Reynolds's three-part mini-series concerning the real-life feud between two families. Kevin Costner and Bill Paxton star as the heads of these bloodthirsty clans as they let their differences spiral into malodorous violence in post-civil war Kentucky and Virginia. This feature-length pilot is grimy, but still it's shamelessly watchable, with great support from Powers Boothe and Ronan Vibert, and a disarmingly fine turn from Michael Greco, formerly of Albert Square. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>Scandal<br>9pm, More4<br></h2> <p>This new series from Grey's Anatomy creator Shonda Rhimes stars Kerry Washington as fearsome ex-White House communications director Olivia Pope, now heading a team of super-lawyers. They take on the toughest cases and are, as one of Pope's minions puts it, \"Gladiators \u2026 in suits!\" Though Pope is loosely based on the Bush administration's crisis manager Judy Smith (who gets a consultant credit), the show is high camp. Everyone talks really fast, which helps as this opening episode rockets through several plotlines: a murder; a favour for the president; and even a wedding proposal. <em>PO'N</em></p> <h2>Richard E Grant's Hotel Secrets<br>9pm, Sky Atlantic<br></h2> <p>A new series in which the elegant Grant luxuriates in the opportunity to stick his nose into the palatial guesthouses of the rich and famous, a world of remote-controlled toilet seats and rooms in which you could house elephants. It's hardly an expos\u00e9 of inequality: Grant revels in the salubriousness of it all, meeting, among others, Gene Simmons and Donald Trump and delighting at anecdotes about Leona Helmsley, billionaire proprietor of the New York Palace hotel, who was eventually sent down for tax evasion. <em>DS</em></p> <h2>Freaky Sleepers<br>10pm, Channel 4<br></h2> <p>With modern-world stresses leading to fitful nights of semi-slumber for more people than ever, sleep clinics have never been busier. Here we see a sample of the sufferers they're here to help, taking in \u2013 with the aid of night-vision footage \u2013 nocturnal activities such as sleep-texting, sleep-eating, and the bizarre but genuine disorder known as \"sexsomnia\". The nascent practice of sleep medicine faces quite a fight in helping sufferers finally get a decent night's kip, making for an illuminating look at the latest methods available. <em>MJ</em></p> <h2>Brooklyn Bridge<br>10.15pm, PBS America<br></h2> <p>Brooklyn Bridge was the first Ken Burns documentary to be broadcast by PBS, back in 1982. It holds up no less robustly than its subject, however, bringing a sense of marvel to the story of an architectural icon which, when it was opened in 1883, was half as long again as the longest bridge previously built, and the tallest structure on the North American continent. The great American bridge is also a great American story, the brainchild of a German immigrant called John A Roebling, completed by the no less extraordinary son he named Washington. <em>AM</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Friday</h2> <h2>A Wolf Called Storm: Natural World Special<br>9pm, BBC2<br></h2> <p>Cameraman Jeff Turner spends a year in Wood Buffalo Natural Park in north Canada following a pack of wolves as they hunt buffalo and raise their cubs. The wolves, previously featured in Frozen Planet, are led by a formidable male which Turner names Storm. They are able to cover 30 miles a day, even in deep winter snows, so Turner has to rely on a helicopter to track them. He manages to film the pack as they hunt buffalo (which can be 20 times the size of a wolf), including remarkable footage of Storm singlehandedly taking down a bison. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Derren Brown: Apocalypse<br>9pm, Channel 4<br></h2> <p>The power of suggestion has come on a long way from being wedged somewhere between the bingo and the Tom Jones impersonator at the end of the pier variety show. For his latest elaborate trick, the ever-captivating Derren Brown aims to persuade some poor sod that the planet has been devastated by a meteor strike and they're among the last non-flesh-eating survivors of a zombie apocalypse. Obviously. Tonight is the first of two parts; will our hero rise to the cadaverous challenges facing them? BA</p> <h2>Chas &amp; Dave: Last Orders<br>9pm, BBC4<br></h2> <p>Charles Nicholas Hodges and David Victor Peacock occupy a special place on the national jukebox. Even misty-eyed indie kids leave their sense of irony at the door for these two. Yet it's hard to imagine anyone remotely resembling Chas &amp; Dave making such a seismic chart splash ever again. Respected as session musicians long before they conjured up their own brand of \"rockney\", this hour-long profile covers a career-spanning five decades, with walk-on parts from Jerry Lee Lewis and Eminem. <em>AJC</em></p> <h2>Raiders Of The Lost Past<br>9pm, Yesterday<br></h2> <p>The godawful title here suggests a cod history series, full of \"we-may-never-know-but-it's-sure-spooky\" moments. So when the first episode turns out to focus on Hitler's obsession with the Spear Of Destiny, supposedly stabbed into Jesus by Roman centurion Longinus as Christ suffered on the cross, the heart sinks even further. Stick with this, though, as it's actually a fascinating story, bound up with the annexation of Austria, Nazi looting, a vast secret vault beneath Nuremberg, a German \u00e9migr\u00e9 medieval scholar working for the US military, and \"Old Blood And Guts\" General George S Patton.<em> JW</em></p> <h2>A League Of Their Own<br>10pm, Sky1<br></h2> <p>Never knowingly underexposed, James Corden returns to host the sport quiz that you don't necessarily need to know a huge amount about sport to watch. Corden will have his work cut out to hog the limelight on this first show of the series, probably being confined to the long shadows cast by his Olympian guests. Chief among these will be the beaming Mo Farah, while gymnast Louis Smith ups the medal count still further. Among the regular celebs, Claudia Winkleman is onside, while Jack Whitehall continues to successfully balance the amiable and the mildly obnoxious. <em>JR</em></p> <h2>Being Liverpool<br>11.05pm, Channel 5<br></h2> <p>Although it has been revealing about new manager Brendan Rodgers's idiosyncratic style, Being Liverpool has felt at times rather less fly-on-the-wall, more official in-house production. In this, the last of the series, the team look back at the creditable 2-2 home draw they earned against champions Manchester City, assessing the plusses and minuses of their performance. It's probably as well the series ends here as their season has been pretty absymal since; perhaps Being Liverpool offers one or two clues as to why. <em>DS</em></p>",
  "<p>Once it was a journalist's lament that today's newspapers are tomorrow's fish and chip paper, a reflection on the ephemeral nature of news.</p> <p>You won't find yesterday's news in the chippy any more. Where you will find it is in the digital archives of newspapers, and its force is anything but fleeting.</p> <p>The Guardian's digital archive holds more than 1m articles. It's a rich resource of more than a decade's worth of print, podcasts and video material. And it is very popular. Nearly 40% of content viewed on the website is more than 48 hours old. However, all this readily accessible material does bring new difficulties for readers and journalists. I am going to look briefly at three of them.</p> <p>First, judges have started ordering news organisations to remove material from their archives that they believe may prejudice a jury if members see it, for instance background material about an individual or individuals on trial.</p> <p>A judge in one recent high-profile criminal case wrote a confidential letter to the editors of many national newspapers, warning that there was material he thought that might constitute contempt of court on a number of newspaper websites, individual blogs and Wikipedia. And he further warned: \"Internet service providers, bulletin board operators, web hosting services and search engines (such as Google) will need to consider whether they are enabling the publication of this material \u2026 the continued publication of this material on the internet, or elsewhere, prima facie constitutes a contempt of court within section 1 of the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/49\" title=\"\">Contempt of Court Act 1981</a> and it is critical \u2013 particularly given the impending trial \u2013 the order of the court is complied with and the publication of this information ceases immediately.\"</p> <p>Despite a court challenge from one newspaper, an order was made in relation to two articles on the site and these had to come down for the duration of&#xa0;the trial.</p> <p>Newspaper lawyers believe that a judge's instructions to jurors \u2013 that they avoid referring to any material outside what they hear by way of evidence in the courtroom for the length of the trial \u2013 should be enough; that it is practically impossible to retrieve all online material; and that such wide-ranging orders are disproportionate.</p> <p>Another problem involves archived material that gives the most accurate picture of a story at the time it was filed but may turn out to be very wrong within 24 hours.</p> <p>Readers have hitherto accepted that each edition of a newspaper is a snapshot of the available information at the time the newspaper went to press. For instance, estimates of casualties in a catastrophic event, or details about a suspect in a crime, may change as more information becomes available.</p> <p>Where these early iterations of the story remain on the site, the Guardian has relied on the date stamp and time of posting to indicate that this was the state of knowledge at the time it went up on the site. Where we find a story was significantly inaccurate or misleading based on knowledge at the time of publication, we amend the article and publish a footnote to explain the change as well as a published correction.</p> <p>Notwithstanding the technical difficulties of taking those stories down, there is also a strong argument that to do so would be to breach the integrity of the archive, because it is important to know what was known about the event and when.</p> <p>Finally, the continuing problem of deletion requests. In the past, barring a well-founded request based on whether continued publication could endanger life or limb, I have turned down such requests so as to maintain the archive as a historic, accurate record of events.</p> <p>But as the archive grows, so do the requests for deletions, particularly as those recruiting for jobs appear to turn automatically to Google and Facebook as a means to sift candidates.</p> <p>This has attracted the attention of European legislators, who have discussed \"a right to forget\" as part of the reforms within the draft regulations for the European Data Protection framework. This is mainly aimed at social networking sites and there is currently an exemption for journalism. However, the Guardian's deletions procedure will need to be reviewed against the broad principles whatever new policy emerges.</p>",
  "<p>A self-confessed \"civil war nut\", <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/mark-gatiss\" title=\"\">Mark Gatiss</a> was desperate to play <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,,-2800,00.html\" title=\"\">Charles I</a> in <a href=\"http://www.hampsteadtheatre.com/whats-on/2012/55-days/\" title=\"\">55 Days</a>, a new drama about the trial and execution of the monarch by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/nov/14/monarchy-television\" title=\"\">Oliver Cromwell</a>'s revolutionaries.

He said, 'Can you imagine anyone else playing the part?'

It continues a run of appearances that includes his portrayal of a transvestite in the adaptation of the Almod\u00f3var film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/sep/05/theatre1\" title=\"\">All About My Mother</a> at the Old Vic, and an affecting turn as hapless amateur magician Uncle Bernard in Alan Ayckbourn's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/dec/09/seasons-greetings-review\" title=\"\">Season's Greetings</a> at the National.</p> <p>Although he trained as an actor, at Bretton Hall in Yorkshire, Gatiss initially bypassed theatre in favour of TV comedy, as part of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-league-of-gentlemen\" title=\"\">The League of Gentlemen</a>. Is he now making a concentrated attempt at being recognised as a stage actor? \"It&nbsp;wasn't a policy. For some reason, I&nbsp;always get offered plays when I'm doing plays and then, if I stop doing them, people stop asking me. I hadn't intended to book-end the year with theatre, but this is one of my favourite periods, and I've always wanted to play Charles I.\"</p> <p>He auditioned for Channel 4's 2008 civil-war drama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/nov/20/2\" title=\"\">The Devil's Whore</a>, but attributes his failure there to a rare case of an actor having prepared too well. \"I&nbsp;was up to play Cromwell's secretary of state, <a href=\"http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=55221\" title=\"\">John Thurloe</a>. And I foolishly said I actually had a biography of Thurloe. The director looked at me as if to say 'Oh God', and I didn't get the part.\"</p> <p>Gatiss is on his lunchbreak, having spent the morning in director <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/oct/18/howard-davies-director\" title=\"\">Howard Davies</a>'s rehearsal room at the Hampstead theatre in London. It's a poignant venue for Gatiss: in 2009, due to appear here in a play called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/dec/08/darker-shores-review\" title=\"\">Darker Shores</a>, he was forced to withdraw following the death of his sister. He pauses on the stairs to look at posters of past productions featuring <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/video/2010/nov/19/tom-courtenay-conversation-video\" title=\"\">Tom Courtenay</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/alec-guinness\" title=\"\">Alec Guinness</a> and others. Gatiss relishes the sense in theatre, as in monarchy, of a line of progression. \"Less than a month before Season's Greetings, I auditioned for something else at the National and, when I didn't get it, came out properly depressed because I realised how much I wanted to be part of it. At the Old Vic, during All About My Mother, there were pictures of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/olivier\" title=\"\">Olivier</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_TPzPJvsSM\" title=\"\">Richardson</a> in the rehearsal rooms and it was impossible not to think, 'Wow!'\"</p> <p>I'm surprised someone of Gatiss's celebrity still auditions for roles. \"It varies. I was offered this and The Recruiting Officer. I auditioned for Season's Greetings and have no qualms&nbsp;about being asked to. But, having been on the other side of the audition table with Sherlock, the truth is that you just don't know. You're not questioning people's ability \u2013 they may just not be right. And the awful thing is that you can be wrong.\" He laughs. \"As audiences at Hampstead may be about to discover.\"</p> <p>A crucial early decision for Gatiss, who was born in County Durham, was how Charles should sound. \"I'm going for Morningside,\" he says, referring to the area of Edinburgh <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/dec/13/prime-of-miss-jean-brodie\" title=\"\">Miss Jean Brodie</a> came from. \"He lived in Scotland until he was five, too weak to go south. And he had a Scots accent all his life. Who knows what kind? But it seemed to me the rather genteel, supercilious sounds of posh Edinburgh would suit him, with just a little stammer thrown in.\"</p> <p>55 Days is a slightly subversive choice in this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/queen-diamond-jubilee\" title=\"\">diamond-jubilee year</a>, the play being a dramatisation of the start of Britain's eight-year flirtation with republicanism. \"Howard Davies said that a French friend of his said, 'Why do you English never talk about your revolution? You did it first.' And that's true; we've become slightly embarassed about it. When I was at school, there was just a gap on the royal chart. In retrospect, it might have said 'interregnum', but I wouldn't have understood that word. Most people I talk to don't really understand what happened in that period.\"</p> <p>Gatiss is a republican. \"I'm firmly with Cromwell, always have been. But&nbsp;it's terribly muddled in that I'm obsessed with the royal family. I love the Shakespeare history plays, I love the struggle for the crown as a plot. Charles fascinates me. He was so slippery. Some of his speeches to parliament survive, and there are quite a few gags in them. He had a sardonic quality. And even though he was a duplicitous monster, I do admire his martyrdom, because he carried himself with such dignity.\"</p> <p>With the exception of the king, all the characters in 55 Days are in \"vaguely modern dress\", which Gatiss finds useful. It means, he says, \"I'm already isolated, a relic.\" And it's clear from Brenton's script that he sees this as a period in which England was reinventing itself, moving from the republican experiment to the constitutional monarchy we have today, with royals and parliament separate, in theory anyway. Gatiss thinks 55 Days has some contemporary relevance, given <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/12/prince-charles-letters-legal-attempt?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">recent moves by the Guardian and others</a> to expose the&nbsp;royal family's attempts to shape legislation. \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-charles\" title=\"\">Prince Charles</a> has an outrageous amount of influence. For me, [the future] Charles III, although he will probably rule as George VII, is most like Edward VIII. He believes in his right to interfere. The idea that a constitutional monarchy has interference rights seems to me a scandal.\"</p> <p>When 55 Days finishes its run, Gatiss will prepare to play Mycroft Holmes, brother of the sleuth, in three episodes of Sherlock, including one he wrote; meanwhile, the second of his two Doctor Who episodes is, as we speak, being finalised in the editing suite.

The news channel said in a statement that she was attacked at about 10.30pm.</p> <p>Her colleague from the English section of France 24, Ashraf Khalil, was by her side waiting to do his spot next for the camera but cut her off midway and led her off as the crowd began to move in. All this was caught on camera.</p> <p>\"Usually one of us goes first then the other, Sonia does the French and I do the English,\" he told the Guardian. \"Usually we don't do Tahrir live shots from street level, normally we're on a balcony. We had done an earlier live shot and even then the crowd was annoying.</p> <p>\"When we went back for the second live shot the crowd was worse, it was really hard to control the crowd. If you see the video you can see me popping up on the fringe telling people let her work. By the time it was finished everybody was too close and no one was listening to us. I told Sonia to just go straight to [the shop] Hardee's and wait for me because I didn't want her to wait with this crowd of feral youths.\"</p> <p>But the crowd had already begun to close in as Khalil and Dridi made their way to the Hardee's branch at the corner of the square. By the time they made it to the shop Dridi discovered her shirt was open and was grateful that the \"tight thick belt\" she was wearing prevented worse happening.</p> <p>\"More frightened than hurt,\" wrote Dridi in French, according to the Associated Press, on her Twitter page on Saturday. Referring in English to her colleague, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sonia_Dridi/status/259577046802526208\" title=\"\">she tweeted</a>: \"Thanks to @ashrafkhalil for protecting me in #Tahrir last nite.

The Friday before that had seen clashes between members of the Brotherhood and anti-Brotherhood supporters that lasted for hours and resulted in 110 injuries.</p> <p>Numerous incidents of violence and sexual assault against women have been reported over the past 18 months whenever throngs gather in the square, with not everyone necessarily there with the aim of protesting. Sexual harassment is an endemic problem in Egypt dating back to before the revolution.</p> <p>Dridi has filed a police report about the incident and said on her Facebook page: \"The crowd was out of control, [and] some guys took advantage of it. Some people tried to help but it was hard to know who to trust in the heat of the moment.\"</p> <p>Dridi and Khalil's bags were stolen in the ruckus but Dridi's was returned by an Egyptian who managed to wrestle it back.</p> <p>\"What was depressing is that the employees inside Hardee's knew exactly what to do because this seems to happen all the time,\" Khalil said. \"Some terrified woman running in one step ahead of a mob.\" The doors were bolted and later Khalil went out to hail a taxi and made it wait in front of the shop as Dridi was ushered out. Even then, it hadn't ended, with some men taking notice and banging on the hood of the car.</p> <p>\"Sexual harassment is a 20-year problem here, but now there's a feeling of impunity and the knowledge that the police won't do anything about it, it breeds this culture of lawlessness,\" Khalil said. \"There are always good Samaritans in the crowd but crowds can be stupid and when it tips, it tips. [However] there were several other guys who helped and we couldn't have done it without them, we have to remember that.\"</p> <p>At the height of the uprising against Hosni Mubarak, Lara Logan, a correspondent for the US network CBS, was sexually assaulted and beaten in Tahrir Square.</p>",
  "<p>Europe's most senior judge has warned that the government is in danger of undermining human rights legislation and thrown back accusations that the Strasbourg court is responsible for lengthy delays in extradition cases.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian before stepping down as president of the European court of human rights (ECHR) at the end of the month, Sir Nicolas Bratza also says that the government's reluctance to grant prisoners voting rights is \"damaging\".</p> <p>His comments are a robust response to criticism directed at Strasbourg and the ECHR by the home secretary, Theresa May, and the lord chief justice, Lord Judge.</p> <p>In the wake of protracted appeals involving the terror suspects Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada, as well as the alleged computer hacker Gary McKinnon, concern has mounted about cases lasting as long as eight or 10 years.</p> <p>In the Commons last week, May said: \"We will work closely with the European court of human rights on a programme to reduce the wholly unacceptable delays that have occurred there.\"</p> <p>Last month, Judge said legal holdups were \"a source of real fury to me\" and in reference to Hamza added: \"I do not think \u2026 you will discover that the delays in that particular case, or in many like it, are actually to be levelled at the doors of the courts here.\"</p> <p>Speaking in Strasbourg, Bratza said: \"I have read what the lord chief justice has to say about it, where he exonerates his own courts and talks about 'the courts here', and the implication is that perhaps the Strasbourg court is to blame. I don't think that's fair if that's the implication.</p> <p>\"These were cases of considerable complexity. There was great co-operation between the parties. Never once did the UK complain that we were dragging our feet or taking too long. On the contrary, the UK, because of the need to find extensive evidence about supermax prisons, asked for a considerable extension of time to submit information.</p> <p>\"We acceded to that because it was important, but to blame the court for granting an extension that's been requested by the government \u2026 would be unfair. I don't accept for one moment that we were guilty of the substantial delay with which we seem to have been saddled.</p> <p>\"The returning of people to another country whether by deportation or extradition is very difficult.\"</p> <p>The case of Abu Qatada, which is before the UK's special immigration appeals commission (Siac), might return to Strasbourg, he said.</p> <p>The ECHR has accelerated its processing of cases, Bratza said, significantly reducing the notorious backlog. A victim of its own success, the court at one stage had 161,000 cases waiting to be dealt with. \"That figure is declining now and we are making great progress. Now it's down to 138,000.\"</p> <p>By using a single judge system and filtering out inadmissible cases \"this year we have already achieved something like 70,000 cases. That's a phenomenal number of cases resolved. We were always accused of inefficiency. I think the figures disprove that.\" It is estimated that the backlog will be cleared completely by 2015.</p> <p>Bratza also questioned why the coalition had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/feb/16/bill-of-rights-review-imminent-david-cameron\" title=\"\">launched a bill of rights commission</a> to review the UK's obligations under the European convention on human rights. The commission is due to report by the end of the year. Eurosceptics hope it will dilute the Human Rights Act, while civil liberties groups are satisfied with the status quo.</p> <p>\"My problem is understanding why it's desirable to introduce a new bill of rights into law,\" said Bratza. \"The [existing] Human Rights Act is an extremely skilful piece of legislation which does strike exactly the right balance.</p> <p>\"The [UK] courts faced with it are able to draw upon 50 or 60 years of established jurisprudence [at Strasbourg]. If you start introducing a new bill of rights and possibly new definitions and new provisions which have slightly changed the rights that are already covered by the convention, there's a risk of incoherence creeping in \u2013 particularly if it's going to stand side by side with the convention, which will still bind the UK nationally.</p> <p>\"Until [we] see what [a new bill] adds or takes away, it's difficult to form an assessment but I don't see the need. It's said it would make it more British and will build in the right to a jury trial \u2026 Do you need to build it in as a separate right? I'm doubtful.\"</p> <p>Bratza also warned that the UK's reluctance to give prisoners voting rights \u2013 in defiance of repeated rulings by the ECHR \u2013 risked damaging the convention system. The final deadline for the UK to comply with the Strasbourg ruling is next month. In the meantime Strasbourg has accumulated several thousand related claims on voting rights from prisoners.</p> <p>\"The fact that there's been non-compliance with prisoners' rights has had an effect,\" Bratza said.</p> <p>\"For a country as important as the UK to be seen not to be implementing the judgment has had an impact. It's not led to any greater determination of other states to be defiant, but I do think that it's seen as damaging that a country as important as the UK has not complied with a court judgment yet.\"</p>",
  "<p>The official line is that the British don't \"do\" torture, but by drawing on previously unseen official documents and accounts of witnesses, victims and experts, Ian Cobain reveals a very different story.

Earlier this year the government appeared to be rushing to get its Security and Justice Bill through Parliament. If it does become law before the proceedings on behalf of Belhaj come to court (and they're civil proceedings, rather than a prosecution) it would mean that evidence given in defence of the government, and former ministers and officials, could be heard in secret.<br>There are plenty of critics of the Bill who believe that this is its central purpose.<br>Whether this reduces accountability remains to be seen.<br>But it's difficult to see how anything could neuter the weight of evidence relating to the joint UK-Libyan rendition operations of 2004: there's just so much of it.<br>And it's worth remembering that there's also a criminal investigation into this matter.

I think that whatever opportunities there may be for liberal democracies to advocate for improved conduct by other states must be fatally undermined when those democracies are shown to have been involved in rendition to torture.<br>How can the UK government raise these matters with other governments, and expect a useful response?<br>There's nothing new here: we now know that when the British government tried to talk to the Soviet authorities about their treatment of dissidents in the 1970s, the Soviets responded by saying, in terms: \"Okay, and perhaps then we can then talk about Castlereagh...\" - the police holding centre in Belfast.<br>I don't think torture will ever be considered acceptable in the UK.

It's worth thinking about why it's used: not just to extract information, but to obtain \"confessions\" that can be used in subsequent court proceedings (as in Northern Ireland in the 70s and for a while in the early 90s); to secure what the British used to call the transfer of loyalties (used by the British when dealing with foreign agents during the Second World War); and to intimidate individuals, communities or even entire societies (used to great effect, unfortunately, in many parts of the world today).<br>But I'm not sure that it ever has just one consequence. I know a man who was tortured by police in Northern Ireland in 1977. He was subsequently jailed for life for murder - one of several killings for which he was responsible - on the basis of an admission he was said to have made under torture. After ten years in jail he left the IRA, believing he could no longer support the campaign of violence, but remained incarcerated for a further six. On release he became a useful and productive member of society.<br>His torture had real utility: it removed this man from society, preventing him being involved in spreading further grief, fear and anger, until he was ready to live a peaceful life.<br>On the other hand, this man tells me that he is concerned that torture creates what he calls \"a reservoir of hatred\", which will not run dry for generations: he fears that there are Irish children not yet born who will grow to hate the British state because of what was done to him.<br>I also know a number of the police officers who were involved in the interrogations at the holding centres. Many had come to the conclusion by the late '70s that what they had been doing had prolonged, rather than shortened, the conflict.<br>Not sure whether that answers your question, but I hope it's useful.<br></p> <h2><strong>chemoi45moscow asks:</strong></h2> <p><br>Given that the Tories could make big capital out of New Labour's apparent complicity in torture during the \"war on terror\".

Then various people in buildings around Whitehall appeared to get their hands on the plan, and what was eventually proposed was a secretive review rather than an inquiry, with no victim participation, and in which ministers and officials would be able to give evidence behind closed doors. Not surprisingly, almost every human rights group in the world announced they were boycotting it.<br>Perhaps one of the lessons to be learned from Bloody Sunday and Hillsborough - and there are plenty of those - is that the British state cannot be trusted to investigate itself, and that no wrong-going will be acknowledged until a generation - rather than a General Election - has passed?</p>",
  "<p>Concern is growing among human rights campaigners and politicians over the widespread and potentially lethal police use of Tasers after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/17/police-taser-blind-man-stick\" title=\"\">an innocent blind man was shot with a stun gun</a> when his white stick was mistaken for a samurai sword.</p> <p>Colin Farmer, 61, was Tasered in the back after police received reports of a man running through Chorley, Lancashire, with a sword. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating but the officer involved has not been suspended and remains on duty.</p> <p>Earlier this month, James McCarthy, a 22-year-old man from Liverpool, suffered a cardiac arrest after he was <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2012/10/01/taser-left-liverpool-man-james-mccarthy-fighting-for-his-life-after-albert-dock-incident-100252-31939058/\" title=\"\">Tasered four times by Merseyside police</a>. He was left critically ill in hospital following a disturbance at Albert Dock after a night out with friends. The force confirmed the matter has been referred to the IPCC.</p> <p>Taser use in England rose by 45% in 2011 and the numbers are expected to continue to increase as more weapons are given to rank-and-file officers. The stun guns were fired by police at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/17/man-dies-taser-arrest-cumbria\" title=\"\">27-year-old Dale Burns in Barrow, Cumbria</a>, last year, who later died. In the US, where they are more regularly used, there have been hundreds of deaths.</p> <p>Sophie Khan, a solicitor advocate at McMillan Williams, who set up the legal action group Police Action Centre to challenge the widespread use of stun guns, cites a case in which a mentally ill man on a roof was hit with a Taser by police and the muscle spasms led to him falling off the roof. She said she was also aware of a case in Birmingham of a disabled man who was Tasered after he was physically incapable of leaving his mobility vehicle as demanded by police.</p> <p>\"Their use is too wide and too loose,\" she said. \"There needs to be more control and restraint; training needs to be looked at, otherwise we are in a situation where police are breaching article 3 of the Human Rights Act and the state is responsible for such breaches.\"</p> <p>Before 2008, the use of Tasers was restricted to firearms officers, but their use has increased in recent years as more frontline officers have access to them.</p> <p>Khan said ordinary people were being Tasered in circumstances where it was not warranted. She describes the Farmer case as \"probably the worst example. It's a bit obvious that he had no weapon and is an elderly man and there's no threat to the public or the police.\"</p> <p>The weapons were deployed during the eviction of Travellers at Dale Farm in Essex a year ago and controversially earlier this year on <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9256183/Police-taser-Alzheimers-sufferer-58-several-times.html\" title=\"\">Peter Russell, a 59-year-old man with Alzheimer's</a>, in Epworth, Lincolnshire.</p> <p>The Police Federation wants to treble the number of officers using Tasers from the 12,000 currently in use to 36,000. Forces in England and Wales fired the weapons on more than 1,500 occasions in the year ending March 2011.</p> <p>Officers are supposed to use the Tasers only as a last resort where they \"would be facing violence or threats of violence of such severity that they would need to use such force to protect the public, themselves and/or the subject\".</p> <p>Deborah Coles, co-director of Inquest, said Tasers posed an \"ever present risk of death or injury\". She added: \"We've always said the more weapons you arm police with, the more likely they are to use them. There's poor scrutiny of Taser use, which is an issue. Of particular concern is when they are used on people who are vulnerable through mental health issues or pre-existing medical conditions.\"</p> <p>Coles wants more robust guidelines and reporting of Taser use and says the Chorley case raises questions over the \"disproportionate use of force\".</p> <p>Amnesty's UK arms programme director, Oliver Sprague, said the Farmer incident illustrates why Amnesty insists Tasers are \"used only in the strictest set of circumstances, which involves a threat to life or very serious injury\".</p> <p>He said: \"It also shows that officers must undergo intensive, rigorous training which takes into account how to respond to people in vulnerable groups, including the visually impaired.\"</p> <p>Essential precautions must be taken before the Taser is fired, he added, with strict Home Office guidelines outlining exactly when and in what circumstances Tasers are used. Without these, Amnesty remains \"concerned\" that police are more likely to use them in circumstances where it is not appropriate.</p> <p>Farmer, who has had two strokes, said he was fearful he would die from another stroke when he was hit in the back. \"I walk at a snail's pace,\" he said. \"They could have walked past me, driven past me in a van or said 'drop your weapon'.\" The Lancashire force has since apologised to him.</p> <p>London Assembly member Jenny Jones, of the Green party, said the London police authority looked at Tasers in depth after all forces were offered them by the then Labour home secretary Jacqui Smith, but rejected them. Jones is concerned that the safeguards required, such as proper training for frontline officers, \"cannot possibly be maintained\" given current budget cuts. She has called on London mayor Boris Johnson to urgently review any plans to roll out Tasers in the capital, as the Metropolitan police commissioner, Bernard Hogan-Howe, has \"made clear his intention to expand their use\".</p>",

The Redskins are probably one of the best sub-.500 teams in the league, although they had a tough day losing Fred Davis possibly for the season.</p> <p>That's all for our coverage of the Redskins and Giants, we'll be back next Sunday with another rolling report from a key NFL match-up, but for now, it's good afternoon from the Brooklyn basement.&#xa0;</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-21T20:28:32.063Z\">at 9.28pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50845583c0e343ef1abc7db2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-21T20:05:23.670Z\">9.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Giants 27 - Redskins 23, 0:22, 4th quarter</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Griffin finds Morgan, who fumbles and recovers.

Don't see that often, FOX says it is his longest carry of the year, four yards, finishing it with a slide RGIII should seek to emulate.</p> <p>First down, and Bradshaw roars up the middle, a desperate run, dragging his pursuers forward and he never goes down! He's stopped only by forward progress for a tough, seven yard gain. He goes again, this time for two yards, and on third down, Manning throws incomplete to Cruz in the endzone. That's a play Manning usually makes, but he threw it behind the receiver.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>FIELD GOAL!</strong></p> <p>So the Giants chew up big chunks of real estate on this drive but only get three points after the bad throw by Eli.

Washington (3-3) beat the&#xa0;Giants&#xa0;twice last year, and that was before Robert Griffin III came into the league. In fact, you could probably say that the last time New York really stunk out the joint was against the Skins, back in December of last year. A week after Eli Manning nearly singlehandedly beat the Cowboys in a game that they had to win, New York came back and played what was probably their worst game of the season against Washington, and lost 23-10. They didn't lose again, streaking to a second Super Bowl title in five seasons.&#xa0;</p> <p>Now, having already dropped a pair of NFC East games, (their only losses) the 4-2 Giants face a revitalized Washington team,&#xa0;pumped&#xa0;up by a rookie duo that are looking to add another dimension to the Skins renaissance. RGIII has completed 70% pf his passes while rushing for nearly 400 yards, averaging nearly seven yards per carry. Alfred Morris is also&#xa0;having&#xa0;a major impact in his first year - he's fifth in rushing this season.</p> <p>Before the Giants stuffed the 49ers rushing attack last week you'd be tempted to say New York would be in some serious trouble against a team that enjoys such success on the ground, but New York's D found their mojo in San Francisco and all bets are off, especially if DT Chris Canty returns to the fold, which is&#xa0;likely.&#xa0;</p> <p>New York's offense has also picked up steam as of late, Ahmad Bradshaw has&#xa0;resuscitated their rushing game with over 300 yards in two weeks, while Eli has been Eli, which is always trouble, except of course, vs. these Redskins - Manning couldn't manage a TD pass against them last season if you can believe that. Expect that to change today with the Skins decrepit pass defense.&#xa0;</p> <p>So, RGIII comes to New York, or New Jersey, or wherever you want to call it, and kickoff isn't far off now. So get your trans fats out and get ready for some (American) football.

  "<p>On 4 June 2009 Barack Obama bounded on to the stage at Cairo University to deliver a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/04/barack-obama-keynote-speech-egypt?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">speech </a>which promised to seek&#xa0;\"a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world\". It was, he said solemnly, a time of great&#xa0;tension.</p> <p>Speaking from a lectern set against a backdrop of plush red curtains, Obama sought to move beyond the toxic legacy of the 9/11 attacks, the US-led invasion of Iraq, the \"war on terror\" and the long and occasionally bloody impasse on the Palestinian issue.</p> <p>Expectations were enormous. Even at the time it was hard to imagine that this young African-American president with Muslim roots could meet them all. Still, Obama had opposed George Bush on Iraq and chided him for not doing enough to promote a just peace for the Palestinians \u2013 the two defining Middle Eastern issues of the preceding, turbulent years.</p> <p>The 55-minute speech was widely praised for its eloquence and ambition, but the reviews were mixed. For <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jun/04/barack-obama-middleeast\" title=\"\">one commentator</a>, the key was to get beyond the courtesies \u2013 <em>mujamalat</em> in Arabic \u2013 to the beef. Honeyed words were welcome, went a typical response. But would actions follow? Was Obama really any more than \"a Bush in sheep's clothing\"?</p> <p>Now, as the end of his term nears, the answer is clear: Obama was different from his predecessor. Yet his record is as varied as the responses to the Cairo address. An extraordinary chain of unforeseen events \u2013 a hazard for any leader \u2013 has created new circumstances and new dilemmas.</p> <p>On Palestine, always a touchstone for Arabs and Muslims, Obama has been a grave disappointment. Having strikingly called the situation of the Palestinians \"intolerable\", he blinked first in the confrontation with Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, over whether settlements in the occupied territories would have to stop before peace talks could resume. US domestic politics interceded. Hopes of a two-state solution to the world's most intractable conflict are now fading fast.</p> <p>From the start, Obama reached out to Iran with a friendly message to its people and hints at flexibility in negotiations with its government. But his efforts to engage have failed, leading only to tougher sanctions and a covert war. Unless long-running diplomacy starts to work, a potentially catastrophic confrontation over its nuclear programme still looms.</p> <p>US troops have now left Iraq, but the country is racked by sectarianism and is not a reliable friend, its post-Saddam leaders in thrall to Tehran. On another post-9/11 front, US forces are beginning to wind down the war in Afghanistan. Obama has, though, escalated drone strikes against al-Qaida from Pakistan to Yemen. The killing of Osama bin Laden in his Abbotabad hideout was a national security triumph. Yet the dangers of jihadi violence, spreading to areas such as Somalia and the Maghreb, live on. The Guant\u00e1namo Bay detention centre, which Obama pledged to close, remains open \u2013 a stain on his record.</p> <p>In Cairo, Obama touched on the broad issue of political change in a sclerotic Arab world whose rulers sold themselves as guarantors of stability and western interests. That required an especially delicate balance. Watching as he spoke was Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, a US ally for whom democracy was a dirty word. And Obama had spent the previous night at the desert ranch of the octogenarian King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, the indispensable guardian of cheap western oil supplies.</p> <p>America, the president said, with a humble nod to these ageing Arab autocrats \u2013 and in a lightly coded reference to Bush's controversial \"freedom agenda\" \u2013 did \"not presume to know what is best for everyone\". But there was a bigger nod: \"I do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things: the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed; confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice; government that is transparent and doesn't steal from the people; the freedom to live as you choose.\"</p> <p>Eighteen months later, the uprisings of the Arab spring tested that awkward construct. From the short and mostly peaceful revolution in Tunisia to carnage in Syria, Obama's responses have, as one admirer put it, mixed \"pragmatism and values\".</p> <p>Egypt's revolution provided the first hurdle. Obama was criticised for backing stability as the drama of Tahrir Square unfolded. But on 1 February came his call for Mubarak to step down \"now\". <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/25/us/politics/arab-spring-proves-a-harsh-test-for-obamas-diplomatic-skill.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">As the New York Times wrote</a>: \"Obama upended three decades of American relations with its most stalwart ally in the Arab world, putting the weight of the United States squarely on the side of&#xa0;the Arab street.\"</p> <p>So when Mohamed Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood leader who succeeded Mubarak to become Egypt's first democratically elected president, visited Washington last month \u2013 after demonstrations in Cairo and far beyond over a crude Islamophobic film \u2014 the tension was as obvious as the change was palpable. The US hope is that engagement, combined with the responsibility of exercising power, will encourage Islamist-led governments toward pragmatism.</p> <p>Libya's revolution illustrated Obama's ambivalent attitude to force and his reluctance to get involved in another war in a Muslim country. Washington \"led from behind,\" providing air power and intelligence but leaving it to Nato's European powers and their Arab allies to help overthrow Muammar Gaddafi. The brutal aftermath \u2013 in which jihadis killed the US ambassador in Benghazi \u2013 painfully underlined the dangers.</p> <p>Syria, the bloodiest front of the Arab spring, has been the biggest challenge. Obama demanded Bashar al-Assad's departure but resisted pressures to arm the opposition or impose a no-fly zone. Now anxiety is growing about the rise of jihadi-type groups and the \"blowback\" on the Gulf and the wider region.</p> <p>Obama has defended his record of supporting democratisation despite chaos and crises. \"It was absolutely the right thing for us to do to align ourselves with democracy, universal rights, a notion that people have to be able to participate in their own governance,\" <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/09/24/transcript-obama-on-60-minutes/\" title=\"\">he said on 60 Minutes</a> in September.</p> <p>Critics say that in trying to balance US national security with the promotion of democratic values and human rights, Obama has ducked hard choices. Shadi Hamid of the Brookings Institution characterises this stance as \"aggressive hedging,\" which has alienated both regimes and their opponents. \"Autocrats, particularly in the Gulf, think Obama naively supports Arab revolutionaries, while Arab protesters and revolutionaries seem to think the opposite,\" Hamid <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-01/hunt-for-obama-s-middle-east-policy-comes-up-empty.html\" title=\"\">said</a>.</p> <p>In Bahrain, on the sectarian divide between the Sunni and Shia worlds, home to the US fifth fleet and a key link in western defences against Iran, strategy and a Saudi veto trumped universal rights.</p> <p>Israel's close links with the US and worries about Iran have acted as a brake: a new tolerance of Islamists does not extend to the armed \"resistance\" movements \u2013 Lebanon's Hezbollah or Hamas in Palestine.</p> <p>\"Obama has successfully moved the US out of the ditch that George W Bush left the country in,\" Fawaz Gerges argued in a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Obama-Middle-East-Americas-Moment/dp/0230113818\" title=\"\">recent book</a>. \"But the test \u2026 will be whether or not he can realign US foreign policy with progressive and democratic voices in the region and translate his words into concrete policies.\"</p> <p>So to look back now to the uplifting rhetoric of June 2009 is to reflect on the gap between ambition and reality. Considering the choice between Obama and Romney, Arab political blog Awsaat offered only the weakest of support for the president who aroused such hopes when he spoke of that \"new beginning\" between America and Muslims. \"Although many of us are feeling disappointed with Obama's first term,\" it said, \"unfortunately we can choose between the bad we know or the worse we don't know.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Roman emperor Augustus is supposed to have come up with the phrase <em>festina lente</em>, which in English means make haste slowly. It is an apt summing up for what has been happening to the global economy these past four years: policymakers have certainly been hyperactive but progress has been painfully slow. Organisations from the Bank of England to the International Monetary Fund, and from the Office for Budget Responsibility to the Federal Reserve, accept they have been far too optimistic in their forecasts.</p> <p>It has been less make haste slowly, more getting nowhere fast.</p> <p>The weakening in activity this year has set off warning bells. The IMF says the risk of a serious global slowdown is \"alarmingly high\" and believes it may have been underestimating the multipliers used to calculate the impact of fiscal policy.</p> <p>Changes to tax and spending affect the economy. If a pound of extra spending delivers a pound of extra growth, that means the multiplier is 1; if it delivers 50p of extra growth then the multiplier is 0.5. The same ratios apply in reverse when governments are imposing austerity programmes.</p> <p>The IMF has been using a multiplier of 0.5, but its latest estimate is between 0.9 and 1.7. The implication is that raising taxes and cutting spending causes a much bigger loss of output than previously thought, helping to explain why growth has been so weak.</p> <p>There are a few reasons to be cautious about the IMF's rethink. First, it might be an attempt to rewrite the past after inaccurate forecasts. Second, calculating the multiplier is a notoriously difficult business and there are many reputable economists who have made much lower estimates. Third, there are those, including George Osborne, who think the higher estimates fail fully to take into account the unprecedented loosening of monetary policy - cuts in interest rates and dollops of electronic money creation - that was designed to offset the fiscal tightening.</p> <p>Even so, the IMF study deserves to be taken seriously. Why? Because the multiplier effect could well be stronger when many countries are imposing austerity programmes simultaneously, and if interest rates are already extremely low there may be a limit to what a further easing of monetary policy can do to stimulate activity.</p> <p>Central banks have sought to help through bond-buying, which drives down long-term interest rates and sends cash to the banking system. But some say that these asset purchases, or quantitative easing (QE), are subject to the law of diminishing returns.</p> <p>Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that the IMF is right and the multipliers are bigger than was thought. What thenis to be done? The obvious answer would be to relax fiscal policy, because if the multiplier is in the middle of the IMF's range, \u00a31 of tax cuts or increased public spending would deliver \u00a31.30 of growth.</p> <p>Today's policymakers should, in other words, take a leaf out of Franklin Roosevelt's book and embark on a New Deal style programme of public works.</p> <p>This certainly has its attractions for Britain, where the infrastructure is so poor and the cost of borrowing so cheap.</p> <p>But the economic historian Nick Crafts warned this week against drawing parallels with the 1930s, mainly because US public finances were much healthier than the UK's are now. America's annual budget deficit \u2013 the gap between taxes and spending \u2013 averaged less than 3% of gross domestic product in the 1930s, compared with a figure that could be as high as 8% in Britain this year. The ratio of US national debt to GDP was below 40% at the end of the 1930s, while Britain's is on course to peak at well over double that level.</p> <p>That's not to say that a different approach to fiscal policy would be impossible \u2013 but there is a balance of risks. Tightening or tightening too fast could send the economy on a downward spiral of cuts and weak growth and further cuts.. That's particularly the case when the private and public sectors try to cut their high debt levels simultaneously, as in the UK today. The chancellor is concerned that market interest rates would rise if he appeared to be abandoning deficit reduction. Other risks would be a run on the pound and the possibility that individuals and companies would save more in anticipation of today's fiscal easing resulting in higher taxes or higher inflation tomorrow.</p> <p>These concerns are reflected in the government's stance. Instead of announcing a mass public housing programme to make up the country's shortfall of 3 million homes, Osborne is proposing changes to the planning laws in an attempt to prompt the private sector to take advantage of current low interest rates. Similarly, he prefers to use the state's balance sheet to guarantee private sector infrastructure projects rather than spend the money himself.</p> <p>That approach will take time to work \u2013 if it works at all. As a result, we have to assume that monetary policy will continue to take most of the strain here, as it will in the US and the eurozone.</p> <p>At the very least, the bank rate will stay at 0.5% for the foreseeable future and there will be no reining in of QE. If the expectation of an announcement this week that the economy grew in the third quarter proves another false dawn, the chancellor will be forced to look again at a fiscal stance that iin the next two years is set to take more demand out of the economy than in 2012-13.</p> <p>And what if the economy remains permanently depressed and deflation starts to look a more likely threat than inflation? In those circumstances, as Lord Turner - the chairman of the Financial Services Authority and a candidate to be the next governor of the Bank of England - says, policy might need to get even more unconventional.</p> <p>This is code for so-called \"helicopter drops\" of money, in which the Treasury would effectively write cheques to the public. If every adult received \u00a3500, that would add \u00a320bn of spending power to the economy, and the Bank of England could ensure that the handouts did not add to public borrowing by printing \u00a320bn in new money.</p> <p>But if there is a risk that the markets would freak out at Osborne investing more in long-term infrastructure projects that would help improve the efficiency and productivity of the economy, isn't there also a risk that they would see this as Britain heading down the road to the Weimar Republic? Of course there is. That's why it would be a last resort.</p>",
  "<p>The man with <a href=\"http://www.soccermajesty.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/andrea-pilro-chuck-norris-troll.jpg\" title=\"\">the Chuck Norris beard</a> continues to resemble a sporting version thereof. Andrea Pirlo does not play football, he subjugates it. When an Andrea Pirlo pass appears to miss its target, that's only because his plan was too sophisticated for human brains to process. The last person to see Andrea Pirlo lose a match is a liar.</p> <p>If the myth of Pirlo can get out of hand, then sometimes the reality is even more remarkable. Coming into this weekend's match against Napoli, the midfielder had genuinely not experienced defeat in a Serie A fixture for 22 months. During that spell he had joined Juventus, won the Scudetto and carried his country to the final of Euro 2012. <a href=\"http://www.football-italia.net/26318/del-bosque-ballon-dor-pirlo\" title=\"\">He has even been discussed as an outside candidate for the Ballon d'Or</a>.</p> <p>But as incredible a revival as it has been for Pirlo \u2013 who was so out of favour at Milan by the time of that December 2010 defeat to Roma that he would get just six more games for them before being pushed out in the summer \u2013 there have also been setbacks. Italy did, after all, finish on the losing side of the Euro 2012 final. And one club side have succeeded in beating Pirlo's Juve; the same team they were facing this weekend.</p> <p>If Napoli's 2-0 win in last season's Coppa Italia final represented the lone black mark on Pirlo's Juventus resume then that was not the only reason for this to be considered a significant fixture. The Partenopei also arrived at this weekend as the only other unbeaten team left in Serie A this season, sat level with Juve in first place \u2013 with 19 points from seven games.</p> <p>The tension was heightened by bad blood between the two clubs. Following an extra-time defeat to Juventus in the pre-season SuperCup, Napoli's players had refused to take part in the medal ceremony \u2013 an act of protest against perceived refereeing injustices. They were duly rewarded with a bonus by their team's owner, Aurelio De Laurentiis, who threatened to boycott future editions of the fixture.</p> <p>Conspiracy was to the fore as this Saturday's game approached. The Italian Football Federation was forced to defend itself from accusations of favouritism after it emerged that the Juventus manager Antonio Conte had handed over <a href=\"http://yhoo.it/QmZ953\" title=\"\">details of his players' personalised training regimens to the national team</a>. In truth this was simply the sort of co-operation that the Italy manager Cesare Prandelli has been seeking to foster with all club sides.</p> <p>When Gigi Buffon was ruled out of Tuesday's game against Denmark, claims were made that this was nothing but a ruse to keep him fresh for the weekend \u2013 a theory which was rather disproved when the goalkeeper failed to recover in time to play on Saturday. The Turin-based newspaper, Tuttosport, meanwhile, ran <a href=\"http://bocca.blogautore.repubblica.it/2012/10/18/sfida-scudetto-juve-napoli-3-una-domanda-al-giorno-una-societa-emergente-puo-competere-con-una-grande/\" title=\"\">a front-page headline on Thursday warning the powers that be not to pick the \"wrong\" referee</a>.</p> <p>As if that were not a colourful enough backdrop for this game, rather more dramatic events \u2013 ones that had nothing to do with football \u2013 were to unfold on Thursday afternoon. The Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci was emerging from a Ferrari dealership with his wife and three-month old son when he was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/20/leonardo-bonucci-punches-armed-robber\" title=\"\">accosted by a mugger</a> \u2013 who reportedly pointed a gun at the player's face while demanding that he hand over his watch.</p> <p>According to published accounts, Bonucci's wife, carrying their son, dived immediately into their car, but the player himself froze. Then, as the mugger reached out his spare hand to grab the timepiece, Bonucci punched him \u2013 first in the arm and then the face, causing him to fall to the ground. The defender then proceeded to chase his would-be aggressor down the street. The mugger jumped on the bike of a waiting accomplice, though even here Bonucci briefly attempted to block their escape.</p> <p>If this was an act of rare bravery \u2013 and perhaps also stupidity, given the risk involved \u2013 then the defender would go on to show a more conventional kind of toughness in the game itself. Bonucci's afternoon seemed to be at an end as early as the 17th minute, when he had to be carried out on a stretcher after appearing to injure his knee. And yet, moments later there he was, sprinting back on with his knee heavily bound.</p> <p>\"[It was] a bandage that belonged to the old days of football,\" Alessandro Vocalelli wrote in La Repubblica. \"The sort that made us fall in love with the sport because certain players, with their heads wrapped in a turban or with three metres of bandages around their thigh, looked like real sporting heroes.\"</p> <p>Bonucci would go on to turn in a solid performance, though in the event heroism was not required. Napoli, despite dominating possession, showed little ambition going forwards, their one chance of the first-half arriving from a free-kick which Edinson Cavani whipped against the intersection of post and crossbar in the 27th minute.</p> <p>Cavani, whose own preparations for the game were disrupted when he missed a connection on his convoluted return journey from Bolivia (where he had been on international duty with Uruguay), otherwise found himself isolated on a team whose top priority seemed to be restricting their hosts. With 10 minutes left to play that looked destined to prove a successful endeavour, with the game still goalless and Juve creating little by way of clear-cut chances.</p> <p>But that was before Pirlo intervened. His had been a relatively quiet game, boxed in by the combination of Marek Hamsik and a packed three-man central midfield, but there was nothing Napoli could do to restrict his delivery at set-pieces. From a corner on the left he picked out the substitute Martin Caceres, who headed home with aplomb. Moments later <a href=\"http://www.101greatgoals.com/gvideos/paul-pogba-juventus-v-napoli/\" title=\"\">Paul Pogba would add a second with a fine volley</a> from outside the box. Napoli had no answer.</p> <p>Angelo Alessio, filling in for the suspended Conte on the bench for the first time after completing his own ban, could hardly claim credit for the decision to bring on C\u00e1ceres, prompted as it was by an injury to Kwadwo Asamoah. But the introduction of Pogba in place of Arturo Vidal was, with hindsight, inspired. The former Manchester United midfielder had also helped create the space for C\u00e1ceres's opener \u2013 his height and presence causing two defenders to go with him at the corner.</p> <p>\"I am not expecting any text message off [Sir Alex] Ferguson,\" said Pogba. \"For me the Red Devils are in the past, I don't think about that any more. I am just looking forward to my future with Juventus. There were other teams who wanted me \u2013 Milan and some English clubs. I chose Juve because French players have always done very well here: I'm thinking about Zidane, Platini and Deschamps.\"</p> <p>He has a little way to go yet to match those players, yet it is clear already that Pogba was another astute addition for Juventus \u2013 capable of contributing in different roles across the midfield. And this was certainly another victory for the collective \u2013 C\u00e1ceres and Pogba becoming the club's 12th and 13th goalscorers of the season respectively. A team for whom the lack of one stand-out forward was supposed to be a weakness have instead turned it into a strength.</p> <p>But it helps, too, to have a player like Pirlo, capable always of summoning the killer ball that undoes a dogged opponent. Juventus are unbeaten in 47 games, but even they have tasted defeat more recently than he has.</p> <h2>Talking Points</h2> <p>\u2022 More of these to follow on Monday, but for now just a quick mention of Saturday's other game \u2013 in which Lazio beat Milan 3-2. It was almost a remarkable comeback for the Rossoneri, who were 3-0 down early in the second-half, before goals from Nigel De Jong and Stephan El Shaarawy sparked a frantic finish. The defeat once again ramps up the speculation surrounding Massimiliano Allegri's position as manager of the Rossoneri, though credit should be given, too, to Lazio's Vladimir Petkovic. The <a href=\"http://blogs.thescore.com/footyblog/2012/09/18/bandini-who-is-vladimir-petkovic-how-a-full-time-charity-worker-became-coach-at-lazio/\" title=\"\">charity worker-turned manager</a> has done an incredible job to turn around a club where the mood in pre-season was verging on mutinous. The Biancocelesti now sit just one point behind second-placed Napoli. Milan, by contrast, are 15 points off first and would be within two points of last-place were it not for the points deduction handed to Siena as a result of this summer's match-fixing investigations.</p> <p>\u2022 A goal worth seeing from that game: <a href=\"http://www.101greatgoals.com/gvideos/golazo-antonio-candreva-lazio-v-ac-milan/\" title=\"\">Antonio Candreva with Lazio's second</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 Compounding Milan's misery that little bit further will be the knowledge that Antonio Cassano, whom they sent to Inter part-exchange for Giampaolo Pazzini over the summer, has since become the single most productive player for their city rivals. Cassano it was who opened the scoring for the Nerazzurri this weekend against Catania, heading home his fifth goal of the season. He is, indeed, the leading goalscorer on a team who also moved to within a point of Napoli.</p> <p>\u2022 The most entertaining fixture of the weekend once again involved Roma, who seem to have learned at last from their early-season follies under Zdenek Zeman. This time, instead of blowing a lead they reversed the formula \u2013 allowing Genoa a two-goal head-start that had been wiped out by half-time and become a 4-2 victory for the Giallorossi by the finish. Beyond the three points this felt like a victory for Zeman himself too, with Daniele De Rossi excellent and Pablo Osvaldo scoring two goals following their unexpected <a href=\"http://blogs.thescore.com/footyblog/2012/10/09/bandini-de-rossis-days-at-roma-under-zeman-may-be-numbered/\">exclusions from the win over Atalanta before the international break</a>. \"I don't want to talk about that any more,\" said Osvaldo. \"I've heard all sorts in the last few days, but I don't worry about these things.\"</p> <p><strong>Results: </strong>Juventus 2-0 Napoli, Lazio 3-2 AC Milan, Cagliari 1-0 Bologna, Atalanta 2-1 Siena, Chievo 1-1 Fiorentina, Inter 2-0 Catania, Palermo 0-0 Torino, Parma 2-1 Sampdoria, Udinese 1-0 Pescara, Genoa 2-4 Roma.<strong> </strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://guardian.touch-line.com/?Lang=0&amp;CTID=13\" title=\"\">The latest Serie A table</a></p>",

  "<p>This weekend, David Cameron is a man at bay, beset by critics who claim that the dramatic resignation of his<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/19/andrew-mitchell-resigns-police-pleb\" title=\"\"> chief whip</a> strengthens the impression of a gulf between the privileged background and elitist sentiments of the prime minister's entourage and the vast majority of ordinary Britons. The farcical scenes that surrounded <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/19/george-osborne-inspector-train-ticket\" title=\"\">his chancellor's train journey</a> to London in a first-class compartment seemed to add a dash of colour to this picture.</p> <p>But it was the events of last Wednesday, when Mr Cameron appeared to be making energy policy up on the hoof \u2013 telling the House of Commons that he would make power suppliers offer the cheapest rates to all consumers \u2013 that might prove to be most damaging to his claim to that most vital prime ministerial asset: competence.</p> <p>It would be tempting to think this gaffe was just a manifestation of the growing political pressure on him to tackle the major power companies on profiteering while redeveloping policy for a lower carbon future \u2013 in double-quick time. But the urgency is really the culmination, not of months or even years, but decades of inaction in a country that has taken energy supply for granted due to the geological fortune of North Sea oil and gas.</p> <p>Margaret Thatcher was talking about the threat of climate change in 1988 although she did nothing much about it while rushing for hydrocarbons largely as a tool to shut down mines and neutralise powerful trade unions. Meanwhile, the seabed fortune was squandered by a succession of governments. Where is the trillion-pound sovereign wealth fund that could be invested in green technologies or even just provide cash for future generations?</p> <p>Worse than this, no one prepared for the inevitable rundown in North Sea oil and gas, leaving the UK increasingly dependent on high-cost imports. This decline in local supplies has come at a time when the coalition increasingly sees gas as the energy source of the future because it can heat homes and be burned in power stations.</p> <p>Coal, nuclear and gas have traditionally been the fuels of choice for the wholesale power companies but tough new environmental regulations and old age are leading to a fast phase-out of the first two. Meanwhile, efforts to usher in a new era of lower-carbon electricity generation from renewables such as wind and solar plus new nuclear plants have been characterised by ministerial dithering, mixing prejudice with practical concerns.</p> <p>The development of onshore wind has been set back by planning objections while offshore farms have been dogged by rows over the high level of subsidies. Progress has been made with new projects and an enormous amount of work is going on to reduce costs of wind-generated power but even so the renewable sector was always going to produce \u2013 at most \u2013 just 30% of all electricity by 2020. Nuclear, which once provided nearly a quarter of our electricity and now is down to little more than 10%, remains stuck in a financial rut of its own.</p> <p>Many of the foreign power companies that originally championed new UK atomic plants, such as RWE and E.ON of Germany, have decided to leave the market, while EDF, the main cheerleader, has found its enthusiasm dented by a new and less sympathetic government on its home patch, France. EDF is now badgering for the highest possible financial incentives before agreeing to go ahead with its first planned station at Hinkley Point.</p> <p>It may yet get what it wants, but the chances of the once-vaunted nuclear renaissance in Britain seems pretty much dead for an international industry undermined by the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster and huge cost overruns at other new nuclear projects.</p> <p>We will learn on Tuesday about the prospects for UK atomic new-build when the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/ecc\" title=\"\">Energy and Climate Change Committee</a> meets. Similarly, we will hear on 5 November the government's wider vision of how it will keep the lights burning through the final version of the energy bill and, in particular, its details on electrical market reform. This document is meant to show how Britain can provide itself with power, encourage even more lower-carbon generation and keep energy bills down at a time when fuel poverty is growing.</p> <p>How this will be achieved is a mystery as we have seen contradictory messages from a Conservative-dominated and renewable-sceptical Treasury versus a Lib Dem-influenced and low-carbon-facing Department of Energy and Climate Change. For good measure, the commercial community is also divided. A minority of manufacturing leaders believe Britain must embrace a new low-carbon future while a short-termist majority fear only that low-carbon initiatives could drive up costs.</p> <p>And while this struggle to come up with a meaningful and final energy bill goes on, power companies have continued to infuriate consumers and politicians with a succession of domestic price increases. The energy suppliers say they are covering rises in international gas costs and need cash to invest in lower-carbon options. However, like the bank industry before them, their credibility is shot. This is the sector that has been fined for mis-selling products, introduced hugely complicated tariff structures and has shown an ability to raise retail prices quickly in poor times for the market while demonstrating a remarkable laxity in lowering them when markets improve. Their spokesperson as chief executive of Energy UK is Angela Knight, until recently the chief executive of the British Bankers' Association.</p> <p>Not that long experience in the energy sector counts for much. Alistair Buchanan, the boss of regulator Ofgem, has been given the runaround by the power companies and has failed to curb their excesses until too late. On Friday, he unveiled plans to force suppliers to tell householders about their cheapest deals but this was a good deal softer than Cameron's initiative at parliamentary questions, which we are assured has been \"misunderstood\".</p> <p>The real misunderstandings have come from governments (not just this one) failing to grasp the need for an energy policy that looks ahead 30 years and does not leave it all to a market driven by short-term considerations. We need energy ministers who stay in post for more than a dozen months. We need to build low-carbon technology champions. We need an Olympian vision, not a Cameron cock-up.</p>"
