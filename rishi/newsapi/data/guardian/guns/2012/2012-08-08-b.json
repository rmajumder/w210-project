  "<p>Decried daily by secularists at home and labouring under heavy clouds of suspicion abroad, Egypt's first Islamist president, Mohammed Morsi, showed he had teeth. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/08/egypt-sinai-offensive-islamic-militants\" title=\"\">He sent in helicopter gunships to attack Islamic militants in the Sinai</a>, the first time the Egyptian air force had been used in the peninsula since the 1973 war with Israel. And he followed this up by sacking the head of the Egyptian general intelligence service, the head of the republican guard, the governor of North Sinai and the head of security in Cairo. For a president struggling to establish civilian rule two months after he was elected, these are bold moves.</p> <p>Morsi was responding to the biggest challenge to his presidency yet, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/08/egypt-launches-missile-assault-sinai\" title=\"\">mass cross-border attack </a>on Israel staged by up to 30 jihadi militants on Sunday night, in which an Egyptian border post was overrun and 16 of its soldiers killed. Try as the Muslim Brotherhood might to avoid an open confrontation with militants who hail from the same ideological roots but who broke away from them decades ago, Morsi rightly decided that the time had now come for him to act. For him, not least every Egyptian, the attack on Sunday was not only aimed at Israel but on the state of Egypt itself. It challenged Egyptian sovereignty in one of its most sensitive areas, the desert Sinai peninsula, which after the 1979 peace treaty with Israel has been largely demilitarised.</p> <p>The peninsula has since nurtured the essential ingredients of a classic <a href=\"http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/0/49807/Egypt/0/Sinai-on-the-brink-Arms-trafficking-and-the-rise-o.aspx\" title=\"\">security vacuum</a>: a population marginalised and on the periphery of a weak state; an influx of arms from Libya; Bedouin tribesmen who run the guns; jihadi militants; gas pipelines; and a long and as yet unsecured border with Israel. To add the final ingredient of this rich brew of actors and their targets, there is the old sore of Egypt's border crossing into Gaza at Rafah. The attack took place just 10 days after a meeting between Morsi and the Hamas prime minister of Gaza, Ismail Haniya. Two branches of the same movement had little difficulty agreeing on measures to regularise cross-border traffic and to close the tunnels. As result fuel oil, badly needed by electricity generators, had started to flow into the besieged Palestinian enclave for the first time in years. Within hours of the attack, which was condemned loudly by Hamas, the Rafah border was closed again, and everything returned to the status quo.</p> <p>The volatility of the Sinai is such that the potential for a further conflict is great. There could, however, be three positive outcomes to the current crisis.</p> <p>A security clampdown on the Egyptian side of the border could be used to normalise the border crossing at Rafah, and close the tunnels. It is not known how many Palestinian militants participated in the cross-border raids, but with a Hamas leadership on one side of the border and a Muslim Brotherhood leader on the other, it should not be too difficult to close the tunnels. In the event of monitored and regulated traffic on the surface, the tunnels would become a liability for both sides.</p> <p>This would be strenuously opposed by Israel, which sees little distinction between the arms flowing into Sinai, and the arms flowing into Hamas' hands in Gaza. But Israel might have second thoughts about automatically rejecting Egypt's second demand, a renegotiation of the Camp David accord to restore Egyptian military control of the peninsula. In response to each emergency, Israel has informally allowed derogations of the treaty on Egyptian troop limits and capabilities. Israeli and Egyptian generals contact each other. All this could be formalised.</p> <p>The third outcome is that the old guard in the Egyptian military has come to be seen for what they are: not powerbrokers of the deep state but a busted flush. Corrupt and unable to guarantee sovereignty in a part of the land where they had total control, the high command needs to be replaced by junior officers whose loyalty is to the state, not to their pockets. The supreme council of armed forces has not come out well from Sunday's attacks.</p>",
  "<p>We all make silly statements. We all make poor predictions. Indeed most Washington pundits are <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/03/study-pundits-wrong-most-_n_856886.html\">right as often as they are wrong</a>. One Washington prognosticator, however, stands above the rest.</p> <p>Step up, Dick Morris.</p> <p>Morris was at one time a top political operative. From his guiding of now Congressman Jerry Nadler's student government campaign to his work for Bill Clinton, Morris was a winner. He was running another Bill Clinton campaign, in 1996, when he found himself <a href=\"http://img.timeinc.net/time/magazine/archive/covers/1996/1101960909_400.jpg\">embroiled in a sex scandal</a>. </p> <p>That imbroglio marked a turning point. Morris was no longer to work for Clinton. Instead, he reinvented himself as a writer and television pundit. It is this work that we celebrate here today.</p> <p>Morris' ability to make statements and predictions that are <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/research/2010/11/09/dick-morris-needs-a-new-crystal-ball/173089\">often so, so wrong</a> is exceptional. He has <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-nickolas/worst-pundit-in-america-d_b_160212.html\">been called</a> the \"worst pundit in America\". The more cynical among us might argue that the word \"America\" should be replaced with \"world\". Indeed, to recall all of Morris's spectacular failures would require more space than Santa is allotted for his Christmas list. </p> <p>Instead, I bring you ten fun and exciting Dick Morris audios, images, videos (in chronological order). Most of these are forecasts, hilarious for just how wrong they were. I cannot guarantee them as the top ten of all time: there are just too many Dick Morris moments from which to choose, so please feel free to note any choices that I've omitted in the discussion thread. </p> <p><strong>1. Bush and congressional Democrats in 2002</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394453697\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344462942974/dickmorriscspan1_460x276.jpg\" alt=\"Dick Morris on C-Span\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dick Morris on C-Span (<a href=\"http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/Plays/start/4646/stop/4826\">view video here</a>)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sometimes, Morris is kind enough to offer us a two-for-one deal. In the span of two minutes, Morris said that President Bush's approval rating would remain in the 80s so long as we were fighting overseas. It did, of course, <a href=\"http://www.hist.umn.edu/~ruggles/Approval.htm\">drop precipitously</a>, into the low 50s, by the 2004 election. Morris also believed that congressional Democrats had neutralized Bush by supporting his wars. It turned out the opposite happened: 2002 was only the second time since 1934 that the president's party gained seats in the House during a midterm election. </p> <p><strong>2. North Korea and Iran will cave</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394453698\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344463003976/dickmorriscspan2_460x276.jpg\" alt=\"Dick Morris on C-Span\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dick Morris on C-Span (<a href=\"http://www.c-spanvideo.org/clip/3662917\">view video here</a>)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I guess Morris thought that if he couldn't predict elections, then he might do better with the actions of foreign governments. Apparently, Bush's foreign policy was going to bring Iran and North Korea to their knees and force them to cooperate with the United States. Eight years later, Iran continues to back the Syrian government and is as close to war with Israel as it's ever been. Oh, and North Korea is as much a mystery and a headache as ever.</p> <p><strong>3. Condi v Hillary</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394453699\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344463109631/dickmorrisbookcover_220.jpg\" alt=\"Dick Morris book cover\" width=\"220\" height=\"329\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dick Morris's 2005 book, Condi Vs.

The 2008 electoral map</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394453700\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344463322458/dickmorrismap_460.jpg\" alt=\"Dick Morris election map\" width=\"460\" height=\"293\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>What do Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, and West Virginia have in common? They are all states where the <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/polls/2008president/\">Pollster.com aggregate</a> favored John McCain over Barack Obama by at least 10 points, yet Morris, for some ridiculous reason, thought the states were toss-ups or leaned Obama? Obama lost them all by 12 to 20 points. And for good measure, Obama won the leaning-McCain state of Indiana.</p> <p><strong>5. Sarah Palin wins 2008 vice-presidential debate</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Mv9pt6LBqwg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Mv9pt6LBqwg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Well, Morris thinks Sarah Palin is Ronald Reagan, or something. Morris also manages to smack around Hillary Clinton in this video. To his point that Palin won the debate? All <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/presidentialdebates/3129259/Who-won-the-VP-debate-Palin-or-Joe-Biden.html\">national polls</a> found voters believing Biden won the debate, by at least 15 points. Some <a href=\"http://www.surveyusa.com/index.php/2008/10/03/ohio-poll-palin-biden-debate-is-split-decision/\">state</a> <a href=\"http://www.surveyusa.com/index.php/2008/10/03/state-of-washington-poll-split-decision-on-palin-biden-vice-presidential-debate/\">data</a> pointed to a closer race, but even there, voters thought Biden was more prepared to be president. Palin resigned from office less than a year later and seemingly has no future in running for political office.</p> <p><strong>6. Democrats to lose over 80 seats in the 2010 midterm elections</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jgImACKB-hY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jgImACKB-hY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>There's a difference between being overly optimistic and being downright off the ledge. Morris crosses that line many times, and did so in calling for Republicans to win 80 new seats in the House of Representatives. Republicans would win a historic victory in 2010, but would only take 63 seats.</p> <p><strong>7. Republicans will shutdown the government over something in 2011 ... and win!</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C_-t7lGR8tI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C_-t7lGR8tI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Sometimes, I'm not even sure from where a Dick Morris prediction comes. Here, he claimed that Republicans would shut down the government after regaining control of the House in the 2010 elections, and would win that shutdown. No shutdown ever happened. I guess one almost did over the debt ceiling, but Republicans were the ones who caved to President Obama. </p> <p><strong>8. Donald Trump to run for president</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://mediamatters.org/embed/181690\"> <iframe class=\"video-embed\" src=\"https://mediamatters.org/embed/181690\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump running for office is like a game of three-card monty. Anyone who knows anything knows that Trump likes to fool around, but at the end of the day, is never going to run. He just likes to hear himself talk. Somehow, Morris thought that Trump had great potential. Trump would plummet in the polls \u2026 and, of course, didn't run.</p> <p><strong>9. Obama to secretly take our guns away on 27 July</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XZeJpXLsVCI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XZeJpXLsVCI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Did you know that President Obama was working in cahoots with the United Nations to take Americans' guns away on 27 July 2012? I didn't either. It was Obama's secret plan to foil the second amendment! Of course, the United States delegation to the UN <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/27/un-arms-trade-treaty-nra_n_1711578.html\">ensured the bill failed</a>.</p> <p><strong>10. The \"real polls\"</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jabmky1BT38?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jabmky1BT38\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>I'm just not even sure I have the words for this one, but Morris claims he has the \"real polls\" from a pollster he can't name. Perhaps the funniest thing of this whole clips is even the \"real polls\" have Romney winning only 228 electoral votes. He needs 270 to win the election. (My own estimate would be that if the election were today, then Romney would take 206 electoral votes.)</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>The guy behind the counter at Subway is as likely to be accurate at predicting political outcomes as Dick Morris. Dick Morris, however, is far more entertaining.</p>",
  "<p>It was a better day for the defence. Standard Chartered's share price rebounded 7%. Sir Mervyn King criticised the New York state department of financial services (DFS) for going solo before an investigation by five agencies has been concluded.</p> <p>The bank's chief executive, Peter Sands, sounding variously indignant and bemused, did a good job of presenting his case that Standard Chartered's indiscretions were tiny \u2013 a matter of a few millions of dollars arising from administrative errors.</p> <p>Ultimately, though, we are no closer to the heart of the matter since the central question is whose interpretation of US laws on \"U-turn\" transactions is correct.</p> <p>These laws, remember, involve transactions initiated offshore by non-Iranian foreign banks and only passing through the US on their way to other non-Iranian foreign banks. The New York DFS reckons there were dodgy transactions totalling $250bn; the bank, arguing the department is \"incorrect as a matter of law,\" says $14m.</p> <p>So Standard Chartered is either guilty of monstrous deception or is virtually squeaky clean. And the truly baffling part of the tale is how, after two full years of investigation, the two sides could still be arguing about the technical meaning of a law. Shouldn't that have been sorted out in the first week, or at least the first month?</p> <p>It's too late now, but King is right \u2013 the DFS should not have broken ranks and gone public before basic legal points have been settled.</p>",
  "<p>You know you're getting old when art historians start looking young. Thank God James Fox actually is. For all his accomplishments and authority, he's only 30 (another sign that you're getting old is when 60-year-olds appear youthful).</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01l9mf8\" title=\"\"><strong>A History of Art in Three Colours</strong></a> (BBC4) finishes with white. I am innately suspicious of attempts by art history programmes to find a tickling theme. I feel like I'm being sucked into the meeting at which it was decided that telling a story in any sensible way \u2013 chronologically, for instance, or by movement, or by broad historical context, or by technique \u2013 was way too obvious. Wouldn't it be more interesting to find four painters who all slept with the same person, or nine sculptors who were all missing a thumb? Then before you know it, the presenter is dressing up as a hooker or strapping down his own thumb to show you how hard it is to handle stone with only four fingers, and it's demonstrative and patronising, a little bit like watching <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/nina-and-the-neurons/\" title=\"\">Nina and the Neurons</a> on CBeebies, which is at least intended for the under-fives.</p> <p>But there is another way to do things, it turns out, whether with the collusion of the producers or by slipping it under the wire, I know not. Fox principally uses the colour to tell some stories that interest him. Pretty well everything interests him, and pretty well everything he says is interesting.</p> <p>He makes a decent stab, at the very start, to thread his tales together, so that they coagulate into a solid notion: that white \"might just be the darkest colour of them all,\" that it has been used over centuries to \"control and conquer\". But I wasn't buying it. Sure, sometimes it's dark; sometimes it isn't. There was no need to overplay this hand, but anyway, that is a minor complaint.</p> <p>We start at the Elgin marbles, whose story is told with admirable pace and drama: \"In 1938, the director of the British Museum was on his evening rounds. Everything seemed to be in order, but a disturbing incident had been taking place right beneath his feet.\" I'm afraid I cannot tell you whether the suspense came from artful pausing, or just a nice, posh, HG Wells, Radio 4, understatedly-serious, we-are-now-at-war-with-Germany accent. I simply surrendered to its message: something really exciting is just about to happen!</p> <p>In fact, the disturbing incident was quite subtle. People were cleaning \u2013 for which read ruining \u2013 the marbles, having become obsessed with the idea that white was their perfect colour. (In fact, the marbles started off painted many colours.) The idea, if you are prepared to trace it back 221 years, commenced with the birth of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Joachim_Winckelmann\" title=\"\">Johann Joachim Winckelmann</a>, son of a humble something or other who \u2013 being gay and favouring tight leather trousers \u2013 naturally yearned for the big city, where he saw a room full of sculptures, \"of all shapes and sizes,\" Fox says, as&#xa0;the camera zooms in on a moustache. \"There was plenty to feast his eyes on. Buttocks aplenty, ripped, muscular torsos and even the odd genital. They were the most wonderful objects Winckelmann had ever seen,\" Fox tells us.</p> <p>Thus, the world's first Hellenist was made, and he was the one who wanted everything white. I guess the needling pop-psychological subtext \u2013 that Winckelmann elided the colour of the marbles with the colour of purity in a bid to ratify his sexual awakening \u2013 that bit you can take or leave. The trajectory itself is fascinating, however: how one version of beauty can come to dominate a huge swathe of culture, for centuries, by the sheer force of one man's will.</p> <p>Fox goes on to do a great job on Whistler, who uses white to \"mock Victorian taste\" by the subtle measure of painting a series of women in white. The scandal and bafflement were the talk of the town. Why was this one standing on a bear? Is she married? Why does she look so unhappy? (I can't believe this would have raised too many questions). Whistler underlined this by wearing white trousers around town. If only they'd had blogs in those days, someone could have done lookatmyfuckingwhitetrousers and divided them into sailor, mental health nurse and Whistlerite (that will only make sense if you look at <a href=\"http://lookatmyfuckingredtrousers.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">this website</a>, but you won't regret it.</p> <p>It was interesting, memorable, thought-provoking and lingering.</p>",
  "<p>As the whistle blew at the end of Britain's semi-final against Argentina, the pitch looked like a call to prayer. Every single one of the GB players fell to their knees, their heads cast down, each one alone in their grief. They had given their all but finished on the wrong end of a 2-1 scoreline. Instead of appearing in their first Olympic final on Friday, it is Argentina who will play the Netherlands for gold, and Britain will now face New Zealand in a play-off for bronze.</p> <p>The defeat was made harder by the fact that an obvious infringement preceding Argentina's second goal had been ignored by the umpire. Britain were obstructed in the field before Carla Rebecchi made her bolt to the goalmouth and manoeuvred the ball skillfully around the keeper Beth Storry. But their animated calls for a TV referral were rejected because it had occurred outside of the 23m line.</p> <p>Speaking after the match with a catch in his voice, Danny Kerry, the British coach, said that the issue had been raised in technical meetings before the tournament. \"We were ensured that common sense would prevail,\" he said. \"But it hasn't.</p> <p>\"Everyone knew [about the obstruction], the millions on TV, 16,000 in the crowd, 22 players on the pitch, everyone. But unfortunately the law as it is written meant it couldn't be referred. And it's a shame, because it's one of our biggest nights for our sport.\"</p> <p>Political grudges had been put aside, but Britain's showdown with Argentina was always going to be a tough one. Argentina are the World Cup holders and No2 side in the world, and defeated Britain in the final of the Champions Trophy in February. They also have unfinished Olympic business, having stood on the podium at the past three Games and never won the gold.</p> <p>Meanwhile Britain's women seemed to suffer a reversal of form as their pool matches progressed, and had not won a game since last Thursday. They received a stern talking to from Kerry after their last game for playing too passively. They could not be accused of that here \u2013 they spent much of the 70 minutes inside Argentina's half, and most of it with the ball \u2013 but still found themselves a goal down within five minutes, after the ball came off Georgi Twigg's foot in the circle and Noel Barrionuevo stepped up to take the penalty corner. Their corner specialist has not been firing recently but made no mistake here, scoring only her second goal of the tournament with a shot between Crista Cullen's feet.</p> <p>Britain responded with pace, but lacked precision. Passes were sent to empty space in the midfield, and their only first-half shot on goal came from Alex Danson after 25 minutes, a reverse slapshot that required a feat of physical contortion as she held off the defender behind her, and just slid off the side of the goal. While Argentina looked solid in defence, GB looked flustered, and when Rebecchi stretched her legs from the left-hand corner, there was no one but the keeper to stop her.</p> <p>If Kerry did administer another rollicking at half-time, it certainly worked. Fifty seconds into the second half, an attack on goal by Twigg and Ball earned a penalty corner, but Cullen's shot was bravely blocked by Macarena Rodriguez Perez.</p> <p>For all their forward press, Britain could not score. When Helen Richardson, the sweetest striker in the team, took delivery of a pass a mere 15 yards out, a goal seemed almost certain: two Argentinian defenders had been caught out of position and only the keeper stood between her and the goal. Richardson took her time \u2013 then scuffed the ball along the ground.</p> <p>She looked distraught, but not yet haunted. Five minutes remained when Richardson crossed the ball from a free hit, skidding it across the D into Danson's reversed, outstretched stick. The ball hit the backboard \u2013 the crowd erupted out of their nervous silence. Suddenly the game was on. Then, just as suddenly, it was over.</p> <p>While admitting it was a \"bitter, bitter disappointment\" for the team, who left the pitch in tears, Kerry stressed that he was proud of his players' efforts. \"I thought that Argentina offered little but a bit of a dribble and we pretty much outplayed them,\" he said. \"The reason for not winning was the half chances and not converting the opportunity. But I couldn't have asked any more from the girls.\"</p> <p>This semi-final appearance had already marked GB's best result since 1996, and a major step up from the Beijing Games when they came sixth, and from Athens where they did not qualify at all. But that will be little comfort for a team that had set its sights on gold, and begun this tournament with three unbeaten games.</p> <p>Kate Walsh, the GB captain, said that even with seconds to go, the team never stopped believing they would score an equaliser. \"Everybody's devastated,\" she said. \"But believe you me, we will get up for that bronze medal game.\"</p>",
  "<p>American aid to the country once called Zaire appeared to have an amazing effect.</p> <p>The more the US gave its ruler, Mobutu Sese Seko, the shorter Zaire's roads seemed to get. By the time Mobutu was overthrown in 1997, after two decades of American and other western largesse, his country had just about one tenth of the paved roads it had had at independence in the early Sixties. Once US aid shrank, the roads started getting longer again.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/01/hillary-clinton-africa-china\">began a tour of Africa this month with a thinly veiled warning</a> that China is out to plunder the continent and its governments would do well to huddle under the protective wing of America's commitment to freedom. Clinton told an audience in Senegal that, unlike other countries:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"America will stand up for democracy and universal human rights even when it might be easier to look the other way and keep the resources flowing.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>She didn't mention China by name, but everyone got the message. The US secretary of state is getting at a point made by other critics of Beijing's role in Africa: that China is so hungry for resources it does deals with authoritarian regimes and doles out aid without consideration of issues such as good governance. </p> <p>That sounds an awful lot like what the US and its allies got up to for decades \u2013 with the difference that Chinese aid does sometimes deliver something tangible, such as thousands of kilometres of new roads in the former Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo. Whereas US aid mostly disappeared into Mobutu's buoyant bank accounts, or was used to buy off the army to keep him in power, China's deal with the DRC government \u2013 trading thousands of kilometres of new roads and rehabilitated railway track for copper and other minerals \u2013 is transforming lives by linking up parts of the country cut off from each other for decades except by air.</p> <p>None of this happened with US and western money. US aid to Mobutu was tied up with the cold war, his support of US-backed rebels fighting Angola's Marxist government and his general hostility to communism. Barely a word was said \u2013 by successive US administrations \u2013 about Mobutu's dire human rights record. Few questions were asked about how, despite the billions of dollars thrown at Kinshasa, Mobutu went on getting richer while the people he ruled got poorer and his country's infrastructure fell apart.</p> <p>Mobutu was always welcome at Ronald Reagan's White House, where the president called him \"a voice of good sense and goodwill\". Only after the end of the cold war did US policy shift. Washington didn't need Mobutu anymore. Finally, it could afford to talk about principles without much cost.</p> <p>It was much the same story with western aid to Rwanda. Hundreds of millions were poured into the tiny country, with France leading the way, to support a regime that would ultimately resort to genocide in an attempt to hang on to power. Yet, it took the Chinese to lift towns such as Kibuye out of their isolation.</p> <p>Kibuye is just 120km, or 75 miles, west from Rwanda's capital, Kigali. Twenty years ago, the journey was as much as an eight-hour drive, depending on the rains and on whether, as seemed to happen most days, a bus or lorry was stuck in the deep muddy ravines that opened up on what could only be loosely described as a road. China's road-builders changed all that, and the journey now is well under two hours \u2013 with all the benefits to trade, education and family life that brings.</p> <p>The pattern across Africa was US support for ideological allies, which included Washington siding with the apartheid regime in South Africa while banning Nelson Mandela's ANC as a terrorist organisation. It also entailed funding of wars against opponents. Human rights and democracy were too often buried under the needs of cold war realpolitik, as Washington saw them.</p> <p>US officials argue that \"that was then\", and it's different now. But is it? For sure, Washington will make a stand on \"democracy and universal human rights\" where it does not conflict in a major way with other interests. But where money or security are involved it's another matter.</p> <p>Take Equatorial Guinea. Washington had plenty of public criticism for its appalling and bloodstained dictator, Teodoro Obiang Nguema, who has ruled since 1979. The US even pulled out its ambassador, John Bennett, in 1993 after he was accused of being a witch on state radio and threatened with violence. In his departure speech, Bennett named the regime's worst torturers and Washington closed the embassy three years later. Then, large reserves of oil were discovered in the 1990s: American companies started pumping and everything changed.</p> <p>Or take Ethiopia. The US is the largest contributor of aid to Addis Ababa, which has been ruled by the same man, Meles Zenawi, for 20 years. He's received billions of dollars in aid, since American largesse rose sharply after the 9/11 attacks (from a little more than $200m a year to close to $1bn) because Washington came to regard Ethiopia as a frontline in the \"war on terror\", owing to the presence of Islamist fighters in neighbouring Somalia. The CIA also used Ethiopia as a <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2007/4/5/outsourced_guantanamo_fbi_cia_interrogating_detainees\">base for the secret interrogation of hundreds of detainees</a> abducted from other countries, which was likely to have involved torture.</p> <p>While some of that aid money has benefited ordinary people, a Human Rights Watch report two years ago said Zenawi was \"using aid to build a single-party state\". It accused the ruling Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Democratic Front of exercising \"total control of local and district administrators to monitor and intimidate individuals at household level\" and charged that foreign governments, including the US, were colluding in this repression.</p> <p><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/9556288.stm\">A BBC investigation last year exposed</a> how \"the Ethiopian government is using billions of dollars of development aid as a tool for political oppression.\" It reported that villages failing to support Zenawi are starved of food, seeds and fertiliser.</p> <p>For all of Clinton's assurances, the US still finds it easier to look the other way.</p>",

But it is slowly healing. Many of the conditions necessary for a recovery are in place, and the monetary policy committee [MPC] will continue to do all it can to bring about that recovery.</p> <p>\"As I have said many times, the recovery and rebalancing of our economy will be a long, slow process. It is to our Olympic team that we should look for inspiration. They have shown us the importance of total commitment when trying to achieve a goal that may lie some years ahead.\"</p> <p>King said it would take a \"bit of time\" to assess the impact of the Bank's new <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jul/13/george-osborne-funding-for-lending-scheme?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">funding for lending scheme</a> (FLS), which came into force last week and is designed to encourage banks to lend more at lower interest rates. Last month, Threadneedle Street announced a \u00a350bn increase in its QE programme to \u00a3375bn by November, and the governor said further purchases of government gilts to create money were an option.</p> <p>Chancellor George Osborne said the government had an opportunity to give \"110% attention and effort and energy to getting the economy moving.\"</p> <p>He said: \"I think the governor is right on the big picture, which is the economy is healing, but it is a slow and difficult process and we're dealing with some very deep-rooted problems at home and some storms from abroad.\"</p> <p>On the foreign exchanges, the pound rose slightly after King expressed strong reservations about cutting the bank rate from its historic low of 0.5%. The governor said there was a risk that such a move could prove counterproductive by making life more difficult for some banks and building societies.</p> <p>Vicky Redwood, UK analyst at Capital Economics, said it would not take much to tip the nine-strong MPC towards further action. \"We expect another \u00a350bn [of QE] to be announced in November when the current purchases are completed.\"</p> <p>King strongly defended the Bank's forecasting record against accusations that it had persistently been over-optimistic about growth, pointing to a euro crisis that \"goes on and on and on\" as the reason for the latest downgrade.</p> <p>He said tumbling inflation would eventually boost consumer spending by raising real incomes, while the FLS was \"bigger and bolder than any initiative so far tried to get the banks lending again\".</p> <p>Labour seized on the admission in the inflation report that banks might use the FLS to inflate their profits rather than lowering interest rates, and said it was time for a Plan B on the economy.</p> <p>Rachel Reeves MP, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"With growth forecasts slashed yet again, not just this year but in future years too, it is clear that we cannot go on with the same failing plan from this government. The chancellor's policies aren't only causing short-term pain, but long-term damage to our economy too. And despite the crisis in the eurozone, Britain is just one of two G20 countries in a double-dip recession.\"</p> <p>King said the Bank found it difficult to explain why the jobs market had been so resilient at a time when official figures have shown the economy deep in a double-dip recession. Threadneedle Street has lowered its longer-term growth projections for the economy in the belief that there has been permanent damage caused by the deepest and longest downturn since the second world war.</p> <p>John Hawksworth, chief economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: \"It seems likely that we have entered a 'new normal' period where growth will be relatively subdued by historic standards for some years to come as the banking system remains impaired and global commodity prices remain relatively high and volatile.\"</p>",
  "<p>New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has unveiled a new crime-fighting system developed with Microsoft \u2013 and revealed that the city will take a cut of the profits if it is sold to other administrations.</p> <p>The innovation, which bears a passing resemblance to the futuristic hologram data screens used by Tom Cruise in the science fiction film Minority Report, will allow police to quickly collate and visualise vast amounts of data from cameras, licence plate readers, 911 calls, police databases and other sources.</p> <p>It will then display the information in real time, both visually and chronologically, allowing investigators to centralise information about crimes as they happen or are reported. \"It is a one-stop shop for law enforcement,\" Bloomberg said at a City Hall press conference unveiling the new technology.</p> <p>But, though it has many screens, maps, and flashing visuals that make it look like science fiction, the new technology has a distinctly un-Hollywood name: the <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_prevention/public_security_privacy_guidelines.pdf\">Domain Awareness System</a>. Developed by Microsoft engineers working with New York police officers, DAS will allow a host of activities to be carried out, such as spotting a suspicious vehicle and being able to track its recent movements or use cameras to track back and see who left a suspicious package. </p> <p>It features live video feeds, huge databases of recent crime patterns and can take input direct from the field in real time via things like 911 calls or police radios. \"All the information is presented visually and geographically and in chronological context,\" said police commissioner Ray Kelly.</p> <p>But there is more to the new system than just fighting crime in a city that has in recent decades shed a once fearsome reputation to become one of the safest big metropolitan areas in America. Part of the deal with Microsoft will result in the city of New York taking a 30% cut on any profits that the computer firm gets from selling the technology to other cities in America or around the world. </p> <p>\"Maybe we can make a few bucks,\" Bloomberg said. \"It is a great example of what the public and private sector can do to improve people's lives when we work together.\"</p> <p>Such partnerships with the private sector, especially in sensitive areas like law enforcement, are not without their critics who are concerned about introducing a profit motive into the traditional domain of public social policy. But they are becoming a Bloomberg specialism. </p> <p>He recently announced an agreement with investment bank Goldman Sachs to issue a loan, called a \"social impact bond\", that will fund a scheme to cut re-offending rates among young people leaving New York's notorious Rikers Island jail. If the scheme beats certain targets of youth behaviour Goldman could make several million dollars of profit.</p>",
  "<p>The ruling against Cait Riley and Jamieson Wilson (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/aug/06/unpaid-work-scheme-ruled-lawful-poundland?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Unpaid work schemes ruled lawful as high court rejects Poundland case</a>, 6 August) that the government's workfare schemes are legal sets a dark precedent for unemployed and working people. Whatever the courts say, workfare is a violation of human rights. Judge Foskett said in his ruling that \"characterising such a scheme as involving or being analogous to 'slavery' or 'forced labour' seems to me to be a long way from contemporary thinking\". This is of course the case if by \"contemporary thinking\" you mean the thinking of the 1%, of the government and big business.</p> <p>Workfare isn't just bad for the unemployed, it's bad for all of us. There's no incentive to take people on with existing pay, terms and conditions. This will only accelerate the race to the bottom, where we are all forced to accept worse standards to compete in the labour market. But the campaign against workfare has already won victories. Many companies have dropped out of the scheme and the government has already made a climbdown over sanctions. We achieved this without the help of the courts. We will continue to build a mass campaign of unemployed people and trade unionists to bring these schemes down. The economic crisis was caused by the bankers and super-rich. Yet the government now uses this as a cover to unleash a brutal austerity programme to cut our jobs and services.</p> <p>We will also continue to fight for genuine solutions to the scourge of unemployment. Big business has around \u00a3800bn in its vaults. That money should be used for job creation. We call for investment in the public sector, including a programme of public works to create training and socially useful jobs that offer a living wage.<br><strong>Paul Callanan </strong><a href=\"http://www.youthfightforjobs.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Youth Fight for Jobs and Education</em></a><em>,</em><strong> Bob Crow </strong><a href=\"http://www.rmt.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Rail Maritime and Transport union</em></a><em>,</em><strong> Matt Wrack </strong><a href=\"http://www.fbu.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Fire Brigades Union</em></a><em>, </em><strong>Steve Hedley </strong><a href=\"http://www.rmt.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Rail Maritime and Transport union</em></a><em>,</em><strong> Billy Hayes </strong><a href=\"http://www.cwu.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Communication Workers Union</em></a><em>,</em><strong> Gerry Morrissey </strong><a href=\"http://www.bectu.org.uk/home\" title=\"\"><em>Broadcast Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Great Britain has won more gold medals in different sports than any country bar China \u2013 and has even bettered the USA's total at London 2012. With the host nation standing third in the overall medal table, it suggests investment in expanding the breadth of sports capable of achieving medals is paying off.</p> <p>While the sports that powered Britain's surge up the medal table in Beijing have all delivered again in London, a host of new disciplines have joined them. Their success has meant Britain's Olympic gold medals have come across 10 sports, while the USA's greater total number of golds have been spread across nine different sporting disciplines.</p> <p>At the Greenwich Park equestrian arena, Team GB this week won their first ever dressage gold and their first team showjumping gold since 1952. And at the Lee Valley white-water rafting course, Etienne Stott and Tim Baillie secured Britain's first ever canoe slalom gold, in the C2 class.</p> <p>While the 22 gold medals have come in 10 different sports, the 541-strong team has won 48 medals in 14 sports in total. The tally has taken the team past the 19 golds and 47 overall won in Beijing, making it the most successful showing by a British team since 1908. They have also achieved the British Olympic Association's aim of winning \"more medals in more sports than in over a century\". Already, Britain has won gold in athletics, canoe slalom, road and track cycling, equestrian, rowing, sailing, shooting, tennis and the&#xa0;triathlon.</p> <p>Given that Britain can still claim a first gold medal of these Games in boxing, open-water swimming, diving, hockey, BMX and taekwondo there is a good chance that they will still be ahead of the USA on the&#xa0;measure by the closing ceremony. Taking medals of all hues into account, Great Britain and the USA are neck and neck \u2013 both have recorded medals in 14&#xa0;sports.</p> <p>The spread of success will further strengthen the hand of British officials looking to ensure that the huge investment in British Olympic sport in the run up to London is continued through to the next Games in Rio. UK Sport, the body responsible for investing \u00a3312m of Lottery and&#xa0;exchequer funding into Olympic sports since 2008, has resolved to broaden&#xa0;the spread of sports able to win&#xa0;medals.</p> <p>It will target its investment according to its ruthless \"no compromise\" funding formula. That means sports unlikely to win medals over the next two Games will see their funding cut but those able to prove they are capable of making the podium could get an even bigger slice of the available money.</p> <p>Liz Nicholl, UK Sport's chief executive, told the Guardian that the fact that medals had been achieved across more sports than at any Games since 1908 proved its formula was working. She said it had enabled sports that have not traditionally won medals to learn from those such as sailing and rowing that have.</p> <p>\"The mission 2012 approach has really helped because there is a lot more learning between sports than before. There has been some really good sharing across sports and a collective ambition to do well,\" Nicholl said. \"We knew the ambition had to be to increase the number of sports in return for the increased funding they received.\"</p> <p>She picked out hockey and triathlon as two sports that had delivered in London as a result and said the silver medal in the men's team gymnastics underlined its impact on minority sports. UK Sport invested around \u00a3550m of Lottery and exchequer funding in British sport over the Beijing and London cycles and is keen to preserve the same level of support for the next four years.</p> <p>If funding is preserved at or slightly below the current level, UK Sport has vowed to target a medal total in Rio de Janeiro that would ensure Great Britain becomes the first host in recent years not to experience a drop-off after its own Games.</p> <p>Nicholl accepted the gold rush in London would make it tough, but said it could be achieved.</p> <p>Lord Moynihan, the BOA chairman, said that a comprehensive review of funding for British sport should follow the Olympic Games, followed by a long-term commitment at elite and grassroots levels. \"These athletes have inspired a generation, we have to translate that inspiration into participation. We have to look carefully at the delivery mechanisms across sport,\" he said.</p> <p>\"And we must come away from these Games with committed funding to enable participation and excellence to build from here and not to go backwards. We need a really detailed review at all levels.\"</p> <p>Moynihan said that politicians \"owed it to the athletes\" to ensure that funding levels were maintained. \"A strong financial platform doesn't deliver medals but it provides the springboard for an athlete with outstanding talent to provide their best,\" he said.</p> <p>Team GB's chef de mission, Andy Hunt, said the focus for the remainder of the Games remained ensuring that athletes were in a position to win as many medals as possible. \"It has been an extraordinary 12 days of sport and I'm massively proud of what Team GB has achieved so far. We're not done yet.</p> <p>\"We still have athletes who have not competed yet, [and] we want their experience to be the same as every other athlete who has gone on to. It is superb where we're up to, [but] the time for celebrating is after every athlete is done. Right now it is about making sure they have every chance of success.\"</p>",
  "<p>State officials in Louisiana have ordered a school to change a policy that forces students who are \"suspected\" of being pregnant to take a pregnancy test, and for banning them from class if the results are confirmed.</p> <p>Civil liberties campaigners highlighted the policy at the Delhi Charter School, saying it was discriminatory and unconstitutional. Commentators expressed concern that any student merely \"suspected\" of being pregnant could be forced to take a test.</p> <p>State officials ordered the school to change its policy within a week or face sanction. \"We request that you immediately revise your policy,\" the Louisiana state department of education said in a <a href=\"http://ftpcontent.worldnow.com/klfy/PregnancyPolicy_080612.pdf \">statement on Tuesday night</a>.</p> <p>The edict followed a <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/blog/womens-rights-lgbt-rights-religion-belief-reproductive-freedom/get-tested-or-get-out-school\">complaint from the American Civil Liberties Union</a> which highlighted the case, saying the state-funded school was breaking the law. \"This is in blatant violation of federal law and the US constitution.\"</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.delhicharterschool.org/www/dcscharter/site/hosting/Delhi_Charter_school_policy_manual.html\">school manual's \"student pregnancy policy\"</a>, students suspected of being pregnant must be tested. Those who test positive \"will not be permitted to attend class on the campus\" and instead be required to study at home. \"Any student who is suspected of being pregnant and who refuses to submit to a pregnancy test shall be treated as a pregnant student and will be offered home study opportunities. If home study opportunities are not acceptable, the student will be counseled to seek other educational opportunities.\"</p> <p>Marjorie Esman, executive director of the ACLU, said in a letter the policy violated the Education Amendments and Equal Protection Clause by excluding students from class on the basis of sex. The manual says nothing about male students who father children. </p> <p>\"What a school should do is treat pregnancy as any other medical condition and allow the student to participate fully in anything that she's medically capable of participating in,\" said Esman's letter.</p> <p>The policy presumed a pregnant student was unable to continue to attend class and violated the right to procreate and to decide whether to continue or terminate a pregnancy, she said. It also perpetuated \"the archaic and pernicious stereotype that a girl's pregnancy sets a 'bad example' for her peers\".</p> <p>The school did not immediately respond to a Guardian interview request on Wednesday but earlier in a<a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/lousisana-charter-school-file-aclu-draconian-pregnancy-policy-girls-test-positive-kicked-article-1.1130710#ixzz22uEKPLQE\"> statement to the Daily News</a> the principal, Chris Broussard, said the school had contracted lawyers to help review its policy.</p> <p>\"There have never been any complaints from students or parents about the school's policy. However, in light of the recent inquiry, the current policy has been forwarded to the law firm of Davenport, Files &amp; Kelly in Monroe, La., to ensure that necessary revisions are made so that our school is in full compliance with the constitutional law.\"</p> <p>The ACLU noted that around 70% of teenage girls who gave birth left school, partly because of illegal discrimination. \"Schools should be supporting pregnant and parenting teens that face numerous barriers to completing their education, not illegally excluding them from school.\"</p> <p>Another policy in the school's 216-page manual which caught attention was \"reasonable corporal punishment of unruly students\", defined as \"paddling of the student's buttocks\".</p> <p>Public displays of affection were banned because they showed \"disdain for good taste\".

(And yes, we are aware of the irony that by reporting these reports, were are contributing further to this imbalance.)</p> <p>Off air since 10 February 2006, rumors of the Arrested Development resurrection bounced around until November 2011, when it was announced that a 10-episode fourth season would be released on Netflix in 2013, to be followed by a movie. </p> <p>Updates on the show's progress have been few and far between, but when they come through, they set off the sort of impassioned response one would expect from the news that a dead relative had been brought back to life. And for fans of AD, that is a lot what it's like. </p> <p>When Arrested Development originally aired on Fox, its offbeat humor compelled committed fans to tell everyone they knew: \"You have to watch this show.\" Those pleas became more desperate as the Emmy-winning program faced cancellation with the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/16/tv-ratings-nielsen_n_927832.html\">average episode getting a paltry 6m viewers</a>. </p> <p>After its cancellation, those pleas didn't end, and the show gained a greater audience as people finally followed through with their friends' recommendations and watched it on DVD, Netflix and Hulu, where each of the just over 20-minute episodes are still available for viewing today.</p> <p>The show is based on the innocuous, and very 2000s, premise of a single father (Bateman) taking care of the family business and the family after his father is imprisoned for dubious corporate leadership.</p> <p>This family happens to be highly dysfunctional, and the show's absurd and alienating humor cemented it as a cult-hit with gags including: never-nudes, a staircar, the Blue Man group, Saddam Hussein look-a-likes, a corn baller, Liza Minelli, a hook hand, hot cops and the always-profitable banana stand. </p> <p>The season four episodes are set to be released all in one productivity-limiting day next year, and the newest update from set likely elicited such joy because the day people have been waiting more than six years for is becoming a more tangible reality. </p> <p>Bluth family members weren't the only ones to leak information from the set.

  "<p>\"It's a common thing,\" says Balvinder Kaur Saund, a Labour councillor for the London Borough of Redbridge and chair of the Sikh Women's Alliance, \"to walk through an estate in [some parts of east London] and young boys throw stones and shout 'Taliban' at you. I have seen that myself.\" She was once with a man \u2013 a Sikh who wore a turban \u2013 when some youths shouted \"Osama\" at him. \"I wanted to retaliate but he said 'Just ignore it and carry on walking'.\" She thinks many more incidents go&#xa0;unreported.</p> <p>The terrible events in Wisconsin at the weekend, where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/06/sikh-temple-shooting-wisconsin-police\" title=\"\">a gunman</a> shot dead six people at a gurdwara, is an extreme, and thankfully rare, attack, but there are numerous instances of Sikhs being targeted in the US and the UK. The first victim of a backlash against Muslims in America after 9/11 was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/17/us/sikh-owner-of-gas-station-is-fatally-shot-in-rampage.html\" title=\"\">Balbir Singh Sodhi</a>, a Sikh who was shot dead. There have been other physical attacks on people, and on gurdwaras. In March this year in the US, a letter was sent to a Sikh family \u2013 addressed to the \"Turban Family\" \u2013 claiming to know they had links to the Taliban. Mitt Romney, potentially the next president of the US, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/08/romney-slips-refers-to-shooting-site-as-sheik-temple/\" title=\"\">twice referred to Sikhs as \"sheikhs\"</a> in expressing his condolences over the temple shooting.</p> <p>After the London bombings in 2005, a gurdwara in Kent was firebombed, and another in Leeds. After 9/11, former Metropolitan police officer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jan/09/race.world1\" title=\"\">Gurpal Virdi</a> remembers: \"I dealt with a lot of complaints \u2013 we had attacks on individuals, even on women. When it happened, I was going around stations to tell the officers the differences between the Taliban and a Sikh because they didn't know either. And this is London, a multicultural area. It doesn't help when they kept showing images of [Osama Bin Laden] and in the UK, it's&#xa0;the Sikhs who wear a&#xa0;turban.\"</p> <p>And then there are the everyday occurrences witnessed by Balvinder Kaur Saund, where Sikh men in particular are eyed suspiciously, as if they are proud members of al-Qaida.</p> <p>Varinder Singh, co-founder of the <a href=\"http://www.turbancampaign.com/updates/\" title=\"\">Turban Campaign</a>, which tries to counter negative reporting of the Sikh community, says: \"Racism has always existed, but certainly September 11 didn't help. It created a suspicion of the Sikh community, particularly because of the appearance of the male members. Inevitably that leads to physical and verbal attacks, but I think the recent attacks in America are a step beyond that. That was deliberate and I think the argument of mistaken identity can't really be used here \u2013 there were big signs outside saying 'Sikh temple'. I think a general hatred has developed. Islamophobia is rife and applies to everyone of colour, regardless of religious background. In the eyes of people who wish to hate or belong to fascist organisations you are the enemy and seen as a potential target. In this country, there is a lot of emphasis placed on extremism in certain corners of the Muslim community, however the government and councils tend to overlook far-right organisations such as the English Defence League.\"</p> <p>In May, the EDL tried to ally itself with the Sikh community by hijiacking a Sikh protest in Luton outside a police station after allegations that a Sikh woman had been raped by a Muslim man. \"When we see groups such as the EDL try to align themselves with the Sikh community, it's a relationship that can't last,\" says Varinder Singh. \"This is a move to isolate the Muslim community who need our support.\"</p> <p>Is there a danger that in trying to differentiate themselves from Muslims \u2013 and there have been historical tensions between some Sikhs and Muslims \u2013 Sikhs are themselves contributing to Islamophobia? \"It does happen and it is dangerous,\" says Sabby Dhalu, joint secretary of Unite Against Fascism. \"When I put the argument to people, a lot of them agree with me in opposing Islamophobia and the need to work with Muslims. It's all the more reason for the decent majority to speak out.\"</p>",
  "<p>On Saturday 28 July 2012, Wade Michael Page walked into the Shooters Shop in Wisconsin to buy a 9mm semi-automatic handgun, and ammunition. Eight days later, the 40-year-old military veteran arrived at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek and began shooting at members of the congregation who had gathered to prepare a meal. During the shooting, six members of the Sikh community, one police officer and the attacker were killed.&#xa0;</p> <p>Within hours of the shootings, the <a href=\"http://www.splcenter.org/\" title=\"\">Southern Poverty Law Centre (SPLC)</a> revealed that Page was a known white supremacist. He had links to networks including the Hammerskin Nation and was involved in an underground music scene often referred to as \"white power music\" or \"hate rock\". Influenced strongly by earlier bands in England such as Skrewdriver, white power music is seen by those who study extremism as one of the most important recruitment tools for the modern far right. Page's involvement appears to have been deep: in an interview with online music magazine Label56.com in 2005, he claimed to have sold all of his possessions so that he could travel around the country attending white power festivals such as Hammerfest. The next year he formed a band called End Apathy recruiting bandmates from the other groups such as Definite Hate and 13 Knots. Asked in 2005 to elaborate on the meaning of the band's lyrics, Page replied: \"The topics vary from sociological issues, religion, and how the value of human life has been degraded by being submissive to tyranny and hypocrisy that we are subjugated to.\"</p> <p>Page's body also contained references to white supremacism. A tattoo of the number \"14\" was a direct reference to the so-called \"14 words\" that occupy a central role in neo-Nazi vocabulary: \"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.\" This passage, a reference to a section of Mein Kampf, was popularised by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lane_%28white_nationalist%29\" title=\"\">David Lane</a>, a member of white supremacist terror group The Order. Another tattoo of the Odin or Celtic cross represents one of the most popular symbols among neo-Nazis, seen as the international symbol for \"white pride\". Those who had been close to Page confirmed his ideological affinity to the extreme right. Reflecting a wider belief within the movement, an old army friend of Page claimed that as far back as the 90s he had talked about \"racial holy war\", and would rant \"about mostly any non-white person\".&#xa0;</p> <p>As with the aftermath of the attacks by Anders Breivik in Norway, it was not long until sympathisers surfaced online. \"Take your dead and go back to India and dump their ashes in the Ganges, Sikhs,\" wrote one neo-Nazi. Others praised their \"brother\": \"All I feel is loss and sympathy for a brother that was overwhelmed by pain and frustration. I could [sic] care less though for those injured and wounded other than Wade.\" Another warned of future attacks: \"There are thousands of other angry White men like Page, the vast majority of them unknown ... When will they, like Page, reach their breaking point...?\"</p> <p>The threat of violence from disgruntled rightwing extremists is not lost on the security services, or analysts. In 2009, Daryl Johnson, an analyst at the Department for Homeland Security, <a href=\"www.fas.org/irp/eprint/rightwing.pdf\" title=\"Right-Wing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment [PDF]\">authored a report</a> that explicitly warned of the growing threat of far-right violence. Pointing to the economic downturn, the election of Barack Obama and evidence that some military veterans were struggling to re-integrate into civilian life, the report was one of the first to flag the growing importance of the extreme right \u2013 a movement that was routinely overlooked after 9/11. Few, however, took the warning seriously. Rather, Republicans and rightwing commentators <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/apr/16/right-wing-extremism-alarm/?page=all\" title=\"\">openly criticised the report</a>. Some saw it as an attempt to discredit the insurgent and right-wing Tea Party movement while many viewed it as an unfair attack on military veterans. Others said it focused unnecessarily on domestic rather than foreign manifestations of terrorism.</p> <p>But Johnson (who was later shunted into a different department) was not wrong. Following Wisconsin, some analysts reminded commentators that the far right is responsible for as many \u2013 if not more \u2013 attacks on US soil than religious-based extremists, and now poses the most significant domestic security threat. Indeed, prior to 9/11 the most damaging act of terrorism within the US was the bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma by militia sympathiser Timothy McVeigh, which resulted in 168 deaths and more than 800 injuries. Between 1990 and 2010 the far right committed 145 ideologically motivated homicide incidents in the US. Of these incidents, excluding the bombing in Oklahoma City, far-right extremists killed 180 people.</p> <p>The data suggests that American far right groups have grown \"explosively\", which is attributed to a potent combination of public anxieties over the financial crisis, the growth of conspiracy theories, the exploitation of fears over non-white immigration and the prospect of Obama securing a second term in office.</p> <p>According to the SPLC, in 2011 the number of \"hate groups\" active in the US reached 1,018, 69% more than in 2000. The most striking growth has been within the \"patriot\" scene, which contains anti-government groups that cling to conspiracy theories and view the government as enemy number one. There were fewer than 150 of these (mostly inactive) groups in 2000. By 2011, there were almost 1,300. In fact, since 2009 this particular variant of the far right has grown at a rate of 755%.</p> <p>While it is difficult to compare across borders, similar warnings have been voiced in Europe. Last year, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution in Germany noted that while the number of people in far-right political parties had contracted to 22,000, the number of those involved in more combative and confrontational forms of far-right politics was on the rise: the number of rightwing extremists&#xa0;with a propensity to violence had increased to 9,800; the number of followers of more violence-prone neo-Nazi groups had risen to 6,000; and the number of street-based demonstrations had reached an all-time high.</p> <p>Though less affected than other countries, from 2001 onward, authorities in the UK have similarly voiced concern over a rapidly evolving far-right scene. In recent years, at least 17 individuals who committed or planned acts of violence or terrorism, and who were linked to the far right, have been imprisoned. In 2009, the&#xa0;discovery of a network of rightwing extremists in England with access to an arsenal of weapons prompted London Metropolitan police to warn that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/jul/06/far-right-terrorism-threat-police\" title=\"\">far-right militants might attempt a \"spectacular\" attack</a>. In the same year the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/video/2010/may/28/english-defence-league-uncovered\" title=\"\">English Defence League (EDL) was born</a>, introducing a new form of far-right politics that is less interested than its predecessors in elections, and more focused on rallying support through street-based confrontation and networks that transcend national borders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394850978\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344445694649/Wisconsin-candlelight-vig-008.jpg\" alt=\"Wisconsin candlelight vigil\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A candlelight vigil following the shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, Photograph: Chris Wilson/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Wilson/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though often dismissed as alarmist, these warnings were partly validated in July 2011, when Breivik launched his politically motivated attacks in Oslo and on the island of Ut\u00f8ya. Shortly afterward, authorities in Germany discovered that a violent neo-Nazi cell \u2013 the National Socialist Underground (NSU) \u2013 had been responsible for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/nov/15/germany-neo-nazi-terror-cell-doner-killings\" title=\"\">at least a dozen murders</a>. Then, in Florence, an activist connected to the far-right group Casa Pound shot dead two immigrant street traders in an unprovoked attack. While it might be tempting to treat the attack in Wisconsin in isolation, it is actually the latest in a series of acts of violence from individuals linked to far-right groups.</p> <p>The perpetrators of these attacks are often dismissed as crazed and psychologically flawed loners. Perhaps this is because we have grown used to the security threat from religious extremists and tend to view their far-right counterparts as a loony fringe, rather than rational agents who are using violence to achieve certain goals. What <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/anders-behring-breivik\" title=\"\">Breivik in Norway</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/13/florence-gunman-shoots-street-vendors\" title=\"\">Gianluca Casseri in Florence</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/bombs/0,,190332,00.html\" title=\"\">\"London nailbomber\" David Copeland</a> and Michael Page all share in common is that they arrived at violence following a longer involvement with far-right extremism. For more recent examples \u2013 such as Breivik \u2013 their attacks followed an almost total immersion in online \"virtual communities\". These perform a crucial role in cultivating a set of narratives that are often later used to justify violence. These include emphasis on the perceived threat of racial or cultural extinction, belief in an impending and apocalyptic conflict (a \"race war\" or \"clash of civilisations\"), belief that urgent, radical action is required and that followers have a moral obligation. In short, only by engaging in violence can they defend the wider group from various threats in society.</p> <p>This preference for violence or terrorism reflects a viewpoint within the far right that has long prioritised \"direct action\" over a ballot-box strategy. For much of the past two decades in Europe, the strength of the far right has been measured through its number of votes at elections. But it is important to note that \u2013 for some within this scene \u2013 strength is measured as the ability and willingness to engage in violent action against \"enemies\" that are seen to threaten the racial purity and survival of the native group. These enemies can beimmigrants, minority groups, future leaders of mainstream parties or the state.</p> <p>Identifying and tracking the Breiviks and Pages of this world will always be extremely difficult. But the reality is that \u2013 at least for the past 10 years \u2013 western democracies and their security agencies have focused almost exclusively on only one form of violent extremism. The far right may still pose less of a threat than al-Qaida-inspired groups, say, but our ignorance of this form of extremism is&#xa0;striking.</p> <p>Wisconsin teaches us that the challenge that now presents itself is to understand what \"pushes and pulls\" citizens to commit violence in the name of rightwing extremism, and to develop an effective response. To do this, we must first start taking violence from the far right more seriously.</p>",
  "<p>I have two strangers coming for dinner. This is nerve-racking: who in their right mind invites strangers into their home? Also, I'm worried I've over-seasoned the curry I'm making, but there's no way of checking: I'm fasting so I can't taste as I go.</p> <p>I'm taking part in <a href=\"http://www.ramadanfestival.org/?p=505\" title=\"\">Dine@Mine</a>, an initiative set up by 25-year-old Maryam Douale from Manchester. The idea is that Muslims host an iftar (the meal with which you open your fast) for non-Muslims, to forge better understanding over food. \"Ramadan at my house is loud, fun and full of love and good food,\" Douale says. \"It's my family at its warmest and best. I thought what if we could give non-Muslims a chance to see what a normal Muslim family is like? Food plays such an important role in cultures and traditions ... it brings people together\"</p> <p>My guests, Jack and Jenni, live nearby. I email to say we will break our fast at precisely 8.49pm, while my husband, Richard, wonders helpfully if it'll be \"really awkward\". Meanwhile, I have a meal to prepare. I think of what I grew up with in Ramadan, my mother's big steaming pots of hearty, spicy Pakistani food.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394527310\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/8/1344435550155/Mint-and-cucumber-raita-f-008.jpg\" alt=\"Mint and cucumber raita, for iftar\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Huma's mint and cucumber raita.

I skip the deep-fried pakoras and samosas that feature at most iftars as I find them heavy after a day's fast and for dessert, I'm including a good old British fruit crumble to reflect Richard's background. We'll open our fast the traditional way, with a date and water, a practice that goes back to Islam's beginnings. (And dates give the instant sweet energy rush needed after a day without food.)</p> <p>Jack and Jenni arrive. We offer them elderflower drinks, explaining we will wait until we've opened our fast, but they say they want to wait with us. Although they haven't fasted ahead of the meal, they are excited about joining in: \"When would I ever get the chance to experience any part of Ramadan?\" Jenni asks.</p> <p>At 8.49pm, Richard passes the dates round. Then we help ourselves \u2013 there's no formality with Pakistani food. Our guests' plates are laden with rice and both curries, and, reassuringly, they both want seconds. Jenni asks what we normally eat in Ramadan, and I confess that when I lived alone, I'd gorge on pasta, which left me bloated after a day without eating. Now I cook Pakistani food for special occasions \u2013 after a day's fast, there's nothing like it.</p> <p>I was worried the experience might put us on show \u2013 Look! Here are Muslims who fast! \u2013 but it hasn't at all. Friends and colleagues are intrigued about Ramadan but shy of asking questions and I want our guests to feel they can ask anything. Being used to fasting, I forget this is what baffles people most. \"Do you really get up at 3am? Is it like a midnight feast\" asks Jenni, who thinks sehri, the pre-fast meal, sounds \"magical\". I tell her that eating bagels while half asleep is quite mundane. They've been reading up on Ramadan, and instead of bringing flowers, made a donation to a charity for the homeless.</p> <p>Religion can be one of those subjects you steer clear of at dinner with strangers, but in this context it's easy to be open and honest with our views.</p> <p>The simple act of sharing a meal together has laid down the foundations of a new friendship \u2013 Douale will be pleased to hear we're going over to theirs for dinner after Eid.</p> <h2><strong>Helen Pidd attends iftar in Delhi</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394527311\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/8/1344435769579/Helen-Pidd-celebrating-if-008.jpg\" alt=\"Helen Pidd celebrating iftar with Aisha.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helen Pidd celebrating iftar with Aisha.

But two weeks later I found myself waiting for Ayesha Nusrat, my 23-year-old hostess, self-conscious in a headscarf and salwar kameez outside the Jama Masjid, the enormous 17th-century mosque in Old Delhi.</p> <p>It was a few hours before sundown, so Ayesha took me on a tour inside. Despite covering my blonde hair, I resolutely failed to blend in. Ayesha shooed away the teenage boys photographing me on their phones and told a particularly aggressive hawker that I would not be paying 300 rupees to enter a place of worship.</p> <p>After prayers, the sky started to darken. Hundreds of families spread picnic blankets in the mosque's huge courtyard, an expanse of scorching marble which can accommodate 25,000 prostrate worshippers. But we weren't dining alfresco \u2013 we had a rendezvous with Ayesha's friend Adam Mohammad.</p> <p>Adam's family lives above one of their restaurants, a five minute walk from the mosque's main gate. Dodging cycle rickshaws, stray dogs and cow dung, we trooped past beggars who were crouched outside, waiting for the free meals Muslim restaurateurs dish out to the hungry during Ramadan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394527312\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/8/1344435871892/Goat-biriyani.-008.jpg\" alt=\"Goat biriyani.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goat biriyani: horribly calorific.

Then it was lamb samosas and pakoras stuffed with paneer cheese, juicy mangos and watermelon, washed down with rose water. There was a brief pause while everybody went off to pray on the roof, and then we were off again: goat biryani, crispy fried chicken, pan-fried parantha flatbreads, fluffy milk naans and my favourite, chicken changezi, a tangy mughal curry with a thick tomato and citrus gravy. I was amused that we were given Diet Coke to accompany this obscenely calorific spread, but it hurt to laugh. I'd already had to undo my trousers (\"top tip: elasticated waistbands\" whispered Sandhya, another guest).</p> <p>But it wasn't over yet: next came pheerni, a pot of rice pudding with pistachio shavings; and sheermaal, a sort of waffle dripping in sweet butter. Finally, a cup of milky chai and a bowl of homemade mango ice cream.</p> <p>Can food foster inter-religious understanding? Having finally digested my dinner five days on, I think so.

  "<p>South Korea's first week at London 2012 was marked as much by despair as elation, after two pairs of its badminton players were disqualified for trying to throw a preliminary-round match. A day earlier, one of the country's fencers, Shin A-lam,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/31/london-2012-fencer-a-lam-shin\" title=\"\"> staged a sit-in protest</a>, inconsolable after a timing glitch deprived her of a last-gasp win.</p> <p>But as the Games enter their final stages, South Korea finds itself fourth in the medals table, just one place behind Team GB, and with a fighting chance of beating its record haul of 13 gold medals secured in Beijing four years ago.</p> <p>It looked like South Korean athletes would fall well short of their target of 10 gold medals after the four victories predicted in the first two days failed to materialise.</p> <p>The procession of podium finishes began with 19-year-old Kim Jang-mi, who won gold in the 25-metre pistol event in her first Olympic outing. And despite Shin's controversial exit from the women's epee, she and her fencing compatriots added six more medals, including golds in the men's individual and team sabre.</p> <p>While the world's media focused on North Korea's impressive early start to the Olympics, its rival south of the demilitarised zone that has separated the countries for almost six decades, quietly racked up more successes, in boxing, judo, and shooting.</p> <p>The country also produced one of the early stars of the Games \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/27/im-dong-hyun-london-olympics-record\" title=\"\">Im Dong-hyun</a>, who set set a new world record score of 699 in the archery ranking round at Lord's, despite having eyesight so poor he is registered blind. But perhaps the biggest beneficiary of the Olympics so far is gymnast <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/audioslideshow/2012/aug/07/london-2012-olympic-gymnastics-in-motion\" title=\"\">Yang Hak-seon</a>, who won gold in the men's vault this week.</p> <p>The 19-year-old grew up in grinding poverty, and his family currently live in a converted greenhouse. No sooner had he told reporters in London he would use the cash rewards from his victory to buy a home for his parents, than the president of a South Korean construction firm offered them a property worth \u00a3128,000 free of charge.</p> <p>Many of the 12 gold, five silver and six bronze medals South Korea has won so far came from unexpected sources. The country's media were unable to explain, for example, why its athletes had managed to amass six fencing medals in London, almost the same number as Italy, where the sport has a much longer history.</p> <p>The Chosun Ilbo newspaper noted that South Korea is home to just 1,450 registered fencers, adding that the sport is not taught in primary school. By contrast France, birthplace of the modern guise of the sport, has more than 100,000 fencers.</p> <p>In the end, the secret may have been good, old fashioned graft. \"Korean fencers and staff have slogged their guts out at training for the past four years,\" the newspaper said. \"And their efforts paid off beyond anyone's expectations.\"</p> <p>That was how <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18903429\" title=\"\">Kim Hyeon-woo</a>, who appeared in local newspapers sporting a black eye after winning gold in the 66kg Greco-Roman wrestling, summed up the country's success, albeit more fancifully: \"There is a saying in Korea that my coach uses all the time,\" he told the Korea Times. \"If you work hard, the sky will know.\"</p> <p>South Koreans back home, forced to watch live coverage at odd hours due to the eight-hour time difference with London, expect their athletes to add to the medal haul from Thursday with the start of the taekwondo event. The martial art is the country's national sport, and anything less than two or three gold medals will be judged as a failure.</p> <p>But as Japan's disappointing judoka found out last week, history counts for little in top-flight international competition. To its credit, the Chosun Ilbo has heeded that warning. While predicting at least two gold medals for South Korea, the newspaper cautioned: \"As taekwondo skills have levelled out across the world, Korea is no longer a dominant force.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 August 2012. The original said South Korea had won \"six archery medals in London, the same number as Italy\". This has been corrected to say six fencing medals, almost the same number as Italy.</p>",

They were members of rival gangs who had put aside their differences in a plan, orchestrated via text and BBM messages, to run amok in one of the most extreme episodes of the urban disorder, inner London crown court heard on Wednesday.</p> <p>Three were jailed for nine years, and one was given a seven-year term while others were jailed for six years and six-and-a-half years and three received four-year sentences. Only one rioter was given a non-custodial sentence. All but four had previous convictions, and several had breached detention or curfew orders to take part in the rioting, the court heard.</p> <p>Detective Chief Inspector David Hutcheson said the police were still looking for more than 20 key figures involved in the rioting.</p> <p>The full story of the violence on 8&#xa0;August last year, which Judge Usha Karu said was one of the most extreme nights of the four days of urban disorder, can be told now following the end of two trials.</p> <p>It involved the storming of the Ledbury restaurant in Notting Hill. In previously unseen CCTV footage 30 diners are shown diving under tables as rioters burst in, some carrying batons, and sticks and shouting for diners to get on the floor. Watches, cash, jewellery and phones were taken by rioters wielding poles, knives and baseball bats. One woman had her wedding ring pulled off her finger, and a chauffeur waiting in a Bentley outside was attacked.</p> <p>The court heard that the Ladbroke Blood gang and the Lisson Green Men had put aside rivalries to plan and carry out what the judge said was \"carnage\", \"mayhem\" and \"mob criminality\".</p> <p>One rioter was tackled to the ground by the TV historian Dan Snow.</p> <p>A three-day sentencing hearing heard how the four-hour rampage included an attack on a shopkeeper, Mohammed Haroon, which was not previously detailed in the extensive coverage of the disorder. Haroon was beaten about the head with a looted champagne bottle by 19-year-old Kalen Hinds in an attack caught on CCTV inside the Super Save shop on Westbourne Park Road.</p> <p>In the footage, which can only now be shown, Haroon cowers in the corner of the shop, surrounded by masked youths. Hinds can be seen battering him about the head with the bottle.</p> <p>\"They hit me so many times I was very scared,\" Haroon told Channel 4 News. \"I think they were trying to kill me. After that attack I became dizzy and left the shop. I went out and called the police. The police didn't pick up.\"</p> <p>Jailing Hinds for nine years for conspiracy to burgle, conspiracy to commit violent disorder and the wounding and robbery of Haroon, Karu said the violence was \"completely inexcusable\".</p> <p>Sentencing all 16 \u2013 the youngest of whom is a 15-year-old asylum seeker from Sudan \u2013 Karu said: \"It was a year ago today that you were involved in the mayhem and mob criminality that so disturbed the law abiding public. Today, in stark contrast to those scenes of arson, looting and criminal damage London is hosting the Olympics which demonstrates the excellence that can be achieved in sport as an inspiration to all. However, those involved in these events were involved in the opposite.\"</p> <p>The 16 defendants were among 50 people who rampaged through west London at a time when the police were clearly outnumbered and overwhelmed, the court heard. \"The evidence shows this was not a random meeting but a planned campaign between some of you who knew each other as a result of belonging to gangs and communicated with each other by mobile phone,\" Karu said. \"Two gangs put aside their differences in order to get together to perpetrate the serious disorder. The object was to \u2026 cause chaos, damage and to loot.\"</p> <p>Three of the 16 admitted taking part in the Ledbury raid: Anas Ibrahim, 17, was jailed for six years; Ahmed al-Jaf, 19, was jailed for nine years for the Ledbury raid and his part in the attack on Haroon; the 15-year-old Sudanese asylum seeker, who cannot be named, was sentenced to three years in detention.</p> <p>Hutcheson said afterwards: \"These are some of the most significant sentences that have been given for the rioting. These events involved members of several gangs who organised themselves via social media to cause mayhem. Hopefully these sentences will send a strong message to those involved in gangs or those contemplating involvement.\"</p> <h2>Full list of defendants and their sentences</h2> <p><strong>Kalem Hinds</strong>, 19, was sentenced to nine years in a young offenders' institution for conspiracy to burgle, conspiracy to commit violent disorder, wounding and robbery of Mohammed Haroon</p> <p><strong>Rio Myers</strong>, 16, received four years for conspiracy to burgle, conspiracy to commit violent disorder, robbery of Haroon and robbery of a taxi driver</p> <p><strong>Gyasi Skinner</strong>, 20, received nine years two months for conspiracy to burgle and conspiracy to commit violent disorder, other rioting matters and four burglaries</p> <p><strong>Karim Lamguindaz</strong>, 16, for conspiracy to burgle and conspiracy to commit violent disorder, received a three-year rehabilitation order and a tagged curfew</p> <p><strong>Liam Hodge</strong>, 21, was sentenced to four years four months for conspiracy to handle stolen goods and other matters including possession of cannabis and fraud</p> <p><strong>Tyler Brewer</strong>, 19, was jailed for four years and one month for or conspiracy to handle stolen goods and a separate burglary</p> <p><strong>Jazz Dedier</strong>, 18, received 18 months in a young offenders' institution for conspiracy to commit violent disorder.

  "<p>Iran is stepping up efforts to secure the release of 48 pilgrims held in Damascus and accused of being Revolutionary Guards helping Bashar al-Assad's regime to crush the uprising.</p> <p>Tehran admitted on Wednesday that some of the group were \"retired members\" of the elite force but demanded they be released unharmed. It has asked the UN to help and warned the US that it will be held responsible for their fate.</p> <p>In a diplomatic drive across the Middle East, Iran has urged Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which all openly back the anti-Assad rebels, to use their influence to secure the release of the pilgrims, who were abducted on Saturday. Three of them were said to have been killed in government shelling in Damascus on Monday.</p> <p>\"Some of these (Iranians) were retired Revolutionary Guards and military members ... and others were from different departments,\" said Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, after flying to Ankara to seek Turkish help. But he denied they had military connections and insisted they were in Damascus for a Shia pilgrimage. Ahmet Davutoglu, his Turkish counterpart, pledged to help but there was anger over criticism from Tehran that Ankara was assisting US \"warmongering.\"</p> <p>In another aspect of the intensifying propaganda war around the Syrian crisis, Russia flatly denied a claim that anti-Assad rebels had assassinated a Russian general advising the Syrian military. A video statement from a group calling itself the Hawks Special Operations Battalion named the general as Vladimir Petrovich Kochyev and showed a copy of an ID document issued by the Syrian military. The same group claimed responsibility for the sensational assassination of four of Assad's most senior security chiefs in Damascus last month.</p> <p>The Itar-Tass news agency in Russia said a reserve officer called Vladimir Kuzheyev had met journalists at the defence ministry in Moscow to deny that he had been killed. Kuzheyev did not say whether he had served in Syria but declared: \"I want to confirm that I am alive and well.\" The difference betwen the two names could be explained by faulty transliteration from Russian into Arabic.</p> <p>Russia, a firm supporter of Assad, is estimated to have several hundred military personnel in Syria, including some manning highly sensitive installations \u2013 the Mediterranean port of Tartous is an important Russian naval base. Moscow has also used its security council veto three times to block any punitive UN action.</p> <p>The Free Syrian Army, the main armed opposition group, confirmed that Syria's defecting prime minister Riyad Hijab arrived in Jordan on Wednesday, two days after hiding in a \"safe location\" near the border inside Syria. Hijab's defection \u2014 the most senior yet of a Syrian political figure \u2014 was announced on Monday, but amid confusion about his whereabouts, it transpired that he had been waiting to cross safely.</p> <p>King Abdullah of Jordan meanwhile, suggested that Assad could seek to establish an enclave for his Alawite sect if he cannot retain control of the whole of the country as the crisis deepens. Any such move could prompt decades of further problems for the region, Abdullah told the US broadcaster CBS. \"I have a feeling that if he [Assad] can't rule greater Syria then maybe an Alawi enclave is plan B,\" he said. \"That would be, I think for us, the worst case scenario because that means then the break-up of greater Syria, and that means that everybody starts landgrabbing, which makes no sense to me. If Syria then implodes on itself that would create problems that would take us decades to come back from.\"</p>",

  "<p>A Labour candidate to become an elected police and crime commissioner has been forced to step down from the contest in November because, 46 years ago, he was fined \u00a35 for two minor offences.</p> <p>Bob Ashford, who has Whitehall security clearance and has been director of strategy for the Youth Justice Board for the past 10 years, has been told by the Home Office and Electoral Commission that his conviction, at the age of 13 in 1966, is enough to bar him from standing for the post of commissioner.</p> <p>The strict interpretation of the rules has already led the Falklands veteran Simon Weston OBE to pull out of the contest because he said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/02/simon-weston-police-crime-commissioner\" title=\"\">it was becoming \"too political\"</a>. He feared that his \u00a330 fine at the age of 14 for being a passenger in a stolen car would have put him out of the race.</p> <p>Labour is urgently canvassing its other 40 candidates in England and Wales to check that none have an undisclosed juvenile conviction. In the current state of election law, Ashford could become prime minister but is barred from standing as a police commissioner.</p> <p>Ashford's resignation is the latest embarrassment for the home secretary, Theresa May, in her attempt to prevent her flagship policy being turned into farce by low turnouts and poor quality candidates. But it is also embarrassing for Labour because there was cross-party agreement on the extremely tight rules on the treatment of juvenile convictions when the legislation was drawn up.</p> <p>It is thought that after the Weston case, when the home secretary publicly declared that the rules were not meant to apply to his case, Home Office and Election Commission officials were asked to look again at the regulations.</p> <p>They came back and said the way the law was drafted meant there was no room for manoeuvre.</p> <p>Ashford apologised to supporters and <a href=\"http://bobashford.co.uk/\" title=\"\">spelled out </a>the details of his offence, saying he wanted to highlight \"the continuing damage of offences and criminal records committed by children and young people being carried into their adult lives\".</p> <p>He said that in 1966 he was living in Bristol when a group of lads from school knocked on his door and demanded he went with them. They went to a railway embankment. It was, he says, something he felt very uncomfortable about.</p> <p>\"One of the lads pulled out an air gun and started shooting at cans. I never touched the air gun and felt unable to leave, as I was frightened at what might happen at school. A goods train passed and presumably the guard reported our presence to the police who arrived a short time later. The lads with the air gun ran away while I and two others froze and were arrested,\" said Ashford.</p> <p>\"My next memory is of the police coming to my house and talking to my parents in a separate room. The police never questioned me to my knowledge.</p> <p>\"I then went to court and was to the best of my knowledge charged with trespass on the railway and possession of an offensive weapon. I was told to plead guilty even though I had never touched the air gun. I was fined \u00a32 and 10 shillings on both counts.\"</p> <p>The 2011 police commissioner legislation specifically says all juvenile offences should be treated as though the offender were 18 and both offences can lead to the person being sent to prison if they were an adult. It overrides any provision in the 1974 Rehabilitation of Offenders Act.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \"The Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 disqualifies a person from standing for election as a PCC if they have at any time been convicted of an offence for which a person could be sent to prison; whether or not they themselves were sent to prison for that offence.\"</p> <p>\"This high standard was set by cross-party agreement because PCCs will hold police forces, whose duty is to uphold the law to account.\"</p> <p>A senior Labour source said: \"It is an absolute shame for him but also highlights the latest poor aspect to a very poor policy.\"</p> <p>But the Bristol Labour MP, Kerry McCarthy, was less reticent: \"That seems totally unjust to me, Bob,\" she tweeted. \"You were a great candidate and would have been an excellent PCC. Rules should be changed!\"</p>",

On Friday, reciprocating vulnerabilities in the two companies' security practices allowed hackers moving between Amazon and Apple to pull off an attack heard around the world \u2013 the technology world, at least.</p> <p>The hack exploded in the news because on Monday the target of the attack, Mat Honan, published a detailed, damning <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all/\">3,500-word piece about it on the technology site Wired.com</a>, where he works as a senior writer.</p> <p>\"Those security lapses are my fault, and I deeply, deeply regret them,\" Honan wrote. \"But what happened to me exposes vital security flaws in several customer service systems, most notably Apple's and Amazon's.\"</p> <p>Neither <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/amazon-changes-policy-wont-add-new-credit-cards-to-accounts-over-the-phone/\">Apple</a> nor <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-icloud-password-freeze/\">Amazon</a> is commenting on the security changes, which were first reported in Wired.</p> <p>The attack erased Honan's digital existence and wiped clean the contents of his iPad, iPod and MacBook hard drive, including all his pictures of his one-year-old daughter. It obliterated eight years of Gmail messages. It culminated in the hijacking of his Twitter account, which was the hackers' goal in the first place \u2013 a coveted prize, according to a hacker whom Honan succeeded in contacting, due to its <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mat\">stylish three-letter handle, @mat</a>. (Honan has since regained control of his Twitter account, and reports headway in Apple's attempt to recover his hard drive data, including the pictures.)</p> <p>How did it happen? The short answer is that Honan made it easy for the hackers to guess the .Me email address associated with his AppleID by using the same email prefix for multiple accounts. His use of iCloud \u2013 which Apple aggressively promotes \u2013 meant hackers could remotely wipe all his Apple devices.</p> <p>Honan's telling is a recommended read, not least for his description of the instant-message exchange he had with one of the hackers. In an act of journalistic aplomb, Honan <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all/\">pursues the hacker as a source to</a> explain exactly why the hack was carried out and how it worked.</p> <p>But the attack could not have happened without seemingly lax and interlocking security rules at Apple and Amazon. Once the hackers had Honan's Apple email, they needed only two other pieces of information to gain full access to his Apple kingdom: a billing address and the last four digits of a credit card number.</p> <p>The billing address was obtained through a quick search for Honan's personal web domain on <a href=\"mailto:http://www.whois.com/\">whois.com</a>.</p> <p>The credit card is where Amazon came in. Before the recent change in policy, all the hackers needed to crack Honan's Amazon identity \u2013 and view the last four digits of his credit card number \u2013 was a name, an email address and a billing address. They had all three.</p> <p>They got the digits. Then they called back Apple.</p> <p>\"At 5:02 p.m., they reset my Twitter password,\" <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all/\">Honan writes</a>. \"At 5:00 they used iCloud's 'Find My' tool to remotely wipe my iPhone. At 5:01 they remotely wiped my iPad. At 5:05 they remotely wiped my MacBook. Around this same time, they deleted my Google account. At 5:10, I placed the call to AppleCare. At 5:12 the attackers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mat/status/231543036159602688\">posted a message </a>to my account on Twitter taking credit for the hack.\"</p> <p>To learn how to protect against a hack like the one that hit Honan, <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/08/how-not-to-become-mat-honan/\">click here</a>. Two quick steps: make sure you use different passwords for different accounts and if you use Gmail, set up <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/advanced-sign-in-security-for-your.html\">two-step verification </a>for access to your account.</p> <p>The new security rules at Amazon and Apple seem to have plugged the leak used by Honan's hackers. An <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/amazon-changes-policy-wont-add-new-credit-cards-to-accounts-over-the-phone/\">attempt by Wired on Tuesday</a> to replicate the hack failed, after similar attempts Monday had succeeded. </p> <p>Do the security patches at Amazon and Apple go far enough? Unfortunately the hackers are likely to know before the rest of us do.</p>",
  "<p>In the historic sense, Ireland's long love affair with the Catholic church was, as Ella Fitzgerald once sang, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpPLnF7FEzU\" title=\"\">\"too hot not to cool down\"</a>. Catholicism was once so all-pervading in Irish life that it seemed a definition of Irishness: but now, according to a survey by the pollsters Red C, the Irish are losing their faith quicker than most: seven years ago, 69% of Irish people described themselves as \"religious\": this has now <a href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/republic-of-ireland/republic-of-ireland-abandoning-religion-faster-than-almost-every-other-country-16195112.html\" title=\"\">fallen more than 20 points to 47%</a>.</p> <p>Something had to give, and even before the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/03/diarmuid-martin-irish-catholicism-vatican\" title=\"\">clerical scandals</a> broke into the public realm \u2013 in the 1990s \u2013 this intermingling of faith and fatherland was in decline. There was the effect of the 1960s. There was the effect of the pill, which, contrary to legend, was legal in Ireland. There was television. There was modernisation, which the Vatican advanced as <a href=\"http://vatican2voice.org/3butlerwrites/aggiorna.htm\" title=\"\"><em>aggiornamento</em></a>. Around the time of Vatican II \u2013 1962-65 \u2013 it could be said that in the hills of Connemara they spoke of little else.</p> <p>But there were a lot of concerned parents, too, writing to the devotional magazines saying that they were in despair because they just couldn't get their offspring to pray: the family rosary was gone: their son (it was usually their son) wouldn't go to mass, no matter how much they beseeched. Gradually, you could see traditional Irish Catholicism unravelling. The votive lights placed under the <a href=\"http://www.ourcatholicfaith.org/gallery/picsacredheart.html\" title=\"\">picture of the Sacred Heart</a> were disappearing in country B&amp;Bs. My aunt, who had once felt miserably guilty for absent-mindedly taking a cup of Bovril on a meatless Friday, could relax.</p> <p>Then there were heated national arguments about divorce \u2013 arguments as often about land as matrimony \u2013 and it took <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9511/ireland_vote/index.html\" title=\"\">three referendums to introduce a divorce law</a>. There were even more heated debates about abortion, and though faith is still a strong part of Irish values in this, there is a cultural element too: agricultural societies regarded infertility as failure, and \"abortion\" traditionally meant a cow had failed to calf.</p> <p>And then in the 1990s and the 2000s the clerical scandals erupted, in which ghastly episodes of priests molesting and sometimes raping children and young people were brought to light. Richard Dawkins visited Dublin \u2013 and Listowel, in Co Kerry, for Writers' Week \u2013 and scolded the Irish for having God in their constitution; they took it on the chin, and bought his book The God Delusion at the double.</p> <p>Among Dublin's smart set it seemed the kiss of social death to admit to being a practising Catholic: it's even vaguely unfashionable to be married, especially only once. Nonetheless, in the 2011 census, it emerged that 84% of the people of the Irish Republic described themselves as \"Roman Catholic\". The number of atheists and agnostics and diverse other faiths was up too, but Roman Catholics remained the majority.</p> <p>However, it is evident, especially in Dublin, that nominal inscription to a religion is one thing, while actual practice is another. Red C's survey only confirms what is obvious anecdotally: that a substantial number of Irish people have ditched the religion of their ancestors because they think it no longer applies in an age of scientific rationality; because they rebuff \"control\" by ecclesiastics; because they are disgusted by the clerical scandals \u2013 indeed, Archbishop Diarmuid Martin of Dublin is himself disgusted by what he has had to read in the archives; or because sex, drugs and accumulating electronic gadgets are more \"relevant\" to modern life than \"God and Mary, His Mother\", as the traditional greeting in the Irish language puts it.</p> <p>And yes, the forename of \"Mary\", once so common that half the class at my convent school bore it, is now a highly unusual moniker among younger generations.</p> <p>Yet I would distinguish between \"religion\" and \"faith\" in the Irish context. If the traditional structures of \"religion\" are weaker, there remains a strong deposit of \"faith\" among the people. Country pilgrimages still thrive. When there is a local tragedy \u2013 fishermen drowned at sea, teenagers killed in a bad road collision \u2013 the parish priest still speaks for the people, and organises the rites of passage. And solace.</p> <p>I was in a church in a small Co Leitrim <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townlands\" title=\"\">townland</a> of 900 people not long ago when the priest thanked parishioners for helping out flood victims in Pakistan \u2013 they had put over \u20ac3,000 on the plate for the poor in Pakistan. If the structures of religion are weaker, some of the kind impulses of faith are still there.</p> <p><em> </em></p>",
  "<p>The Egyptian military launched operations from the air and ground against suspected Islamic militants in the Sinai on Wednesday, in a move that could herald a sustained campaign to regain control of the anarchic region.</p> <p>In a further sign of a tougher approach the Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, sacked his intelligence chief, Mourad Mowafi. According to Egyptian TV, the intelligence services had advance warning of Sunday's attack but failed to act in the belief that Muslims would not attack fellow Muslims during the meal to break the Ramadan fast. The governor of north Sinai and the head of the military police were also removed from their posts.</p> <p>Air strikes on targets near the town of Sheikh Zuwaid, close to the border with Gaza, left at least 20 militants dead. Egyptian troops raided villages in the area following attacks overnight by gunmen on checkpoints around the north Sinai city of el-Arish, in which five security personnel and one civilian were wounded.</p> <p>Security forces shut the main highway close to the city as the air strikes began; and power, internet and mobile phone networks in the area were shut down.</p> <p>It was the Egyptian military's first use of air power in the Sinai since its 1973 war with Israel. The Sinai was declared a demilitarised zone under the 1979 peace treaty between the two countries, and military presence in the region is strictly constrained.</p> <p>In a statement read out on state TV, the military said the aim was to \"restore stability and regain control\" of the Sinai. It followed an attack on Sunday, in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/05/attack-across-egypt-israel-border\" title=\"\">Islamic militants killed 16 Egyptian border guards</a> before breaching the border and penetrating more than 1km inside Israel. An armoured vehicle commandeered by the militants was blown up in an Israeli missile strike close to several kibbutzim and other agricultural communities. Scorch marks, burnt rubber and bullet casings still littered the site of the explosion and subsequent gun battle on Wednesday.</p> <p>Egypt's response was welcomed by Israel, which has exerted intense pressure on its neighbour to crack down on militant activity in the Sinai. The area has become increasingly chaotic and violent in the 18 months since the Egyptian revolution. \"What we see in Egypt is a strong fury, a determination of the regime and the army to take care of it and impose order in Sinai because that is their responsibility,\" a senior Israeli defence official, Amos Gilad, told Israel Radio.</p> <p>However, it was not immediately clear whether the Egyptian operation was the start of a long campaign to root out militants and smugglers from the Sinai or a one-off response aimed at calming popular anger over the deaths of 16 soldiers while breaking the Ramadan fast at sunset.</p> <p>\"Once the regime in Cairo decides to clean up Sinai, it could take one month, two, three, five, a year\u201a but it will happen. It's not mission impossible,\" said Major-General Yom-tov Samia, a former head of the Israeli military's southern command. \"With the right will and the right plan they can do it. But am I sure this is the first step of many? No, I'm not sure. It was a reaction. I hope it's part of a plan.\"</p> <p>Egypt also closed the Rafah border until further notice, leaving Gaza largely cut off from the outside world. It also began sealing the tunnels underneath the border between Egypt and Gaza, which have been used for the past five years to smuggle people, consumer goods, construction materials and weapons. Egypt has claimed Palestinian militants from Gaza were involved in Sunday's attack.</p> <p>Gaza's ruling party, Hamas, which swiftly condemned the cross-border attack, also moved to shut down the Gaza end of the tunnels, prompting long queues at petrol stations. The vast majority of fuel used by Gazans for cars and generators is smuggled and costs around half the price of fuel imported legally from Israel.</p> <p>Hamas is anxious to distance itself from the attack and also to co-operate with the Egyptian government, although it described the closure of the Rafah crossing as \"collective punishment\". Hamas, which has close ties to the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, had high expectations of Morsi's stated intention take steps to ease Gaza's isolation.</p> <p>At the Kerem Shalom kibbutz, tucked into a corner of southern Israel where the Gaza and Egyptian borders intersect, Andy Breakell said the community was accustomed to mortars and rockets being fired from Gaza, \"but [Sunday's attack] was an escalation, a different ball game\". Residents of the kibbutz were ordered to take shelter in protective rooms during the attack, from which the Manchester-born Breakell, 58, watched 100m sprinter Usain Bolt win a gold medal at the London Olympics.</p>",

  "<p>That Peter Marks, the retiring chief executive of the Co-operative Group, can reflect proudly on the fact that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/07/co-operative-group-peter-marks-retires\" title=\"\">\"mutualism is back in vogue\"</a> is a startling turnaround for the sector since Marks began work as a Co-op supermarket shelf-stacker in 1967. Back then, a national daily described the average Co-operative shop window as reminiscent of a shop in a suburb of Kharkov. As a contemporary observed: \"To many a working-class mother it is St Michael who is the patron saint of the consumer.\"</p> <p>That has changed. The UK's \u00a335.6bn co-operative \"member-owned\" economy \u2013 businesses owned either (like the Co-op) by consumer-members or (like John Lewis) by employee-members \u2013 has outperformed the UK economy for the fourth consecutive year, growing 1.5% in 2011, double the rate for the UK economy overall. While the real level of GDP in the UK in 2011 was 1.7% lower than in 2008, co-operative sector turnover has grown 19.5% over that period.</p> <p>Some parts of the co-operative economy have been resilient for the past 40 years \u2013 but without public recognition. Nationwide building society is a case in point. In 1965 the Co-operative Permanent building society, the third-largest society in the country, was successfully expanding. By the late 80s \u2013 now called Nationwide Anglia \u2013 it had become the world's largest mutual building society, having refused to follow the example of many of its rivals and become a bank. But it had dropped the word \"Co-operative\" from its name in 1970, and was no longer associated in the public mind with the co-operative movement.</p> <p>The particular decline of the Co-op outlets in London also affected the perception of mutual enterprise in Whitehall \u2013 as the London shops closed, fewer Whitehall civil servants realised its enduring strength outside the capital. For Sir Humphrey, Peter Jones's Sloane Square emporium seemed a lonely standard bearer for mutualism, and that made the implementation of measures to stimulate the co-operative sector appear less mainstream. Indeed, until specific efforts by <a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2010/06/the-mutual-tradtion-tessa-jowells-full-speech/\" title=\"\">Tessa Jowell to persuade Whitehall otherwise</a>, the civil service was unwilling to distinguish between co-operatives and mutuals on the one hand, and charities and voluntary organisations on the other, consigning all to a basket of what it inelegantly described as the third sector.</p> <p>The reasons for the co-operative renaissance are twofold. First, the mighty Co-operative Group, led by Peter Marks, rediscovered its mojo and, having been on the back foot to Tesco and Sainsbury's for nearly three decades, realised its inherent potential. (After all was not the successful supermarket reward card but a pale pastiche of the traditional co-op divvy?) With the successful takeover of Somerfield in 2009, the Co-op took on one of its larger private sector challengers and won. Co-operative retail has doubled its market share over the last decade to nearly 10%.</p> <p>Second, structural barriers holding back the growth of mutuals were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jan/31/gordon-brown-labour-election-manifesto\" title=\"\">lifted by the Blair-Brown governments</a>. New legislation meant that employers transferring shares to employees would no longer have to wait six years to receive tax relief, and it also helped protect building societies against pressures to demutualise.</p> <p>Cameron's government has been less supportive of co-ops and mutual than its <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7083878.stm\" title=\"\">rhetoric implies</a>, having moved swiftly during 2010 to axe the Blair-Brown legacy of fiscal support. Thus the government's early support packages for creating community owned pubs and shops, and co-operative schools were <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7931825/Government-axes-fund-to-help-communities-buy-ailing-pubs.html\" title=\"\">early victims</a> of Osborne's austerity axe. And barriers remain. Business education and legal training often ignore co-operative models. Bank funding remains lacking, especially for newer co-operatives and, as the thinktank <a href=\"http://www.policy-network.net/pno_detail.aspx?ID=4193&amp;title=Investing+in+the+mutualisation+of+public+services\" title=\"\">Policy Network recently observed</a>: \"Traditional investors can find it difficult to fund organisations with community asset locks or with restrictions on the transfer of ownership rights or the payment of dividends. In seeking only a financial return, traditional investors treat as a downside \u2026 the very factors which make the mutual model so attractive.\" If Cameron is going to join the new vogue, he has work to do.</p>",

A decade earlier, Trevor quickly progressed to become the head of the School's Sixth form College in 1988. He moved to Islington Green School in 2002, the school Tony Blair refused to send his children to despite his public commitment to comprehensive education. It controversially failed its Ofsted inspection in 1997. Nine months after Trevor joined the school it passed its inspection and the registered inspector described him as \"visionary and transformational\". In 2004 Tony Blair's former speech writer Peter Hyman joined the school and wrote his book <em>One out of ten</em>, comparing Trevor's leadership style favourably with Blair. Peter and Trevor worked together to start the process of Islington Green becoming an Academy in 2008. In 2007 Trevor was appointed executive head of Salisbury School in North London, to effect his brand of transformation on the second poorest school in London. Five terms after joining the school, he and his team had reduced 200 exclusions to zero, doubled the key exam indicator and set the groundwork to successfully pass its OFSTED inspection. That year Trevor was named as one of the top 100 up and coming most influential people in London in the Evening Standard's Poll and became a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.

She presented parents an alternative to the dominant \"feel good\" curriculum and \"anything goes\". With up to half of the teaching in English, performed by native English speakers, and a structured environment in which teachers can teach and students learn, \"tough love\", the school was an immediate success among parents. It has become the leading free school in the compulsory school system in Sweden, with 19 schools and over 13000 students. Ms. Bergstrom was awarded \"Entrepreneur of the year\" in Sweden in 2009. She remains as chairman of the board of Internationella Engelska Skolan. In 2012, IES is starting its first free school in the UK in Brandon, Suffolk. If Britain wishes to see a major sector of free schools, and a real choice for parents of all backgrounds, then allowing school companies and free individual choice of school is the only way forward. Naturally, it has to be combined with the right public institutions for accreditation and inspection. </p> <h2>Wendy Berliner</h2> <p>Head of education, professional networks, <strong>Guardian News and Media</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-400478275\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/pictures/2011/10/13/Wendy-Berliner140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Innovation in Education 2011: Wendy Berliner\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Wendy Berliner is an award winning education journalist who has spent half her career at The Guardian, first as education correspondent, then as a news editor and later as an education feature writer.

Adelphi became a small but important independent production and distribution company.</p> <p>But then came a difficult era for small independent companies; Adelphi from the 1960s became dormant, though remaining in the control of the Dent family. But both Stanley and David continued to believe that the Adelphi product had value, even when the films were out of fashion.</p> <p>My sister, Jean, and I took over Adelphi in 2007. The British Film Institute is remastering the films, and the originals are now part of the National Film Archive. Stanley and David had great pleasure in this late success and regularly attended screenings at the BFI Southbank.</p> <p>From the 1960s, Stanley ran several businesses; did maths and accountancy tuition; and in the late 70s took a degree in computer studies at Birkbeck College, London, where he was active in the students' union. He became a programmer in Cobol and Fortran and used a PC all his life. His passion was politics. He was active in CND, the Labour party, the Marx Memorial Library, the Association of Jewish Ex-Servicemen and Women, the British Legion and the Gatehouse Theatre Club. He was extremely well-read, loved poetry and took part in play readings. Although not religious, he kept Yom Kippur and Passover.</p> <p>Stanley remained vigorous into his 90s. He had a stroke in 2006 and lost his speech, but partially recovered through determination and therapy. After a second devastating stroke this year, he was cared for in Nightingale \u2013 a Jewish home where Arthur had been life governor.</p> <p>Stanley is survived by his wife, Margaret, whom he married in 1942, by me and Jean, and by three grandchildren.</p>",
  "<p>A white supremacist who killed six people at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head after he was shot by a police officer, the FBI said on Wednesday.</p> <p>Authorities originally said Wade Michael Page was killed by police, but federal officials now say he took his own life after being injured during an exchange of gunfire with officers.</p> <p>At a news briefing in Milwaukee, FBI special agent Teresa Carlson said investigators have not yet settled on a motive for the attack at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in Oak Creek on Sunday. </p> <p>Page, an army veteran whose record was marred by drunkenness and a failure to report for duty, walked into the temple just before 10.30am and opened fire with a 9mm pistol. Among those killed were the president of the temple, Satwant Singh Kaleka, who was shot as he tried to hold back Page with a butter knife.</p> <p>On Tuesday night, Oak Creek residents turned out in their hundreds for a vigil for the victims. Addressing the crowd, the town's police chief, John Edwards, said he was struck by the lack of hatred in the reaction of the Sikh community.</p> <p>Standing in front a row of people holding signs that spelled \"practice peace\", Edwards said: \"In 28 years of law enforcement, I have seen a lot of hate. I have seen a lot of revenge. I've seen a lot of anger. What I saw, particularly from the Sikh community this week was compassion, concern, support.</p> <p>\"What I didn't see was hate. I did not see revenge. I didn't see any of that. And in law enforcement that's unusual to not see that reaction to something like this. I want you all to understand how unique that is.\"</p> <p>At the FBI briefing on Wednesday, Carlson said Page had not come to the attention of federal officials before Sunday's incident. She said investigators were interviewing dozens of people who knew Page, in their attempts to determine a motive for the attack, which the FBI has classed as an act of domestic terrorism. </p> <p>Page had a record of minor alcohol-related crimes in Texas, Colorado and North Carolina. He was demoted during a stint in the army for getting drunk on duty and going absent without leave before he was discharged in 1998. </p> <p>After the army, Page drifted between jobs and played in white power bands. Sometimes he performed with a Nazi swastika hanging behind the drummer. His first band, Definite Hate, produced an album called Violent Victory with a cover design of a white fist punching a black man in the face.</p> <p>The fist is tattooed with the letters HFFH for \"Hammerskins Forever, Forever Hammerskins\" after a national skinhead organisation.</p> <p>Page stopped showing up for work in July. He visited a gun shop and, after clearing background checks, bought the gun he used in the shooting.</p> <p>His girlfriend, 31-year-old nursing student Misty Cook, was arrested on a provisional charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm, South Milwaukee police said Tuesday. The FBI said Wednesday her arrest was not linked to Sunday's shooting.</p>",
  "<p>Despite the heartening news that a Kingston jury <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/08/boris-johnson-aide-extreme-pornography-cleared\" title=\"\">returned not guilty verdicts</a> in a landmark porn trial on Wednesday, grave questions arise about the right of the state to intrude on the privacy of the individual with unfounded obscenity prosecutions.</p> <p>My client, Simon Walsh, was charged with five counts of possessing \"extreme pornography\" under <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/4/section/63\" title=\"\">section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 (CJIA)</a>. The images showed acts of fisting and urethral sounding (the insertion of surgical rods into the urethra for the purpose of sexual gratification).</p> <p>These acts are legal to perform (fisting is even discussed in Fifty Shades of Grey - now the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/07/erotic-book-fifty-shades-british-bestseller\" title=\"\">bestselling book in British history</a>), but representing them is criminalised under the CJIA if they are \"likely to result, in serious injury to a person's anus, breasts or genitals\". While prosecutions under s63 are not uncommon (1,337 offences were prosecuted last year), most accused plead guilty. It is therefore rare for a jury to consider this specific situation: whether someone is guilty of a crime that could result in imprisonment due to possessing images of legal acts.</p> <p>Simon is openly gay and enjoyed these acts in private with other consenting adults, so what has any of this got to do with the general public? Like Simon, you could be sent a potentially illegal picture via email. One which you never requested or opened, only to later find yourself in court, accused of being in possession of it.</p> <p>While some defendants have hundreds of thousands of allegedly extreme or indecent images on their computers, Simon had five images of consensual adult sexual activity and a single unrequested picture unopened on his email server attached to an email containing a story about \"Jason\". Simon never requested this image and the prosecution were unable to prove Simon ever opened, viewed or knew it. In the story Jason was described as being in his mid twenties. The prosecution described Jason as being 14 years old; the legal age of representation in pornography being 18.</p> <p>Three defence experts viewed the image and stated in written reports that Jason was in his twenties. As a matter of legal procedure, the jury never heard this expert evidence. Instead they used their common sense and acquitted Simon.</p> <p>Nonetheless this procedure raises significant concerns about the way in which prosecutions are conducted and the right of the state to interfere with the privacy of the individual.</p> <p>Unlike the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/7-8/66/contents\" title=\"\">Obscene Publication Act</a>, which covers distribution, the CJIA shifts the burden on to individuals in possession of pornography. People need to know how to modify their behaviour in accordance with the law, yet it is unclear what acts constitute \"extreme pornography\".</p> <p>As well as criminalising acts which are legal to perform, the CJIA would seemingly outlaw images which have been exhibited in art galleries. In 2008, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/oct/16/art\" title=\"\">Barbican Gallery's Seduced exhibition</a> included photographic images of male on male anal fisting and male urethral insertion from artist Robert Mapplethorpe's X Portfolio. The gallery cleared them with the City of London police before the exhibition opened.</p> <p>Police also regularly misclassify images they discover. In the <a href=\"http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/New-laws-test-landmark-trial/story-12570771-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">Stafford extreme pornography trial</a>, my client was initially charged with being in possession of over 1,250 \"extreme\" images. Upon viewing them, it became clear that over 900 were of clothed performers not engaging in any form of sexual activity. That defendant was eventually acquitted by a jury of all charges.</p> <p>So, would you even know what material might be illegal? Have you been sent junk emails and not opened them? How much do you know about operating systems caching images attached to unopened emails?</p> <p>Simon is a barrister specialising in actions against the police, an alderman of the City of London, a magistrate and was formerly an aide to the Mayor of London. As a consequence of this prosecution, Simon was fired by Boris Johnson and excluded from his chambers. He ran the risk of going to prison. He had to listen to his innermost sexual fantasies discussed in court and media. This included an inaccurate accusation in the Mail Online that he had actually viewed \"child porn\".</p> <p>In questioning defence expert witness Dr Clarissa Smith, prosecution counsel Thomas Wilkins asked if those who attended sexual health clinics were significantly more likely to have engaged in \"risky\" sexual behaviours. She disagreed.</p> <p>He then stated that if the fisting pictures were of women they must be degrading and objectifying. She disagreed. In his closing address to the jury, he described Dr Smith's evidence as: \"disingenuous, self-serving and dishonest\".</p> <p>In addressing the jury, defence counsel Matthew Buckland stated that: \"The modern zeitgeist is an inclusive one. To call this obscene is a huge retrograde step\". Nevertheless in his summing up for the jury, His Honour Judge Price QC stated that: \"It is emphatically not your duty to send out a message to anyone about modern society\".</p> <p>Thankfully, the result of the jury's verdict is precisely that. They have made a powerful statement about the voyeur state intruding on the liberty of individuals' private and consensual sex lives. As the American comedian Bill Hicks said in satirising the US supreme court's attitude:</p> <blockquote> \"The problem with pornography is basically this: no one knows what it is. Other than that we got a really good grasp on the situation. We know it's bad; we just can't figure out what the fuck it is.\" </blockquote>",
  "<p>The bid to take American electricals retailer Best Buy private could trigger the end of its joint venture with Carphone Warehouse and net a \u00a3660m profit for Charles Dunstone's business.</p> <p>Dunstone sold 50% of Carphone Warehouse Europe, which owns his stores in the UK and on the continent, to Best Buy for \u00a31.1bn in 2008. The two also have a profit-sharing agreement to create a chain of mobile phone stores in China and Mexico.</p> <p>But if Best Buy's former chairman Richard Schulze succeeds in a bid unveiled this week to buy out the company he founded, a clause in its deal with Carphone Warehouse would allow Dunstone to buy back the half of his business.</p> <p>Under the terms of the deal with Best Buy, Dunstone has an option to buy the 50% stake back at \"fair market value\" if there is a change of ownership at Best Buy. Exane BNP Paribas bank puts that number at \u00a3600m, which at today's exchange rates is \u00a3500m less than Best Buy originally paid.</p> <p>With a guaranteed 10% discount, regaining full control could cost Dunstone just \u00a3540m.</p> <p>The break clause also gives him the option to sell his share of the two companies' Global Connect venture. Exane estimates Best Buy would pay as much as \u00a3100m for the mobile phone shop business.</p> <p>\"In our view it is highly likely under this scenario that Carphone would want to take up these options,\" said Exane analyst Ben Spruntulis. He added that Dunstone and his chief executive, Roger Taylor, already had a \"strong track record of undertaking value-enhancing transactions with Best Buy\".</p> <p>A spokesman for Carphone said: \"We do not comment on rumour and speculation. Our commitment to our relationship remains as strong as ever.\" Best Buy may welcome the cash generated by exiting its European venture. The retailer is struggling to compete with online rivals like Amazon, prompting Schulze's bid to organise a private equity buyout.</p> <p>The founder and former chairman has written to the company saying that he is in talks with top-flight private equity firms and that his financial adviser, Credit Suisse, is \"highly confident\" it could arrange the necessary debt financing.</p> <p>The contract with Carphone contains break clauses from 2015 onwards. These clauses can be brought forward should either partner be taken over by a company that is not majority controlled by the founders, Schulze and Dunstone.</p> <p>If Schulze succeeds in his bid to acquire Best Buy, he is unlikely to retain majority control. He has offered to put just $1bn of equity into the deal, with the rest raised from private equity firms and the debt markets. This would give him around 25% of the new company \u2013 not enough to claim control.</p> <p>Carphone may also want to end the relationship because it has been looking to form a partnership with other retailers, namely Media Markt in the Netherlands.</p>",
  "<p>Per\u00fa es una de las naciones m\u00e1s ricas en posesi\u00f3n de minerales en el mundo y parece que todos buscan aprovecharse de este potencial. Gran parte de las zonas andinas y costeras, de norte a sur, est\u00e1n cedidas a la actividad minera. En una sola regi\u00f3n del sur, Apur\u00edmac, las concesiones mineras representan el 58,8% del territorio; en Cajamarca en el norte, donde se encuentra la mina de oro m\u00e1s grande en Am\u00e9rica Latina, equivalen al 48% del total.</p> <p>Sin embargo, estas \u00e1reas no son simples territorios vac\u00edos. Gran cantidad de peruanos viven en las mismas zonas de donde, a\u00f1o a a\u00f1o, se extraen toneladas de oro, zinc, esta\u00f1o y plomo, con consecuencias sociales y medioambientales. En lo que va del a\u00f1o ya son 10 las personas que han muerto por enfrentarse a la polic\u00eda durante los conflictos sociales presentados en tres regiones del pa\u00eds. Las muertes m\u00e1s recientes, ocurridas en Cajamarca, se dieron en medio de casi un a\u00f1o de rechazo a un multimillonario proyecto de oro y cobre, hoy paralizado por el temor de la poblaci\u00f3n a quedarse sin agua para sus actividades agr\u00edcolas y ganaderas.</p> <p>La miner\u00eda puede crear puestos de trabajo y generar riqueza. Adem\u00e1s, Newmont, la empresa de EE.UU. involucrada en el proyecto de oro en Cajamarca, hace hincapi\u00e9 en que su actividad extractiva no pondr\u00e1 en peligro el medio ambiente. A medida que contin\u00faan las protestas, todas las partes involucradas para tratar de encontrar una salida a este y otros conflictos mineros - es decir, los gobiernos central y regional, las empresas mineras, y los residentes locales - aseguran estar dispuestas a construir una nueva relaci\u00f3n basada en la confianza y el respeto.</p> <p>\"Tenemos que dise\u00f1ar e implementar un nuevo enfoque en el relacionamiento de las actividades extractivas con el ambiente, el aprovechamiento de los recursos naturales, la gesti\u00f3n equilibrada del territorio y el uso racional de los recursos h\u00eddricos\", dijo el presidente Ollanta Humala durante su discurso a la naci\u00f3n el 28 de julio.</p> <p>D\u00edas antes, un ejecutivo de Newmont en Lima, Carlos Santa Cruz, reiter\u00f3 la intenci\u00f3n de su compa\u00f1\u00eda de \"dialogar, encontrar salidas y construir juntos m\u00e1s oportunidades para todos\". Y en Cajamarca, un l\u00edder de las protestas locales, Edy Benavides, habl\u00f3 de la necesidad de no repetir los errores del pasado. \"Lo que las empresas mineras hacen es explotar el mineral y luego irse\", dijo. \"Lo que necesitamos es un desarrollo que sea sostenible para las generaciones futuras\".</p> <p>El mes pasado, el gobierno peruano cre\u00f3 una comisi\u00f3n permanente destinada a fomentar esta nueva relaci\u00f3n. A\u00fan tiene que hacer sus propuestas, pero Jos\u00e9 de Echave, quien renunci\u00f3 hace unos meses al Ministerio del Medio Ambiente a causa de la forma en c\u00f3mo el gobierno trat\u00f3 el conflicto en Cajamarca, dice que la comisi\u00f3n tiene que darse cuenta que en Per\u00fa, como en otros lugares, es posible tener una miner\u00eda sin dejar un impacto negativo en los residentes y el medio ambiente.</p> <p>\"En cualquier pa\u00eds serio del mundo con una alta dotaci\u00f3n de recursos nacionales, la autoridad ambiental es fuerte y pone regulaciones fuertes y sanciona a las empresas de manera fuerte\", dice. \"En Per\u00fa, no me parece que se est\u00e9 pidiendo algo fuera de proporci\u00f3n.\"</p> <p>El ex viceministro considera que el pa\u00eds andino puede implementar duras leyes ambientales, como en Australia o Canad\u00e1, sin temor a que las empresas mineras se vayan. Los precios de los minerales son altos y los dep\u00f3sitos m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles de encontrar, por lo que \u00e9l cree que las multinacionales se adaptar\u00edan a condiciones m\u00e1s estrictas. \"Adem\u00e1s si uno revisa los c\u00f3digos de conducta, de \u00e9tica de las propias empresas, ellos mismos dicen que sus operaciones responden siempre a los mejores est\u00e1ndares globales\", dice.</p> <p>De Echave es ahora un portavoz de Tierra y Libertad, un movimiento pol\u00edtico que tiene como objetivo proteger los derechos humanos y del medio ambiente, y que ha enviado una carta al presidente Humala inst\u00e1ndolo a promover mejores est\u00e1ndares internacionales y un desarrollo sostenible. \"No puede ser s\u00f3lo crecimiento econ\u00f3mico\", dice. \"Se deben mencionar las tres bases: la econ\u00f3mica, la social y la ambiental. Esas tres deben funcionar.\"</p> <p>Sin embargo, el ex funcionario reconoce que, por naturaleza, la miner\u00eda no explota un recurso sostenible. \"Creo que la idea es buscar un equilibrio\", concluye, \"para que esa actividad est\u00e9 compensada con otras actividades econ\u00f3micas que puedan ser importantes, significativas, sostenibles, quiz\u00e1s m\u00e1s amigables con la naturaleza y con los entornos sociales.\"</p> <p>Humala dice tambi\u00e9n querer lo mismo y viene buscando apoyo del Congreso para garantizar constitucionalmente el agua como derecho fundamental de todos los peruanos. La propuesta tiene por objeto proteger los recursos naturales como el agua de una explotaci\u00f3n minera depredadora y sin control.</p> <p>Los cr\u00edticos dicen que estos anuncios no son suficientes, argumentando que es necesario un cambio radical sobre c\u00f3mo las empresas mineras operan en Per\u00fa. Regiones como Huancavelica y Cajamarca est\u00e1n sentadas en riquezas minerales, pero, a pesar de haber tenido d\u00e9cadas de explotaci\u00f3n, sus habitantes son los m\u00e1s pobres del pa\u00eds. Con menos recursos disponibles, y persistentes conflictos sociales, De Echave dice que el cambio ser\u00e1 dif\u00edcil de aplicar, pero ahora parece inevitable.</p>",
  "<p>Managers at Edinburgh airport appear to have been learning the intricacies of public relations at the feet of Argyll and Bute council, quickly if belatedly reading the chapter marked: The Lessons of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/jun/15/school-meals-blogger-council-ban\">Martha Payne</a>. </p> <p>With all the deftness of a fully-laden Boeing 747, the airport today executed a sharp u-turn on their decision on Tuesday to cover up and then ban a poster carrying a widely-celebrated nude by Picasso from their international arrivals lounge.</p> <p>This morning, courtesy of the Times, it emerged that the airport's new owners Global Infrastructure Partners had reacted very hastily to a handful of complaints about a large advert for a new Edinburgh festivals exhibition featuring Picasso's Nude Woman in a Red Armchair, which went up there last week.</p> <p>Apparently, the nude's bare breasts \u2013 the poster was deliberately positioned in prime site near the arrivals gate - were regarded by at least one woman passenger (and others) as not the kind of welcome she expected in Scotland. So the airport placed a white vinyl cover over the offending area, as a temporary measure before it was removed. </p> <p>Buying that site was the biggest single item of marketing expenditure by National Galleries of Scotland for their new exhibition <a href=\" http://www.nationalgalleries.org/whatson/exhibitions/picasso-modern-british-art\">Picasso and Modern British Art </a>which opened on 4 August at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in time for this month's Edinburgh festivals. </p> <p>John Leighton, director general of the National Galleries of Scotland (NGS), which runs the gallery, said the airport had also asked for it to be removed, and replaced with something less controversial. He was nonplussed by the controversy. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-19177968\">Speaking before</a> the airport relented, he said: </p> <blockquote> <p>It is obviously bizarre that all kinds of images of women in various states of dress and undress can be used in contemporary advertising without comment, but somehow a painted nude by one of the world's most famous artists is found to be disturbing and has to be removed.</p> <p>I hope that the public will come and see the real thing, which is a joyous and affectionate portrait of one of Picasso's favourite models, an image that has been shown around the world.</p> </blockquote> <p>There were several reasons why Leighton was taken aback. The image had been used heavily and without complaint on the London underground for the same show at Tate Britain earlier this year. And it was given prior approval by the airport's managers and their advertising company JC Decaux. </p> <p>Happily for the National Galleries of Scotland, Edinburgh airport has learnt the lessons which Argyll and Bute council did back in June when they banned the now world-famous and celebrated <a href=\"http://neverseconds.blogspot.co.uk/\">Neverseconds blog</a> on school dinners by their pupil Martha Payne, and then lifted the ban in less than 24 hours.</p> <p>The National Galleries of Scotland had been now wrestling with what to do next: the advert took up a large chunk of the advertising budget for the Picasso and Modern British Art exhibition, and there is little time and money left to get approval from the Picasso estate to find a suitably strong new Picasso to replace it. A spokeswoman explained: </p> <blockquote> <p>The problem is that the Picasso estate has control over the majority of images in the show, and it would be quite a lengthy period of time to get that approval. We'd only just got that ad placed at the airport for the month so it's quite frustrating for that reason.</p> </blockquote> <p>Apparently it was all down to \"confusion\" at the airport. </p> <p>In a statement issued on Wednesday afternoon, an airport spokeswoman said:<br> </p> <blockquote> <p>We have now reviewed our original decision and reinstated the image. The initial decision was a reaction to passenger feedback, which we do always take seriously. However on reflection we are more than happy to display the image in the terminal and we'd like to apologise - particularly to the exhibition organisers - for the confusion.</p> <p>As well as returning the image to its original display we also hope that the interest assists in further promoting the Picasso and Modern British Art exhibition at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art to the many visitors in Edinburgh at the moment.</p> </blockquote> <p>Leighton has had one wish granted. He said before the ban was lifted he hoped the public \"will come and see the real thing, which is a joyous and affectionate portrait of one of Picasso's favourite models\". Thanks to the airport, word of the exhibition is, metaphorically at least, now flying around the world. But then Martha could've told anyone that. Her site has now had more than 7.6 million hits.</p>",

  "<p>The number of civilians killed in Afghanistan's war has fallen for the first time in over half a decade, the UN said, but officials warned that the decline is a \"hollow trend\" linked to an exceptionally harsh winter, rather than evidence of improved security.</p> <p>Some 3,099 non-combatants were killed or injured between January and July of this year, about 15% fewer than in the same period of 2011.</p> <p>It is the first time since the UN started keeping records in 2007 that there has been a fall in civilian casualties, but senior UN diplomats cautioned against reading it as a sign that after more than a decade of war the country is finally getting safer.</p> <p>\"The reduction in civilian casualties is welcome, but these gains are fragile. They do not reflect a move towards a peaceful society,\" said Nicholas Haysom, the deputy UN envoy to Afghanistan, at a news conference to launch the regular Protection of Civilians report.</p> <p>\"This report does not suggest that Afghans are necessarily safer or better protected in their communities.\"</p> <p>Targeted Taliban assassinations of government officials, tribal elders and other civilians whom insurgents consider their enemies have surged in the same period. And thousands of people fled their homes because of violence, so there are now nearly 115,000 internal refugees from fighting.</p> <p>The worst winter Kabul has seen in well over a decade probably contributed to a lower toll in the first months of the year, as bitter temperatures and heavy snow damped down violence.</p> <p>\"There was this exceptional decline not just in civilian casualties but of conflict related incidents overall,\" said James Rodehaver, deputy director of the UN's Human Rights Unit in Kabul.</p> <p>He highlighted the impact of a summer pick-up in fighting, saying deaths and injuries in July were about 5% higher than the same month in 2011.</p> <p>\"That is one of the reasons we would caution reading too much into the 15% overall reduction in casualties. That is a very hollow trend,\" Rodehaver said.</p> <p>\"The fact that were was a decline in May of this year, then a lower decline in June, and now an increase this July is rather telling, and I think it shows the direction the conflict may be heading in terms of impact on civilians.\"</p> <p>A rising toll in recent months would broadly fit with security data from the Nato-led coalition, which said that between April and June Taliban attacks on foreign and Afghan forces rose 11% from a year earlier.</p> <p>Despite the decline in overall deaths, the Taliban are still responsible for the vast majority of civilian casualties, \"around 80%\", and had shown no \"real or concerted attempt\" to cut back on the damage, Haysom said.</p> <p>Targeted assassinations are a particular concern, particularly when they use homemade bombs, which are both indiscriminate and disproportionate, the report said. These attacks soared by half compared with January to July 2011, with 255 people killed and 101 injured.</p> <p>The Taliban announced this year that they would target civilians \"who work against the Mujahideen\", even though the assassinations are not legal under international humanitarian and human rights laws, the UN said.</p> <p>The killing campaigns can weaken local government and intimidate small communities, who often feel they have little support from officials and security forces clustered into district centres, while the insurgents effectively control farmland and villages.</p> <p>\"UNAMA's discussion with Afghans in rural communities across the country reflected a common perception that anti-government elements exercise de facto control of areas or entire districts in many regions,\" the report said, citing a survey on Afghans' perceptions of security.</p>",
  "<p>The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has signed a \u00a319.6m control room contract<br>intended to deliver improvements including better call identification and<br>data sharing with other emergency services.</p> <p>A replacement for the LFB's existing control centre IT contract with<br>Motorola, which expires in 2014, was due to have been delivered through<br>the government's \u00a3469m FireControl project.</p> <p>FireControl was to have reduced the number of fire service control rooms<br>across the UK from 46 to nine.</p> <p>John Anthony, project director for control and mobilising services at<br>the LFB, who was the London representative for FireControl, said that<br>because of the failure of the project, the LFB has had to replace the<br>existing system itself.</p> <p>It has signed a 10 year contract with Capita and Anthony says that one<br>of the main aims of the deal is improve is the exchange of data between<br>the LFB, the Metropolitan Police, London Ambulance Service and possibly<br>utilities companies.</p> <p>\"At the moment we have a lot of voice communications with them and we<br>want to look at moving over to data transfer because it frees our staff for<br>call taking,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We already have some technology that provides call identification, but<br>the new system will improve the efficiency of that.\"</p> <p>The LFB also wants to introduce \"dynamic mobilising\" so that the nearest<br>fire engine is automatically sent to an incident.</p> <p>\"Now we base the vehicle sent out on the nearest fire station, which may<br>not be the nearest fire appliance,\" said Anthony. \"Using automatic vehicle<br>location, we will know where the nearest appliance is, irrespective of<br>which station the appliance belongs to.\"</p> <p>The Capita-run control system will be run from LFB's current control<br>centre in Merton, which was originally intended to be one of nine regional<br>control rooms set up for 20-25 years under FireControl.</p> <p>Anthony said that the brigade moved into the Merton building in January,<br>with an arrangement with the Department for Communities and Local<br>Government to pay two-thirds of the cost of the lease.</p> <p>\"Another key thing is that we have our main control system on a fall back<br>system, but we want to work with other fire services so we can share fall<br>back and resilience, which will improve services and reduce costs,\" said<br>Anthony.</p> <p>\"We will be working with Capita to achieve these aims.\"</p>",

They called their debut 2011 mixtape <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/piffgang/sets/piff-breaks-808s/\" title=\"\">Piff Breaks &amp; 808s</a> and they were invited onstage recently by A$AP Rocky at his gig in Camden \u2013 their music has the slow-paced clatter of Kanye's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/nov/21/kanye-west-808s-heartbreak\" title=\"\">808s and Heartbreak</a> and the spaced-out atmosphere of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxWNNHCrcFg\" title=\"\">the best A$AP</a>. The flow is languid, the rhythms mellow. They're fans of Odd Future \u2013 there are liberal sprinklings of \"swag\" in their lyrics and we even heard a \"bad milk\" that suggested a familiarity with Tyler, the Creator's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFTLouiUFjI\" title=\"\">Bastard</a>, and there's a creamy thickness to their sound that betrays a love of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/mar/05/new-band-main-attrakionz\" title=\"\">Main Attrakionz</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/03/kendrick-lamar-new-band\" title=\"\">the Black Hippy crew</a>.

Some have accused the group of sounding too American, but this is what they do, and whatever your view of it, there's no denying it's an antidote to everything else. \"We stand apart from UK rappers,\" they say. \"Everything else is grime or road rap.\"</p> <p>Unlike OF, who came across on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/12056212\" title=\"\">Earl</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk68dCUQjzE\" title=\"\">French</a> as brilliant but deranged, feral delinquents, Piff Gang present themselves as smooth criminals, high rollers living the high life in Harlesden. An unsigned band driving around in Mercs and Caddies, with an endless supply of Hennessy, rolling doobies and being endlessly pleasured by gorgeous acquiescent females? We wondered if this was a clever joke, a satire of the hollowness of the glamorous life a la Roxy Music's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSniBxXjK_8\" title=\"\">In Every Dream Home a Heartache</a>, or the result of sheer fantasy? So we asked Piff Gang's manager this morning just to check and he reassured us that, yup, they do live this life. \"They always ask me why we talk about smoking, fucking bitches and partying,\" one of the Gang told a journalist recently. \"I always say to them that's cos we smoke, fuck bitches and party. It makes sense, no?\" In a way, minus the rage and confusion, the warped morality, this is less defensible than Tyler et al. And yet this after-hours, late-night, piffed-out rap is so seductive, you forgive them everything.

  "<p>When might it be in the best interests of a Jewish 10-year-old to be baptised as a Christian? That was the question Judge Platt had to decide at Romford county court in Essex earlier this year. His <a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/Misc/2012/15.html\" title=\"\">judgment</a>, released for publication at the end of last week, makes fascinating reading.</p> <p>It involves a couple who were divorced in 2010 after 14 years of marriage. They had two children: a girl who is now nearly 11 and a boy who is nearly six. Both parents are Jewish, as are all four grandparents.</p> <p>As usual in such cases, the family cannot be identified. But the impression one gets from the judgment is of an extended family that is culturally Jewish rather than religiously committed. According to the father, neither his own parents nor his former wife's parents \"have ever strictly observed what would be regarded as the outward manifestations of the Jewish faith, for example by regular attendance at the synagogue or observance of Jewish festivals or kosher dietary rules\".</p> <p>That approach was followed by the father and mother themselves, the judge found. \"The only occasions on which they attended the synagogue were as guests at a wedding or bar mitzvah celebration. Neither of them took any steps to provide the children with any instruction in the Jewish religion; nor did they celebrate or observe any of the religious festivals in the Jewish calendar. They would often be at work on Jewish holy days.\"</p> <p>So their children grew up without any religious beliefs or practices - even in the home, which Jews regard as more important than the synagogue for these purposes. After their divorce, the couple agreed that their two children should live with each parent alternately for a week at a time.</p> <p>What made things more complicated was that the father had decided to become a Christian. After the marriage had come to an end but while the couple were still living under the same roof, the father experienced what he described as a meeting with God. \"He started attending church each Sunday which naturally excited the interest of his children,\" the judge said. \"They asked if they could come with him and, with the agreement of the mother, they have been attending church regularly ever since.\"</p> <p>Last summer, the father took both children to a Christian residential event, run by <a href=\"http://www.new-wine.org/home/about-us\" title=\"\">New Wine</a>, a well-established group of local churches which wants \"to see the church become a missionary movement\". On the way back, the daughter told her father that she, too, had experienced an encounter with God and wished to be baptised.</p> <p>After the daughter had told her mother this, the mother applied for an injunction to stop the father baptising or confirming either child. The application was made without notice to the father.</p> <p>When the father heard that a temporary order had been made against him, he complained that his former wife had given their daughter the impression that the couple were fighting over an issue that they should have resolved without going to court. Judge Platt agreed that \"by choosing the route of confrontation rather than negotiation, she has presented [the daughter] with a picture of her parents at war, which is deeply distressing to the child and has caused her emotional distress\".</p> <p>But what was the judge to do now? By law, his \"<a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/section/1\" title=\"\">paramount consideration</a>\" must be the \"child's welfare\". The court has no power to order the girl to baptised. What the judge had to do was to decide whether he should stop the father from taking steps leading towards the child's baptism, as the mother had asked.</p> <p>In the end, the judge was satisfied that the child's \"welfare interests are best served by allowing her to be enrolled in a baptism class and to present herself for baptism into the Christian church as soon as she is ready\". However, the judge ruled that her confirmation into the church should not take place before she is 16, unless the mother agrees.</p> <p>Tellingly, the judge found that the girl's \"upbringing for the first eight years of her life lacked any significant religious teaching upon which her own moral compass could be based. Her exposure to Christian teaching and her positive reaction to that clearly indicates that she has an emotional need which is being met by this experience.\"</p> <p>After the parents had separated, the mother's only concession to this emotional need was to light what the judge describes as \"a candle\" at home on Friday nights. Since Jewish custom is to welcome the sabbath by lighting two candles, and sometimes more, I hope that this was an error by the judge rather than by the mother.</p> <p>The mother also did herself no favours by asking a rabbi from the strictly orthodox Lubavitch movement to write a letter to the court. The rabbi, based at Buckhurst Hill in Essex, had clearly not been given the full facts of the case.</p> <p>So it was left to Judge Platt to set out his own knowledge of Jewish law, while explaining that it had played no part in his decision-making process because it was not based on expert evidence. As he understood it, \"a person who is born a Jew cannot deprive himself of his Jewish status. Christian baptism does not have any effect on that status. The purported act of conversion to Christianity simply has no legal effect and [the child] would therefore be free to resume her Jewish faith at any time if she wished to do so.\"</p> <p>That strikes me as entirely accurate. One may <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/may/14/guardianobituaries.religion\" title=\"\">become a bishop</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/oct/02/guardianobituaries.france\" title=\"\">a cardinal</a> and still remain Jewish under Jewish law.</p> <p>The judge also went to some lengths to help the girl understand what he had decided, writing her a letter in child-friendly language. \"Being baptised does not mean that you give up your Jewish heritage,\" he told her. \"That will always be part of you and I hope that you will continue to learn more about that heritage and about your mother's faith.</p> <p>\"Even after you are baptised you are still free to change your mind about your faith later when you are older. Finally, and this is the most important thing, both your mother and father will carry on loving you just as much whatever happens about your baptism.\"</p> <p>Judge Platt directed that the child was not to be shown a copy of his judgment, though it is now a public document and there is nothing to stop her finding it and reading it.</p> <p>What are we to make of this ruling? It rather depends on one's starting point.</p> <p>Legally, it strikes me as impeccable. The girl is a bright and intelligent child, academically advanced and able to express her views. As a result of her upbringing, and no doubt as a result of her parents' divorce, she has emotional needs which she wishes to satisfy through religious practice. She has seized on the first religious experience to which she has been exposed.</p> <p>If one of her parents had adopted an observant Jewish lifestyle and then exposed her to it, she might just as easily espoused the religion of her birth. As the judge correctly observed, that remains possible. People change as they grow older.</p> <p>The girl may be strengthened by her new-found religious faith. Or she may become confused and disillusioned. Odom Brandman, the Lubavitch rabbi from Buckhurst Hill, was wise to tell the court that Jews \"don't encourage conversion either way, as it is unnatural for a person to change the religion they are born into and which thus is ingrained in their soul\".</p> <p>One should not be too hard on the girl's parents. By all accounts, they were bringing their children up in the same way as they themselves had been brought up. Cultural Judaism can be a strong force for good.</p> <p>And what if your starting point is non-religious? You may well think that it would have been in the child's best interests if she could have remained entirely secular, as she had been for the first eight years of her life. Let her choose when she grows up, some might say.</p> <p>But the wider lesson from this case is that it is surely desirable to give one's children some sort of ethical structure to cling on to as they grow up - beyond teaching them obedience to their parents and the difference between right and wrong, as these two children were properly taught. It may be one of the world's established religions, provided it is taught in a loving, measured way. It may well be humanism, atheism or even agnosticism. But it must surely be something.</p>",
  "<p>The peacockery that goes on in the minutes before the athletes hunker down for their races is not just a compelling element of the spectator experience of these Olympics. It is a pre-match press conference, wordless but full of clear messages. It is a part of the contest itself.</p> <p>The swimmers emerge in their capes, bobbing mutely to their iPods: pure Rocky. Usain Bolt clowns around, doing a faultless impression of a competitor who isn't really focussed on the race. And then, when the gun starts, it turns out that he was just messing with our heads. Of the female sprinters, one has proved herself a champion of both the track and the starting block mind-games: Sanya Richards-Ross, winner of her 400m race and silver medallist in the 200m.</p> <p>Richards-Ross emerged on to the track with a look designed to both confuse and intimidate. While other runners wear ponytails or plaits \u2013 one would assume this is more practical \u2013 Richards-Ross had only the top few inches of her hair in braids, so that the rest of it tumbled in golden waves. As the TV cameras watched, she put her hands up to her hair, and it seemed for a moment she meant to tie it back - but no, she was merely fanning it out over her shoulders, the better to show off both her gleaming curls, and the large double-C gold Chanel earrings she wore. The message to her women in the other lanes was crystal clear: you may be athletes, but I am a goddess.</p> <p>It was a masterclass in sporting intimidation, but also a positive statement of self-belief from an athlete who has shaken off persistent health problems to realise her potential during this Games. Lustrous hair is a signal of health and vitality; showing it off on race day sent a clear message that she believed herself to be in fine health.</p> <p>Many athletes wear sentimental or lucky jewellery, Richards-Ross included: she wears around her neck a bullet her mother gave her as a schoolgirl athlete (as in: faster than a speeding bullet, apparently.) The Chanel earrings she wore to race in are more unusual, a worldly choice that made her look like she might be about to take to the stage for an arena tour, rather than run around the track. And since bling has always been a very competitive aesthetic, they only add to the aura of a woman rising to a challenge.</p> <p>And then there are the clothes. Specifically, the arm-warmer sleeves, which - besides whatever physiological function they perform - serve to showcase and highlight the incredible musculature of Richards-Ross's arms and shoulders. (Many people noticed this - including, it seemed, the camera operator, who kept the lens trained on Richards-Ross for a disproportionate time.) They also look reminiscent of knee-high socks, lending a cheerleader-ish note to the outfit which will not have passed unnoticed by the runner, who is married to an NFL athlete. The sleeves add to the sense that this could be a stage get-up - Rihanna meets Britney - which in turn, helps frame the race as being the Richards-Ross show.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was corrected on 9 August 2012 because the original said Sanya Richards-Ross is married to an NBA athlete, when in fact her husband is a player in the NFL.</p>",
  "<p>The facts will speak for themselves, proclaimed Gu Kailai's son, Bo Guagua, as his mother prepared to stand trial on Thursday for the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood. But few others have such confidence in the transparency of a politicised case in a country where 98% of hearings end in conviction, and where state media has announced there is irrefutable proof against Gu and her codefendant.</p> <p>The location is telling. Hefei, the capital of eastern Anhui province, is 600 miles south of Beijing and further still from Chongqing, the scene of the alleged murder, where Gu's husband, Bo Xilai, is still popular despite his ousting as party secretary. The industrial city has no obvious advantage as the site of the highest-profile Chinese trial in decades, beyond its relative obscurity. Few here show much interest in, or knowledge of, the case, although many in China are wary of discussing such sensitive issues with foreigners.</p> <p>\"Who's that?\" replied one resident, asked if he was aware of Gu's case. Told that she was Bo's wife, he asked bemusedly: \"Why is she standing trial here?\"</p> <p>\"In Chongqing, people would have said there is a local bias either for or against,\" Fran\u00e7ois Godement, a Chinese politics expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told AP. \"In Beijing, it would have been a high-profile political case.\"</p> <p>The scandal is particularly sensitive given the transfer of power to a new generation of leaders this autumn. Bo had been tipped by some for promotion in that shake-up.</p> <p>Some experts have surmised that the Anhui judiciary may be seen as more than usually politically reliable. All courts in China are under Communist party control, but the system here was previously overseen by Wang Shengjun, now head of China's supreme people's court.</p> <p>Behind the austere facade of the spacious Hefei intermediate people's court, the courtroom is too cramped for foreign media to watch as Gu, 53, and family employee Zhang Xiaojun, 33, stand trial, officials insist. The hearing is expected to last two days at most. Two British diplomats will attend in a consular capacity and it is thought that each defendant will be allowed two relatives in court.</p> <p>State media have alleged that Gu killed Heywood because she feared for her son's safety after an economic conflict.</p> <p>Bo Guagua wrote in an <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/07/world/asia/china-bo-guagua-statement/index.html\" title=\"\">email</a> to CNN: \"As I was cited as a motivating factor for the crimes accused of my mother, I have already submitted my witness statement. I hope that my mother will have the opportunity to review them.\"</p> <p>Bo, who has remained in the US since graduating from Harvard this summer, added: \"I have faith that facts will speak for themselves.\"</p> <p>Friends of Heywood fear the dead man is being smeared so Gu, who might otherwise face the death penalty, can use her concern for her son as a mitigating factor. They do not believe he would have threatened the family and least of all Bo, to whom he was closest. \"He is not the person who has been portrayed \u2013 some kind of sleazeball,\" said one.</p> <p>Heywood was part of Gu's inner circle until he fell out with her some years ago. But friends say he remained on good terms with Bo; one said the two spoke almost daily at times, although another thought it more a case of occasional social contact.</p> <p>\"Heywood is in no position to answer any of this,\" said Glenn Tiffert an expert on Chinese law at the University of California, Berkeley. \"They can paint him almost any way they want, because there's not going to be anyone to contest that in proceedings.\"</p> <p>Tiffert added that an alleged confession by Gu would have been made \"under considerable duress \u2013 duress that would call into question the credibility of the confession in our system\". He said it was in defendants' interests to confess because it suggested they had accepted some moral responsibility for their actions, which could be taken into account in sentencing. At the same time, officials wanted an admission to help justify the outcome of the trial.</p> <p>Witnesses rarely appear in court, with cases usually relying on statements, but there is speculation that Patrick Devillers, the French architect who was also part of Gu's circle, may give evidence. He was detained by authorities in Cambodia at China's request and subsequently flew to China, with Cambodian officials saying he was wanted as a witness.</p> <p>Experts think authorities are likely to be punctilious in complying with legal requirements given the close scrutiny. But</p> <p>Kerry Brown, head of the Asia programme at Chatham House, said: \"No one in their right mind would see Gu's trial as nonpolitical. There is no way on this planet her trial outcome will not, finally, be signed off at politburo level.\"</p> <p>He suggested it formed part of a political narrative, justifying Bo's removal because he and his associates were \"bad\" people. He also noted the convenience of focusing on a murder charge, excluding the economic crimes to which Gu reportedly confessed.</p> <p>\"A trial about economic corruption runs the risk of raising the question of how they [senior leaders] are all implicated. Murder doesn't,\" said Brown. \"None of this means she actually did murder Heywood, but I suppose in their hearts the leadership must think that even in being implicated in this mess, she, and Bo, screwed up. So now they take the consequences.\"</p>",
  "<p>Week after week, we have seen dramatic allegations of malfeasance at UK and US banks. First, we have Libor fixing, then HSBC's \"pervasively polluted\" culture helping Mexican drug traffickers, and now detailed allegations that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/06/standard-chartered-iran-transactions\">Standard Chartered has colluded with the Iranian regime to illegally transfer sums totaling $250bn</a>.</p> <p>On 5 October 2005, the head of Standard Chartered Americas wrote to the bank's top brass in London about the \"very serious or even catastrophic reputational damage\" that could be caused by some of the UK institution's transactions involving Iran. He warned that the bank's behaviour could lead to \"serious criminal liability\" for senior management, including himself.</p> <p>Nearly seven years later, Standard Chartered <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/07/standard-chartered-rogue-bank-or-victim\">stands accused by the New York banking regulator of operating as a \"rogue institution\"</a> by deliberately altering wire transfers involving Iran to evade American sanctions. What appears to be perhaps even more concerning about this week's bank sleaze charges is that Standard Chartered allegedly perpetrated a \"staggering cover-up\" by repeatedly providing false information to the regulators. The bank's accounting firm Deloitte is also accused of aiding it by deliberately withholding important information from the authorities.</p> <p>Standard Chartered denied the allegations saying that it \"strongly rejects the position and portrayal of facts\" made by the New York State Department of Financial Services, and <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/08/07/iran-accusations-against-bank-surprised-regulators-too/?hp\">claiming that \"99.9%\" of its transactions complied with regulations</a>. Deloitte said that it \"had no knowledge of any alleged misconduct by bank employees\". We will have to wait and see whether these allegations are proven; at a hearing next week, the bank will have to justify why it should keep its New York banking licence.</p> <p>What is not new is the apparent contempt \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/lawskys-go-it-alone-attack-on-standard-chartered-angers-us-regulators-2012-8\">as the New York regulator called it</a> \u2013 with which banks appear to treat their government supervisors. It is easy to imagine why (and some senior officials will admit this off the record): the risks and rewards are unbalanced. When banks get things wrong, at the worst they escape with a slap on the wrist and a fine that may seem large but is usually only a fraction of the bank's profits. Meanwhile, lucrative business leads to lucrative bonuses for individual bankers behind the schemes. The end result is that shareholders bear the risks and pay the price, while individual bankers get rewarded for their \"swashbuckling\".</p> <p>It is worth personalising this for a moment. The current UK government minister and former HSBC boss, Lord Green, took home \u00a315m in salary and bonuses while presiding over a bank that is accused of providing a conduit for \"drug kingpins and rogue nations\". He may be a wonderful trade minister but there is a basic issue of accountability that needs to be addressed here. So far, Green has yet to give his money back to hard-pressed shareholders, who may have to pay up to $1bn in fines. Peter Sands, as Standard Chartered's current boss and finance director from 2002 until 2006, should have played an important oversight role over the bank's operations during the period that the Iran scheme was allegedly carried out. As should have Lord Davis, a former UK Labour trade minister who preceded Sands as the bank's CEO.&#xa0;</p> <p>Last year, the UK financial regulator, the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CGIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fsa.gov.uk%2Fpubs%2Fother%2Faml_final_report.pdf&amp;ei=DXUiUPyICdKzhAe4g4DQAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFhkQlVVg90O3uRDp--al0phr6UKA\">Financial Services Authority published a remarkably revealing review (pdf)</a> of how banks in Britain comply with anti-money laundering protocols. It found that in a third of cases, banks were prepared to take very high money-laundering risks if they felt they wouldn't be found out.</p> <p>The sheer scale and extent of the malfeasance apparently revealed in these recent scandals suggests that this is also not a case of just a few bad apples within a bank. The New York banking regulator claims that the success of Standard Chartered's Iranian business stems from the \"documented willingness of its most senior management to deceive regulators and violate US law\". In the case of HSBC, emails have <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2012/07/2012716213139157207.html\">emerged that suggest the bank's management were informed</a> of the anti-money laundering problems at the bank.&#xa0;</p> <p>Something seems very rotten in the banking industry. Shareholders and governments must do more to fix this problem.</p> <p>First, and most importantly, senior bank management needs to be held personally liable for serious violations of the law. The threat of losing their fancy houses, lucrative bonuses and reputation in high society may spur executives to treat the law and its enforcers with a little more respect. Compliance and ethical behaviour need to be clearly benchmarked \u2013 and any bonuses awarded to senior staff properly clawed back if malfeasance subsequently comes to light. This is also a duty for shareholders, who have seriously lost out following the publications of the allegations about Standard Chartered.</p> <p>The prospect of a prison cell would certainly focus minds. The crimes alleged are massive, and where proved true, of a breathtaking scale, earning hundreds of million dollars in rewards, while assisting terrorists, tyrants and drug traffickers. The punishment now needs to fit those crimes. Prison and penury would certainly focus minds of potential future banksters.</p>",
  "<p>If you were present at an Edinburgh comedy show these past few years and didn't hear a joke about restrictions on an easyJet flight, there was an unwritten law that you could ask for your money back. Same if you missed a gag about Josef Fritzl. If you never saw an extended routine about internet porn, meanwhile, you got your cash <em>and</em> a T-shirt.</p> <p>A lot of shows in Edinburgh are whimsical or surreal, others are based around formative moments of the performer's life. But a large, perhaps the largest, number are of the observational stripe. To make such a show requires material with which the audience can identify; working out what that might be is something of a skill in itself.</p> <p>Someone who's very good at it, at least judging by the response from his audience the other night, is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshwiddicombe\" title=\"\">Josh Widdicombe</a>. Nominated for best newcomer in last year's Foster's Comedy awards and star of Channel 4's Stand Up for the Week, Josh learned everything he knows (well, mainly) as a shift worker on the Guardian's sports site. So a disclaimer \u2013 I know the guy, but there's no doubting his ability to narrow in to comic effect on things that people recognise.</p> <p>Widdicombe's on-stage persona is something of the Seinfeld; the consumer-citizen baffled and, occasionally, incensed by the objects and habits around him. The thing I think Widdicombe is notable for is his knack of noting things that are relevant to his generation (Widdicombe is 29). It's rarely profound; advertising at cash points, the battery life of smartphones, the background props in hip-hop videos. But it works. People recognise his observations and experiences, Widdicombe articulates wittily things they might have felt themselves.</p> <p>Widdicombe has material that's of its age. This is no mean feat. But it's material that communicates broadly too. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ladycariad\" title=\"\">Cariad Lloyd</a>, another newcomer nominee of last year, has a character in her set that's also very much of the moment. She's called Jooooey Bechamel but some readers might be forgiven for noticing a similarity between her name and that of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZooeyDeschanel\" title=\"\">Zooey Deschanel</a>, actor, singer and cutesy star of US sitcom New Girl. Others will not notice anything however, just like a good three-quarters of the crowd watching Lloyd's show with me.</p> <p>From my point of view, Lloyd has picked a smart, relevant target for satire. The kooky, ditzy Deschanel character is glamorous and, to use the internet term, \"adorkable\". She's also, notes Lloyd, \"a child with breasts\" who fascinates men because 'they like you clever, but not as clever as them!\"</p> <p>It's topical, sharp satire on a hipster icon. The only problem is, not many people know or indeed care about hipster icons. That doesn't make the material bad or indeed not worth doing, but it might leave a comic experiencing less laughter than they might hope for. In these circumstances, you wonder whether the performer might be hoping for an easyJet joke in their backpocket.</p> <h2>Trendwatch</h2> <p>This year, so far, there's been lots of mention of the Olympics (obvs), the Guardian (standard byword for \"right on\"), Robert Mugabe (this year's go-to dictator?), Pret a Manger (now a nationwide bourgeois experience) and, bizarrely, the Crystal Maze.</p>",
  "<p>The truth of scientific discovery is this: though the work may be done by an exceptional team, the world only gets to know about one exceptional individual. It would seem that in a world of citations, publications and conference presentations, every academic needs to know one thing: that career progression is dependent on oneself.</p> <p>But the reality, of course, is that no man is an island and scientists, and indeed all researchers, are dependent on others - and at no other time is that more obvious that at the start of one's career.</p> <p>Making the case for mentoring, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2011/sep/09/academic-mentoring-professional-network\" title=\"\">Janni Aragon</a> says: \"Most academics do not enter graduate school knowing how to artfully construct a CV, apply for a position, grant, or give conference presentation.

It is also worth talking about the different ways of giving and receiving support - what, for example, is the difference between mentoring, coaching and sponsoring?</p> <p>The aim of our live chat, this Friday 10 August, is to explore these issues and answer these questions.

  "<h2>Best of this week's news</h2> <p>Halfway through week one of the fringe, and the big story is \u2013 well, pretty much the same as last week's big story. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/jul/30/stewart-lee-slow-death-edinburgh-fringe\">Stewart Lee's broadside against the commercialisation of Edinburgh comedy</a> (see below) set the agenda for the opening days of festival 2012, with Edinburgh comedy award director Nica Burns responding to it in her annual pep talk at the weekend. Burns dismissed Lee's grumble as part of \"a bit of competition to create controversy\", and set against his claims the argument that <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/edinburgh-festivals/all-articles/free-fringe-shows-come-of-age-in-the-battle-for-awards-1-2452190\" title=\"Free Fringe shows come of age in the battle for awards\">free shows are now as important to the fringe as ticketed events</a>.

One of the two chiefs of the Underbelly venue, Ed Bartlam, whom Lee attacked in his Guardian article last week, <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/edinburgh-festivals/all-articles/stewart-lee-s-jibe-at-etonian-cabal-behind-comedyfest-unfair-1-2447434\" title=\"tewart Lees jibe at Etonian cabal behind comedyfest unfair\">responded at that venue's fringe launch</a>, claiming that the Underbelly is dedicated to \"new shows, new writing and new talent\", and brushing off Lee's derogatory reference to his and co-director Charlie Wood's privileged background. Bartlam said he and Wood had \"never made any bones about the fact we are from Eton \u2026 We were Etonians when Stewart had three or four very successful years performing with us,\" he added.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the row about the rights to the Assembly brand shows no signs of abating. This one <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-17914307\" title=\"Edinburgh Fringe rivals fight over Assembly venue name\">kicked off in the spring</a>, when William Burdett-Coutts, who ran the central fringe venue for 30 years until it closed in 2011, requested that its new operator change the venue's name. Burdett-Coutts has retained the Assembly name for his current operation, based in George Square, while his old, City council-owned venue has reopened under the management of Stand Comedy Club chief Tommy Sheppard. Verbal blows were exchanged again this week, as Sheppard argued that: \"Everyone who has ever been to the festival knows exactly where the Assembly Rooms are, and they are open for business like they have never been before.\" You can say that again. <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/edinburgh-festivals/all-articles/assembly-rooms-chief-admits-errors-over-horrific-queue-management-1-2453409\" title=\"Assembly Rooms chief admits errors over horrific queue management \">Sheppard was back in the papers</a> days later apologising for \"horrific queue management\" at the Assembly Rooms, after audiences complained about \"overcrowded foyer areas, long queues to get into shows and late-running performances\". \"We are,\" he said, in words that may prompt hollow laughter over at George Square, \"victims of our own success.\"</p> <h2>Best of your comments</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394439085\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/8/3/1344008574675/Daniel-Kitson-008.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Kitson\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The standup Holden Caulfield \u2026 Kitson.

  "<p>I was listening to the Police Federation spokesman, Paul McKeever, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/listen_again/default.stm\" title=\"\">on Radio 4 this morning</a>. He was pouring tepid water over a thinktank report suggesting the cops might like to invest some time and money in training citizens on techniques to defuse the kind of antisocial behaviour that will resume on our streets when the Olympics are over.</p> <p>\"Sorry mate, it's the government's budget cuts. We can't afford the idea,\" said McKeever, good trade unionist that he is. \"It's our job anyway.\" So much for the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) report published this morning on behalf of the Centre for London researcher, Ben Rogers, which is not ashamed to deploy the Fleet St cliche about \"have-a-go heroes\" but realises it can be dangerous. Alan Travis's Guardian report is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/aug/08/have-a-go-hero-training-for-public-urged\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p> <p>But it's an intriguing idea all the same. Everyone rehearses in their mind what they might \u2013 or might not \u2013 do when confronted with ugly behaviour, vandalism, excess noise, even violence on a bus, in the pub or on the street. I certainly do. On Brighton beach only yesterday I saw some kids, clearly down from London on a rare visit to the seaside, hurling stones with cheerful abandon \u2013 unmalicious but risky. I told them to be careful, but did so kindly. They were only kids.</p> <p>The RSA's report \u2013 <a href=\"http://2020psh.org/?p=1110\" title=\"\">First Aid Approaches to Managing Anti-Social Behaviour</a> \u2013 says that last August's riots showed both the strength and weakness of civil action (remember the broom brigades that cleaned up?) and that a radical new \"citizen's defence\" approach is needed to enable the public-spirited to evaluate a situation so that they can decide if it is appropriate, or wise, to intervene, as well as how to defend themselves if things go wrong.</p> <p>Police budget cuts make it more necessary not less, Rogers argues. So does the imminent arrival of elected police commissioners, who should champion lay training on what is known as the Woolwich model, which was introduced after riots there in 1878 and gradually spread across the world. In our unruly world the public is concerned about low-level disorder, but is not well-equipped to do anything useful.</p> <p>\"With the real prospect of traditional police patrols being scaled back, now is surely the time to focus seriously on agreeing the core skills that active citizens need \u2013 individually or collectively \u2013 if they're to step up to the mark. The coalition government has signalled its determination to encourage and support citizens to \"have a go\" and intervene to stop criminal behaviour. But to do this, citizens need training and the government needs a strategy if these emerging ideas are to be supported and developed, says Rogers.</p> <p>Specifically he suggests:</p> <p>\u2022 Police officers or lay trainers should provide training to local people about how to deal low-level antisocial behaviour</p> <p>\u2022 Training should also be given to frontline public servants, including park keepers, public transport workers, street cleaners, parking enforcement officers, caretakers, teachers and other school staff, social workers, community and youth workers and neighbourhood managers</p> <p>\u2022 People such as shopkeepers, publicans and postal workers, who are not in public service but are present and potentially influential within their communities. could also benefit from training</p> <p>\u2022 Training should include a) self-protection and restraint \u2013 what physical steps to take to minimise the risk to oneself b) how to read a situation - to appraise when it's appropriate to walk on by, when it's safe to intervene or when to call the police, and c) conflict resolution and mediation skills \u2013 how to defuse an argument, forge an agreement and where appropriate elicit an apology.</p> <p>This strikes me as sensible stuff. When we were small \u2013 in the innocent 1950s \u2013 the kind of people mentioned above, from teachers to park keepers and bus conductors, were figures of authority whom you generally obeyed. Your parents took their side in a clash, not yours. Now it common for us all to challenge authority more readily, with the predictable result that there is less experienced and confident authority to go round \u2013 at a time when it is much needed.</p> <p>Fortunately, there are always some people who will stand up for themselves and their community. It is humbling to read of an elderly lady chasing away burglars with a broom, or of a woman \u2013 it's often a woman - who eventually brings her estate's hooligan gang under control despite the best efforts of police and assorted folk in authority to ignore the problem. I could say more. So could you.</p> <p>To his credit Tony Blair tried to tackle low-level disorder via the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Social_Behaviour_Order\" title=\"\">Asbo system</a>, now officially frowned on as ineffectual. The coalition promises to replace it with something better. We'll see if it does \u2013 or even tries. It's frightening and depressing when people, not all of them elderly, say they are afraid to go out at night or even at other times, afraid to open the door. It's also infectious.</p> <p>So I was pleased to learn that Rogers (who has another report out highlighting the weakness of David Cameron's Big Society devolution) attributes some of his ideas to a small charity I'd not heard of until today. Founded in 2007 by Jane Atkinson, a former housing manager, it's called <a href=\"http://dfuse.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Dfuse</a> and it trains people to handle conflict, aggression and anti-social malarky.</p> <p>Not in Syria, but the stuff we see on our streets. By chance I mentioned this in the presence of my wife's morning walking partner, Sue, who is a very busy person. As such she had found time to do one of Dfuse's courses, along with her Citizens Advice work, her hobbies, voluntary activities, gardening and cardiovascular exercise. She says the course was terrific.</p> <p>No surprise that \u2013 if I have got this bit right \u2013 the crucial insight is that an intervention should be non-threatening, calm, even cheerful. That's roughly what I'd figured out in my head, that I'd first have to strangle the adrenalin surge which is never far from the surface and put on a smile. Fortunately I've not been involved in fisticuffs since my <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2001/nov/05/labour.uk\" title=\"\">misunderstanding with Alastair Campbell</a> more than 20 years ago.</p> <p>Even longer ago, when the family lived in the respectable suburbs of Washington, we went to a neighbourhood watch meeting where everyone was all fired up against street crime and burglary. \"If we get an intruder should we blow him away?\" I recall an old fellow asking the cop, whose budget allowed him to come and give advice.</p> <p>\"No. He's more likely to blow you away instead,\" came the sensible answer. It's still good advice, albeit unheroic by have-a-go standards. Intervention can make a difference and we should never be afraid of children. But most antisocial behaviour is perpetrated by adults \u2013 from feral gangs to restaurant-wrecking posh boys (no names) \u2013 and some of them are seriously psychotic.</p> <p>Best to know what you may be taking on. And, as with those Olympic medals, that needs training.</p>",
  "<p>A man with Parkinson's disease who was arrested during the Olympic men's cycling road race while sitting beside the route has said he wants a \"letter of exoneration\" from Surrey police, claiming their treatment of him was disproportionate.</p> <p>Mark Worsfold, 54, a former soldier and martial arts instructor, was arrested on 28 July for a breach of the peace shortly before the cyclists arrived in Redhouse Park, Leatherhead, where he had sat down on a wall to watch the race. Officers from Surrey police restrained and handcuffed him and took him to Reigate police station, saying his behaviour had \"caused concern\".</p> <p>\"The man was positioned close to a small group of protesters and based on his manner, his state of dress and his proximity to the course, officers made an arrest to prevent a possible breach of the peace,\" Surrey police said in a statement.</p> <p>Worsfold, whose experience was first reported by Private Eye, claims police questioned him about his demeanour and why he had not been seen to be visibly enjoying the event. Worsfold, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 2010, suffers from muscle rigidity that affects his face. He was released after two hours without charge or caution.</p> <p>\"It could have been done better. I was arrested for not smiling. I have Parkinson's,\" he said, adding that he realised the officers were working long hours and trying to control the event properly, but they had not, in his case, acted correctly. He said he did not want to make further comment until he received a response from Surrey police.</p> <p>Worsfold, who teaches martial arts in Leatherhead, climbed Mount Kilimanjaro last February for the Save the Rhino charity.</p> <p>Surrey police said: \"There were a number of factors which led officers to make this arrest, including the fact that the race was rapidly approaching, the heightened level of security due to the high-profile nature of the event and the sheer number of spectators in attendance. These were fully explained to the individual concerned. He was given words of advice and released with no further action.\"</p> <p>They added that Worsfold had had \"a number of knives\" in his possession, but that these turned out to be made of rubber and for use only as display items.</p> <p>The statement said: \"Surrey police has received a letter from the man in which he has said that he 'fully understands and appreciates the action taken by officers'. He has also said that he 'appreciated and thanked both the arresting officers for their apologies and explanations' following his release.\"</p> <p>Chief Superintendent Gavin Stephens said: \"Officers were policing huge numbers of people during the Olympic events and in the interests of public safety they acted quickly and decisively based on the information available to them.\"</p> <p>Campaigners, however, said the incident was illustrative of the kind of \"chronic misunderstandings\" people with Parkinson's have to deal with regularly. \"Sadly Mark's experience highlights the lack of understanding and compassion that many people currently living with Parkinson's have to deal with every day,\" said Laura Bowey, head of information and support at Parkinson's UK.</p> <p>\"Despite affecting over 127,000 people in the UK, people with Parkinson's are subject to chronic misunderstandings and misconceptions about the condition. All too frequently people with Parkinson's tell us how are they are accused of being drunk, or acting suspiciously as they go about their daily lives.</p> <p>\"Parkinson's is a complex condition, and those living with it can experience a range of different symptoms that can vary almost on an hourly basis. We hope that Mark's experience will help to raise awareness of this distressing problem and will be a reminder to be careful about making the wrong assumptions about people who have Parkinson's.\"</p>",
  "<p>Three members of the feminist punk band Pussy Riot said Vladimir Putin's Russia was the one on trial as they delivered closing arguments on Wednesday in a case seen as a key test of the powerful president's desire to crackdown on dissent.</p> <p>\"This is a trial of the whole government system of Russia, which so likes to show its harshness toward the individual, its indifference to his honour and dignity,\" Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 22, one of the trio on trial said in an impassioned statement. \"If this political system throws itself against three girls \u2026 it shows this political system is afraid of truth.\"</p> <p>The judge set 17 August as the day she would deliver a verdict against the women, charged with hooliganism motivated by religious hatred following an anti-Putin performance in a Moscow cathedral.</p> <p>Prosecutors have asked for a three-year sentence, arguing that the women sought to insult all of Russian Orthodoxy and denying they were carrying out a political protest.</p> <p>Tolokonnikova called the charges against them a \"political order for repression\" and denounced Putin's \"totalitarian-authoritarian system\", insisting Pussy Riot were an example of \"opposition art\".</p> <p>\"Even though we are behind bars, we are freer than those people,\" she said, looking at the prosecution from inside the glass cage where she and her two bandmates, Maria Alyokhina and Yekaterina Samutsevich, have spent the nine-day trial. \"We can say what we want, while they can only say what political censorship allows.</p> <p>\"Maybe they think it wouldn't be wrong to try us for speaking against Putin and his system, but they can't say that because it's been forbidden,\" she said, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the revolutionary words \"No Pasaran\".</p> <p>Couching their case in the long plight of political prisoners in the country, the three women urged Russians to reject Putin's system and embrace freedom.</p> <p>Alyokhina, 24, compared the trial to the Soviet Union's persecution of Joseph Brodsky, when the young poet was charged with being a \"social parasite\", becoming a global cause celebre that highlighted the government's farcical control over culture.</p> <p>\"We are not guilty \u2013 the whole world is talking about it,\" Alyokhina said, hours after Madonna became the latest, and biggest, star to come to the women's defence.</p> <p>\"I am not scared of you,\" Alyokhina told the court. \"I'm not scared of lies and fiction, or the badly formed deception that is the verdict of this so-called court. Because my words will live, thanks to openness.</p> <p>\"When thousands of people will read and watch this, this freedom will grow with every caring person who listens to us in this country.\"</p> <p>Lawyers for Pussy Riot have been expecting a guilty verdict and three-year sentence, but said that was called into question following the judge's delay in issuing her decision. Lawyer Nikolai Polozov said growing international attention, including recent messages of support from the likes of Madonna and Yoko Ono, had had their effect. \"To take a quick decision under such pressure is very dangerous for the authorities, so they've taken a time out,\" he told the Guardian. \"No matter what the verdict is, we have won,\" he added.</p> <p>Each woman ended her closing statement to <a href=\"http://www.telly.com/AFGW1?fromtwitvid=1\" title=\"\">loud applause</a> from the Russian journalists sitting in the courtroom.</p>",

  "<p>Themed recitals have long been popular with singers and audiences. But baritone <a href=\"http://www.williamberger.com/\" title=\"\">William Berger</a> takes the unusual step, on his debut album, of attempting to forge a psychological narrative from the disparate songs that&#xa0;form his programme. Based on performances at the 2011 Lucerne festival and recorded in Edinburgh last February, Insomnia depicts a sleepless night in the life of a&#xa0;man separated from his mistress.</p> <p>The songs are grouped according to&#xa0;time. So we begin with Mozart's Abendempfindung at 19.30, then follow our protagonist as he contemplates the natural beauty of the night, before conflicting feelings begin to erode his calm. Schubert's Auf der Bruck finds him anxious and impatient at 23.30. At 1am, a burst of energy brings with it a group of serenades by Wolf and Faur\u00e9, though by 3am a mixture of regret and erotic fantasy creeps in with Sonnet, specially composed by <a href=\"http://www.raymondyiu.com/\" title=\"\">Raymond Yiu</a>, and Liszt's Oh! Quand Je Dors.</p> <p>Not all of it works. The stylistic range is, at times, too wide to convey psychological consistency. The underlying issue of&#xa0;whether the relationship is over is&#xa0;muddied by too many songs that suggest the definite presence or absence of a lover. You can't, however, fault Berger's singing. His tone is beautiful, his technique immaculate. He does extraordinary things with breath control in Oh! Quand Je Dors and Wolf's Um Mitternacht, and his sense of line is exceptional.None of the tracks disappoint, though his way with French song \u2013 sweepingly sensual rather than reined-in and delicate \u2013 is persuasive. Pianist <a href=\"http://www.askonasholt.co.uk/artists/accompanists/iain-burnside\" title=\"\">Iain Burnside</a> is wonderfully responsive to his shifts in mood and style. An idiosyncratic disc, but very fine.</p>",
  "<p>What do <a href=\"http://www.mmppa.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Melton Mowbray pork pies</a>, <a href=\"http://www.farmhousecheesemakers.com/\" title=\"\">West Country farmhouse cheddar</a>, Whitstable oysters, and Herefordshire cider have in common? Aside from the makings of a great picnic, they all have protected food names, enshrined in EU law.</p> <p>You've probably noticed an EU symbol on some favourite foods. A red and yellow one indicates a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO). This means a product must be made to a traditional recipe, in a certain geographical area, with ingredients from that area. A blue and yellow symbol indicates a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI), which must also be made in a specific region to its traditional recipe, but may include ingredients from further afield. Another mark, the Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) symbol, safeguards the recipe but doesn't specify where a product should be made. And if that's not enough acronyms, the French also have their own scheme, the Appelation D'Originee Contr\u00f4ll\u00e9e (AOC), which protects cheeses like Roquefort and Brie de Meaux from paler, less gloriously stinky imitations, and is best known for promoting the fizzy output of a certain region called <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/jul/23/champagne-sales-lose-their-sparkle\" title=\"\">Champagne</a>.</p> <p>Britain now has 48 foods with a PDO or PGI. They're dotted across the country, from <a href=\"http://www.jerseyroyals.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Jersey Royals</a> in the south to Orkney beef in the north. But we're still trailing our continental cousins. Italy currently has 244 PDOs and PGIs, France 191 and Spain 154.</p> <p>So how do you get a protected food name? It can be a long and winding road, paved with red tape. \"It took us 9\u00bd years to get the PGI,\" says Mark Muncey of the Cornish Pasty Association, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/13/rachel-cooke-cornish-pasty-european-commission\" title=\"\">awarded a PGI in March 2011</a>. But the Cornish pasty makers never considered giving up: \"People were ripping off the Cornish pasty around the country, using the name but not the standard.\" Now a Cornish pasty must be made in the county, using just beef, onions, swede, potatoes and seasoning. The pastry must be rough puff, with crimps on the side.</p> <p>Melton Mowbray pork pies took \"11 years\" to get their PGI, says Stephen Hallam of Melton Mowbray pork pie company Dickinson &amp; Morris. \"There were lots of questions from other pork pie makers. It all went to court when another manufacturer objected [to the PGI application], and we won the case.\"</p> <p>Cornish Pasties and Melton Mowbray pork pies were among the first to apply for protection after the EU scheme was established in 1993. These days the process is a little speedier, and there's more help for UK producers. Defra works with consultancy ADAS to advise producers on whether to go for a PDO, PGI or TSG, and guide them through the process.</p> <p>Why go through it at all? \"PGIs and PDOs guarantee authenticity to consumers and help preserve traditional recipes. We list our historic buildings, we ought to list our food products too,\" says Matthew O'Callaghan of the UK Protected Food Names Association. \"Being awarded PGI status is a fantastic coup as it secures a product's identity, gives it a strong brand image, and protects it from imitation,\" says Myrddin Davies, a producer of Welsh lamb, awarded a PGI in 2003. &#xa0;</p> <p>PGI and PDO products contribute \u00a31bn to the UK economy. And the effects on regional economies can be significant. \"The Melton Mowbray pork pie market is about \u00a350m. Stilton, made in the same area, is worth another \u00a350-\u00a360m, and tourism in the area another \u00a365m - significant numbers for a borough of 50,000 people,\" says Matthew O'Callaghan.</p> <p>It all sounds perfect \u2013 unless you're on the outside looking in. \"I believe in the PDO ideal but it's horribly mismanaged,\" says Joe Schneider of <a href=\"www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2007/dec/18/rhapsodyinblue\" title=\"\">Stichelton cheese</a>. Joe makes his cheese using raw milk, once the traditional Stilton-making method. But because the PDO for Stilton cheese stipulates pasteurised milk, he can't legally call the cheese Stilton. \"The PDO demonstrably excludes a product that is in some ways more traditional,\" says Schneider. \"Stichelton is a contentious issue,\" says Nigel White of the <a href=\"http://www.stiltoncheese.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Stilton Cheesemakers Association</a>. \"For our members, pasteurised milk is right for the safety of the product.\" Stichelton has written to Defra asking for the pasteurisation clause in Stilton's PDO to be changed.</p> <p>Inevitably, accusations of protectionism swarm around PDOs . \"We've been called a cartel,\" says Stephen Hallam. \"But we're not stopping anyone from making a pork pie, or even moving to the area and making a Melton Mowbray Pork Pie.\" \"PDOs are blatantly protectionism,\" says Nigel White. \"They protect the recipe and the producers who have been making it for a long period of time. But it's not a guarantee of success \u2013 foods still stand and fall on whether consumers like them.\"</p> <p>Over-zealous protectionism or an effective way of identifying delicious foods? What British grub would you like to see awarded a PDO or PGI?</p>",
  "<p>Gareth Goh has the sort of summer job most 16-year-olds could only dream of: piloting around a bumper-sized remote control car in front of 80,000 people, with the world's best athletic competition to keep you occupied during breaks.</p> <p>Goh's task, which admittedly is unpaid, is to be one of the Games volunteers controlling the quarter-scale electric Minis that whizz around the central area of the Olympic stadium, returning javelins, shots and discuses to competitors. While the days are long and the responsibility great \u2014 no one wants to be remembered as the volunteer whose car careered onto the track during a race \u2014 there is the bonus that the field events tend to pause during the noise of major running heats and finals.</p> <p>\"I was there for Super Saturday, and for the 100m final on the Sunday. We get the best view you can,\" said Goh, one of 10 Sutton grammar school pupils working inside the stadium. \"It's been pretty amazing. Some of my friends were a bit jealous at first, but we're trying to share out the job at the stadium so everyone gets to do it.\"</p> <p>If Goh is feeling happy with his lot, so is BMW, which owns the Mini marque and is one of the official sponsors of the Games. Marketing experts are agog at the way BMW's ad people have managed to get such a recognisable product \u2014 albeit a scaled-down one \u2014 inside the Olympic Stadium, supposedly a product placement-free zone.</p> <p>The International Olympic Committee's charter would seem to be quite clear, stating in rule 50 that \"commercial installations and advertising signs shall not be allowed in the stadia\". The IOC has passed the use of the cars as they carry no specific branding. Nonetheless, the IOC's television and marketing director, Timo Lumme, conceded at a press conference, that \"you can recognise it's a Mini\".</p> <p>If that wasn't enough, the \"mini Minis\", as they are inevitably called, have proved a hit with spectators and the media, giving BMW extra payback for their estimated \u00a340m deal with the 2012 Games. The coup is all the greater given the more hostile spectator reaction to some actions by primary sponsors, for example Visa's decision to bar the use of any other cards at Olympic venues while plastering kiosks with the unlikely-sounding slogan, \"Proud to accept only Visa\".</p> <p>Goh's involvement came last year when, spurred on by his father, who had already volunteered, he organised a group of fellow pupils to apply to be \"junior Games makers\". Before he arrived at the Olympic Park he had little idea of what his duties might involve: \"On our first day in the stadium one of the officials asked if we could nominate someone for a particular task. Because it had been my idea to get the team together, they picked me.\"</p> <p>He and the other remote-control operators had less than 15 minutes training to use the cars, he said: \"They're pretty straightforward \u2014 the controls are just forward and backwards, left and right. You're really just running them up and down the field. I've not had any mishaps yet, though someone else did run his Mini into an official. They didn't seem to mind too much.</p> <p>\"The only problem can sometimes be remembering which is yours, because they look identical. A couple of times I've wondered why mine isn't moving and realised I'm looking at the wrong one \u2014 you need to concentrate quite hard.\"</p> <p>It's not the only significant event for Goh this summer: on 23 August his GCSE results arrive. He said: \"At least this has helped to keep my mind off it.\"</p>",

  "<p>When WC Fields was dying of hard-earned cirrhosis of the liver, he would turn to the Bible. When asked why, he explained: \"I'm looking for loopholes.\" If the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/20/conservative-liberal-democrat-coalition-agreement-analysis\" title=\"\">coalition agreement</a> is the Bible for the coalition government, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/07/coalition-government-danger-collapse\" title=\"\">the two parties have started to treat it as WC Fields did</a>. Perhaps, like Fields, at least one of the government parties never really believed in it in the first place.</p> <p>Let us recall happier times. In his keynote speech on 19 May 2010 about the government's constitutional reform agenda, Nick Clegg promised there would be a big package of reform \u2026</p> <blockquote> \"Did you know we've been talking about reforming the House of Lords for over 150 years? It's one of the areas where all the parties agree. The time for talk is over. This government will replace the House of Lords with an elected second chamber \u2026 where members are elected by a proportional voting system. There will be a committee charged specifically with making this happen \u2026 But make no mistake: that committee will not be yet another government talking shop. This will be a dedicated group devoted to kick-starting real reform.\" </blockquote> <p>There were no howls of outrage at the time from Conservative backbenchers. The principle of Lords reform was indeed in the manifestos of all three main parties. Nobody who stood on a <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/~/media/Files/Activist%20Centre/Press%20and%20Policy/Manifestos/Manifesto2010\" title=\"\">manifesto</a> containing the wording \u2026</p> <blockquote> \"We will work to build a consensus for a mainly elected second chamber to replace the current House of Lords, recognising that an efficient and effective second chamber should play an important role in our democracy and requires both legitimacy and public confidence\" </blockquote> <p>\u2026 has any business claiming they were not signed up to reforming the House of Lords. The text of the coalition agreement <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/coalition_programme_for_government.pdf\" title=\"\">puts it as follows</a>:</p> <blockquote> \"We will establish a committee to bring forward proposals for a wholly or mainly elected upper chamber on the basis of proportional representation \u2026 It is likely that this will advocate single long terms of office.\" </blockquote> <p>The coalition agreement clearly gives the government fair wind to reform the Lords. This is in contrast with the \"reforms\" to the NHS. The coalition agreement promised:</p> <blockquote> \"We will stop the top-down re-organisations of the NHS that have got in the way of patient care. We are committed to reducing duplication and the resources spent on administration, and diverting these resources back to frontline care.\" </blockquote> <p>The coalition agreement promised directly elected primary care trusts, a Liberal Democrat project which could be seen as part of political reform as well as health. But the government introduced a massive re-organisation and abolished PCTs. The Lib Dems voted for it anyway.</p> <p>After the AV referendum, Cameron offered Clegg a choice of compensation \u2013 either dropping the NHS bill or proceeding with Lords reform. It is arguable that House of Lords reform was quid pro quo for letting the Conservatives have their way on the NHS. The Lib Dems can feel that they were good coalition soldiers for supporting the NHS bill despite going against part of the agreement. Specifically, the Clegg-Cameron conversation suggests that supporting the NHS bill was down-payment for Conservative support on the Lords.</p> <p>Stopping boundary changes is therefore a fair sanction. It is a bit rich for Conservative MPs who were defending unelected Lords to suddenly wax indignant about some relatively small discrepancies in constituency size. In mutilating the coalition programme they were poking the Lib Dems with a stick, and it is not unreasonable for the Lib Dems to poke back. That's politics. If you want loyalty, get a dog.</p> <p>A more elevated argument is made by Lord Rennard, who points out that an elected Lords would offer a better check on the executive and that a smaller Commons would be more dominated by the payroll vote. The coalition regarded reduction of the power of the executive over parliament as a philosophical plank of its agenda. The combination of an appointed Lords and fewer MPs would increase executive dominance. As Nick Clegg put it on 19 May 2010:</p> <blockquote> \"Executive authority [has been] consistently increased by successive administrations to the point that we now have a neutered parliament and government that enjoys almost untrammelled control \u2013 over precisely the people who are meant to keep it in check.\" </blockquote> <p>I have written elsewhere in opposition to what has become the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 (see <a href=\"http://www.democraticaudit.com/publications/\" title=\"\">Democratic Audit papers</a>). However, more evidence has become available since February 2011 including the convoluted nature of many of the proposed constituencies, <a href=\"http://ec-search01.squiz.co.uk/search/click.cgi?rank=1&amp;collection=electoral-commission&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.electoralcommission.org.uk%2F__data%2Fassets%2Fpdf_file%2F0007%2F145366%2FGreat-Britains-electoral-registers-2011.pdf&amp;index_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.electoralcommission.org.uk%2F__data%2Fassets%2Fpdf_file%2F0007%2F145366%2FGreat-Britains-electoral-registers-2011.pdf&amp;auth=CamSNzAp7AyyqyDra7h7DQ&amp;query=&amp;profile=_default\" title=\"\">electoral commission research</a> that reveals the scale and uneven dimensions of incompleteness and inaccuracy of the electoral register; evidence from data-matching pilots that individual electoral registration may be significantly more difficult than the government envisaged, and therefore more likely to introduce distortions to the electoral registers and therefore to boundaries drawn on that basis.</p> <p>The coalition agreement reads:</p> <blockquote> \"We will bring forward a referendum bill on electoral reform, which includes provision for the introduction of the alternative vote in the event of a positive result in the referendum, as well as for the creation of fewer and more equal sized constituencies.\" </blockquote> <p>The new rules have been legislated, but there is nothing specific in the agreement obliging the Lib Dems to vote for the implementation order. This argument is no less tenable than some Conservatives' attempts to argue that they were not committed to Lords reform. Like WC Fields, the coalition partners have started looking for loopholes.</p>",
  "<p>Some came in sorrow, some in solidarity. Many carried a niggling sense of shame.</p> <p>It was not that the people of Oak Creek bore responsibility for the tragedy of a white supremacist shooting dead six worshippers in a Sikh temple on Sunday. But some residents turning out at Tuesday evening's candlelit vigil for the victims recognised that they knew too little about the Sikhs living, and dying, in their midst.</p> <p>\"We didn't know about them,\" said Loren Bauer, a retired machinist. \"We see them but we don't pay much attention. A lot of them drive cabs and have gas stations and convenience stores. The only thing I ever heard about them was that a lot of people thought they were Muslims after 9/11.\"</p> <p>Teri Pelzek, too, had barely heard of Sikhs. \"I knew nothing about them at all. I don't think a lot of people did. When we don't know about somebody's religion we assume the worst,\" she said.</p> <p>Yet the rapid learning curve since the massacre delivered up the unexpected. Some at the vigil were struck by the Sikh community's willingness to forgive the man who committed murder in their temple, who was himself shot dead by the police, and to emphasise peace over vengeance. The town's police chief, John Edwards, was among them.</p> <p>\"In 28 years of law enforcement, I have seen a lot of hate. I have seen a lot of revenge. I've seen a lot of anger. What I saw, particularly from the Sikh community this week was compassion, concern, support,\" he told the vigil standing in front a row of people holding signs that spelled out: practice peace. \"What I didn't see was hate. I did not see revenge. I didn't see any of that. And in law enforcement that's unusual to not see that reaction to something like this. I want you all to understand how unique that is.\"</p> <p>Pelzek said that in a country so often unforgiving and vengeful it was startling to see the Sikh response to the tragedy. \"It surprised everyone when they were victims of someone so full of hatred. Because of their reaction, saying they'd like to forgive and move on, I think that's quite the attitude to hear after what just happened,\" she said.</p> <p>The lesson, spelled out by Oak Creek's mayor, Steve Saffidi, was that it shouldn't have taken a tragedy for Sikhs, or anyone else, to find acceptance. <br>\"Our healing process begins tonight when we come together, joining hands, sharing customs, meeting each other, some for the first time - many people that we have probably not met before. That is a good thing for our community,\" he said.</p> <p>The theme resonated through the evening. Wisconsin's governor, Scott Walker, said the legacy of the killings should be for people to pay a little bit more attention to their fellow citizens, their neighbours and their friends.</p> <p>The vigil was arranged to follow National Night Out where people in towns across the US gather one evening a year to combat crime and promote community spirit. In Oak Creek they cancelled the closing fireworks out of respect for the dead but not the cheerleaders so that groups of Sikhs made their way to the neighbouring park for the vigil to the sound of young women yelping as they waved their pom poms to dance music.</p> <p>In time, hundreds of people drifted across to don symbolic white turbans and hold candles.</p> <p>The murdered victims were honoured individually with short accounts of how each came to be in the US and their lives in Oak Creek. Four of them were Indian citizens.</p> <p><strong>Satwant Kaleka,</strong> 65, is the victim most often talked about in the wider community because, the vigil was told, he \"died defending the temple he built attempting to fend off a gunman who attacked worshippers on Sunday\". The FBI told Kaleka's family that he tried to stop the killer with a knife. He was mortally wounded but his attempt bought time for other people to get away. HIs wife, Satpal, was hiding in a closet during the massacre. Kaleka came to the US in 1980 with only $100 but he built a successful business.</p> <p><strong>Paramjit Kaur,</strong> 41, was the only woman killed. The audience heard her described as \"selfless\" in putting her 18- and 20-year-old sons first, and a great value on education. She arrived with her husband, Inder, from the Punjab region eight years ago and worked at a medical instruments company. </p> <p><strong>Suveg Singh</strong> was, at 84, the oldest victim. He was a farmer who moved to the US with his wife only eight years ago in order to live with his sons. Singh was described as devout, \"always happy\" and a man willing to engage with anyone.</p> <p><strong>Sita Singh</strong>, 41, was a priest at the temple born in India who moved to New York and then arrived in Oak Creek earlier this year. The vigil heard that he was a \"top and dedicated man who was very easy to talk to\". He is survived by his wife and four children. He led morning services at about 5am.</p> <p><strong>Ranjit Singh</strong>, 49, was Sita's Singh's brother and a former priest at the temple. More recently he played drums during prayer services. He left India 15 years ago and has not seen his son, who was just seven months old back then, in that time. Singh and the boy were to be reunited during a visit to Delhi in November. His body is expected to be returned to India for burial along with his brother.</p> <p><strong>Prakash Singh</strong>, brought his wife and two children, ages 11 and 12, family to the US from India only six weeks ago after seven years apart. Singh was a priest and received his permanent resident card at the beginning of the year after living in the US for nine years.</p> <p>Amardeep Singh, of the Sikh Coalition, thanked Oak Creek's citizens for turning out in solidarity. It was a view echoed by many of the Sikhs present who, until the temple tragedy, felt less than fully accepted not least because they were often mistaken for Muslims with the consequences that carries since 9/11.</p> <p>But Singh's repeated on emphasis on Sikhs as Americans \u2013 \"I would like to thank every single person who is here for being here on this night out and wrapping your arms around your fellow Americans upon our time of grief\" \u2013 suggested he believes there is still work to be done.</p>",
  "<p>I hope you've got a few minutes because I think what we need is an appraisal. Since I first began blathering on about age, size and all things in between, we seem to have turned a bit of a corner. Lanvin have upended things for their autumn/winter collection and created <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/2012/jul/27/lanvin-fashion-ads-non-professional-models\" title=\"\">a series of advertisements</a> featuring, for want of a better word, \"real\" people. No doubt they'll all be whip thin, or slim at the very least, but it's still progress. Or it is if other fashion houses follow the lead and do it too. It will look even more like progress if at least one fashion house does it every season. But of course we've been here before \u2013 Mark Fast created a bit of a stir by using, again for want of a better word, \"plus size\" models and we all got very excited. And then what\u2026? Exactly.</p> <p>But Dolce &amp; Gabbana have been doing it on and off for some time, shooting family groups and Dolce &amp; Gabbana-ing everyone from baby to great-granny in a little Italian fabulousness. They've even shot a campaign with Madonna. Not that Madonna's your average 50-something woman but let's not be mean, that's still a middle-aged woman up there on that billboard with, I hope, minimal photo-shopping.</p> <p>There's been progress elsewhere, too. Those deeply annoying L'Oreal ads for anti-aging products featuring a supernaturally smooth-skinned Rachel Weisz were <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/feb/01/loreal-advert-rachel-weisz-banned\" title=\"\">banned because they were 'misleading'</a>. Could it be that the tide is at last beginning to turn? After saying I didn't think I'd see it in my lifetime, are we finally on the cusp of a more enlightened advertising age? Will we at last be able to see clothes for our age group on actual women instead of 17-year-old models? I'm trying hard to set aside my natural cynicism here and be hopeful.</p> <p>What set me off on this train of thought was seeing the news about Lanvin shortly after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/fashion-blog/2012/jul/18/older-french-women-style\" title=\"\">my visit to France</a> and shortly before clapping eyes on a framed vintage advert in my dentist's waiting room. The ad was from a 1950s health drive to get everyone to look after their teeth and it said: \"Our looks are improved by sound and healthy teeth. Good looks in turn give confidence and lead to success in life.\" The picture was of a beaming and immaculately groomed young woman. Yes, it's funny but it also made me feel a little bit depressed and quite a lot angry. I was born in the 1950s and what this ad said to me was that my generation has been conditioned to believe this sort of rot from the moment we could walk and talk. It doesn't even grace the statement with a 'could' or a 'maybe'. No, my generation was sent out into the world believing that all we had to do was look pretty and everything we'd ever wanted would be laid at our feet. Small wonder then that now we're all menopausal and losing what looks we might have had we're also thinking that we're all washed up, irrelevant and invisible. Thank goodness the 60s intervened and helped to undo at least some of the damage, but these attitudes drilled in early in life have an awful tendency to hang around like moths in a woollen blanket.</p> <p>So here's my point: it's the attitude thing again. What I noticed in France was a fundamental difference in the approach to shopping both by buyer and seller. Even in a street market the stallholder will likely give you an appraising look, size you on the spot and produce exactly the right thing in the right colour. This happens in Paris and all over the place because shopping is generally considered one of life's pleasures, to be enjoyed by all. Try the same thing in the UK (and I did for research purposes) and you'll be met with a languid sigh of indifference if you're lucky and flint-faced hostility if you're not. It's hardly surprising that we enter shops with a guilty look and defeat oozing from every pore. I mean, what possible right could Invisible Women in the UK have to enter a shop and expect good service or to be helped to find something that will make us look good? It's a bit short-sighted, isn't it, when middle-aged women are the ones with disposable income and a need to buy? Mark my words, it'll come back and bite them on the bum. I hope we're shaping up for a big Pretty Woman moment \u2013 you know, the bit where Julia Roberts goes back into the store that wouldn't serve her and says <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqnuN2oprw&amp;feature=related\" title=\"\">\"Big mistake\u2026 HUGE.\"</a></p>",
  "<p>Walking just a mile from my apartment to my parent's house in Brooklyn, New York on Monday evening, I witnessed three bicyclists riding in an alarmingly dangerous manner: one nearly ran me over as he turned on a red light while I crossed a street; one was going the wrong way on Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn's busiest street; and one forced me to wait to cross on a green light because he ran a red without even slowing down, much less stopping. By the time I was safely indoors, I had decided that New York City ought to start much more aggressively enforcing the traffic laws on bicycles. </p> <p>So, imagine my surprise when I got to my parents house, opened the New York Times Sunday Review, and saw that Randy Cohen, The New York Times Magazine's erstwhile \"ethicist\", had written <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/opinion/sunday/if-kant-were-a-new-york-cyclist.html\">an op-ed in favor of these irresponsible behaviors</a>. To be sure, Cohen did not endorse each of the foolish choices, but his distinctions between the ones he proudly engages in and all others are pure sophistry. Cohen writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I routinely run red lights, and so do you. I flout the law when I'm on my bike; you do it when you are on foot, at least if you are like most New Yorkers. My behavior vexes pedestrians, drivers and even some of my fellow cyclists \u2026</p> <p>\"But although it is illegal, I believe it is ethical \u2026 I roll through a red light if and only if no pedestrian is in the crosswalk and no car is in the intersection \u2013 that is, if it will not endanger myself or anybody else. To put it another way, I treat red lights and stop signs as if they were yield signs. A fundamental concern of ethics is the effect of our actions on others. My actions harm no one. This moral reasoning may not sway the police officer writing me a ticket, but it would pass the test of Kant's categorical imperative: I think all cyclists could \u2013 and should \u2013 ride like me.</p> <p>\"I am not anarchic; I heed most traffic laws. I do not ride on the sidewalk (OK, except for the final 25ft between the curb cut and my front door, and then with caution). I do not salmon \u2013 ie, ride against traffic.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Cohen's assertions rest on several false premises. The first is that only a physical injury to another person constitutes harming him or her. But Cohen himself admits that \"My behavior vexes pedestrians, drivers and even some of my fellow cyclists.\" Why is vexing someone not harming him? If you go around the city causing aggravation to your fellow citizens \u2013 whether by blasting loud music, disobeying traffic laws, littering, or whatever \u2013 you <em>are</em> causing harm to other individuals and to society as a whole. Whether or not you are behaving unethically, you are certainly behaving selfishly. </p> <p>And when a bicyclist nearly hits me, as they frequently do, I feel more than just vexed: I feel momentarily scared. Obviously, accidents are worse than near-accidents, but shouldn't bicyclists respect pedestrians enough not to frighten them by almost running them over?</p> <p>Second, Cohen makes totally meaningless distinctions and pretends that he is somehow limiting himself to only the ethical violations of the law and infringements on other people's space. Why is running a red light OK, but riding on the sidewalk or against traffic a step too far? Riding on the sidewalk is the same as running a red: you are entering the pedestrian's legal space on a fast-moving, heavy metal object. </p> <p>Suppose Cohen's personal rules do actually avoid harming anyone else. Why does he think that he has the right to decide which laws he follows and which he doesn't? Anyone can justify breaking the law in this way. How does Cohen know that every bicyclist who takes his advice will be as careful as he is to make sure no pedestrians are coming?</p> <p>Contrary to Cohen's assertion, he is indeed behaving anarchically \u2013 because the only natural endpoint of letting individuals decide which laws they will follow, and under what circumstances, <em>is</em> anarchy. </p> <p>Finally, Cohen argues that pedestrians jaywalking is just as dangerous, possibly even more so, as a biker running a red light. This is self-evidently absurd. To state the obvious, pedestrians do not move as quickly, and their bodies are not as hard, as bicycles. Also, isn't \"two wrongs making a right\" one of the most well-known of logical fallacies? If pedestrians are jaywalking right in front of bicyclists and causing collisions, or near collisions, they shouldn't be, and the police should ticket them, as well. </p> <p>Some bicyclists, such as Cohen, feel that \u2013 because biking is better for the environment than driving \u2013 they enjoy a superior moral status to everyone else and they are therefore entitled to flout traffic laws. (Cohen makes this argument by implication, with an extended riff on how driving is unethical because of its negative externalities such as pollution.) This is why one can defend such antisocial behavior in the New York Times. Can you imagine the Times publishing a defense of selectively violating laws against littering or playing loud music late at night? Of course not \u2013 because in any other realm vexing your neighbors by breaking the law is understood to be rude and unacceptable. </p> <p>What these self-righteous bikers fail to recognize is that New York is filled with fellow non-drivers who are seriously threatened by their behavior. It is, of course, better for the environment, public health and livable streets if more people bike and fewer drive. Public policies promoting biking instead of driving, such as creating bike lanes, are therefore commendable. But public support for these policies is undermined by bikers who threaten pedestrians, and even come up with ridiculous justifications, such as Cohen's, for doing so.</p> <p>If Cohen really wants to promote biking, he should obey the law, and urge his fellow riders to do the same.</p>",

  "<p>Olympic organisers may not be seeing anywhere near their ambition of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/bike-blog/2012/jan/19/olympics-fans-bikes\" title=\"\">4,400 bikeborne visitors a day</a>, but plenty of people are cycling around the Olympic Park. So who are these cyclists, and how do they feel about cycling in London?</p> <p>The Dutch are, as expected, out in force, and during the Olympics get extra bike safety points with the neon orange outfits many supporters wear. The first cycling tourists I met were riding very attractive town bikes provided by <a href=\"http://www.matbase.com/index.php?content=1109\" title=\"\">OV-Fiets</a>, a scheme owned by the Dutch Railways that rents out bikes by the day from train stations in the Netherlands.</p> <p>Lawyer Erik Mientjes, 27, arrived on Monday with his friends Remco Vroegop and Merijn van der Klooster. They were looking forward to the women's hockey semi-finals tonight \u2013 although not as much as they might have been if they'd had tickets to the right semi-final. They had Argentina v Great Britain instead of Netherlands v New Zealand. Like other Dutch visitors, they were disappointed by the lack of proper bike lanes. Wendy, a Dutch tourist from Alphen aan den Rijn, declared the roads in London were \"pretty dangerous\".</p> <blockquote> \"There are cycle paths here but they are narrow and they sometimes just stop.\" </blockquote> <p>Rob Marks moved to London from South Africa earlier this year. A Games volunteer, he loves cycling in London, but is aware of the dangers.</p> <blockquote> \"I saw a guy get knocked off his bike in Bow last night because a driver decided to turn straight across a cycle superhighway without signalling. But that said, the cycle superhighway are awesome, we need more of them, although the roundabout where CS2 on Stratford high street meets the dual carriageway is flipping dangerous - it was designed for cars and then had a bike lane added afterwards.\" </blockquote> <p>Chris McMurran, from Ardrossan in Ayrshire, had come down on a whim and put his bike on the train to avoid the traffic.</p> <blockquote> \"At home I'd usually have music playing, but there's not a chance here. I know there are some cycle lanes but there's a lot of taxis and buses driving in them \u2013 everyone's in a hurry. There should be more routes with complete separation.\" </blockquote> <p>Bel\u00e9n, Rub\u00e9n and Oalla from Madrid borrowed bikes from a friend in London, despite finding the fact that bikes share a lane with buses intimidating. They had to cycle because of the cost.</p> <blockquote> \"The underground here is four times as expensive as it is in Madrid \u2013 we're having a crisis in Spain, we can't afford to go by tube when we're here.\" </blockquote> <p>Yuko Motoyama also cited the cost of public transport as the reason for cycling while here, and was a big fan of the London cycle hire scheme, which doesn't have an equivalent in her native Tokyo. She was surprised at how many people wear helmets in London.</p> <blockquote> \"Usually Japanese people don't wear them, they're seen as uncool.\" </blockquote> <p>It's not just spectators that are cycling to the Games. When I met Daniel Schlang, part of Germany's first ever Olympic BMX team, he was riding down Stratford high street. Despite the fact that he's entitled to be driven around in the Games lanes, the 21-year-old athlete had forsaken his chauffeur driven car for his BMX on his way to a training session before the start of the competition today. It was all about speed and convenience for Schlang, from Cottbus, a small town near Berlin.</p> <blockquote> \"It's a little bit faster because there's a lot of traffic. The Olympic lanes are brilliant but I ride every day so I think I'm faster on the bike.\" </blockquote> <p>Schlang wasn't the only one choosing a bike over official Games transportation. Bori Csics\u00e1k, who had come over from Hungary to work in the park, bought a bike off the internet and was using it instead of the bus laid on by the organisers to get back to her lodgings. However, she was riding on the pavement down the high street.</p> <blockquote> \"I don't have the courage to ride on the road here, the traffic is scary.\" </blockquote> <p>Stopping in the bike park at the Greenway transport hub I got a free bike check from Anabel Sanchez. If only there were more free bike parks like this in London: secure, off the pavement and manned by several staff round the clock. Sanchez is pleased about the work she's doing.</p> <blockquote> \"There's not many bike shops in the area so it's nice that the Olympics gives some service to the locals. If you want to invite them to come by bike, you have to offer them support.\" </blockquote> <p>She mentions that one complaint she's heard a lot is that the bike parks are a long way from the venues \u2013 \"cyclists like to park right in front of where they're going\".</p> <p>David Hutchinson, a games maker from Norwich volunteering at the aquatics centre, agrees.</p> <blockquote> \"I wasn't impressed, being a volunteer and giving up all my time, that they didn't provide any cycle parking any nearer the venues \u2013 I have a half hour walk from here to the aquatics centre.\" </blockquote> <p>He says he feels safer in London, which has more bike lanes than Norwich, but is more wary of the drivers \u2013 \"they do come a bit close to you, and they're less considerate.\"</p> <p>Lemar Lewis, working for UPS in the park, had just taken up cycling for the Olympics.</p> <blockquote> \"Everyone's on the get-fit programme, plus it's quicker to my house.\" </blockquote> <p>It takes him 15 minutes to cycle to work, compared to 45 minutes by public transport. I ask him if he'll keep up the cycling after the Olympics:</p> <blockquote> \"Most definitely. I think it's the best way to get around London. They should put in a lot more bike lanes though \u2013 we need to start making some sacrifices. Oxford Street should be a no-car zone.\" </blockquote> <p>Hopefully his experience will be one that a lot of people have had over the past weeks, and his view echoes what I heard all day: we desperately need to improve conditions, but cycling is still the only way to get around London.</p>",
  "<p>When you consider it's a ridiculously common act that sustains industries, it's not surprising that there are many different ways to masturbate. This is true for men at least; I can't speak from any informed perspective, but I imagine it's the same for women too. I'm not naive enough to think Ann Summers profits from selling elaborate cake-mix stirrers. But by necessity, assume I'm speaking from the male perspective from this point on.</p> <p>These masturbation techniques are typically passed around by teenage boys in the midst of the <a href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/life/human-biology/male-puberty4.htm\">hormonal storms of puberty</a>, like some sort of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics\">memetic</a> contraband. Some of these techniques can be quite elaborate and far-fetched, which can result in someone ending up in, at best, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI5ZxZ-fq4A\">a stand-up routine</a>; at worst, A&amp;E. </p> <p>One such technique is \"<a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=the%20stranger\">the stranger</a>\", which is mentioned regularly in sitcoms. It involves the self-indulger making their arm go numb, then using said numbed limb to masturbate with. With no feeling in the arm, it supposedly feels like someone else is doing it.</p> <p>I've honestly never tried this, and don't know anyone who has (that they'll admit). It seems ridiculous though, for several reasons. </p> <p>Firstly, the lack of feeling in your arm is due to compressing nerves and blood vessels, <a href=\"http://health.howstuffworks.com/human-body/parts/question552.htm\">scrambling nerve signals and blood supply to said nerves</a>. I've had a numb arm before (for unrelated reasons) and I can envisage many logistical problems with trying to use it for such an act. Firstly, it's a weird, uncomfortable sensation (what with the <a href=\"http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-thermoreceptors.htm\">heat</a>/<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10965/\">pain</a> conducting nerves being the first to recover, hence the prickly, burning sensation that can be experienced). I can't imagine maintaining arousal in such a state, but maybe that's just me?</p> <p>Secondly, when I have a numb limb, I can't do much with it. What with nerve signals being scrambled, fine motor control and <a href=\"http://www.iadms.org/associations/2991/files/info/proprioception.pdf\">proprioception</a> (awareness of where your body is and what it's doing) are reduced. Self manipulation must be a tricky prospect when your arm has lost all feeling. </p> <p>You know what would also be hard to manipulate? Belt buckles, buttons and the like. These things you have to deal with at some point during the masturbation process. The obvious solution would be to remove your garments before numbing your arm, but this would add an extra hazard to getting caught; if someone enters unannounced and catches you masturbating, sure it's embarrassing, but it's not something that needs explaining. But if said person were to find you naked from the waist down and sitting on your hand, that's a scenario that will need some elaborating.</p> <p>And lastly, the reason I think this method wouldn't work (if there's anyone left who believes I haven't tried it given how much I've talked about it), is that I'm not that gullible. Just because my arm is numb doesn't mean I would assume it's someone else's. The impulses controlling it are still coming from my own brain, and that would surely ruin the illusion. There may be ways round this. Perhaps you could give yourself <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002839329190081I\">alien hand syndrome</a>, and hope your now-independent limb feels frisky at the required time. But deliberately severing your <a href=\"http://biology.about.com/od/anatomy/p/corpus-callosum.htm\">corpus callosum</a> seems like an extreme length to go to for momentary self-gratification. </p> <p>And even if you were able to convince yourself that your limb is not your own, that doesn't mean your senses stop functioning. You're then in a situation where your genitals are being manipulated by an undetectable presence, like an overly friendly ghost. And when I think of friendly ghosts, I immediately think of<a href=\"http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSB2DsvKo0hwqtXiEB-7mmqJ7aZ_sRP7bAonKva8sWLwrWnApOhUnyztuEG\"> Casper</a>. And if there's anyone you shouldn't think about while masturbating, it's Casper, a deceased child. What would that be classed as, pedonecrophilia? Even the most extreme sexual deviant must draw the line somewhere, surely?</p> <p>But despite all these logistical and biological barriers, \"the stranger\" is well known, so presumably enough people have enjoyed doing it, or at least liked the idea of it, for it to endure. Which just goes to show that you can't tell people what they find arousing. </p> <p>The subject of what is \"acceptably\" sexually stimulating or not has been raised in several ways of late, perhaps most obviously by the baffling success of the book <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/jul/06/why-women-love-fifty-shades-grey\">Fifty Shades of Grey</a>, which is, according to many reviews, a dreadfully written book made successful by virtue of being \"erotic\" and featuring \"mainstream\" (i.e. unrealistic) S&amp;M. It is, as my female relatives inform me, \"a dirty book\". </p> <p>But however purists/critics may complain and object to its portrayal of women, relationships, S&amp;M etc., it seems quite obvious that significant numbers of people find it \"stimulating\", as it's supposedly all about the sex scenes, and has sold millions of copies. The only other explanation is that vast numbers of people are aroused by bad writing, which I hope isn't the case, as it would mean this blog would need an 18 certificate at the very least.</p> <p>The more worrying aspects of \"acceptable arousal\" can be seen in the latest <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23porntrial\">porn trial</a>, where the Crown Prosecution Service are <a href=\"http://obscenitylawyer.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/porn-trial-this-time-its-extreme.html\">prosecuting a man for possessing images of an arguably \"extreme\" sex act that is not illegal</a>. The case is a result of government attempts to <a href=\"http://jackofkent.com/2012/08/what-is-extreme-pornography/\">prohibit extreme pornography</a>.</p> <p>Whatever you think of the acts being performed by those involved, no law has been broken apart from, allegedly, that of supposedly witnessing said acts, which are supposedly \"grossly offensive, disgusting or of an obscene character\". These all strike me as largely subjective measures when it comes to sex, and that's a worrying basis on which to base a law which applies to everyone. But whatever the ins-and-outs (fnarr!) of the legislation, it can easily be interpreted as an attempt by those in authority to declare that being aroused by certain things is wrong.</p> <p>But this is a ridiculous concept. Attempting to control what people are aroused by in this day and age is like trying to deflect an asteroid using the force of your own urine stream; if you're even in a position to attempt it, you've got no chance of succeeding, you're just going to end up looking ridiculous. People are incredibly complex psychological creatures, and sex is one hell of a motivator. The drive toward sex underpins so much of what we do in our adult lives, and is a <a href=\"http://psychology.about.com/od/theoriesofpersonality/ss/psychosexualdev.htm\">cornerstone of our psychological make-up, according to some</a>. </p> <p>But maybe it's rash to say you can't control what people are aroused by. Studies of sexual and so-called \"deviant\" behaviours<a href=\"http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1wc177zt#page-2\"> go back decades</a>, with a lot of focus on how conditioning can affect them. In <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1966-11075-001\">1966, Rachman</a> demonstrated inducing a sexual fetish in humans, by showing male volunteers pictures of female boots which were immediately followed by images of sexually arousing naked women. The subjects then experienced arousal when shown the boots alone. Essentially, they were given a shoe fetish in the name of science. Science is generous like that.</p> <p>But it's not just a simple case of \"X + sexy lady = X fetish\"; <a href=\"http://psychology.about.com/od/behavioralpsychology/a/classcond.htm\">conditioning</a> is more complex, humans exponentially more so. The boots were also described as a \"neutral stimulus\", but is that the case? The 60s are often described as a time of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_revolution_in_1960s_United_States\">sexual revolution</a>, and sexy women in boots weren't exactly an <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/birdofthegalaxy/4364415450/\">alien concept</a>. Is it possible the subjects already had a boots-sex association that the experiment simply enhanced? </p> <p>And obviously it would be naive to suggest that simply showing a human some inert object coupled with something sexually stimulating means they automatically develop a sexual fetish for that object. If that were the case, these days we'd see thousands of people lusting over computer screens. And that's ridiculous \u2026 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2011/mar/24/ipad-2-apple-uk-queues-start\">right? </a></p> <p>Humans don't get to choose what they're sexually aroused by, despite what some fundamentalists may insist. How one person's development progresses to sexual maturity is impossible to predict with any accuracy, and is usually far beyond their control. Most people are seemingly hard-wired to be attracted to and sexually aroused by other humans in some form, although even that is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16552173\">not guaranteed</a>. But the number of things that can shape a human's sexual preferences, from quirks of internal biology to one-off external experiences, is ridiculously vast. </p> <p>To clarify, this isn't an argument in favour of all sexual activities being allowed at all times, or a defence of damaging sexually motivated action. Obviously there are some desires that are rightly not allowed as they cause harm to unwilling people. Just because you have a desire doesn't mean you should be allowed to act on it, for the same reason someone desiring a new TV doesn't mean they should be allowed to steal mine. But there's a difference between not acting on an impulse and not having it at all, and I feel it's an important distinction that's often overlooked</p> <p>There's no universal baseline for acceptable sexual desire that I've encountered. One person's deviant behaviour is another's mundane activity. I'd wager there's no sexual activity that you could name that doesn't have someone who strongly objects to it. The commonly cited rule of thumb is \"as long as nobody gets hurt\", but even that is confusing when it comes to sex. What with it being an undeniably physical and anatomically invasive process, it obviously depends on what you mean by \"hurt\". And surely the \"nobody gets hurt\" rule misses the point of S&amp;M altogether? But this is still a perfectly legal activity that consenting adults regularly indulge in.</p> <p>The complexity of the human psyche and the pervasiveness of sex, both in our own heads and society in general, mean the spectrum of human sexual desires is far too varied and complex to be effectively regulated. And with the exception of laws that clearly prevent genuine harm coming to innocent people, why would you need to? Appealing to some ill-defined moral high ground is a spurious argument when you're trying to control people's private activities. Trying to restrict by law an act between consenting adults on the grounds that people who don't have to watch it would find it obscene isn't logical. </p> <p>But then, this is a country where you're allowed to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/advice/factfile_az/age_of_consent\">actually have sex</a> before you can <a href=\"http://www.bbfc.co.uk/classification/guidelines/18-2/\">look at it.</a> It's a bit much to insist that teenagers practise safe sex if they have to be blindfolded the whole time too.</p> <p>In conclusion, human sexuality is a far more complex thing than any legislation can hope to accurately reflect. No doubt there are many things I've overlooked in this piece, or things that you'd say are flat out wrong. That's your prerogative. But that's the point: if the laws of society can't hope to effectively encompass the complexity of sexuality, I've got no chance of doing so in a single blog post.</p> <p>And yes, this whole article was a result of me not wanting to waste the tortured pun/link-bait title once I'd thought of it.</p> <p><em>Dean Burnett doesn't usually talk about other people's sexual preferences this much, as his Twitter account hopefully demonstrates: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garwboy\">@garwboy</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Earlier this year Codemasters announced that, for the foreseeable future, it was going to concentrate exclusively on making racing games \u2013 which instantly piqued the interest of the car-obsessed sector of the gaming community and launched a specific topic of debate. In that case, the speculation went, the Leamington-based company will surely bring us new versions of all its four-wheeled franchises, so can we expect a new version of Grid?</p> <p>Now, it can be confirmed that Grid 2 is under development. It will arrive in summer 2013, on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 \u2013 and from what we have seen and played, should have what it takes to build considerably on the franchise's cult-classic reputation.</p> <p>Grid evolved from Codemasters' most simulation-oriented racing franchise, TOCA Race Driver (TOCA being the outfit that oversees the British Touring Car Championship). Race fans will be aware that the BTCC offers the most bruising, full-contact four-wheeled racing that anyone could crave, and Grid 2's predecessors reflected that, although the BTCC wasn't their main focus.</p> <p>You had to participate in a number of very different formulae, of which the likes of Formula Ford 2000, in which it was virtually impossible to corner without initiating a four-wheel drift, stood out. 2008's Grid dropped the official licence and concentrated on gritty, down-and-dirty racing across street and custom-built circuits, mostly in super-powerful rear-wheel-drive cars.</p> <p>Grid's standout aspect was the way in which it provided an emphatic antidote to the antiseptic, squeaky-clean nature of rivals such as the car-damage-averse Gran Turismo and particularly Microsoft's Forza. Everything in it looked a bit grease-stained and well-worn, and as a result, you could almost smell the petrol fumes when you played it.</p> <p>It was also the first driving game to let you rewind time (a feature much copied since), and was indeed one of the first games to come out for the Xbox 360. Now, as executive producer Clive Moody pointed out, its successor will be one of the last games for that console. Moody refused to be drawn into the likelihood of Grid 2 being upscaled for Microsoft and Sony's next generation of consoles.</p> <h2>So what is it like?</h2> <p>Before we could get our hands on the game, a procession of the men in charge of making various aspects of it talked us through their specialist areas. Moody kicked off by answering why it took Codemasters so long to make to a sequel for Grid.</p> <p>\"When we came into pre-production for Grid 2, it was clear that our ambitions were outstripping the technology and processes that we had, so we held back,\" he said.</p> <p>But at the end of the current console cycle, and having rewritten its driving game engine in recent years, Codemasters now feels ready. Moody set out Codemasters' overriding ambition for the game.</p> <p>\"We want to make the most immersive racing game that's out there, and within that, we want to provide the perfectly distilled racing experience,\" he said. \"It will take place on a real-world global stage, in US, European and Asian locations \u2013 there will be no fictional areas, and all the cars will be real-world ones.</p> <p>\"Players will be able to shape their own path through the game, although there will be overall goals. And their actions and successes will be reflected in a constantly evolving world.\"</p> <p>In practice, he said, that would mean that when you started off, you would have a one-man-and-his-dog support operation, but as you progressed, you would gain access to vast, well-equipped garages, sponsors would throw money at you, and so on.</p> <h2>Race and car variety</h2> <p>\"There will be three key types of race locations,\" Moody said. \"Firstly, street racing \u2013 tight, wheel-to-wheel affairs through iconic city streets [which will include Chicago and Paris].\"</p> <p>\"Next, there will be road-racing, which is new for the Grid franchise \u2013 taking the form of high-speed runs on open roads and long, sweeping highways, so you can put your foot to the floor for long periods. And the third element is track racing: it's still a really important part of the experience, taking in a selection of internationally renowned circuits including Abu Dhabi's Yas Marina.\"</p> <p>Associate producer Toby Evans-Jones talked us through the cars: \"There will be four tiers, based on performance, so you may see, for example, American muscle-cars versus European classics.</p> <p>\"The first tier will include the likes of the Ford Mustang Mach I and the E30-shape BMW M3 Sport Evo. Tier 2 will include the Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 and the [modern] Chevrolet Camaro SS, and will introduce traction and launch-control. In tier 3, you'll find the McLaren MP4-12C and the track-special BAC Mono. And tier 4 will consist of money-no-object cars like the Pagani Huayra and the Koenigsegg Agera R, with 1,140bhp.\"</p> <h2>Multiplayer</h2> <p>Associate producer Ian Smith stepped up to talk us through the multiplayer side of Grid 2.</p> <p>\"It's about redefining the multiplayer experience for racing games,\" he said. \"In the single-player journey, there's a lot of customisation possible, and it's about you telling your story. But the multiplayer experience will be more about what competitive players want to do.</p> <p>\"You'll start the multiplayer from scratch, and it isn't linked to the single-player XP system. It will be a fully emergent, social experience.\"</p> <p>Codemasters confirmed that Grid 2's multiplayer side would be built on Racenet, its answer to EA's much-loved Autolog, but beyond that, it remained annoyingly vague. Undoubtedly, it will reveal more about Grid 2's multiplayer experience as time unfolds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394386028\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344426914476/Grid-2-007.jpg\" alt=\"Grid 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grid 2</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Hands-on</h2> <p>With the talking over, it was time for some hands-on play. And the good news is that, while Grid (and, for that matter, TOCA Race Driver) were all about car-feel, Grid 2 has somehow managed to up that particular ante even further.</p> <p>First up was a road-racing sequence on swooping Californian Pacific Coast Highway roads, which looked simply stunning with cliffs on your right (so you were heading south). We were at the wheel of a pumped-up Mustang with 500-odd bhp, racing against a similarly fast and tail-happy American beast.</p> <p>The experience was a bit like Nascar on real roads, which required precision braking and, especially, very fine throttle-control. This stage was played on a D-Box: a hugely expensive seat, wheel and controls rig with motors that move you around to simulate real car movement. The effect was dramatic, with simply unprecedented amounts of car-feel on offer.</p> <p>Thanks to the D-Box, it seemed as though you could actually feel individual tyres starting to break away from the road surface, and the Mustang's handling characteristics \u2013 initial understeer followed by throttle-on oversteer \u2013 came through clearer than we have ever before experienced in a game.</p> <p>The other track that we were able to play was experienced in a much less esoteric manner, simply using a joypad (although the game was actually running on PCs). Its backdrop was the streets of Chicago, and given that we were driving a pumped-up Mercedes AMG SL65 Black on a pretty twisty street-circuit (some parts of which even had a concrete central reservation), it took us a while to get tuned in.</p> <p>But again, the car feel on offer was immense, and we soon learned to almost back the Merc into corners, braking and turning in early, in the sort of style associated with World Superbikes riders.</p> <p>As well as looking amazing (Codemasters talked us through the graphical innovations in Grid 2's engine at length), the Chicago track gave us an insight into the game's AI. Essentially, you could describe it as do-as-you-would-be-done-by.</p> <p>So, if you tend to lean on the cars ahead as you try to pass around tight corners (as we did when we started playing), you can expect to fall victim to the odd shunt from the rear. Conversely, the cleaner you as regards the cars around you, the better they will behave.</p> <p>The AI was also noticeably realistic, in that some of the drivers it controlled did actually make tiny mistakes, allowing you to take advantage and nip through, which contrasts with the driving-game norm of being surrounded by drivers who appear to be clones of Ayrton Senna.</p> <p>Even though it's early days for Grid 2, what we've experienced of it so far bodes phenomenally well. The cars feel much more real than any we've ever experienced in a game \u2013 and that includes Gran Turismo 5 and, especially, Forza, which has always felt as though it was built in a laboratory by robots.</p> <p>It looks magnificent, yet still exudes a pungent virtual whiff of exhaust fumes. It should make a fitting last hurrah for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.</p>",

The petition was launched by Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales on 24 June.</p> <p>The MPAA's <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/102147824/mpaa-comm\" title=\"\">communications plan</a>, which was first published <a href=\"http://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-recruits-surrogates-to-support-extradition-of-uk-student-120806/\" title=\"\">by the website TorrentFreak</a> and verified by the Guardian on Tuesday evening, showed the Hollywood studio industry body trying to seize control of the propaganda war that has surrounded O'Dwyer's case.</p> <p>\"The overall media coverage has been and will continue to be challenging,\" it said, noting UK domestic pressure on the Home Office to halt the extradition.</p> <p>\"To counter these assertions, the MPAA and its allies need a coordinated effort to focus more on the [alleged] criminal activity involved in the operation of TVShack and other similar linking sites.</p> <p>\"Ideally, this would be done through third parties \u2013 but finding third parties, especially in the United Kingdom, has been very difficult so far, so the MPAA must be prepared to respond to media requests on the issue and set the record straight to counter the misinformation campaign by our opponents.\"</p> <p>Howard Gantman, the vice president of corporate communications for the MPAA, confirmed that the memo was genuine and for internal purposes at the lobby group, which speaks on behalf of film studios including Twentieth Century Fox Film and Sony Pictures.</p> <p>\"The MPAA was reaching out to allies in the film and entertainment business who have a common interest with us,\" Gantman told the Guardian.</p> <p>\"The bottom line is that most of our allies do not want to go out and talk about it publicly because it's a controversial case. The allegation that this was some attempt at sockpuppeting is 100% wrong. This was an attempt to correct some misconceptions. That's all this was about.\"</p> <p>O'Dwyer's appeal against extradition is due to be heard in London in October. The case was brought by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which claims that his TVShack.net website earned more than $230,000 (\u00a3147,000) in advertising revenue before US authorities obtained a warrant and seized the domain name in June 2010.</p>",

  "<p>Samuel Johnson, in one of his great aper\u00e7us, responded to some pettifogging critic with the phrase: \"A fly may sting a horse, but the horse will still be a horse, and the fly no more than a fly.\" That sentence sprang to mind the minute I read that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/aug/06/paulo-coelho-james-joyce-ulysses\" title=\"\">Paolo Coelho had decided to take James Joyce to task</a>. In an interview in <a href=\"http://www.folha.uol.com.br/\" title=\"\">Folha de S Paolo</a> (one wonders if he chose that outlet for any particular reason) the self-proclaimed <a href=\"http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/culture/1131885-ulysses-was-harmful-to-literature-says-coelho.shtml\" title=\"\">\"literature wizard\"</a> contends: \"Today, writers want to impress other writers.\" He then names the culprit: \"One of the books that caused great harm was James Joyce's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/classics/9781840226355/ulysses\" title=\"\">Ulysses</a>, which is pure style. There is nothing there. Stripped down, Ulysses is a twit.\"</p> <p>Coelho is, of course, entitled to his dumb opinion, just as I am entitled to think Coelho's work is a nauseous broth of egomania and snake-oil mysticism with slightly less intellect, empathy and verbal dexterity than the week-old camembert I threw out yesterday. But the attack is, inadvertently, interesting. Coelho is not the first to attack Joyce: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2004/feb/10/booksnews.ireland\" title=\"\">Roddy Doyle has</a>, Alan Bissett has, and <a href=\"http://www.themodernword.com/columns/slightly_foxed_003.html\" title=\"\">Dale Peck made it the central, rotten plank of his sour and sanctimonious anti-modernist criticism</a>. Whenever there is a reactionary attack on contemporary literature, a snipe at Joyce is necessary.</p> <p>What are the criticisms? Joyce, they claim, writes for writers \u2013 not, presumably, readers. His works are sustained by a cerebral clique that \u2013 whisper it \u2013 don't really like them either, but use them as a trump card in one-upmanship. Joyce is \"difficult\", <a href=\"http://litreactor.com/columns/no-thanks-mr-franzen-i-like-my-novels-difficult\" title=\"\">Jonathan Franzen's catch-all term of dismissal</a>.</p> <p>Only someone who had barely glanced at Ulysses would damn it for \"pure style\". It is an utter come-all-ye, salmagundi, snarl and mac\u00e9doine of styles (Johann Wolfgang von Goethe famously said he didn't have a style, he had styles, a motto many aspirant writers in search of their elusive \"voice\" might adopt). Coelho \u2013 let's give him the benefit of the doubt \u2013 may not be complaining about the glorious polyphony of Ulysses. The exuberant styles might conceal a lack of import. As he says: \"There is nothing there.\" In Joyce's defence, I would say there is love, grief, anger, lust, generosity, small-mindedness, kindness and redemption as well as kidneys, dogs, claret, soap, what-the-butler-saw machines, classical statues, menstrual blood and brogues. But maybe Coelho isn't placing style against content but style against message. Maybe Ulysses can't be summarised into a sentence-long quote such as: <a href=\"http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100822220159AAvvnvV\" title=\"\">\"Remember that wherever your heart is, there you will find treasure.\"</a> Perhaps life is actually a bit less pat than that. Maybe Coelho was confusing Ulysses and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ4c1X5ene8\" title=\"\">the 1981 cartoon Ulysses 31</a>.</p> <p>Coelho gives the game away when he brags that he is \"modern\" because he can \"make the difficult seem easy\". I think it's an ethical as well as a literary proposition that anything that aspires to make the world and the people in it less complex, less paradoxical, less multifarious, is a kind of dirty little libel on reality.</p> <p>The real slander is to the reader, or rather, to readers. Note how the anti-Joyceans have all read him and then tell readers he's not for them: too difficult, too abstruse, too weird \u2013 with the \"for you\" hanging in the background. I've been there, they say, and you wouldn't like it. It is an attitude that surreptitiously belittles the reader. There is nothing as profoundly patronising as a middlebrow, supposedly \"literary\" author on a soapbox. (Ian Rankin, bless him, has always <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2006/nov/18/fiction.ianrankin\" title=\"\">taken any opportunity to enthuse about Thomas Pynchon</a> as much as Denise Mina.)</p> <p>There are high modernist books that take effort \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/mar/23/christine-brooke-rose1\" title=\"\">Christine Brooke-Rose</a>'s Thru, or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/author/william-gaddis\" title=\"\">William Gaddis</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/classics/9780140187083/the-recognitions\" title=\"\">The Recognitions</a> or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/author/hermann-broch\" title=\"\">Hermann Broch</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/literary-criticism/9780141181622/the-death-of-virgil\" title=\"\">The Death of Virgil</a> \u2013 but I've never yet read one that didn't repay the effort. On the other hand, I've read plenty of unambitious fiction that didn't reward me turning the page. Coelho and his ilk create a cocoon of their own limitations, and insist everyone outside it must feel and think like them. Writers and readers of worth know the real point of literature is, <a href=\"http://www.artofeurope.com/macneice/mac5.htm\" title=\"\">as Louis MacNeice so brilliantly put it</a>, that the \"World is crazier and more of it than we think,/ Incorrigibly plural\".</p>",
  "<h2>Introduction</h2> <p>You've seen it, channel-surfing on a Sunday in your pants. It begins like a ballet recital at a junior school and quickly becomes an astonishing sequence of improbable jumps and flips, executed diagonally across a square presentation floor. Alternatively, people do ridiculous things with parallel bars, pommel horses, rings and springboards. Welcome to gymnastics. Please drive carefully.</p> <h2>The basics</h2> <p>In artistic gymnastics, participants perform various acrobatic feats \u2013 jumps, leaps, turns, handstands etc \u2013 either on the floor or on fixed pieces of equipment, in an attempt to demonstrate balance, control, flexibility and strength. If you've ever fallen over attempting a cartwheel, your journey has already begun. Men compete in six events \u2013 floor, horse, still rings, vault, parallel bars and high bar \u2013 while women do four (all except the high bar and the rings). </p> <p>Rhythmic gymnastics, in contrast, takes place on a floor mat but requires ribbons, ropes and hoops for routines performed in time with a musical soundtrack. British Gymnastics is meanwhile encouraging the growth of general gymnastics, a non-competitive form featuring team displays which is open to all ages and ability levels. GMPD (Gymnastics and Movement for People with Disabilities) is also on the up. In any discipline, control and form are the prized virtues.</p> <p>And if you're doubting whether you can handle it, here's a video of a superb <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2012/04/04/86-year-old-gymnast-johanna-quaas-video/\">parallel bars display by 86-year-old Johanna Quass</a>. Now get out there.</p> <h2>Health benefits</h2> <p>Gymnastics improves flexibility and upper- and lower-body strength, tones from top to bottom, and builds power in the hands and feet.</p> <h2>Equipment, costs and practicalities</h2> <p>A good adult leotard \u2013 yes, you'll need to wear one \u2013 costs around \u00a320. Clubs cater for total beginners, both juniors and adults. <a href=\"http://thegymclub.org/\">Berkhamsted Gymnastics Club</a>, for example, asks for a \u00a320 annual membership and then \u00a37.50 on the door each time, and offers tuition with \"an open approach [that] gives you the support you need and the freedom that you want to progress at your own pace\".</p> <h2>Trendiness rating: 5/10</h2> <p>A leotard resurgence might be on the horizon in east London, but for most it isn't a good look. Not, that is, until you've toned up with a bit of gymnastics. </p> <h2>Inside line</h2> <p><strong>Vera Atkinson, British Gymnastics:</strong> \"Gymnastics is a beautiful sport, recognised since the very first contemporary Games in Athens in 1896. It produces all-round body fitness \u2013 strength, mobility, endurance, flexibility, body control and co-ordination are also aspects that can be used when entering all other sports. Gymnastics training also requires great self-discipline and personal organisation skills.</p> <p>There are many forms of gymnastics but to begin very little equipment is required. A number of floormats will allow participation in basic floor exercises. Modern gymnastics at a high level is taught and practised in specialist facilities with equipment such as foam-filled landing pits, so new skills can be learned safely.</p> <p>Whatever the age, the level of talent and the taste, there's a gymnastics discipline to satisfy your needs.

Currently, 12 are being paid 6% of the minimum wage.</p> <p>When contacted by the Guardian last month, that figure was 17 \u2013 15% of the company's call centre staff.</p> <p>The company confirmed that since it started using prisoners, it had fired other workers. Former employees put the number at 17 since December. However, the firm said firings were part of the \"normal call-centre environment\" and it had hired other staff in a recent expansion.</p> <p>Becoming Green said the category D prison had allowed the company to pay the prisoners just \u00a33 a day for at least 40 working days, but added that they could keep them at that pay level for much longer if they wanted.</p> <p>A company spokesman was unable to give the longest time a prisoner had been employed on token wages. The spokesman added that, under the arrangement, they were only allowed to take a maximum of 20% of their total call centre workforce from the prison.</p> <p>The MoJ confirmed that there was no centralised limit on the length of training placements, which was for prison governors to decide. The ministry said it had sought assurances from Becoming Green that prisoners were put into \"genuinely vacant\" posts.</p> <p>At the start of the year, the justice secretary, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8984942/Ken-Clarke-to-double-number-of-prisoners-working-full-time.html\" title=\"\">Kenneth Clarke, announced an expansion of mainly manufacturing work inside prisons</a>. Against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/may/04/kenneth-clarke-prisoners-work\" title=\"\">a background of disquiet from unions</a>, he has continued to stress that prisoners would not be putting other people out of work. Clarke <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/justice-secretary-ken-clarke-admits-plans-for-cheap-prison-work-could-jeopardise-jobs-7817812.html\" title=\"\">said last month</a> that such a development would be \"a very serious downside\" to the policy.</p> <p>In a response to questions from the Guardian, the MoJ said: \"HMP Prescoed works closely with the company, the probation service, local authorities and community groups to ensure that any impact on the local workforce is minimised.\"</p> <p>A young former employee of Becoming Green said that staff were told last November that prisoners, whose convictions are understood to range from murder to fraud and drugs offences, were going to start working at the company.</p> <p>\"We got a message one day saying that ... [the company] was going to start hiring prisoners.</p> <p>\"So I thought, 'Oh right, people who have been released.' And [my friend] said, 'No, no, no, people who are out on day release.' I thought, 'Can they do that?'\"</p> <p>She said that just before Christmas, about 10 members of the call centre team were fired and then a further seven were sacked. She left a number of months ago after feeling pressured into quitting.</p> <p>\"As they started bringing more and more in, they started firing people&#xa0;\u2026 They would have kept their jobs if it wasn't for the prison thing.</p> <p>\"They'd passed their probation period, they'd been there for several months. They'd maintained the level they were \u2013 that had been perfectly acceptable at that point. Then they [got] these people in for nearly free.\"</p> <p>She described the prisoners as \"quite nice people\" and said that some were very good workers, but added that the wage difference caused resentment.</p> <p>\"Everyone was pretty miffed because at the end of the day there's no way you can compete [with \u00a33 a day].\"</p> <p>A second female employee who has been on the dole for almost two months said she was also pushed out of Becoming Green despite meeting all of her performance targets.</p> <p>She declined to be named, worrying about the consequences for job hunting. \"I'm currently on jobseeker's allowance because I can't find another job because of all of this happening,\" she said.</p> <p>A former manager at Becoming Green claimed the company had been creating \"reasons to \u2026 justify dismissing people from the company so they could get more prison staff in\".</p> <p>\"The whole idea of what the company is doing is bringing in free labour for the business and relieving their employed staff of their responsibilities, because obviously it is more cost-effective for the business to have criminals working for them than paying a salary to each person.</p> <p>\"I left because I didn't like the way the company was being run,\" the former manager said. \"If people are rubbish in their jobs then get rid of them, I understand that.</p> <p>\"But if people are coming in every day, and are generating a lot of revenue \u2026 and the next thing you know is their jobs are on the line, there's no reason why these people should have been fired. I don't think it is right, just to save a few a quid. These people have bills to pay.\"</p> <p>The company has itself confirmed that staff had been dismissed since prisoners were taken on in November, but countered that this was part of the normal attrition rate in a demanding business where \"targets had to be met\".</p> <p>Nicola Vaughan, senior manager at Becoming Green, said that there had been \"performance issues\" with staff who had been fired.</p> <p>\"There have been a few people who have been dismissed for various reasons&#xa0;\u2026 but if you are trying to imply that we have replaced those people with prisoners then that is far wrong,\" Vaughan said.</p> <p>\"I think perhaps the people you have spoken to are a little little bit disgruntled&#xa0;\u2026 At the end of the day the contact centre industry has a very, very high turnover&#xa0;\u2026 it's tough.\"</p> <p>In January, Clarke <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8984942/Ken-Clarke-to-double-number-of-prisoners-working-full-time.html\" title=\"\">laid out plans to double the numbers of those working inside prisons</a> to 20,000 in less than 10 years.</p> <p>However, while <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/plan-for-cheap-prison-work-may-cost-thousands-of-jobs-7815140.html\" title=\"\">convicts working inside prison manufacturing goods</a> have been doing such work for many years, prison campaigners said that working at a \u00a33-a-day training rate for private businesses for a minimum of eight weeks outside of prison walls was a new phenomenon.</p> <p>\"This situation, I haven't heard of before,\" said Andrew Neilson, from the <a href=\"http://www.howardleague.org/\" title=\"\">Howard League for Penal Reform</a>.</p> <p>\"We do welcome these opportunities [for prisoners to work], but it should be on the same basis as anyone else in the community.\"</p> <p>\"We don't want the issue of prisoners on day-release being employed becoming one that divides people and effectively people are turned against those prisoners because they're seen to be taking people's jobs. That's not what should be happening.\"</p> <p>Chris Bath, executive director of reformed offenders' <a href=\"http://unlock.org.uk/staticpage.aspx?pid=24\" title=\"\">charity Unlock,</a> said he had never heard of such a practice where prisoners were spending so long in the private sector doing work experience on prison wages, and called the move a \"worrying development\".</p> <p>Steve Gillan, general secretary of the <a href=\"http://www.poauk.org.uk/index.php?home\" title=\"\">POA prison officers' union, </a>said that for any company to rely on cheap labour of prisoners was \"immoral and disgusting\".</p> <p>\"The association wants to see prisoners working and leading law-abiding lives, but not at the expense of other workers being sacked or laid off to facilitate it.</p> <p>\"Some employers must be rubbing their hands and the shareholders laughing all the way to the bank,\" Gillan said.</p> <p>\"The ministers must be held to account if the factual position is this company has sacked workers to employ prisoners \u2026 The general public will be outraged if this proves to be widespread, and proper scrutiny of contracts needs to be made public to ensure public confidence.\"</p> <p>The MoJ said that prisoners at the company who were being employed at above minimum wage were paying 40% of their salary into the victims' fund. Three of the prisoner employees were understood to be managers at the company.</p> <p>Speaking about the expansion of prison work from 10,000 to 20,000 prisoners over the next decade, Clarke told the BBC last month: \"It would be a very serious downside if we started replacing job opportunities for law-abiding people, and we've been conscious of that all the way through.</p> <p>\"Although we don't pay the prisoners the minimum wage, normally you can't start undercutting British businesses outside.\"</p> <p>He added that the CBI was \"totally supportive\" of the work initiatives.</p> <p>However, Clarke has not addressed the situation in open prisons, where inmates can still have months left on their sentences, but businesses can now pay them little more than a token wage for their labour.</p> <p>A Prison Service spokesman said: \"We want more prisoners to undertake challenging work, within the discipline of regular working hours, which will help them develop the skills they need to gain employment, reform, and turn away from crime.\"</p> <p>The spokesman added that prison work \"helps to reduce the chance of re-offending by setting up appropriate employment and rehabilitation work in the community\".</p> <p>In a statement, Becoming Green said: \"Corporations should have a social responsibility to help society. It feels that if they work with this attitude and behaviour it will help make a better society for all.\"</p> <p>The company added that this kind of work would \"enable [prisoners] to resettle and integrate back into society and not feel the need to re-offend. By working, prisoners can repay the victims of crime rather than be unproductive in prison and by working potentially turn their lives around.\"</p>",
  "<p>Around 25% of adults report symptoms of stress, anxiety or depression each year.</p> <p>Stress is our body's natural defence mechanism that helps us survive by alerting us to danger and preparing our bodies for action. When we feel trapped or threatened our brain senses fear and triggers our fight or flight response. When this happens we experience physical sensations like increased heart rate, stomach churn, muscle tension, tingly head, vomiting, tightness or pressure in the chest, muscle tension, or sweats; these are the feelings that we identify as stress. </p> <p>But what happens to you is not important - how you react is what really matters. So why don't we just change the way we react when we experience stress?</p> <p>Research shows that the triggering of our fight or flight response activates the right front part of our brain, which alters the way we think. When trapped or threatened all animals DART - defend, attack, run away or tolerate (accept their fate). Humans are no different but in our case DART thinking can make us defensive, aggressive, destructive and resistant to help.</p> <p>The problem is compounded by the fact that, in today's world, threats to our survival can be very subtle. For example we can feel threatened in a job, a meeting, a confined space or when we experience redundancy, disappointment or failure.</p> <p>So what can be done?</p> <p>The good news is that by managing the physical sensations and the persistent negative thinking we experience when stressed, we can stop stress in its tracks and restore our ability to choose how we think and feel rather than having that choice dictated to us by an ancient survival mechanism. </p> <p><strong>My top tips for dealing with stress are:</strong></p> <p>1. When the physical symptoms of stress or panic occur, accept them don't fight them. Accepting them as natural will stop you feeling inadequate, which will help you to focus on the next step.</p> <p>2. Breathe in slowly for five seconds and breathe out slowly for 10 seconds. Repeat this for five to 10 minutes. Slowing your breathing in this way counteracts the impact of your fight or flight response and restores your body to a neutral state. From here you stand a better chance of accessing more positive thoughts. </p> <p>3. Stop analysing your thoughts. While breathing slowly for five to 10 minutes, allow thoughts to come and go in your mind without dwelling on them. This will help you to resist DART thinking, which is likely to be irrational, and stop negative thoughts.</p> <p>4. Have one very positive memory in your mind and focus on it continuously during a panic or stress attack. Psychologists have shown that optimists experience a 3:1 ratio of positive to negative emotions. Focusing on a positive mental image helps restore your emotional balance.</p> <p>5. When you have restored physical and mental calm ask yourself what you're worried about and what can you do about it. Focusing on what you can do rather than what you can't restores your confidence and sense of control.</p> <p>6. Stop focusing on past failure or future problems. Accepting each moment as it comes programmes your mind to be more resistant to stress because you're more accepting of life's ups and downs.</p> <p>7. Spend 15 minutes every day on your own in quiet positive reflection. This conditions your brain to become familiar with front left brain thinking which is more rational and less reactive.</p> <p><em>Paul Bird is the managing director of <a href=\"http://www.emotionalfitnessgym.co.uk/\">The Emotional Fitness Academy</a></em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>In the teeth of the recession, the Ashmolean museum in Oxford has succeeded in raising \u00a37.83m in less than eight months, through lottery grants and more than a thousand donations from members of the public, to buy a major work by the 19th century French painter Edouard Manet which would otherwise have left the country.</p> <p>The Portrait of Madame Claus, a study for one of his most famous paintings, Le Balcon, regarded as a key work in the development of Impressionist art, was sold last year for \u00a328.5m, after being in a private collection in England since it was bought from the artist's studio in 1884. The comparative bargain price the museum paid represents the tax breaks for works of art going to national collections.</p> <p>On Wednesday, two pale serious young women came face to face in Oxford: Fanny Claus, the subject of the arresting 1868 painting, and Mara Talbot, the 11-year-old who, with her mother, gave the final \u00a330 donation to the public appeal.</p> <p>\"Maybe if she was smiling I might like her more,\" Mara eventually concluded, after studying her intently, and dealing coolly with the media \u2013 the photographers were bewitched by her own choice of outfit for the day, complete with flowery hair band, which chimed uncannily well with the painting \u2013 \"but I do like her very much\".</p> <p>Mara's mother, Vicky Hirsch, a freelance art teacher, had only seen photographs of the painting when she gave \u00a330 to the appeal last week. \"We live quite near and we come here often. It's so important for people to be able to see real things in museums for free. And it seems appropriate in this week when we're celebrating the achievements of individuals in the Olympics, that the little somebody like me can afford to give can make such a big difference.\"</p> <p>Christopher Brown, director of the Ashmolean \u2013 one of the oldest public museums in the world and the most visited outside London, with a million visitors a year \u2013 only saw the painting himself for the first time in February, in the gallery of a London art dealer. It had just been sold to an overseas buyer for \u00a328.5m, but the government had put a temporary export bar on it to allow a British museum the chance of matching the price. Brown was enchanted, and did some rapid sums in his head.</p> <p>\"I realised that both the National Gallery, and the National Gallery of Scotland, who would both have liked it very much, were tied up in fundraising for the Titians, and that because it carried an 80% tax bill for the owners, which would be waived if it came to a national collection, we could get it for a quarter of its value \u2013 and that we really might be in with a chance.\"</p> <p>The Heritage Lottery Fund gave \u00a35.9m, the Art Fund charity another \u00a3850,000, and the rest came from trusts, patrons, and more than 1,000 donations from individual members of the public. In gratitude, it will be sent on a national tour to regional museums next year.</p> <p>The painter John Singer Sargent fell in love with the picture in 1884, bought it at the studio sale after Manet's death, and brought it to England. By then the pale young woman was dead, too: Claus, a brilliant musician, had married the artist Pierre Prins, but died of tuberculosis in 1877, aged just 31. The painting had remained with Sargent's descendants until the sale.</p> <p>The Ashmolean is most famous for its archaeology collections, but has a marvellous art collection including outstanding works by Pissarro and other contemporaries of Manet, and early Van Goghs. However, of Manet himself, in common with most British collections, they have very little: a small landscape and two unfinished oils, and a watercolour version of his Le D\u00e9jeuner Sur L'Herbe, a work considered scandalous in its day.</p> <p>Colin Harrison, senior curator of European art, has already been on to the Quai D'Orsay museum in Paris to discuss exhibiting his new treasure side-by-side with Manet's very different final version, in which Fanny has retreated into the background, her face a blur, losing the expression of a woman deep in some private contemplation that makes the earlier version so haunting.</p> <p>\"Another obvious exhibition would be Manet in England \u2013 asking why in fact there are so few Manets in England, a real puzzle,\" Harrison said.</p> <p>Although the picture will go on a national tour next year, Brown cannot wait to have it home permanently.</p> <p>\"Our pictures are really very good, but I think when you see this work on the gallery walls it will sing in a way that few of the others can manage.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Sinai has long been an area beyond the writ of Cairo. The vast desert peninsula is inhabited largely by Bedouin tribes, who for decades have been marginalised, neglected and impoverished.</p> <p>But in the 18 months since the Egyptian revolution forced out the former president Hosni Mubarak, the Sinai has become more chaotic and violent. And Israel has become increasingly alarmed by deteriorating security across its southern border.</p> <p>The peninsula is a wild frontier, a \"new hotspot with an expanding terrorist infrastructure\", according to a report, <a href=\"http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/sinai-a-new-front\" title=\"\">Sinai: A New Front</a>, by Israeli analyst Ehud Yaari for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, released earlier this year. \"Measures are needed to prevent the total collapse of security in and around the peninsula [and] avoid the rise of an armed runaway Bedouin statelet.\"</p> <p>Israel has urged the Egyptian government to take firm action against Bedouin militants and smugglers, and has enlisted the support of the US in its efforts. During a visit to Cairo last month, the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, warned that Sinai could become an \"operational base\" for jihadists if security was not stepped up.</p> <p>The region has suffered from chronic under-investment in education, health and transport. Its inhabitants are among the poorest in Egypt. Added to the potent mix of poverty, alienation and tribal loyalties is a sizeable Palestinian population in the north of the peninsula, with family, political and economic connections to Gaza.</p> <p>In the south, massive investment since the 1990s in upscale resorts in the former Bedouin fishing village of Sharm el-Sheikh, and a programme to create a \"Red Sea Riviera\" along the coast, has further alienated the Bedouin. They are routinely excluded from employment in swanky resorts, and consequent resentment may have contributed to a spate of tourist kidnappings and armed robberies in the past year.</p> <p>In the north, there is markedly more violence. A pipeline supplying gas to Israel has been blown up more than a dozen times, disrupting flow and causing millions of dollars worth of damage. Armed gangs are trafficking huge numbers of people fleeing persecution, war or poverty in other parts of Africa, charging thousands of dollars for passage across the Sinai into Israel. Camps have been established, from which emanate horrific stories of rape, torture, extortion, misery and desperation. The smuggling of drugs <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/17/eritrean-regime-arms-human-trafficking?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">and arms</a> is also a major industry.</p> <p>And there has been an increase in militant Islamism. Israel says it detects the presence of \"global jihad\" militants and groups, some loosely connected to al-Qaida. \"There is a problem with Bedouin tribes drifting towards a fundamentalist Islamic ideology, making themselves part of the Islamic jihad movement, by which I mean a loose network of small terror organisations trying to fight the current order,\" Major General Dan Harel, former deputy chief of staff of the Israel Defence Forces, said earlier this week.</p> <p>Israel cannot risk jeopardising its 33-year-old peace treaty with Egypt by taking action itself. Under the terms of the treaty, the Sinai is a demilitarised zone. But the overnight military attack by the Egyptian military may be the first step in Cairo's efforts to regain control and impose order.</p>",
  "<p>One of the major themes to arise from the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/leveson-inquiry\" title=\"\">Leveson inquiry </a>into press ethics has been the question of access to redress.</p> <p>The inquiry has prompted a number of questions: what do you do if you can't afford to take a newspaper to court? Can self-regulation ever provide a truly independent consideration of complaints?</p> <p>But this goes far wider than simply the culture and practice of the newspaper industry. Perhaps it is time to take a long hard look at all independent redress mechanisms in the UK, to see whether existing arrangements are appropriate and whether they should be extended.</p> <p>Ultimately, the question needs to be asked \u2013 should all public services be covered by ombudsmen regardless of who provides them? The <a href=\"http://www.ombudsmanassociation.org/\" title=\"\">Ombudsman Association </a>believes this should be the case. People need to be able to complain easily and quickly, and this is all the more important when the services are no longer under the direct control of the state.</p> <p>Ombudsman schemes offer free, objective consideration of complaints when they have not been resolved by the body complained about. They seek to provide redress when there is evidence that someone has suffered an injustice because of a failure by a body in their jurisdiction. They also use feedback complaints to drive improvement. To function properly, and to be seen to be objective, they must be independent.</p> <p>Ombudsmen first originated in Sweden to protect citizens following the adoption of a democratic system more than 200 years ago. They work best in situations where there is an imbalance of power between the complainant and the body complained about \u2013 between the citizen and the state, between the consumer and a financial institution, or between the individual and a newspaper.</p> <p>In the UK, the <a href=\"http://www.ombudsman.org.uk/\" title=\"\">parliamentary ombudsman</a> paved the way and was followed by others dealing with local government and housing in England, and all devolved services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Schemes covering the private sector also emerged, and now include the world's largest ombudsman scheme, the <a href=\"http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Financial Ombudsman Service</a>, and others such as the <a href=\"http://www.pensions-ombudsman.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Pensions Ombudsman</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.legalombudsman.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Legal Ombudsman.</a> Many of these schemes are created by statute and the industry is obliged to abide by their recommendations and to provide funding.</p> <p>This proliferation over time, while extending access to independent redress, muddied the water for consumers. Who should you complain to about what? A problem occurred with the gradual privatisation of public services beginning in the 1980s. But where services are provided on behalf of the state or public bodies, they continue to be covered by ombudsmen. This covers NHS privatisation and local services like bin collection. Some wholly privatised services, such as telecoms and utilities, have patchy cover, while others such as public transport, have no cover at all.</p> <p>However, as with existing private sector schemes, the extension into areas provided by for-profit companies needs to be funded by the industries concerned and not the taxpayer. This doesn't need new ombudsman schemes, and indeed, there may well be an argument for consolidation. Extensions of coverage should be dealt with by current schemes. Broadly speaking, as the public services landscape becomes more complex, access to redress needs to be made simpler.</p> <p>In the short term this can be partly achieved by the creation of services such as <a href=\"http://www.complaintswales.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Complaints Wales,</a> which helps complainants make their complaint about any public service in Wales to the appropriate provider or ombudsman. In the longer term we should be aiming to get comprehensive coverage of all public services, including networked services such as water, public transport, utilities and telecoms.</p> <p>And what about the press? Well, an independent statutory press ombudsman would offer assurance to complainants that they would get a fair hearing, without in any way impinging on the freedom of the press or introducing government oversight.</p> <p><em>Peter Tyndall is the </em><a href=\"http://www.ombudsman-wales.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>public services ombudsman for Wales</em></a></p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>A secluded mansion against a background of dark trees and a creepy, bitter relative lie at the heart of an unfinished story by MR James, which has been discovered in the Cambridge archive of the master of the English ghost story.</p> <p>Found by scholar Rosemary Pardoe in the King's College collection of James's documents \u2013 the author was the college's provost in the early 20th century \u2013 the story sees an elderly gentleman relating the history of the sordid \"Purdue business\" to his friend, one Christmas holiday.</p> <p>Henry Purdue was an orphan, \"practically adopted\" by his aunt and uncle. When they died, they left their mansion to him rather than to their niece, \"a short stout red-faced woman she was, with black hair and snappy black eyes [and] a flavour of concentrated hostility about her\".</p> <p>The story, which Purdue has named The Game of Bear after the \"dreadful game\" played by children as the tale begins, ends as the elderly man considers some papers left behind by Henry. \"'Letter from CP' (Caroline Purdue, of course). 'Infernal woman. May she come and see me and talk over this painful matter. No, she mayn't.'\"</p> <p>\"Though an incomplete and untitled story was noted within the archive's catalogue of contents, no attention had been paid to it by previous biographers or researchers, perhaps in part because of MR James's bad handwriting: you really had to make a concerted effort to decipher it in order to transcribe it,\" said Pardoe. \"It was an incredible feeling to know that I was likely to be the first person to have read the story since MR James first committed it to paper.\"</p> <p>The story has been <a href=\"http://www.thesuffolkcoast.co.uk/the-suffolk-coast/m-r-james-competition/the-game-of-bear/\" title=\"\">published online</a> by Suffolk Coast, with the permission of the James family, and children are being given the chance to bring it to a conclusion to mark the 150th anniversary of the author's birth, on 1 August 1862. The novelist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/susan-hill\" title=\"\">Susan Hill</a>, famed for her own chilling ghost story The Woman in Black, will judge the competition.</p> <p>Hill called James \"a master \u2013 a master of the classic English ghost story, a master of setting a scene, creating an atmosphere and telling a tale\".</p> <p>The author's stories, from Oh Whistle and I'll Come to You, My Lad, to A Warning to the Curious, are known for showing but never quite revealing glimpses of horror \u2013 <a href=\"http://gaslight.mtroyal.ca/owhistle.htm\" title=\"\">the \"horrible, an intensely horrible, face of crumpled linen\"</a> which \"went nigh to maddening\" the professor of the former, or the \"terrible figure \u2013 something in ragged black \u2013 with whitish patches breaking out of it: the head, perched on a long thin neck, half hidden by a shapeless sort of blackened sun-bonnet\" of Wailing Well.</p> <p>Hill said the discovery of a previously unknown short story was \"a real treat\".</p> <p>She said: \"Young people love ghost stories, so here's a chance for them to find a great ending to a story James himself did not finish.

In a sidebar to its report are the profiles of the two female members of the team - Laura Bechtolsheimer and Charlotte Dujardin.</p> <p>Their male teammate, Carl Hester, is rightly described as a four-time Olympian. It goes on to tell how he encouraged Charlotte, who lives in a cottage on his equestrian estate, to ride, adding: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Hester, who is gay, allowed her to ride his young horse, Valegro, as a novice, planning to ride the animal himself when he reached international standard.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>What? Who is gay? What was the point of that? How did it creep in, and why?</p>",
  "<p>A 57-year-old man is to appear in court charged in connection with a gun attack on police in Belfast during riots last month.</p> <p>He faces charges of aiding and abetting possession of a firearm.</p> <p>The suspect, who was arrested in North Belfast on Monday, will appear at the city's magistrates' court on Wednesday morning.</p> <p>He was detained in relation to a shooting at Brompton Park in the republican Ardoyne district on 12 July.</p> <p>No police officers were injured. The shooting took place after hours of rioting by republican youths. They had been protesting against an Orange Order parade passing by their area early on 12 July \u2013 the climax of Northern Ireland's marching season.</p> <p>During the disturbances, police in riot gear came under sustained attack from youths throwing bottles, stones, golf balls, petrol bombs and fireworks. So far 17 men have appeared in court in connection with the rioting.</p>",
  "<p>Egyptian military attack helicopters have fired missiles on suspected Islamic militants in Sinai after attacks on security checkpoints, according to residents and officials. An army source said 20 \"terrorists\" had been killed in the assault.</p> <p>Security officials say it is the first time the army has fired missiles in Sinai since the 1973 war with Israel to recapture the Sinai Peninsula.</p> <p>Egyptian forces launched the missile attack a few hours after three security checkpoints were attacked by suspected Islamic militants in North Sinai's main city of el-Arish, about 30 miles from the Gaza-Israel border.</p> <p>Officials say six people were wounded in the checkpoint attacks including a military officer, two soldiers, two policemen and a civilian whose condition was described as critical.</p> <p>Israel welcomed the Egyptian military action. \"What we see in Egypt is a strong fury, a determination of the regime and the army to take care of it and impose order in Sinai because that is their responsibility,\" senior defence official Amos Gilad told Israel Radio. </p> <p>\"This is an Egyptian action that is being handled by the Egyptians on the basis of the information they have. If they don't remove and uproot [the threat], it will continue to strike.\" </p> <p>Brig-Gen Shmuel Zakai, the former Gaza Division commander, said that the Egyptian determination was surprising. \"This is an unprecedented Egyptian operation,\" he told Israel Army Radio. \"In fact the Egyptians since the Yom Kippur War have not deployed forces of this size in Sinai. It definitely won't be short and it won't be simple. We are talking about terrorist infrastructures that have based themselves in the area with the support of the population and with weapons.\"</p> <p>The military action followed an attack on Sunday, in which militants killed 16 Egyptian border guards before breaching the border and penetrating almost 2km inside Israel. After the armoured vehicle commandeered by the militants was blown up in an Israeli missile strike, the militants' bodies were found to be wearing suicide belts.</p> <p>Egypt, which has claimed Palestinian militants from Gaza were partly behind the attack, has closed the Rafah border \"until further notice\", leaving Gaza largely cut off from the outside world. It has also begun sealing the tunnels underneath the border between Egypt and Gaza, which have been used for the past five years to smuggle people, consumer goods, construction materials and weapons.</p> <p>Hamas, which condemned Sunday's attack, has also closed the Gaza end of the tunnels. Long queues have begun forming at petrol stations in Gaza. The vast majority of fuel used by Gazans for cars and generators is smuggled and costs around half the price of fuel imported legally from Israel.</p> <p>Hamas is anxious to distance itself from the attack and also to co-operate with the Egyptian government. Hamas has close ties to the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, whose candidate Mohammed Morsi was elected as president in June. Morsi said he intended to take steps to help the people of Gaza and ease its isolation.</p> <p>The 16 border guards killed in Sunday's attack were buried in Cairo on Tuesday amid angry scenes. Morsi did not attend the funeral after reportedly being advised he could become the focus of mourners' wrath.</p> <p>The Egyptian government is under intense pressure from Israel and the US to crack down on militant activity in the Sinai. The area has become more chaotic and violent in the 18 months since the Egyptian revolution. Morsi pledged to take swift and effective action to regain control of the Sinai following Sunday's attack.</p> <p>Witnesses in Sheikh Zouaid, about six miles from Gaza, said they saw two military jets and heard explosions. Other witnesses in a nearby area said they saw three cars hit.</p> <p>One resident said he saw attack helicopters firing missiles about 18 miles east of el-Arish in the area known as Sheikh Zuwayed near the Rafah border crossing with Gaza.</p> <p>The military also carried out separate attacks just outside Sheikh Zuwayed, officials said.</p>",
  "<p>When I say I am becoming a teacher, this can elicit any number of different responses. Surprise, approval, pity - they have all been supplied in abundance.</p> <p>People come to teaching for all sorts of reasons but I'm afraid mine are quite simple \u2013 I like talking about science, and I like talking to people. So when I went to do work experience in a local school, I fell completely in love. Despite being a handful, the students bowled me over with their charm, intelligence and creativity. Where else can you listen to the debate between two 18th-century scientists performed entirely in rap?</p> <p>I have arrived at my PGCE with 17 years of the British education system behind me. Which is quite a lot really. How many other jobs would you start with such a wealth of different experience before you have even stepped inside the door?</p> <p>I have seen a wide range of teachers and can recognise that they have all developed my understanding of the world in different ways. They all had different focuses and perceptions of what a teacher should be, and hopefully in the next year I can use this to figure out what I feel is most important. And most importantly, what I want my students to learn from me. Apart from the difference between an acid and a base, that is.</p> <p>Despite all those 17 years, I have no idea what to expect. I have got as far to expect it to be very hard work and unlike any other studying I have done before. I also expect it to be emotionally draining, physically exhausting and to lose my voice several times in my first year. But that's all part of the fun right?</p> <p>Like any other prospective trainee teacher, I am also full of fears. The biggest question I keep asking myself is will I be able to control my classes? Remembering what my class was like at school does not help. Teacher pupil relations hit rock bottom when the D&amp;T teacher got locked in the cupboard. Or maybe it was when the French teacher fled the classroom in tears after we decided that flinging paper around was more interesting than the past imperfect.</p> <p>I'm not desperate to be liked \u2013 but it would be nice to have the ability to interact with my students at a reasonable decibel, with everyone's dignity and hairstyles still intact.</p> <p>And then there are the other worries. What shall I wear on my first day? Should I get my hair cut? Will I get on with the people on my course? Though I am sure these will pale into insignificance when I have an essay, three lesson plans and a stack of marking to get through.</p> <p>I am looking forward to a new pace of life. To getting into the bustling, energetic and draining environment that are secondary schools. I can't wait to start learning about educational theory and pedagogy.</p> <p>I am passionate about making science more accessible and interesting to students. If I could influence just one student to take chemistry at university level, or even just at sixth form, I would be very, very happy. High aspirations for someone who has not even started her first school placement, I know.</p> <p>So for now I will stick to worrying about whether I have enough folders and Post It notes for the year ahead.</p> <p><em>Sarah Maloney graduated in chemistry and will start a PGCE at the University of Huddersfield next month.<br></em></p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

Almost half of Aleppo is now with the FSA.\" The regime's forces are weak, he said, because \"they lack self-belief\".<br><br>Our colleague Mona Mahmood contacted him again this morning via Skype and he still sounds pretty confident, despite the onslaught that his men are now facing. This is what he said:<br><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Syrian regime is launching a barbarian onslaught against Aleppo today, in particular against Salahedin district but FSA heroes are able to stand against this onslaught. All the news aired by the regime's media that regime's army was able to get control on Salahedin are mere lies. The Syrian army could not get forward even for one metre in this district. It is completely untrue that we have pulled out of Salahedin, we are still there fighting.<br><br>Tough battles are still going on there. Till now we do not have any result for the number of martyrs and wounded as random shooting is still going on. The Syrian army are using warplanes, artillery, rockets and mortars against all the districts in Aleppo not only Salahedin district. The old part of Aleppo is now sustaining great damage from the Syrian army, and the international community is just watching \u2013 even helping the regime.<br><br>We have issued an order to all the brigades which are based in Aleppo's countryside to head to the city and help other FSA brigades fighting in Salahedin now. We have more than 7,000 fighters in Aleppo now. <br><br>We are armed with our great belief in the fairness of our case. We will stay steadfast and persist to the end. We know that the Syrian army after this battle will retreat and many of its officers and soldiers will defect sooner or later.<br><br>All the weapons we have to combat this onslaught are guns, Kalashnikovs, anti-tanks, RPGs and some anti-aircraft rockets. <br><br>Salahedin district is the western gateway for Aleppo and one of the first districts liberated in the city. It is close to the college of artillery and armament \u2013 all the regime's forces are piled nearby in al-Hamadaniah district. That is why it is so important for the regime to get it back from the hands of the FSA.<br><br>Criminals of the regime are destroying Aleppo's most ancient district. People of Aleppo resent the international community's lack of concern about the destruction of their city but they do resent the FSA as some media claim. It is working hard to provide them with security. <br><br>We are securing bread for the people here, wheat and gas for bakeries and food for the civilians. We are helping the civilians who want to leave the city in finding a safe shelter for them \u2013 they can't do that by themselves. Aleppo's population is more than four million. A large number of them are still in the city and need the help of the FSA.<br><br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5022584095cb77f057201bf8\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-08-08T12:14:56.148Z\">1.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Kidnapped Iranians 'booked trip through Revolutionary Guards travel agency'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The 48 Iranians kidnapped in Syria had booked their trip through <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443792604577575221903873222.html\">a travel agency owned by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards</a>, the Wall Street Journal reports.

  "<p>As inevitable as rain in July and August is the onslaught of regulations, consultations and tenders with deadlines for a response set in the first two weeks after September's back-to-school rush. Every year ministers and civil servants clear their desks before the parliamentary recess and this year the Olympics has exacerbated the annual paper chase.</p> <p>On top of the major threads of public sector reform \u2013 open public services, the Health Act and the Localism Act \u2013 we have new guidance and regulations on how to implement change, as well as this summer's tender specifications. This may cause something of a problem for potential employee mutuals looking to tender this year, or next for public services.</p> <p>It will be necessary to discuss the projects together as a team and do lots of preparation, but the holiday season makes this more difficult than usual.</p> <p>The explanation that this \"quiet time\" gives local authorities the space to respond to government consultations fails to accept that, like the consultation drafters, respondents also have school holidays to deal with.</p> <p>The community right to challenge is a case in point. Introduced at the end of June, councils only had a couple of weeks to get to grips with this vital piece of legislation before the holiday season began in earnest. In practice it has been trailed for some time, and so the introduction should have come as no surprise \u2013 yet it still places unrealistic expectations on staff.</p> <p>Local authorities will be expected to get everything in order for the start of business in September, interrupted also by the rigmarole of the conference season.</p> <p>For those working in the public sector, a restorative holiday can be an impossible dream, with a pile of white papers instead replacing the latest John Grisham novel on the beach. There is, unfortunately, little way to avoid the issue other than to keep your ear to the ground and consider regulations when they come out in draft rather than waiting for them to be passed in full.</p> <p>Ultimately, the only sensible response is to issue a plea to those issuing consultations and tenders that they consider the practical implications of timing on the quality and comprehensiveness of feedback. Only then can we be sure to get the best work from the best people \u2013 something that is essential to the future of our public services.</p> <p><em>Ross Griffiths is a partner at </em><a href=\"http://www.cobbetts.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Cobbetts LLP</em></a><em> </em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for news, views and analysis direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<h2>TORT</h2> <p>Tort is more an umbrella of different topics than a single subject. It covers civil wrongs that aren't crimes but, if proved, result in compensation for the loss suffered. You'll cover the principles and key cases that developed them.</p> <p>Perhaps the best thing about tort is that you'll study the law behind headline stories. Should the Catholic church be responsible for abuses committed by priests? You'll look to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jul/12/catholic-church-loses-apeal-liability\">recent developments</a> in the tort of negligence for this. Is there a tort for breach of privacy? Naomi Campbell's case against the Mirror newspaper will shed some light. And the most interesting areas are those where strict legal principles either give way to a broader sense of fairness and justice - or don't.</p> <p>That torts change over time may make the subject interesting, but it is also the biggest challenge: caselaw governs most torts, which means a lot of reading judgments. Get used to reading long, often meandering, sometimes pointlessly complex essays written by judges. Then ignore the writing style of most of them for your own work, and aim for crisp, well-referenced arguments.</p> <h2>CONTRACT</h2> <p>This states the obvious, but contract law covers all of the features of contracts: when a contract is formed, how to end a contract, and what counts as having performed contractual obligations.</p> <p>After studying contract law, you won't be able to go to the student bar's 2-4-1 all-night-free-boozathon without wondering if you've given consideration for the drinks. You'll also develop a strong understanding of what a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlill_v_Carbolic_Smoke_Ball_Company\">smoke ball</a> is (no, it isn't that).</p> <p>But contract law won't just make you a party bore. An understanding of it is essential for civil legal practice. It underpins commercial law and opens the door to employment law. There is also a strong contrast with European legal systems in contract law, and an increasing influence of EU law. Though there are firm principles that you must learn, there is also room to develop your own views.</p> <h2>LAND/PROPERTY</h2> <p>Studying property law will bring a new meaning to the word interest. At its heart, property law aims to teach you when an interest in land is valid in law, how to create one and when it is necessary.</p> <p>This knowledge is clearly of practical use. Before I went to university I didn't know what a mortgage was. Some of you will, unfortunately, have landlords at university that are less than scrupulous. Land law includes tenancy rights and obligations. It's practicality is land law's strength, but be wary of giving out advice just because you study law.</p> <p>Lowlights definitely include the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20\">Law of Property Act 1925</a> - which includes what seems like thousands of schedules and millions of paragraphs detailing types of interest in land, all of which need to be learned. For me, this was like trying to learn an Excel spreadsheet by heart. However, land law rewards those that buckle in and get on with it - marks are relatively easy to gain if you put in the hard shifts.</p> <h2>EQUITY/TRUSTS</h2> <p>Perhaps the most mysterious of the core subjects, equity used to be a different type of law, built on ideas of natural law and justice, with disputes settled in different courts to common law. In the 1870s (that's recent in the context of English law), the division was abolished.</p> <p>This left us with the law governing equitable interests. One important type is an equitable trust and many equity courses will focus on the formation and effect of trusts. Equity isn't a core subject in many degree programmes, and many aspects of trust law are taught in property courses.</p> <h2>EUROPEAN UNION LAW</h2> <p>This subject covers the institutions, legislation and cases of the EU, and if you're wondering why it's a core subject, then it will be an eye-opener. </p> <p>EU law is firmly embedded in domestic law because of the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/68/contents\">European Communities Act 1972</a>. It means European treaties and regulations have effect here and EU directives must be implemented. The EU principles of free movement of goods, workers and services are also applicable in England and Wales. The meat of the subject is in understanding how these features are implemented and what happens if they aren't.</p> <p>The most interesting part of the subject was learning that great swathes of our law are dependent on EU legislation. Sex discrimination, other employment law, and parts of immigration law have a huge debt to the EU.</p> <p>I also think it's a subject that clicks into place when you understand the main principles. A lot depends on how you learn: figure out what works for you, then use it to learn the key structures and this will be an enjoyable subject.</p> <h2>HUMAN RIGHTS</h2> <p>Human rights law isn't a core course everywhere but is often offered as an option, and human rights law now threads through most other core subjects.</p> <p>Clearly the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) is central. But it's also only half the story. You will cover case law from the European court of human rights in Strasbourg as well.</p> <p>Human rights law is brimming with controversy and is rarely out of the news. Should Abu Qatada be deported? How far should freedom of expression stretch? Are our courts subservient to Strasbourg? Each of these questions rests on human rights law. And studying it is a great myth-busting tool - you will be able to spot the many incorrect statements made by press and politicians.</p> <p>A note of caution - as a subject strongly influenced by politics, history and current affairs it may be easy to get carried away in fascinating debates. But your course will deal with each right guaranteed by the HRA in turn and the slightly mechanistic way courts have interpreted them. It is important to get a handle on this, as well as the sexier aspects of human rights law.</p> <h2>CRIMINAL </h2> <p>Criminal law is almost certainly allocated as a compulsory subject in order to reassure law students that there is more to law than corporations, tax and contracts. Instead you will find yourself studying the laws of murder, grievous bodily harm, criminal damage, how to plead a successful provocation defence, and in what circumstances sadomasochistic acts in your own home may be unlawful (every law student's favourite: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_v_Brown\">R v Brown</a>). </p> <p>S&amp;M aside, the study of the law of crime is equally interesting as it is challenging. It's the first subject of the law degree where you will find yourself using Latin phrases regularly, and time is taken to get to grips with psychological concepts such as intent, recklessness, insanity and diminished responsibility. Far from enabling you to simply stand up in court and argue a criminal defence, studying crime will equip you with an understanding of the individual elements of a crime, while providing some of the most interesting caselaw you will come across during the degree.</p> <h2>PUBLIC/CONSTITUTIONAL</h2> <p>One of the most engrossing elements of public law is its current nature and relevance. Study is fast-paced and analytical, as you can find yourself studying the benefits of the relatively new supreme court one day, and arguing for or against House of Lords reform the next. Conceptual issues such as sovereignty of parliament and whether the Crown should be \"above the law\" ensure that there is plenty of room for debate, and current affairs are just as relevant as historical legislation. </p> <p>You will quickly grasp the legislative process, and understand the roles of various public bodies, whether looking at judicial reform, ministerial practices or the duty of the executive. Far from a dull overview of the government and courts, public law is an opportunity to really understand the inner workings of English law, and the decisions which affect citizens every day.</p>",

Against the background of fragile global recovery and the intensification of the eurozone crisis, Germany has recorded strong GDP growth and a declining trend in unemployment, partly as a result of previous structural reforms.<br> Several factors contribute to Germany's solid macroeconomic position. Germany is the only major advanced economy which had lower unemployment rate in H112 than it had in 2007. The level of German GDP has increased by a cumulative 5.8% since the beginning of 2010, compared to 2.3% for the eurozone. The monetary conditions set for the entire eurozone by the ECB are accommodative for Germany given the strong cyclical position of its economy. As a consequence of safe-haven capital inflows, yields are also at extremely low levels. Furthermore, Germany has a strong net external creditor position and a large, albeit gradually declining, current account surplus.</p> <p>The German financial sector has stabilised since 2009 and liquidity is abundant in the current environment. However, meeting Basel III requirements will remain a challenge for German banks in light of modest profitability and still a high leverage. Since mid-2008, German banks have cut their total eurozone exposure by \u20ac332bn, a 30% fall, of which \u20ac187bn was withdrawn from Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal, a fall of 44%. Despite this fast pace of deleveraging, the quality of the remaining assets may well deteriorate further as the recession deepens in the periphery.<br> Germany has all the ingredients of a declining public debt path. The economy is growing, budget deficit is moderate and nominal interest rates reached record low levels. Nevertheless the longer track record serves as a warning sign. Despite the fiscal rules of the eurozone, the debt/GDP ratio had increased to 83% by 2010 from 55% in 1995. During the 13 years of monetary union, the German debt ratio declined in only five years and has been above the 60% reference value since 2003.</p> <p>Following the pledge of \u20ac100bn to recapitalise the Spanish banking sector, Fitch considers the likelihood of disbursing all of the EFSF's \u20ac440bn lending capacity to have risen significantly. Given Germany's maximum guarantee of EUR211bn, this would translate into a 7pp increase in the gross debt/GDP ratio.</p> <p>Germany remains exposed to the systemic component of the crisis. A significantly deeper recession of its large eurozone trading partners could also push Germany into recession with negative repercussions for the fiscal stance as well. Furthermore, additional sizeable contribution to eurozone bail-out funds, on top of the EFSF guarantees, could push German debt level above 90% of GDP, close to the upper limit Fitch generally considers consistent with a 'AAA' rating. Materialisation of these risks would put downward pressure on the rating.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-08-08T14:58:06.968Z\">at 3.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50226890b57975a08080f33c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-08-08T13:24:32.512Z\">2.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fe349803-4eae-427f-8b1c-9a14afcd0dff\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344432499877/34b8c9e8-8482-4c86-806b-84a69285a5e0-460.jpeg\" alt=\"The McDonald's Restaurant USA Number One Store Museum is seen in Des Plaines, Illinois \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The McDonald's Restaurant USA Number One Store Museum.

Nonetheless, a below-target inflation profile would clearly leave the door open to more stimulus.

  "<p>The US justice department is looking into allegations that Standard Chartered illegally moved $250bn of Iranian money around the global financial system, according to a source close to the investigation.</p> <p>More than \u00a38bn ($12.5bn) has wiped off the stock market value of the banking group since Monday, when a New York regulator issued a damning report alleging the bank had flouted US laws in its dealings with Iran. The bank's shares lost another 16% of their value Tuesday.</p> <p>A source with direct knowledge of the investigation said the report was now being considered by the justice department, which could pursue a criminal case against the bank and its executives. The justice department works in conjunction with the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which monitors and enforces US trade sanctions against countries including Iran.</p> <p>In its report the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) said it had evidence of similar breaches by the bank in Libya, Myanmar (also known as Burma) and Sudan, all countries under US sanctions. Both the justice department and NYSDFS declined to comment on the next stage of the investigation.</p> <p>The bank has denied wrongdoing and said the regulator had not provided \"a full and accurate picture of the facts\". The bank said \"99.9%\" of the disputed Iranian transactions had complied with US law.</p> <p>In May Standard Chartered announced it was ending its business in Iran after decades of international pressure. </p> <p>John Coffee, a law professor at Columbia University in New York, said even a single illegal transaction would be enough to spark a justice department investigation. \"There are 20-year sentences for money laundering in the US,\" he said.</p> <p>The move is another blow for the UK's financial services industry, which has been rounded on in Washington following Barclays' alleged fixing of Libor interest rates, JP Morgan's huge London losses and a devastating US government report that concluded HSBC had acted as banker to criminals and terrorists around the world.</p> <p>The report is also damaging to the bank's top management, who only last week boasted the bank was too \"boring\" to be afflicted by the scandals sweeping the UK financial services industry. Peter Sands, Standard Chartered's chief executive, was recently tipped as a potential governor of the Bank of England and finance chief Richard Meddings had been linked to the top job at Barclays vacated by Bob Diamond, forced out following the Libor scandal.</p> <p>Peter Henning, professor of law at Wayne State University, said: \"Standard Chartered's head is on the chopping block.\" He said Iran was an oil-rich country that no international bank would chose to ignore. \"But the US and Iran have been at each others throats for 40 years. You have to make a choice,\" he said.</p> <p>Henning said the dramatic share sell-off may yet prove overblown. \"In the end this may not be HSBC but the question remains about how many heads will roll and how high up. Diamond has set the benchmark pretty high,\" he said.</p> <p>James Cox, law professor at Duke University, said: \"Frankly it looks like the bank turned more than a blind eye in its quest for profits. Once again we see a bank putting personal gain ahead of public interest.\"</p> <p>In the UK the Financial Services Authority is keeping a close watch on the situation, as it always does when share prices move so violently.</p> <p>Sands and Meddings have been forced to cut short their holidays and return to London to deal with the crisis. Meddings and Sands both joined Standard Chartered in 2002 \u2013 the alleged violations ran between 2001 and 2007. An emergency board meeting is expected to be called shortly.</p> <p>Only a week ago the bank reported its 10th successive year of record profits.<br>While it is not a household name in the UK, its blue and green logo is familiar site on high streets across Asia and Africa and the bank sponsors Liverpool football club. It employs 90,000 people, some 2,700 of whom are in the UK head office.</p> <p>The timing of the allegations by NYSDFS \u2013 which claimed that the bank's actions had left the US \"vulnerable to terrorists, weapon dealers, drug kings and corrupt regimes\" \u2013 has stunned the bank, which insists it is going to defend itself against the claims.</p> <p>Even as it admitted that it had moved \"under $14m\" for Iranian clients \u2013 albeit considerably less than the $250bn outlined in the regulatory order \u2013 the bank was unrepentant as it made it clear it would refute the allegations at an appearance before the regulator on 15 August.</p> <p>While it had breached so-called U-turns, which were transactions that US authorities allowed to take place as long as the money did not end up in Iranian banks, it said \"well over 99.9% of the transactions relating to Iran complied with the U-turn regulations\".</p> <p>The US regulator's 30-page report reproduces emails and conversations between Standard Chartered staff, including a remark from a London-based director when warned by a US colleague of potential problems in dealing with Iran. \"You fucking Americans. Who are you to tell us, the rest of the world, that we're not going to deal with Iranians,\" the director said.</p> <p>The director is not named but the exchange is said to have taken place when the bank's chief executive for America warned, among others, the head group executive director for risk. At the time, October 2006, this title was held by Meddings, who was promoted to finance director the following month. The director for the US at the time was Ray Ferguson, currently running the Singapore business. The bank would not comment on individuals.</p>",
  "<p>Sudan has finally agreed to allow relief supplies into the two rebel-controlled border states of South Kordofan and Blue Nile, where aid agencies say <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/06/act-now-stop-genocide-sudan-nuba\" title=\"\">fighting and denial of aid access for more than a year has left civilians facing a humanitarian disaster</a>.</p> <p>The agreement came the day after Sudan's negotiating team <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/04/sudan-south-sudan-oil-row\" title=\"\">reached a deal with South Sudan over oil transit fees</a>, potentially resolving a dispute that has threatened a return to all-out war.

But it is impossible to do so as long as the Khartoum regime continues to bomb and shell civilians. An internationally monitored ceasefire is needed immediately to allow humanitarian operations, and Khartoum must be pressured to enter meaningful negotiations to resolve the conflict peacefully.\"</p> <p>Last week, the World Food Programme (WFP) said it was going to <a href=\"http://www.wfp.org/news/news-release/wfp-plans-air-drops-continue-lifesaving-food-assistance-refugees-south-sudan\" title=\"\">start air-dropping relief supplies to refugees from the two areas in South Sudan</a> because the current rains made the roads impassable.</p> <p>A group of 96 international organisations has also <a href=\"http://www.internationaljusticeproject.com/2012/08/03/ijp-act-for-sudan-and-other-signatories-urge-unsc-to-implement-resolution-2046/\" title=\"\">written to the tripartite</a> (pdf) urging it to consider air drops across the border. They argue it is the only way to get aid to the area in time.</p> <p>Rebecca Tinsley of <a href=\"http://www.wagingpeace.info/\" title=\"\">Waging Peace</a>, one of the letter's signatories, branded both the aid access agreement and the oil deal \"a cynical attempt to meet the UN deadline, avoid sanctions, and wait until the international community once again loses interest in Sudan and South Sudan\".</p> <p>Yasir Arman, the SPLM-N secretary general, suggested the aid plan is unlikely to be operational until the start of the dry season in October. \"Khartoum is reluctant to agree a ceasefire because they want to sabotage the operation,\" he said.</p> <p>Arman complains of the \"moral equivalence\" afforded by the international community to his forces with Khartoum's proxy militias south of the border, particularly Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army, against which the African Union is currently trying to launch a joint military operation with troops from the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and Uganda, with US military assistance.</p> <p>Stressing that the SPLM-N was formed more than a quarter of a century ago \u2013 before Omar al-Bashir's seizure of power in a 1989 military coup \u2013 while the government of South Sudan has only existed for a year, Arman insisted: \"We are nobody's proxies.\"</p> <p>He said that, during the six-year interim period of the comprehensive peace agreement \u2013 which stipulated both sides had to work \"to make unity attractive\" \u2013 the SPLM-N were partners in a power-sharing government. They were labelled terrorists only after the southerners voted to secede, said Arman.</p> <p>The continued problems facing aid operations in Sudan were highlighted when Jamal Al Fadil Farag Allah, a 56-year-old Sudanese national working for the WFP, was <a href=\"http://www.wfp.org/news/news-release/wfp-deplores-fatal-shooting-staff-member-south-kordofan-sudan\" title=\"\">killed in an armed attack near Hilat Yatu</a>, around 80km north of Kadugli, the capital of South Kordofan state.</p> <p>WFP executive director Ertharin Cousin said: \"It is unacceptable for humanitarian workers to face attacks while they are working on the frontlines of hunger in countries like Sudan,\" which remains \"one of WFP's most challenging and complex operations\".</p> <p>Arman blamed Sudan's forces for the attack, which occurred in an area controlled by the government, insisting this was part of \"Khartoum's strategy of sabotaging the humanitarian access agreement, as has happened many times in Darfur\".</p> <p>Last week, the security council <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=42595&amp;Cr=&amp;Cr1\" title=\"\">renewed the mandate of Unamid, the African Union/UN peacekeeping operation in Darfur for another year</a>.</p> <p>On 3 August, the UN high commissioner for human rights urged Sudan to launch an <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=42619&amp;Cr=Darfur&amp;Cr1=\" title=\"\">independent investigation into the reported use of excessive force by government security forces</a> during a protest in Darfur, which resulted in eight deaths and injured more than 50 people.</p> <p>Arman maintains Khartoum will continue with its policy of mass starvation unless there is further pressure from the international community.</p>",

They say their case revolves around one key statistic: that although small fishing boats account for 77% of the UK's fishing fleet and 65% of full-time employment in the industry, they are allowed access to only 4% of the fishing quota.</p> <p>The result of this apparent imbalance, says a new alliance of environmental activists and fishermen, is that the viability of boats under 10 metres long \u2013 and thereby classed by the EU as \"inshore\" operators \u2013 is increasingly under threat. Big fishing interests not only dominate the industry, but are also threatening fish stocks. This, they say, threatens the existence of fishing communities that go back centuries.</p> <p>In Hastings on the south coast, a fleet of 29 small fishing boats still operates from the beach known as the Stade, mainly catching cod, plaice and sole. The town's fishing industry is part of the south-east region, in which 339 small boats have access to a defined pool representing about 30% of the regional quota, while nine larger vessels control 70%.</p> <p>Local fishermen say that until 2006, they were effectively left to fish as they saw fit, but the introduction of a European register of buyers and sellers in 2006 marked the arrival of a much more stringent regime.</p> <p>Paul Joy, a local fisherman and co-chair of <a href=\"http://www.nutfa.org/\" title=\"\">Nutfa (the New Under Ten Fishermen's Association)</a>, spoke to the Guardian for a film made as part of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/series/anywhere-but-westminster\" title=\"\">Anywhere But Westminster series</a>. In January, he says, he was monitored by a police helicopter while at sea, before his catch of cod was weighed and found to be slightly above his catch limit. Having already been fined \u00a37,500 for exceeding his limit, he is waiting to hear whether he will be prosecuted.</p> <p>\"If we were drug smugglers we'd understand it,\" he told the Guardian. \"But we're just fishermen trying to earn a living, and with the quotas as they are, we can't.\"</p> <p>At the height of the cod season, in early winter, each boat's catch limit has been set at about 1.4kg a day, which represents less than a half a fish. \"What we're allowed to catch doesn't even pay for the fuel to go out there and catch it,\" said Joy.</p> <p>\"We've lost five or six weeks this summer because of the weather,\" said local fisherman John Griffin, 52. \"You can't run a business like this. It'd be nice to tick over \u2013 but for the last few years, we've been on a deficit. Eventually, something's got to give.\"</p> <p>\"We've got enough car parks and amusement arcades in Hastings,\" he said. \"This fishery's been here for thousands of years and generations of people. To lose it would be crazy.\"</p> <p>This year sees a sweeping review of the EU's common fisheries policy (CFP), already the focus of campaigning by groups and individuals including Friends of the Earth, the WWF and the cook and Guardian writer Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall.</p> <p>Now, the small fishing interests represented by Nutfa have united with Greenpeace to produce <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/media/reports/manifesto-fair-fisheries\">a Manifesto for Fair Fisheries</a>, published today. It advocates granting \"priority access\" to such fish as cod, hake and monkfish to small fishermen, and allocating the quota \"in a way which rewards sustainable fishing methods and protects coastal communities\".</p> <p>Campaigners say the share of the quota given to small boats should be about 20%, but acknowledge the impossibility of such a change. The UK government has proposed reallocating unused quota, amounting to about 3% of the total, to small boats but the UK Association of Fish Producer Organisations \u2013 dominated by large-scale fishing interests \u2013 has applied for a judicial review.</p> <p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it was working with Nutfa on improving the way the quota is managed for smaller fishermen. Defra said the proposed reforms of the common fisheries policy would help small operators, because they should allow member states to take over management of their own quota, which would enable some of the interests of the smaller fleet to be prioritised.</p> <p>The European commission said it was also looking to the interests of smaller fleets, for instance by helping them gain access to more of the funds for improving vessels: the bigger a country's small fleet, the more financial assistance that member state would be allocated. A spokeswoman added: \"The commission has also proposed that fishermen should be able to trade quotas between themselves so that the quotas can be used efficiently and flexibly. In such a system, the smaller vessels could be protected by having a part of the quota set aside for them.\"</p> <p>The CFP reforms were passed by member state ministers in June, but they must pass the European parliament too, and many MEPs of various countries have links with the big, industrialised fishing industries, so there are fears that the proposals may face a mauling. The fisheries commissioner, Maria Damanaki, has urged members of the public to make their views known, as public pressure has proved key to the passage of proposals to ban the wasteful practice of throwing edible fish back into the sea, dead.</p> <p>But thanks to compromises made to get the reform accepted, a full ban on discards of cod, haddock, plaice and sole will not be in place until 2018. Some of the fishermen represented by Nutfa claim they are mystified as to what they will then be intended to do with fish that are caught beyond their quota.</p>",
  "<p>In the period February to April 2012, <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN05871\" title=\"\">1.01 million young people aged 16-24 were unemployed</a>.</p> <p>For young people, long-term unemployment <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/document/46/\" title=\"\">has significant long-term implications</a>.

Our goal was to get beyond discussion and tip conversations into action.</p> <p>We started to design new ways to support young people to become successful social entrepreneurs:</p> <p>\u2022 New ways of offering connections that will catapult a promising project into a sustainable social venture.<br>\u2022 New ways of finding the young leaders working hard to make their neighbourhoods a better place to live.<br>\u2022 New ways of helping a young person to build the confidence which will enable them to change the world for the better.</p> <p>We would like to thank everyone who attended the Social Futures event and contributed time, energy and expertise. We think we're at the start of something special in supporting, encouraging and inspiring young people to become social entrepreneurs.</p> <p>But it's only the start. We have since created a report of the discussions and what that could mean for future support.</p> <p>We are also keen to take the ideas and energy from the event forward. If the ideas and themes in this report strike a chord with your own work and thinking then we would love to hear from you.

  "<p>I used to play fantasy board games, battling with ogres and goblins, drinking from the pool of life, always on the look out for magical objects to assist me. I never dreamt that fantasy would turn to reality and I would be awarded the honour of carrying the Olympic torch and that it would impact so much on my working life.</p> <p>I'm a fundraiser for a local charity, <a href=\"http://www.hafad.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Hammersmith &amp; Fulham Action on Disability (Hafad)</a>. We're not a big organisation but we have a pivotal role to play in the community. Up to 30,000 people live within the borough with a disability and we support them to have the same opportunities, choice and independence as non-disabled people. In the last two years, we've set up a loyalty card scheme for our members, organised numerous events, including a disabled fashion show and two Swimathons and raised thousands for the local community.</p> <p>As with all third sector organisations, community fundraising is vital. In an era where money is very tight and there is an increased need for our services, we are constantly looking for new ambassadors to build on what we have started. I have to be out in the community raising awareness, talking to people and finding money. At the same time it is important to put something back and the torch has helped open so many doors.</p> <p>What struck me on my big day in Lichfield was that everyone wanted a bit of it; it was complete torch mania, thousands turned out just to see it, many more were clambering to be photographed with it. These torches are truly iconic and the reaction to them helped sow a seed I've been cultivating ever since.</p> <p>The thing I've noticed about the Olympics \u2013 aside from the TV coverage, the torch relay and the events \u2013 is that for most of us, it will fly past like the cyclists on Fulham Road, gone in a matter of seconds. I've spoken to people, many have felt distant and uninvolved in the Olympics. However, stick a torch in their hand and they might as well be racing Usain Bolt.</p> <p>On my return to London I wrote to every school in the borough offering to visit them with the torch. Since then I have been inundated with replies, visiting more than 20 schools, attending assemblies, sports days and being mobbed where ever I have gone. I even met a parent who works at<a href=\"http://www.gosh.nhs.uk/\" title=\"\"> Great Ormond Street Hospital</a> and now I have been invited there.</p> <p>It has been a truly memorable experience; so many people have held the torch and posed with it. I have been so grateful to have been given the opportunity to do so.</p> <p>Subsequently, the charity's profile has been raised, not only from local press coverage but by the fact we are talking to people and sharing this moment. Disability is not something you can hide from, there are 11 million disabled people in this country, yet only 2 million are born with their impairment; for 9 million of us it is in the post. No one is immune from it.</p> <p>It is important to get this message across and the schools are the perfect foil for doing so; they are the future, they are the community.</p> <p>In terms of fundraising, the torch will make valuable inroads as both a short and long burner. I'm looking forward to my next Swimathon \u2013 all the schools have promised to get involved and even do their own fundraising days for Hafad.</p> <p>In addition, a local supermarket have made us their charity of the year and the torch will be appearing there allowing their customers to get in on the act, all of course with a Hafad banner in the background.</p> <p>The torch is a magical marketing tool, if you have access to one, use it, it will help light your way.</p> <p><em>James Coke is a fundraiser for </em><a href=\"http://www.hafad.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Hammersmith &amp; Fulham Action on Disability</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>The painting of a postbox in honour of Carl Hester's win, alongside Laura Bechtolsheimer and Charlotte Dujardin, in the team dressage at Greenwich Park on Tuesday is going to be a little more complicated than for other contestants.</p> <p>Hester comes from Sark in the Channel Islands, where the Royal Mail's writ does not run. But Guernsey Post, which is responsible for postal services on the island, has said it will follow the Royal Mail's lead and paint Sark's only postbox \u2013 currently blue \u2013 the appropriately celebratory colour.</p> <p>Hester's background is very unusual. He learned to ride on Sark, which has no cars, by riding on donkeys, and insists that his success gives the lie to the assertion that dressage is an inherently elitist sport. His argument is significant because, if dressage is to build a legacy from winning gold at Greenwich, it will need to recast its image.</p> <p>\"My parents aren't horsey \u2013 they can't stand horses, actually,\" he said after receiving his medal, \"so that makes it even more ridiculous that I've ended up on this route. The three of us come from totally different backgrounds. It's amazing I learned to balance and ride on a bareback donkey; Charlotte came through the showing world [riding ponies in shows]; and Laura did everything across all the equestrian disciplines before she took up dressage.\"</p> <p>Hester and Dujardin come from unmoneyed backgrounds, but Bechtolsheimer is the German-born granddaughter of a multimillionaire who made his fortune in property, and her father has made a huge investment in the sport. Nonetheless, Hester insisted it was hard work, not money that got him and his team-mates to the top.</p> <p>\"I grew up on Sark, the most ridiculously small island,\" he said. \"I left home at 16, said I wanted to go to England and do horses, and worked as a groom for many, many years. There's a story up here that any kid could aspire to. You have to have the right opportunities and you have to find your way, but the obvious answer is that hard work and dedication paid off for all three of us.\"</p> <p>Hester believes the gold \u2013 Britain's first ever dressage medal after decades of domination by Germany and the Netherlands \u2013 can take the sport in the UK to a new level. \"It's shot it into a different league,\" he said. But the sport has work to do to shake off its moneyed, top-hatted image. Ann Romney's ownership of the dressage horse Rafalca, which was eliminated from the individual competition at Greenwich after posting a disappointing score, has caused difficulties for her husband Mitt, the Republican presidential hopeful.</p> <p>The Democrats have used the horse as a stick with which to beat him, forcing him to distance himself from his wife's hobby, and US comedians have had a field day with what is widely seen as a sport that enshrines wealth and privilege.</p> <p>Satirist Stephen Colbert mocked claims made by Rafalca's rider, Jan Ebeling, that dressage was not exclusively a sport for the well-heeled. \"It's something you can do with a normal budget,\" said Colbert. \"Yeah, it's really all about budgeting. You cut out a couple of lattes a week. By the end of the month, you've got yourself a $3m Dutch warmblood.\"</p> <p>Claire Shand of the British Equestrian Federation said dressage's reputation as the preserve of the wealthy was undeserved. \"Dressage is accessible,\" she argued. \"You don't have to throw yourself over massive fences, and you don't need a big, expensive horse to do it. Winning here will be amazing for the sport.\"</p>"
