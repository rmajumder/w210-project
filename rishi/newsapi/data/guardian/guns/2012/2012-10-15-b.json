  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>In memory of the dark days half a century ago when the world waited in dread to see if the nightmare of nuclear war was about to become reality, the government is listing the remains of two nuclear missile sites in Rutland and Northamptonshire. In October 1962 both were on 15-minute alert to fire on the Soviet Union \u2013 with the real risk of retaliation on Britain.</p> <p>In the Cuban missile crisis there was a 13-day standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union, when the US president, John F Kennedy, ordered the Soviet leader, Nikita Krushchev, to disarm the nuclear missiles he had placed in Cuba on threat of invasion.</p> <p>It is ancient history to children and teenagers, but anyone in their mid-50s or older will remember the days when the world held its breath in what is regarded as the closest ever approach to nuclear war: in at least one Irish convent school the children were sent home at lunchtime on the day when many expected bombs could fall, so they would at least be with their families if the insanity of mutually assured destruction became fact.</p> <p>The two bases being listed at Grade II are the former <a href=\"http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceFor/ServiceCommunity/Hive/Central/NorthLuffenhamHive.htm\" title=\"\">RAF North Luffenham</a> in Rutland and RAF Harrington in Northamptonshire. They form part of a chain of cold war sites, some still covered by classified information, many only <a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/professional/research/landscapes-and-areas/archaeological-field-survey-and-investigation/cold-war/\" title=\"\">identified and listed in the past 10 years</a>. The anniversary will also be marked by special events at the York Cold War Bunker, and the cold war tunnels under Dover Castle.</p> <p>North Luffenham was built as a second world war airbase and selected in 1958 as a main Thor missile site. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Harrington\" title=\"\">Harrington</a> was under its command and was armed with Thor missiles in 1959. The missiles were 20 metres long and 2.5 metres in diameter, with a range of 1,500 nautical miles, and 60 were deployed at 20 sites in the east of England under the codename Project Emily. At each base there were specially adapted or newly built hangars to store the missiles, other equipment, fuel, and for maintenance and inspection, protected by earth banks, blast walls, satellite stations, and double wire fences. The missiles were British property, manned by RAF staff trained for the task by the US air force, but the actual nuclear warheads remained under US control.</p> <p>The Thor missiles could be brought to operational readiness in 15 minutes after receiving the authenticated order to launch, and in October 1962 59 of the 60 missiles were made ready.</p> <p>The Cuban crisis fizzled out in a compromise, and the Thor missiles were phased out the following year. North Luffenham was the last of the bases to close as a nuclear site. It closed as an airbase in 1997 and reopened the following year as the St George's Barracks of the Royal Anglian Regiment. At Harrington most of the buildings, runways and taxiways were demolished in the 1960s, though part of the western perimeter survives as a bridleway, and part of the original operations building is in use as the Carpetbagger Aviation Museum.</p>",
  "<p>John Clive, who appeared in films including A Clockwork Orange, the Pink Panther and the Italian Job, has died at the age of 79.</p> <p>The actor and author, who was also the voice of John Lennon in Yellow Submarine and went on to become an international bestselling author, passed away following a short illness, his family said on Monday.</p> <p>For many, his most memorable turn was appearing alongside Michael Caine in the original 1969 version of the Italian Job in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ntVWRhfqo0&amp;noredirect=1\" title=\"\">a scene said to have been ad-libbed by the pair</a>.</p> <p>Clive, playing the manager of a garage that has been looking after a sportscar belonging to Charlie Croker (Caine) while he has been serving a jail sentence, names the final bill as \u00a3200. Croker, who tells him that his absence has been due to time spent shooting tigers in India, hands over part of a sizeable wad of cash which has been stashed in the car's engine.</p> <p>\"Yes, you must have shot an awful lot of tigers sir,\" says Clive's character, licking his lips and counting the notes.</p> <p>\"Yes, I used a machine gun,\" replies Croker.</p> <p>A year earlier, Clive had voiced the part of John Lennon in Yellow Submarine \u2013 a role that was controversially kept under wraps after the Beatles chose not to provide their own voices.</p> <p>In 1971 he played the role of Tormenter, where he asked the lead character Alex to \"lick his boots\" in the cult classic A Clockwork Orange.</p> <p>Clive also enjoyed extensive success with comedy roles, appearing in four of the Carry On films and two Pink Panther movies. He also appeared in such series as Rising Damp, The Sweeney and The Dick Emery Show.</p> <p>His writing career resulted in the international bestseller KG200 and other similar \"fiction-based on fact\" books such as The Last Liberator, Barossa and another bestseller Broken Wings.</p> <p>Clive is survived by two children from his first marriage - Alex and Hannah, a step-son Deane, and his second wife Bryony.</p>",
  "<p>Local authorities have conceded that up to half of people on low incomes will refuse to pay council tax after being caught in the net by benefit changes next year, and that there is little they can do about it.</p> <p>Under coalition plans to reduce council tax benefits 2 million low-income workers will face an average bill of \u00a3247 a year from April \u2013 a charge from which they are currently exempt.</p> <p>But the sums are so small \u2013 on average less than \u00a35 a week \u2013 that councils are warning it \"would in many cases be uneconomic to recover, with the costs of collection, including legal recovery costs, being higher than the bill\". The result is that councils are budgeting for large losses and potentially leaving the door open to widespread non-payment.</p> <p>A series of freedom of information requests by False Economy, a campaigning group part-funded by trade unions, found that the two dozen councils that responded were resigned to seeing swaths of residents refusing to pay the tax.</p> <p>In Darlington the local authority expects to collect only half the additional council tax charged from the 7,500 working-age people living there.</p> <p>In the London borough of Harrow the council estimates a third of the proposed tax will not be paid. While in the Lancashire district of Wyre it is expected half the charge will go unpaid. Non-payment will leave a black hole in councils' budgets, with Liverpool saying that it will run up a \u00a36m deficit because of non-payment.</p> <p>Other councils \u2013 especially those with low council tax rates \u2013 have decided to simply take the hit and preserve the current system. Tory-run Wandsworth says it will not charge low-income residents council tax because the cost of legal bills to recover the monies from persistent non-payment would be too high.</p> <p>A council consultation says: \"In all likelihood [it would] have to be written off when the debt is uncollectable which would militate against the savings made on reducing the level of support.\"</p> <p>Tenants and homeowners who fail to pay their council tax bills can face repossession and even prison. A 51-year-old woman from Feltham, London, was jailed for 17 days in April for non-payment of council tax arrears amounting to \u00a31,985.</p> <p>A False Economy spokesperson said: \"This latest assault will force people to choose between paying council tax and feeding their families, while councils chase them for money they simply do not&#xa0;have&#xa0;\u2026 Councils have a responsibility to mitigate and counter these cuts, but ultimate blame rests with the Conservative-led government that is slashing funding from on high.\"</p> <p>Many have compared the new council tax schemes to the \"poll tax\" debacle \u2013 a policy that marked the beginning of the end of the Thatcher administration. The poll tax, which replaced rates in England and Wales in 1990, was a flat-rate charge on adults with a 20% levy on the unemployed. It was scrapped after two years.</p> <p>Peter Kenway, of the New Policy Institute thinktank, said it was \"not scaremongering to say that this policy could be a repeat of the poll tax. Ministers simply have not thought this through and it is being implemented at a time when the poor will be facing cuts to welfare.\"</p> <p>Ministers ordered cuts to the current scheme \u2013 which essentially pays the council tax of the poor in full \u2013 to save the Treasury \u00a3500m a year but told councils they had to decide who would lose the money. The scheme begins next April and the government has yet to issue a consultation paper. Peers in the House of Lords will vote on the measures on Tuesday.</p> <p>Ministers are understood to be preparing to blunt the impact of the cuts by offering \u00a3100m of transitional relief \"for councils that implement local council tax support schemes and adequately protect the poorest\".</p> <p>Eric Pickles, the communities and local government secretary, will also look to cap the council tax payable by the poor to 8.5% of the full charge faced by ordinary households. However, documents obtained by the Guardian officials warn that \"under any capping approach, there will still be low-income households, potentially wholly dependent on benefits, who will be asked to make some contribution towards their council tax bill\".</p> <p>The Local Government Association says poor communities will bear the brunt of the cuts \u2013 and poor people will not be able to pay.</p> <p>The chair of the LGA, Sir Merrick Cockell, said money offered by the government would be welcome. \"But there is still a \u00a3400m shortfall to deal with. Councils are being put in a very difficult position&#xa0;\u2026 under the proposed scheme most councils will have to ask people on lower incomes, including the working poor, to pay more council tax than they currently do. </p> <p>\"Collection rates overall are very high. But there is clear evidence that, for a range of reasons including financial difficulties, the poorer people are the less likely they are to pay council tax. In their current form these changes are a significant concern.\"</p> <p>Labour described the changes as a \"shambles in the making\". Hilary Benn, the shadow communities and local government secretary, said: \"The fact that so many councils are predicting a high level of non-payment shows that the government simply hasn't thought this through. Eric Pickles' poll tax is unfairly targeted at people on low incomes.\"</p> <p>In a statement the local government minister, Brandon Lewis, said: \"It is right that our reforms help reduce the deficit by giving councils a financial stake in getting spending on council tax support back under control and helping people back to work and off benefits.</p> <p>\"Many councils [such as Trafford, Brentwood, Croydon and Mansfield] are planning local schemes that let people earn more without losing benefits, making sure that work always pays.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 October 2012. In the original the following quote from Hilary Benn was repeated and attributed to Merrick Cockell: \"Eric Pickles' poll tax is unfairly targeted at people on low incomes.\" The mistake was made during the editing process.</p>",
  "<p>It is a mark of how far British tennis has come that after 24 years of drought the country now has two women competing for titles. Like London buses two have come along at once and, though they remain relatively raw, keeping a lid on expectations is already proving impossible.</p> <p>The two, of course, are Heather Watson and Laura Robson, close friends off the court who, all being well, will be rivals on it at the very biggest events on the world stage for some years to come. On Sunday the 20-year-old Watson became the first British woman to win a singles title on the WTA Tour since Sara Gomer in 1988. Watson's victory in the Japan Open in Osaka lifted her to a career-high ranking of No50.</p> <p>Robson, who is 18 months younger, is close behind her, at No52, and three weeks ago reached her first Tour final. No wonder people are getting carried away.</p> <p>Watson's triumph was a fine reward for years of toil at the Nick Bollettieri IMG academy in Florida, where she has trained since the age of 12. With the exception of her family no one was more proud of Watson's achievement than the man himself, who on Monday said he had sent her his congratulations, in his own unique style. \"I sent her a text and it said: wow, holy mackerel, holy cow, holy shit,\" Bollettieri says.</p> <p>Bollettieri is the man who brought through Andre Agassi, Monica Seles and Maria Sharapova, among others, and under his tutelage and coaches Watson has blossomed into a title-winning player. She is as good a mover as there is on the Tour and her consistency means she is never going to be easy to beat. She may not have the natural power of the left-handed Robson, who possesses a huge forehand and a wicked serve, but she is trying to take control of matches when she can.</p> <p>Bollettieri says Watson should not worry about making rash predictions. \"I believe the future's very bright and she's not reached her ultimate,\" the American said. \"I believe she should not say, 'I want to break the top 10 or the top 20,' just, 'I'm going to go higher in the ranking.\"</p> <p>Praising the influence of her coach, Mauricio Hadad, Bollettieri believes the 20-year-old needs to find a way to take the attack to others. \"I think she has to come forward even a little more,\" he said. \"If she has that transition game [she can fight for titles]. I don't believe that just staying back there [will work]. She's going to have to put fright in the top players that, if they hit tentative second serves, she's coming after your arse.\"</p> <p>Speak to former players and coaches and most of them will say that Robson has the more obvious claims to winning a grand slam title. \"If you look at Petra Kvitova [the 2011 Wimbledon champion], they're spitting images,\" says Annabel Croft, a former British No1, who knows what it is like to deal with the pressure of expectation in this country. \"At the US Open she was pushing Kim Clijsters back, even on the returns, and you don't see that very often. She's got so much talent.\"</p> <p>Having struggled with injuries amid growing pains at 16 and 17, Robson has been fully fit for much of this year and her movement has improved beyond recognition. The junior Wimbledon champion at 14, she has been tipped for the top for a long time and she is starting to look the real deal. \"She's got huge weapons,\" Bollettieri admits. \"She's got the big serve and she slaps the forehand. The big thing with her will be physical conditioning; the faster she gets, the more solid her foundation is, the better she's going to be.\"</p> <p>Andrew Castle, a former British No1 and now, like Croft, a pundit, describes them both as a breath of fresh air. \"The great thing is that both have so much room for improvement. With Laura, mobility is everything \u2013 just look at Djokovic and Murray \u2013 but you can work on that; she's got all the talent in the world, fighting ability, a massive forehand.</p> <p>\"It's really very tidy. Heather is tenacious and her mobility is unbelievable. She just needs to hit the ball harder, move up into the court and take the ball on a bit quicker. You probably have only 10 or 20 current [top] players who are going to be around in four or five years, so why wouldn't it be these two who get up into the top 10?\"</p> <p>Robson has always been something of the chosen one \u2013 winning junior Wimbledon was always going to get more attention than Watson's junior US Open triumph the following year \u2013 but the pair seem to feed off each other. When Robson was chosen above Watson to partner Andy Murray in the mixed doubles at the Olympics, there could easily have been a problem between the two. But it seems not.</p> <p>\"I was really interested to see how Heather would do in the summer,\" Croft says. \"She didn't get chosen to be Andy's partner, even though she had won doubles titles. I think she was probably quite taken aback. Then to watch Laura do so well at the US Open must have been hard. But clearly they're so good for each other. It's an exciting time.\"</p>",
  "<p>Do we live as one nation or two? That question has dominated the party conference season. It returned with a vengeance on Monday, but not in a form that Benjamin Disraeli would have expected. In Edinburgh on Monday the question was not the division between the two nations of the rich and the poor, but the division between Scotland and the United Kingdom.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/15/scottish-independence-referendum-cameron-salmond\" title=\"\">signing of an agreement </a>between the UK and the Scottish governments on the terms of the independence referendum is a milestone. Both sides appear ready to accept the outcome. It would feel more historic if the vote were going to happen any time soon, rather than in 2014. But the vote will be the first time that Scotland has voted on its national status in the democratic era. It may lead to the further splintering of the UK. It would change the lives of everyone in these islands. There is no doubt that the Scottish people voted for this process to begin. By handing the Scottish Nationalists a majority of seats at Holyrood last year, they put the future of the union unequivocally in the arena.</p> <p>Spain and Canada have been amazed at how ready the UK government has been to facilitate such a move. At a time when Catalan and Qu\u00e9becois separatist feeling is running high, Madrid and Ottawa have not been so relaxed as London is here. The UK government deserves credit for this approach. It is the democratic path. But it may look like reckless overconfidence if Scotland votes yes. Don't underestimate this moment.</p> <p>Monday's <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Agreement-final-for-signing.pdf\" title=\"\">agreement</a> between David Cameron and Alex Salmond is not the end of the phoney war, however. There will be plenty more phoney between now and autumn 2014.&#xa0;But the terms of combat for the future of Britain have now been set. They are, broadly speaking, the right ones.</p> <p>Both sides deserve some credit for the readiness to compromise. A few weeks ago, it looked as if a deal might not be done, with Mr Salmond in particular posing as a leader who could ignore the UK and the law.</p> <p>The deal means that the referendum will have a firm legal basis. It will be crafted in Scotland with British authority. This was essential. Without such a basis, the possibility of legal challenge to both the referendum and the result was very real. The constitution has been followed, but in a politically practical way.</p> <p>Both sides have won something in the trading between the Scottish secretary, Michael Moore, and the deputy first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. But it is Mr Moore, and behind him Mr Cameron, who have <a href=\" http://constitution-unit.com/2012/10/15/press-release-scottish-independence-referendum-cameron-wins-first-round/\" title=\"\">come off best</a>. Restricting the referendum to a single question \u2013 an independent Scotland or not? \u2013 removes the possibility that independence might win by a wafer-thin majority while further devolution \u2013 which may actually be what most <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/15/scottish-independence-devo-max-referendum?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Scots want</a> \u2013 was overwhelmingly endorsed. That would have been a recipe for political confusion. Having a single question deals with that.</p> <p>All the <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/independence-blow-as-support-for-union-soars.19077088\" title=\"\">current polling</a> shows that the single question \u2013 whatever its eventual form and whatever the franchise terms \u2013 will go the way of the status quo. That is why Mr Cameron signed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/oct/15/salmond-cameron-scottish-independence-referendum-live?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">on the dotted line</a>. But the result is certainly not a done deal. The mood will change over the next two years. And the current polling also shows that the Scottish Nationalists remain Scotland's dominant party, at least in the Holyrood context. Mr Salmond signed off partly because he is a gambler and partly because he thinks he will be returned as first minister in 2016, whatever the result in 2014.</p> <p>Two years is too long to wait. But the deal is done. There is a rich debate to conduct now, not just in Scotland, about the best constitutional arrangements for these islands \u2013 and not least about the rights of<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/11/scottish-independence-youth-vote-referendum?intcmp=239\" title=\"\"> 16- and 17-year-olds</a> in the process. On Wednesday, <a href=\"http://www.glasgowlibdems.org.uk/index.php/news/uk-lib-dem-news/28-scottish-lib-dems/1878-no-referendum-required-for-more-powers\" title=\"\">the Liberal Democrats </a>will make some proposals. At the weekend Mr Salmond addresses his party conference. Let us not prejudge the unfolding argument, but let the guiding star of it always be the best way of securing the good of all, just as it should be in that other One Nation debate.</p>",
  "<p>Andy Hazell's disciplinary hearing following his red card in Gloucester's Amlin Challenge Cup match at Mont de Marsan last Thursday will be held next week but none of the French club's players will be cited for alleged eye-gouging because of a lack of video evidence.</p> <p>The flanker Hazell was dismissed 15 minutes into the second half for following up a flurry of punches on the prop S\u00e9bastien Ormaechea with a knee to the head. He apologised afterwards for his reaction, saying there had been three attempts to make contact with his eyes and that he snapped.</p> <p>Gloucester provided photographic evidence of injuries to Hazell's eyes at the end of the match and asked the citing commissioner John West to review three passages of play. The citing deadline was Saturday night but commissioners are allowed extra time if they feel an incident merits further examination.</p> <p>West could not find evidence after looking at the video from various camera angles to justify citing any of the Top 14 club's players and the regulations do not allow clubs to cite opponents. Nigel Davies, Gloucester's director of rugby, said after the game that, although he expected Hazell to be suspended for his loss of control, he felt it was important that those who sparked the reaction should also be punished.</p> <p>Hazell's hearing was due to be held this Thursday but Gloucester face another French team, Bordeaux B\u00e8gles, at Kingsholm that night and asked for the case to be put back. The 34-year-old wing-forward, who faces a ban of between three and 12 weeks, will not be free to play this week, nor will the Top 14 side's former Sale No8, Sisa Koyamaibole, who was on Monday cited for allegedly biting the London Irish back-row Declan Danaher during Saturday's 43-14 defeat by the Premiership club.</p> <p>Two other players were cited after the opening round of Heineken Cup matches. The Glasgow wing Tommy Seymour will answer a charge of making a dangerous tackle on his opposite number Vasily Artemyev during his side's defeat by Northampton on Sunday and Clermont Auvergne's Scotland and Lions lock Nathan Hines has been accused of stamping during the victory over the Scarlets, a match that saw his alleged victim, the wing Morgan Stoddart, sent off after receiving two yellow cards.</p> <p>Cardiff Blues expect the Wales captain Sam Warburton to be available for Sunday's Heineken Cup group game against Toulon at the Arms Park after the flanker suffered a dislocated finger in the opening minutes at Sale last weekend.</p> <p>Warburton had to go to hospital because the finger could not be put back into its socket on the field. He was told on Monday that he will not require surgery and the Blues will wait for the joint to settle before deciding whether to include him against Toulon, a match they need to win after blowing a 15-point lead against the Sharks.</p> <p>Wales next Monday announce their squad for the autumn internationals and Warburton will be fit to lead the side. Gavin Henson may be recalled after marking his comeback from injury with two impressive performances for London Welsh but the club's director of rugby, Lyn Jones, believes the 30-year-old, who was in the Six Nations squad this year but failed to make a match 22, needs more time, having played little rugby in the past three years.</p> <p>\"Gavin has been excellent,\" said Jones. \"He has taken responsibility in the dressing room and stood up. He has a high level of ability and he is a world-class goal-kicker but he has been back for only two matches. We need to bide our time a bit, let him settle in and play. Then we'll see what comes of it.\"</p> <p>Munster's Ireland outside-half Ronan O'Gara will miss this weekend's Heineken Cup match against Edinburgh after suffering a hamstring strain in Paris in the opening round. The province received the results of a scan on Monday, saying that the news was \"not good\".</p>",
  "<p>In the weeks since Mark Zuckerberg trumpeted Facebook's growth to 1bn monthly users, there has been a lot of focus on the social network's <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebook-earnings-targets-are-going-down-2012-10-14http://\">struggle to convince investors of its worth</a>. </p> <p>But if almost daily reports on user privacy are any indication, Facebook should be just as concerned about its relationship with users, who are increasingly miffed about what the site does or doesn't do with their data. </p> <p>On Monday, for example, came a dispatch on <a href=\"http://betabeat.com/2012/10/facebooks-wonky-privacy-controls-now-outing-lgbt-youth-without-their-consent/\">Facebook's labyrinthian suite of privacy controls</a>, and how they still display private information. </p> <p>But the biggest splashes in recent weeks came in the form of alleged privacy breaches within the site: one rumor that Facebook was scanning private user messages to equate conversation with page \"likes\", and another that claimed private messages were being posted to public-facing user timelines. </p> <p>Facebook reps will tell you that such rumors come with the territory of being a hugely popular site; however, the site's historically clunky evolution has meant that the deployment of new features \u2013 the timeline \u2013 and refreshed scrutiny around old mechanisms \u2013 a long-standing technology that analyzes the links sent in private messaging \u2013 has resulted in confusion and, in turn, suspicion. Maybe that's why when more than 625,000 people in Zuckerberg's subscriber base <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100518568346671\">replied to his October 4</a> 1-billion-followers announcement, one theme stuck out among the well-wishes, as illustrated by this message from a user named Neville Unvalla:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mark, while Facebook has transformed our lives over the last few years, the only thing I would ask is to not constantly change your privacy policies and to give users COMPLETE control of their private information!</p> </blockquote> <p>When French media reported in late September that a glitch had made private messages visible on user timelines, the story was quickly picked up in the US. The rumors went global, and though since disproved they persist, almost in the manner of conspiracy theory. </p> <p>Among several users who wrote the Guardian with such allegations (and screenshots) in response to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/us-news-blog/2012/sep/24/facebook-leaking-private-messages\">this story</a> was Caroline Ardrey, 25, a doctoral student at Oxford. <br> \"There are lots of people who are really angry about having their privacy abused, not least me,\" wrote Ardrey. She remains convinced that Facebook invaded her privacy and that of her friends. </p> <p>In a phone interview with the Guardian on October 10, Facebook's Pan-Euro communications manager Iain Mackenzie said a rash of similar allegations arose last year but that they \"didn't gain the same traction\" as recent reports. </p> <p>\"We did a really high priority investigation of it,\" which included a review with the site's engineers, Mackenzie said. \"To have [private messages] publish to [private walls], somebody would've had to make a technological mechanism that was never created.\"</p> <p>Simply put, here's the explanation: people spoke differently on Facebook when Zuckerberg first built it; it was college-kids-only, after all. But when the company cast a wider social net \u2013 employers, parents, distant relatives, far-flung friends \u2013 the tone changed. And not knowing exactly how those old public messages were going to be displayed on public-facing timelines years later resulted in confusion and, later, suspicion that borders on conspiracy theory. </p> <p>\"Facebook doesn't exist in isolation,\" Mackenzie said. \"There are bad things and many good things going on in the online world. It's not surprising that people look at the service that's closest to them and are at least receptive to these myths.\" </p> <h2>'I've got nothing to hide, so it doesn't worry me'</h2> <p>Another topic of scrutiny Mackenzie acknowledges was a recent story that reported that the <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/facebook/2012/10/04/facebook-confirms-it-is-scanning-your-private-messages-for-links-so-it-can-increase-like-counters/\">content of private Facebook messages is analyzed</a> by the network in order to compute a number score on shares, likes and interactions around a news story, public figure or topic. This is different from liking a Facebook page, which still takes direct user interaction. But a <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/50608606\">video posted</a> by Polish programmers showing them gaming the system resulted in Facebook's quick acknowledgment that a bug did in fact exist. </p> <p>Still, analyzing public and private conversations to put a number score on shares and likes around a topic \"has been a part of the platform possibly as long as Facebook has existed,\" Mackenzie added. </p> <p>The problem, it seems, is that the rumors attempting to deconstruct how Facebook uses data haven't historically been met with clarity from the social network itself. The site has long been able analyze, display and, essentially, put a number score on what users say and do, but it takes programmers publicly manipulating the system to address it. And Facebook doesn't actually post users' private messages to public timelines, but whatever reassurance the network has presented on the issue hasn't been enough to completely quell the conversation that continues on about it. </p> <p>More transparency on the network side is needed, but it also must be said that millions of users have overlooked and adapted to the site's many changes without asking the important questions they're asking now. And more importantly, despite their vocal protests, they're not leaving Facebook. In the end, the benefits of human connection outweigh the data users give up. </p> <p>Indeed, users like Ardrey will continue to use Facebook as the site processes even more changes to the platform \u2013 most recently, a fresh attempt at e-commerce with the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/about/gifts\">\"gifts\"</a> platform.

  "<p>This was styled as the moment where the British bulldog started biting back. For years, Conservatives have dreamed of seizing powers back from Brussels. On Monday, it finally fell to Theresa May to go to the Commons and explain how she would actually bring sovereignty back home \u2013 by exercising a block opt-out of 130 EU policing and security provisions. Or, at least, that was the story sold to <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4589126/Home-Secretary-to-help-Britain-opt-out-from-EU-powers.html\" title=\"\">the Eurosceptic press</a> in advance.</p> <p>In the event, the home secretary served up fudge \u2013 and with catastrophic presentation. She was rewriting her statement until so late in the day that she was unable to provide it to the opposition in advance, earning a ticking off from the speaker for breaching the conventional courtesies. Labour's Yvette Cooper was merciless in exploiting chaos born of incoherence. Mrs May set herself against the generality of European justice provisions, but had nothing to say about which specific elements she found objectionable \u2013 the worst she said was that some powers were \"less useful\" than others. The most significant, such as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/european-arrest-warrant\" title=\"\">European arrest warrant</a>, which was used to catch one July 2005 terrorist, are so obviously important in a world of cross-border crime that she waffled to suggest that she could somehow negotiate alternative means of achieving the same ends. She will no doubt say the same about the sharing of criminal intelligence. But why should every other country in Europe be desperate to stitch together new understandings with the UK on such things, immediately after it has walked away from all existing arrangements?</p> <p>If, indeed, that really is what happens in the end. For Monday's chaos was compounded by the home secretary's admission that she was, in fact, not announcing anything, merely signalling that she was \"minded\" to have Britain opt out further down the line. After a weekend in which the education secretary has seen fit to relay to the continent that, if it came to the crunch, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2217355/Were-ready-walk-Europe-Prime-Ministers-closest-ally-Michael-Gove-sparks-EU-furore-dramatic-admission.html\" title=\"\">he would rather pull out than stay in</a>, Mrs May no doubt felt a competitive pressure to prove that she too would restore Britain to the supposedly splendid isolation of some imagined yesteryear. The backbenches cheered her suggestion of bringing sovereignty home, but the posture is not serious. As<a href=\"http://www.cels.law.cam.ac.uk/Media/working_papers/Optout%20text%20final.pdf\" title=\"\"> a Cambridge University report </a>has just documented, Britain can opt out of these particular 130 provisions, but \u2013 even before it finds itself pleading to rejoin the most necessary \u2013 EU authority would remain on a raft of police and criminal matters negotiated post-Lisbon.</p> <p>On the question of Europe, however, with today's Tory party such reality checks no longer apply. The fact that they are now more interested in posing as tough on Brussels than being tough than on criminals who run overseas speaks volumes.</p>",
  "<p>Starbucks has paid just \u00a38.6m in taxes on a reported \u00a33bn in UK sales since 1998, when it launched its first UK coffee shop, despite having opened 735 outlets, according to research by Reuters.</p> <p>The disclosure led to calls by pressure groups and MPs for an inquiry into the company's tax affairs, which one MP called scandalous.</p> <p>In the past three years, Starbucks paid no tax on its UK earnings after recording annual losses in company accounts, despite US executives of the Seattle company claiming in telephone calls with investors, transcripts of which have been seen by the news agency, that the UK business was profitable.</p> <p>The contradictions highlight legal tax-avoidance tactics used by multinational companies by loading UK subsidiaries with debts from other parts of the business based in countries with lower tax thresholds.</p> <p>In 2007, the chief operating officer, Martin Coles, told analysts in a fourth quarter results presentation that the UK unit's profits were funding Starbucks' expansion in overseas markets. The chief finance officer at the time, Peter Bocian, added that the UK division enjoyed operating profit margins of almost 15% that year, equivalent to nearly \u00a350m in profit.</p> <p>Accounts filed with Companies House, which must be a truthful reflection of the business, according to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC), showed a 10th consecutive annual loss.</p> <p>A year later, after filing a \u00a326m loss in the UK, Starbucks' chief executive, Howard Schultz, told investors the business here was so successful he planned to apply the lessons to the company's biggest market in the US.</p> <p>Chief financial officer, Troy Alstead, called the UK business \"profitable\" in 2009 after accounts revealed a record \u00a352m loss. Last year, John Culver, the president of Starbucks international division, said: \"We are very pleased with the performance in the UK.\" Accounts reported a \u00a333m loss.</p> <p>Michael Meacher, the Labour MP for Oldham West and Royton, who has campaigned against companies that use tax avoidance techniques, said: \"HMRC should be having a look at this, especially since they keep saying there should be a crackdown. This has been going on for years and there are many companies involved.</p> <p>\"The fact they have paid 0.3% tax on their turnover is utterly scandalous. If they didn't think they could get away with it, they wouldn't dare do it.\"</p> <p>HMRC said: \"For legal reasons, we cannot comment on the tax affairs of individual businesses, but we make sure that multinationals pay the right tax to the UK in accordance with UK tax law.</p> <p>\"Our tax rules combat tax avoidance and we employ specialist tax professionals to ensure that multinationals play by the rules.\"</p> <p>Anna Walker, a spokesperson for UK Uncut, which attempts to highlight companies that fail to pay their fair share of tax, called on the government to change the law to stop what she called \"unfair and unjust behaviour\", adding that the organisation had Starbucks \"in its sights\".</p> <p>She said: \"The government must take action so that this country has a fair tax system ensuring that hugely profitable companies like Starbucks pay the right amount of tax.\"</p> <p>There is no suggestion Starbucks has broken the law and the company's worldwide tax rate was 31% last year, compared with an average of 18.5% for multinationals. However, it paid an average of 13% on overseas income, one of the lowest rates in the consumer goods sector.</p> <p>Starbucks said: \"We have paid and will continue to pay our fair share of taxes in full compliance with all UK tax laws, as we always have. There has been no suggestion by any authority that we are anything but compliant and good taxpayers.</p> <p>\"We do this in a way that is consistent with the values that have guided us since we were founded more than 40 years ago: balancing our need to operate a profitable business with a social conscience.\"</p>",
  "<p>I write as the father of a young man who has struggled with heroin, and, from speaking openly with him and his friends, I can vouch that the report by the UK Drug Policy Commission (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/15/decriminalise-drug-use-say-experts\" title=\"\">Decriminalise drug use, say experts after six-year study</a>, 15 October) accurately reflects the reality among our youngsters. The tragedy is that our legislators have no idea what is going on and show no inclination to inform themselves.</p> <p>My wife and I are a professional couple who brought up two children in a loving and caring way, but were no more able to prevent their enticement into the use of recreational drugs at school than we were able to stop them experimenting with cigarettes and alcohol, neither of which is any less harmful or addictive than ecstasy, cannabis or benzodiazepines.</p> <p>These drugs have become part of the culture of current and future generations of young adults, and they use them because \"Frankly, Dad, it's bloody good fun\". Our son was highly productive, vigorous and unaffected by the occasional use of non-addictive party drugs. His mistake was to experiment with heroin. It nearly ended his life, but with courage and support he managed to detoxify himself and rejoin society with energy and optimism, still using the party drugs.</p> <p>The report clearly distinguishes between party drugs and hard drugs, and this distinction is embedded in the common culture: the use of hard drugs is frowned upon, but because of the sordid way youngsters have to procure the softer ones, they are constantly faced with temptation. We must learn to accept widespread use of the less dangerous chemicals just as we accept moderate use of alcohol, while still reviling drugs like cocaine and the opiates. Emphasising the difference by decriminalising the \"safer\" drugs is far preferable to perpetuating a situation that is self-evidently bankrupt.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>\u2022\u2008In this age of austerity, when every penny of public spending must be justified, it is astonishing that the government seems content to squander \u00a33bn a year on its flawed drugs policy. The <a href=\"http://www.ukdpc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Drug Policy Commission</a> is one of a number of respected organisations, including the <a href=\"http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/\" title=\"\">Global Commission on Drug Policy</a>, to call for a rethink. There is growing agreement across the scientific, police and legal professions that we need to move away from prohibition of personal use towards an evidence-based, public health approach.</p> <p>There are also signs of a shift in public opinion. In a <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/4416608/.html\" title=\"\">YouGov poll for the Sun</a>, six out of 10 people said they would back trials in which users escape prosecution, but get better medical treatment. More than half wanted all drugs policy options to be reviewed, while more people said they believe crime levels will fall if cannabis use is decriminalised.</p> <p>Politicians need to recognise that the war on drugs has failed. The government should review the 1971 <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/38/contents\" title=\"\">Misuse of Drugs Act</a>, with a full cost-benefit analysis and impact assessment to compare its effectiveness in reducing the societal, economic and health costs of drug misuse with alternative approaches.</p> <p>We need a drugs policy based on evidence about what reduces harms, rather than one driven by moral judgments. Only then can we hope to improve the treatment of addiction, prevent drug-related crime and protect communities from the worst effects of drug&#xa0;misuse.<br><strong>Caroline Lucas MP</strong><br><em>Green, Brighton Pavilion; member of the all-party group for drug policy reform</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Illegal status adds to the dangers of drug taking. Instead of buying a joint from a safe outlet, where the toxicity can be monitored, a person who wants to smoke cannabis has to take to the streets and buy it from a dealer, who suggests he or she instead tries ecstasy, crack cocaine, or heroin. Purity of cocaine in the UK has fallen steeply as suppliers cut the drugs with other substances. And several people in the UK have died from a single dose of bacterially infected heroin. Regulation could control the process and greatly reduce the dangers of impure drugs.</p> <p>Then there is the bloody chain back to the original supplier. Countries such as Afghanistan, Colombia and Jamaica have had their economies destabilised by the illegal market while bribery, corruption and conflict have ruled.</p> <p>In the UK we have cut off huge swaths of the population, branding them criminals and creating an underclass who no longer feel part of our society. A sensible policy of regulation and control would reduce burglary, cut gun crime, clear out our overflowing prisons, and raise billions in tax revenues. Drug users could buy from places where they could be sure the drugs had not been cut with dangerous, cost-saving chemicals. There would be clear information about the risks involved and guidance on how to seek treatment. It is time to allow adults the freedom to make decisions about the harmful substances they consume.<br><strong>Dr Kailash Chand</strong><br><em>Stalybridge, Cheshire</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Overall prevalence of drug misuse may not be increased by the proposed decriminalisation of drug possession, but what about the effect on particular vulnerable groups? Will consumption rise in children, and disadvantaged children be particularly affected by the drug use of those around them? What about those suffering from mental disorders? Such people already suffer more than averagely from the malign effects of tobacco and alcohol, and the same seems likely with other substances. The commission should look at the effects across a range of social groups before making such an \"evidence-based\" recommendation. <br><strong>Dr Ben Lucas</strong><br><em>Consultant psychiatrist, London</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008The UK Drug Policy Commission should have gone the whole hog and suggested putting heroin on prescription, as it was until the late 60s. This would give addicts clean, uncut heroin; decriminalise possession; enable users to stabilise their habits; save vast amounts of NHS and prison expenditure; and put the pushers and drug barons out of business. But governments have never been any good at an evidence-based approach in the face of Daily Mail fury.<br><strong>Fr Julian Dunn</strong><br><em>Great Haseley, Oxfordshire</em></p>",
  "<p>The Commons had its first chance to discuss the revelations of appalling behaviour of a once highly respected and admired public figure, whose name has over the past few weeks become synonymous with abuse.</p> <p>MPs also talked about Jimmy Savile. But there are no votes in his crimes, so they were happy \u2013 at least Labour MPs were happy \u2013 to talk about Andrew Mitchell first.</p> <p>The chief whip, who is due to account for himself to leaders of the Tories' 1922 Committee, sat in his place at the end of the front bench. He looked, if that is possible, even more like a very stern codfish who has been on the slab for too long. For most of the time he stared straight ahead while various Home Office ministers sort of defended him.</p> <p>Labour MPs were performing a delicate balancing act. They want to remind the voters about what Mr Mitchell may or may not have shouted at the police as often as possible. In the jargon, it fits in with their \"narrative\", which is that the government is composed of arrogant toffs (another word, like \"pleb\" which you almost never hear in real life) who despise mere public servants.</p> <p>At the same time, they want him to stay, a permanent reminder of the narrative, a sort of \"memento toffee\" as the Roman plebs might have said.</p> <p>At first the job of reviling Mr Mitchell was left to backbenchers \u2013 all female, for some reason that eludes me.</p> <p>Catherine McKinnell asked what the effect would be on police morale of a \"cabinet minister verbally abusing\" officers. Damian Green said crisply that Mr Mitchell had apologised to the officer, the officer had accepted it, \"and for most people that would be enough\".</p> <p>Barbara Keeley chipped in. She accused the chief whip of \"ranting and raving.\" Theresa May, the home secretary, said that this matter had been dealt with, \"and that is an end to it.\" This fell somewhat short of a stout defence, and a look of slight anxiety crossed Mr Mitchell's fishy face, as if he had spotted a waiter arriving with a jug of Mornay sauce.</p> <p>At this stage we assumed that Labour was leaving the job to the troops while the officers kept quiet. But suddenly Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, was up, quoting Theresa May back at her. She had told the Police Federation that she believed the public should always give them the respect they deserved. Her implication was clear.</p> <p>\"I have already answered that question,\" said Mrs May. \"No you haven't!\" Labour members bellowed back. Seema Malhotra said that in her constituency people were arrested for abusing the police. Did this mean a different law applied in Whitehall?</p> <p>\"No,\" said Mrs May, looking increasingly unhappy.</p> <p>The session ended and Mr Mitchell disappeared. We were on to Jimmy Savile. Whatever you think about his loathsome attacks, there is something faintly distasteful about the hunting mentality of some MPs. They want him stripped of his knighthood and OBE, even though those died with him. I half-expected someone to demand that the wretched man be dug up so that furious crowds could tear to pieces whatever is left of him.</p>",

  "<p>Alex Salmond has signalled the start of a two-year campaign to persuade the Scottish electorate to embrace independence, after agreeing a referendum deal with David Cameron.</p> <p>After more than eight months of intense negotiations, the Scottish first minister and the UK prime minister signed a detailed 30-clause agreement in Edinburgh to stage a referendum before the end of 2014 asking a simple yes or no question on whether Scotland should become independent.</p> <p>The deal, dubbed the Edinburgh agreement by Salmond, states that both governments \"look forward to a referendum that is legal and fair producing a decisive and respected outcome\". The leaders said they would respect and uphold the result.</p> <p>The Scottish National party leader said the deal, agreed less than 18 months after he won a landslide victory to take control of the Scottish parliament, \"paves the way for the most important decision that our country, Scotland, has made in several hundred years. It is in that sense an historic day for Scotland, a major step forward in Scotland's home rule journey\".</p> <p>Salmond said he believed \"heart and soul\" he could win the referendum but, in a rare admission about the scale of the task facing his government and the Yes Scotland campaign, he acknowledged he still needed to persuade a majority of the country's 4 million voters to back independence.</p> <p>Although the SNP remains the most popular party for voters in Holyrood opinion polls, a Comres/ITV News poll published on Monday found that a majority of Scots (55%) opposed independence, with just over a third (34%) in favour.</p> <p>Salmond referred several times to the quest for home rule as being a \"journey\", a phrase many observers and critics will see as a tacit admission that he fears the SNP may be defeated and instead have to accept greater devolution to Scotland within the UK. Significantly, the phrase \"home rule\" has been most commonly used to refer to devolution, not to outright independence.</p> <p>\"Given the proper opportunity, we \u2013 the campaign, the SNP, the other parties supporting it, the civic Scotland people supporting this campaign \u2013 will be able to convince a majority of our fellow citizens that this is the right future for Scotland,\" Salmond said.</p> <p>The yes campaign would put forward a \"positive, ambitious vision for a flourishing, fairer, progressive, independent Scotland\".</p> <p>Using noticeably cautious language, he said \"if the campaign is pitched correctly and positively about the future of this country\", then it would win the referendum.</p> <p>\"Just as I have believed in independence all my life, I believe in that heart and soul,\" he said.</p> <p>Immediately after signing the document alongside the Scottish secretary, Michael Moore, and Salmond's deputy, Nicola Sturgeon, Cameron left St Andrew's House, the Scottish government's administrative headquarters in central Edinburgh, without a word to the waiting media.</p> <p>With access to and from the building very tightly controlled, and the street outside the building closed to all traffic, the muted atmosphere belied the occasion. Apart from a lone shout from one nationalist of \"vote yes for independence, Mr Cameron\" as the prime minister arrived to meet Salmond at 12.20pm, there were no demonstrations by either supporters or opponents of independence.</p> <p>In a series of television interviews, Cameron said he had delivered on his promises to Salmond and Scottish voters to give the Scottish parliament in Holyrood the legal right to stage a vote on independence.</p> <p>He said he would fight vigorously to keep Scotland a full part of the UK. \"This is an important day for the United Kingdom, but you can't haul the country of the United Kingdom against the will of its people. Scotland voted for a party that wanted to hold a referendum,\" he said. \"I want to be the prime minister that keeps the United Kingdom together, but I believe in showing respect to people in Scotland.</p> <p>\"The people of Scotland voted for a party that wanted to have a referendum on independence. I've made sure, showing them respect, that we can have that referendum in a way that is decisive, that is legal, that is fair but crucially is one single simple question, whether Scotland wants to stay in the United Kingdom or go.\"</p> <p>Cameron had earlier visited a military warship dockyard at Rosyth, Fife, where engineers are assembling the first of the Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers \u2013 a site chosen for its symbolism.</p> <p>Downing Street believes the UK government achieved a strategic success in forcing Salmond to drop demands for the Scottish parliament to be allowed to stage a two-question referendum, including an extra option of greater devolution within the UK.</p> <p>In exchange, Salmond will be allowed to hold the referendum in 2014, a year later than No 10 had originally hoped, and 16- and 17-year-olds will be given the right to vote. \"All that mattered was the question \u2013 everything else was marginal,\" one UK government source said.</p> <p>That was heavily criticised by one of Scotland's leading supporters of a second option, Martin Sime, chief executive of the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations. \"A strong majority of people want more powers short of independence but the referendum will deny them the chance to vote for the kind of change they want to see,\" Sime said. \"The politicians are back in charge and now we have two years of yes/no politics ahead of us whilst savage welfare cuts affect the poorest people across Scotland. This is not a recipe for successful democracy.\"</p> <p>Salmond said he regretted losing that debateand blamed the hard-headedness of the UK government, but said compromise was in the nature of all negotiations. That meant, however, that his government had been able to make \"significant gains\" by achieving a legally watertight referendum that would deliver a fair and decisive outcome.</p> <p>Many observers believe that Salmond was extremely keen to stage a two-option referendum because he believes winning a yes/no vote on independence will prove much harder.</p> <p>\"It's quite true that we didn't deliver that objective, of allowing the Scottish parliament to have a provision including the question of whether there should be one or two questions. But in terms of any negotiations, there has to be an element of compromise,\" Salmond said. \"I can understand why people might have wished to have a second question on the ballot paper but it was not an agreement foreclosed on by us; it was foreclosed on by the Westminster government.\"</p> <p>As widely expected, the deal will give the Scottish parliament the temporary legal power to stage a single-question referendum on Scottish independence until the end of 2014. The wording of the question, campaign financing and the designating which groups and parties can officially take part in the campaign will be overseen by the UK Electoral Commission under UK referendum law.</p> <p>The referendum is widely tipped to be held in October 2014, and Salmond confirmed he had a date in mind, but refused to disclose it, adding to expectations that disclosure may be the centrepiece of his keynote speech to the Scottish National party's annual conference in Perth this Saturday.</p> <p>The 30-clause agreement also confirms the Scottish parliament has the authority to widen the franchise to 16- and 17-year-olds, a measure Cameron had opposed. And in further concessions, the Scottish parliament will be allowed to ignore UK election rules that allow the Electoral Commission to oversee the conduct of the referendum, announcing the result and giving public grants to campaign organisations \u2013 a provision the Scottish government has resisted.</p> <p>After disagreements over how long the final official campaign in 2014 would last, the agreement has confirmed it will last 16 weeks.</p> <h2>Timeline</h2> <p><strong>22 October 2012 </strong>A section 30 order formally but temporarily transferring the power to hold an independence referendum will be laid in Westminster, as the Scottish government publishes its long-delayed report on the 24,000 public responses to its referendum consultation.</p> <p><strong>February 2013 </strong>The section 30 order, which amends the Scotland Act 1998 that originally set up the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh, will be agreed by the Privy Council in London, formally conferring that temporary power to stage the referendum to Holyrood.</p> <p><strong>Spring 2013 </strong>The Scottish government will present a referendum bill to Holyrood, setting out the question, putting limits on campaign spending and confirming whether 16- and 17-year-olds will be allowed to vote.</p> <p><strong>November 2013 </strong>After a final vote expected in October 2013, the Queen is expected to give royal assent to the referendum bill. The Scottish government will publish a white paper finally detailing its \"prospectus for independence\", setting out the Scottish National party's vision for an independent Scotland.</p> <p><strong>June 2014 </strong>The final 16-week referendum campaign is expected to start, when both pro-independence and pro-UK campaigns will intensify.</p> <p><strong>Autumn 2014 </strong>The Scottish independence referendum takes place, probably in October.

  "<p>What are your views on ED Hirsch? Never heard of him? If so, you're in good company: only a small number of people in the UK have. But you might be well advised to look Hirsch up \u2013 his philosophy could be coming to a primary school near you, very soon.</p> <p>Hirschism, if there is such a thing, is spreading fast through the English school system. Two proposed new primary free schools \u2013 the West London free school, backed by journalist Toby Young, and the Pimlico Academy primary \u2013 are planning to base their lessons on it. A new curriculum centre is devoting its efforts to promoting it, and a right-leaning thinktank is publishing a series of how-to guides on it for teachers.</p> <p>Moreover, a new primary curriculum \u2013 due to be implemented in 2014 \u2013 has Hirsch at its heart. Both Michael Gove, the education secretary, and Nick Gibb, until recently his schools minister, and architect of a major review of the curriculum, have been profoundly impressed by his ideas.</p> <p>So who is ED Hirsch? What does he believe? And how on earth did he manage to influence the way children across England will learn \u2013 without even being aware he was doing so?</p> <p>Eric Donald Hirsch Junior is an 84-year-old retired professor \u2013 originally of English literature \u2013 from Virginia. He began his career as a professor at Yale, specialising in the Romantic poets. But by the 1970s, he was teaching at the University of Virginia, conducting research on reading with young people at local community colleges. He was shocked to discover those from poorer backgrounds struggled to read a passage on the surrender of General Robert E Lee near their home town of Richmond \u2013 because they lacked the necessary background knowledge of the American Civil War.</p> <p>The result was a hugely influential book, first published in 1983, on what he calls Cultural Literacy. In it Hirsch argued that all American children needed a body of \"core knowledge\" which would allow them to function as fully rounded citizens \u2013 and that, as some were not absorbing this knowledge at home, they needed to be taught it at school. He even added an appendix, with long lists of facts, words and phrases whose significance every US child should know: the Adirondack Mountains; the Alamo; Alaska; the Founding Fathers.</p> <p>In the ensuing years \u2013 during which Hirsch was greeted by the American right as a prophet and a saviour, and by the left as a scion of the empire of evil \u2013 these ideas solidified. Hirsch published a series of further works, which argued that children not only needed a clear body of factual knowledge but that they should also learn that knowledge in a very highly structured way \u2013 starting with basics and building up, rather than taking a more thematic approach.</p> <p>Hirsch's position as an influential figure in American education has long been established \u2013 he set up a body called the Core Knowledge Foundation, which has spread his philosophy across the States \u2013 but how did he come to be influential here?</p> <p>Several years ago, Nick Gibb \u2013 then shadow minister for schools \u2013 came across Hirsch and began reading his books. As long ago as 2008 he told fellow MPs they should read Hirsch for insight into an \"anti-knowledge ideology\" which, he said, was rife in American and English schools. The problem, he said, was that the education establishment had its roots in a romantic ideology that said skills, rather than knowledge, were the key to learning.</p> <p>Michael Gove, too, has spoken of his admiration for Hirsch, citing him in 2009 in a speech to the Royal Society of Arts. \"A society in which there is a widespread understanding of the nation's past, a shared appreciation of cultural reference points, a common stock of knowledge on which all can draw, and trade, is a society in which we all understand each other better,\" he added.</p> <p>Soon afterwards the thinktank Civitas began translating Hirsch's views into practical guides for English schools: What Your Year 1 Child Needs to Know, for instance, provides a comprehensive guide for teachers. Its index reads very much like an English version of Hirsch's lists of what American children should learn, with Hans Christian Anderson, the Angel of the North and the English Civil War replacing the basic touchstones of US \"cultural literacy\".</p> <p>Since Civitas took up the cause, two proposed free schools have announced they plan to teach using Hirsch's methods. And a new curriculum centre has been set up, using funds from wealthy benefactors, to spread the ideas further.</p> <p>Toby Young, who is planning to follow such a knowledge-based curriculum at his new primary free school in west London, wrote on the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2012/oct/03/free-schools-research-development-education\" title=\"\">Teacher Network</a> recently that more subjects would be taught by specialists and the aim was to raise attainment \"particularly among children from deprived backgrounds\".</p> <p>When the government announced the initial outcome of its curriculum review \u2013 designed to overhaul and slim down what schools must teach \u2013 at the end of last year, Hirsch was writ large across it. \"The new national curriculum will set out only the essential knowledge that all children should acquire,\" runs the Department for Education website introduction to new draft programmes of study for primary maths, English and science. The drafts are \"very specific about the content to be covered, given the fundamental importance of these subjects as a foundation for further study and as the basis for our system of school accountability,\" it adds.</p> <p>Perhaps it was hardly surprising that some members of the expert panel set up to advise on the new curriculum were less than pleased. The panel had proposed broad, two-year blocks of learning which would give teachers freedom to decide what to teach and when. But the published programmes were detailed and far more prescriptive. Professor Andrew Pollard, who was a member of the panel, stepped down as a result.</p> <p>Ministers have shown \"a cavalier disregard\" for research evidence from the UK and elsewhere, he says. All the best evidence shows that it is excellent teaching rather than curriculum reform that raises standards, he points out. Countries such as Singapore and Finland \u2013 often cited by ministers as beacons of excellence \u2013 recruit the most able graduates as teachers and give them time and freedom to develop their skills.</p> <p>\"Ministers have a responsibility to do no harm and there is some risk that what they're proposing will actually reduce the quality of learning and reduce the breadth of education that's available in primary schools,\" he says. \"Despite the rhetoric about opportunities, it's quite possible that what is proposed will increase inequality and the disadvantaged will become more disadvantaged.\"</p> <p>Gibb, who arrives for an interview on the subject bearing a little pile of Hirsch's works adorned with yellow Post-it notes, is unrepentant. \"All the evidence from around the world is that the more autonomy professionals have, the higher the standards. But, in order to do that, you have to have a curriculum that sets out the key things, the core academic knowledge in those core academic subjects \u2013 maths, English, science in particular \u2013 that children need to learn,\" he says.</p> <p>He is confident his Hirschian curriculum will survive his departure from office in the September reshuffle: \"The work has been done. It's out for consultation. I know the secretary of state is pleased with the product. I think he broadly accepts this approach, so I think that will remain,\" he says.</p> <p>\"At every stage, as we've drafted the primary curriculum, he [Gove] has been deeply engaged in it. He has his own views and they have not differed from my view.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the man himself seems blissfully aware of the waves he has been making.</p> <p>\"Oh, I did not know that. How interesting!\" he exclaims after being told education ministers in the UK have seized on his idea of \"cultural literacy\". He had a brief email exchange with Gibb a few years ago but apart from that there has been no contact between them, he says. But he is delighted to learn his ideas have spread across the Atlantic.</p> <p>\"I'm very gratified, particularly if in fact it has some positive effect in England. That would be terrific. I'm surprised and I'm gratified.\"</p> <p>Fran Abrams will discuss the influence of ED Hirsch on BBC Radio 4's Analysis programme at 8.30pm on Monday 22 October</p> <h2>10 things every year-1 child should know <br> </h2> <p>Acorns</p> <p>Brer Rabbit tales</p> <p>Continents</p> <p>English Civil War</p> <p>Jungles</p> <p>Machu Picchu</p> <p>Mexico</p> <p>AA Milne</p> <p>Musical pitch</p> <p>Henry Moore</p> <h2>10 things every year-2 child should know <br></h2> <p>Tap dancing</p> <p>Louis Pasteur</p> <p>Rabies</p> <p>Mosques</p> <p>Hansel and Gretel</p> <p>Atlantic Ocean</p> <p>Extinct animals and fish</p> <p>Great Wall of China</p> <p>Dinosaur bones</p> <p>Roald Amundsen</p> <p>\u2022 From Civitas's English 'translation' of ED Hirsch's guide for schools</p>",
  "<p>This column is normally accompanied by a photo; an illustration that takes its cue from the text. But not today. The chart you see on this page is plainly not decorative: it is the main event. All I'm going to discuss is its implications.</p> <p>Drawing on IMF figures published last week, the graph compares what will happen to government spending in Britain up to 2017 with the outlook for Germany and the US. And what it shows is that the UK will plunge from public spending on a par with Germany in 2009, to spending less than the US by 2017. Had France, Sweden or Canada been included on this graph, the UK would still come bottom. If George Osborne gets his way, within the next five years, Britain will have a smaller public sector than any other major developed nation.</p> <p>Fan or critic, nearly everyone now agrees that this government wants to shrink the state, but very few take on board what that means. This graph shows just how radical those ministerial plans are. Particularly striking is the fact that Britain will end up spending less as a proportion of its national income than even the US, the international byword for a decrepit public sector. According to <a href=\"http://www.kent.ac.uk/sspssr/staff/academic/taylorgooby.html\" title=\"\">Peter Taylor-Gooby, professor of social policy at Kent</a>, this will be the first time it has happened since at least 1980 and possibly in recorded history. For it to take place within half a decade is a shift so dramatic that few people in frontline politics, let alone among the electorate, have understood its implications.</p> <p>Forget all that ministerial guff about the necessity of cutting the public sector to spur economic growth. Had that argument been true, British businesses would be in leonine form by now, instead of their current chronic enfeeblement. It was notable at last week's Tory party conference how Osborne and David Cameron didn't even try to argue for the economic benefits of austerity \u2013 how could they? \u2013 but grimly asserted that there was no alternative.</p> <p>Forget, too, the argument that only cuts have kept Britain's borrowing costs from rocketing. In the IMF's <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2012/pn1281.htm\" title=\"\">summer healthcheck</a> for the UK was another chart which showed that the only nations where interest rates had spiralled upwards were those in the eurozone, and those without control of their own currency and monetary policy. Every other major economy, no matter what their debt load, was able to borrow from the financial markets as cheaply as ever.</p> <p>Strip away the usual economic and financial alibis for such drastic austerity and what you're inevitably left with is a purely political motive: namely, a desire to transform the British state from being recognisably European, with continental levels of public spending, to something sub-American in its miserliness.</p> <p>Let me make two caveats. First, there was no way Britain was going to maintain public spending at 2009 levels. That year, the Labour government threw the kitchen sink at the economy, after which you would expect some belt-tightening. Still, as <a href=\"http://www.ifs.org.uk/people/profile/2\" title=\"\">Carl Emmerson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies</a> points out, after both world wars, the level of public spending in Britain rose permanently; you might expect something similar after a once-in-a-lifetime financial crisis. Given how fast Britain is ageing, and how much we will need to spend on pensions and care for the elderly, there is no reason why the state in Britain should shrink back to some magic level of 40% of the economy.</p> <p>Second, this chart is based on current US budget plans: if Mitt Romney moves into the White House next January, or even if Barack Obama is re-elected and has to strike a bargain with intransigent Republicans, then Washington is also likely to make stringent cuts. But that last qualification only reinforces the larger argument. Whether in Britain or the US, the right are trying to whip the rest of us into a giant race to the bottom, where public services, welfare entitlements and employment rights are all to be tossed overboard.</p> <p>Cameron admitted as much in last Wednesday's conference speech. Lumping together Nigeria with China and India and Brazil, he described them as \"the countries on the rise \u2026 lean, fit, obsessed with enterprise, spending money on the future \u2013 on education, incredible infrastructure and technology\". As anyone who has ever tried to keep a car on the potholed roads of Bihar, in northern India, will know, that description is a giant porky. But Cameron wanted to draw a comparison with \"the countries on the slide \u2026 fat, sclerotic, over-regulated, spending money on unaffordable welfare systems, huge pension bills, unreformed public services\".</p> <p>From compassionate Conservative to growth rainmaker to state-shrinker, Cameron has gone through a huge change since 2005. But that is nothing like what lies ahead for the rest of Britain in the next five years. Prepare yourself for welfare to be downsized into American-style workfare, for public-sector jobs to be turned into a second-class employment and for services, from school to healthcare, to demand that users pay more to get something decent. The future is American.</p>",
  "<p>If you see a scientist wandering through St Pancras station looking a bit green, don't assume they've had a dodgy crossing on Eurostar. It's probably jealousy. Work is under way just outside to build <a href=\"http://www.crick.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">the Francis Crick Institute</a>: a research behemoth that looks set to project three London universities into the global superleague for biomedicine. The site will not be ready until 2015, but already the building is casting a big shadow over the rest of the country.</p> <p>The Crick, as it is known in academia, is intended to develop better treatments for diseases by bringing together scientists from different disciplines to study everything from stem cells to influenza. It is also a thundering testament to the power of partnership.</p> <p>The \u00a3630m project brings together University College London, King's College and Imperial College, with investment from three of the biggest public funders in this area. It has had the domino effect of putting considerable pressure on universities outside the capital to form alliances in order to stand a chance of competing. The standard refrain from other vice-chancellors is \"even Oxbridge are terrified of the Crick\".</p> <p>Professor Sir Steve Smith, vice-chancellor of Exeter University, explains: \"Throughout the world concentration of research funding is the name of the game, therefore for the country the Crick is the right solution. But what does that mean for universities outside the south-east? How can you possibly compete as a single institution, whoever you are?\"</p> <p>Arranging marriages between universities is no small task, not least because the game-changing Research Excellence Framework, which will distribute more than a billion pounds of government research cash to universities a year, pits institutions against each other and fuels a climate of intense rivalry. This is further ingrained by the international obsession with league tables. Professor Robert Lechler, vice-president for health at King's College and one of the architects of the Crick partnership deal, is frustrated with these barriers. \"For the first time ever London is seriously at risk of getting its act together, with a real readiness to engage in partnership work, which is incredibly exciting. But there is no real financial incentive. The REF breeds inter-institutional competition when we need collaboration.\"</p> <p>According to insiders, the Crick university union was a long way from love at first sight. The institute was originally intended to be a much smaller-scale merger with the National Institute for Medical Research, and the big London research universities entered a furious competition to win the contract. UCL came out on top as the exclusive partner in 2006. When the original plan ballooned, and King's College and Imperial began campaigning to be included, UCL was reportedly less than enthusiastic about having other institutions muscling in.</p> <p>Lechler is not keen to talk about this troubled courtship. \"At the end of the day it is about trading autonomy for success, and I think we are ready to do that,\" he says. He is determined to move away from the culture of automatic rivalry \u2013 at least within London. \"We've all got a history of poaching and in the run up to the REF it's like the football transfer market,\" he admits. \"However, I have reached the point where if it's an inter-London institutional transfer I question whether there is sufficient reason for them to move. Or could it be a joint appointment?\"</p> <p>However, Sarah Jackson, director of <a href=\"http://www.n8research.org.uk/\" title=\"\">the N8</a>, a partnership between eight big-hitting research universities in the north, including Manchester, Durham and Leeds, is pragmatic about what is achievable. \"You have to acknowledge the reality that this is a very competitive sector, and you won't change that,\" she says. \"Our institutions collaborate in some areas \u2014 where it makes sense \u2014 and compete in others. We are comfortable with that.\"</p> <p>The N8 has had some major successes, including research council funding for a \u00a33.2m high-performance computing centre. Sharing expensive new research equipment has become a key driver for the group, especially since the government slashed capital funding last year. The N8 model is now regarded in government circles as something worth emulating \u2014 but this hasn't happened overnight. Jackson says: \"Partnership takes time to build. You can't write trust into a contract. It has taken us five years to build a relationship where the pro vice-chancellors can be totally honest with me and with each other.\"</p> <p>This is a cautionary message for the M5 partnership, which sprang up earlier this year involving five research universities from the middle of the country, including Birmingham and Lancaster.</p> <p>Until recently Lancaster was planning a major \"federal\" partnership with Liverpool University, but this has been dropped. The official line was that \"transformational benefits\" couldn't be achieved right now. But sources close to the process say the deal collapsed largely because of opposition from staff. As one academic notes: \"It's not a command and control situation. You've got to bring everyone with you.\"</p> <p>Lancaster is continuing to pursue other partnership options, and strikingly its vice-chancellor, Professor Mark Smith, suggested in a recent internal management meeting that Lancaster might consider becoming \"the junior partner\" with a world leading university. This highlights one of the key dilemmas of big university partnerships: someone will inevitably come out on top, and it may not be your institution. As Steve Smith says: \"The issue isn't really money \u2013 it's kudos. If you put in a joint REF submission, for example, how do you divide the credit? How do you convey this to the international league tables? These things worry vice-chancellors.\"</p> <p>The N8 computing centre is a case in point. It is physically based at Leeds, so much of the credit will gravitate there, although Manchester officially won the grant. Luke Georghiou, vice-president for research at Manchester, says: \"There is an element of kudos attached to big equipment and you have to learn to accept that.\"</p> <p>Egos may become less ruffled when a partnership happens across countries. Warwick University has teamed up with Monash University in Melbourne. The deal was three years in the making, while the two leadership teams hammered out issues such as credit sharing and what their priorities should be. But the institutions appointed a joint pro vice-chancellor last month \u2013 something Warwick vice-chancellor Professor Nigel Thrift admits would have been harder to pull off with a partner in his own back yard. \"It wasn't the main reason for choosing Monash, but it does take the pressure off,\" he says. \"You aren't competing in the same arena and that certainly helps.\"</p>",
  "<p>In orthodox economics, growth is good. At Davos this year, 35 sessions dealt with how to encourage more of it. \"Relentless focus on growth,\" said David Cameron in 2010, \"is what you will get from this government.\" The more money spent, the more money made \u2013 goes the argument \u2013 and the more money that can be spent again. By contrast, if people stop spending, firms stop making money, and their employees start losing their jobs. In short, growth defines progress.</p> <p>To suggest otherwise, says <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/tim_jackson_s_economic_reality_check.html\" title=\"\">economics professor Tim Jackson</a>, was once \"like arguing that you wanted to sell your grandmother\". But in May 2011, the 2,500 delegates at Berlin's Beyond Growth conference did just that. Influenced by the likes of <a href=\"http://steadystate.org/eight-fallacies-about-growth/\" title=\"\">Herman Daly</a>, conference-goers argued that growth was a useless way of achieving prosperity. Growth simply depends on economic activity \u2013 \"and a lot of that activity,\" says one of the attendees, freelance <a href=\"http://www.feasta.org/2011/06/10/what-could-a-post-growth-society-look-like-and-how-should-we-prepare-for-it/\" title=\"\">economist Brian Davey</a>, \"isn't necessarily very useful\".</p> <p>Buying a gun contributes to growth, for example, but eventually it might also hurt someone. Buying petrol earns the vendor money, but depletes natural resources. As a result, growth can't go on for ever \u2013 the earth's resources are finite. Sustainable growth, they argue, is also a myth: it's impossible to decouple economic progress from environmental damage.</p> <p>It wasn't just eco-warriors saying this: \"There were some serious academics, NGOs, labour unions, Marxists, and also a lot of young, bright highly-motivated kids,\" remembers Jackson, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/23/properity-without-growth-tim-jackson\" title=\"\">author of Prosperity Without Growth</a>, and one of the academics present. Over 100 speakers outlined alternatives to growth \u2013 tactics that aimed to slow down economic activity while raising employment and people's quality of life. <a href=\"http://www.jenseits-des-wachstums.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Kampagnen/jenseits-des-wachstums/Textsammlung/program_BG_english.pdf\" title=\"\">Suggestions included</a> various forms of decentralisation; turning private land into commons to avoid its overuse; and sharing full-time jobs between part-time workers.</p> <p>\"This heretical idea of a no-growth future \u2013 it's no longer just possible,\" says Kalle Lasn, editor of <a href=\"http://www.adbusters.org/magazine\" title=\"Adbusters\">Adbusters</a> magazine, and author of <a href=\"http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781846146985,00.html\" title=\"Meme Wars\">Meme Wars</a>, an upcoming book about transcending growth. \"It's being discussed in a very workmanlike way.\" In 2007, Tim Jackson felt he couldn't even \"breathe the question. But what's interesting for me was that only three years later, thousands of people would turn out to ask exactly that question.\"</p>",
  "<p>Iran has been asked to persuade the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, to implement a ceasefire later this month in tandem with an appeal by the UN to halt the flow of weapons to both sides in the country's bloody conflict.</p> <p>Lakhdar Brahimi, the envoy for the UN and Arab League, used a weekend visit to Iran, a loyal ally of Damascus, to appeal for help in securing a ceasefire to mark Eid al-Adha, the four-day Muslim holiday later this month. In Baghdad on Monday he called on the Iraqi government to use its influence, while Nuri al-Maliki, the Iraqi prime minister, called for a speedy \"political solution\".</p> <p>Brahimi said a ceasefire would \"help create an environment that would allow a political process to develop\", said his spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi. But Fawzi denied a report that plans were afoot to send a 3,000-strong UN peacekeeping force to Syria, drawn from an existing UN contingent in south Lebanon.</p> <p>EU officials dismissed the idea as far-fetched, because it would first require a durable ceasefire and moves towards a political transition \u2014 both of which have proved elusive over the 19 months of the crisis.</p> <p>It is clearly being discussed, though. Qatar's prime minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem al Thani, said any such force would have to be \"well-armed\".</p> <p>The Syrian Network for Human Rights reported 69 people were killed in Syria on Monday, mostly in Damascus.</p> <p>Brahimi, who replaced Kofi Annan last month, was due to travel on to the Egyptian capital, Cairo, his latest stop on a regional tour aimed at forging a solution to a conflict which has claimed an estimated 30,000 lives. Last week, the Algerian diplomat met leaders in Saudi Arabia and Turkey, the two Sunni states which have been the biggest supporters of the Syrian opposition.</p> <p>Syria, meanwhile, denied it was using cluster bombs to crush the uprising. Human Rights Watch <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/14/syria-russian-cluster-bombs-claim\" title=\"\">accused it of using the banned weapons</a> and produced video evidence. Russia denied it had been supplying the munitions to Syria.</p> <p>In Luxembourg, EU foreign ministers announced a 19th round of sanctions to freeze the assets of two Syrian firms linked to chemical and biological weapons programmes and more than two dozen people from Assad's entourage.</p> <p>Britain's foreign secretary, William Hague, described the punitive measures as \"a clear warning to those close to the regime that if they back Assad and commit acts of violence and torture against civilians, the international community will hold them accountable\".</p> <p>Diplomats said one new element in the EU's approach was aid to \"civil society\" organisations on the ground inside Syria, part of a shift away from supporting the external opposition. The local co-ordination committees (LCCs) are likely to receive new help, especially in areas that are no longer under the permanent control of the Damascus government. It would, said Hague, \"help build essential capacity to enable a peaceful transition\". New announcements are expected shortly.</p> <p>In another development that highlighted the international complexity of the crisis, the New York Times reported that most weapons supplied to Syrian rebels by Qatar and Saudi Arabia were reaching jihadi-type or Salafi groups rather than the Free Syrian Army, which is backed by the mainstream opposition.</p> <p>A new report by the International Crisis Group, a respected thinktank, found that Syrian rebel groups were playing up their Islamist credentials by growing Salafi-type beards, for example, as a ruse to secure arms from these conservative Gulf-based donors. Groups with no ideological affiliation had begun to adopt the symbols, rhetoric \u2013 and facial hair \u2013 associated with Salafism for that purpose.</p>",

Kennedy's own judgment was that the probability of war might have been <a href=\"http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/10660-in-hiroshimas-shadow\">as high as 50%</a>. Estimates became higher as the confrontation reached its peak and the \"secret doomsday plan to ensure the survival of the government was put into effect\" in Washington, described by journalist Michael Dobbs in his <a href=\"http://www.michaeldobbsbooks.com/1/post/2012/08/cold-war-humor.html\">recent, well-researched bestseller</a> on the crisis \u2013 though he doesn't explain why there would be much point in doing so, given the likely nature of nuclear war. Dobbs quotes Dino Brugioni, \"a key member of the CIA team monitoring the Soviet missile build-up\", who saw no way out except \"war and complete destruction\" as the clock moved to One Minute to Midnight \u2013 Dobbs' title. Kennedy's close associate, historian Arthur Schlesinger, described the events as \"the most dangerous moment in human history\". Defense Secretary Robert McNamara wondered aloud whether he \"would live to see another Saturday night\", and later recognized that \"we lucked out\" \u2013 barely.</p> <p>A closer look at what took place adds grim overtones to these judgments, with reverberations to the present moment.</p> <h2>'The most dangerous moment'</h2> <p>There are several candidates for \"the most dangerous moment\". One is 27 October, when US destroyers enforcing the quarantine around Cuba were dropping depth-charges on Soviet submarines. According to Soviet accounts, reported by the <a href=\"http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB75/\">National Security Archive</a>, submarine commanders were \"rattled enough to talk about firing nuclear torpedoes, whose 15 kiloton explosive yields approximated the bomb that devastated Hiroshima in August 1945\".</p> <p>In one case, a reported decision to assemble a nuclear torpedo for battle readiness was aborted at the last minute by Second Captain Vasili Archipov, who may have saved the world from nuclear disaster. There is little doubt what the US reaction would have been had the torpedo been fired, or how the Russians would have responded as their country was going up in smoke. Kennedy had already declared the highest nuclear alert short of launch (Defcon 2), which authorized \"Nato aircraft with Turkish pilots ... [or others] ... to take off, fly to Moscow, and drop a bomb\", <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ftruth-out.org%2Fopinion%2Fitem%2F10660-in-hiroshimas-shadow&amp;ei=6op4UKX5Hcml0QX4g4C4CQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGCLwsylmQR4OW6dN5IDifm3V8Iig\">according to Harvard University strategic analyst Graham Allison</a>, in Foreign Affairs.</p> <p>Another candidate is the previous day, 26 October. That day is selected as \"the most dangerous moment\" by a B-52 pilot, Major Don Clawson, who piloted one of those Nato aircrafts and provides a hair-raising description of details of the Chrome Dome (CD) missions during the crisis, \"B-52s on airborne alert\" with nuclear weapons \"on board and ready to use\". 26 October was the day when \"the nation was closest to nuclear war,\" Clawson writes in his \"irreverent anecdotes of an Air Force pilot\", Is That Something the Crew Should Know? On that day, Clawson himself was in a good position to set off a likely terminal cataclysm. He concludes that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We were damned lucky we didn't blow up the world \u2013 and no thanks to the political or military leadership of this country.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The errors, confusions, near-accidents and miscomprehension of the leadership that Clawson reports are startling enough, but not as much as the operative command-and-control rules \u2013 or lack of them. As Clawson recounts his experiences during the 15, 24-hour CD missions he flew \u2013 the maximum possible \u2013 the official commanders \"did not possess the capability to prevent a rogue crew or crew-member from arming and releasing their thermonuclear weapons\", or even from broadcasting a mission that would have sent off \"the entire airborne alert force without possibility of recall\". Once the crew was airborne, carrying thermonuclear weapons, he writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It would have been possible to arm and drop them all with no further input from the ground. There was no inhibitor on any of the systems.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>About one-third of the total force was in the air, according to General David Burchinal, director of plans on the air staff at Air Force headquarters. The Strategic Air Command, technically in charge, appears to have had little control. And according to Clawson's account, the civilian National Command Authority was kept in the dark by SAC, which means that the ExComm \"deciders\" pondering the fate of the world knew even less. General Burchinal's oral history is no less hair-raising, and reveals even greater contempt for the civilian command. According to him, Russian capitulation was never in doubt. The CD operations were designed to make it crystal clear to the Russians that they were hardly even competing in the military confrontation, and could quickly have been destroyed.</p> <p>From the ExComm records, Stern concludes that on 26 October President Kennedy was \"leaning towards military action to eliminate the missiles\" in Cuba, to be followed by invasion, <a href=\"http://www.kentucky.com/2012/10/10/2366509/archives-to-recount-jfks-cuban.html\">according to Pentagon plans</a>. It was evident then that the act might have led to terminal war, a conclusion fortified much later by revelations that tactical nuclear weapons had been deployed, and that Russian forces were far greater than US intelligence had reported.</p> <p>As the ExComm meetings were drawing to a close at 6pm on the 26 October, a letter arrived from Prime Minister Khrushchev, directly to President Kennedy. Khrushchev's \"message seemed clear,\" Stern writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The missiles would be removed if the US promised not to invade Cuba.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The next day, at 10am, the president again turned on the secret tape. He read aloud a wire service report that had just been handed to him:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Premier Khrushchev told President Kennedy in a message today he would withdraw offensive weapons from Cuba if the United States withdrew its rockets from Turkey.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>These were Jupiter missiles with nuclear warheads. The report was soon authenticated. Though received by the committee as an unexpected bolt from the blue, it had actually been anticipated: \"We've known this might be coming for a week,\" Kennedy informed them. To refuse public acquiescence would be difficult, he realized. These were obsolete missiles, already slated for withdrawal, to be replaced by far more lethal and effectively invulnerable Polaris submarines. Kennedy recognized that he would be in an \"insupportable position if this becomes [Khrushchev's] proposal\", both because the Turkish missiles were useless and were being withdrawn anyway, and because \"it's gonna \u2013 to any man at the United Nations or any other rational man, it will look like a very fair trade.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397785051\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350324465025/Cuban-missile-crisis-defe-008.jpg\" alt=\"Cuban missile crisis defense department photo\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A photo released by the US Defense Department on 3 November 1962, illustrating a medium-range ballistic missile site at Sagua La Grande, Cuba. Photograph: AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>A serious dilemma</h2> <p>The planners therefore faced a serious dilemma: they had in hand two somewhat different proposals from Khrushchev to end the threat of catastrophic war, and each would seem to any \"rational man\" to be a fair trade. How then to react?</p> <p>One possibility would have been to breathe a sigh of relief that civilization could survive, to eagerly accept both offers and to announce that the US would adhere to international law and remove any threat to invade Cuba; and to carry forward the withdrawal of the obsolete missiles in Turkey, proceeding as planned to upgrade the nuclear threat against the Soviet Union to a far greater one, of course, only part of the global encirclement of Russia. But that was unthinkable.</p> <p>The basic reason why no such thought could be contemplated was spelled out by National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy, former Harvard Dean and reputedly the brightest star in the Camelot firmament. The <a href=\"http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/cuba_mis_cri/moment.htm\">world must come to understand</a> that \"the current threat to peace is not in Turkey, it is in Cuba,\" where missiles are directed against us. A vastly more powerful US missile force trained on the much weaker and more vulnerable Soviet enemy cannot possibly be regarded as a threat to peace, because we are Good, as a great many people in the western hemisphere and beyond could testify \u2013 among numerous others, the victims of the ongoing terrorist war that the US was then waging against Cuba, or those swept up in the \"campaign of hatred\" in the Arab world that so puzzled Eisenhower (though not the National Security Council, which explained it clearly).</p> <p>And, of course, the idea that the US should be restrained by international law was too ridiculous to merit consideration. As <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/11/07/362379/noam-chomsky-versus-me/\">explained recently by the respected liberal commentator Matthew Yglesias</a>, \"one of the main functions of the international institutional order is precisely to legitimate the use of deadly military force by western powers\" \u2013 meaning the US \u2013 so that it is \"amazingly na\u00efve\", indeed quite \"silly\", to suggest that the US should obey international law or other conditions that we impose on the powerless: a frank and welcome exposition of operative assumptions, reflexively taken for granted by the ExComm assemblage.</p> <p>In subsequent colloquy, the president stressed that we would be \"in a bad position\" if we chose to set off an international conflagration by rejecting proposals that would seem quite reasonable to survivors, if any cared. This \"pragmatic\" stance was about as far as moral considerations could reach. In a review of recently-released documents on Kennedy-era terror, Harvard University Latin Americanist <a href=\"http://cubajournal.blogspot.com/2010/09/operation-mongoose-us-sponsored.html\">Jorge Dom\u00ednguez observes</a> that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Only once in these nearly thousand pages of documentation did a US official raise something that resembled a faint moral objection to US government-sponsored terrorism.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>A member of the National Security Council staff suggested that raids that are \"haphazard and kill innocents \u2026 might mean a bad press in some friendly countries.\" The same attitudes prevail throughout the internal discussions during the missile crisis, as when Robert Kennedy warned that a full-scale invasion of Cuba would \"kill an awful lot of people, and we're going to take an awful lot of heat on it.\" And they prevail to the present with only the rarest of exceptions, as easily documented.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397785052\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350324764755/John-F-Kennedy-during-Cub-008.jpg\" alt=\"John F Kennedy during Cuban missile crisis, 1962\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US president John F Kennedy making his dramatic television broadcast to announce the Cuba blockade during the Cuban missile crisis, 22 October 1962.

It was only recently learned that, six months earlier, the US had secretly deployed in Okinawa missiles virtually identical to those the Russians later sent to Cuba. These were surely aimed at China, at a moment of elevated regional tensions. Okinawa remains a major offensive US military base, over the bitter objections of its inhabitants \u2013 who, right now, <a href=\"http://nation.time.com/2012/09/09/still-no-luck-for-the-v-22-in-japan/\">are less than enthusiastic about the dispatch of accident-prone V-22 Osprey helicopters</a> to the Fukenma military base, located at the heart of a heavily-populated urban center.</p> <p>In the deliberations that followed, the US pledged to withdraw the obsolete missiles from Turkey, but would not do so publicly or in writing: it was important that Khrushchev be seen to capitulate. An interesting reason was offered, and is accepted as reasonable by scholarship and commentary. As Dobbs puts it:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"If it appeared that the United States was dismantling the missile bases unilaterally, under pressure from the Soviet Union, the [Nato] alliance might crack.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Or, to rephrase a little more accurately, if the US replaced useless missiles with a far more lethal threat, as already planned, in a trade with Russia that any \"rational man\" would regard as very fair, then the Nato alliance might crack. To be sure, when Russia withdrew Cuba's only deterrent against ongoing US attack with a severe threat to proceed to direct invasion and quietly departed from the scene, the Cubans would be infuriated \u2013 as they were, understandably. But that is an unfair comparison for the standard reasons: we are human beings who matter, while they are merely \"unpeople\", to borrow Orwell's useful phrase.</p> <p>Kennedy also made an informal pledge not to invade Cuba, but with conditions: not just withdrawal of the missiles, but also termination, or at least \"a great lessening\", of any Russian military presence. (Unlike Turkey, on Russia's borders, where nothing of the kind could be contemplated.) When Cuba is no longer an \"armed camp\", then \"we probably wouldn't invade,\" in the president's words. He added also that if it hoped to be free from the threat of US invasion, Cuba must end its \"political subversion\" (Stern's phrase) in Latin America.</p> <p>Political subversion had been a constant theme for years, invoked, <a href=\"http://www.chomsky.info/articles/200412--.htm\">for example</a>, when Eisenhower overthrew the parliamentary government of Guatemala and plunged the tortured country into an abyss from which it has yet to emerge. And the themes remained alive and well right through Reagan's vicious terror wars in Central America in the 1980s. The \"political subversion\" consisted of support for those resisting the murderous assaults of the US and its client regimes, and sometimes \u2013 horror of horrors \u2013 perhaps even providing arms to the victims.</p> <h2>The problem with Castro</h2> <p>In the case of Cuba, the State Department policy planning council explained: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"The primary danger we face in Castro is \u2026 in the impact the very existence of his regime has upon the leftist movement in many Latin American countries \u2026 The simple fact is that Castro represents a successful defiance of the US, a negation of our whole hemispheric policy of almost a century and a half.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The Monroe Doctrine announced the US intention, then unrealizable, of dominating the western hemisphere. An example of great contemporary import is revealed in Iran scholar Ervand Abrahamian's important <a href=\"http://thenewpress.com/index.php?option=com_title&amp;task=view_title&amp;metaproductid=1868\">recent study</a> of the US-UK coup that overthrew the parliamentary regime of Iran in 1953. With scrupulous examination of internal records, he shows convincingly that standard accounts cannot be sustained. The primary causes were not cold war concerns, nor Iranian irrationality that undermined Washington's \"benign intentions\", nor even access to oil or profits, but rather the demand for \"overall controls\" with the broader implications for global dominance, threatened by independent nationalism. That is what we discover over and over by investigating particular cases.</p> <p>Cuba, too, not surprisingly \u2013 though the fanaticism might merit examination in this case. US policy towards Cuba is harshly condemned throughout Latin America, and indeed most of the world, but \"a decent respect for the opinions of mankind\" is understood to be meaningless rhetoric intoned mindlessly on 4 July. Ever since polls have been taken on the matter, a considerable majority of the US population has favored normalization of relations with Cuba, but that, too, is insignificant. Dismissal of public opinion is, of course, quite normal. What is interesting in this case is dismissal of powerful sectors of US economic power, which also favor normalization, and are usually highly influential in setting policy: energy, agribusiness, pharmaceuticals and others. That suggests that there is a powerful state interest involved in punishing Cubans, as well as the cultural factors revealed in the hysteria of the Camelot intellectuals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397785053\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350323930816/Fidal-Castro-with-Nikita--008.jpg\" alt=\"Fidal Castro with Nikita Khrushchev in Moscow, 1963\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cuba's Communist leader Fidel Castro with Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev during a 1963 official visit to Moscow.

The outcome was not obscure. That evening, in a special CBS News broadcast, <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1987-10-23/local/me-10523_1_cuban-missile-crisis\">Charles Collingwood reported</a> that the world had come out \"from under the most terrible threat of nuclear holocaust since the second world war\", with a \"humiliating defeat for Soviet policy\". Dobbs comments that the Russians tried to pretend that the outcome was \"yet another triumph for Moscow's peace-loving foreign policy over warmongering imperialists\", as \"the supremely wise, always reasonable Soviet leadership had saved the world from the threat of nuclear destruction.\" Extricating the basic facts from the fashionable ridicule, Khrushchev's agreement to capitulate \"had saved the world from the threat of nuclear destruction\".</p> <p>The crisis, however, was not over. On 8 November, the Pentagon announced that all known Soviet missile bases had been dismantled. And on the same day, Stern reports, \"a sabotage team carried out an attack on a Cuban factory,\" though Kennedy's terror campaign, Operation Mongoose, had been formally curtailed at the peak of the crisis. The 8 November terror attack lends support to Bundy's observation that the threat to peace was Cuba, not Turkey \u2013 where the Russians were not continuing a lethal assault. Not, however, what Bundy had in mind, or could have understood.</p> <p>More details are added by the highly respected scholar Raymond Garthoff, who also had a great deal of experience within the government, in his careful 1987 account of the missile crisis. <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=7zeg81n47GsC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=Raymond+Garthoff+a+Cuban+covert+action+sabotage+team+dispatched+from+the+United+States+successfully+blew+up+a+Cuban+industrial+facility&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N-eskttTFO&amp;sig=QPZucjCqfdly4Wzio7rmkZB1_SA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hBt8UJbnHcWY1AX_04GoAw&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Raymond%20Garthoff%20a%20Cuban%20covert%20action%20sabotage%20team%20dispatched%20from%20the%20United%20States%20successfully%20blew%20up%20a%20Cuban%20industrial%20facility&amp;f=false\">On 8 November, he writes</a>, \"a Cuban covert action sabotage team dispatched from the United States successfully blew up a Cuban industrial facility,\" killing 400 workers, according to a Cuban government letter to the UN Secretary General. Garthoff comments that \"the Soviets could only see [the attack] as an effort to backpedal on what was, for them, the key question remaining: American assurances not to attack Cuba,\" particularly since the terrorist attack was launched from the US. These and other \"third-party actions\" reveal again, he concludes, \"that the risk and danger to both sides could have been extreme, and catastrophe not excluded.\" Garthoff also reviews the murderous and destructive operations of Kennedy's terrorist campaign, which we would certainly regard as more than ample justification for war, if the US or its allies or clients were victims, not perpetrators.</p> <p>From the same source we learn further that on 23 August 1962, the president had issued <a href=\"http://http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175430/best_of_tomdispatch%3A_noam_chomsky_on_terrorizing_cuba\">National Security Memorandum No 181</a>, \"a directive to engineer an internal revolt that would be followed by US military intervention\", involving \"significant US military plans, maneuvers, and movement of forces and equipment\" that were surely known to Cuba and Russia. Also in August, terrorist attacks were intensified, including speedboat strafing attacks on a Cuban seaside hotel \"where Soviet military technicians were known to congregate, killing a score of Russians and Cubans\"; attacks on British and Cuban cargo ships; contaminating sugar shipments; and other atrocities and sabotage, mostly carried out by Cuban exile organizations permitted to operate freely in Florida. Shortly after came \"the most dangerous moment in human history\", not exactly out of the blue.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397785054\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350323559111/Bay-of-Pigs-captured-rebe-008.jpg\" alt=\"Bay of Pigs captured rebels 1961\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Captured Cuban rebels in the wake of the 1961 CIA-backed invasion fiasco at the Bay of Pigs, Cuba.

Ten days before his assassination, he approved a CIA plan for \"destruction operations\" by US proxy forces \"against a large oil refinery and storage facilities, a large electric plant, sugar refineries, railroad bridges, harbor facilities, and underwater demolition of docks and ships\". A plot to assassinate Castro was apparently initiated on the day of the Kennedy assassination. The terrorist campaign was called off in 1965, but \"one of Nixon's first acts in office in 1969 was to direct the CIA to intensify covert operations against Cuba,\" Garthoff reports.</p> <p>In the current issue of <a href=\"http://www.psqonline.org/article.cfm?IDArticle=19003\">Political Science Quarterly</a>, Montague Kern observes that the Cuban missile crisis is one of those \"full-bore crises \u2026 in which an ideological enemy (the Soviet Union) is universally perceived to have gone on the attack, leading to a rally-'round-the-flag effect that greatly expands support for a president, increasing his policy options.\" Kern is right that it is \"universally perceived\" that way, apart from those who have escaped sufficiently from the ideological shackles to pay some attention to the facts. Kern is, in fact, one of them. Another is Sheldon Stern, who recognizes what has long been known to such deviants. As he writes, we now know that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Khrushchev's original explanation for shipping missiles to Cuba had been fundamentally true: the Soviet leader had never intended these weapons as a threat to the security of the United States, but rather considered their deployment a defensive move to protect his Cuban allies from American attacks and as a desperate effort to give the USSR the appearance of equality in the nuclear balance of power.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Dobbs, too, recognizes that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Castro and his Soviet patrons had real reasons to fear American attempts at regime change, including, as a last resort, a US invasion of Cuba \u2026 [Khrushchev] was also sincere in his desire to defend the Cuban revolution from the mighty neighbor to the north.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The American attacks are often dismissed in US commentary as silly pranks, CIA shenanigans that got out of hand. That is far from the truth. The best and the brightest had reacted to the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion with near hysteria, including the president, who solemnly informed the country that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The complacent, the self-indulgent, the soft societies are about to be swept away with the debris of history. Only the strong \u2026 can possibly survive.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And they can only survive, he evidently believed, by massive terror \u2013 though that addendum was kept secret, and is still not known to loyalists who perceive the ideological enemy as having \"gone on the attack\" \u2013 the near-universal perception, as Kern observes. After the Bay of Pigs defeat, historian Piero Gleijeses writes that JFK launched a crushing embargo to punish the Cubans for defeating a US-run invasion, and \"asked his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, to lead the top-level interagency group that oversaw Operation Mongoose, a program of paramilitary operations, economic warfare and sabotage he launched in late 1961 to visit the 'terrors of the earth' on Fidel Castro and, more prosaically, to topple him.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/11/26/specials/schlesinger-robert.html\">phrase \"terrors of the earth\"</a> is Arthur Schlesinger's, in his quasi-official biography of Robert Kennedy, who was assigned responsibility to conduct the terrorist war, and informed the CIA that the Cuban problem carries \"the top priority in the United States Government \u2013 all else is secondary \u2013 no time, no effort, or manpower is to be spared\" in the effort to overthrow the Castro regime. The Mongoose operations were run by Edward Lansdale, who had ample experience in \"counterinsurgency\" \u2013 a standard term for terrorism that we direct. He provided a timetable leading to \"open revolt and overthrow of the Communist regime\" in October 1962.</p> <p>The \"final definition\" of the program recognized that \"final success will require decisive US military intervention,\" after terrorism and subversion had laid the basis. The implication is that US military intervention would take place in October 1962 \u2013 when the missile crisis erupted. The events just reviewed help explain why Cuba and Russia had good reason to take such threats seriously.</p> <p>Years later, Robert McNamara recognized that Cuba was justified in fearing an attack. \"If I were in Cuban or Soviet shoes, I would have thought so, too,\" he observed at a major conference on the missile crisis on the 40th anniversary. As for Russia's \"desperate effort to give the USSR the appearance of equality\", to which Stern refers, recall that Kennedy's very narrow victory in the 1960 election relied heavily on a fabricated \"missile gap\" concocted to terrify the country and to condemn the Eisenhower administration as soft on national security. There was indeed a \"missile gap\", but strongly in favor of the US. The first \"public, unequivocal administration statement\" on the true facts, <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=9us4Q9iFI7kC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=Deputy+Secretary+of+Defense+Roswell+Gilpatric+the+US+would+have+a+larger+nuclear+delivery+system+left+after+a+surprise+attack&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zabHQyP8nb&amp;sig=rtgg58Gexy7dL2MafuxpotcQhwo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eip8UNDUOorJ0QWulIGQDA&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Deputy%20Secretary%20of%20Defense%20Roswell%20Gilpatric%20the%20US%20would%20have%20a%20larger%20nuclear%20delivery%20system%20left%20after%20a%20surprise%20attack&amp;f=false\">according to strategic analyst Desmond Ball</a> in his authoritative study of the Kennedy missile program, was in October 1961, when Deputy Secretary of Defense Roswell Gilpatric informed the Business Council that \"the US would have a larger nuclear delivery system left after a surprise attack than the nuclear force which the Soviet Union could employ in its first strike.\"</p> <p>The Russians, of course, were well aware of their relative weakness and vulnerability. They were also aware of Kennedy's reaction when Khrushchev offered to sharply reduce offensive military capacity and proceeded to do so unilaterally when Kennedy failed to respond: namely, Kennedy undertook a huge armaments program.</p> <h2>In retrospect</h2> <p>The two most crucial questions about the missile crisis are how it began, and how it ended. It began with Kennedy's terrorist attack against Cuba, with a threat of invasion in October 1962. It ended with the president's rejection of Russian offers that would seem fair to a rational person, but were unthinkable because they would undermine the fundamental principle that the US has the unilateral right to deploy nuclear missiles anywhere, aimed at China or Russia or anyone else, and right on their borders; and the accompanying principle that Cuba had no right to have missiles for defense against what appeared to be an imminent US invasion. To establish these principles firmly, it was entirely proper to face a high risk of war of unimaginable destruction, and to reject simple, and admittedly fair, ways to end the threat.</p> <p>Garthoff observes that \"in the United States, there was almost universal approbation for President Kennedy's handling of the crisis.\" Dobbs writes that \"the relentlessly upbeat tone was established by the court historian, Arthur M Schlesinger Jr, who wrote that Kennedy had 'dazzled the world' through a 'combination of toughness and restraint, of will, nerve and wisdom, so brilliantly controlled, so matchlessly calibrated'.\" Rather more soberly, Stern partially agrees, noting that Kennedy repeatedly rejected the militant advice of his advisers and associates who called for military force and dismissal of peaceful options.</p> <p>The events of October 1962 are widely hailed as Kennedy's finest hour. <a href=\"http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/13626/the_next_hiroshima/\">Graham Allison joins many others in presenting</a> them as \"a guide for how to defuse conflicts, manage great-power relationships, and make sound decisions about foreign policy in general\". In a very narrow sense, that judgment seems reasonable. The ExComm tapes reveal that the president stood apart from others, sometimes almost all others, in rejecting premature violence.</p> <p>There is, however, a further question: how should JFK's relative moderation in management of the crisis be evaluated against the background of the broader considerations just reviewed? But that question does not arise in a disciplined intellectual and moral culture, which accepts without question the basic principle that the US effectively owns the world by right, and is, by definition, a force for good despite occasional errors and misunderstandings, so that it is plainly entirely proper for the US to deploy massive offensive force all over the world, while it is an outrage for others (allies and clients apart) to make even the slightest gesture in that direction, or even to think of deterring the threatened use of violence by the benign global hegemon.</p> <p>That doctrine is the primary official charge against Iran today: it might pose a deterrent to US and Israeli force. It was a consideration during the missile crisis as well. In internal discussion, the Kennedy brothers expressed their fears that Cuban missiles might deter a US invasion of Venezuela then under consideration. So \"the Bay of Pigs was really right,\" JFK concluded.</p> <p>The principles still contribute to the constant risk of nuclear war. There has been no shortage of severe dangers since the missile crisis. Ten years later, during the 1973 Israel-Arab war, Henry Kissinger called a high-level nuclear alert (Defcon 3) to warn the Russians to keep hands off <a href=\"http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB98/press.htm\">while he was secretly authorizing Israel to violate the ceasefire</a> imposed by the US and Russia. When Reagan came into office a few years later, the US launched operations probing Russian defenses and simulating air and naval attacks, while placing Pershing missiles in Germany with a five-minute flight time to Russian targets, providing what the CIA called a \"super-sudden first strike\" capability.</p> <p>Naturally, this caused great alarm in Russia, which, unlike the US, has repeatedly been invaded and virtually destroyed. That led to a major war scare in 1983. There have been hundreds of cases when human intervention aborted a first strike minutes before launch, after automated systems gave false alarms. We don't have Russian records, but there's no doubt that their systems are far more accident-prone.</p> <p>Meanwhile, India and Pakistan have come close to nuclear war several times, and the sources of the conflict remain. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons#India.2C_Israel.2C_and_Pakistan\">Both have refused</a> to sign the non-proliferation treaty, along with Israel, and have received US support for development of their nuclear weapons programs \u2013 until today, in the case of India, now a US ally. War threats in the Middle East, which might become reality very soon, once again escalate the dangers.</p> <p>In 1962, war was avoided by Khrushchev's willingness to accept Kennedy's hegemonic demands. But we can hardly count on such sanity forever. It's a near miracle that nuclear war has so far been avoided. There is more reason than ever to attend to the <a href=\"http://www.pugwash.org/about/manifesto.htm\">warning of Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein</a>, almost 60 years ago, that we must face a choice that is \"stark and dreadful and inescapable\":</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Shall we put an end to the human race; or shall mankind renounce war?</p> </blockquote>",

Six members of the ship's crew, including Schettino, are under investigation, as are three members of Costa Crociere's crisis unit.</p> <p>The 114,500-tonne luxury cruise ship capsized after approaching the island of Giglio to perform a manoeuvre close to the shore known as a salute. After striking a rock, the ship listed first one way and then another before capsizing on a rocky ledge.</p> <p>Schettino's lawyer began by demanding that the ship's Indonesian helmsman be included in the inquiry, claiming that he delayed carrying out navigation orders by crucial seconds as Schettino was attempting the manoeuvre.</p> <p>\"It is absurd to think Schettino is the only one responsible \u2013 the report shows the helmsman mistook the order,\" said lawyer Francesco Pepe.</p> <p>\"It was not a sensible thing to do, but Schettino gave an order that was not followed. He has told me he would have had a near-miss otherwise,\" said Fredrik van Wijnen, the Dutch general secretary of the Confederation of European Shipmasters' Associations. \"He is very capable. The problem is his personality \u2013 he looks like a playboy,\" he added.</p> <p>Schettino has admitted that he made mistakes but has accused the company of mishandling the response. He said last week he was suing Costa Cruises for unfair dismissal following the accident.</p> <p>The judge threw out a request for an inquiry into the helmsman, while lawyers representing passengers pointed out that the report contradicts Schettino's claim that he helmed the ship into shallow water after the crash, aiding the evacuation.</p> <p>\"He lost control of the steering and the propeller 90 seconds after the impact. The grounding was due to wind and current,\" said Bruno Pisa, an electronics expert acting for two survivors.</p> <p>Lawyers said phone calls between Schettino and crisis unit member Roberto Ferrarini minutes after the impact suggested the firm knew the ship was sinking and was partly responsible for the delay in giving the order to abandon ship until an hour after the collision.</p> <p>Schettino's voice can be heard on the black box recording on the bridge, but not Ferrarini's.</p> <p>\"When the case starts in the US I will be asking Ferrarini under deposition what he said,\" said Eaves.</p> <p>\"The blame starts with the firm hiring Schettino as well as building ships which are too tall and tip over,\" said another American lawyer, Peter Ronai, who is representing 10 Hungarian passengers. \"We understand there are problems with machinery \u2013 my car's GPS is better than their radar.\"</p> <p>Eaves said the \u20ac11,000 (\u00a38,850) compensation offered by Costa Crociere was \"disrespectful peanuts\", compared to the settlements from $200,000 (\u00a3125,000) to $5m he said he would aim for.</p> <p>The Costa Concordia is still half-submerged. Two bodies have still not been recovered.</p> <p>The hearing continues.</p>",
  "<p>As I noted on Sunday, the New York Times Public Editor Margaret Sullivan devoted her weekly Sunday column to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/public-editor/questions-on-drones-unanswered-still.html?src=twr&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">an excellent critique</a> of her paper's coverage of US drone attacks. While noting that the Times has done some good work in attempting to bring transparency to the Obama administration's secret killings - in particular its <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">May \"kill list\" article</a> revealing that Obama adopted a <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/05/29/militants_media_propaganda/\">ludicrously broad</a> definition of \"militant\" that skews the \"data\" on civilian deaths - she then wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Since the article in May, its reporting has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/07/world/asia/15-killed-in-us-drone-strike-in-pakistan-aimed-at-taliban.html\">not aggressively challenged</a> the administration's description of those killed as 'militants' - itself an undefined term. And it has been criticized for giving administration officials <a href=\"http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ask_this.view&amp;askthisid=562\">the cover of anonymity</a> when they suggest that critics of drones are terrorist sympathizers.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>There are, to put it mildly, numerous reasons for serious skepticism when it comes to administration claims about its drone program and civilian deaths. For one, Obama's chief counterterrorism adviser, John Brennan, was <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/07/19/drones/\">conclusively proven</a> to be spouting outright lies about civilian deaths from US drones. </p> <p>That the Obama administration re-defined \"militant\" to mean \"all military-age males in a strike zone as combatants\" by itself demands extreme skepticism of its claims; as the Times put it when revealing that fact: \"this counting method may partly explain the official claims of extraordinarily low collateral deaths.\" Independently, the fact that the administration has <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/07/aclu-sues-awlaki-khan-death\">erected such extreme secrecy</a> around the program - refusing to release even the most basic facts in court or elsewhere - further demands great skepticism of its assertions.</p> <p>Beyond all that, a study jointly issued by NYU School of Law and Stanford Law School last month <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/25/study-obama-drone-deaths\">documented</a> highly misleading public statements from administration officials about its drone attacks. And, as <a href=\"http://antiwar.com/blog/2012/10/15/undercounting-civilian-deaths-in-drone-strikes/\">John Glaser reports</a>, this morning, yet <a href=\"http://web.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/microsites/human-rights-institute/COLUMBIACountingDronesFinalNotEmbargo.pdf\">another new report</a> has just been issued, this one from Columbia Law School, documenting that civilian deaths are \"significantly and consistently underestimated\" by pro-drone think thanks such as the New America Foundation (the NYU/Stanford study also harshly impugned the \"data\" of NAF and its chief administration spokesman, Peter Bergen).</p> <p>All of this makes Sullivan's call for journalistic challenge to administration drone claims not just unremarkable but self-evident. But her desire for adversarial skepticism very much upset perpetual government defender Benjamin Wittes of the Brookings Institution. <a href=\"http://www.lawfareblog.com/2012/10/very-strange-column-by-the-new-york-times-public-editor/\">At his aptly named blog</a> \"Lawfare\" - the term of derision used by war cheerleaders to mock the notion that \"law\" has any role to play in restraining their endless wars and the leaders who fight them - Wittes, in his headline, proclaimed Sullivan's article to be \"Very Strange\". After quoting her criticism that the paper has insufficiently challenged administration claims on drone deaths, he wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"I find this a bewildering argument. The Times is not an advocacy organization whose job it is to 'aggressively challenge' the government's claims of the rates of civilian casualties - except to the extent that those claims are untrue.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It's amazing that someone not only believes - but is willing to say publicly - that it is not the job of a newspaper to \"aggressively challenge\" government claims on a highly controversial assassination program that is shrouded in secrecy and uncertainty. That, more than anything else, is the core purpose of journalism (at least in theory): the reason \"freedom of the press\" is protected in the First Amendment. And it's precisely the media's systematic failure - more accurately: its unwillingness - to engage in this function that has produced the last decade's most destructive outcomes.</p> <p>Wittes' caveat that newspapers should \"aggressively challenge\" government claims only when \"those claims are untrue\" is circular and nonsensical. The only way to find out whether government claims are untrue is by aggressively challenging them. A failure to do so ensures that even the most dubious and unproven of government assertions go unchecked. Indeed, Wittes himself has previously argued that secrecy surrounding the drone program is excessive. </p> <p>More to the point, the presumption Wittes advocates is exactly backward: government claims are not entitled to a presumption of truth by media outlets unless and until they are proven false. The opposite is true: they ought to be treated with extreme skepticism by media outlets unless and until they are proven true. That is what \"adversarial journalism\" means.</p> <p>The very idea that government assertions are entitled to a presumption of truth even when they are shrouded in secrecy, subject to no accountability, and unaccompanied by proof, is the mindset of a servile government propagandist. It's astonishing that, even after what happened in the run-up to the Iraq War - when media outlets placed themselves in the supine posture exemplified by Wittes - that anyone is willing to stand up in public and advocate this model of government-subservient \"journalism\".</p> <p>Then again, there should be nothing surprising about any of this given that both Brookings and Wittes are classic examples of that sprawling strain of Washington think tank culture that exist for little reason other than to serve and justify government power. They are pure expressions of the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/08/15/the_sham_terrorism_expert_industry/\">courtier Beltway mentality</a> that demands that everyone else be as reverent of royal court prerogatives as they are.</p> <p>Brookings, of course, was one of the <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2007/07/30/15134/ohanlon-pollack/\">leaders in persuading Americans</a>, especially many American liberals, to support the attack on and eight-year occupation of Iraq, and it remains <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/10/11/iran-s-covert-war-against-the-united-states-shows-tehran-has-no-fear-of-us-military-retaliation.html\">vocally in the lead</a> in the fear-mongering campaign against Iran. Its national security \"experts\" have been lavishly funded by billionaire mogul Haim Saban, who has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/05/business/yourmoney/05sab.html?ei=5088&amp;en=9eb8c2a72c2b5e7d&amp;ex=1252123200&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;position\">described himself</a> as a \"total hawk\" and said: I'm a one-issue guy and my issue is Israel.\"</p> <p>Wittes is not only a <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/12/05/politifact_and_the_scam_of_neutral_expertise/\">reflexive defender</a> of the use of US military force, including drones, but recently supplied one of the creeper and more revealing episodes when he gathered with a former Bush Homeland Security official and their children to simulate \"drone warfare\" for fun, all while NPR<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2012/09/25/161752666/national-security-experts-go-rogue-for-drone-smackdown\"> giggled, watched and reported</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"It started as trash talk between two contributors to a national security blog. They decided to host a drone smackdown to see if one guy's machine could take down another. . . . </p> <p>\"The first contestant was a drone with interlocking black loops to protect the rotors, shaped like the burners on your stove top. The machine, nicknamed Stux2bu, belonged to [Ben] Wittes, co-founder of Lawfare, the blog that sponsored the contest. . . . .</p> <p>\"They pointed out the name of their drone derived from the word Stuxnet, the infamous real-world computer virus discovered in June 2010 that targeted Iran's nuclear enrichment efforts.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This is what people do who spend their lives cheering for American military force and violence and killing but refuse to get anywhere near the fighting they adore: they play-act as tough-guy warriors, having some nice Sunday fun playing with weapons that routinely kill innocent people, including children, as they provide the intellectual justification and apologia from a safe distance. (After describing all of the fun drone festivities, NPR justified itself by adding on as a cursory afterthought: \"To a lot of people, drones are no laughing matter. U.S. machines equipped with deadly missiles have killed al-Qaida leaders in Pakistan and Yemen. They've also killed some innocent civilians\").</p> <p>Although it may seem repellent, the view that media outlets should dutifully amplify rather than \"aggressively challenge\" government claims is quite pervasive, especially among establishment journalists themselves. Indeed, that is more or less what it means to be an \"establishment journalist\", and it is this mindset, more than any other, that explains how the attack on Iraq was able to be launched based on a mountain of falsehoods.</p> <p>In 2004, Guardian columnist George Monbiot <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/2004/07/20/the-lies-of-the-press/\">wrote</a>: \"the falsehoods reproduced by the media before the invasion of Iraq were massive and consequential: it is hard to see how Britain could have gone to war if the press had done its job.\" In a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/dec/15/media.pressandpublishing\">2004 Guardian Op-Ed</a> on the role played by the western media in enabling that attack, David Edwards and David Cromwell traced the last century's structural history of journalism in order to argue that mindlessly conveying government claims is no longer an <em>abandonment</em> of the purpose of modern journalism but rather a core <em>fulfillment</em> of it.</p> <p>Edwards and Cromwell quoted ITV News political editor, Nick Robinson - responding to criticisms of his pre-war reporting - this way: \"<em>It was my job to report what those in power were doing or thinking</em> . . . That is all someone in my sort of job can do.\" <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2008/12/29/gregory_2/\">Countless American journalists</a>, including the most influential ones, have expressed similar sentiments.</p> <p>Those who believe that media institutions should serve as an adversarial check on government power will find Sullivan's column utterly uncontroversial and obvious. About Wittes attack on Sullivan, the ACLU's Jameel Jaffer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JameelJaffer/status/257866518476496896\">said this morning to Lawfare</a>: \"Now you are parodying yourselves.\"</p> <p>But for those who devote themselves to serving, venerating and justifying the acts of those in power - like the Brooking Institutions' Wittes - Sullivan's view is \"very strange\" indeed, even offensive. To them, the very idea that government claims should be \"aggressively challenged\" is virtually blasphemous, a total contradiction of the goals to which they are devoted. As Kade Crockford <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kade_ellis/status/257863525874163713\">put it</a> today: \"'aggressively challenging' the government on its claims has a way of helping the facts come out.\" That's precisely why Wittes and friends find it so distasteful.</p> <p>The drone program is popular in part because US media outlets parrot US governments assertions and thus reflexively claim that the victims are \"militants\" - even though they have no idea who was actually killed, even though the term itself is wildly propagandistic, even though the Obama administration refuses to disclose basic evidence, and even though there is ample evidence proving how unreliable those claims are. Only by having media outlets refrain from \"aggressively challenging\" government claims can those claims, and thus support for drone attacks, be sustained. That's why Sullivan's call - made in the pages of the New York Times itself - is so threatening to some.</p> <p>There really is no point in having media outlets that do anything other than \"aggressively challenge\" the claims of those in power. Actually, there is a point in having that: it allows government assertions to be glorified as true even when there is no evidence that they are. That is why so many power-serving Washington mavens are so eager to defend that model and demand adherence to it. And their success in that mission is why so many destructive government falsehoods are able to flourish without real scrutiny.</p>",

He told reporters she had not yet been assessed by British medics but said she would not have been brought to the UK at all if her chances recovery were not good.</p> <p>Six days after a gunman clambered into the back of a van full of her classmates and shot her from point blank range, the 14-year-old landed at Birmingham airport after flying by on a special air ambulance from Pakistan. Malala travelled to the UK on her own, but her family may follow later.</p> <p>The Queen Elizabeth hospital is also home to the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine, the primary receiving unit for military casualties returned from overseas.</p> <p>\"Malala's bravery in standing up for the right of all young girls in Pakistan to an education is an example to us all,\" said the foreign secretary, William Hague.</p> <p>A spokesman for Pakistan's military said the girl would require \"prolonged care to fully recover from the physical and psychological effects of the trauma that she has received\". That is likely to include the partial rebuilding of her skull and \"intensive neuro-rehabilitation\".</p> <p>While in the UK she will also be safe from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the militant group that has claimed responsibility for shooting her and which has vowed to try and kill her again if she recovers. The attempted murder of the young peace activist sparked worldwide condemnation and sent shockwaves through Pakistani society.</p> <p>Politicians have been forced to make strong public stands against the TTP, tens of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets and journalists daring to reflect the public mood have been warned of planned reprisals by militants.</p> <p>Efforts to save the life of a young girl who rose to prominence in 2009 after writing a BBC blog describing the terror of living under Taliban insurgency in Pakistan's Swat valley have already seen her shuttled between hospitals. She was initially airlifted from Swat to Peshawar, where surgeons spent three hours removing a bullet that had become lodged near her spinal cord.</p> <p>Her injury was not instantly fatal because she ducked just before the gunman fired, apparently ensuring the bullet missed much of her brain. She was later moved to a hospital in Rawalpindi, the garrison town close to the Pakistani capital.</p> <p>Although she has been unconscious throughout her ordeal, relying on a ventilator to breathe, she has received bedside visits from some of the most powerful people in the land, including the prime minister and the army chief. The military has described her recovery as satisfactory and said she was able to move her legs and hands several days ago when her sedatives were reduced. It has not said whether she suffered any brain damage or other permanent trauma.</p> <p>Offers of assistance have poured in from across the world, including from paediatric surgeons at Johns Hopkins University's school of medicine in Baltimore, in the US. However, it was decided on Sunday that she should be moved to the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham.</p> <p>Moazzam Khan, spokesman for the Pakistani ministry of foreign affairs, said the decision not to accept the US offer of help had been taken by her doctors for purely medical reasons. \"Several other countries had also offered treatment, and the US was among them,\" he said. \"But due to the conditions of the patient and keeping in view the distance and the hours of travelling Britain was preferred.\"</p> <p>The Queen Elizabeth is one of Britain's 16 major trauma centres specialising in treating severe gunshot wounds and major head injuries. The Foreign Office said the Islamabad government is bearing the costs of transportation and treatment.</p> <p>Gordon Brown, the UN special envoy for global education, launched an I am Malala petition on Monday. \"Today, sadly, 32 million girls are not going to school, and it is time to fight harder for Malala's dream to come true,\" he said. He added he would hand the petition to Asif Ali Zardari when he visited the Pakistani president next month and that it would also be given to the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon.</p> <p>Police have arrested at least three suspects in connection with the attack but the two gunmen who carried out the shooting remain at large.</p> <p>The biggest rally yet showing solidarity with Malala was held in Karachi on Sunday with an estimated 10,000 people. Although some politicians have been criticised for not specifically naming the TTP in their otherwise damning statements about the incident, many analysts have been impressed by the resolve of Pakistan's leaders.</p> <p>Last week, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the powerful army chief, released a statement in which he called Yousafzai an \"icon of courage and hope\" and vowed to fight against terror \"regardless of the cost\". There has even been speculation that the current mood of national outrage may lead to military operations to try and clear militants out of North Waziristan, an area near the border of Afghanistan where the US has long demanded action.</p> <p>On Monday however, Rehman Malik, the country's interior minister, said there were no such plans currently.</p>",

  "<p>It is late afternoon in a red-brick house in north Norfolk, and the four Kirk children are squished on to the sofa, still in their school uniforms, discussing the art of fake fighting. \"I&#xa0;fake-punched: I&#xa0;stopped about that far away,\" explains Shaun, his eyes broad and blue, hands held apart to show the proximity of his punch. \"We had to pretend to hit 'em, coz we weren't actually allowed to <em>actual</em> hit 'em, because if we did we'd get into more trouble.\"</p> <p>Stephanie, Robert, Shaun and Katrina Kirk are the four stars of Michael Winterbottom's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149646/everyday\" title=\"\">Everyday</a>, in competition at the London film festival this week. Shot intermittently over five years, it features <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/john-simm\" title=\"\">John Simm</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/apr/03/shirley-henderson-interview\" title=\"\">Shirley Henderson</a> as a couple coping with his imprisonment for theft. As Simm sees out his jail term, we watch Henderson struggling to care for their children: the challenge of making ends meet, the difficulty of providing enough discipline and love, the loneliness of waiting.</p> <p>Key to the film's success is its steady rhythm of repetitions: the family home all dolled up each Christmas, the classrooms, the workplaces, the procession of buses and trains in the long journey to visit Simm, the visiting rooms with their plastic chairs and Formica tables. These airless scenes are interspersed with glorious shots of the Norfolk countryside wheeling through the seasons: rippling wheat fields and broad stretches of sand, poppies, hedgerows. Behind them swells a score by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/dec/25/paul-morley-christmas\" title=\"\">Michael Nyman</a>, a frequent Winterbottom collaborator.</p> <p>The Kirks were first approached in 2007. \"Michael had toured around looking for one small boy around Shaun's age,\" explains Sarah, the children's mother. \"They wanted someone who looked like they could be John's son, and they'd done eight or nine primary schools. We had a letter home from school to say they were doing a short film. Then the school rang up and said they wanted to film Shaun playing in his home environment. They didn't realise until then that I had three other children.\"</p> <p>Six weeks later, the film-makers were in touch to say they wanted to cast all four children. (\"It was Shaun we cast first,\" Winterbottom tells me later. \"He has this amazing face: there's something natural, but also something so expressive. But of course all the children were great.\") Their parents were hesitant. \"We just thought they were weirdos,\" their father, Colin, says bluntly. \"When we first heard about the film I said, 'Does that sound a bit weird or what?' We had to check up on the internet, make sure they were&#xa0;genuine.\"</p> <p>Their fears were allayed when Winterbottom visited to explain what the project would entail, and what he hoped it would produce. \"And they seemed genuine,\" says Colin. \"Just nice people. So I said to the kids, 'Do you want to make a film?' They said 'Dunno.' So I explained what it was about and they said, 'Yeah, all right.'\"</p> <p>Filming began a few months later, with the family home doubling as a location. Winterbottom issued the parents with strict instructions not to redecorate for five years, though they rebelled after two (\"because it was falling to bits,\" says Robert). Sometimes a shoot would last a week, sometimes three or four days \u2013 but they started at 6am and ran late into the evening. Sarah says the children had breaks and plenty of sweets to see them through, but often the camera shows them looking exhausted and tearful.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397783429\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350318651450/Everyday---Shirley-Hender-010.jpg\" alt=\"Everyday - Shirley Henderson and the Kirk children\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'I was amazed to see myself four years old' ... the Kirk children with Shirley Henderson in Everyday</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At times, the children say, they grew frustrated by all the repetition. \"Doing it over and over and over,\" sighs Robert, now 12. \"Once you've done it six times you'd think, that's enough, but they'd do it more.\" Stephanie, 14, nods. \"And it's quite hard,\" she says, \"because you don't have a script, or a set line to say each time.\" Robert recalls how on one occasion he insisted Winterbottom simply stop. \"I told him, 'I've had enough, I want to go to bed,'\" he says. \"'He said, 'One more,' and then he did another three takes.\" The children laugh. \"But Michael knew what he was doing,\" says Stephanie, \"so we shouldn't really&#xa0;interfere. I was a little bit scared of him when I was younger, but now he's just like a mate.\"</p> <p>Some of the most moving scenes cover the sporadic visits to Simm in prison: the early starts, Henderson battling through wind and rain, the children trailing behind her. We see the young Shaun hurling himself at Simm's legs with a sobbed \"Dad!\" Later, an exhausted Katrina sits amid this dark, adult world and bursts into tears.</p> <p>\"Well, I didn't really know what a prison looked like when I was little, so when I first went in I thought: 'scary',\" Katrina says. \"It definitely smelled strange. It smelled damp.\" Then there were the actual prisoners, too \u2013 some of whom worked as extras. She was tired that day, and still only four years old. \"All these people were banging on their cell walls,\" adds Stephanie. \"We were all pretty scared.\"</p> <p>But the prize for on-screen crying has to go to Shaun. His huge blue eyes well up throughout the film, from those prison visits to being made to eat shepherd's pie. \"At first I did actually cry,\" he says, \"but then Michael wanted me to keep on doing it, so then I kept on making myself cry. Michael said to think of something that will upset you. So I just thought of something really, really sad. I just thought and thought, and then the last thing that popped into my head made me start crying. I'm not sure what it was \u2013 I've forgotten.\"</p> <p>\"The great worry of film-making is the impact it will have on the children,\" Winterbottom says. \"But because this was made over a long period of time, I think it's been a good thing for them, too.\" It was only once filming finished that he realised what a large part they had played in the children's lives: \"We visited them perhaps once every six months,\" he says. \"And it's strange, it's like having your own children \u2013 you don't notice them growing up, it's very incremental; time passing in the real world is very different to time passing in the fictional world, where you would cast a different actor for each stage of a boy growing up. But then you watch it back and you realise Shaun was still in nappies when we started&#xa0;filming.\"</p> <p>The children were given few lines and little direction, and as a result have an easy on-screen presence. \"They said, 'Just be yourselves, act natural,'\" Shaun remembers. \"I liked doing it, I found it quite fun.\" For Robert, there was the delight of being encouraged to misbehave: his character dabbles in petty theft, fights, stays out late. \"Michael didn't really explain it,\" Robert says. \"He just said, 'Be naughty.' The naughtiest thing I did was go out to the forest, and I came back really late. I was out till about nine.\" When he does return, he is shown carrying a squirrel he has shot with his father's rifle. \"Some other people shot it,\" he explains. \"I just had to carry it. It felt like a cat, a bit heavy.\"</p> <p>The on-screen bond between Simm, Henderson and the children is tangible; their real-life father says it was strange to see his children refer so easily to another man as 'Dad'. Simm and Henderson visited before filming began. They were nervous to have such famous actors in the house, the children say. \"I had seen Shirley in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/harrypotter\" title=\"\">Harry Potter</a> and John in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006q2x0\" title=\"\">Doctor Who</a>,\" Robert says. Simm took the boys out to <a href=\"http://www.wells-guide.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Wells-next-the-Sea</a>. \"We went down to the Pop Inn cafe,\" Sarah says, \"where they have little 2p machines, and we bought ice creams.\"</p> <p>Katrina laughed the first time she watched the film, set off by Shaun impersonating Homer Simpson on the big screen. Shaun himself was mesmerised: \"I didn't really know what I looked like when I was young, and growing up and up and up and up,\" he says. \"I was just really amazed to see myself four or five years old.\"</p> <p>Their mother was in floods. \"I cried the whole way through,\" she laughs. \"Colin did as well. And he never cries. But he took a glance at me and saw me with the tissues and it set him off.\" She looks across at Colin standing in the doorway and smiles tenderly. The couple grew up locally, met at a 4 July party at the Crown in <a href=\"http://www.burnhammarket.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Burnham Market</a>, and have been together for 15 years. \"She chatted me up!\" Colin says proudly. \"She said, 'If you want a real woman, come and see me.' Sarah blushes.</p> <p>The experience of filming has changed the children, their parents say. \"I think they're better at lying,\" Colin smiles. \"And you're a bit more confident now, aren't you?\" Sarah says to Katrina. They will not discuss money, \"but they've been made comfortable,\" Colin says. \"Put it that way.\"</p> <p>Winterbottom filmed at the children's schools: shots of lunchtime football, carol concerts, the morning drop-off, the afternoon collection. The children were also allowed time off to attend film festivals. But some of their classmates have been less understanding. \"They didn't believe me [that I was in a film],\" Robert says, with a prickle of frustration. \"I was telling them and they were all like, 'No you're not, no you're not.'\" The children hope that when the film screens this autumn on Channel 4 \u2013 <a href=\"http://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/tiff/2012/everyday\" title=\"\">which part-funded the project as a way of exploring the impact on families of jail time</a> \u2013 they might be vindicated.</p> <p>Already there have been screenings at the <a href=\"http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/telluride-review-michael-winterbottoms-everyday-is-uneven-long-but-emotionally-rewarding-20120903\" title=\"\">Telluride</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149646/everyday\" title=\"\">Toronto</a> film festivals, for which the family got passports and flew for the first time. \"Telluride was lovely,\" says Sarah. \"We had three big bedrooms, and a big spa bath, which you decided to try out, didn't you?\" She nudges Shaun. \"But he mucked it up,\" Katrina giggles. \"He turned it on with all the jets going the wrong way,\" Colin explains.</p> <p>This week they will be in London, and tomorrow will walk the red carpet and try not to get overawed by the crowds and flashing cameras. The children have been practising their autographs. Will their film win the festival's top prize? Robert gives a faint frown. \"Probably,\" he says. \"Probably.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Everyday screens on Channel 4 in November, and at <a href=\"http://www.film4.com/minisite/the-london-film-festival-2012\" title=\"\">the London film festival</a> this week</p>",
  "<p>Virgin will continue to run trains on the west coast mainline for the next year, the transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin has confirmed, but opponents and lawyers warned that his decision could be storing up more legal and political problems for the future.</p> <p>McLoughlin told the Commons he would be \"commencing negotiations with Virgin\" to run the route \"subject to ensuring value for money for taxpayer\". He said passengers would not be affected by the franchising fiasco that saw the lucrative London to Glasgow service awarded to FirstGroup before a judicial review sought by Virgin stopped the contracts being signed.</p> <p>McLoughlin praised FirstGroup and Virgin and restated the \"government's commitment to ensuring we have private sector innovation in the railways\", promising to restart the franchising programme as soon as possible.</p> <p>The arrangement extends Virgin's current contract for between nine and 13 months and resolves the immediate question of who runs the trains after 9 December. The alternative \u2013 asking the government-owned Directly Operated Railways (DOR) to run the route \u2013 would have seen both the major north-south rail arteries in state hands.</p> <p>While Virgin continues to run trains on the route, a franchise competition will be heldto cover a subsequent interim period in which the long-term future of the line is decided.</p> <p>Senior industry sources said it seemed to be a \"foregone conclusion\" that the incumbent would stay in place until a long-term handover. However, Sir Richard Branson's firm will be aware of the recent award of a two-year Greater Anglia franchise to the Dutch operator Abellio, whose winning bid was seen as a loss-leader to get a foothold in UK rail with a view to future contracts.</p> <p>The shadow transport secretary, Maria Eagle, said the solution was a \"complete mess\" and accused McLoughlin of trying to deflect blame for the \"embarrassing debacle\" on to officials when cost-cutting ministers were to blame for losing key staff and cancelling an audit. She said the fiasco was \"pouring tens of millions of taxpayers' money down the drain\".</p> <p>Lord Adonis, a former transport secretary, tweeted that the \"omnishambles\" would mean \"huge further cost and instability\".</p> <p>Unions denounced the arrangement as an \"ideological stitch up\", while lawyers warned that the solution posed as many problems as it solved.</p> <p>Patrick Twist, of the legal firm Pinsent Masons, said: \"It is not obvious that the short term nine-13 month contract, which is now being proposed to be entered with Virgin, should not be open to competition under procurement law.\"</p> <p>He added that the interim franchise contract would also be controversial. \"FirstGroup, and others, may argue that it is of such a short duration that Virgin Rail, as the incumbent operator, has a disproportionate advantage in bidding for it. Though the interim contract is ostensibly being competed, they may say that there it is not the level playing field required by procurement law.\"</p> <p>Analysts suggested there may be implications from the decision for the other paused franchise competitions \u2013 possibly seeing the services passed, at least temporarily, into state hands.</p> <p>Gerald Khoo, of Espirito Santo, said: \"We believe this decision has been driven by concerns at the DfT [Department for Transport] that it may not be legal to extend a rail franchise agreement more than once. Great Western and Essex Thameside have both already been extended. Therefore, we would view these franchises as being at risk of either being transferred to DOR or being the subject of competitive tenders for any short-term extension.\"</p> <p>The long-term franchise the DfT was set to award to FirstGroup was officially scrapped on 3 October after the department uncovered \"significant technical flaws\" while preparing to defend a lawsuit brought by Virgin. The government blamed civil servants for incorrectly assessing the level of risk in First's winning bid.</p> <p>McLoughlin also paused the competitions for other franchises, including Essex Thameside, Great Western and Thameslink, and set up two reviews, which he said on Monday were \"well under way\". The first, led by Sam Laidlaw, will examine the mistakes in the west coast competition. A second, by Richard Brown, will look at the implications for rail franchising as a whole.</p> <p>A Virgin spokesman said: \"Customers have made it clear that they want Virgin to continue. We are delighted to have the chance to continue delivering our excellent service.\"</p> <p>In a statement, FirstGroup merely affirmed its commitment to keeping the railways in the private sector.</p> <p>\"We believe the private sector provides the most effective and efficient way to deliver passenger rail services in the UK. We await the outcome of the independent investigations into the ICWC [InterCity West Coast] franchise competition and the wider rail franchising process, which we hope will provide a greater degree of certainty and confidence not only to future bidders, but to employees, stakeholders and the travelling public too.\"</p> <p>The RMT general secretary, Bob Crow, said: \"This announcement is no surprise. The government are ideologically opposed to public ownership of the railways and \u2026 have stitched up a shabby deal that will enable them to rerun the whole franchise fiasco in a year's time.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Richard Branson and his shareholders are laughing all the way to the bank. Not only have they made hundreds of millions from the rail privatisation lottery but they have now scooped the rollover as well.\"</p>",
  "<p>When I was four and five and six years old we watched the moon landings on TV then waited nervously for the <a href=\"http://moonpans.com/apollo_11/apollo_11_splashdown.jpg\" title=\"\">splashdown</a> and the astronauts' release from their seared capsule with its orange flotation bags bobbing on a white and blue sea. In the same way millions of people watched <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/felix-baumgartner\" title=\"\">Felix Baumgartner</a>'s astonishing fall through the empty sky on YouTube. In his protective suit the Austrian daredevil looked for all the world like some Apollo astronaut of the 1960s. But did this daring deed truly recreate the images of the space age, or only an empty pastiche of them?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397782622\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350321932311/Buzz-Aldrin-walking-on-th-008.jpg\" alt=\"Buzz Aldrin walking on the moon\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Buzz Aldrin walking on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission. Photograph: AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>History always repeats itself, said Hegel. He forgot to add, said Marx \u2013 the first time as tragedy, the second as farce. Not that Baumgartner's dive was farce. It was heroic, if not foolhardy. In terms of sheer mad bravery it was stupendous. But surely those seductive, glorious, beautiful images with their evocation of the great moments of space exploration are so appealing because they fill a void in our collective heart, a void of aspiration and the belief in progress that a daredevil's leap, however gallant, cannot ever really match.</p> <p>In the end, Baumgartner's achievement is just a great stunt, with a commercial sponsor. It is in essence the same as tumbling <a href=\"http://www.niagarafallslive.com/daredevils_of_niagara_falls.htm\" title=\"\">over Niagara Falls in a barrel</a>. People have always done brave things, and in the early 20th century going over Niagara Falls in a barrel became the leap of choice for publicity-conscious stunt people (first over the top was a woman, in 1901). Yet amazing as such jumps were, did they add to human knowledge and capacity? No \u2013 the first powered flight by the Wright brothers, which was much less spectacular, just off the ground in fact, changed the world in a way stunts do not. The images of this leap look like exploration but actually are mere entertainment.</p> <p>The visual similarity between Baumgartner's record-breaking fall and the feats of engineering audacity that took human beings on to the surface of the moon and then, even in the cash-strapped 1970s, built a landable and reusable spacecraft is cruelly deceptive. Baumgartner's freefall is not the same as the public-funded, state-sponsored efforts of an entire scientific generation that not so long ago sent Neil Armstrong on to the silver dust of the lunar surface. Look closer and the visual image of this 21st century hero is not so 20th century, after all. His helmet has the words Red Bull on it, not a stars and stripes. Indeed, Red Bull logos and inscriptions are all over his space suit.</p> <p>The confusion between a publicity stunt and the great space missions of the last century is fully intended by the sponsor, to judge from images of what it calls \"Mission Control\" at Roswell, New Mexico. Mission Control is written in big letters on the wall with all those echoes of white-shorted bespectacled geeks getting Apollo 13 safely home. But again the none too subtle visual give-away: this is <a href=\"http://i2.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article1378894.ece/ALTERNATES/s510/Red+Bull+Stratos:+Mission+Control\" title=\"\">Red Bull Stratos Mission Control</a>, says the sign. Not Nasa after all.</p> <p>Seeing the earth from Baumgartner's helmet is spectacular and sad: wondrous to see this orb as the astronauts saw it, amazing that he is so high he can see the planet as a planet, but sad because he is plummeting back. All he has done is stretch gravity's elastic a bit further. What happened to breaking it entirely?</p> <p>The epic state spending that sent serious missions to the moon is a thing of the past. As Baumgartner prepared for his stunt, the space shuttle, relic of an age when in Apollo's wake space exploration seemed destined to become ever better, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/15/uk-usa-space-idUSLNE89E00C20121015\" title=\"\">was being ferried to its final resting place in a Los Angeles museum</a>. Today, private money pays for record-breaking achievements that come nowhere near the optimism of Nasa's golden age. Is exploration still a marvel <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17503395\" title=\"\">when James Cameron can buy his way into the record books</a>?</p> <p>The digital age is not an age for astronauts. Google the words \"Moon landings\" and one of the most popular search phrases offered is \"moon landings faked\".</p> <p>So in place of true exploration we idolise this pseudo-astronaut: the man who fell to earth, with style.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Joy Whitby, creator and producer</strong></h2> <p>BBC2 was supposed to launch on the night of 20 April 1964 but there was a&#xa0;huge power cut, which meant Play School went out the following morning as its very first programme. It made headlines and a year later won an SFTA, now known as a Bafta.</p> <p>There was a dearth of nursery education at the time, and all the TV programmes, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2004/jan/21/features11.g21\" title=\"\">Andy Pandy</a>, were \"canned\" series that had been filmed long ago. There was no fresh thinking. Play School, a half-hour programme airing every week day, was meant to change all that. I'd written a report on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE9dsOu3oE8\" title=\"\">Watch with Mother</a> and was given the job of producer, with a free rein.</p> <p>I wrote the first six weeks of shows and came up with all the key elements: the story chair, the clock, the windows. I was keen to address one child, not several; a lot of programmes would say, \"Are you all listening?\" when actually a&#xa0;small child thinks of a show as coming directly to him or her.</p> <p>Having a large team of presenters \u2013 at least 10 \u2013 was an innovation. You'd have different pairs each week and the chemistry kept it very alive. When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/feb/20/how-we-made-trumpton\" title=\"\">Brian Cant</a> came to audition, I&#xa0;asked him to sit in a cardboard box and imagine going on a journey. He sailed away with a broomstick and found, he said, a wellington boot full of custard. He was totally natural and he became Mr Play School \u2013&#xa0;staying for 21 of the show's 24 years.</p> <p>We also had the very first black presenter in children's programmes, Paul Danquah, and a beautiful Italian called <a href=\"http://www.glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com/show/683/Marla+Landi/index.html\" title=\"\">Marla Landi</a>. She spoke English with a heavy accent, but she was very loveable and children adored her. When Eric Thompson came on board, a colleague said: \"You're right to have Eric, but do you know about his wife?\" So <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/oct/17/phyllida-law-family-values\" title=\"\">Phyllida Law</a> joined and became one of the most delightful presenters. She had the qualities I&#xa0;looked for, in that you'd really enjoy it&#xa0;if she came to tea. I didn't want presenters who lacked substance beyond what the programme gave them to do.</p> <p>At the time, people were becoming increasingly self-conscious about middle-class values. They thought our toys, like Humpty Dumpty, were too middle class. So we introduced a very ugly, beaten-about doll called Hamble (\"humble\"). The presenters disliked her intensely. During a break in shooting, Julie Stevens once made her do a striptease to music.</p> <h2><strong>Phyllida Law, presenter</strong></h2> <p>It was chaotic: filming five 30-minute programmes in two days. Although you had scripts, you improvised a lot. And you had to sing, of course, without laughing. I was permanently hysterical. I'd be terrified going in, wondering if I'd get through all the stress. But if I&#xa0;got frustrated, I'd just punch Hamble, the doll with the squashed face. She couldn't sit up and that's not helpful.</p> <p>You never knew what was going to hit you. If Eric, my husband, said something like \"Knick-knack up against a tree\", I would find it vaguely obscene and start to shriek with laughter. And anything could happen, with Plasticine or mice. We killed a mouse once. A beautiful little white mouse whose keeper came along to sedate it so that it slept. It was put on a&#xa0;velvet cushion and I had to present it&#xa0;to the king or queen. I think if you kissed it, it&#xa0;became a prince or something. But anyway, I do remember the whole thing because the poor mouse had too much sedative and died. It wasn't my fault, but I was walking towards the throne thinking: \"What if the children knew I was acting with a dead mouse?\"</p> <p>\u2022 Joy Whitby is giving a talk about her career at the <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/\" title=\"\">BFI</a>, London SE1, in February.</p>",
  "<p>Shortly after 10pm on 18 June 1994, Ireland were 1-0 up against Italy in the opening match of the 1994 World Cup. at the Giants Stadium in New Jersey. The second half had just kicked off, and inside the Heights Bar at Loughinisland, 21 miles south of Belfast, all eyes were on the television. The bar is tiny: there were 15 men inside, and it was packed.</p> <p>Aidan O'Toole, the owner's 23-year-old son, was serving. \"I heard the door open and then I just heard crack, crack, crack and felt a stabbing pain inside me,\" he recalls. \"I just ran. It was instinctive. I didn't know what was happening but I knew I had to get away.\"</p> <p>Others inside the bar turned when the door opened and saw two men in boiler suits, their faces hidden by balaclavas. One of the intruders dropped to one knee and fired three bursts from an automatic rifle. Barney Green was sitting with his back to the door, close enough for the gunmen to reach out and tap his shoulder had they wished. He took the first blast, with around nine rounds passing through him before striking other men. Green, a retired farmer, was 87.</p> <p>Green's nephew, Dan McCreanor, 59, another farmer, died alongside him. A second burst killed Malcolm Jenkinson, 53, who was at the bar, and Adrian Rogan, 34, who was trying to escape to the lavatory. A third burst aimed at a table to the right of the door missed Willie O'Hare but killed his son-in-law, Eamon Byrne, 39. O'Hare's son Patsy, 35, was also shot and died en route to hospital. Five men were injured: one, who lost part of a foot, would spend nine months in hospital.</p> <p>O'Toole returned to the bar from a back room after hearing the killers' car screech away. A bullet was lodged in his left kidney and a haze of gun smoke filled the room. But he could see clearly enough. \"There were bodies piled on top of each other. It was like a dream; a nightmare.\"</p> <p>Most of the victims had been hit several times. Thirty rounds were fired, and some had passed through one man, ricocheted around the tiny room, then struck a second. Adrian Rogan's father pushed his way into the bar and whispered a short prayer in his son's ear, knowing he was not going to survive.</p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loughinisland\" title=\"\">Loughinisland</a> had been scarcely touched by the Troubles. A village of 600 or so people, where Catholics and Protestants had lived side by side for generations, none of its sons or daughters had been killed or hurt before, and none had been accused of terrorist offences. It is not a republican area \u2013 many of its Catholic inhabitants were so uninterested in politics that they did not vote even for the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) \u2013 and Protestants often drank at the Heights. Only by chance were no Protestants killed or wounded that night.</p> <p>Ninety minutes after the attack, a loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), telephoned a radio station to claim responsibility.</p> <p><strong>Police promises</strong></p> <p>Despite years of death and destruction in Northern Ireland, people around the world were shocked by the slaughter at the Heights. The Queen, Pope John Paul&#xa0;II and Bill Clinton sent messages of sympathy. Local Protestant families visited their injured and traumatised neighbours in hospital, expressing shock and disgust.</p> <p>The police told the victims' families they would leave no stone unturned in their efforts to catch the killers and bring them to justice.</p> <p>The morning after the killings, the gunmen's getaway car, a red Triumph Acclaim, was found abandoned in a field seven miles from Loughinisland. The farmer who spotted it called the police at 10.04am. The recovery of such a vehicle was quite rare during the Troubles \u2013 paramilitaries often torched them to destroy forensic evidence \u2013 and police were soon at the scene to take possession. There was no forensic examination of the area around the car, however.</p> <p>A few weeks later, workmen found a holdall under a bridge a couple of miles from where the car had been found. Inside were three boiler suits, three balaclavas, three pairs of surgical gloves, three handguns, ammunition and a magazine. Not far from the bridge, police found a Czech-made VZ-58 assault rifle, which scientists confirmed was the weapon used to kill the men at the Heights.</p> <p>The same weapon had been used the previous October<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/catholic-shot-dead-in-ambush-attack-on-workmen-in-minibus-seen-as-loyalist-warning-to-workers-at-shorts-aerospace-factory-1510516.html\" title=\"\"> in a UVF attack on a van carrying Catholic painters to work</a> at Shorts aircraft and missile factory in Belfast, in which one man died and five others were wounded.</p> <p>In the months that followed the Loughinisland shootings, nine people were arrested and questioned. All nine were released without charge. A 10th was arrested and released the following year, and two more suspects were arrested for questioning a year after that, all released without charge. The police repeatedly assured the families that no stone would be left unturned.</p> <p>Emma Rogan was eight years old when her father, Adrian, was killed at the Heights. \"I was told that these bad men came into the bar, and that my daddy was dead. I didn't really know what they meant.\"</p> <p>As she grew up, she had no reason to doubt the police when they said they were doing everything in their power to catch the killers. \"We didn't question the police: that's what this area is like. If they said they would leave no stone unturned, you took that at face value.\"</p> <p>By the time the 10th anniversary of the killings came around, Rogan was anxious to learn more about her father's death, and hear of any progress the police had made. A series of meetings was organised between senior investigators of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the victims' relatives, and later more information emerged when the police ombudsman for Northern Ireland <a href=\"http://www.policeombudsman.org/Publicationsuploads/Loughinisland%20statement.pdf\" title=\"\">published a report in 2011</a> on the investigation. Relatives of the dead men came to the conclusion, as Rogan puts it, that \"they had treated us like mushrooms, keeping us in the dark for years and feeding us whatnot\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-403913414\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/12/1350057259661/A-memorial-plaque-in-the--001.jpg\" alt=\"A memorial plaque in the room where six men were murdered at the Heights Bar in Loughinisland\" width=\"320\" height=\"268\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A memorial plaque in the room where six men were murdered in a 1994 Loyalist attack on the Heights Bar in Loughinisland, County Down, Northern Ireland.

The morning after the killings, a Belfast police officer was asked to call at this person's home. The officer did so, but found the man was out. The officer then recorded the time of his visit as 9.30am - 34 minutes before the farmer had rung police to tell them he had discovered the car.</p> <p>Some time between 11am and noon, a second police officer \u2013 a detective with no connection to the murder inquiry \u2013 telephoned the second person in the ownership chain, and asked him to come to the local police station to give a statement. How this detective came to know that the car had passed through this man's hands is unclear. What is known, however, is that a statement was given, and that a note was attached to it, saying that the individual who gave it could be contacted only through the detective who took it.</p> <p>The Loughinisland families argue this amounts to evidence that the person who gave this statement \u2013 one of the people involved in supplying the car used by the killers \u2013 was a police informer.</p> <p>The Guardian has interviewed this man. He is Terry Fairfield, and today he runs a pub in the south of England. Fairfield confirms that he was a member of the UVF at the time, but denies he was a police informer. He says he did subsequently receive several thousand pounds from the detective, for helping him take a firearm and some explosives out of circulation. He accepts that being invited to attend a police station, rather than being arrested, was highly unorthodox. The detective says he had known Fairfield for years and contacted him after hearing of the Loughinisland shooting, but that only members of the murder inquiry could decide whether to arrest him.</p> <p>A second man, who is widely suspected locally of having been in the getaway car, and who is also alleged to have been an informer, has also told the Guardian that he has never been arrested.</p> <p>The families also question the failure to take samples from some of the people arrested for questioning. The Guardian understands that at least five of the men arrested in the months after the shootings were not fingerprinted before being released without charge. No DNA swabs were taken from either of the two people arrested in 1996.</p> <p>One man, Gorman McMullan, who has been <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/50616601/Sunday-World-also-Gagged-by-Northumbria-Police-Top-Cops-Gag-Newspaper-What-the-hell-have-have-Chief-Superintendent-Chris-Thomson-Temporary\" title=\"\">named as a suspect in a Northern Ireland newspaper</a>, was arrested the month after the shootings and released without charge. He was one of the people who were released without being fingerprinted and no DNA swab was taken. McMullan firmly denies that he has ever been to Loughinisland or that he was ever in the getaway car, and no further action was taken against him in connection with the shootings. He acknowledges however that he was \"involved in the conflict\".</p> <p>The police admitted to the families at one of their meetings that they had handed the getaway car to a scrap metal firm to be crushed and baled. They said this had been done because the vehicle was taking up too much space in a police station yard. That decision means it can never again be tested for comparison with samples taken from any new suspects.</p> <p><strong>Families' disbelief</strong></p> <p>Emma Rogan and Aidan O'Toole cannot believe that the destruction of the car or other failings in the investigation were an accident. They believe that this is evidence of police collusion. \"They knew exactly what they were doing,\" Rogan says.</p> <p>The families lodged a complaint with the police ombudsman for Northern Ireland. When the ombudsman, Al Hutchinson, published <a href=\"http://www.policeombudsman.org/Publicationsuploads/Loughinisland%20statement.pdf\" title=\"\">his report</a>, it contained mild criticism of an investigation that displayed \"a lack of cohesive and focused effort\". To the anger of the families, it refused to state whether or not police informants were suspected of involvement and appeared to gloss over the forensic failures. It concluded that the destruction of the car was \"inappropriate\", rather than evidence of corruption or collusion.</p> <p>The report was widely condemned in Northern Ireland. Hutchinson agreed to leave his post, and his successor is now reviewing the report. There will be no examination of the arms shipment, however, as the ombudsman's remit extends only to the police, not the army.</p> <p>Much of the suspicion about British involvement in the 1987 arms shipment revolves around <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/apr/17/guardianobituaries.northernireland\" title=\"\">Brian Nelson</a>, a former soldier who joined the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) in the early 70s. In 1985, Nelson offered himself as an informant to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Research_Unit\" title=\"\">Force Research Unit</a> (FRU), a covert unit within the army's intelligence corps that recruited and ran agents in Northern Ireland. He quit the UDA the following year and moved to Germany with his wife and children. The FRU, operating with the approval of MI5, approached Nelson in Germany and persuaded him to return to Belfast to rejoin the UDA as an army agent.</p> <p>For the next three years, Nelson was paid \u00a3200 a week by the government while operating as the UDA's intelligence officer, helping to select targets for assassination. He informed his army handlers in advance of attacks: only two were halted, while at least three people were killed and attempts were made on the lives of at least eight more.</p> <p>A detailed account of this extraordinary operation appears in <a href=\"http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/collusion/cory/cory03finucane.pdf\" title=\"\">a report on the loyalist killing of the Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane</a> that Peter Cory, a retired Canadian supreme court judge, prepared at the request of the government in 2004. An FRU report from July 1985 discloses that the army paid Nelson's travel expenses when he travelled to Durban in South Africa that year to make initial contact with an arms dealer. \"The [British] army appears to have at least encouraged Nelson in his attempt to purchase arms in South Africa for the UDA,\" Cory concludes. \"Nelson certainly went to South Africa in 1985 to meet an arms dealer. His expenses were paid by FRU. The army appears to have been committed to facilitating Nelson's acquisition of weapons, with the intention that they would be intercepted at some point en route to Northern Ireland.\"</p> <p>Nelson is said to have told the FRU that the UDA possessed insufficient funds at that time to purchase any arms. \"The evidence with regard to the completion of the arms transaction is frail and contradictory,\" Cory says. As a result, \"whether the transaction was consummated remains an open question\".</p> <p>In July 1987, the funds to purchase a large consignment of weapons were secured with the robbery of more than \u00a3325,000 from a branch of Northern Bank in Portadown, 30 miles south-west of Belfast. The proceeds of the robbery were to be used to purchase weapons that were to be split three ways between the UDA, the UVF and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Resistance\" title=\"\">Ulster Resistance</a> (UR), a paramilitary organisation set up by unionists in response to the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement.</p> <p>What happened next is described by a former senior employee with South Africa's Armscor, a man who was intimately involved in the plot to smuggle the weapons into Northern Ireland. According to this source, officials in South Africa introduced a senior figure within UR to one of the corporation's representatives in Europe, an American arms dealer called Douglas Bernhardt.</p> <p>In October 1987, Bernhardt is said to have flown to Gatwick airport for a face-to-face meeting with a senior UDA commander, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McMichael\" title=\"\">John McMichael</a>, after which couriers carried money from the bank raid, in cash, to Bernhardt's office in Geneva.</p> <p>Bernhardt was not told where the money had come from, according to the Armscor source. \"When you get that sort of dirty banknote, you don't ask,\" the source says. Bernhardt obtained a bank draft which was then sent to an arms dealer in Beirut, who had obtained the weapons from a Lebanese militia.</p> <p>As the operation progressed, according to the Armscor source, Bernhardt would regularly call his UR contact at his place of work. This man would then call back from a payphone, and they would talk in a simple code, referring to the weapons as \"the parcel of fruit\". At each stage, Bernhardt is said to have been told that the arrangements needed to be agreed by McMichael and by his intelligence officer \u2013 Brian Nelson. \"Everything had to be run by the head of intelligence.\"</p> <p>Bernhardt is said then to have travelled by ship to Beirut, where arrangements were made to pack the weapons into a shipping container labelled as a consignment of ceramic floor tiles. Bills of lading and a certificate of origin were organised, and the weapons were shipped to Belfast docks via Liverpool.</p> <p>\"There were at least a couple of hundred Czech-made AKs \u2013 the VZ-58,\" the Armscor source recalls. \"And 90-plus Browning-type handguns: Hungarian-made P9Ms. About 30,000 rounds of 7.62 x 39mm ammunition, not the 51mm Nato rounds. Plus a dozen or so RPGs, and a few hundred fragmentation grenades.\"</p> <p>Sources within both the police and the UVF have confirmed that one of the VZ-58s was used at Loughinisland.</p> <p>According to the Armscor source, the UR member who dealt with Bernhardt was Noel Little, a civil servant and former British soldier. Now in his mid-60s and living quietly in an affluent Belfast suburb, Little denies this. \"My position is that I wasn't involved,\" Little says. But he adds: \"I would deny it even if I was.\"</p> <p>Little confirms, however, that he was a founder member of UR, and a central figure within the organisation at the time that the weapons arrived in Belfast. He also appears to possess detailed knowledge of the way in which the arms were smuggled and distributed.</p> <p>The weapons arrived in Belfast in December 1987, a few days before McMichael was killed by an IRA car bomb. Early in the new year, they were split three ways at a farmhouse in County Armagh. The UDA lost its entire slice of the pie within minutes: its share of about 100 weapons was loaded into the boot of two hire cars that were stopped a few minutes later at a police roadblock near Portadown. The three occupants were later jailed, with their leader, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davy_Payne\" title=\"\">Davy Payne</a>, receiving a 19-year sentence.</p> <p>The following month, police recovered around half the UVF's weapons after a tip-off led them to an outhouse on the outskirts of north Belfast. Fairfield says he recalls being shown what remained of the UVF's new arsenal, in storage at a house in the city that was being renovated. \"I made the mistake of touching one,\" he says, adding that this could result in him being linked to the October 1993 killing outside the Shorts factory.</p> <p>Little was also arrested, after his telephone number was found written on the back of Payne's hand. \"John McMichael had given it to him, in case he got into any trouble in Armagh,\" Little says. \"I lost three-quarters of a stone [4.75kg] during the seven days I was questioned. The police put me under extreme psychological pressure.\" Eventually, he was released without charge.</p> <p>Little says that while UR redistributed a few of its weapons \u2013 \"there were some deals around the edges\" \u2013 most of its consignment was kept intact.</p> <p>\"They were never used. They were for the eventuality of the British just walking away \u2013 doing an Algeria \u2013 after the Anglo-Irish agreement was signed.\" As far as he is aware, the consignment has never been decommissioned.</p> <p><strong>Dramatic arrest</strong></p> <p>The following year saw Little arrested again, this time in France, in dramatic fashion. He had travelled to Paris with two fellow loyalists, James King and Samuel Quinn, to meet Bernhardt and a South African intelligence officer operating under the name Daniel Storm. Officers of the French security agency, Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire (DST), seized the three Ulstermen and the South African in a raid on a room at the Hilton International, at the same moment that Bernhardt was being grabbed in the foyer of the H\u00f4tel George-V, and lifted bodily, according to one witness, out of the building and into a waiting car.</p> <p>The five had been caught red-handed attempting to trade stolen parts from the sighting system of a ground-to-air missile that was under development at the Shorts factory. The apartheid regime wanted to use the parts in the development of its own missile for use in Angola, where its ground forces were vulnerable to attack by Cuban-piloted MiGs. \"This deal was about speed,\" says the Armscor source. \"If you've got Cuban-piloted jets whacking your troops in border wars, you don't have the luxury of saying: 'We'll have a research programme over time.' You've got to speed up the R&amp;D.\"</p> <p>Storm was set free after claiming diplomatic immunity, while the others were interrogated in the basement of the DST's headquarters in the 15th arrondissement. \"I was slapped about a little,\" says Little. \"But not too much.\" The DST told Bernhardt it had listened in on a meeting the previous night, through a bug in the chandelier of the room at the George-V where the men had gathered. \"They knew all about the fruit code used in 1987,\" the Armscor source says. \"They thought the talk about pineapples was a huge joke. They must have been monitoring the phone calls. And they knew all about Lebanon.</p> <p>\"My guess is that the British were intercepting those phone calls. But the British didn't get all the weapons. How much did they know in advance? Why didn't they move more quickly? Maybe they were perfectly happy to have that material \u2026 sort of 'arrive', and put into the hands of the loyalists. Christ knows, the IRA had had enough of their own shipments, everywhere from Boston to Tripoli.\"</p> <p>Noel Little also suspects the British turned a blind eye to the 1987 arms shipment. \"It is a theory I can't discount,\" he says. \"Brian Nelson was inserted into the UDA as an agent, he wasn't a recruited member. Ho w could he know about it and not tell his handler?\"</p> <p>Little believes that his attempt to hand over stolen missile technology to Armscor in Paris \u2013 straying into \"secrets and commerce\", as he puts it \u2013 would have been a step too far for the British authorities, obliging them to tip off the French.</p> <p>After eight months on remand, the four men were brought to court charged with arms trafficking, handling stolen goods and terrorism-related conspiracy. Bernhardt told the court that he had helped arrange the Lebanese arms deal for loyalist paramilitaries in 1987. The four were sentenced to time served and fined between 20,000 and 100,000 francs (\u00a32,000-\u00a310,000 then).</p> <p>Brian Nelson was finally arrested in January 1990 after John Stevens, then deputy chief constable of Cambridgeshire, had been brought in to investigate collusion between the security forces and loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland. While awaiting trial, Nelson wrote a journal in which he recounted his time as an army agent inside the UDA. \"I was bitten by a bug ... hooked is probably a more appropriate word. One becomes enmeshed in a web of intrigue, conspiracies, confidences, dangers ...\"</p> <p>After flying to Durban in 1985, he wrote, his South African contacts had asked whether he would be able to obtain a missile from Shorts. Two years later, while talking about the South African connection with \"Ronnie\", his FRU handler, he had been told that \"because of the deep suspicion a seizure would have aroused, to protect me it had been decided to let the first shipment into the country untouched\". Nelson added that \"Ronnie\" assured him that the arms consignment would be under surveillance.</p> <p>In 1993, an intelligence source told the BBC that this had happened: the consignment had indeed been under surveillance by a number of agencies, but the wrong port was watched, with the result that the weapons slipped through.At Nelson's eventual court appearance, a plea deal resulted in Nelson being jailed for 10 years after he admitted 20 offences, including conspiracy to murder. Murder charges were dropped. More than 40 other people were also convicted of terrorism offences as a result of the Stevens investigation. They did not include any of the intelligence officers for whom Nelson worked.</p> <p>Stevens' investigation team was well aware of concerns surrounding the importation of the weapons. Members of the team talked to former Armscor officials in South Africa, but concluded that an investigation into the matter was so unlikely to produce any results as to be fruitless. However, a senior member of the inquiry team says he believes it feasible that the UK authorities could have been involved in bringing the weapons into Belfast \u2013 or at least turned a blind eye. \"It's not at all far-fetched,\" he says.</p> <p>By the time of the Loughinisland massacre, loyalist gunmen with access to the Armscor arsenal were killing at least as many people as the IRA. Czech-made VZ-58 assault rifles were used in many of the killings. A few weeks after the shootings at the Heights Bar, the IRA<a href=\"http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/peace/docs/ira31894.htm\" title=\"\"> announced a ceasefire</a>.</p> <p>Many in Northern Ireland are convinced that the importation of the Armscor weapons, and the large numbers of killings that followed, contributed greatly to the IRA's decision. Among them is Noel Little, who says: \"There's no doubt that that shipment did change things.\"</p> <p>Increasingly, the IRA was forced to defend itself against attacks by loyalists, it was diverted into targeting loyalist paramilitaries rather than police officers or soldiers, and it came under pressure from nationalists as more and more Catholic people were slaughtered. To Little's way of thinking, the Armscor weapons \"tipped the balance against the IRA and eventually forced them to sue for peace\". And while he accepts \u2013 and says he deplores \u2013 the slaughter of innocent people at Loughinisland and elsewhere, he adds: \"Innocent bystanders are killed in every war.\"</p> <p>Six weeks after the IRA's announcement, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q80jDS8MbE\" title=\"\">loyalist paramilitaries announced</a> their own ceasefire.</p> <p>With the Loughinisland families no nearer to discovering the truth about the deaths of their loved ones following publication of the ombudsman's report, they embarked on their civil actions against the Ministry of Defence and the police in January this year. A letter of claim sent to the MoD says the claim is based in part on \"the army's knowledge of and facilitation of the shipment\", while one sent to the Police Service of Northern Ireland says the claim arises from a series of failings, including \"closing off investigative opportunities\" and \"the destruction of vital evidence\".</p> <p>Their lawyer, Niall Murphy, says: \"The experience of these six families demonstrates that the current mechanisms for truth recovery do not work.\"</p> <p>Rogan and O'Toole remain tormented by the events of June 1994. \"The people who died in this room didn't know anything about the Troubles, and yet they were slaughtered,\" says Rogan. O'Toole, who still has a bullet lodged in his kidney, becomes emotional when he walks into the Heights Bar. \"It's guilt,\" he whispers. \"They died in here, while I was keeping the bar.\"</p> <p>Both say they are angered even more by the evidence of inaction and failure that they have discovered in recent years, and by the signs of collusion that have slipped slowly to the surface, than they are about the killings themselves.</p> <p>And after 18 years, both use the same phrase to describe the way they believe their friends and relatives were regarded, both by the gunmen and by those institutions they looked to for protection: \"They were expendable.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Obama and Romney campaigns have contacted the Commission on Presidential Debates to voice concerns over the role of the moderator, Candy Crowley, in Tuesday's second encounter between the two candidates.</p> <p>The president and his Republican challenger had agreed that the town hall-style debate in Hofstra, New York, would mostly involve them fielding queries from audience members, with limited participation from Crowley, CNN's chief political correspondent.</p> <p>Crowley, however, appears to have other ideas, and has given a series of interviews over recent days stating her intention to follow up on audience members questions, rather than merely be \"a fly on the wall\".</p> <p>Both candidates reached agreement over the terms of the debate in early October, with a memorandum of the agreement, obtained by Time, showing that Obama and Romney intended for the moderator to have little influence over the topics discussed:</p> <p>\"In managing the two-minute comment periods, the moderator will not rephrase the question or open a new topic. \u2026 The moderator will not ask follow-up questions or comment on either the questions asked by the audience or the answers of the candidates during the debate or otherwise intervene in the debate except to acknowledge the questioners from the audience or enforce the time limits, and invite candidate comments during the two-minute response period.\"</p> <p>However as the moderator Crowley, a veteran political journalist who will be the first woman to moderate a presidential debate in 20 years, is not strictly bound by the agreement. Time reported that the agreement between the campaigns merely states that \"the commission shall provide each moderator with a copy of this agreement and shall use its best efforts to ensure that the moderators implement the terms of this agreement\".</p> <p>It appears to have been comments made by Crowley over the past week which have spooked both candidates' campaigns into contacting the commission. Crowley, who anchors CNN's State of the Union programme and has covered US politics since the 1970s, has given repeated interviews insisting she will not simply be holding the microphone when her moment in the spotlight comes on Tuesday.</p> <p>In an on-air discussion with CNN colleague Suzanne Malveaux on Friday 5 October, Crowley said debate moderators \"need to take control\" on occasion, adding that \"you want the conversation to move\". Just last week she told the Huffington Post that she would hold Obama and Romney to account, saying she hoped she would be able to \"add to this conversation\".</p> <p>\"I hope that I can say: 'Well, now that you've said that, though, doesn't that bring up this?'\"</p> <p>On Thursday Crowley gave a further indication of her intentions during a conversation on CNN with Wolf Blitzer. \"It's also very hard to evade a question that comes from a town hall person,\" she said during a discussion of the format and how the candidates will respond. \"The nice thing will be if the town hall person asks apples and they answer oranges, I go: 'Wait a second, the question was about apples, let's talk about that.'\"</p> <p>Crowley is to be the first woman since Carole Simpson, in 1992, to moderate a presidential debate and has been subject to huge media attention since the announcement was made. Her appointment <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/13/candy-crowley-moderate-presidential-debates\">came after three teenage girls from New Jersey</a> set up an online petition lobbying for a female moderator which was signed over 100,000 times.</p> <p>But while Crowley's appointment was championed in some quarters as an example of increasing equality, others complained that as the moderator of the town hall debate, Crowley would have less opportunity than other moderators to quiz the candidates.</p> <p>Simpson, who was the third woman and first minority to moderate a presidential debate, herself complained about Crowley's assignment in a piece for the <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/09/on-being-the-lady-with-the-microphone/262160/\">Atlantic magazine in September</a>. Simpson said that when she moderated the 1992 debate, which was also town hall style, between Bill Clinton and George H Bush, her role was merely \"to hold the microphone for each of the citizen questioners\".</p> <p>\"Candy Crowley will also moderate the town hall format debate, and she will operate under the same restrictions I had. However, the two male moderators of the other debates will ask their own questions of the candidates, face-to-face, eye-to-eye,\" Simpson said.</p> <p>Crowley has said she that while she understands the concerns of Simpson \u2013 who is a close friend \u2013 she hopes Tuesday will \"add to our collective resume as female journalists\". </p> <p>Crowley was born in Michigan on 26 December 1948, but grew up in Missouri, where her father worked in the furniture business. She studied at Principia college in Illinois before transferring to Randolph-Macon woman's college in Lynchburg, Virginia, where she graduated with a degree in English.</p> <p>Her first journalism job was as a newsroom assistant with DC-based radio station Wash-FM, and she later became a White House correspondent for the Associated Press, covering most of the Reagan era before moving to NBC News' DC bureau and then onto CNN in 1987.</p> <p>Although Crowley has covered the presidential campaigns of George Bush senior, George W Bush, Bill Clinton, John Kerry, Barack Obama and others, she said she will still be nervous come Tuesday. \"I feel pressured, period,\" she told the Huffington Post. She practises transcendental meditation to deal with stress and has been \"getting more bunkerish as time goes on\", preparing intensely for the Hofstra event.</p> <p>For all the pressure and speculation ahead of Tuesday, however, ultimately Crowley knows where the main focus will be.</p> <p>\"In a way, knowing this debate is all about the candidates is something I tell myself to deal with the stress,\" she told Politico on Friday. \"I tell myself: 'Relax this is about getting these guys to talk. It's not about you.'\"</p>",
  "<p>Allegations that the government helped to arm loyalist gangs with a large arsenal of weapons at the height of Northern Ireland's Troubles are to surface in court proceedings arising from one of the most notorious massacres of the 30-year conflict.</p> <p>The Ministry of Defence and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) are being sued by relatives of six men murdered by a loyalist gunman who opened fire inside a bar crowded with people watching football on television in Loughinisland, County Down, in June 1994. While the families are claiming compensation, they say their aim is to uncover the truth about the killings.</p> <p>The authorities are alleged to have assisted \u2013 or at least turned a blind eye \u2013 as about 300 automatic rifles and pistols, hundreds of grenades and an estimated 30,000 rounds of ammunition were smuggled into Belfast in 1987. One of the rifles, a Czech-made VZ-58 assault rifle, was used in the attack in the village.</p> <p>According to a number of those involved in the shipment, the weapons were provided by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armscor_(South_Africa)\" title=\"\">Armscor</a>, the arms sales and procurement corporation of apartheid-era South Africa. A deal was struck between Armscor and leading loyalists after a British agent, who infiltrated the paramilitary Ulster Defence Association (UDA) for the army and MI5, visited South Africa in 1985.</p> <p>The agent was shopping for arms for the UDA. But the MoD has conceded that the trip was funded by the taxpayer, with an army intelligence unit paying his expenses.</p> <p>There is no conclusive proof that the agent's South Africa trip led directly to the arsenal being smuggled into Belfast two years later. But Niall Murphy, lawyer for the families, said: \"We are confident that evidence of British involvement does exist, and we look forward to applying to the high court for its disclosure.\"</p> <p>A number of people in South Africa and Belfast who were involved in the talks after the agent's visit told the Guardian they believe the government must have been aware that an arms deal was being arranged, and took no action to prevent the weapons from being smuggled into Northern Ireland, where they were divided between three paramilitary groups.</p> <p>Within weeks of the consignment arriving in Northern Ireland, loyalist gunman Michael Stone was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCfjifKmk2U\" title=\"\">hurling several of the grenades</a> and firing one of the pistols in an attack that claimed the lives of three people at the funeral of three IRA members at Milltown cemetery in west Belfast. From then on, the number of killings by loyalists rose sharply: during the six years before the weapons were landed, loyalists had killed about 70 people; in the six years that followed, they killed about 230.</p> <p>Many of the victims were Catholics who had no involvement with the conflict, and as the death toll mounted the IRA came under increasing pressure to call a ceasefire.</p> <p>There is reason to believe that a number of the paramilitaries connected to the attack were police informers.</p> <p>There are serious concerns about the way the Loughinisland killings were investigated, with a subsequent inquiry by the police ombudsman establishing that police failed to take some suspects' fingerprints or DNA samples. Police have admitted that one key piece of evidence \u2013 the getaway car \u2013 was destroyed. There is no evidence that any officer sought or gave permission for this to be done.</p> <p>The families of the dead men are also bringing civil proceedings against the PSNI after the police ombudsman in Belfast examined the initial investigation and then produced a report which was widely criticised for refusing to acknowledge whether police informers were involved in the massacre. Murphy said: \"The experience of these six families demonstrates that the current mechanisms for truth recovery do not work.\"</p> <p>It appears likely that the case will be heard under the terms of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/25/secret-courts-the-essential-guide\" title=\"\">controversial secret justice proposals</a>, which will allow government lawyers to keep such evidence secret, disclosed only to a judge behind closed doors, where it cannot be examined or challenged by the families' lawyers.</p> <p>Although ministers maintain that the <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2012-2013/0027/13027.pdf\" title=\"\">justice and security bill</a> is intended to protect intelligence sharing with foreign governments, its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/09/secret-justice-bill\" title=\"\">critics insist its true purpose</a> is to conceal evidence of government wrongdoing in cases such as this.</p> <p>An MoD spokesman said: \"There is not much we can say at this stage beyond confirming that a claim has been made. This will be dealt with in accordance with the normal process \u2013 gathering evidence and presenting it to the courts.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the PSNI said: \"We would be unable to comment as this is an ongoing legal case.\"</p>",
  "<p>A riot officer told a young black man under arrest in the back of a police van, \"the problem with you is that you will always be a nigger,\" a court has heard.</p> <p>PC Alex MacFarlane also told Mauro Demetrio, 21,\"You will always have black skin colour\" and \"Don't hide behind your colour\", in comments the arrested man recorded on his mobile phone in east London last August, which were played to Southwark crown court on Monday.</p> <p>The 53-year-old Metropolitan police constable was deliberately trying to \"put Mr Demetrio in his place by demeaning him and distressing him\", Duncan Atkinson, prosecuting, told the jury.</p> <p>He said: \"It is clear that this abuse was racially motivated, and was targeted and was intended. Such words were designed to cause \u2013 and did cause \u2013 distress and insult. They were designed to suggest to Mr Demetrio that he was inferior to the officer because of the colour of his skin.\"</p> <p>In other comments saved on the phone, another officer in the van called Demetrio \"a scumbag\" and said he had throttled him \"because you're a cunt\". The recording was first revealed by the Guardian in March.</p> <p>MacFarlane has insisted his comments were not intended to be offensive and he had \"wanted to try to defuse the situation\" after Demetrio became agitated. In police interviews earlier this year, sections of which were read to the court, the officer said he had previously told other young black men not to hide behind their skin colour and this advice generally received a \"positive response\".</p> <p>The incident began on the early evening of 11 August last year, as days of rioting in the city began to tail off. Demetrio was in a car with a friend in east London when he was stopped for driving erratically by the police van carrying MacFarlane and about nine other officers.</p> <p>Police said they could smell cannabis in the car and handcuffed Demetrio, taking him to their van. No drugs were later found but Demetrio was arrested after a radio check revealed he was wanted over two separate warrants, the court heard.</p> <p>In the van, Demetrio alleges, he was part-strangled and shoved against a window by another officer, Atkinson said. A doctor found evidence of neck bruising but no charges were brought in connection with this,</p> <p>Demetrio pulled his phone from a pocket and recorded an initial exchange with the other policeman, who responded to his shouts with, \"Give it a rest, you're just a scumbag.\" Asked by Demetrio why he tried to strangle him this officer replied, \"I did strangle you.\" Asked why again, he replied: \"Because you're a cunt,\" before adding that Demetrio had been struggling and kicking.</p> <p>Giving evidence, Demetrio, of Beckton, east London, said he began the recording after enduring other abuse and mockery from some of the officers, including references to them going on holiday with his mother and receiving oral sex from her and renditions of songs including The Wheels on the Bus.</p> <p>After recording the first exchange, Demetrio said, he started the phone again and taped the conversation with MacFarlane. Asked how the officer's words made him feel he said, \"It made me feel like shit, really. At that point it was, like, it can't get any worse. I felt violated.\"</p> <p>After the comments Demetrio could be heard repeatedly shouting MacFarlane's lapel badge number and telling him he would lose his job.</p> <p>Demetrio accepted the tapes showed him shouting and being abusive \u2013 at one point he calls the officer who allegedly throttled him a \"fat mug\" \u2013 but said this was a response to the physical and verbal abuse he experienced.</p> <p>Atkinson told the court that in three initial police interviews earlier this year about his comments to Demetrio, MacFarlane said only that he had \"engaged him in conversation\" but that they began arguing. He said: \"Sadly, it ended up in a bit of a slanging match between us. It all became a bit unpleasant.\"</p> <p>On being played the recording during a fourth interview MacFarlane said he believed he had heard Demetrio first use \"nigger\" when asking why he had been arrested but his white friend set free. MacFarlane, based at Forest Gate station, east London, said he had repeated the term, \"thinking, probably wrongly, it was acceptable in the context of our exchange\".</p> <p>Richard Atchley, defending, told the court that other officers in the van would testify that Demetrio \"showered\" them in abuse, some of it racist, homophobic and sexual in tone, including the repeated use of \"white cunt\". He stopped such language when he began recording. Demetrio said he could not recall using such terms.</p> <p>MacFarlane was simply trying to persuade Demetrio that he was not being targeted due to his race, Atchley said, as shown by MacFarlane's later comment, \"Be proud of who you are.\" Atchley asked Demetrio if he knew that this was once a Black Panther slogan. Demetrio replied: \"Your points don't make sense.\"</p> <p>The court also heard from Rob Jones, who gave MacFarlane diversity and race relations training in 2001. Asked about the use of \"nigger\", he said: \"No matter what is said in the street, no Metropolitan police officer should ever use that kind of word.\"</p> <p>MacFarlane denies intending to cause harassment, alarm or distress to Demetrio and using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour.</p> <p>The trial, which is expected to last two to three days, continues.</p>",

There's an old dictum in speechwriting that the key to a good speech is \"tell 'em what you're gonna tell 'em; tell 'em; and then tell 'em again.\" The idea is to hammer on a central point, but also, drill down your argument to something that is easily digestible.</p> <p>While Mitt Romney has lately demonstrated the physical characteristics of Jello when it comes to nailing down his policy positions, Obama's job should be easier than it seems. Romney has, throughout his presidential campaign, espoused positions that are to the right of the median American voter: he wants to cut taxes on the wealthy; he would fundamentally transform Medicare; he wants to repeal Obamacare fully; and his position on choice and immigration run afoul of women and Hispanic voters.</p> <p>The key for Obama, then, is to remind voters, over and over, that Romney is a hard-right conservative who would take the country in a very different and uncertain direction. He failed to do this in the first debate, and instead, let his GOP opponent get away with engaging in a nationally televised facelift. That Romney had faint rhetorical echoes of the technocratic Republican who was Governor of Massachusetts.</p> <p>But those soothing efforts were not a true reflection of Romney's policy positions. Romney might offer a smokescreen about the impact of his 20% across the board tax cut, for example, but the facts are the facts \u2013 the math doesn't add up. Romney might say he supported the auto bailout, but the op-ed he penned titled \"Let Detroit Go Bankrupt\" suggests otherwise. For Obama to succeed, he needs to do something similar to what his running-mate Joe Biden did last week in the vice-presidential debate: he needs to stick to the facts and remind voters that the GOP ticket is not what it seems.</p> <p>Do that, and forget the extraneous wonky arguments he made in Denver, and Obama will avoid the universal panning his first debate performance received.</p> <p><em>Michael Cohen is a US political columnist for the Guardian and Observer and author of Live from the Campaign Trail</em></p> <h2>The stylist, <a href=\"www.guardian.co.uk/profile/megan-collins\">Megan Collins</a>: 'Michelle should cut Barack's tie in half just beforehand'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397791640\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350314913431/megancollins_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Megan Collins\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Because the second debate will be conducted in a town hall format, the president should wear something he can move in. He should feel comfortable standing or sitting, and walking around stage holding a microphone.</p> <p>That said, President Obama did everything right \u2013 sartorially speaking \u2013 in the first debate. It's hard to argue with either candidate's choice of a charcoal, two-button suit with notch lapels. While I'd suggest that both men would be better served by a flat front pant rather than one with pleats, I understand that old habits, especially among politicians, die hard.</p> <p>The president's suit fit well, with subtle pick-stitching defining the lapel and a natural shoulder hugging his frame. The jacket's double vents felt modern, as did its slightly shorter length. His point collar dress shirt fit snugly, but not too tight, around his neck. His polished dress shoes were neither too square, nor too pointy. His flag pin: present, but not showy. Even the dimple in his (unsurprisingly Democrat blue) tie gets an \"A\" for textbook menswear polish.</p> <p>With his outfit in order, the president, then, needs to work on presenting himself as a more passionate, determined, confident candidate at the second debate. In short, he needs to upgrade his attitude.</p> <p>I'm reminded of a great West Wing episode where the First Lady, played by Stockard Channing, took scissors to her husband's tie just moments before a debate. The president, played by Martin Sheen, had to hustle to find new neckwear from someone on his staff with less than a minute to air. The frenzy provided him with a fantastic energy during the debate.</p> <p>I think if someone can convince Michelle to cut Barack's tie in half before Tuesday night's town hall, he'll do ten times better in this debate than the last.</p> <p><em>Megan Collins runs <a href=\"http://stylegirlfriend.com/\">Style Girlfriend</a>, a website about guys' style from a female perspective</em></p> <h2>The body language expert, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/christopher-kowal\">Christopher Kowal</a>: 'His non-verbal cues need to express sincerity and empathy'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397791641\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350321940363/Chris_Kowalheadshot.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Kowal\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Emotional connection is one of the major keys in attracting and motivating voters. It's easier to vote for a person we feel a connection with. So, while having an articulate and rational vision is imperative for candidates, voters are increasingly judging them on their ability to emotionally connect with them.</p> <p>After the charismatic administrations of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, voters have a strong desire for leaders who move them emotionally and connect with them, especially as they face economic and security uncertainties. Clinton has a strong ability to show empathy. Think of his \"I feel your pain\" statement, made with a sincere and concerned facial gesture that matched those words.</p> <p>The last debate performance by President Barack Obama is a perfect case study in the area of connection. Critics suggested Obama was disengaged, perhaps even angry. My own analysis suggests that he was emotionally flat. </p> <p>During the next two debates, it is critical for Obama not only to articulate his vision for the next four years, but also to connect that vision with the majority of American voters. His facial expressions and other non-verbal cues need to express sincerity and empathy. He must reflect the emotions of his base and of the ever-so-important independent voter.</p> <p>Voters are worried about the economy and angry at the failings of Washington. They need to feel reassured that the politician understands what is important to them and will have their best interests in mind.</p> <p>Both nominees for president lack a natural ability to truly emotionally connect with voters. This has created mistrust and uncertainty. The presidential hopeful who wins the next debate will be the one who truly shows that he feels what the voters are feeling.</p> <p><em>Christopher Kowal is an assistant professor of consumer science at Purdue University, Indiana, specialising in non-verbal communication and emotional cues</em></p> <h2>The Democratic strategist, <a href=\"www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alex-slater\">Alex Slater</a>: 'The worst thing Obama could do is over-compensate'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397791642\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/12/7/1291745438055/Alex-Slater-002.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Slater\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Slater</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The president doesn't have an easy job ahead of him in this second debate. Unlike much of the Democratic establishment, I don't believe that expectations for his performance are low, whatever his campaign tried to spin on the Sunday talkshows. On the contrary, if Obama doesn't deliver a \"slam dunk\" on Tuesday, we'll see another round of liberal hand-wringing and conservative victory laps. The polls will become unpredictable, at best.</p> <p>As Democratic strategist Mike Feldman told Piers Morgan on Saturday night, tomorrow's debate will be a 3-D game of chess, between the candidates, the moderator, the town-hall participants and the undecided voters tuning in from swing states.</p> <p>So my advice to the president is this: do not overreact. In the first debate, Obama left Romney's blatantly false assertions and attacks go unchecked. Certainly, he was devoid of the energy and verve Americans have come to expect. That can't happen on Tuesday. But the worst thing Obama could do is over-compensate by becoming, as Feldman put it, \"the incredible hulk\". The risk is that the president, so intent on going after Governor Romney, could be perceived as a bully. Given Romney's affable demeanor in the first debate, the contrast could be considerable.</p> <p>The president has to use the town-hall format to his advantage. Obama's not quite the college professor he's declared to be. In fact, he's a great communicator, especially in one-on-one situations. He has the power both to empathize with the audience members while drawing a contrast with Mitt Romney. And it's that contrast that will put Romney in a difficult position.</p> <p>After all the fact-checking of the first debate, it's going to be very hard for the governor to continue making spurious arguments. It'll be even harder when facing town-hall participants. Downright making up facts in a moderated debate is one thing; lying to the face of real Americans is quite another. Obama has the advantage of his facts being true. It's up to him to use that advantage without being the town-hall bully.</p> <p><em>Alex Slater is a Democratic strategist and principal of the political consultancy <a href=\"http://www.clydestrategies.com/\">Clyde Strategies</a></em></p> <h2>The sport psychologist, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/roland-carlstedt\">Roland Carlstedt</a>: 'High self-esteem can have an insidious flip-side'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397791643\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350310092096/rolandcarlstedt_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Roland Carlstedt\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Presidential debates are not really debates as debates are defined or should be. They have devolved to the extent that most debate performers in our recent history would have been kicked off high-school debate teams, where facts rule, not theatrics and superficial attempts to seduce, as opposed to accurately inform undecided voters. Debate victors are declared on the basis of pundit impressions of body language, confidence, forcefulness and self-control ,among many other behaviors and what are smoke-and-mirror-based attempts to appear more presidential. In the end, it's more about role-playing than the issues in an America that appears to be easily smitten and swayed by that presidential-looking haircut, chiseled facial features and the ability to use the right tone, verbal inflection and retorts no matter how absurd and removed from reality.</p> <p>As such, an individual like Barack Obama may be at an inherent disadvantage when debating an individual who is all too willing to focus on appearing to be presidential, one who will say anything, even if it means defying logic, distorting the facts, switching positions and even denying having said things that have been recorded for all to hear. Mitt Romey has been accused of doing all of the above. In the first debate, Obama seemed befuddled by Romney's responses and aggressive approach, hearing things that he did not expect. That threw off his entire game plan.</p> <p>What to do? In the context of my research, three crucial personality traits and behaviors have emerged that predict who is more or less like to falter under pressure. I suspect that President Obama's \"performer's profile\" is a middle-ground one consisting of medium to high hypnotic susceptibility, medium neuroticism and low repressive coping. These measures interact to drive perceptions and behaviors, including risk-taking behavior \u2013 such as distorting the facts, as Romney has been accused of doing. Consequently, Romney's profile is likely to be low hypnotic susceptibility, low neuroticism and high repressive coping \u2013 a profile that is associated with mental toughness in athletes, high self-esteem and confidence and obliviousness to what people think.</p> <p>While mental toughness, and high self-esteem and confidence may seem like a good thing, they also can have an insidious flip-side \u2013 namely, narcissistic as opposed to more altruistic, empathy driven motives that better serve the masses. My two identified \"ideal athlete's\" profiles, while facilitating peak performance in sports, debate performance and the seduction of voters, nevertheless must be viewed with caution. After all, voters are not opponents as in tennis matches; they are humans looking for measured and tempered leadership from leaders who do not try to seduce, but rather, inform the populace with facts and positions that are stable and constant and not expediently whipped out to win a debate.</p> <p>Now, I have never tested President Obama and candidate Romney; as such, I am speculating on the basis of their known and observed behaviors and how they correlate with the critical peak/pressure performance relevant measures that I have identified. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend assessing politicians using my \"athlete's profile\" model. It provides highly predictive insight into important subliminal psychological processes that can influence and even drive decision-making and what one will do to win an election or debate.</p> <p>My advice to President Obama: stick to the facts, elucidate your positions and when necessary defend your point of view and agenda. Unless the president is high in repressive coping, I doubt that he is capable of engaging in spin at the highest level. He would be best advised to be himself, as he is when he is on the stump \u2013 although that is easier said than done.</p> <p>Interestingly, my research suggests that there is also a dual-placebo effect, in which psychotherapists are most persuasive and believed by clients who share a similar profile. As a result, if Romney is indeed low in hypnotic susceptibility, low in neuroticism and high in repressive coping (a more rare profile), Obama can take solace in knowing there are vastly more middle-of-the-road profiles who are less likely to be influenced by behaviors and even debate presentations that are diametrically opposite to what they believe and like to see and hear.</p> <p><em>Dr Roland A Carlstedt is chairman of the American Board of Sport Psychology and author of Evidence-Based Sport Psychology (2012)</em></p>",

  "<p>That's it for another year. The calls have gone out from Stockholm and Oslo. The recipients have declared their shock and humility. And the most prestigious club in the world, the Nobel laureates, has embraced its latest members.</p> <p>The winners of this year's Nobel prizes must all be elated, including, presumably, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/12/european-union-nobel-peace-prize-joy-derision\" title=\"European Union's Nobel peace prize win greeted with joy and derision\">the entire European Union</a>.

Are there any downsides to receiving a Nobel prize?</p> <p>\"Too many to count,\" says <a href=\"http://www.condmat.physics.manchester.ac.uk/people/academic/geim/\" title=\"Andre Geim\">Andre Geim</a> at Manchester University, who with his colleague, Konstantin Novoselov, won the physics prize in 2010 for <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/\" title=\"The Nobel Prize in Physics 2010\">work on graphene</a>.

For them the negatives start even before an award is public knowledge. Thanks to the invention of time zones, those on the East coast are woken rudely in their beds before 5am. On the West coast the call comes in the dead of night, when few people answer the phone to good news.</p> <p><a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/wilczek_frank.html\" title=\"Frank Wilczek\">Frank Wilczek</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2004/\" title=\"The Nobel Prize in Physics 2004\">a physics Nobel laureate</a> at MIT, mentions several pitfalls that await the unwary winner. \"The main downsides are temptations, that can be resisted \u2013 specifically the temptation to rest on your laurels, and the dual temptation to pontificate on grandiose questions,\" he says.</p> <p>Some prize winners may let the award go to their heads, but others are almost paralysed by insecurity after being singled out for doing no more than their day job. In 2001, <a href=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerandresearch/ourcurrentresearch/researchbygrantee/dr-tim-hunt\" title=\"CRUK: Tim Hunt\">Tim Hunt at Cancer Research UK</a> shared the <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2001/\" title=\"The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2001\">Nobel prize in physiology or medicine</a> with <a href=\"http://royalsociety.org/people/paul-nurse/\" title=\"Sir Paul Nurse\">Paul Nurse</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2001/illpres/hartwell.html\" title=\"Leland Hartwell\">Leland Hartwell</a>, for discovering proteins that control cell division. \"I found it pretty hard to bear at first, and was extremely nervous that the Swedes would realise their mistake and rescind the prize at the last minute,\" Hunt says.</p> <p>Weeks after the 2001 announcement, Hunt ran into Paul Nurse, now President of the Royal Society. The encounter went something like this: \"Oh Tim,\" Nurse said. \"I've just had the most ghastly weekend \u2013 I felt so inadequate.\" Take a long look at those who have received the honour and no other response makes as much sense.</p> <p>Perhaps more unexpected is how some laureates react when deserving scientists are overlooked for the prize. As Hunt says: \"Also hard for me is the disappointment of those not chosen, but who could have been.\" The point is picked up by Wilczek. \"It can be a hard thing, emotionally, for people who think they will, or should, get it, when they don't, year after year. And also for people who have near misses, when the prizes are announced, and the winners are somebody else. This can be painful even to watch, much less experience,\" he says.</p> <p>\"Frankly, I have no complaints whatsoever,\" says <a href=\"http://www.uu.nl/university/research/en/halloffame/nobelprizewinners/Pages/martinusjgveltman.aspx?refer=/EN/research/halloffame/nobelprizewinners/martinusjgveltman\" title=\"Martin Veltman\">Martin Veltman</a>, a physics laureate at the Universities of Utrecht and Michigan.

But Veltman does raise an eyebrow at some of the other members of the Nobel club. \"Sometimes I wonder about the other laureates,\" he says. \"In fact I have discovered the truth of a remark by <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1938/fermi-bio.html\" title=\"Enrico Fermi\">[Enrico] Fermi</a>.

Like most winners, Hewish was bombarded with invitations to lecture around the globe. \"Care is required in making acceptances, and not being drawn into too many committees,\" he warns.</p> <p>Nothing much has changed since Hewish's award. <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1996/kroto-autobio.html\" title=\"Harry Kroto\">Harry Kroto</a>, who shared the chemistry prize in 1996, says he has given 80 lectures this year outside <a href=\"http://www.fsu.edu/profiles/kroto/\" title=\"FSU: Harry Kroto\">Florida State University</a>, where he is based. The talks, on subjects as varied as antiscience, the birth of natural philosophy, and science and responsibility, leave little time for much else, besides teaching, he says.</p> <p>Before the prize-winning work, Kroto hoped to devote more time to his twin passions of graphics and art, rather than representing science outside the scientific community. \"It's not what I wanted to do, I'm not even sure it's what I want to do, but it's something I feel I have to do,\" he says. \"I sometimes think I would have been happier in my studio if we hadn't made the discovery.\"</p> <p>More than anything, the Nobel prize changes people.

  "<p>New Zealand must be in a state of shock at the news that <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/sport/2012/oct/15/martin-crowe-cancer-diagnosis\" title=\"\">Martin Crowe has been diagnosed with cancer</a>, only weeks after he turned 50. It is not only that he was one of the country's finest batsmen. Crowe has retained a high profile since he was forced to retire with knee problems in his mid-30s, whether through launching Cricket Max or marrying a former Miss Universe, and he remained sufficiently fit to have launched a <a href=\"http://www.nzwomansweekly.co.nz/celebrity/celeb-stories/martin-crowes-miraculous-comeback/\" title=\"http://www.nzwomansweekly.co.nz/celebrity/celeb-stories/martin-crowes-miraculous-comeback/\">brief comeback </a>less than a year ago.</p> <p>Crowe, a cousin of the actor Russell whose elder brother Jeff was a regular New Zealand team-mate and is now an international match referee, made four Test tours of England \u2013 mostly struggling as a 20-year-old in 1983, before playing a key role in the team who made history three years later as the first Kiwis to win a Test series in England. He scored a century in the drawn first Test at Lord's, a feat he was to repeat as a 31-year-old in 1994, when his knees were already causing trouble.</p> <p>\"Not that you would have known it,\" reflected Angus Fraser, who led the England attack in that match. \"I think that was the best technical innings I've ever had played against me. Obviously I've been on the wrong end of some memorable innings \u2013 Brian Lara's 375, [Mohammad] Azharruddin's 100 off 83 balls. But in terms of the way the innings was constructed, that was pretty much perfect. Every ball was played on its merits, by a player completely in control of his game.\"</p> <p>Later on that 1994 tour Crowe scored 70 out of 151 in the first innings, and 115 in the second, to secure a draw at Old Trafford. But that was the last of his 17 Test centuries, and little more than a year later he retired.</p> <p>He left especially vivid memories of his batting in Somerset. He first joined them as a 21-year-old for the 1984 season, having toured England the previous year and spent time in the Bradford League and on the MCC groundstaff at Lord's before that. He was so successful in that first year in Taunton that he was named one of Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year for 1985, with Larry Gomes, Geoff Humpage, Jack Simmons and Sidath Wettimuny.</p> <p>Yet as the essay that appeared in that year's <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154457.html\" title=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154457.html\">Wisden reflected</a>, it had not all been plain sailing. \"At the age of 21, Martin David Crowe, who was born in Auckland, New Zealand, on September 22, 1962, achieved in his first season of county cricket what most cricketers would have considered impossible.</p> <p>\"In terms of cricket, the esteem of colleagues and public respect, he managed to fill, with poise and dignity, the enormous gap left in Somerset's ranks by the absence of Vivian Richards, who was touring with the West Indians. In any context this was a remarkable achievement. Set against the background of a broken thumb and food poisoning, suffered on the New Zealand tour of Sri Lanka, the anxiety to do well in a strange environment, homesickness and a most depressing first month, it was astonishing.\"</p> <p>Crowe suffered five consecutive single-figure failures in the last week in May, and has since admitted to going home to cry. (He has also suggested that having Ian Botham as his first housemate did not help his diet). But he bounced back in June to score 719 runs at an average of 143.8, and ended with 2,600 runs in all competitions.</p> <p>He recalled an especially torrid clash with Andy Roberts, the ferocious West Indies fast bowler who was guesting with Leicestershire, as \"the gutsiest innings I played\" \u2013 although he went on to score a famous century against West Indies in Wellington as New Zealand held the then kings of world cricket at home.</p> <p>The Wisden essay also recounts Crowe's off-field contribution. \"Perceptively observing that some of the younger players needed more purpose and pride in their jobs, he formed the Young Nags Club (uncapped players only, wearing ties and jackets; capped players by invitation). It was a great success. They met regularly at the Nag's Head, a pub near Taunton, to discuss problems, have a meal, levy fines for misconduct on and off the field, and enjoy themselves in a purposeful way.\"</p> <p>He returned in trickier circumstances in 1987 following the departures of Botham, Richards and Joel Garner, but again contributed handsomely with the bat before his back seized up driving south from Old Trafford after a game against Lancashire the following summer. It turned out he had stress fractures of the spine \u2013 he was replaced at Somerset by a young Australian called Steve Waugh.</p> <p>But Crowe recovered from those back troubles, returned to Test cricket and ended with 5,444 runs at a <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/36622.html\" title=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/36622.html\">very healthy average</a> of 45.36 that he has stressed would and should have been more had he not been rushed into the team too soon, and played on a little too long on one leg. Now it is his more serious health concerns that have shocked New Zealand, and cricket.</p>",
  "<p>Narratives matter. They help us to frame a concept, to personalise a debate, to prevent academia from getting lost in the clouds of theory. However, a narrative alone cannot be an argument for or against a larger position. A narrative can be used to frame a problem, but cannot be used to solve it.</p> <p>This is probably the largest of the many errors Mehdi Hasan makes in his Huffington Post UK piece, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/mehdi-hasan/being-prolife-doesnt-make_b_1964683.html\" title=\"\">Being pro-life doesn't make me any less of a lefty</a>. To be fair, Hasan doesn't lead with his narrative, but he does make it clear, once we reach that point in the article, that his personal experience informs his entire worldview on the choice of abortion. He says:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I would be opposed to abortion even if I were to lose my faith. I sat and watched in quiet awe as my two daughters stretched and slept in their mother's womb during the 20-week ultrasound scans. I don't need God or a holy book to tell me what is or isn't a 'person'.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>While this is all well and good, a counter-narrative could easily be presented:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I watched in quiet horror as the ultrasound flickered, showing the still-indistinct at 14-week mass focusing in and out on the screen. That mass of splitting and differentiating cells would tie me to my abuser forever. I would never, ever get away. This was it; this was the final leash. He had won. This was my life, forever. I had to get away. I had to abort.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Of course a father looking at the ultrasound image of his gestating, 20-week-old daughters is going to feel love and awe and the majesty of life, and deeply feel that those are his babies and that they are people. Because \u2013 and this is what Hasan is fundamentally missing in his entire piece \u2013 those babies were <em>wanted</em>.</p> <p>Hasan says he wishes to make three points to \"his friends on the pro-choice left\". The first point he wants to make is that the UK is the exception rather than the rule when it comes to abortion access. He asserts that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/06/jeremy-hunt-12-week-abortion-limit\" title=\"\">Jeremy Hunt's position</a>, that 12 weeks' gestation should be the cut-off for legal abortion, is normal across western Europe, and that France, Germany, Italy and Belgium all adhere to this limit.</p> <p>Well, I admit that as an American, I do not know the abortion rules for EU countries off the top of my head. But as a pedant, I do know that Google exists. And less than five minutes with Google told me this:</p> <p><strong>France:</strong> Abortion <a href=\"http://riviera.angloinfo.com/information/healthcare/pregnancy-birth/termination-abortion/\" title=\"\">on demand is legal</a> up to 12 weeks (14 weeks last menstrual period). After this, France reverts to something akin to what the UK has by default: <a href=\"http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072665&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006687544&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=cid\" title=\"\">two physicians must attest to the need for abortion</a> due to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman, the woman's life is in danger, or the foetus has deformities that are incompatible with life.</p> <p><strong>Germany:</strong> Much like France, in Germany abortion is legal and available largely on demand for the first trimester. After this point, the very broadly defined \"<a href=\"http://www.buzer.de/s1.htm?g=StGB&amp;a=218-219b\" title=\"\">medical necessity</a>\" may be invoked.</p> <p><strong>Belgium:</strong> As far as I can piece together from Anglophile websites and translated pages, Belgium allows <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/30/world/belgium-eases-its-abortion-law.html?pagewanted=1\" title=\"\">abortion without stringent prohibitions</a> until the 12th week, and \u2013 say it with me \u2013 in case of medical emergency or duress after that point.</p> <p><strong>Italy:</strong> While you might assume Italy would have the most restrictive laws, it allows abortion for the first 90 days of pregnancy, which is a bit closer to abortion until the 13th week. However, like everyone else, it merely takes a doctor's confirmation of <a href=\"http://www.iub.edu/~kinsey/ccies/it.php#contracep\" title=\"\">severe injury to a woman's physical or mental health</a>, or serious birth defects incompatible with life, in order to access an abortion after this cut-off point.</p> <p>So, in other words, Hasan either does not understand the laws in the countries that he cites, or he is obfuscating in the hope that no one will notice.</p> <p>Putting aside his factual inaccuracy, let's address what it would mean to restrict abortion to 12 weeks. In the UK, 91% of abortions procured were at or before 12 weeks; 78% are at or before 10 weeks. For the other 9%, the numbers do what you would expect, and continue to dramatically drop between the 14th and 16th week, and then again between the 16th and 19th week. Approximately 1% of abortions \u2013 around 2,729 \u2013 are done at or after the 20th week; numbers that <a href=\"https://www.wp.dh.gov.uk/transparency/files/2012/05/Commentary1.pdf\" title=\"\">happen to correspond pretty closely</a> to how many abortions are granted due to there being abnormalities with the foetus that are largely considered incompatible with life.</p> <p>As to why there is a delay in seeking abortion from that remaining 9%, the statistics do not give a reason. However, we can easily extrapolate that for about the majority of that group, the foetal abnormalities that led them to choose abortion were not detectable until closer to the 16th week of gestation (if not later), as that's approximately when testing results are accurate and available. For the remainder, we can draw upon a range of conclusions \u2013 access to services, delay due to outside forces, inability to decide and so forth \u2013 but the question ultimately remains as to whether or not any of that is relevant, when the option is either forced pregnancy and illegal abortion, or legal and safe abortion. Ultimately, whether you are a \"lefty\" (or otherwise a social progressive), you must agree to some basic concepts, including the preservation of the rights to life, liberty and the responsible exercise of moral agency.</p> <p>These rights are undermined when women are denied the freedom to decide whether and when to have children, and how many of them to have. Reproductive freedom is an essential part of women's right to liberty. It is vital to both liberty and responsible moral agency that we be free to protect our health, to plan and shape our lives. So vital is this social good that wherever safe, legal and affordable abortion is unavailable, many women risk death, permanent physical injury, social disgrace and legal prosecution to end unwanted pregnancies.</p> <p>I realise that Hasan attempts to block this argument by arguing that the \"unborn child\" is weaker and more vulnerable, and thus more deserving of protection, but this assumes that a foetus has full moral status equal to that of the woman who is pregnant. At this point, I merely refer you to Mary Anne Warren's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Moral-Status-Obligations-Persons-Biomedical/dp/0198250401/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350258107&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=mary+anne+warren+moral\" title=\"\">chapter on Abortion and Human Rights in Moral Status: Obligations to Persons and Other Living Things</a>, wherein she clearly explains the biological and moral justifications to not grant sentience, and therefore equal moral status, to first- and early second-trimester foetuses.</p> <p>From this inaccurate argument, Hasan moves on to another one: the history of women's rights activists and an apparent argument that early feminists were anti-choice and \u2026 well, I'm not entirely sure what his argument is, other than to note this historical fact and then deviate into modern anti-choice feminism:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Then there is the history you gloss over: some of the earliest advocates of women's rights, such Mary Wollstonecraft, were anti-abortion, as were pioneers of US feminism such as Susan B Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton; the latter referred to abortion as \"infanticide\". In recent years, some feminists have recognised the sheer injustice of asking a woman to abort her child in order to participate fully in society; in the words of the New Zealand feminist author Daphne de Jong: \"If women must submit to abortion to preserve their lifestyle or career, their economic or social status, they are pandering to a system devised and run by men for male convenience.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>There are two separate issues here. First, history. Yes, Anthony and Stanton were anti-abortion. Historical women's rights activists were not always awesome. For example, Anthony and Stanton were also quite racist by contemporary standards. Anthony was so upset with the idea of freedmen getting the vote before women that she frequently argued that educated white women would make better voters than ignorant black and immigrant men. She also wasn't above using racist fears to further her goals; after the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\" title=\"\">15th Amendment to the US constitution</a> gave freedmen the right to vote, she argued that voting freedmen threatened the safety of white women (playing up fears of \"racial contamination\").</p> <p>Are we then to assume that Hasan thinks contemporary feminists should back the racist positions held by Anthony? One presumes not, as this would undoubtedly negatively effect him. Why, then, should we selectively be required to follow other outdated ideas? It's not glossing over history to be grateful for advocates who set the stage for our rights while simultaneously discarding the culturally constructed beliefs that we now view as morally wrong.</p> <p>The second issue is contemporary anti-choice feminists like de Jong. Yes, many contemporary women are anti-choice, in part because they focus on the social avenues that influence women to abort: it is a problem that a woman feels the need to abort a wanted pregnancy to preserve lifestyle, career, economic or social status. This is \"pandering to a system devised and run by men for male convenience\". The solution to this, however, is not banning abortion and instituting forced pregnancy. The solution is to change the circumstances \u2013 the social determinants \u2013 that leave a woman deciding a wanted pregnancy should be terminated.</p> <p>But note the emphasis there: <em>wanted</em>. While changing the social status quo may change the mind of some unintentionally pregnant women, removing choice also functions to reinforce male convenience and control. As Warren notes, abortion is controversial now because it is a \"symbol of contemporary cultural and political struggles over sexual morality and the social roles of women\". Those who are anti-choice typically tend to follow more conservative beliefs about the physiological differences between men and women, tend to oppose sex education in schools and resist easy access to contraceptives. And perhaps most to the point, this is done because abortion is seen as a threat to the role of women in the family \"because it frees them to engage in heterosexual intercourse without the risk of unwanted motherhood\". Or, as the feminist blog <a href=\"http://jezebel.com/\" title=\"\">Jezebel</a> frequently notes, this viewpoint considers unintended/unwanted pregnancy a punishment for women having \"unsanctioned\" sex; that is, sex for fun, outside marriage, and without the intent to procreate.</p> <p>We can only extrapolate, from historical documents, what founding suffragettes may or may not have believed about contemporary access to abortion. We do know that abortion prior to Roe v Wade in the US was an often nasty and horrible process that threatened, and took, the lives of women; it is difficult to believe that the explicit danger to a woman from an abortion in the 1800s didn't influence the anti-abortion position of Anthony, Stanton and others. We don't need to go back to Stanton's time to know how dangerous abortion was, either \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.tbtam.com/2006/02/doing-the-work-that-has-to-be-done.html\" title=\"\">we don't even have to go back to the 1960s</a>. All we have to do is look at countries today where abortion is illegal. In 2008, complications from unsafe abortion <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_IAW.html\" title=\"\">accounted</a> for an estimated 13% of all maternal deaths worldwide.</p> <p>Hasan would like his rights to his belief respected and perhaps understood, rather than being demonised as a misogynist or dismissed as a man who has no right to an opinion on this topic. What Hasan is missing is that no one is saying he has to be pro-choice. He can be anti-choice. But that is much different than attempting to make a choice for others.</p> <p>Joe Biden, of all people, eloquently stated this Thursday night during the American vice-presidential debate, <a href=\"http://blogs.christianpost.com/cp-events/transcript-biden-and-ryan-on-abortion-and-closing-statements-12467/\" title=\"\">when he said</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I've been a practising Catholic my whole life. With regard to abortion, I accept my church's position on abortion. I accept it in my personal life. But I refuse to impose it on equally devout Christians and Muslims and Jews. I do not believe that we have a right to tell women they can't control their body. It's a decision between them and their doctor.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Hasan argues, at the end of his article, that the biggest problem with the abortion debate is that it is asymmetrical, \"the two sides are talking at cross-purposes\". But the biggest problem with the abortion debate is not that it is asymmetric \u2013 it is that one group, the anti-choice group, is attempting to force their views on everyone else. As a pro-choice woman, I am not interested in whether or not another woman is carrying a pregnancy to term or aborting, save in the case where the woman asks for my opinion or involvement. My pro-choice position is not pushing her to abort \u2013 not even if, in my opinion, it would be the best thing for her life. As I do not believe in forced pregnancy, I do not believe in forced abortion.</p> <p>I believe in choice.</p> <p>\u2022 A version of this piece <a href=\"http://www.kellyhills.com/blog/lies-damned-lies-and-mehdi-hasan-on-abortion/\" title=\"\">first appeared on the author's blog</a>.</p>",

  "<p>Lawyers intimidate. That is not criticism: it is after all what we pay them to do. Even with the most consensual divorce, or a conveyancing transaction, we know there is another person involved whose interests differ from ours and we need to be reassured that, if we end up in battle, our weapon will be scarier than theirs. The power to intimidate, in most cases carefully disguised, is a key part of a lawyer's armoury.</p> <p>But from a customer point of view, that veiled sense of power, however useful, carries the threat that it could be turned against us. And, as a recent piece of <a href=\"http://www.legalombudsman.org.uk/aboutus/Research_and_survey_findings.html\" title=\"\">YouGov research</a> commissioned by the <a href=\"http://www.legalombudsman.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Legal Ombudsman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.legalservicesconsumerpanel.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Legal Services Board Consumer Panel shows</a>, that threat is one of the central reasons why lawyers have been so slow to adapt their practice to modern customer demands.</p> <p>The sense of powerlessness and - yes - fear, which lawyers engender in their clients, means that they choke off a key element of customer feedback: complaints.</p> <p>Complaints has been a vexed and unhappy question in the legal profession for years. The palpable failure to command consumer confidence on the part of successive complaints organisations run by the Law Society resulted in parliament using the Legal Services Act to set up the Legal Ombudsman, an independent, statutory complaints scheme, which opened for business in October 2010. Critically, the scheme put an end to the unedifying spectacle of lawyers judging complaints about lawyers.</p> <p>The statutory powers given to the Ombudsman - the ability to command co-operation of lawyers and remedies including compensation of up \u00a330,000 \u2013 have proved key to avoiding the sorts of impasses which bedevilled the previous arrangements. But whereas in other areas of professional life the introduction of a genuinely independent Ombudsman scheme led to a significant rise in the number of customers complaining, there was no such increase with lawyers. While over 73,000 complaints received in just under two years is not a shabby figure, it is nothing beside the million or more complaints handled every year about the financial services sector.</p> <p>Partly, it's the economy, stupid. As the housing market has collapsed, so has the conveyancing market, previously by some margin the most common cause of complaints. The cuts to legal aid which are now beginning to bite and the simple reduction in the available cash to pay for divorce and family law also depress legal transactions and therefore complaints.</p> <p>However, the YouGov research showed that the biggest brake on complaints was customer fear. In some cases, that was merely fear of looking a fool. Law is a mysterious business with its own language and traditions, not easily accessible to the layperson (as a lay Ombudsman I am very much aware of that), but many complainants feared that the response from the lawyer would be less than helpful and indeed, we have had many instances where lawyers have responded to complaints by dropping the case in midstream, or threatening legal action against their client. We have even had lawyers charging clients for the privilege of responding to complaints about overcharging.</p> <p>What lawyers need to remember is that good complaints handling is good for business. In law, it remains the case that most clients come via personal recommendation and keeping customers happy is essential to future income. Over the next few months, we'll be working with regulators in the industry, such as the Legal Services Board and the Solicitors Regulation Authority, to help them address issues around complaint handling, but we also need to look at what we have learned from the research.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.legalombudsman.org.uk/aboutus/Research_and_survey_findings.html\" title=\"\">YouGov report</a> points up the need for us to be clearer about what we do and build awareness of our existence. For an Ombudsman scheme, this is a difficult issue. The legal profession pays for our scheme and would doubtless take a dim view of us advertising for business, but we've been reviewing our website to make it more accessible, canvassing the views of under-represented minority groups to see what more can be done to reach them, and talking to our fellow Ombudsmen about what can be done to build understanding of what an Ombudsman is and does. We have also updated our <a href=\"http://www.legalombudsman.org.uk/aboutus/publications.html\" title=\"\">guides for making complaints and good complaints handling.</a></p> <p>Ultimately, however, the obligation is on lawyers to deal with complaints properly themselves and to signpost customers to us if they can't resolve the issue. With big brands poised to enter the legal market, now is not the time for lawyers to retrench into old behaviours. The likes of the Co-op, Saga and the AA did not grow to their current size by ignoring the views of their customers. Law is a service industry and, ultimately, the customer will decide.</p>",
  "<p>To describe Britain's attitude to food security over the past couple of decades as cavalier is a serious understatement it. In the grand new globalised world you didn't have to grow apples because you could ship them from New Zealand or South Africa. You didn't have to worry about peas or beans , they came from Peru or Kenya. Chicken from Thailand; fish from wherever the latest ocean-hoovering operation was destroying future stocks \u2013 no cause for alarm there. All you needed was a fistful of pounds, and the food would be there to be bought.</p> <p>There had been the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution\" title=\"\">green revolution</a> from the late 1960s that had saved the world from starvation. If supplies ran short, we'd just have to crank up the technology again and all would be well. Food was cheap for Western consumers, and it was assumed that it would keep getting cheaper.</p> <p>In fact, we never actually were in any kind of global food utopia \u2013 even at the best point around 1995 there were nearly 800 million people going regularly hungry in the world, and obesity from inappropriate nutrition, closely linked to the rise of high-fructose corn syrup, trans fats and fizzy drinks, has just kept growing and spreading. And it's become increasingly obvious that agriculture based on petroleum inputs \u2013 for cultivation, spraying and harvest; for fertiliser; for global distribution \u2013 is going to have to change, fast.</p> <p>But mostly that's been regarded in the UK as an unfortunate global problem, something for the Department for International Development to worry about \u2013 and sometimes as almost a positive, as one of the driving factors of the Arab Spring.</p> <p>Yet last week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/10/food-prices-rise-wettest-summer\" title=\"\"> with British wheat yields being reduced by 14.1% on the five-year average</a>, and the latest global food prices <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/161602/icode/\" title=\"\"> going up by 1.4% in September</a>, the issue has again pushed to centre stage, and close to home.</p> <p>Britain is slowly waking up to the fact that relying on the rest of the world for large amounts of foods we could easily grow ourselves might not be a great idea. Food prices <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/statistics/files/defra-stats-foodfarm-food-pocketbook-2012-121005.pdf\" title=\"\">rose 32% (12% in real terms) in the UK between 2007 and 2012</a> while increasing only 13% in France and Germany. The price of fruit has been particularly hard hit.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, with real incomes squeezed, consumption of this key nutritional item has fallen, at the greatest rate among lowest income households. They're already spending around 17% of their income on food With many also in fuel poverty, they're going to struggle to find the extra money that they'll need.</p> <p>Only 23% of our fruit and vegetables come from the UK - or 10% when you just count fruit \u2013 and those imports are only going to get more expensive. That's if they are available at all.</p> <p>It wasn't so long ago that every British city and town was surrounded by market gardens, orchards and dairies. And that's where we need to be \u2013 and can be - again.</p> <p>We need a stable, secure food supply, with a short distance from field to plate. We need to work to increase consumption of fruit and vegetables, and cut reduce consumption of meat from livestock few on grain. And we need a decentralised distribution system that's not reliant on a few giant warehouses. That is, not built around a handful of giant, monopolistic supermarkets.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/nine-meals-anarchy\" title=\"\">New Economics Foundation concluded in 2008</a>, we're currently operating a system that's only nine meals from anarchy (PDF). We've got a just-in-time food delivery system, which I saw firsthand when my local Green party in Camden had a pop-up shop during the London election campaign. At least three times a day, an HGV would draw up outside the local supermarket, offloading food that went straight on to the shelves - then straight out the door.</p> <p>Ensuring its people can eat is one of the most basic responsibilities of government. It's time, in its approach to competition law, to planning law, to flood protection, to planning for the future, that our government started to take this fundamental responsibility seriously.</p> <p>If food prices rise sharply, as they're highly likely to do \u2013 fruit, vegetables, and the real basics like bread and butter \u2013 it's the poorest who'll suffer first and worst.</p> <p>But if food supplies become tight, and post-peak oil fuel costs soar, then the impact on Britain's food supply will be felt by everyone. And the government will have to wonder why, in 2012, it was not taking seriously the need to produce food in Britain, close to where it would be eaten.</p>",
  "<p>When we first meet Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) in Robert Zemeckis's Flight, he is pulling himself from the wreckage of a hotel room decorated with minibar bottles, cigarette butts and the underwear of the flight attendant lying next to him.</p> <p>This being a work day, Whip perks himself up with a line of cocaine, dons his captain's uniform, strolls down the walkway and straps himself into the cockpit of the passenger jet he is flying out of Orlando, bound for Atlanta. Things get a little bumpy along the way: his tailplane snaps, sending the plane into a nosedive, but Whip, by the same law that allows drunken sailors to walk in straight line on a keeling ship, manages to crashland the plane, losing only six lives in the process. He flies upside down for part of the journey, but still. This is Denzel Washington we're talking here. Guy could find his centre of gravity in a black hole.</p> <p>The landing itself is as rivet-loosening as you might expect of the director who put us through a similar nosedive in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/87219/cast.away\" title=\"\">Cast Away</a>. I knew Zemeckis had outdone himself when I saw, in a touching moment of sympathy for the cabin attendant, an entire row of heads in front of me leaning hard left. Having flayed our nerves, the director then sets us down for \u2013 well, for what exactly? As a toxicology report came to light with blood-alcohol counts that would put down a buffalo, I readied myself for a courtroom drama, complete with hammered gavels and surprise character-witnesses. But the airline kills the toxicology report easily enough, and Whip holes up in a dilapidated farmhouse with a stack of bourbon bottles: ah, an alcoholism case study and one man's battle to tell the truth. Then the TV crews start crowding Whip's lawn, at which point I finally put a tick next to \"Gumpian demystification of the American hero in the age of cable news\".</p> <p>The film is a little of all of the above, which perhaps explains its 140-minute running time. I could have done with the Christianists and crazies, with their god-talk and chatter about the machinations of fate \u2013 a favourite Zemeckis theme, although he made the same point much better with a DeLorean in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/78042/back-to-the-future\" title=\"\">Back to the Future</a>. His early films were cackling entertainments that moved too fast for you to notice the blackness of their humour \u2013 like a hi-tech Preston Sturges. That's what made <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/54595/forrest.gump\" title=\"\">Forrest Gump</a> so hard to bear: half of that movie was a comic-absurdist take on American history as retold by an idiot not too far from Kurt Vonnegut's heart. But then Zemeckis fell in love with his idiot, swept the Oscars and that was that.</p> <p>After a decade spent tooling around with cold marvels such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/104060/polar.express\" title=\"\">The Polar Express</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/132455/christmas-carol\" title=\"\">A Christmas Carol</a>, Zemeckis's return to life-action film-making is being hailed as The Kind of Adult Drama They Don't Make Anymore. Flight is more entertaining and more cunning than that, its black humour buoyed by punchy Rolling Stones tracks and an ebullient cameo from John Goodman. Next to Gump, the film has the moral force of a George Steiner essay, but what lends it that force are not the carefully calibrated moral ambiguities of the script, but the bruised, defiant soul that appears to us in the form of Denzel Washington.</p> <p>He's barely off-screen. Flight is a star vehicle, rolled and inverted just like that plane \u2013 but then Washington is probably the only star of his stature capable of flipping our expectations on their back without a wink to reassure us that it's really him. This is probably his meatiest role since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/89684/training.day\" title=\"\">Training Day</a> and he bites down deep. From Whip's cool amid the chaos of that cockpit to his darting glance when the word \"toxicology\" first comes up, Washington gives us all this man's cocksureness, his selfishness, belligerence and flashes of panic, safe in the knowledge that he has only to walk down a corridor using that patented Washington roll \u2013 as if he runs on lubricated ball bearings \u2013 and we will be with him, every step of the way.</p>",

  "<p>Hundreds of olive trees have been uprooted, burned or cut down by extremist settlers since the annual harvest got under way in the West Bank this month, prompting calls for the Israeli authorities to protect Palestinian farmers and their property.</p> <p>According to the United Nations, more than 870 trees were vandalised in the first week of the harvest, which began in most places on or after 5 October. A coalition of four Israeli human rights organisations said more than 450 trees had been damaged over the past week.</p> <p>The damage is usually discovered when Palestinian families arrive at their groves to gather the fruit. Sometimes Palestinians are attacked during the harvest itself.</p> <p>Settler attacks on olive groves have increased over recent years. Since the beginning of this year, a total of 7,180 Palestinian-owned trees have been vandalised by settlers, according to the UN's office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs. Last year about 10,000 trees were uprooted or vandalised.</p> <p>Robert Serry, the UN's special co-ordinator for the Middle East peace process, said the damage and destruction of trees was reprehensible. \"Israel must live up to its commitments under international law to protect Palestinians and their property in the occupied territory so that the olive harvest \u2013 a crucial component of Palestinian livelihoods and the Palestinian economy \u2013 can proceed unhindered,\" he said.</p> <p>Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation's executive committee, said settlers were launching attacks under the protection of the Israeli military.</p> <p>In a letter to diplomats, she appealed to international missions to send observers to at-risk olive-picking areas to monitor abuses by settlers and soldiers.</p> <p>\"In the past month alone, Israeli settlers uprooted 300 trees in al-Mughir and Turmusaya villages, cut down 120 trees in Nablus, destroyed 100 olive saplings and 60 vine trees in al-Khader village, uprooted 40 trees in Ras Karkar, and assaulted and hospitalised three Palestinian farmer and injured one other,\" she wrote. According to Oxfam, there are about 9.5m olive trees in the West Bank.</p> <p>On a visit to the West Bank village of Aboud on Monday, Waleed Assaf, the Palestinian agriculture minister, said the proportion of GDP earned from agriculture had fallen from 28% to 5.6% over the past 20 years. This decline, he said, was mainly due to the confiscation of land for Israeli settlements, bypass roads and the security barrier, as well as the difficulties faced by Palestinian farmers in accessing their land. Serious water shortages were also hampering agricultural output, he said.</p> <p>\"We have lost half a million trees,\" Assaf said. \"We are planting more but it takes 10 years for a young olive tree to start producing fruit.\"</p> <p>On the edge of the village, Eid Khalil, 41, was harvesting his fruit. He said Aboud had lost 18 dunams (4.5 acres) of olive trees when land was confiscated to build the nearby settlement of Bet Arye. \"It used to take until Christmas to pick the village olives. Now it takes a month,\" he said.</p> <p>Aboud's population of 2,200 is evenly divided between Muslims and Christians. \"The majority of people work in agriculture,\" said the Greek Orthodox parish priest Emmanuel Awwad. \"The oil is the only income for most of the families.\"</p>",

The legend tells of four children turned into swans in the days when Ireland was inhabited by a prehistoric people known as the Tuatha De Danaan.

  "<p>An <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/15/google-privacy-policy?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">imminent report</a> on an emerging threat to individual privacy to be issued by the European data protection authorities raises even more serious issues than those it is likely to address. The report will consider Google's asserted right to expand its data mining to combine users' personal data across all their accounts and services, including Gmail, internet searching, map and location information and photo sharing, with no way for individuals to opt out. At least <a href=\"http://marketingland.com/microsoft-privacy-change-google-attacked-23598\" title=\"\">one technology blogger has accused Microsoft of planning similar changes</a>, while two <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/facebook-advertising-features-bring-privacy-forefront/story?id=17386543#.UHwQtLQ45UQ\" title=\"\">new Facebook programmes</a> to aggregate user data with other advertising and loyalty card data have also drawn concern. Whatever the merits of each case, the larger issue deserves greater public attention.</p> <p>There is a powerful reason why cloud services and other data-mining companies aggregate data across multiple accounts and services: the results are extremely valuable. Just as tiny bits of coloured tile can be combined and transformed into a coherent piece of art, tiny bits of seemingly unrelated personal data, when aggregated and mined at huge scale, can provide immense value to advertisers, marketers, corporate sales forces and others. The revenue generated by combining and monetising such data \u2013 by mining the mosaic \u2013 is the reason \"free\" cloud services can afford to be free.</p> <p>Privacy groups and regulators are appropriately concerned with threats to individual privacy inherent in mosaic-mining business models. Less noticed has been the potential use of these same tools and techniques against government employees and, potentially, governments themselves. But is this a more serious problem and, if so, why? The privacy rights of government employees are no more or less important than those of private citizens. Beyond individual privacy, however, consider the national security, government integrity, and even personal safety implications.</p> <p>What if, instead of using the power of mosaic mining to identify a potential new customer, it was used to identify an undercover intelligence operative? Multiple map queries starting at a known intelligence agency's headquarters instead of the work address on an operative's business card, might suggest their true job, even if those queries were conducted from their personal computer. Such a scenario is neither hypothetical nor attractive just to adversarial intelligence services. American lawyers defending Guant\u00e1namo inmates <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/21/us/21gitmo.html\" title=\"\">provided surreptitiously obtained photographs of undercover CIA operatives</a> to their clients. Whatever the lawyers' motives, imagine how much more could be done by those motivated to out covert agents, if they mined today's mosaic of private and governmental information.</p> <p>What if, instead of mining the mosaic to anticipate a company's office supply needs, data from across individual and government accounts \u2013 email contents, internet searches, travel plans \u2013 were used to anticipate a government policy decision or treaty negotiating position? What might the geolocation of a cop's personal laptop for several consecutive nights reveal about a stakeout? And what pressure could be put on government decision-makers by someone armed with video download receipts, browser search records or credit card statements?</p> <p>These risks do not assume ill motives on the part of cloud service providers, although we must assume that there are at least a few such companies around the globe not particularly diligent about selling amalgamated customer data. But no company can hope to block all ill-motivated insiders or skilled hackers. Massive databases of aggregated personal and governmental data would present irresistible targets.</p> <p>Beyond such security concerns, what European data protection authorities are confronting is an early, but vital, test of whether governments will continue to control their own data.</p> <p>Governments considering deployment of cloud computing solutions should consider several steps to mitigate these risks. The first step is awareness. Law enforcement, security and other governmental organisations should consider carefully the ramifications of a private entity being able to aggregate sensitive data across government, and their employees', private accounts. Second, governmental entities should not accept generic provider privacy policies, but should demand government-specific agreements prohibiting data mining.</p> <p>Governments also should insist that data-mining capabilities be technologically disabled from use against their data. Providers whose business models are so dependent on data mining that they cannot compete for government business without it may have to stick to the many lucrative non-governmental markets. Beyond this, governments should ensure they can determine independently whether vendors are living up to no-data-mining assurances. Finally, governments should provide their employees with awareness training about the risks of data mining of their personal and governmental accounts \u2013 a prudent measure whether or not cloud solutions are deployed.</p> <p>Personal privacy is vitally important. But if governments do not address the national security implications of mining the mosaic, we may soon look back with nostalgia to when personal privacy was our only concern.</p>",

If oblivion is your version of nirvana, they will be ideal. That's pretty much all we know about the duo behind the name: that they're into making music that should prove the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Perfect-Prescription-Spacemen-3/dp/B000067A6K\" title=\"\">perfect prescription</a> if you're feeling wound up and fancy a little <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOL1291ryKM\" title=\"\">floating in space</a>. Time will tell whether the pair \u2013 Tony Harewood and Joseph Marshall, both in their mid-20s \u2013 will have a relationship as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/apr/12/jason-pierce-my-liver-was-gone\" title=\"\">fraught and fractious as the one between Pete Kember and Jason Pierce</a>. For now, their year-long partnership has been mellow and fruitful, bearing one EP, Chronic Youth, released to a muted fanfare last year, and a new single, Endless Wave/Blue Flower, which comes out next month. So far there are no signs of the sort of acrimony that has kept their space-rock forebears apart for almost a quarter of a century. So far, this Paradise has not been lost.</p> <p>Basically, if you like organ-fuelled, quasi-spiritual gospel-rock, you'll love what Paradise have done on Endless Wave/Blue Flower, the latest word in ecstatic, ethereal indie. If you don't, you'll consider the songs a couple of dreary dirges. Blue Flower is actually a cover of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhIq5uk2hW8\" title=\"\">the Mazzy Star song</a>, which confirms an interesting link between country rock and space rock, between the down-home and the out-of-this-world. Maybe it's a drug thing: this kind of smacked-out balladry has been a mainstay of rock's repertoire since the Velvets and the Stones. There is something distinctly druggy about the delivery of the track, with its Huxleyan allusions to doors of perception (\"Your eyes were windows to another world\") and apocalyptic visions (\"This is the end\"). It's a bit pat, a bit studied, a feeling heightened by the arrival of the Big Gospel Finale (although kudos to Paradise for managing to secure a choir to achieve it).</p> <p>Endless Wave is faster, equal parts surf-pop and space-rock, like the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/beach-boys\" title=\"\">Beach Boys</a> produced by Sonic Boom. Again, credit to the pair for trying, in this case locating the spiritual essence at the heart of surf. But really Brian Wilson \u2013 and Gary Usher \u2013 beat them to it 50 years ago, when they wrote <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n7haH_aFEA\" title=\"\">Lonely Sea</a>, 150 seconds of epochal, hymnal bliss.

  "<p>Under the jagged Andean peaks of south-west Colombia, a group of villagers gathered on a cloudy morning at the rural school, where they mixed cement to rebuild a classroom destroyed in March by a mortar shell.</p> <p>The mortar had been fired by guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), aimed at an army outpost on the next hill. But, like many of the homemade explosives used by the rebels, it missed its mark.</p> <p>This time, the villagers were lucky; there were no casualties. But after living under the shadow of leftist guerrilla groups for nearly 50 years, townspeople know that death can come from either side and at any time. \"If you're home, you hide under the bed,\" says Jos\u00e9 Aurelio Medina, a community leader in Calandaima. \"If you're in the fields, you take cover anywhere. You wait for the fighting to stop.\"</p> <p>There is a chance now that the fighting could stop permanently, across Colombia. Peace talks between the Farc and the government of President Juan Manuel Santos begin this week in Oslo, Norway, and will then continue in Havana, Cuba, in what analysts say is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/13/fidel-castro-hugo-chavez-colombia-farc-talks?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">the most serious effort yet to end one of the world's longest-running civil wars</a>.</p> <p>Though the Farc is militarily weakened and government forces have the upper hand, each seems to have reached the conclusion that a battlefield victory is impossible.</p> <p>Unlike previous peace talks, in which the two sides tried to address all that is wrong in Colombia, the talks are focused simply on ending the conflict. The agenda includes just five items: rural development, political participation, the end of armed conflict, drug trafficking, and the rights of the victims of the conflict.</p> <h2><strong>Demobilisation</strong><br></h2> <p>\"The fact that not all the problems of Colombia are being addressed at the table is positive,\" says Kristian Herbolzheimer, a conflict resolution expert with Conciliation Resources, a non-governmental organisation in London. If successful, the talks will end in the demobilisation of the Farc's 9,000 or so fighters and a period of peace-building will begin.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/latin-america-caribbean/andes/colombia/045-colombia-peace-at-last.aspx\" title=\"\">recent report</a>, the International Crisis Group, another NGO, said talks would \"ultimately need to lead into a wider social process aimed at tackling the problems affecting the countryside that provide the backdrop for the conflict\".</p> <p>Monica Villota, the sociologist who runs Esfera Azul, an NGO dedicated to community organising in Cauca, lives in that backdrop, agrees: \"It's a complex conflict and the solution to the conflict will also need to be complex.\"</p> <p>The conflict plays out not just in the exchange of gunfire but in the day-to-day lives of the population. In areas such as Cauca, where the Farc are strong, people either submit to the local commander's often arbitrary rule, offering up pigs, a day's labour or even their sons and daughters when required, or they leave the area.</p> <p>Victor Salas, a municipal official in the town of Corinto who deals with complaints about rights abuses, says he very rarely gets a complaint about rebel abuses even though the Farc dominate the mountains above the town and often mount attacks in its streets. \"Around here, you have to know how to live,\" he says. \"If you want to stay, you keep your head down.\"</p> <p>Like the other illegal factions in the war, the Farc are largely fuelled by drug money, Colombia being still the world's largest source of cocaine. But the war is rooted in centuries-old struggles for control over land and rich mineral resources, and in the fact that Colombia has one of the most unequal distributions of wealth in the world.</p> <p>Redistribution has been left off the current agenda, as has the thorny issue of whether rebels should be made to pay for abuses they have committed: a string of crimes against humanity including rape, kidnapping, massacres and forced displacement.</p> <p>According to one recent survey, 77% of Colombians support the peace process, but 78% want to see the Farc made to pay for their crimes. That sends a complicated message to negotiators in Norway and Cuba.</p> <p>The agenda mentions the victims of the conflict and the need for truth, but pointedly leaves unaddressed the issue of how justice will be delivered. A recent constitutional amendment establishes a system of transitional justice, which Colombia's attorney general has called a \"conditional amnesty, even for serious violation of human rights\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397772558\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/15/1350313213844/Indigenous-people-take-pa-008.jpg\" alt=\"Indigenous people take part in the 8th N\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Indigenous people gather in Bogot\u00e1 on Sunday before the talks start.

Civilians have been caught in the middle: tens of thousands have been killed or have disappeared in the past 25 years, and <a href=\"http://voiceofwitness.org/colombia/\" title=\"\">nearly 4 million people have been forced to flee from their homes</a>. About 6m hectares of land, an area roughly the size of Sri Lanka, were stolen by powerful landlords or rebel chiefs, or simply abandoned amid the violence.</p> <p>Since a peak in the late 1990s, when they fielded 20,000 fighters, the Farc's strength has waned after some of its leaders were killed or captured in a government military onslaught, which frightened hundreds of low- and mid-level fighters into deserting.</p> <p>The group is now led by a less hawkish, more pragmatic generation of commanders; Colombia's government, under Santos, is also more moderate than that of his predecessor, Alvaro Uribe, who vowed but failed to crush the rebels militarily.</p> <p>In the mountains of Cauca, the Farc's Sixth Front and Jacobo Arenas Mobile Column still show their strength. Under the command of Sargento Pascuas, one of the last remaining founders of the Farc, the rebels rule the daily lives of farmers at gunpoint, oversee the planting of coca bushes, the raw material of cocaine, and carry out deadly attacks that are aimed at the military and police but which often claim civilian victims.</p> <p>And the fighting won't stop during the negotiations. The government has insisted military operations against the Farc will carry on, and the Farc continues to attack while talking about peace.</p> <p>As much as he would like to see the Farc lay down their weapons, Medina is sceptical about the prospects for peace. \"The Farc may negotiate peace,\" he warns, \"but if no one pays attention to the peasants, indigenous groups [and] social movements, other groups will come and take their place.\"</p> <h2>Armed groups in Colombia</h2> <p>The Farc make up just one \u2013 albeit the most powerful \u2013 of many armed groups that contribute to the violence in Colombia. If a deal is reached for the Farc members to demobilise, the country will still have to deal with other rebel, paramilitary and drug-trafficking groups, which thrive in a country where democratic institutions are weak.</p> <p>\u2022 The National Liberation Army (ELN) is Colombia's second-largest leftist insurgency. The Cuban-inspired ELN is believed to have 1,000 to 1,500 fighters. Its leaders have made public overtures to the government about beginning a parallel peace process to the Farc negotiations, or joining in. It is unclear how or when the group may be included in the talks. A failure to negotiate simultaneously with the ELN would leave an opening for some Farc fighters who decide not to lay down their weapons to continue fighting the government.</p> <p>\u2022 The Anti-Restitution Army is a shadowy, paramilitary-style group that opposes the government's programme to return stolen land to displaced peasants. It targets leaders of victims' groups seeking restitution. At least 45 members of displaced communities seeking land have been murdered in Colombia since 2002.</p> <p>\u2022 Rastrojos, Urabe\u00f1os, Paisas: labelled by the government as emerging criminal bands, or bacrim, these groups are successors of demobilised paramilitary groups of the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AUC), which struck a deal to disarm with the Uribe government. While they are less ideologically driven than their predecessors, being dedicated mostly to drug trafficking, these neo-paramilitary groups continue to commit widespread abuses against civilians.</p>",
  "<p>If Margaret Thatcher and Andy Warhol were miraculously to conceive a child, the offspring would be an art fair \u2013 art as commodity, artist as worker, profit the driver and capitalist the dealer.</p> <p>Perhaps I'm being too harsh. As one international photographer commented to me: \"art fairs are a necessity.\" They offer artists exposure and an income stream, a slice of the financial pie \u2013 and it's a big pie. <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-12/elle-macpherson-browses-frieze-as-art-buyers-party-buy-1-4-million-rauch.html\" title=\"\">According to Bloomberg</a>, $350m worth of artworks were on sale at Frieze 2011.</p> <p>The exchange of capital for goods requires a facilitating market, a London Stock Exchange for art, and art fairs would argue they fulfil that function, bringing buyers and sellers together for mutually beneficial trade. Critics, on the other hand, argue that Frieze is more of an Ikea for millionaires \u2013 home furnishings replaced by somewhat tasteless art.</p> <p>Whichever view you take, the fact remains that fairs are growing in number and size. Now in its 10th year, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/frieze-art-fair-2012\" title=\"\">Frieze</a> is Europe's biggest commercial art fair and is expanding to new territories and sectors. What's the problem with this? As a practising artist, my biggest fear is the influence that art fairs have on an artist's practice. Let me give you two examples, one from Iran, the other a world-renowned London art school.</p> <p>During a conversation in his Tehran project space an Iranian artist-curator commented that Western curators were coming to Iran on shopping trips, chaperoned to the same artists' studios, buying work wholesale to feed a new appetite for contemporary Middle Eastern art from wealthy overseas private collectors. Over time, he observed artists adapting their work to match the tastes of buyers \u2013 a bit of calligraphy here, a woman in a chador there... cue sale.</p> <p>Cut to London. Royal College of Art graduate <a href=\"http://www.natashacaruana.com/\" title=\"\">Natasha Caruana</a> (co-founder with me of London arts venue <a href=\"http://www.studiostrike.com/\" title=\"\">studioSTRIKE</a><em>) </em>reflects on the unofficial mantra during her time at the <a href=\"http://www.rca.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal College of Art</a>: \"waiting to be picked up.\" The students are led to believe the graduation show is a make or break event. If the art is deemed commercial enough, the student merely waits to be picked up, packaged and promoted. Cue career.</p> <p>Both examples, set in differing cultural, geographical and political spaces, highlight what some would label as the disproportionate influence of certain gatekeepers, and the corrupting influence the promise of rapid wealth and exposure has on an artist's development and practice.</p> <p>That's not to say artistic integrity and income derived from art are mutually exclusive. The public sector, albeit squeezed, does exist to act as counterbalance to the commercial art world, taking a longer-term view to the short-termism and 'art as commodity' of the art fairs. Or as one fine art photographer confessed: \"I churn out editions of this particular series for the art fairs; it sells, it pays for my art practice.\" Maybe the way to play the game is for artists to give the market what it wants but hold back what really matters.</p> <p>It's difficult to suggest a viable alternative model. Perhaps the artist-run space and gallery offers the best solution. A model which one example, <a href=\"http://www.studiovoltaire.org/home.htm\" title=\"\">Studio Voltaire</a>, describes as \"placing the artist at the centre of everything we do.\" Commercial development co-existing with artist development, audience, education and outreach programmes.</p> <p>At present, many of the artists I know inhabit what Roman Krznaric describes in <a href=\"http://www.theschooloflife.com/shop/how-to-find-fulfilling-work/\" title=\"\">How to Find Fulfilling Work</a> as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/may/16/artists-finance-statistics-career-problems\" title=\"\">\"portfolio careers\"</a>: an art practice supported by a hinterland of satellite skills and employment, be they teaching, writing or other work. The balance is difficult, and it will be harder for a new generation of fine art graduates. Burdened by high university fees, the temptation to monetise an art practice will be greater.</p> <p>There is hope. For every Frieze there is an <a href=\"http://affordableartfair.com/uk/?gclid=CPvn94SWg7MCFcfKtAodz0oAFw\" title=\"\">Affordable Art Fair</a> \u2013 but the former exerts a disproportionate (some would say negative) influence on an artist's output. Maybe the future lies with a <a href=\"http://revolutionaryarts.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">Revolutionary Arts</a> model, which advocates bypassing the middlemen and gatekeepers in favour of artists taking control of their own distribution and destiny.</p> <p>The art critic JJ Charlesworth summed up Frieze as \"<a href=\"http://blog.jjcharlesworth.com/\" title=\"\">essentially a trade fair for rich collectors</a>\". Unlike most trade fairs, Joe Public is allowed into this one though with a frank <a href=\"http://friezelondon.com/visitors/\" title=\"\">caveat on the Frieze website</a>: \"Please bear in mind that the fair is also an event for galleries to conduct business. Please be aware of any behaviour that may disturb galleries.\"</p> <p>The implied message: pay the \u00a327 entrance fee, know your place and enjoy what Guardian critic Adrian Searle described as \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/oct/10/frieze-london-2012-speed-dating\" title=\"\">a collision of taste</a>.\" Judge it as a commercial circus and enjoy the acts and performances.

  "<p>Vladimir Putin has hailed victories by his supporters in regional elections as proof that Russia's citizens support him.</p> <p>Opposition activists alleged widespread fraud in Sunday's polls, in which candidates from Putin's United Russia party won all five races for governor and most elections for local parliaments. But a bigger problem was voter apathy, with turnout nearing record lows.</p> <p>Putin, meeting Russia's election chief on Monday, thanked voters for the result. \"For me, the elections results are not unexpected,\" he said. \"I think it's yet another step that confirms voters' intention to support the current institutions of power and the development of the Russian state.\"</p> <p>The elections, held in regions throughout Russia, were the first since Putin returned to the presidency in May amid unprecedented protests against the longtime leader's continuing rule.</p> <p>They were also the first to be held since Russia returned to the practice of electing governors \u2013 which Putin banned in 2004 as he moved to centralise control.</p> <p>Dmitry Medvedev, now prime minister, brought back the elections as one of his parting moves as president earlier this year \u2013 a move seen as an attempt to appease growing opposition among the urban middle classes. Putin added a so-called \"filter\" to the practice, leaving the Kremlin an outlet for control.</p> <p>The opposition shared videos of ballot-stuffing and reports of so-called \"carousels\" \u2013 vans driven from poll to poll so that paid voters could cast their vote more than once.

  "<p>Last Saturday, Weekend magazine invited 21 authors to try their hand at writing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/12/twitter-fiction-140-character-novels\">Twitter fiction</a>. As many of our book site regulars will remember, we've experimented with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/14/how-to-write-flash-fiction\">Flash Fiction fiction</a> in the past and discovered that writing a complete story in just 140 characters is no mean feat. </p> <p>The general consensus on Twitter seems to be that your favourite was Ian Rankin's story of betrayal and brutal revenge:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>I opened the door to our flat and you were standing there, cleaver raised. Somehow you'd found out about the photos. My jaw hit the floor</p> </blockquote> <p>That said, Helen Fielding's piece also got a lot of Twitter support:</p> <blockquote> <p>OK. Should not have logged on to your email but suggest if going on marriedaffair.com don't use our children's names as password.</p> </blockquote> <p>This wasn't a competition - we'll not be launching a new prize for brief literature any time soon, but it is interesting to see which stories you enjoyed. Many people mentioned Hemingway's famous short story: Baby Shoes. For sale. Never Worn. And <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18830738\">dinosaurio</a> quoted this by Augusto Monterroso:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Cuando despert\u00f3, el dinosaurio todav\u00eda estaba ah\u00ed.</p> <p>In English: \"When he(/she/it) woke up, the dinosaur was still there. </p> </blockquote> <p>Inspired by the author's Twitter fiction, many of you composed your own stories and shared them via Twitter. We've collected together a few below, but there just wasn't enough room to include them all, so I urge you to read them all by searching for the tag #140novel on Twitter. </p> <p>It's also not too late for you to add your own tale to the growing library, but please do remember to include the hashtag #140novel to ensure we don't miss your tweet, or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/12/twitter-fiction-140-character-novels\">post it in the comment thread under the article</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p>Eric saw flashing lights as he drove through the fog.

  "<p>\"Imagine how much easier life can be if you just take what you want,\" speaks my guide, as he leads me out of the island's tribal temple and into another mission of frantic gunplay and machetes in the dark. Far Cry 3 might be a little heavy-handed with the storytelling at times, but the points that it presents are so valid that it barely matters.</p> <h2>Choose your own misadventure</h2> <p>FC3 is a trip \u2013 a power trip, a sightseeing trip, and a head trip. I'm sent out into territory controlled by Vaas, a deranged local warlord and told to kill, and I do. Each mission, contained within the vast open world, is essentially a puzzle as walking into the middle of a gunfight is a surefire way to get killed in short order.</p> <p>Accessing the situation and plotting the best route \u2013 whether that's quiet backstabbing, well-timed distractions, artfully controlled destruction or all three \u2013 is the method for success.</p> <p>I opt for stealth more often than not, as most players will. The combat system is solid and visceral, with ranged weapons acting as a loud counterpoint to the trademark melee takedowns \u2013 catch a guard by surprise, or sneak up on him, and he's as good as dead.</p> <p>I spend minutes sneaking through the undergrowth, hiding behind burnt-out cars and discarded shipping crates, before bursting out and taking the high ground. I stab a sniper in the guts, drag his body behind cover, grab his rifle and free a caged tiger by shooting the lock off its prison \u2013 in the chaos as it tears through its captors, I pick off survivors while they run to safety. I feel powerful, I feel clever, and I feel dangerous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397885217\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Columnists/Columnists/2012/10/5/1349437235617/Far-Cry-3-008.jpg\" alt=\"Far Cry 3\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Far Cry 3</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This isn't even a story mission \u2013 this is a group of guards defending a base that I came across in the wilderness. FC3 is a hell of a thing.</p> <p>The sudden gifting of power is the game's core theme, shining a harsh light on what first-person shooters have been giving us for years as a matter of course. The protagonist Jason is deliberately, almost painfully an everyman. The opening sequence sees his proficient ex-military brother Grant shot in the neck, Jason frantically trying to stop him bleeding to death by tapping A to apply pressure to the wound, then fleeing into the jungle after he fails to keep him alive. In any other game we'd be taking control of Grant with his wealth of combat experience. Instead, we get his brother.</p> <p>Quite why Jason is suddenly so good at killing people is often questioned, and the unspoken answer to that question is that he's the lead character in an action game. Before the player arrived and took control, he wasn't, and as he meets his friends after he's come under new management (as it were) they note the change, and they're a little disturbed. Jason isn't behaving normally at all. Jason is a violent protagonist because you've made him into one, and the game isn't shy about telling you that.</p> <h2>All grown up<br></h2> <p>I'm given four and a half hours to explore the game, and I brush against maybe a 10th of the enormous map \u2013 moving through it using trucks, cars, hang-gliders and boats but mainly progressing on foot, as driving a car down the large dirt roads that connect settlements attracts the attention of enemy patrols and leads to desperate roadside gunfights.</p> <p>There are echoes of Far Cry 2 here, with the random mobs of machine-gun armed goons who chase you down at every turn. But here Jason can take over the countryside on behalf of the Rakyat, a group of warrior-people who take him into their ranks. With the Rakyat in place, fast-travel points are established and territories fall under their control, making them safe to navigate through.</p> <p>Having spent a fair amount of time on the previous titles, it's clear to see that this is the game that its sequels were supposed to be. Far Cry 1 was a standard first-person shooter stretched out thin; Far Cry 2 was an open-world game with guns, and too many lines of sight for enemies to abuse. Something about the environment, and the movement of the character within it, feels correct.</p> <p>Some bits stick out, of course. Coloured rocks covered in sigils are deposited around the map and unlock access to Trials of Rakyat, kill-frenzy style closed missions with an online leaderboard and prizes available for performing above the odds. Hang-gliders sit unattended on the top of cliffs, ready to be taken and flown between islands. An on-rails grenade launcher section after an escape from a burning mansion feels like every other one you've done before in every other action game. The story, while tight and involving four hours in, hints at something massive and unwieldy just over the horizon.</p> <h2>Down the rabbit hole we go<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397885218\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Columnists/Columnists/2012/10/5/1349437166942/Far-Cry-3-008.jpg\" alt=\"Far Cry 3\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Far Cry 3</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It would be easy to explain away the jarring elements in this otherwise seamless experience with the central conceit \u2013 that it's just a game, after all, that none of it is real. That's one reading of the story, certainly, and it covers a multitude of sins. But the narrative of the game layers more and more on top of the player, deliberately piling too much weirdness on them until they stop asking questions and just go with it.</p> <p>Jason is going mad \u2013 thanks to stress, and tiredness, and loss, and shock, and the fact that he's frequently drugged into hallucinatory visions. As the line between what's \"real\" \u2013 within the game world, anyway \u2013 and what isn't becomes increasingly blurred, a new boundary emerges: how much of Jason is the player? How do we separate our actions as the character from the character's internal drives? How comfortable do we feel taking pleasure in such violent acts?</p> <p>You don't need to play it as a highfalutin exploration into the nature of control, obviously \u2013 as mentioned above, it's an incredible action game (I'm making a lot of assumptions here based on early play; if it keeps up the pace it's going to be very, very good). But FC3 asks some pretty interesting questions.</p> <h2>Proactive horticulture<br></h2> <p>In a scene that will draw comparison's with the game's spiritual cousin, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIoJnMT3yUI\" title=\"\">Spec Ops: The Line</a> (a PTSD-ridden anti-war shooter released earlier this year) Jason is given a flamethrower by a man who claims to be from the CIA but might just be a conspiracy nut with a lot of professional-looking equipment in his basement. He's told to go and burn down drug plantations to attract the attention of bigger, more important warlords to the island, so he does.</p> <p>As well as burning crops, the flamethrower burns people \u2013 groups of soldiers that might have posed a problem beforehand are now easy pickings, as Jason leaps out from cover and immolates whole squads of them. Combat, always a careful combination of recon and timing, becomes far too easy and there's a jolt of pleasure in that because it's been so difficult beforehand.</p> <p>And then Jason says \"Man, I fucking love this gun!\" to no one in particular, and you realise that Jason's enjoying this as much as you are and you're playing a game while Jason is burning men to death in a drug-field.</p> <p>It's not subtle, but it's there. That's what takes Far Cry 3 from being an excellent videogame into something much more powerful, a comment on a medium that's only now starting to find its feet in the wider world of entertainment. In 10 years, games as revolutionary as this will be old hat. Enjoy it while it lasts.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Far Cry 3 will be released for PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 on 30 November</strong></p>",
  "<p><strong>Age: </strong>0.</p> <p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Proud, brave, cost-effective, pending.</p> <p><strong>What is it? </strong>A reserve force of volunteer soldiers, serving alongside regular army soldiers when and where required.</p> <p><strong>Like the Territorial Army. </strong>Like the TA, yes. But different.</p> <p><strong>How so?</strong> It will have a different name.</p> <p><strong>Is that all?</strong> No, but the defence secretary, Philip Hammond, has said he would like to rebrand the force so it \"sounds less like territorial defence and more like full integration with the army\". We already have the Royal Marine Reserves and the Royal Navy Reserves, but the TA's name is enshrined in law, and would require legislation to change.</p> <p><strong>What else would change?</strong> Hammond says he's \"not interested in reservists who want to play at being a soldier\".</p> <p><strong>What other attractions could the job possibly offer?</strong> More training, real army uniforms and top-notch equipment.</p> <p><strong>The better to play at being a soldier.</strong> Integration will be more comprehensive than that. Reservists will train alongside regular soldiers, ex-regulars will be encouraged to serve part-time and reserve numbers will be doubled as the army is reduced from 102,000 to 82,000.</p> <p><strong>So Hammond is just trying to plug a huge defence spending gap with some cut-price, part-time dad's army. Isn't that risky?</strong> Not if they're properly trained and deployed, says Hammond. \"At the moment not all reservists take their duties very seriously. The time for that is over.\"</p> <p><strong>But don't they all have proper jobs as well?</strong> Yes, but these reforms would see a reservist's commitment limited to one six-month period over five years, in a bid to keep employers on side.</p> <p><strong>When did the TA start?</strong> It was first formed in 1908 as the Territorial Force, the \"territorial\" part signifying that members were under no obligation to serve overseas. But they now participate in operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>\"I swear by almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to whatever it is we're calling ourselves this week.\"</p> <p><strong>Don't say: </strong>\"This is, like, the most hardcore paintballing weekend ever.\"</p>",
  "<h2>1) That was the season that was \u2026<br></h2> <p>Not the best, arguably the worst for a while, but will be remembered much more positively thanks mainly to Leeds. Their achievement in winning a fifth Super League title in six years, having finished fifth in the table for the second season running, takes the Rhinos into the sort of territory previously occupied by Wigan in the first half of the 1990s.</p> <p>Obviously they haven't been as dominant as those Wigan teams coached by John Monie that achieved four consecutive league and cup doubles between September 1989 and May 1993. But then again that was before Sky's money funded a full-time Super League, and the introduction of a salary cap which is supposed to ensure a more even spread of talent, and trophies.</p> <p>Little more than a week after the Grand Final, the dust is already settling on the 2012 season.</p> <p>The year Paul Wood dropped a bollock (or rather ruptured one, played on, and conducted one last interview with Ray French for BBC Radio Merseyside before heading off to have it removed).</p> <p>The year James Graham drew blood from Billy Slater's ear in the National Rugby League Grand Final \u2013 leaving the Scouse prop needing to achieve the sort of personal rehabilitation that Joel Monaghan has managed these last couple of years with Warrington. The support of <a href=\"http://www.watoday.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/tyson-backs-biter-graham-20121013-27jpj.html\" title=\"http://www.watoday.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/tyson-backs-biter-graham-20121013-27jpj.html\">Mike Tyson</a> was probably the last thing Graham would have wanted, as he continues to protest his innocence of biting, for which he has nevertheless received a lengthy suspension.</p> <p>The year St Helens moved to a smart new stadium at Langtree Park but suffered more memorable defeats there \u2013 to Daryl Millard's dramatic try for the Catalan Dragons, to Wigan on Good Friday, to Warrington in the play-offs \u2013 than they recorded notable wins. (Only the thrashing of a Leeds team who had dyed their hair red for Comic Relief would come into the latter category. But for what it's worth, I fancy Saints to return to either Wembley, Old Trafford or both in 2013, following the appointment of Nathan Brown as coach, and the recruitment of Willie Manu from Hull.)</p> <p>The year Brett Hodgson rose from the canvas to lead Warrington to a third Wembley win in four years \u2013 condemning Leeds to their third consecutive cup final defeat. But the Rhinos, who had started the season by beating Manly in a rousing World Club Challenge at Headingley with a stirring team performance in which Ryan Hall and Jamie Peacock were outstanding, bounced back to end it in even more satisfying fashion.</p> <p>With apologies to Doncaster and Sheffield Eagles, who won the Championship Grand Finals to provide the rugby league battlers of South Yorkshire with their greatest day since the Eagles stunned Wigan at Wembley in 1998, 2012 will be remembered most of all as the year of the Rhinos, and of their outstanding captain Kevin Sinfield.</p> <p>His leadership has been a constant through the six titles Leeds have won since 2004 in the most successful era in the history of the Headingley club, but this felt like a more personal triumph than any other. That's partly because it has been followed by his appointment as the national captain, for the forthcoming European Championship matches against Wales and France, and hopefully into next year's World Cup. But the Leeds coach Brian McDermott argued that Sinfield had also lifted himself to fresh peaks of performance during the play-offs, not only by landing 21 goals from as many attempts, but also by dragging his team through tough away games in Perpignan and Wigan.</p> <h2>2) \u2026 but it's not quite over yet<br></h2> <p>This is supposed to be a short off-season Set of Six, so a quick rattle through some other topics. The northern hemisphere autumn, or southern hemisphere spring, means internationals in rugby league. This is a disappointingly thin year, but there were a couple of contrasting games at the weekend. Australia beat New Zealand in what sounds like a decent occasion and an encouragingly competitive match in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6poy4HR-KA&amp;feature=youtu.be\" title=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6poy4HR-KAfeature=youtu.be\">Townsville</a>. At the other end of the scale, Ireland recorded an impressive victory over Scotland in front of 766 in Edinburgh.</p> <p>We shouldn't get too hung up on crowds \u2013 Edinburgh's rugby union team only managed 6,000 for a Heineken Cup game against Saracens at Murrayfield the previous day. But it's still disappointing that the excellent grassroots work going on in Scotland isn't receiving much support. It does seem ridiculous, despite that three-figure gate, that Scotland will play in Workington and Salford, but not Glasgow or Edinburgh, in the World Cup next year.</p> <h2>3) No Badger cull in Thailand</h2> <p>Next weekend it's on to Belfast, where Mark Aston's Ireland team face the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6poy4HR-KA&amp;feature=youtu.be\" title=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6poy4HR-KAfeature=youtu.be\">England Knights</a>; to Lens, where France play Wales in the first match of the <a href=\"http://www.ffr13.fr/index.php/equipes-nationales/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3852\" title=\"http://www.ffr13.fr/index.php/equipes-nationales/index.php?option=com_contentview=articleid=3852\">European Championship</a>; and to Bangkok, where Thailand play the Philippines in a game that would already have broken new ground for league, even before it became surely the first international in any sport to be <a href=\"http://stevemascord.com/2012/10/09/world-sports-first-husband-and-wife-refereeing-team/\" title=\"http://stevemascord.com/2012/10/09/world-sports-first-husband-and-wife-refereeing-team/\">refereed by a husband and wife</a>. Gavin Badger is an established NRL official, and Kasey, who met him through refereeing, has already made history by taking control of a Toyota Cup under-20s match. \"If I think he's done something wrong, he'll be able to tell by the way I glare at him\", Kasey has joked.</p> <h2>4) Another unlikely Oxtail</h2> <p>No sport does surreal quite like rugby league. From the husband and wife refereeing team called Mr and Mrs Badger, to the cans of soup named after a Wigan and England full-back \u2013 Beef, Tomkins and Onion flavour. But this is for a worthy cause, the Joining Jack appeal raising funds for research into Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Anyone tried the <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/heinz-big-soup-launch-beef-tomkins--onion-173091041.html\" title=\"http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/heinz-big-soup-launch-beef-tomkins--onion-173091041.html\">soup yet</a>?</p> <h2>5) Bulls building</h2> <p>From Beef and Tomkins to the Bulls, and plenty has happened at Odsal in the long break since the last Set of Six. The food theme continues, as they've been taken over by Omar Khan, a restaurant owner from Bradford, and despite the inevitable exodus of players, the club seem to be rebuilding intelligently following the appointment of Francis Cummins as coach. Retaining the gifted young forward John Bateman and the former London playmaker Luke Gale are two statements of intent, suggesting that Bradford will at least be capable of competing next season with the other Super League clubs who have fallen on hard times \u2013 Salford, Castleford and Hull KR.</p> <p>Their struggles provide a real opportunity for the likes of Widnes and London Broncos to surge up the table in 2013, and for Wakefield Trinity to consolidate the excellent season they enjoyed in 2012. But all that's a long way away for the moment.</p> <h2>6) Don't forget</h2> <p>Finally, a quick word for <a href=\"http://www.stateofmindrugby.com/cmspages/\" title=\"http://www.stateofmindrugby.com/cmspages/\">State of Mind</a>, the mental health charity for rugby league that was formed in response to the death of Terry Newton two years ago, and even made it to <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/rugby-super-league-final-mental-health\" title=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/rugby-super-league-final-mental-health\">Channel 4 News</a> this year. It continues to work closely with the 1eagu3 (League 13) players' association that was formed last year, with the results of its latest survey expected soon.</p>",
  "<p>Local government is ambitious. It is ambitious for its people, its areas and its economy and it has the ideas, the drive and the determination to take localism further. More than that, councils have proven that they can deliver localism in action, making a difference to communities.</p> <p>However, without fundamental changes to the relationship between central and local government, those ambitions will be hampered.</p> <p>In many respects, the infrastructure for localism is already in place.

Councils need to be freed from central control which constrains both ambitions for the future and their ability to play a full part in delivering much needed growth for the nation now.</p> <p>Local government is unique in that we are accountable to and have a democratic connection to local people. This puts councils at the heart of their communities. Councils also have a significant economic footprint, directly employing nearly two million people, making it a key player in local economies. The value of local solutions to national problems cannot be underestimated and at a time when the country is searching for answers to the economic crisis, councils are at the forefront of helping to deliver much needed growth.</p> <p>Of course, different approaches to local governance will be different from city to city, region to region and it is right that locally elected politicians have the freedom and the powers to make decisions which deliver maximum local benefit.</p> <p>Whether it's tax raising powers, deciding with partners on the best way to utilise ever-tightening budgets, determining planning applications or commissioning services it should not be a top down model imposed by central government. A 'one size fits all approach' is not the answer.</p> <p>The models by which public services have been delivered for the last 50 years are no longer affordable. In large part this is due to reductions in public spending, but we are also on the brink of significant increase in demand for services. Councils are best placed to manage these significant shifts in the supply and demand for public services.</p> <p>Councils are developing new and innovative ways of working to deliver better outcomes for their communities. Examples such as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2012/aug/29/second-wave-city-deals-greg-clark\" title=\"\">City Deals</a> negotiations, creation of <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/economic-development/leps/lep-toolbox/enterprise-zones\" title=\"\">Enterprise Zones</a> and<a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/decentralisation/communitybudgets/\" title=\"\"> Community Budgets</a> pilots have all illustrated that there is a demand for greater autonomy.</p> <p>The sector is widely regarded as the most efficient and increasingly, most innovative part of the public sector but as in the private sector, councils need the confidence that funding will be sustainable and that they will have the freedom to make decisions that deliver the right outcomes. One clear example of this is the reform of the public sector finance system to allow councils to retain uncapped and locally-decided council tax and business rates. This will give greater confidence that finance is sustainable and fair, providing a greater ability to take decisions that make a difference. This is incentivised localism.</p> <p>Removing central government's powers to decide local governance models and giving councils the freedom to provide public services which are not reserved to another body will free councils from some of the binds that tie and allow better local decision making.</p> <p>Too often, central government will localise problems without localising solutions. This is not localism but merely passing the problem down the line. The over-centralisation of economic policy remains a barrier to local growth. Some parts of Europe are getting this right. There are several models of local government which show that growth and investment are stronger where local authorities have the autonomy to lead economic development effectively.</p> <p>Councils have delivered much but the potential exists for so much more. They are hungry for change to allow them to get on with the job of delivering stronger local economies, attracting investment, creating jobs and new homes and delivering local services that matter to their people. For localism to be a reality, we need the powers, the freedom and the funding to be able to deliver local government and not just local administration.</p> <p><em>Sir Merrick Cockell chairs the Local Government Association</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>For a Conservative centre-right politician, Theresa May has proved rather enthusiastic about European co-operation on justice and home affairs. Indeed, one of her most effective campaigns since she became home secretary was to persuade Britain's European partners that they should hand over to the Americans not just the personal details of everyone who flies into and out of Europe, but those of the millions who travel on internal European flights as well.</p> <p>Unlike some of her predecessors who have made known their reluctance to sit through 20-minute speeches by the Latvian interior minister, May has been a very assiduous participant in European justice and home affairs councils since taking office nearly two and half years ago. As a former head of European affairs for the Association for Payment Clearing Services, she knows her way through the Brussels jungle.</p> <p>So it is something of a surprise to suddenly see her posing as the staunchest enemy of all things European when it comes to justice and home affairs. The home secretary is set to confirm Britain's intention to opt out of more than 130 police and criminal justice measures, under a banner of \"repatriating British powers from Brussels\".</p> <p>For some this is one of a series of measures that could deal Ukip a propaganda blow before the next election and amount to a less troublesome alternative to calling a straight in/out EU referendum. But as a <a href=\"http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/opt-out-and-suffer-the-consequences-eu-criminal-law-report-warns/\" title=\"\">Cambridge University study</a> has shown, the process is likely to prove little more than a game of Euro hokey cokey, with the risk that Britain ends up compromising its ability to police international crimes such as terrorism and drug trafficking.</p> <p>The academics argue that if Britain opts out of these measures, it will be left with little option but to ask the EU for permission to opt straight back into nearly all the measures involved. And those that Britain chooses to stay out of will be those with very little practical impact on the UK.</p> <p>The technical details stem from protocol 36 of the Lisbon treaty, which was negotiated in 2007 by Tony Blair. This gave the UK and Ireland the right to opt out en bloc of all the police and criminal justice measures adopted under the Maastricht treaty in 1992 before the EU court of justice in Luxembourg takes over jurisdiction of them. Britain has until June 2014 to decide whether to opt out of all these crime and justice measures agreed between Maastricht and Lisbon.</p> <p>As the Cambridge academics point out, it doesn't apply to all the measures agreed since Lisbon, such as directives on people trafficking, child sex abuse and pornography, the minimum rights of arrested suspects and cross-border measures to deal with victims of domestic violence. All of these will continue to be binding on the UK.</p> <p>What is at stake is the measures agreed between 1992 and 2007. The 100 Tory MPs who signed a Daily Telegraph letter demanding the opt-out said it would deal with the European arrest warrant, the European investigation order and the European public prosector. But the public prosecutor doesn't exist yet and so won't be affected, and the investigation order came in after the Lisbon treaty and the UK has already opted into it.</p> <p>The loss of the EU arrest warrant would be a serious blow to European police co-operation. The Eurosceptics have a point when they argue that it is a waste of money to spend \u00a330,000 sending a Pole back from London to Warsaw to face charges of 100 outstanding parking tickets. It is the Poles who have made most use of the system, but this problem could be dealt with simply by raising the threshold for the seriousness of the crimes involved. It doesn't mean that the entire system has to be dismantled.</p> <p>Opting out and then opting straight back in again to many of these measures will not come without a price attached \u2013 both in terms of political capital and practical cost. It is likely to be little more than an expensive dance of European hokey cokey.</p>",
  "<p>Amid the fanfare surrounding the historic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/15/scottish-referendum-countdown-begins-cameron-salmond\" title=\"\">independence referendum deal</a> there is one fat fly in the ointment. Democracy. All the polls suggest the majority of Scots (including Labour and Lib Dem voters) wanted three options in a two-question referendum including more powers for the Scottish parliament short of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/mar/07/scotland-spending-data-independence\" title=\"\">independence</a>.</p> <p>Now we know that Alex Salmond and David Cameron agree on only one thing \u2013 a one-question referendum will deliver clarity about the degree of autonomy most Scots want.</p> <p>It won't. A third option has been excluded for one reason only: it would win hands down.</p> <p>Ah, but the question is impossible to formulate, objectors have said. Devo plus would switch control of welfare benefits, income tax, corporation tax and oil revenues to Holyrood; Devo max would go further and send pensions, national insurance and Vat north, too. Which is it to be?</p> <p>Strangely, polling organisation TNS-BMRB has coped with this fairly easily.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.tns-bmrb.co.uk/research-publications/poll-on-future-government-of-scotland\" title=\"\">October 2011</a> the pollsters first offered a \"third\" option, \"transfer more powers from Westminster to the Scottish parliament, including tax and welfare but excluding defence and foreign affairs\" alongside \"full independence for Scotland\" and \"keep the current arrangement of a Scottish parliament with its existing powers\". Those options were backed by 33% (more powers), 28% (independence) and 29% (status quo) respectively. In <a href=\"http://www.tns-bmrb.co.uk/research-publications/referendum-for-an-independent-scotland-poll\" title=\"\">February</a> those options polled 30%, 26% and 32% and in <a href=\"http://www.tns-bmrb.co.uk/research-publications/latest-poll-on-scottish-independence\" title=\"\">July</a> 37%, 23% and 29%. In short \"more powers\" has generally been the most popular choice all year.</p> <p>In June Ipsos Mori found 56% backed a third option and a clear majority thought Holyrood should take control on tax (57%), the economy (57%), employment law (64%), welfare and benefits (67%), energy (64%).</p> <p>So mysteriously, an option with no agreed definition, no official support, no organised campaign, no first minister backing or former chancellor endorsement, no cash and no media profile has managed to gain supporters from both the Yes and No camps \u2013 and yet every single political party in Scotland has declared \"more powers\" to be a confusing irrelevance.</p> <p>I'd call that a democratic deficit of howling, whopping proportions. And I'd call it that whether I personally supported independence or the status quo. This may be the only chance Scots have for a generation to say precisely what they want. Now \u2013 as usual \u2013 democracy will be served by a large minority saying what they least dislike, or staying at home.</p> <p>Politically, the case for a \"more powers\" option is one the Lib Dems or Labour should have backed rather than the SNP. The Liberals have backed fiscally responsible home rule for Scotland since before the first world war and Labour delivered devolution. But the party hierarchies seem to be saying: \"We'll finish off the SNP first and deal with Scotland later.\" There will be no later. Look what happened to electoral reform after the AV referendum defeat. Nothing.</p> <p>Labour did take a giant leap into the unknown with devolution and much good has it done them \u2013 out of government in Scotland since 2007. Devolution seems to have unleashed the independence genie from the bottle, so Labour won't rush to remove the cork any further, triggering demands for \"full-fat independence\" in a few years. Why on earth would Labour \u2013 or the Lib Dems \u2013 volunteer for another act of constitutional largesse that results in a political kicking?</p> <p>Put simply, because their members, their voters and democracy demands it. There's no evidence more autonomy for nations within sovereign states necessarily results in independence \u2013 anywhere except binary Britain.</p> <p>But it's not over yet. The politicians have failed to offer a full range of options but the referendum will turn on the views of undecided voters, not the party faithful. Now the third option-supporting majority must extract from Labour and the Lib Dems what the SNP government could not \u2013 a guarantee (albeit with an uncertain implementation date) that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/mar/07/scotland-spending-data-independence\" title=\"\">taxation, economic and welfare powers</a> will be transferred to the Scottish government in the event of either party forming a government at the next UK election.</p> <p>Anything less is likely to prompt those disenfranchised in Scotland's single question referendum to campaign for a \"Yes\" vote. Is that clear enough?</p>",

The team remotely detached the capsule from the balloon, allowing it to fall back to Earth under its own parachute. It hit the ground 55 miles east of Baumgartner's own landing site. The balloon was deflated via a nylon \"destruct line\", with the lightweight balloon material \u2013 known as the envelope \u2013 falling back to Earth to be gathered and removed by truck. The capsule could, in theory, be used again, but the balloon envelope can only be used once.</p> <p><strong>Why did he not break up, or pass out, when he went supersonic?</strong></p> <p>The precise physiological exertions experienced by Baumgartner's body as he momentarily reached 833.9mph, or Mach 1.24, during his descent are still being studied by his team. One of the jump's key scientific goals was to learn, via a series of monitors on his body, more about what such an experience does to the human body. All we know is that he survived, which proves that pre-jump speculation that his body might explode or disintegrate due to the stresses were ill-founded.</p> <p>Baumgartner himself says that he felt very little as he broke the sound barrier because his insulated suit buffered him from external sounds and forces.</p> <p><strong>What was so special about the suit?</strong></p> <p>Baumgartner's suit and helmet were described by his team as \"his personal life-support system\". The suit was modelled on those worn by pilots of high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft, but it had never been tried in a free-fall before Baumgartner started testing it. It had four layers consisting of both \"breathable\" Gore-Tex, and heat- and flame-resistant Nomex. The internal layer was a \"comfort liner\". Next was a \"gas membrane\" that helped to retain air pressure. A \"restraint layer\" then helped to maintain the suit's shape. Finally, the external layer was constructed of Nomex to protect against fire and temperature extremes. It was made by a US company called David Clark that has been making suits for astronauts and high-altitude aviators since 1941.</p> <p><strong>Did he have to fast before the jump? (via </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nessymon\" title=\"\"><strong>@nessymon</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <p>For at least a day before the jump, Baumgartner consumed a \"low-residue, low-fibre\" diet on the orders of his medical team. They wanted his food to pass quickly through his body without any build-up of gas. In a low-pressure environment, the gas might expand and cause him severe internal pain \u2013 a condition known as barotrauma. For the same reason, Baumgartner, much like a deep-sea diver, also \"pre-breathed\" oxygen for two hours before his ascent in the balloon to help reduce the amount of nitrogen in his blood. If his pressurised suit had failed at above 19.2km (the \"Armstrong limit\", where water boils at body-temperature), he would probably have experienced a usually fatal condition known as ebullism \u2013 or the \"boiling\" of the blood \u2013 whereby his body would start to swell painfully within seconds. Baumgartner had a straw inside his helmet to allow him to consume liquids (presumably not a can of Red Bull, his key sponsor).</p> <p><strong>How much sleep did he get before the jump? (via @nessymon)</strong></p> <p>Baumgartner's team built a schedule to ensure he was fully rested. This involved going to bed precisely 12 hours before the ascent for an eight-hour sleep. But due to the hectic schedule on jump day, he was awake several hours before dawn. Baumgartner has said that he likes to draw in a sketchbook as a way to clear his mind before a major jump.</p> <p><strong>What was the biggest danger that Baumgartner faced?</strong></p> <p>His team identified 16 key risks that had to all be overcome for the record attempt to succeed. They included ultraviolet radiation, wind shear, landing impact, extreme temperatures, hypoxia (oxygen starvation), decompression sickness, entering a flat spin during the descent, \"shock-shock interaction\" (an explosive effect when shock waves in the air collide when passing through the sound barrier) and fire aboard the capsule. But the team said two dangers hung over Baumgartner above all others \u2013 a \"breach\" in the suit or capsule, and the accidental deployment of a parachute.</p> <p><strong>How did they know where he would fall?</strong></p> <p>Given that he reached a height of 24 miles above the surface of the Earth, it seems remarkable that he was able to land with such accuracy back on the desert floor in New Mexico. His team later confirmed that his landing site was just 23 miles from where the balloon had taken off several hours earlier. Unlike an astronaut, Baumgartner remained within the Earth's atmosphere so never experienced the planet rotating underneath him as witnessed by anyone actually in orbit. His team waited for the perfect weather conditions when high-altitude winds that might have caused his balloon to drift were at a minimum. Once he exited his free-fall by deploying his parachute, Baumgartner was able to \"steer\" himself to a preferred landing spot. A beacon inside his suit meant his recovery helicopter was able to closely follow him.</p> <p><strong>What next for Baumgartner?</strong></p> <p>\"I'm retired from the daredevil business,\" he said afterwards. \"I want to find a nice decent job as a helicopter pilot. I'll fight fires and rescue people. No e-mails, no phone calls.\"</p> <p><strong>How long will it be before every Tom, Dick and Harry adventure-seeker is queuing up to do this? (via </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18853398\" title=\"\"><strong>bateleur</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <p>The non-reusable balloon used by Baumgartner cost $250,000, with the wider cost to the sponsor Red Bull of the whole record attempt estimated to have cost many millions of dollars. This will put off the vast majority of copycats, but the high-profile stunt is expected to provoke a surge in interest for parachuting.</p> <p><strong>Is he married?</strong></p> <p>A surprising amount of questions on social networking sites seemed to be about his marital status. Bad news, though: Nicole Oetl, his girlfriend, was waiting alongside his parents for news of his safe return.</p>",

I didn\u2019t think it the best book on the shortlist (or even in the top four), but it\u2019s interesting and unusual \u2013 and as democracy has demonstrated, some people feel strongly about its merits. Congratulations to Ewan Morrison.</p> <p>But while we\u2019re on the subject, let\u2019s take a moment to consider the role of democracy in the Not the Booker. I am, I confess, still in a state of shock following the vote and the accompanying electioneering. The last 24 hours have been unusual, to say the least \u2026</p> <p>On Saturday night, I went to bed feeling that the Not The Booker had been unusually quiet this year. There had been no public authorial meltdowns. No name calling. No accusations of ballot-stuffing. The most exciting thing that had happened was that <a href=\"http://thesecondbesttime.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/ben-myers-some-good-words-from-bloke-up.html\">Ben Myers and Stephen May discovered they lived in the same village and went for a cup of tea together</a>. That was nice. But where was the drama? And more to the point, what was I going to say in my roundup article? </p> <p>I needn\u2019t have worried.</p> <p>On Sunday morning an email from one of the contenders started hitting the inboxes of just about everyone involved in the prize. It read:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>My friends, I apologise for the group email but time is running out. Here\u2019s an urgent plea \u2013 I\u2019m neck and neck in this NOT THE BOOKER competition \u2013 all of the other nominees have dropped out, apart from my adversary- who, it has to be said, is published by a big multinational company, and Tales from the Mall is published by a Scottish indie. So can you help us win?</p> <p>If you have nominated us in the past - Great, and thanks, but for us to win, you have to vote for us again. I know, this is horrible, and boring and no democracy could ever be based on such a voting system. But if you\u2019d like us to win then, please either vote for the first time or repost your nomination again on the NEW page. (BTW a humorous article against this farcical process will be posted soon.)</p> <p>First and second timers, the same simple strategy follows. </p> <p>Go to [<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/05/not-booker-2012-vote-winner\">this page</a>] to vote. Log in to the Guardian, go the to comments section at the bottom, find the box you can type in. Type in a variation on the words: \u201cI vote for Tales from the Mall in the final of the Not the Booker, this is the easiest/simplest way I can find to do so - I am posting my review here - Then write 100 words on Tales from the Mall. </p> <p>I\u2019m not happy about asking you to do this, as I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s the author\u2019s job to self promote, or that voting by the net is an advance in cultural assessment. But I\u2019m at a turning point in this whole industry \u2013 as is the industry itself - and I will not ask this of you again. My plan, if I win is to denounce the stupid voting by internet process and ask that next year they get a panel of people who understand and study books to be the judges. In the meantime though, I ask that you vote for Tales from the Mall, to support Scottish independent publishing and to give us a platform in the media to make a stand. On a personal level, if you can do this I will seriously owe you one. The deadline is tomorrow, the 14th of Oct, 10pm. This is a chore and maybe a bore, but if you can do this for me and Cargo Publishing, know that I will consider it a favour and you shall receive one in return on your asking.</p> <p>Cheers</p> <p>Ewan</p> </blockquote> <p>My sides are already preparing to peel themselves apart in anticipation of the \u201chumorous article\u201d. But before I get down to the serious business of laughing myself silly, and leaving aside the fact that it seems curious to lobby so hard to win a prize simply in order to \u201cdenounce the stupid voting by internet process and ask that next year they get a panel of people who understand and study books to be the judges\u201d, a couple of facts need to be corrected. No contenders had dropped out and Ben Myers (whom I presume to be Morrison\u2019s \u201cadversary\u201d) is published by tiny indy <a href=\"http://bluemoosebooks.com/\">Bluemoose books</a>.</p> <p>Yet we shouldn\u2019t judge Morrison\u2019s email on its veracity. Especially not when it\u2019s so much more enjoyable to grapple with its logic; something <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18852632\">our beloved regular poster AggieH did to typically amusing effect</a> after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18850535\">Morrison\u2019s eyebrow-raising email was posted on the voting pages by another commenter</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>I am tickled by the notion that ... Mr. Morrison had to devise such a cunning plan.</p> <p>Step 1: write a book.</p> <p>Step 2: have it published.</p> <p>Step 3: argue to have it included on the NTB shortlist after the NTB chairman has ruled it ineligible.</p> <p>Step 4: round up everybody you can to vote for it so that it wins.</p> <p>Step 5: accept a mug.</p> <p>Step 6: write an expos\u00e9 of the whole process.</p> </blockquote> <p>A wag on Twitter also asked: \u201cWonder why author shortlisted for NTB wants expert judges to make it like all the awards that never shortlist him?\u201d</p> <p>Even so, Mr Morrison deserves our sympathy. In fact, when his message was posted for all the world to see, and it became clear that he was actually going to win to boot, I began to worry that he might be going spare with shame and embarrassment. Not wishing him to suffer further disgrace, especially since I was mindful of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/14/not-the-booker-prize-contender-withdraws\">the pain the prize caused the author Cody James last year</a>, I decided to drop Morrison a line offering him a chance to collect his coat. I include that message below to give context for what happened next. Which is extraordinary.</p> <p>[A quick bit of background: I\u2019d been in touch with Morrison on Sunday already, because I\u2019d had to send him a message asking him to stop giving out my email address \u2013 and also to make his friends to stop emailing me on the day of rest. He\u2019d replied with an apology for that and various other faux pas, hence the following subject line:] </p> <blockquote> <p>Sent: Sunday, October 14, 2012 6:59 PM</p> <p>Subject: Re: I\u2019m gutted that I offended you</p> <p>Don\u2019t worry Ewan, there\u2019s certainly no hard feelings on my part. I know from watching it several years on the trot how stressful the whole experience can be for authors. I\u2019m mainly amused \u2013 just a little sorry you\u2019ve ended up in such a pickle. If you wanted to save yourself a bit of embarrassment tomorrow and drop out I\u2019m sure we\u2019d be able to help you\u2026</p> <p>All the best,</p> <p>Sam</p> </blockquote> <p>I then received three replies in quick succession. I didn\u2019t respond to any, and shan\u2019t say anything now, except to note that Morrison did indeed get the most votes. You can judge for yourself:</p> <blockquote> <p>Sent: Sunday, 14 October 2012, 19:13</p> <p>Subject: Re: I\u2019m gutted that I offended you</p> <p>Sam, a graceful reply, which I am grateful for. Thank You. Drop out? I\u2019m a student of Nietzsche and \u201cculture is conflict\u201d. What embarrassment do you refer to?</p> <p>All the best </p> <p>Ewan</p> </blockquote> <p>then</p> <blockquote> <p>Sent: Sunday, 14 October 2012, 19:27</p> <p>Subject: Re: I\u2019m gutted that I offended you</p> <p>Sam, </p> <p>What do you mean by \u201chelp me\u201d? I\u2019m a bit concerned by your tone here. All I want is a fair fight. I have \u2018friends\u2019 counting votes here in Scotland.

  "<p>Wendy Greengross, who has died aged 87, was a pioneering counsellor, agony aunt and author of empowering publications about sexuality, ageing and disability. Always eloquent, she had a passion for her subject and an accessible style that led to broadcasting success.</p> <p>In the early 1970s, Wendy joined the innovative Radio 4 counselling programme If You Think You've Got Problems, which ran on Sunday evenings for nearly eight years. She hosted her own short-lived show, Let's Talk it Over, on BBC1 in 1973 and was an adviser on the soap opera Crossroads (it was Wendy who suggested that the character Sandy should use a wheelchair after suffering an accident). In 1972 she began a weekly column, Heart to Heart with Doctor Wendy, in the Sun, staying for four years until she felt the letters passed to her were more about titillation than education.</p> <p>She was born in Brent Cross, north London, to Morris and Miriam Greengross. Her father, a jeweller, was given the first tools of his trade by the Jewish Board of Guardians, which later became the welfare agency Jewish Care, one of many organisations with which Wendy worked. He was a councillor, alderman and mayor in Holborn, setting an example of public service that would become central to Wendy's life.</p> <p>In 1936 she started at South Hampstead high school. During the second world war she was evacuated with the school to Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire. She was keen to pursue a medical career, but at the time only a few of London's medical schools accepted women and a strict quota system existed. Nevertheless, in 1943 Wendy was offered a place at University College hospital. She qualified in 1949 and was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to the Chicago Lying-in hospital. While doing locum work before she left for the US, she met Alex Kates, a surgeon. Normally the most cautious of men, after a week he asked her to marry him, and the wedding took place seven months later, in 1951. By 1959 they had five children.</p> <p>Wendy was determined to better the lives of the disadvantaged and her ideas were often years ahead of their time. She and her husband took over a large general practice in Tottenham, north London, which also offered family planning. Soon it became the first practice in the UK to employ a marriage guidance counsellor. Wendy continued to work as a GP for almost 35 years, drawing on her clinical experience for many of her ideas.</p> <p>Having trained as a counsellor with the Marriage Guidance Council (now Relate), her work with the Association of Jewish Youth led her into the area of sex education and her first two publications, Sex in the Middle Years (1969) and Sex in Early Marriage (1970). Both attracted notoriety and success, since she was unequivocal \u2013 scandalously so for the time \u2013 that women enjoyed sex and continued to do so into later life, and that married women were entitled to sexual pleasure. Drawing on case histories of women she had treated, Wendy challenged the traditional view that women put up with sex for their husband's sake.</p> <p>She sustained this theme of empowerment with Entitled to Love \u2013 The Sexual and Emotional Needs of the Handicapped (1976) and Sex and the Handicapped Child (1980). She argued, again controversially for the time, that people with disabilities were still sexual beings and should be respected as such. She also argued that parents needed to come to terms with their children attaining sexual maturity, even in the face of mental or physical difficulties. In 1972 she became a founder member of Sexual Problems of the Disabled, which she later chaired.</p> <p>Ill health and Alex's death in 1982 might have led Wendy to slow down. Instead she joined the Warnock committee, examining human fertilisation and embryology. She also had a key role in a pastoral care programme for rabbinical students at Leo Baeck College in London. Rabbi Tony Bayfield described her as one of the most important postwar figures in the Jewish reform movement. In 1985 the Reform Synagogue of Great Britain published her pioneering booklet Jewish and Homosexual, in which she wrote: \"It is easy to identify underprivileged groups who need charity. It is more difficult to identify the groups that need compassion and meet their needs, for we often assume, wrongly, that their troubles are of their own making, and as a result withdraw the emotional support that they require.\"</p> <p>Wendy was involved in the creation of <a href=\"http://www.raphaeljewishcounselling.org/\" title=\"Raphael, the Jewish counselling service\">Raphael, the Jewish counselling service</a>, joined a working party on the future of the family and was a board member and regular contributor to the magazine Manna, published by the <a href=\"http://www.reformjudaism.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Movement for Reform Judaism</a>. In 1991, with her sister-in-law, Sally Greengross, she wrote Living, Loving and Ageing. She served as a trustee of the Leonard Cheshire Foundation (now <a href=\"http://www.lcdisability.org/\" title=\"\">Leonard Cheshire Disability</a>), where she remained for 25 years and was a vice-president at the time of her death.</p> <p>Wendy is survived by her daughters, Hilary and Polly, sons Nick and Richard, and three grandchildren. Her son Trevor died in 1997.</p> <p>\u2022 Wendy Greengross, doctor, counsellor and author, born 25 April 1925; died 10 October 2012</p>",
  "<p>Reddit is the biggest and most influential website you've probably never heard of. The self-styled \"home page of the internet\", it can pull in more than 3bn page views a month. An article posted on its front page can expect to pull in half a million extra visitors, at minimum \u2013 and it was given extra gravitas last month when it was judged worthy of an <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=feed\" title=\"\">online campaign stop</a> by President Barack Obama himself.</p> <p>But just when it should be celebrating a moment of triumph and recognition, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/12/reddit-blocks-gawker-creepshot-photos\" title=\"\">site has been thrown into chaos </a>by a bitter row stemming from its seamy underbelly \u2013 and it's a row that could have far wider consequences across the internet. The problem stems from several boards on the site (knows as \"subreddits\") concentrating on \"creepshots\" and \"jailbait\" \u2013 sneaked photos, taken on the street or lifted from profiles \u2013 which focused on obtaining and publishing revealing pictures (including upskirt shots) of unwitting women, or underage girls.</p> <p>After sustained outcry, the site banned most of these subreddits, but Gawker writer Adrian Chen \u2013 a journalist who regularly seeks online notoriety, often successfully \u2013 had tracked down the real identity of the man behind many of these forums, interviewed him, and <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5950981/unmasking-reddits-violentacrez-the-biggest-troll-on-the-web\" title=\"\">on Friday published a lengthy article \"outing\" him</a>.</p> <p>Reddit reacted furiously, in large part because the user, \"violentacrez\", was a prominent one and on friendly terms with many of the people who run the site.</p> <p>New media's reaction to the dilemma was far more extreme than that of old media: Reddit moved to stamp out the article, and punish its writer. The volunteer moderators who run many of the largest sections of Reddit elected not just to ban links to that particular article, or even articles by that particular writer \u2013 instead, they imposed a ban on all links to Gawker, or any other sites affiliated with it. Want to post a link to Gawker's stories on <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5933641\" title=\"\">Bain Capital's internal documents</a> on Reddit? You can't. For a time, the site's paid staff even introduced a site-wide ban on links to the article, before backtracking.</p> <p>Why is this any more than just a stupid online argument between Gawker and some forum moderators? The answer lies in Reddit's almost unique online role. Unlike many other sites similar in scale, Reddit has stayed fairly true to the anarchic, freewheeling spirit of the early internet. Baffling to outsiders, Reddit is laced with memes, trends \u2013 and as a result, a certain political culture is shared among a huge swath of its user base.</p> <p>At the core of that is a veneration for free speech and a free internet that borders on the obsessive: the successful battle against <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act\" title=\"\">US anti-piracy bills Sopa and Pipa</a> was driven from Reddit, as was much of the online resistance to the subsequent (defeated) cyber-security bill Cispa. Redditors are regularly among the first to rage at any hint of \"corporate censorship\" from Google, Twitter or Facebook. They've also regularly come to the defence of sites sharing links to copyrighted content \u2013 based around a precedent in US law that a hyperlink is speech, and so protected under the first amendment.</p> <p>Free speech is also the argument respected Redditors have used time and again to defend the site's sleazy side. Hey, they say, we don't like these guys posting upskirt shots of women, but \u2026 it's free speech!</p> <p>All of which makes the actions of Reddit's core community, the volunteers who run most of the site \u2013 backed up tacitly by the staff \u2013 so bizarre and counterproductive. Reddit's mods aren't boycotting a site they dislike: they're imposing a ban against it on millions of users. They haven't reluctantly imposed censorship to comply with national law, or even with Reddit's own policies (the site is vehemently against trying to \"out\" users' real identities). Instead, they've issued retaliatory bans against a writer, and his outlet, because they don't like what he is saying.</p> <p>Reddit's new stance appears to be that free speech is great \u2013 as long it's speech it agrees with. Which is a position the <a href=\"http://www.riaa.com/\" title=\"\">RIAA</a> (which seeks to close sites linking to pirate content), or even China's Communist party could happily agree with.</p> <p>It really has created the perfect Platonic form of fail: not only have the members of Reddit's core community made themselves look like hypocrites on an issue incredibly close to their userbase's heart, they have done it in order to protect a user who created forums to post content which was at best sleazy, and which at its worst bordered on the paedophilic. For those trying to change the law in ways Reddit dislikes, Christmas, Easter and several birthdays have come all at once.</p> <p>At minimum, the farrago reveals that a site with huge influence in selecting which stories and content will take off online is less democratic by far than it appears \u2013 and is instead subject to huge control by an apparently capricious group of mods. At worst, the row will undermine the causes their tens, at times hundreds, of millions of users stand for. Next time Reddit issues the battle cry against a new law affecting the internet, who will saddle up?</p>",
  "<p>Mohamed Bashir Sheik has a new reason to hope. The 25-year-old Somali, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jul/04/entrepreneurs-kenya-dadaab-refugee-camps\" title=\"\">who came to live at the world's largest refugee camp</a> in Dadaab, Kenya, when he was just four, is planning to apply for a place at a university that is due to open next year near to the settlement.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ku.ac.ke/\" title=\"\">Kenyatta University</a> is setting up a campus in Dadaab, which is home to a sprawling complex of camps housing around 470,000 refugees, mainly Somalis who crossed the nearby border to escape the cycles of war and drought in their homeland.</p> <p>Courses in subjects including project management, marketing, finance, and peace and conflict studies will be on offer to refugees and locals in this remote town in north-east Kenya, 90km (55 miles) from the border with Somalia.</p> <p>The site was <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/507570199.html\" title=\"\">inaugurated last week</a>, and the first students are scheduled to enroll in January. Bashir Sheik, a father of three who works for a <a href=\"http://dadabcamps.com/\" title=\"\">website that provides news about the refugee camp</a>, hopes to be among them. \"I want to go to Kenyatta University and study mass communications. I'm going to register,\" he said by telephone from Dadaab.</p> <p>\"I'm a journalist and I've never attended a single training [session] or workshop. I wish to further my career,\" said Bashir Sheik, who is from Kismayo, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/kenyan-soldiers-capture-kismayo-somalia\" title=\"\">Somali port city that African Union peacekeepers recently seized</a> from Islamist al-Shabaab militants.</p> <p>Dominik Bartsch, head of operations for the UN Refugee Agency, said the agency would try to forge partnerships with universities and donors to offer scholarships to refugees. \"There is no tertiary education in any refugee site worldwide,\" he said. \"A site was made available and now Kenyatta University has to proceed and put everything in place.\"</p> <p>Bartsch said the university has already allocated two-thirds of its places to refugees, with the rest earmarked for locals. \"The fact that this is straddling the two [communities] is good news,\" he said. Refugees will be able to use their professional qualifications not only to contribute to Kenyan society, but eventually to aid in rebuilding their own country on their return, he added.</p> <p>Josephine Gitome, director of Kenyatta University's Centre for Refugee Studies and Empowerment, said self-sponsored students and those backed by donors are due to start in January. The next batch of students admitted under the <a href=\"http://crs.yorku.ca/bher\" title=\"\">borderless higher education for refugees project</a> will join early next year and will have tuition fees waived.</p> <p>According to Bashir Sheik, some refugees currently try to pursue their studies through correspondence courses with Nairobi-based universities, and some vocational training is also available, but many refugees want \"education on their doorstep\". \"We had more than 5,000 school leavers last year and they don't have anywhere to go for further education,\" he said.</p> <p>The presence of so many Somali refugees in Kenya \u2013 in Dadaab and in Nairobi \u2013 has long been controversial, with Kenyan <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/22/kenya-denies-plan-to-close-refugee-camp\" title=\"\">government officials repeatedly calling on international NGOs to repatriate Somalis</a> to safe areas in their homeland. These calls have increased in recent months as African Union peacekeepers, including Kenyan troops, have begun notching up victories against al-Shabaab, whose fighters impose a harsh form of sharia law in the areas of Somalia they control. The peacekeepers, known as Amisom, drove al-Shabaab out of the capital, Mogadishu, last year and have seized a string of towns in the south.</p> <p>Aid agencies have warned that it is too early to talk about sending refugees home, especially given the conflict. Many Somalis in Dadaab have spent all their lives there, raising their children in the camps. This month, <a href=\"http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/press/release.cfm?id=6329&amp;cat=press-release\" title=\"\">M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF, or Doctors without Borders) said</a>: \"While Somalia remains embroiled in armed conflict, calls for the repatriation of refugees are grossly premature. Security conditions on the ground do not allow for adequate protection or the secure delivery of humanitarian aid.\"</p> <p>MSF added that more should be done to help the refugees in Dadaab. \"We are seriously questioning the overall level of assistance provided to the refugees,\" said Bruno Jochum, MSF's general director. \"With security conditions worsening, basic services and the provision of aid have been significantly reduced so it is no surprise that refugees are again facing disease outbreaks.\"</p> <p>MSF said there had been cholera cases and an outbreak of hepatitis E in the three camps that make up Dadaab. It called for the immediate resumption of registering new arrivals, and warned that there was \"an alarming lack of shelter and sanitation infrastructure\", with the rainy season about to start.</p> <p>Dadaab was set up in 1991 to accommodate around 90,000 refugees. Yet during last year's famine in Somalia, around 160,000 people came to Dadaab as hundreds of thousands of Somalis fled into neighbouring countries.</p> <p>Rising numbers and a spate of bombings and kidnappings, which forced many relief agencies to reduce their activities, have strained basic services at the camp. In July, eight aid agencies said around 164,000 children \u2013 more than 70% of those in Dadaab \u2013 were not in school. Children who did go to school were attending classes of more than 100 pupils. \"Lack of education and employment opportunities increase the potential for disenfranchised youth to be recruited into militia and banditry,\" <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressrelease/2012-07-12/emergency-funds-running-dry-dadaab-worlds-largest-refugee-camp\" title=\"\">the agencies said</a>.</p> <p>Mohamed Hassan Dirige plans to apply for a place at the new campus. Dirige, who teaches at Dadaab, said many school leavers end up teaching younger children in the camp because they lack opportunities for further study. \"The students really need it. They will get opportunities,\" said Dirige, who arrived in Dadaab aged five in 1991, the year that military dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown in Somalia.</p>",

Presumably aided by crates of their own product, it wasn't a bad day either for the countless sponsorship, media and production staff employed by Red Bull \u2013 the energy drinks brand that conceived, paid for and covered the stunt.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/14/sebastian-vettel-wins-korea-gp-f1\" title=\"\">A one-two in the Korean GP</a> for the Formula One team they own, followed by an event likely to go down in the syllabus at PR colleges in years to come was the reward for an event that was seven years in the planning. In coming up with innovative new ways to sell heavily caffeinated fizzy water, the brand is also seen as redefining the sports sponsorship market.</p> <p>Sponsorship experts said on Monday that the online frenzy around Baumgartner's leap served to highlight trends that had been emerging for some time, as sponsors moved away from traditional models and towards their own bespoke spectaculars.</p> <p>\"The biggest trend in the last 10 years, and the social internet side of things has merely accelerated it, is that creating your own content has absolutely moved to the top of the agenda. The hackneyed old tickets, hospitality and perimeter boarding model is being left behind,\" said Tim Crow, chief executive of the sponsorship agency Synergy.</p> <p>Major brands have been talking for years about becoming content producers rather than simply paying media and rights owners to advertise or slap their logos on shirts and hoardings. But none have taken it as seriously as Red Bull.</p> <p>Red Bull were an early pioneer, trading in their sponsorship of a Formula One team to buy their own in 2004, for example. A couple of years later they bought the Major League Soccer team that was renamed New York Red Bulls. But most of their investment has been in extreme sport and in building up long-term links with individual athletes \u2013 funding an army of base jumpers, free runners, snowboarders, cliff divers and BMX riders for whom they could create bespoke events and completely control the content around.</p> <p>To take but two examples, they have arranged for Robbie Madison to leap on to the Champs Elys\u00e9es on a motorbike and built a private halfpipe for snowboarder Shaun White and filmed the results. In May the BMX rider Kye Forte conceived an event bringing together 34 of the world's best riders to perform huge jumps against the London skyline in front of 10,000 fans at Alexandra Palace.</p> <p>Red Bull insists that its stunts start with conversations with their athletes \u2013 Baumgartner, who had already leaped from most of the world's tallest buildings, came up with the idea for his space jump seven years ago.</p> <p>Red Bull also conceives entirely new events such as its cliff-diving world series, a global series of stunt plane races through major cities and Crashed Ice, where former ice hockey stars race one another down the sides of mountains and through Alpine towns.</p> <p>Some have, er, flown while others have proved less successful. But Red Bull, through its own magazines and production arm, can also ensure that their events reach the desired audience regardless of whether they capture the imagination of the mainstream media.</p> <p>Red Bull's two Media Houses \u2013 a 100,000 square foot operation in Santa Monica and its HQ in Salzburg \u2013 was not conceived as a loss leader and in the long term is expected to become profitable in its own right. The Red Bull chief executive Dietrich Mateschitz told the US business magazine Fast Company that the concept of investing in events rather than merely sponsoring them was deeply ingrained in the company's culture.</p> <p>\"We have been doing this for 20 years \u2013 now it's called adventure sports, extreme sports, and outdoor sports. Most of the national Austrian champions in those days were personal friends of mine and we spent all our leisure time mountain biking, windsurfing, snowboarding etc,\" he said.</p> <p>\"From the first year onwards, we also started sampling our product with our Red Bull Minis, launched our advertising campaign with our cartoons, and created our first event Red Bull Flugtag.\"</p> <p>The model requires huge, long-term investment and a determination to blur the lines between the investments in sport and music and the company's core product. The key is total control \u2013 recently aided by shifting media models, and the fact they can now broadcast direct to the viewer via the internet.</p> <p>Sunday night's stunt was a perfect illustration of that trend. As the capsule ascended to the edge of space and the tension escalated, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/15/felix-baumgartner-skydive-social-networks\" title=\"\">so the audience watching on YouTube also grew and the chatter on social media got louder</a>.</p> <p>Because Red Bull controlled the production, and broadband speeds and technology have reached a point where watching from anywhere is a reality, by the time Baumgartner was ready to jump there were over 8 million people viewing online. Immediately after he landed safely, Red Bull solicited questions via Twitter and Facebook <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/video/2012/oct/15/felix-baumgartner-skydive-space-video\" title=\"\">to put to the former base jumper</a>. During and afterwards, half the worldwide trending topics on Twitter related to the Austrian's historic jump.</p> <p>But because it could then provide all manner of arresting royalty-free images and footage, Red Bull received blanket coverage in mainstream media too. While it is dangerous to draw too many lessons from what was in many ways a glorious one-off, the effects of Baumgartner's epic achievement are likely to be already sparking urgent questions in the boardrooms of jealous rivals across the globe.</p>",

Then there's <a href=\"http://www.ilovebluesea.com/\" title=\"\">I Love Blue Sea</a>, a social media marketplace for sustainable seafood, similar in thinking to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/foodhub-foodex-sustainable-food-distribution-collaboration?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Foodhub</a>. In presentations and debates ranging from using big data for energy efficiency and solar connectivity, to creating a sharing economy for developing nations and mobilising a new generation of environmental activists, it was simply assumed that social media would drive and facilitate change.</p> <p>It's about time. For too long now social media has been viewed as just another way for companies to market and sell stuff. Even the more recent explosion in what is termed social business - using social media thinking and tools to reshape key operations inside companies - has focused on a single bottom line rather than the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit.</p> <h2>A meeting of values</h2> <p>Listening to the new generation of sustainability ideas coming out of SXSW Eco left me convinced that social media's most profound contribution to business will be delivering sustainability throughout business. For a couple of years, social media's potential has been clear to sustainability professionals and communicators. Social media is underpinned by the need to be transparent and authentic and is dependent on collaboration and a strong community. Those values also are crucial in practicing sustainability so it was an easy leap for companies to embrace social media as a way of communicating sustainability and CSR initiatives.</p> <p>But that's just one part of the sustainability puzzle. As many PR and marketing departments have found, it's actually quite difficult to use social media to talk sustainability if you aren't actually operating as a sustainable company. For social media and sustainability to really combine and drive change in companies, the two business philosophies need to be applied throughout the organisation - think of it as sustainable social business, or Social Inc. for want of a better term.</p> <h2>So what would a Social Inc. achieve?</h2> <p>It would create a social network to manage the responsible and transparent sourcing of natural resources; it would use social media technology both to streamline the supply chain and make it more socially and environmentally responsible; it would create transparent streams of information and conversation that would make executive board accountable to all stakeholders and not just the stock-market driven whims of institutional investors. Oh, and it would give employees a voice in conception, design and execution of new sustainable products.</p> <p>Some companies have already started down this route. Salesforce.com touts the energy efficiency potential of its cloud computing services while IBM is drawing on the experience of its Social Business and Smarter Planet operations to create bespoke sustainability programmes for clients. And, no doubt, much like the early days of social media adoption within companies, many more Social Inc. experiments are currently taking place within companies - often without the knowledge of the CEO or executive board.</p> <p>The groundwork has been done. Today social media is no longer an experimental tool, it is a multi-billion dollar industry. Companies such as Starbucks, PepsiCo, Intel and Dell have demonstrated the power of using social tools and technologies to improve their internal and external operations. Imagine how the likes of Unilever, Marks &amp; Spencer, Walmart and others could deliver on their ambitious sustainability goals by harnessing all that social media thinking and expertise.</p> <p>So far we've only scratched the surface of what social media and sustainability can achieve.

  "<p>There is an intrinsic paradox to My Way being the pop song most commonly chosen as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/15/pop-music-funeral-survey-co-op\" title=\"\">a funeral anthem</a> by British people. Death is a solemn business and one shouldn't mock what is, for most of us, so distressing that thinking straight is difficult. But if the deceased really went through life doing everything \"their\" way, why choose, for their farewell, the same musical tribute as all the others?</p> <p>Although the song is indelibly associated with Frank Sinatra and Shirley Bassey, the lyrics were composed by another singer-songwriter, Paul Anka. Those as close as I am to choosing their last song will recall Anka bursting onto the scene, aged 16, in 1957 with his No 1 hit, Diana. Its lyrics were of a feebleness which, to my ear, is still unrivalled:</p> <blockquote> \"I'm so young and you're so old <br>This, my darling I've been told <br>I don't care just what they say <br>'Cause forever I will pray <br>You and I will be as free <br>As the birds up in the trees <br>Oh, please, stay by me, Diana.\" </blockquote> <p>Ten years later the still youthful Anka adapted French hit Comme d'Habitude (\"Like I Always Do\"), which in turn was translated from an original English song For Me. He did it, said Anka, \"for Frank\". Apparently Ol' Blue Eyes was accompanied by \"two mob guys\" when the transaction happened. Offers beyond refusal, etc.</p> <p>The 26-year-old Anka had undoubtedly made progress as a lyricist but My Way remains a ditty of ineffable banality. The rhymes come in like sledgehammer blows to the skull:</p> <blockquote> \"And now the end is near <br>So I face the final curtain <br>My friend, I'll say it clear <br>I'll state my case of which I'm certain\" </blockquote> <p>The \"case\" (is he in court?) includes such declarations as:</p> <blockquote> \"Yes, there were times, I'm sure you know <br>When I bit off more than I could chew <br>But through it all when there was doubt <br>I ate it up and spit it out <br>I faced it all and I stood tall <br>And did it my way\" <br> </blockquote> <p>It's not clear to me, at least, what all this gobbling and spitting (surely \"spat\", by the way) is about. How can you \"eat\" something (ie swallow it) and then \"spit\" it out. Surely it should be \"puked it out\". Myself I think I would replace this stanza with the Sid Vicious rewrite:</p> <blockquote> \"There were times, I'm sure you knew <br>When there was fuck fuck fuck-all else to do <br>But through it all, when there was doubt <br>I shot it up or kicked it out <br>I faced the wall and the world <br>And did it my way\" </blockquote> <p>Unlovely, I know, and not suitable for every church in the land, but it makes a lot more sense.</p> <p>In 1967, when he recorded it, Sinatra (standing tall at 5ft 7in in his elevated shoes) was, aged 51, some 31 years short of his final curtain. At that funeral ceremony the attendees were serenaded with a thunderous version, by Frank himself, of Put Your Dreams Away:</p> <blockquote> \"Put your dreams away for another day <br>And I will take their place in your heart <br>Wishing on a star never got you far <br>And so it's time to make a new start\" </blockquote> <p>As one of the mourners later recalled: \"You could hear everyone gasp \u2026 'Aaaah.' \u2026 It was like he rose up on the edge of the coffin; like he was saying, 'Hey, check this out!'\" One is reminded of the old Hollywood joke: \"I went to his funeral to make sure the old bastard was really dead.\" So he was. But \"the Voice\" (as Sinatra was nicknamed) lives on and will do, it seems, as long as people keep dying.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Richard Hughes rides first five Windsor winners</strong></h2> <p>Richard Hughes rode the first five winners on the card at Windsor on Monday. </p> <p>He began with a double for his father-in-law Richard Hannon. Pivotal Moment (13-8 joint-favourite) won the EBF Joe Ward Hill Memorial Maiden Stakes, after which East Texas Red (5-2 favourite) claimed the davisbakerycaribbean.com Nursery. </p> <p>Hughes then donned the famous Khalid Abdullah silks for Amanda Perrett's Embankment (7-1) in the Ladbrokes Game On! Maiden Stakes. </p> <p>The most impressive winner, though, was the Jeremy Gask-trained Magic Street (4-1 favourite), who streaked to a five-length win in division one of the Ladbrokes Mobile Handicap. Then, on the well-backed Links Drive Lady (5-2), the Irishman continued a spectacular day.</p> <h2><strong>Today's selections, by Chris Cook</strong> </h2> <p>You surely can't have missed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/14/felix-baumgartner-lands-safely-record\" title=\"\">the extraordinary performance on Sunday by Felix Baumgartner</a>, a man who is presumably so starved of interesting moments in his life that he had to ascend to the edge of space and jump back towards Earth, just to feel a bit of a thrill. Good lord, man, wouldn't it have been simpler to stick your last \u00a320 on an odds-on shot at Cartmel?</p> <p>Just so we're clear, I'm not advocating that last course of action, which would definitely not count as sensible or responsible gambling. But then nor would I advocate launching yourself into fresh air from a height of 24 miles. Well done for landing safely, Felix. Now have a sit down over there and see if you can concentrate on the Salisbury form.</p> <p>It's heavy going down Stonehenge way today, considerably more testing than when <strong>Les Verguettes (3.25)</strong> won at Leicester last week. But she gets to run off the same mark, that having been an apprentice race, and her profile on turf is progressive. The 9-4 is something less than generous, alas.</p> <p><strong>Stagweekend (2.10)</strong> showed in a maiden at Newcastle last week that he can cope well with testing conditions and, although he didn't win, he was 10 lengths clear of the third. The form of his first run, when he was sixth, has also worked out fairly well and he gets his best chance yet at Musselburgh today, where the going is mostly soft. He's 4-1. The William Haggas-trained favourite has raced only on a fast surface.</p> <p>I'm surprised you can get 11-2 about <strong>Marco Botti's Cheektocheek (2.30)</strong> in the Windsor nursery. Terribly green on his debut at Yarmouth, he nonetheless finished strongly to win.</p> <p>He ran fairly well in a nursery at Wolverhampton but the tight turns and lack of early pace would not have suited. From the same mark today, he can score again.</p> <h2><strong>Tipping competition</strong> \u2013 a new week </h2> <p>Congratulations to <strong>CheekyGol</strong>, who had a winnerless Friday but still held on to win last week's competition on a final score of +30.38.

Brown writes that social media is potentially <a href=\"http://www.blackdogtribe.com/people-like-you/guest-blog-social-media-bad-your-mental-health-mark\">one of the most liberating and useful things</a> that has ever happened to people with mental health difficulties, adding:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Prior to the internet, it had never really occurred to people that the great value of communications technology might be the ability to communicate with people you've never met before. I suppose it had happened in marginal ways, like the popularity of CB radio and phone ins on talk radio. In many ways, communications technology had been all about protecting us from communications with strangers and making sure that we only interacted with people we knew. Now we live in a world where it has never been so easy to get to know complete strangers and to build and make things alongside them.<br>... It always puzzles me that critics of social media seem to think that the opportunity to meet strangers online somehow detracts from the opportunity to meet people in real life. I meet people I've met online in real life all of the time. In fact some of the most rewarding relationships in my life have come from friendships with people that I've met online first.<br> For the first time ever, people with mental health difficulties are finding ways to connect with other people with mental health difficulties both across the country and across the world. On twitter I talk to people every day who are just getting on with life living with a mental health difficulty. None of us are celebrities. Most of us aren't journalists or broadcasters.

It also raised fresh questions about the state's ability to tackle militancy. Malala's life was saved by neurosurgeons in a Pakistani military hospital and she has since been in intensive care.</p> <p>Doctors have recommended she be transferred to a UK centre \"which has the capability to provide integrated care to children who have sustained severe injury\", a Pakistani military spokesman said. The flight left Rawalpindi on Monday morning. She is travelling with an army intensive care assistant on a specially equipped air ambulance leased from the UAE and will be treated in Birmingham at the Queen Elizabeth hospital, an NHS hospital with a specialist major trauma centre.</p> <p>The Pakistani government is bearing the costs of transportation and treatment. The UK foreign secretary, William Hague, said: \"Last week's barbaric attack on Malala Yousafzai and her schoolfriends shocked Pakistan and the world. Malala's bravery in standing up for the right of all young girls in Pakistan to an education is an example to us all.</p> <p>\"Malala will now receive specialist medical care in an NHS hospital. Our thoughts remain with Malala and he family at this difficult time.\"</p> <p>The Foreign Office said the move followed an offer by the UK government to assist Malala in any way that it could.</p> <p>Malala was shot in the head and neck while she sat with classmates on a school bus as it prepared to drive students home after morning classes in Mingora, a city in the Swat valley, where the army mounted major operations in 2009 to crush a Taliban insurgency. She had become famous after <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7834402.stm\" title=\"\">writing a blog in 2009 for the BBC Urdu service</a> about life under the Taliban insurgency.</p> <p>The Taliban issued a statement claiming it was obligatory to kill anyone \"leading a campaign\" against Islamic law, and warned it would again attempt to kill her if she recovered from her injuries.</p> <p>Police have arrested at least three suspects in connection with the attack but the two gunmen who carried out the shooting remain at large.</p> <p>The biggest rally yet showing solidarity with Malala was held in the southern city of Karachi on Sunday but the response to her shooting has been relatively low key in Pakistan compared with that to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/21/pakistan-asia-muslim-us-protests\" title=\"\">last month's demonstrations against a film produced in the US that denigrated the prophet Muhammad</a>. Government officials have condemned the attack but refrained from publicly criticising the Taliban by name over the attack, in what critics say demonstrates a lack of resolve against extremism.</p> <p>The former UK prime minister Gordon Brown, who is UN special envoy for global education, launched an <a href=\"http://www.educationenvoy.org\" title=\"\">\"I am Malala\" petition</a> on Monday. \"Today, sadly, 32 million girls are not going to school, and it is time to fight harder for Malala's dream to come true,\" said Brown. He said he would hand the petition to Asif Ali Zardari, when he visited the Pakistani president next month, and that it would also be given to the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon.</p>",

A new campaign group called <a href=\"http://www.energyroyd.org.uk/archives/tag/ban-the-burn\" title=\"\">Ban the Burn</a> has been founded in nearby Hebden Bridge, whose fortune was coincidentally made by corduroy mills, linking grouse moor heather treatment to this year's disastrous floods in the town.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GHfUVfEagJg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GHfUVfEagJg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\"You can see why Hebden Bridge is worried,\" says Melling, scrambling over a ditch like a small pond which protects a renovated shooters' track, bright and buttery-coloured with crushed limestone amid the dark sandstone of the area. \"Drainage carries off the moors and the becks can rise very quickly with sort of weather we've been having.\" Direct flooding connection remains unproven but Hebden's centre went under when Hebden Water rose by nearly a metre in four hours <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-18768291\" title=\"\">in July</a>.<br><br>The burn, promoting the growth of new heather in great swaths , is a traditional and lawful grouse-shooting measure. But others prompted action against Walshaw's owner, Richard Bannister, soon after he bought the moor in 2002 from Lord Savile whose family had had it for 150 years. The retail millionaire, who founded <a href=\"http://www.boundarymill.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Boundary Mill</a> stores in nearby Colne, had to pay \u00a333,500 in fines and costs three years later and restore moorland damaged by tracks and spoil.</p> <p>Natural England kept up the pressure when work restarted, but to consternation in the wildlife and landscape world, a second and much bigger legal action <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/mar/14/natural-england-peatland-bog-burning\" title=\"\">was dropped in March</a> and an associated public inquiry into a review of burning consents granted to Savile in 1994 also terminated. The RSPB says that the turnaround is at the heart of its European claim, with no clear or satisfactory explanation for such a complete change of view.</p> <p>Apart from flooding, the key trigger for possible European intervention is the moors' thick and shaggy coat of blanket bog, which looks increasingly mangy as drainage and burning take their toll. Its rich variety of vivid green sphagnum mosses is among the most heavily protected landscapes in the EU and increasingly significant as a natural carbon-capturer as well as acting as a flood-deterring sponge.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w6mKD-BvIaE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w6mKD-BvIaE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Standing by the currently well-behaved Hebden Water in the centre of Hebden Bridge, Dongria Kondh of Ban the Burn says: \"This isn't a remote controversy up on a hilltop where only a few people go. For the sake of all of us, we need to regenerate the blanket bog by stopping burning, blocking the grips (drainage ditches) and revegetating the sphagnum moss and cotton grass. We wholly support intervention by Europe.\"<br><br>Mike Clarke, chief executive of the RSPB, says: \"The decision to lodge this complaint has not been taken lightly but Natural England has dropped its prosecution without giving an adequate explanation or securing restoration of the damage. It has also entered into a new management agreement which we consider has fundamental flaws and is probably unlawful \u2013 and would do little if anything to realise the coalition government's ambition to restore biodiversity.\"</p> <p>Natural England defends the new agreement, <a href=\"http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/home_page_-_latest_news/walshawmoor2.aspx\" title=\"\">a 25-year framework which involves \u00a32.5m in public funding for the first decade</a>, as \"providing improved environmental protection for the oors and also allowing the estate to conduct its business activities\".</p> <p>The quango, which is coping with the loss of one-fifth of its budget over four years in the spending cuts, <a href=\"http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/Images/Walshaw_Notice_and_Consent_tcm6-31089.pdf\" title=\"\">says that</a> crucially the plan ends a very wide range of freedoms given to Savile in 1994. \"For the first time, burning activities on the Walshaw Estate will be subject to specific controls. The agreement sets restrictions on the maintenance and creation of infrastructure and an active programme of peat rewetting has also been agreed, so that blanket bog restoration can take place. We are aware that the RSPB has launched a complaint at the European commission and await the outcome before determining what the implications are \u2013 if any.\"</p> <p>Bannister, 51, who has six keepers and uses the moor for shooting parties of friends and business contacts without the usual eye-watering fees, defends his management as in the long tradition of grouse-shooting. He calls the moor his \"passion\" which he wants \"future generations to enjoy and share\" \u2013 the land has open access except on specific areas during shooting. He is <a href=\"http://www.moorlandassociation.org/newsshow.asp?art=138\" title=\"\">also strongly supported by the Moorland Association</a>, the campaign group for moor owners, which sees Walshaw Moor as a test case for blanket bog on about a third of England's 303,500 hectares (750,000 acres) of grouse moor.</p> <p>The controversy also threatens to add to the troubles of the coalition, with campaigners wary of the Conservative wildlife minister, Richard Benyon, a major landowner <a href=\"http://markavery.info/tag/richard-benyon/\" title=\"\">whose hobbies include shooting alongside conservation</a>.

  "<p>One of the joys of Rupert Murdoch having joined Twitter is that we're able to glimpse the real Rupert and the reason he was nicknamed the Dirty Digger.</p> <p>In the light of his describing hacking victims as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/oct/14/rupert-murdoch-phone-hacking-scumbags\">scumbag celebrities</a> it's as well to remind us of the day he appeared before MPs to say: \"This is the most humbling day of my life.\" </p> <p>So it's fair to ask: was his apology for the illegal and unethical actions of his News of the World journalists sincere after all?</p> <p>I suppose he could have been shooting from the hip (or the lip), not realising that these \"scumbags\" had suffered outrageously from intrusion into their private lives.</p> <p>But my guess is that once that fact is pointed out he wouldn't give a damn, even if he was prevailed upon to issue an anodyne, and utterly insincere, apology at some stage.</p> <p>In truth, his tweet was a revelation of the ruthless and unrepentant Murdoch, the man who spent 30 years either excusing News of the World excesses or simply ignoring them.</p> <p>After all, in spite of all that its reporters and executives had done, he has admitted to being panicked into closing the paper. </p> <p>Consider his breathtaking cynicism. Murdoch's company, News Corporation, lives off celebrities. They star in 20th Century Fox movies and they appear on Fox TV. He mixes with them.</p> <p>Meanwhile, his popular newspapers feed off them in a different way, using them as sales fodder. It matters not to him how they are portrayed, nor how articles about them are obtained. Now we know why. He thinks they are scumbags.</p> <p>Well, humble man, I guess it takes one to know one. Good luck with the News Corp AGM when scumbag investors ask pertinent questions about your company and then vote against you and your board.</p> <p>Not that it will unseat you of course. You have the voting shares tied up. It's great to live in a free market when it's tilted in one's favour, isn't it?</p> <p>But this kind of insult could yet rebound. We're all scumbags now.

  "<p>Terrorists, traffickers, and child abductors can only welcome Tory efforts to abolish the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/28/david-cameron-nick-clegg-european-arrest-warrant\" title=\"\">European arrest warrant</a> (EAW) and decrease, rather than step up, EU justice and police co-operation.</p> <p>If she had been home secretary a decade ago, Theresa May's moves to abolish the warrant would have meant that one of the July 2005 terrorists, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jun/11/uksecurity\" title=\"\">Hussain Osmain</a>, could still be in Rome, protected by lawyers and legal trickery. Instead, he is now in prison after being returned to face justice \u2013 under the EAW. A withdrawal from the EAW, as a result of the Conservative obsession to limit Britain's partnership and co-operation in the EU, would be welcomed by all transnational criminals who flee British justice and rely on other countries' legal systems to delay the return of any fugitive to British justice.</p> <p>Other measures to promote justice and co-operation against criminals who pay no attention to European frontiers are also being thrown out of the window as May enters the cabinet \"EU exit competition\" \u2013 apparently to see which minister can parade his or her dislike of the EU the most.</p> <p>The following scenario looks likely: co-operation on sharing databases and research, and EU funding for crime-fighting initiatives, will all go out the window. Joint work to control immigration will be abolished. The Brits who currently head Europol and Eurojust \u2013 two useful co-ordinating bodies where Britain needs a voice \u2013 will now have to resign. Britain will now have to negotiate one by one with each EU member state on bilateral policies on crime fighting or immigration control.</p> <p>As Tory MEP Timothy Kirkhope points out, the rest of Europe will see the British decision as just another victory for Ukip, Tory MPs who want to quit the EU and offshore-owned press with its Europhobic pathologies.</p> <p>Instead, Britain should be in there arguing for improvement and reform. There are problems with the implementation of the EAW and it may need amending so is only covers more serious crimes with longer penalties than at present. But given the long delays in bringing some criminals to justice in the UK or the failure to secure rape convictions, Britain is in no position to boast that British judicial procedures are perfect.</p> <p>May could well argue that Britain can keep using the warrant. But that assumes the other 26 EU member states will allow Britain to cherrypick which bits of EU crime-fighting Tory ministers like. And in any case, the EAW has come under sustained fire from Tory MPs, headed by Dominic Raab, who say it allows British citizens to be extradited unfairly and costs Britain millions to administer.</p> <p>May's announcement is driven by dislike of Europe, more than a rational analysis of the balance of advantage to Britain in combating trafficking and other cross-border crime. It is unclear why other EU member states who have to accept the whole EU crime and justice package will be willing to allow Britain to pick and choose different parts of it.</p> <p>The European public prosecutor, which is proposed under this scheme, would prosecute European-level financial crime, counterfeiting and fraud but do so in relevant national courts. Opting out of this will please those fraudsters who have given the City a bad name, but it is hard to see why Britain should oppose European-level investigation and prosecution of financial crime.</p> <p>For comparison, Norway co-operates with the EAW \u2013 just as Norway implements more EU directives than Britain. Given that Tory Eurosceptics claim they want a Norwegian status for Britain in terms of detaching ourselves from the EU, they do not seem to realise that both Norway and Switzerland are in the Schengen area and abide by most EU rules.</p> <p>Before the EAW, Britain protected for 10 years <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachid_Ramda\" title=\"\">Rachid Ramda</a>, the Islamist terrorist who was the mastermind behind the 1995 Paris metro bombings which killed eight and wounded 80 in a pre-echo of 7/7 in London. Ramda was arrested in London on the basis of very clear evidence from the French police. But without an EAW he was able \u2013 with the help of lawyers and judges as well as Liberty and the Home Office \u2013 to stay in London for 10 years. Finally, Charles Clarke, who was home secretary after 7/7 changed attitudes, sent him back in 2005 to face justice and the victims of his killings. He is now serving life in a French prison.</p>",
  "<p>Successive governments have started to grasp what we in Greater Manchester, and our colleagues in England's other core cities, have been arguing forcibly for some time: cities are crucial engines of economic growth with the capacity to help rebalance the nation's economy by acting as a counterweight to London and the south east.</p> <p>We have long maintained that many of the issues which shape the success of our area including transport, housing, economic development, skills and job creation, are best addressed at a city regional level. Only by assuming greater freedoms and powers devolved from Whitehall can we begin to realise the full potential of our great cities.</p> <p>It's fair to say that devolution, localism - call it what you will - is an idea whose time has come. In Greater Manchester, we welcomed the current government's appointment of a minister for cities and its increasing recognition of the role of cities.</p> <p>Because of the mature and long-standing collaborative relationship between the <a href=\"http://www.agma.gov.uk/gmca/index.html\" title=\"\">ten Greater Manchester authorities</a> - transcending political differences to focus on economic priorities - we were well positioned to respond to this new climate.</p> <p>The establishment in April 2011 of the <a href=\"http://www.agma.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Greater Manchester Combined Authority,</a> the first of its kind in the country, took this co-operation to a new level and put it on a statutory footing. Working alongside other Greater Manchester-wide bodies such as<a href=\"http://www.tfgm.com/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\"> Transport for Greater Manchester</a> and the<a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/economic-development/leps\" title=\"\"> Local Enterprise Partnership,</a> we have much greater scope to plan for growth.</p> <p>Speaking with a single, clear voice means we can be more persuasive in our conversations with external decision-makers and stakeholders.</p> <p>Working in a co-ordinated fashion means we can be not only strategic but also, crucially I believe, imaginative - coming up with new ways of doing things which challenge orthodox thinking.</p> <p>One fundamental theme of what we are setting out to achieve, which points to the future in times of dwindling public resources, is greater self-sufficiency.</p> <p>What I mean by this is epitomised by the <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/2110432\" title=\"\">Earnback model in the City Deal </a>which Greater Manchester agreed with central government earlier this year.</p> <p>Back in 2009 we set up the <a href=\"http://www.gmpf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Greater Manchester Fund.</a> This involved the ten local authorities investing the equivalent of \u00a31.2bn. This investment was tightly focused on the projects, including the expansion of our Metrolink light rail system, which we agreed reflected the region's priorities and would generate the best economic returns, ultimately for national government as well as the area.</p> <p>The Earnback model, a sign of confidence in Greater Manchester, is a 30 year deal which will enable us to recoup from government up to \u00a330m a year from increased business rates which can then be reinvested in transport infrastructure.</p> <p>This sort of recycling of the funds generated by success is also central to the <a href=\"http://www.gmcvo.org.uk/node/2196\" title=\"\">Evergreen Fund,</a> an investment vehicle which will soon become operational involving 19 local authorities, with the Greater Manchester authorities taking a lead role.</p> <p>It will be focused on providing loan funding for the projects which will deliver the greatest economic benefits for the region and underpin its growth. The financial return from these projects will be recycled to keep the fund going.</p> <p>Our asks for the future include further steps towards self-sufficiency. Manchester City Council has backed various calls by the City Finance Commission to allow councils to retain a greater share of business rates generated from new commercial projects.</p> <p>This would enable the areas where progressive local government, and strong business-led partnership structures, help stimulate growth to benefit more directly from it and reinvest for future success.</p> <p>So, one crucial theme of our thinking is the creation of a virtuous circle where cities are incentivised for success and enabled to build on the momentum created.</p> <p>Another is the pooling of resources across Greater Manchester, using a clear investment framework to prioritise economic growth \u2013 bringing together different funding streams in a single pot. This approach, already used in the Greater Manchester transport fund, will be used more widely.</p> <p>Of course the whole point of bespoke arrangements between city regions and central government such as the City Deals is that everywhere is different and imposing a one size fits all solution does not work.</p> <p>I do not presume that the Greater Manchester experience is one which could, or even should, be replicated everywhere. But there is an incredible amount that can be achieved at a more local level if local government is given greater freedoms from Whitehall control and financial dependency on the centre. This in turn relies on the innovation, vision and determination of cities to drive it forward. Only demonstrable success will maintain the current devolutionary direction. In Greater Manchester we believe that we have not just a vision for growth but, increasingly, access to the tools to deliver it.</p> <p><em>Sir Howard Bernstein is chief executive of Manchester city council </em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The shire counties are home to nearly half of England's population and have experienced the highest levels of growth in England over the past decade.&#xa0;</p> <p>Devolving and supporting greater governance across these areas and mirroring the focus and investment that has gone into the cities has the potential to make real contributions to improving England's economic prospects. With growth proving elusive, it is vital that the government should look beyond the major cities and recognise the potential to make a similar, if not greater contribution to transforming the fortunes of the nation.</p> <p>Over the past decade, Cornwall has shown that it can grow at a faster rate compared with other areas of the UK. European funding has played a big part in developments over this time, but support from the local public sector and particularly the private sector have been critical in this achieving this level of growth. The other elements have been aspiration, leadership and partnership. As a result, Cornwall's economic growth has surpassed expectation \u2013 achieving a GDP per capita increase of some 8% in the past 10 years.&#xa0;This level of growth has been bettered only by the city of London.&#xa0;</p> <p>Like many counties, we still have some way to go to transform our fortunes completely, but our dependency on funding from Whitehall makes us far too vulnerable to reductions in grant from the government. Radical change is required.</p> <p>In Cornwall, we have done better than most because we anticipated the initial reductions and dealt with them head-on, but repeating that trick again will not be enough. With challenges come opportunities, however, and we are calling on the coalition government to demonstrate its commitment to localism and devolution by granting Cornwall the chance to negotiate a bespoke <a href=\"http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Cornwall-Deal-devolved-power-county/story-16744876-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">\"county deal\"</a> that would allow us the chance to fulfil our potential and ambition without any new money.</p> <p>If you accept the view that the status quo for the operation of local government isn't an option but radical reform is negotiated rather than imposed, the idea of a \"county deal\" would provide an exciting opportunity for a number of areas to test new models of governance, organisational delivery and even funding mechanisms.</p> <p>The idea of shire counties operating as small but perfectly formed state governments may sound fanciful on first reading, but in reality the roll-out of initiatives such as \"whole place\" public sector budgets are providing further stimulus to explore radical changes in governance that go beyond the current debate between mayoral, cabinet and committee models.</p> <p>There are numerous examples beyond our shores that already point to how the public sector could work far more effectively to solve the unprecedented challenges that we currently face, but we need to confront the issue of organisational sovereignty in order to overcome these challenges.</p> <p>The decision to create a unitary council in Cornwall in 2009, although unpopular in some quarters at the time and fuelled by the fear of change, enabled the council to absorb a 30% reduction in funding without impacting on frontline services. Where appropriate, we have transferred the operation of services to our wholly owned companies or to external organisations such as charitable trusts \u2013 this has enabled them to focus on service delivery and, in some cases trade, reducing the scale of budget reductions that the council faced.</p> <p>More recently the introduction of a single Clinical Commissioning Group, the Local Enterprise Partnership and a Voluntary Sector Board, all with co-terminus boundaries, has provided a golden opportunity to go much further and either align and even bind the public, private and voluntary sector together in Cornwall. We are increasingly working hand in hand with local people and other stakeholders on understanding the needs of customers, developing a single vision for Cornwall and jointly determining budget priorities to deliver our collective ambition.</p> <p>Add to the mix the soon to be elected police and crime commissioners and the argument for transferring additional powers and freedoms to the shires as part of \"county deals\" becomes even more attractive. I am convinced that greater independence from the centre, coupled with further alignment of public sector, and where appropriate the involvement of the private sector, is the only way in which the country will move from austerity to prosperity.</p> <p>There are numerous examples of local authorities leading the way in developing innovative new approaches to public service delivery and generating economic growth. Places like Cornwall are both confident and capable of doing so much more, but, having pushed the envelope, there are legislative and bureaucratic barriers that are stymieing our progress.</p> <p>Take European funding as an example, we know that development works best when it is locally delivered and designed but we are constrained by a number of our ring-fenced funding streams being managed outside Cornwall. By truly embracing the principle of localism and freeing places like Cornwall from central control the Government will empower councils and communities to take responsibility for their own economic future. Only this way can we unlock their innovative capacity, local knowledge and experience to ensure a smart, sustainable and fully inclusive economy fit for the challenges of the 21st century.</p> <p>I am convinced that a new blueprint for the delivery of public sector services and economic growth can emerge from the counties, but our potential will truly be realised only if government looks beyond the major cities.</p> <p><em>Kevin Lavery is the chief executive of Cornwall council</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

The other two categories are sustainable economic opportunity and human development.</p> <p>Nigeria was singled out as the worst performer of the four, dropping into the bottom 10 countries in the overall rankings for the first time. The country was ranked 14th out of the 16 countries in west Africa and 43rd out of the 52 countries listed overall. Nigeria was 41st last year and 37th in 2006.</p> <p>Although South Africa, Egypt and Kenya are ranked fifth, 14th and 25th respectively, people's freedom to participate in political processes has declined in each country. Kenya and South Africa have also registered a decline in economic opportunities, while Egypt has shown a significant improvement in this area.</p> <p>\"Given the vast natural and human resources of these four regional powers, these governance results are a concern,\" said Abdoulie Janneh, a board member of the <a href=\"http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Mo Ibrahim Foundation</a>, which has published the index since 2007. \"Each of these countries plays a key role in the economic and political landscape of the continent. To continue to optimally play this role requires a sustained commitment to balanced and equitable governance.\"</p> <p>This year's index examines data from each of the four categories, which are broken down into 14 sub-categories, for each country between 2000 and 2011. It uses 88 indicators drawn from 23 independent data providers from Africa and internationally.</p> <p>Mauritius came top in the overall index, followed by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/oct/10/pedro-pires-african-leadership-prize\" title=\"\">Cape Verde</a>, Botswana and the Seychelles, continuing the same pattern as last year. Somalia was last, a position it has occupied since the index was first published. The country came last in each of the four category rankings. Somalia's overall score has declined since 2006. Tanzania moved into the top 10 for the first time this year, while Liberia, Sierra Leone and Angola registered significant improvements. Sudan and South Sudan were not included this year.</p> <p>Speaking ahead of the index launch, the Sudanese-born philanthropist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/mo-ibrahim\" title=\"\">Mo Ibrahim</a> told the Guardian that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/video/2012/oct/15/mo-ibrahim-rwanda-african-governance-video\" title=\"\">economic success cannot be allowed to overshadow human rights and democratic processes in Africa</a> (video), a continent that has seen steady economic growth over the past 10 years, even during the \"dark days of the financial crisis\". \"What we need in Africa is balanced development. Economic success cannot be a replacement for human rights or participation, or democracy \u2026 it doesn't work,\" he said. \"It worries us a lot when we don't see the trickle-through factor, when gain goes to the top 1% or 2%, leaving the rest behind.\"</p> <p>North Africa is an obvious example of the consequences of ignoring people's needs and rights, he added. \"Literacy in Tunisia is almost 100%. It's amazing \u2013 no country in the region or even in Asia can match Tunisia in education. So we have wonderful human development achievement in education and health, etc. But hundreds of thousands of men and women who graduated from college cannot find work, and not only that but [they] look around and they see an oppressive, corrupt regime. Then you have a volatile mix.\"</p> <p>Rwanda, which has risen two places in the overall ranking, to 23rd this year, is also an example of unbalanced development. Although the country ranks 16th and 11th for human development and sustainable economic opportunities respectively, up from 13th and 17th in 2011, it is 31st for safety and rule of law, down one place from last year and continuing a downward trend since 2006, and 29th for human rights and participation, although this is a rise of one place since last year. Last month, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/27/eu-partially-freezes-aid-to-rwanda\" title=\"\">the EU partially froze aid to Rwanda</a> over its alleged support of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/03/drc-m23-rebels-rwanda\" title=\"\">M23 rebel fighters</a> in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, following <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/01/rwanda-drc-why-washington-lost-patience\" title=\"\">the US</a>, Germany and the Netherlands. The UK had earlier suspended budget support over concerns about the country's human rights record. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/sep/06/britain-resumes-aid-to-rwanda\" title=\"\">Britain has since unblocked a portion of this money</a>.</p> <p>Ibrahim said the governments in Kigali and Kinshasa need to be encouraged by their donors and \"friends\" to sit down and talk to solve the crisis. \"I really think Rwanda is not just part of the problem but part of the solution, and what we hope is for the different parties to sit together \u2026 and have constructive discussions,\" he said.</p> <p>Overall, since 2000, governance in Africa has improved. Particular progress has been made in women's rights, said Ibrahim, although he acknowledged there was still a long way to go before gender equality is achieved. \"We're very pleased. This is an area [in which] we're moving forward, but we're coming from a very low base,\" he said. It's easy to introduce new legislation against domestic violence or give women rights over land and in divorce cases, but it's much more difficult to change attitudes and the culture of \"male supremacy\", he said. \"Education helps and the spread of information helps, and courageous, unflinching, uncompromising \u2026 political leadership is also required.\"</p> <p>For the third time, the Mo Ibrahim Foundation decided not to award any one <a href=\"http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/ibrahim-prize/\" title=\"\">the prize for African leadership</a> this year, as no one matched the judges' criteria.</p> <p>The prize recognises and celebrates excellence in African leadership, and provides winners with the opportunity to pursue their commitment to Africa once they have stepped down from office. It is awarded to a democratically elected former African head of state or government.</p> <p>The prize committee said: \"[We] reviewed a number of eligible candidates but none met the criteria needed to win this award. The award is about excellence in leadership. In the first six years the prize committee has selected three very worthy laureates who continue to be an inspiration and whose examples, we hope, will be emulated.\"</p>",
  "<p>This week's poem is by Oli Hazzard, whose first collection, <a href=\"http://www.carcanet.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?product=9781847771391\" title=\"\">Between the Windows</a> has recently been published by Carcanet Press.</p> <p>Hazzard's work is intriguing \u2013 playful and formally ingenious while engaged with serious philosophical questions. I've chosen \"Pantoum in Which Wallace Stevens Gives Me Vertigo\" for these qualities, and because it expresses without piety the delight of making meanings and experiences out of language. Its arc takes us from humorous exaggeration and implied argument with Stevens to homage. There's no doubt that Hazzard is able to write poetry which makes something happen in language, and in the reader's mind.</p> <p>The source of the speaker's disorientation, as we're told immediately, is Wallace Stevens's \"The Public Square.\" It's a brilliant small poem which packs immensities into its terse quatrains. Regrettably, it's still in copyright but <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Public_Square&amp;oldid=450903772\" title=\"\">you can read it here</a>.</p> <p>Hazzard borrows the following lines \u2013 \"A languid janitor bears/ His lantern through colonnades/ And the architecture swoons\" \u2013 making one-and-a-half lines of Stevens's three: \"a languid janitor bears his lantern through colonnades/ and the architecture swoons\u2026 \". The verb \"swoons\", suggesting both faintness and ecstasy, leads to a new thought, and a less pleasant sensation: \"I cannot read this poem/ without being struck down with vertigo.\"</p> <p>The form Hazzard has chosen, <a href=\"http://www.newpoetspress.com/pantoum.html\" title=\"\">the pantoum</a> is strangely apt for a conversation with Stevens's poem. The latter is not, of course, a pantoum, but it employs some potent repetition, and has a dominant imagery of falling buildings. Hazzard's poem centres on the fear of falling down and uses a structure that would seem to guard against collapse.</p> <p>The pantoum is an ultimately circular form, but, more importantly, its entire structure suggests a hesitant sort of progress. The repetition, in each stanza, of the previous stanza's second and fourth lines as first and third, gives the effect of retracing steps in an uncertain, slightly staggering gait \u2013 the way you might walk if you were feeling dizzy, or if you were navigating between obstacles.</p> <p>\"I can remind myself that it's only a poem, I'm not going to fall over/ whilst strapped into my chair\" is reassurance for both readers and writers. Formal structures make us feel safe as writers: analytical tools, similarly, control and sometimes over-control the thrilling weightlessness of discovering a poem. Hazzard's literal scenario amusingly dramatises the risk. But the images associated with persons strapped into chairs are various, and some are distinctly disturbing.</p> <p>The form is flexible enough to allow the repeated lines to change their syntactical position and punctuation. These shifts increase the effect of destabilisation. Many of the lines are enjambed rather than end-stopped, and embedded in a larger grammatical unit. But the syntax flows easily and cleanly. The idiom remains colloquial and the tone is gently, if knowingly, self-mocking.</p> <p>The writer's agility produces some logical back-flips, and the substitution of one meaning with its opposite. So, at the end of stanza three, there's a qualification concerning \"making it to the end\" of the poem, when the speaker protests, \"But this is not my ultimate goal\". In the next stanza the assertion is adroitly denied: \"'But this is not my ultimate goal,'/ I say \u2013 as if that were anything like the truth.\"</p> <p>Other subtle variations are brought into play. \"Fall over\" slides deftly into \"fall over/ myself\". \"Every day I celebrate// myself, because of one little achievement. (I don't really!)\" loses the intensifier \"just\" which it first had (stanza 4, line 2) and, now in parenthesis, \"I don't really!\" become a comic aside. We probably shouln't believe it, though, because the form insists on a return to Stevens (stanza one, line three), \"and the architecture swoons.\"</p> <p>The last stanza assembles a larger focus, and a new ambiguity: \"I cannot read this poem, / I say, as if it were anything like the truth.\" Is the speaker denying the truth of the statement that he cannot read this poem, or is he saying that the poem cannot be read \"as if it were anything like the truth\"? The latter seems likely, because of the change from \"that\" (stanza four, line four) to \"it\". Perhaps this raises the question as to whether any poem should be read \"as if it were anything like the truth\".</p> <p>By claiming that the original poem caused the speaker such an extreme physical reaction that he needed to be strapped into a chair, Hazzard's speaker has had fun with the idea that a poem is the same kind of event as lived experience. Yet the exaggeration serves to remind us that \"The Public Square\" (and poems like it) may still act powerfully on a reader's perceptions. In the end, the teasing stops: the vertigo is banished, and with it, perhaps, a certain \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/11/01/specials/bloom-influence.html\" title=\"\">anxiety of influence</a>\". The pantoum ends with a generous act of faith as it returns to its point of departure: a poem by Wallace Stevens. \"Every day I celebrate/ Wallace Stevens' poem 'The Public Square'\" seems less an exaggeration than a fact about living as a poet or reader of poetry, in that state of imaginative engagement.</p> <p><strong>Pantoum in Which Wallace Stevens Gives Me Vertigo</strong></p> <p>In Wallace Stevens' poem 'The Public Square',<br>a languid janitor bears his lantern through colonnades<br>and the architecture swoons. I cannot read this poem<br>without being struck down with vertigo. I can only read:</p> <p>'A languid janitor bears his lantern through colonnades\u2026'<br>before I start to feel sick, and suddenly aware of the earth's roundness.<br>Without being struck down with vertigo, I can only read<br>whilst strapped into my chair; I will read the poem, and</p> <p>before I start to feel sick, and suddenly aware of the earth's roundness,<br>I can remind myself that it's only a poem, I'm not going to fall over<br>whilst strapped into my chair. I will read the poem, and<br>triumph by making it to the end. But this is not my ultimate goal.</p> <p>I can remind myself that it's only a poem. I'm not going to fall over<br>myself just because of one little achievement. I don't really<br>triumph by making it to the end. 'But this is not my ultimate goal,'<br>I say \u2013 as if that were anything like the truth. Every day I celebrate</p> <p>myself because of one little achievement (I don't really!)<br>and the architecture swoons. I cannot read this poem,<br>I say, as if it were anything like the truth. Every day I celebrate<br>Wallace Stevens' poem 'The Public Square.'</p>",

  "<p>Last week we learned that the council tax freeze is to be extended for another year, a tacit admission by government that the tax system does not work in its current form.</p> <p>The freeze was initially meant to last during 2011 and 2012, with government providing a grant worth a 2.5% rise in council tax to any local council that chose not to implement a raise. Now it has been extended for a third year and there is no reason to imagine it will not be extended further.</p> <p>The financial problem councils face is that inflation has run higher than 2.5% for most of 2010-12. Worse still, the grants are not cumulative, so the council tax base is eroded. In terms of democracy, it has led to a heavily centralised system of control complemented by the capping of council tax at around 3.5%.</p> <p>The system is a largely watered down version of the poll tax, combining the property element of the old rates system with the principle of more individual charging and payment. However, council tax valuations haven't been updated in England since 1993 (they were revised in Wales in 2002) and governments are <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11401602\" title=\"\">reluctant to undertake revaluation</a> for fear of a substantial rise in tax which would have a significant impact at the polls. Ironically, this discrepancy was also a problem for the previous domestic rates system.</p> <p>The system also enables <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/mar/09/council-tax-in-it-together-anomalies\" title=\"\">the bizarre situation</a> where Westminster council charges the most valuable properties (Band H) \u00a31,375 in council tax, but Newark charges \u00a31,311 for a terraced house (Band B). Reforms to council tax benefit, which mean that authorities will be able to set the criteria for giving unemployed people money to cover their bill, are likely to exacerbate this problem.</p> <p>So is there an alternative? Both the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP) support a local income tax, through which a percentage of centrally raised income taxes (usually between 3% and 4.5%) would be given directly to local councils. The 2007-2011 SNP government attempted to introduce such a scheme in Scotland, but <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish_government_ditches_controversial_local_income_tax_plans_1_828842\" title=\"\">parties were unable to come to an agreement</a> on how to implement it. Moreover, under the devolution settlement, the level of tax <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/sep/06/scotland.counciltax\" title=\"\">would have been set by the Scottish government</a>.</p> <p>Local income taxes are already used in US cities such as <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/dof/html/services/business_tax_nys_income.shtml\" title=\"\">New York</a> and Philadelphia. In New York, around a 3% tax on the income of residents is paid directly to the city. This solves the issue of tax levels, and therefore revenues, being set centrally. The problem with this model is that as cities, such as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/world-us-canada-15782072\" title=\"\">Detroit</a>, fall into recession or decline tax revenues plummet and local government faces a financial crisis.</p> <p>A land value tax is used in the land-starved area of Hong Kong, as well as parts of Australia and the US. This levies tax against the value of land owned and in the UK is supported by the Green party, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the Institute of Fiscal Studies and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Scottish Green Party has published <a href=\"scot.gr/w/LVTplans.pdf\" title=\"\">detailed plans to tax land</a> according to use and value, with empty urban vacant land hit for 10% of its value. This means certain types of land use, for example forestry, could be encouraged and land used more efficiently.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.compassonline.org.uk%2Fuploads%2Fdocuments%2FCTP2TheCaseForLandValueTaxationIainMcLean.doc&amp;ei=I8d6T6i2B4bc8AP726i1CA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGieoaQVgcR9Us-_9sZy-o6t00uiQ\" title=\"\">A report by left-leaning thinktank Compass</a> argued that land value taxes are well-suited to funding infrastructure as it raises property value. The study argues that the Jubilee line underground extension to Stratford in east London raised property values in the area by an estimated \u00a310bn.

  "<p>I remember looking for an internship in the careers guidance building of the University of East Anglia back in 2008. I was in my penultimate year at the university, studying environmental science and international development. I had no previous work experience, no idea about the value of my skills and no clue where to start looking for work.</p> <p>I decided to do an internship because I needed the chance to apply my skills in the workplace and sample working life for the first time. Looking back certain factors ensured the internship worked for me, so here are some of the insights I learned.</p> <p>Before you commit, it is really important to decide what you what to achieve from an internship so you choose the right one for you. I wanted an internship that would stand out on my CV and allow me to make new friends but would not interfere with my university studies. I chose the <a href=\"http://www.step.org.uk/\" title=\"\">STEP London Internship Programme</a> because they place candidates in paid internships for three months over the summer and organise events for their interns to meet each other and share experiences.</p> <p>I was placed with a construction company called <a href=\"http://www.lakehouse.uk.com/\" title=\"\">Lakehouse</a>, an industry I would never have considered looking into. The internship was really inspiring; my role involved taking control of a project. I had to carry out market research to identify new business opportunities within the company's business development team, gaining valuable experience and useful industry contacts.</p> <p>Many people highlight the disadvantages of internships where the interns aren't given challenging or interesting work. An internship should be a mutually beneficial arrangement, where you gain valuable experience and the employer uses your skills to benefit the company. When you are interviewed by a prospective employer, remember it is also your chance to iask them what they have to offer.</p> <p>I was looking for a career direction and to gain confidence in my abilities. My internship gave me the opportunity to try out an industry which I had not previously considered and broadened my horizons. It prepared me for the working environment, which some of my friends have struggled with having gone straight into work from university, enhanced my CV and helped me negotiate future jobs. When the recession was at its worst and I found myself unemployed, having those contacts helped me to find work again.</p> <p>Not everyone has a good experience of internships. However, if you know what you want to achieve from doing one, this will help you to challenge yourself and the employer to make sure you have a worthwhile experience.</p> <p><em>Kate Pierpoint is the director of </em><a href=\"http://www.locallabourhire.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Local Labour Hire CIC</em></a><em> and social enterprise manager of </em><a href=\"http://www.mhdt.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Manor House Development Trust</em></a><em>.

  "<p>Virgin will continue to run the west coast mainline for at least nine months after it was handed a temporary extension to its franchise, as the transport secretary attempts to resolve a legally fraught saga that has thrown rail policy into chaos.</p> <p>Patrick McLoughlin will make an announcement later on Monday to the House of Commons with more details of what went wrong in a fiasco that saw the lucrative London-Manchester-Glasgow service awarded to FirstGroup before a judicial review sought by Virgin stopped the contracts being signed.</p> <p>The arrangement, which is expected to see Virgin remain in control for between nine and 13 months, will, McLoughlin hopes, deflect both any further legal action and calls for renationalisation. The alternative \u2013 asking the government-owned Directly Operated Railways (DOR) to run the route \u2013 would have seen both the major north-south arteries in state hands.</p> <p>During that extension a new, short franchise competition will be held \u2013 open to any bidder \u2013 to cover a subsequent interim period during which the long-term future of the line is decided. The government said it believed its solution was the best way to ensure services were maintained and that there was no impact on passengers.</p> <p>McLoughlin said: \"The cancellation of the InterCity West Coast (ICWC) franchise is deeply regrettable and I apologise to the bidders involved and the taxpayer who have a right to expect better.</p> <p>\"My priority now is to fix the problem and the first step is to take urgent action to ensure that on the 9 December services continue to run to the same standard and passengers are not affected.</p> <p>\"I believe Virgin remaining as operator for a short period of time is the best way to do this and my officials and I will be working flat out to make this happen.\"</p> <p>On 3 October the previous franchise competition was cancelled after the Department for Transport (DfT) uncovered \"significant technical flaws\" while preparing to defend the action in court.</p> <p>It also paused the franchise programme, including live competitions on Essex Thameside, Great Western and Thameslink, and set up two independent reviews into what went wrong with the west coast competition and the wider DfT rail franchise programme.</p> <p>The arrangement appears to put Virgin in pole position for any short franchise competition. Senior industry sources said that it seemed a \"foregone conclusion\" that the incumbent would stay in place until a long-term handover.</p> <p>However, analysts suggest that there may be implications from the decision for the other paused franchise competitions \u2013 possibly seeing the services passed, at least temporarily, into state hands.</p> <p>Gerald Khoo of Espirito Santo said: \"We believe this decision has been driven by concerns at the DfT that it may not be legal to extend a rail franchise agreement more than once. Great Western and Essex Thameside have both already been extended. Therefore, we would view these franchises as being at risk of either being transferred to DOR or being the subject of competitive tenders for any short-term extension (challenging in the time available, but not impossible).\"</p> <p>In a statement, FirstGroup which had entered into a bitter war of words with Virgin after the process was derailed in late August, merely affirmed its commitment to keeping the railways in the private sector.</p> <p>It said: \"We believe the private sector provides the most effective and efficient way to deliver passenger rail services in the UK. We await the outcome of the independent investigations into the ICWC franchise competition and the wider rail franchising process, which we hope will provide a greater degree of certainty and confidence not only to future bidders, but to employees, stakeholders and the travelling public too. \"</p> <p>Unions meanwhile denounced the arrangement as an \"ideological stitch up.\"</p> <p>The RMT general secretary, Bob Crow, said: \"This announcement is no surprise. The government are ideologically opposed to public ownership of the railways and, in collusion with the private train operators, have stitched up a shabby deal that will enable them to rerun the whole franchise fiasco in a years time.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Richard Branson and his shareholders are laughing all the way to the bank. Not only have they made hundreds of millions from the rail privatisation lottery but they have now scooped the rollover as well.\"</p>",
  "<p>How do you feel if I say the words \"energy performance certificate\"? What about \"London landlord accreditation scheme\"? Is your pulse racing? I didn't think so.</p> <p>The dry and cumbersome language of the private rented housing sector is not exactly the stuff of captivating media headlines. For those of us trying to shout from the rooftops about how bad things are for private tenants right now, this can present a problem.</p> <p>One organisation that has succeeded in capturing widespread attention is Shelter, with its simple and popular <a href=\"http://www.england.shelter.org.uk/campaigns/evict_rogue_landlords\" title=\"\">'evict rogue landlords' campaign</a>. The housing charity is encouraging residents to report dodgy landlords to their local authorities, who can take legal action if they are found to be operating outside the law. The message has gained traction. Across the public debate on welfare and housing, the concept of the \"rogue landlord\" has caught on fast. It is central to our understanding of what is wrong with the private rented sector.</p> <p>So if talk of 'rogue landlords' has helped to make the difficulties of life as a private tenant mainstream news, what's the issue? The problem is that Shelter's concept seduces us into believing the deep-rooted problems in the private rented sector can be eradicated by punishing a small, malignant minority when in fact large-scale policy overhaul is now urgently needed.</p> <p>There are plenty of fully legal landlords happy to bully their tenants, impose huge rent increases and end contracts on a whim. Some renters and their landlords have come to consider this acceptable behaviour, so a rogue is always someone else: someone a friend of a friend told you about, or that one you saw on the telly. Never the landlord you have \u2013 or the one you are.</p> <p>Of course unlawful evictions, harassment of tenants and illegal hazards need to be tackled. But I speak to private tenants across London every day and for most of them, current legislation offers them little or no protection against the problems they face.</p> <p>For those landlords who are operating illegally, local councils have a feeble track record at prosecuting them, as Shelter points out. What Shelter doesn't explain is how councils are supposed to find the time and resources to deal with the spiralling number of complaints from tenants, and at a time when funding for local authorities is being cut by central government.</p> <p>Councils are already overwhelmed by the sheer volume of complaints they receive and can often only hope to provide basic dispute resolution between landlord and tenant. For Shelter to suggest that we can prosecute our way out of this problem using current legislation is at best naive and at worst disingenuous.</p> <p>The figure of the rogue landlord as a modern-day folk devil might be media-friendly, but it is meaningless for the majority of private tenants. We need nuanced debate about the private rented sector, to reflect the diverse and complex experiences of tenants.</p> <p>Shelter does some excellent work getting housing issues into the mainstream press, but right now its analysis is being allowed to dominate the debate. Unlike council tenants, who have rich a tradition of self-organisation and representation, private tenants have no collective identity or voice.</p> <p>This is partly why we've found it so difficult to challenge unfair treatment. It's only now, as pressures on private tenants reach an apex that we're beginning to speak as one and forge this collective voice.

  "<p>Google will be told on Tuesday to unravel the controversial changes introduced in March to its European privacy policy, legal sources have told the Guardian.</p> <p>The French data protection commissioner, the CNIL, will be holding a press conference on Tuesday to announce the results of its deliberations together with the data protection chiefs of the other European Union countries.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/08/google-privacy-policy-data-protection\" title=\"\">exclusively revealed by the Guardian last week</a>, they have determined that Google's changes breached EU law because they did not give users any chance to opt out of the changes.</p> <p>Next, the CNIL \u2013 one of the more aggressive European data protection commissioners \u2013 will tell Google to undo those changes, and recreate the setup that existed before, said Chris Watson, a partner and privacy expert at the London law firm CMS Cameron McKenna.</p> <p>\"By putting the CNIL in charge of this, the EU was going for blood,\" said Watson. \"It was a declaration of intent.\"</p> <p>The UK's ICO, he suggested, would have taken a softer line with Google. \"The point is that Google is an international company which is leveraging its power in the browser and its other services in a way that affects national businesses all over the EU. There's great political importance in the data protection commissioners doing something, because if they think there's a breach and they don't do anything about it, what's the point of having them?\"</p> <p>Bradley Shears, a US-based lawyer who specialises in digital privacy law and has campaigned for increased privacy for users of services including Facebook, said he expects the CNIL to find that Google broke EU privacy law, and to oblige it to unwind the changes.</p> <p>Shears told the Guardian: \"Since Google had the technical capability to combine the data of all of its users' accounts it should have the ability to reinstate the previous barriers that acted like a digital Chinese wall between its services that better protected user privacy.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Since Google refused to heed the EU's prior warnings that changing its privacy policies may violate data protection laws it would not surprise me if restrictions are placed on how Google may utilise the user data profiles it has created since the new policies went into effect. This [EU] decision may restrict Google's ability to fully monetise its users' personal data across its platforms and may cost Google tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue.\"</p> <p>Shears noted that \"The EU's decision may create a domino effect and lead regulators in the US and other parts of the world to impose similar restrictions on Google's ability to intermingle and monetise user data.\" In the US, Google had to agree in October 2011 to privacy oversight by the Federal Trade Commission for 20 years <a href=\"http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2011/10/buzz.shtm\" title=\"\">after being accused of violating its own privacy policies and using \"deceptive practices\" in setting up its Buzz social network</a>.</p> <p>In the changes, trailed in January and then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/01/google-privacy-policy-changes-eu\" title=\"\">carried out in March</a>, Google brought together separate \"silos\" of data collected from services such as its search service, YouTube and Maps into a single datastore so that it could tailor adverts and content more closely.</p> <p>Google said then the new policy would simplify the user experience, and said it was confident it had obeyed \"all European data protection laws and principles\".</p> <p>But it was warned by the justice commissioner Viviane Reding that the changes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/01/eu-warns-google-over-privacy\" title=\"\">might breach EU law</a>.</p> <p>There have been suggestions that trying to separate the data back into individual services would be like \"unscrambling an egg\".</p> <p>Watson said that he believes that Google will in fact be able to do that: \"To suggest that they couldn't would be like Microsoft's defence when it was accused of using its Windows monopoly for the Internet Explorer browser \u2013 that it couldn't separate them. It could. If Google's defence is that they can't, they're going to have a fight on their hands.\"</p> <p>Google declined to comment on the forthcoming CNIL report, but said: \"We are confident that our privacy notices respect the requirements of European data protection laws.\"</p> <p>Separately, Google has been in intensive talks for months with the European Commission's competition arm. It is accused of anti-competitive behaviour in the way it orders its search results, uses other sites' content, and controls some elements of advertising.</p> <p>Reports last week said that Google has offered to \"label\" its own services where they appear in search results \u2013 though early reaction from affected companies suggested that would not be enough.</p>",

This experiment puts together a group of 35 people of all ages who've had treatment for cancer and gives them 12 weeks to rehearse for a performance at the Royal Albert Hall. The result is just lovely. Enthusiastic choir leader Cat Southall admits she has her work cut out with the quality of some of the singers at first, but by the time the Big C belt out Bon Jovi's It's My Life at the gig it really doesn't matter. Emeli Sand\u00e9 and Russell Watson are among their celebrity cheerleaders. <em>HV</em></p> <h2>Wonderland: Walking with Dogs<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>If you wanted to make a film in the capital about the emotional bond between dogs and their owners, you'd do worse than pitch up at Hampstead Heath \u2013 the biggest green space in London. In this funny, tough and affecting documentary, Vanessa Engle barks personal questions at assorted dog-walkers, who open up their lives to us; from the recovering alcoholic with a dog called Zen \u2013 \"because he lives in the now\" \u2013 to the woman who says of her dog, \"Luna finds anything: bras, money, anything \u2026\" Pause. \"Goats' heads.\" <em>AJC</em></p> <h2>Monroe<br>9pm, ITV1</h2> <p>Possessing maverick tendencies is no bad thing in a neurosurgeon. In fact, it's practically part of the job description. However, a failure of nerve is an entirely different matter, and a glum and moody-looking Monroe is in the grip of doubts following an operation that went catastrophically wrong. Can he snap out of it? Elsewhere, there's post-coital tension between Shepherd and Witney, and newly promoted Springer acts like an idiot. For all its occasional silliness, a medical drama that's a delicate scalpel cut above Holby City or Casualty. <em>JW</em></p> <h2>World War Two: 1942 and Hitler's Soft Underbelly<br>9pm, BBC4<br></h2> <p>Why does so much of Britain's campaigning history in the second world war revolve around north Africa and the much-storied Desert Rats? Professor David Reynolds argues that Churchill's preoccupation with the region had much to do with preserving the arteries of empire, as well as avoiding the sort of direct conflict with the Germans suffered by the Russians that would have led to a politically unpopular bloodbath reminiscent of the Great War. Compelling stuff, marred only by Reynolds's bad imitations of Roosevelt in the narrative. <em>DS</em></p> <h2>Sex, Death and the Meaning <br>of Life<br>10pm, More 4<br></h2> <p>Debut of a new series in which Richard Dawkins undertakes a sort of imaginary tour of his ideal world \u2013 one in which humanity has forsaken the worship of unanswerable gods who don't seem to like us much, and committed itself to building a world founded entirely on reason. Dawkins confronts the common \u2013 and altogether wrongheaded \u2013 belief that without religion there can be no morality, asking whether science can indeed provide a basis for an ethical life. The first instalment of his journey takes him from inner-city London to America's Bible belt. <em>AM</em></p> <h2>Switch<br>10pm, ITV2<br></h2> <p>Four modern young witches share a house in Camden, north London in this new supernatural comedy-drama. Former EastEnder Lacey Turner stars and Caroline Quentin plays one of the witches' overprotective mums. They struggle to juggle their advertising/physiotherapy careers with being both magic and beautiful. Of course, the Camden witches have a feud going with some posh ones from west London. It's not at all sophisticated or layered in a Buffy way but decent fluff nevertheless. <em>JNR</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Tuesday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397648183\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350037809883/The-Great-British-Bake-Of-008.jpg\" alt=\"The Great British Bake Off\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sue Perkins, Mary Berry, Paul Hollywood & Mel Giedroyc host The Great British Bake Off, BBC2. Photograph: Amanda Searle/Love Productions/BBC</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amanda Searle/Love Productions/BBC/Amanda Sear</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Great British Bake Off<br>8pm, BBC2</h2> <p>A nation gripped by soggy bottoms and Mary Berry's wardrobe sits on the edge of its collective sofa for the big final. Baking Bieber-alike John, tank top-wearing James and divo of detail Brendan have made it this far, but they must pull off three complicated technical challenges on the last stretch. Their pastry skills are tested to the limit with a pithivier and the dreaded fondant fancies, followed by the creation of a masterpiece from chiffon sponge. Fridge and pray, people. Fridge. And. Pray. <em>HV</em></p> <h2>Fresh Meat<br>10pm, Channel 4<br></h2> <p>Term two trundles on, with Heather increasingly attached to Kingsley, much to the chagrin of BFF Josie. JP is bedridden with mumps, with Vod the only person who can safely care for him. Howard becomes paranoid about household security after getting mugged for his shoes (or maybe just giving them away to three scary but silent hoodies), leading to new housemate/emotion-vacuum Sabine giving self-defence lessons to the girls. As ever, a huge amount packed into the hour, with not a single sub-plot left wanting. <em>MJ</em></p> <h2>Freddie Mercury: the Great Pretender \u2013 an Imagine Special<br>10.35pm, BBC1<br></h2> <p>Queen frontman Freddie Mercury's audience-eating-out-of-his-hand Live Aid performance cemented his reputation as one of rock's great frontmen. But what was the singer like offstage? Surprisingly shy and prone to moments of cattiness, to judge by the interviews in this documentary. For all that the narrative leads up to Mercury's death from Aids \u2013 at a time when prejudice surrounded the condition \u2013 there are plenty of funny moments: recording with Michael Jackson, we learn, was tough on account of Jacko's llama. <em>JW</em></p> <h2>Order and Disorder with Jim Al-Khalili<br>9pm, BBC4<br></h2> <p>As part of BBC4's Big Science week, a film about the story of energy. Or, as they say in TV land: \"How we discovered the rules that govern the universe.\" Here, Professor Jim Al-Khalili does a great job, among other things, of explaining that it is a painfully long process from a scientist having a lightbulb moment to that idea having a genuine effect on the wider world. From Leibniz's idea of the world as a \"living machine\", through to steam power and what we now call \"thermodynamics\", the realisation that energy isn't created or destroyed but instead transferred is a satisfying discovery to watch. <em>JR</em></p> <h2>Cuckoo<br>10pm, BBC3<br></h2> <p>Cuckoo extends his sphere of spiritual influence to Ken's father-in-law, after he deduces that a visiting cat is in fact the reincarnation of Ken's dead wife, Debra. Again, everyone bar Ken and Dylan is taken in by Cuckoo's bullshit, perhaps giving the first glimmer that there might not be much else to this likable new sitcom. Cuckoo (Andy Samberg) and Ken (Greg Davies) hog most of the best lines as usual, but the setups humiliating Ken and venerating Cuckoo appear to be treading much the same ground as previous weeks. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>White Collar<br>10pm, Alibi<br></h2> <p>The second season opener finds white-collar criminal Neal Caffrey back in and out of prison as he helps FBI handler Peter Burke solve more \"gentlemanly\" crimes. After the plane explosion that ended the first series, Caffrey is determined to find his girlfriend's killer, but there's a new superthief in town, the Architect, who sends everyone calling cards to tell them they're going to be robbed. It's a silly, far-fetched show, though not without a breezy charm provided by its central characters and enjoyably preposterous crimes. <em>PO'N</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Wednesday<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397648184\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350039384026/Who-Do-You-Think-You-Are--008.jpg\" alt=\"Who Do You Think You Are?

Photograph: Andrew Montgomery/BBC</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Montgomery/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Who Do You Think You Are?<br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Poking around his family tree tonight is John Barnes, a distinguished footballer for Liverpool and England. The most famous image of Barnes's career, as the introduction reminds us, depicts him backheeling a banana thrown at him by some racist idiot. Barnes always retained preternatural calm in the face of such stupidity, an ability he ascribes to a solid middle-class upbringing: his father was an officer in the Jamaican army. Barnes returns to Jamaica, where his mother reintroduces a family of journalists, trade unionists and agitators \u2013 they sound a genuinely fun bunch. <em>AM</em></p> <h2>Welcome to India<br>9pm, BBC2<br></h2> <p>This excellent series has taken a positive spin on the challenges facing India's urban underclass. A salutation to resourcefulness and good humour, Welcome to India has uncovered the unlikely opportunities individuals have spotted amid the apparent chaos of their surroundings. This final episode finds more dreams for the future and sacrifices in the present. Prakash aspires to be a film star \u2013 but his family have a more immediate requirement of him. Sujit, meanwhile has devised a way to visit his newborn daughter, hundreds of miles away. <em>JR</em></p> <h2>Dallas<br>9pm, Channel 5<br></h2> <p>Josh Henderson plays John Ross with such an artful swagger that it would be easy just to watch 40 minutes of his scheming \u2013 even better is that he doesn't have it all his own way, as his dodgy business partner Vicente is demanding results. Desperate to get the drilling rights to South Fork, he tries to enlist Lucy Ewing's support, while his entanglement with Marta leads to trouble. There are also repercussions for Bobby after his assault on Mitch, and wet blanket Christopher spends the episode trying to deal with Rebecca's bombshell. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Scam City<br>8pm, National Geographic<br></h2> <p>Conor Woodman braves the streets of Buenos Aires to see how travellers are being ripped off by enterprising locals. His knack for charming pickpockets, dodgy taxi drivers and a mistress of seduction means he gets a fascinating insight into the scammers' work. The police think he shouldn't try to find out too much about the people who run the underworld. \"They won't hesitate to shoot you,\" warns one officer, \"then cut you into pieces and put you inside a bin bag.\" Undeterred, Conor eventually tracks down the Artist, the man behind the city's counterfeit money, for an illuminating chat. <em>HV</em></p> <h2>The Final Frontier? A Horizon Guide to the Universe<br>9pm, BBC4<br></h2> <p>Horizon has always done a good job of presenting cosmological theories to the layperson without dumbing them down. So here, as part of BBC4's Big Science week, a special programme looks back at how our understanding of the universe has changed over the past 50 years. Dallas Campbell, a presenter on Bang Goes the Theory, trawls through the Horizon archive for footage that explains the mysteries of the cosmos, including Einstein's concept of space-time, what it's like on alien worlds and why you need extra dimensions to truly understand the universe. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Getting On<br>10pm, BBC4<br></h2> <p>Return of the dry medical comedy starring and written by Jo Brand, Vicki Pepperdine and Joanna Scanlan, and set in the geriatric ward of an NHS hospital. Kim, Den and Pippa move to ward K2 in St Jude's while their own hospital closes for a possible (but in no way guaranteed) refurb. Meanwhile, Pippa is causing her usual brand of chaos/inconvenience (inchaosvenience?) \u2013 dumping her baggage, figuratively and literally, all over her colleagues. Perfectly judged performances and great writing. <em>JNR</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Thursday<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397648185\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350039618363/Hunted-008.jpg\" alt=\"Hunted\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Melissa George as Sam Hunter in Hunted, BBC1. Photograph: Giles Keyte/BBC/Kudos</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giles Keyte/BBC/Kudos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Hunted<br>9pm, BBC1<br></h2> <p>This spy show is becoming more engrossing. Of course, like Spooks, there are scenes where chiselled operatives navigate knotty plots on futuristic laptops in glass buildings. Still, the mucky business of the job in hand (observing evil Jack Turner as he seeks to win a contract to build a dam in Pakistan) is agreeably gritty. This week Sam is thrown to see old lover/adversary Bernard at the bid meeting \u2013 but not so thrown she can't clobber his goons with a fire extinguisher. But what, pulling back for the bigger picture, is the \"Hourglass\" of the episode's title? <em>JR</em></p> <h2>Hebburn<br>10pm, BBC2<br></h2> <p>Despite a few moments when the comic timing isn't quite there as the cast beds in, standup Jason Cook's new sitcom, a kind of Tyne and Wear Royle Family, looks like a winner. The setup is that Jack (Chris Ramsey), now living in glitzy Manchester, visits his working-class folk with a middle-class, Jewish bride, Sarah (Kimberley Nixon), in tow. Trouble is, nobody else knows they're hitched. You know you're in safe hands from the moment mum Pauline (Gina McKee), wanting Sarah to feel at home, makes \"bagels\" by taking an apple corer to some bread rolls. <em>JW</em></p> <h2>My Tattoo Addiction<br>10pm, Channel 4<br></h2> <p>Exploring the world of ink, this special looks at the walking canvases that are emblazoned with some of the 20m tats currently in existence in the UK. The stories behind these indelible brandings vary from the fascinating to the oddly banal. There's the Ayia Napa rep who has 14 of them, including the website of a booze cruise across his chest. Then there's the tattoo addict with a fondness for face ink and a 67-year-old keen to cover up the racist daubings he had etched in his youth. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>Tails You Win: the Science of Chance<br>9pm, BBC4<br></h2> <p>Our lives, as Cambridge maths boffin Professor David Spiegelhalter argues, begin and end at the mercy of chance. Indeed, he notes, your chances as a 21st-century Briton of dying a violent, accidental death today are the same as tossing heads 20 times in a row \u2013 about one in a million. Understandably, much of human endeavour has amounted to an effort to quantify, regulate and eventually overcome chance. Spiegelhalter is an immensely engaging guide to this struggle, meeting seismologists, gamblers, statisticians and others who study the throw of the dice, metaphorical or literal. <em>AM</em></p> <h2>Red Dwarf<br>9pm, Dave<br></h2> <p>Following a malfunction with an Ikea-style flatpack (\"I knew those white plastic bits were important!\"), the crew find themselves catapulted back to the year AD23 on Earth, where they must make a 4,000-mile trek to India to find the lemons they'll need to make a battery, and in so doing run into a bearded figure who may or may not be Christ on his travels. There remains a hapless amiability about these comedic timeservers, even if it does feel as if, laugh-wise, we are stranded in 1988. <em>DS</em></p> <h2>Wilfred<br>10pm, BBC3<br></h2> <p>Wilfred blames the new scratches on his face on a run-in with a pack of dobermans, or \"dobies\" to use the racist dog term for them. It turns out, to Wilfred's embarrassment, that he was really the victim of a cat attack and he takes his revenge on all local kitties. While goofy plots like this provide the gags, they also help the characters grow in unexpected ways. It's hard to see how Ryan donning a gas mask and making a video threatening felines will eventually make him a better person, but somehow it does; one of the things that makes this show great. <em>PO'N</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Friday<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397648186\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350040377102/Stand-Up-to-Cancer-008.jpg\" alt=\"Stand Up to Cancer\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stand Up to Cancer, Channel 4. Photograph: Channel 4</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Stand Up to Cancer<br>7.30pm, Channel 4<br></h2> <p>The climax of a week of programming, in which Channel 4 has joined forces with Cancer Research UK for an indisputably noble cause, is a fundraising beano hosted by Alan Carr, Davina McCall and Dr Christian Jessen. Among the attractions are a special chat show hosted by Carr and a charity edition of The Million Pound Drop, interspersed with explanations of the research that the money raised will fund. Also appearing during the week are Kylie Minogue, Tom Daley and the Simpsons, among many others. <em>AM</em></p> <h2>Queen of Tigers: Natural World Special<br>9pm, BBC2<br></h2> <p>Colin Stafford-Johnson prefers to visit his old friends before they've gone, rather than attend their funerals; friends like Machli \u2013 now infirm and frail, but in her time, the most famous tiger in the world. A feisty fighter and devoted mother, Machli has provided the wildlife cameraman with 30 years of priceless memories: a ferocious Tigger to Stafford-Johnson's Christopher Robin. In this gorgeous-looking film, he returns to India to say his farewells to the Queen of Ranthambore National Park. <em>AJC</em></p> <h2>Me and Mrs Jones<br>9.30pm, BBC1<br></h2> <p>Gemma, the titular Mrs Jones (Coupling's Sarah Alexander), edges further towards an intergenerational clinch with new lodger and her son's friend from travelling, Billy, the dreamy Robert Sheehan from Misfits. Of course, things couldn't go to plan \u2013 and a dustup ensues at a school play, doing little to temper Gemma's perpetual state of flustered embarrassment. The only effective way to distinguish whether Me And Mrs Jones is supposed to be a comedy or not would be to add a laugh track as a rough guide. There are few clues otherwise in this mirthless dreck. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>Spy<br>8.30pm, Sky1<br></h2> <p>The second series of this sitcom has intimations of a soap; despite being set in the world of espionage, this takes a back seat to day-to-day romantic and family intrigues. A strong cast is headed by Darren Boyd as Tim, whose precocious son Marcus tonight makes his aggressive bid to become school president. Mark Heap is the hapless headmaster, Miles Jupp plays the appalling Owen and Robert Lindsay also features, looking like Jon Culshaw impersonating Alan Sugar. A running joke involving a hooded interrogee is the highlight of this week's silliness. <em>DS</em></p> <h2>The Choice<br>9pm, PBS America<br></h2> <p>In the blue corner: a president who not only inhaled but also thanked his pot dealer \"for all the good times\" in his senior year book. In the red: well, who? Who can pin down Mitt Romney, the man of whom one-time rival Ted Kennedy quipped, \"I am pro-choice, he's multiple choice\"? As America goes to the polls, here's a two-hour election special from PBS, featuring a run-through of both men's backgrounds, personal hangups and skill sets, plus the usual senate-load of talking heads. <em>AJC</em></p> <h2>The Walking Dead<br>10pm, FX<br></h2> <p>The second series was hamstrung by losing showrunner Frank Darabont and beset by budget problems. Judging by this opening episode of season three, matters have improved dramatically, though not for the beleaguered bunch at the show's centre. Zombie herds have kept the group trapped in one area; they need to find somewhere secure to hole up. A nearby prison seems the best bet but it's crawling with the undead. Are criminal zombies worse than the law-abiding ones we've met so far? Hard to tell, but there's plenty of action as the group make their new home zombie-free and meet some intriguing new characters. <em>PO'N</em></p>",

At the bottom of the balloon was a capsule, in which Baumgartner sat in his suit.</p> <p>As he reached the desired height, Baumgartner went through a checklist of 40 items with his mentor Joe Kittinger, the previous holder of the highest altitude manned balloon flight.</p> <p>There was some concern that a heater for his visor was not working, causing his visor to fog. \"This is very serious, Joe,\" he told Kitttinger. \"Sometimes it's getting foggy when I exhale. ... I do not feel heat.\"</p> <p>But they decided to go ahead, watched by a record 8 million people as the jump was streamed live on YouTube.</p> <p>The two-and-a-half hour journey upwards, during which the curvature of the earth became visible and the skies gradually turned black, was matched with a rather more rapid descent.</p> <p>Three cameras attached to Baumgartner's suit recorded his freefall of just over four minutes \u2013 which failed to break the existing freefall record for duration \u2013 and then the parachute opening. </p> <p>The success of the mission, and of the suit, raises the prospect that astronauts might be able to survive a high altitude disaster of the type that struck the space shuttle Columbia in 2003 by actually bailing out of their craft. </p> <p>Baumgartner's top medical man in the stunt was Dr Jonathan Clark, whose wife Laurel Clark died in the Columbia accident. Clark is now dedicated to improving astronauts' chances of survival in a high-altitude disaster.</p> <p>Baumgartner has made a name for himself with acts of daring. The former paratrooper has parachuted off buildings and mountains and once into a 600 foot deep cave. He had already done two practise freefalls in preparation for this attempt \u2013 one from 71,000 feet in March this year and a second from 97,000 feet in July. But no feat can possibly have matched his jump above the town of Roswell, a suitably chosen place famed for its connections to UFO sightings.</p> <p>He was chasing five different records: the first human to ever break the sound barrier in free-fall; the highest free-fall altitude jump, the highest manned balloon flight and longest free-fall and his jump platform is believed to be the largest manned balloon in history.</p> <p>The stunt, which was seven years in the planning and sponsored by Red Bull drinks, beat two of Kittinger's records: the retired US air force colonel previously held the high altitude and speed records for parachuting. Kittinger jumped from a balloon 19 miles above the planet in 1960. </p> <p>Suitably, the only voice in Baumgartner's radio earpiece guiding his ascent was that of Kittinger, now 84. </p> <p>Asked after the jump what he wanted to do next, Baumgartner said: \"I want to inspire a generation. I'd like to be sitting in the same spot in the next four years as Joe Kittinger. There is a young guy asking me for advice because he wants to break my record.\"</p> <p>He said the most exciting moment for him had been when he was standing outside the capsule \"on top of the world\". To laughter, he added: \"The most beautiful moment was when I was standing on the landing area and Mike Todd [the life support engineer who dressed Baumgartner in his suit] showed up and he had a smile on his face like a little kid.\"</p> <p>Baumgartner said that he had come to feel like Todd's son, adding: \"He was so happy that I was alive.\"</p> <p>Earlier, Todd had told the press conference: \"The world needs a hero right now, and they got one in Felix Baumgartner.\"</p> <p>To further laughter at the press conference, Kittinger said: \"I would like to give a special one fingered salute to all the folk who said that he [Baumgartner] was going to come apart when he went supersonic.\"</p> <p>This will be the last jump, Baumgartner said. He has promised to settle down and enjoy his post-jump years with his girlfriend, Nicole Oetl, flying \u00adhelicopters on rescue missions in the US and Austria.</p>",
