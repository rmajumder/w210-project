  "<p><strong>Hello Greg, how are you?</strong> Hi Small Talk, how you doing? I'm very well thank you.</p> <p><strong>We'd best get straight to business, Greg: you're on the phone because </strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/EASPORTSfootball\" title=\"\"><strong>you're promoting the launch of Fifa 13</strong></a><strong>. Are you and Usain Bolt both signing for Manchester United?</strong> I wouldn't mind that at all, Small Talk. My football background is a bit more extensive than Usain's, so I'd like to believe that if it came to it, I'd be a better football player than him. If there's a trial going, I wouldn't say no.</p> <p><strong>It says here that you had a trial for Aston Villa as a teenager. Was it difficult to decide whether to be an athlete or a footballer?</strong> It's an interesting one; I think to be honest I was a bit too lazy when it came to football. It was something that I picked up relatively quickly once I started, when I was about nine \u2013 before that I couldn't kick a ball. And then by the time I was 12 or 13 I was having professional trials. So I was very lazy with it, didn't try as hard as I possibly could, and I think really that's because I didn't enjoy it as much as I did the track. In the summer, track would come along and I'd love it, I'd train, I'd turn up for everything, and here I am. I went with my heart rather than my mind, because if you make it any level as a football player your life's going to be a bit different. I love the long jump, I love track and field, so it works for me.</p> <p><strong>[Sticking to the PR script] And presumably you still have time to show off your skills on a virtual pitch \u2026</strong> [Ignoring it] I'm not a huge gamer to be totally honest, I just don't have the time, so when I finally go to start playing I'm probably going to get shown up quite badly, and I'm quite concerned at how many are going to be stuck past me. I'm probably more nervous about this than I was at the Olympic final, to be honest with you. I hate losing, I hate being made to look stupid, and both might happen today.</p> <p><strong>Yes, this lack of nerves. What's that about?</strong> It's a weird one. You have to have nervous energy to perform, because that's what kicks your body into mode. But there's nervous energy where people are absolutely bricking it and it's detrimental, and there's nervous energy where you look at it and go, 'You know what? It's going to be amazing, I'm going to have the best time of my life and I'm going to go out and win this.'</p> <p><strong>But that brings its own pressure, doesn't it?</strong> Obviously my heart was beating faster \u2013 of course it was, I was in the London Olympic final \u2013 but the way I viewed it was very different, possibly, to some others who maybe let the occasion get to them. And that comes with experience. In previous years I had issues where probably I had let the nerves get to me a little bit too much and I underperformed, but there I felt so confident with the way I was training, the way I was jumping. I felt pretty good. The only time I was nervous was in Round Six, when I knew I was eight jumpers away from being Olympic champion and I had to just pick each one off and hope nobody jumped further than me.</p> <p><strong>Which of course they didn't. How annoying is it that some people have called you a 'lucky champion'?</strong> It is infuriating. At the end of the day, whenever anybody does something well, especially with sport, there will be an element of luck: things have to go well on that day. I've seen the flip side of it, I've been there when things have gone really badly for me \u2013 at the World Championships last year I tore my hamstring in half. That wasn't luck, but that was just, for whatever reason, things went wrong on that day. For people to then turn around and pat you on the head and go 'Alright mate, you were lucky, weren't you', you sort of think, well, what? I was world No1. You've sacrificed anything you possibly could to go out there and try to win, and then people go 'Ah yeah but you were lucky, weren't you?'. It's a bit of a frustrating thing to hear after a while, because it was years and years of hard work, of graft, building up to that one moment, and I went in as world No1. What was lucky about that?</p> <p><strong>So when are you off the celebrity circuit and back in to training? Has your coach, Dan Pfaff, decided where he'll be based?</strong> I think Dan's going to be in America, and we're going to work between the two of us. The thing is, it's all up in the air; we don't really know what's going on with anybody yet. UK Sport obviously have got to sort out who's working for them, and where, and everything else. So until then I can't make any finalised plans, but I think going forward I'll probably spend five or six months in America and then come back to the UK for the European circuit, then be in the UK for a bit, then probably do that again over the next four or five years. It should be good. As long as it works well and I keep doing well then I'll be happy.</p> <p><strong>We hear that you're a keen baker. Any chance you can squeeze the Great British Bake Off in to your schedule?</strong> I wouldn't mind that, to be totally honest. Baking is something that I do. I haven't had a lot of time over the last few months to get any done \u2013 and obviously I couldn't eat the produce, but now I can, so once I actually get some time to get home for a bit I'm going to get baking again and have some fun. It's just a way for me to relax at times. If I had the opportunity to go on certain shows I'd definitely be going on them.</p> <p><strong>And are you likely to make sugary concoctions or those slightly forlorn-looking savoury tarts?</strong> I'm very much a sweet-toothed person. There are days when I only feel like savoury, but generally I'm very sweet-toothed. So baking cakes I love.</p> <p><strong>What's your favourite?</strong> It's more a challenging one for me: it's a checkerboard cake. My attempt a few months ago didn't come out very well. My Mum is a great, great cook and a great baker; she sort of taught me. She makes the perfect checkerboard cake and I just want to perfect that technique. Basically when you cut it open it looks like a chess board. It's easier than it sounds but you have to have equipment to do it.</p> <p><strong>You've been spotted lunging and striding up and down Westminster Bridge in a bowler hat; </strong><a href=\"http://youtu.be/3-khGXvUTEE\" title=\"\"><strong>are you a Monty Python fan?</strong></a> [Laughing] That was a great campaign with Bupa to get more people active. It's probably not a direct reflection on my TV tastes. My favourite series of all time has been Band of Brothers. That was amazing, I've watched that so many times. And then recently I've just got in to Game of Thrones.</p> <p><strong>And what kinds of film do you like?</strong> Generally comedy-based things, so, I dunno, Anchorman and things like that are my favourites, but also anything world war two-based or medieval \u2026 I'm a bit of a history goon and I love all that. Anything that's medieval-based up until, probably, the Tudor period and just after, I'm quite in to.</p> <p><strong>Did you love history at school?</strong> It was the one subject that I could really apply myself to because I actually really enjoyed it. So that and a couple of others, that was sort of my fort\u00e9, but everything else I let go by the wayside really, I wasn't as keen. Even though arguably I could have done much better at school, I'd decided at a young age that I was going to be a professional sportsman at some sport. And at that stage there was a bit of luck: I was fortunate to meet the right people at the right time to get me to where I am now.</p> <p><strong>So if you were hosting a dinner party for figures from history, who would be invited?</strong> Someone asked me this question earlier. Initially I was thinking more about what would make interesting conversation. So I was thinking William the Conqueror, because basically he created modern day Britain, but whether the conversation would be that good I don't know \u2013 obviously my French would be slightly lacking, so I might need an interpreter. But it probably would be monarchs from previous years, so I'd go him; Henry VIII because he's just an interesting character, the way he changed when he had his fall off of his horse and then turned in to a fat Henry VIII; and then maybe someone like Queen Victoria. Just thinking about the way Britain changes hugely in those three moments with those three monarchs, I'd find it very interesting to pick their brains. It would be pretty amazing, although I imagine they'd expect some pretty lavish foods.</p> <p><strong>They'd want a perfect checkerboard cake, that's for sure. Who's the most famous person in your phone?</strong> My phone's in my bag and I don't know where my bag's gone. [Thinking] Probably between Rick Edwards, Amanda Byram... there's going to be somebody shouting at me now because I haven't thought of them. They're the two that I can think of off the top of my head, because they're people I actually chat to and they've become mates. Rick I'd known for a while because he did the commentary for athletics for Channel 4 last year, and I got to know him a bit through that. I've met lots more people post-Games.</p> <p><strong>Who or what would you put into Room 101?</strong> That's a good question because I'm normally quite carefree, so I'm</p> <p>trying to think what annoys me enough to dump them in to there. I laugh at most things, even on Twitter. [Small Talk drums its fingers helpfully on the desk] I know! People that drive very slow in the fast lane and completely and utterly hog the road. And you're not in a position to go past them. Yeah, that's when I rage. In the car, I do suffer from a bit of road rage.</p> <p><strong>Are you a boy racer, Greg?</strong> I drive relatively fast \u2013 within the remits of the law, obviously \u2013 but I struggle with people who do stupid things on the road. I have a massive urge to shout expletives at them.</p> <p><strong>What do you drive?</strong> <strong>Have you got one of those fancy German cars they were handing out in the summer?</strong> At the moment, I've only got a very humble Ford Mondeo. I think there's a deal being struck up at the moment with Range Rover, which is quite nice. So that'll be lovely if that comes together, I'll be very happy \u2013 quite a large upgrade from what I'm currently driving! No footballer's lifestyle up until this point.</p> <p><strong>What was your first car?</strong> It was a Vauxhall Corsa. I don't think it was even a one-litre, I think it was a 993cc engine. And I'll never forget going downhill, frantically trying to break the speed limit, because this thing just couldn't do it. They're great cars because they just can't break the speed limit, you'll never get a speeding ticket. I was there going up and down this hill, going 'Come on now, you can do it', and it was topping out.</p> <p><strong>How are your dogs? </strong><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-19285262\" title=\"\"><strong>Are they about to burst into the room and take over the interview?</strong></a> They're great. I just spent the last three days with them because I've not been very well, I've been in bed. [Small Talk rudely misses the moment's pause in which it should have asked if he was feeling better. Lazy journalism!] They were allowed on the bed, which they're not normally. They're very good. They're mental, but they're so much fun.</p> <p><strong>They're chocolate labradors, aren't they, the stupidest of them all? </strong>Yeah they are, they're absolutely ridiculous, the pair of them.</p> <p><strong>Can you take them training with you?</strong> I have done a couple of times. The trouble has been that I've had one of them run in front of me and I had to slam the brakes on and I bruised my heel. This was about three years ago, and after that point I never took them to the track. But they're great for hill sessions.</p> <p><strong>What would be your perfect evening?</strong> It would probably start off with a late afternoon coffee, because I love good coffee. It's one of my passions. I recently went to central London to get trained up as a barista; eventually I'd love to have my own coffee shop. But anyway, the evening: it would probably be getting a load of mates together and sitting round enjoying good coffee and good banter. That's what my ideal day would be. [On a burst of Serotonin] Plotting! We like to plot. Andrew Steele, who's one of my very close friends (he's a 400m runner), we like to plot and come up with schemes for businesses and inventions.</p> <p><strong>Right, you'd better get out there and get your backside kicked by a teenage Xbox whizz.

  "<p>It's hard to know what going on in the initial frames of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00wm8kf\" title=\"\"><strong>Hunted</strong></a> (BBC1), but it's pretty clear you're not quite meant to. During a slick and undeniably thrilling opening sequence in Tangier, the obvious main character, agent Sam Hunter (Melissa George), is killed twice. The first time she gets shot in the head in a manner that seems fairly unequivocal, but she just pulls off the blown-off bits and gets on with the rescue of a badly beaten scientist, dispatching tough guys with her bare hands before they have time to draw weapons. By her second shooting, we've learned that she's a private security operative, and pregnant (she's got the scan in her car), and now almost certainly dead.</p> <p>No \u2013 she's still alive (why do trained assassins, so professional in most aspects of their work, regularly forget to make sure their victims are all the way dead?), recuperating in hiding a year later, getting into shape \u2013 mostly hill-running and holding her breath in the bathtub \u2013 waiting until the time is right to resurface and take her old job back. But her main motive is to find out who set her up to be murdered.</p> <p>This eight-part series is being pitched as a sort of a homegrown Homeland, a thriller where it's hard to know who the good guys are, except Hunted is set in the world of private security, so there are no good guys. Trust is a rare commodity: Sam's old colleagues don't trust her (she disappeared for a year, and won't say why), she doesn't trust them (quite reasonably suspecting that one or more of them betrayed her), and as for their latest client, well, we're not allowed to know who it is. They aren't even allowed to know who it is. For people who don't trust anyone, these private security folk take an awful lot&#xa0;on faith.</p> <p>If the inevitable comparison with Homeland is unfavourable, it's probably also unfair. Hunted isn't \u2013 so far \u2013 remotely political, and it's already far more cynical. It doesn't have a likable character in it \u2013 even Sam is pretty charmless. But it's early days. What with the main character dying twice already, we've barely had time to get into the story, which involves a gangster-turned-millionaire trying to buy a dam in Pakistan, and a mysterious stranger who kills people by sticking a needle into the centre of&#xa0;the eyeball. It's gratuitously unpleasant, but I think that's what he likes about it. Meanwhile Sam, doing an impressive American accent, has wormed her way into the gangster's household. She won't remain unimperilled for long.</p> <p>It's safe to assume that no one is, at this point, quite who they seem to be, even in the credits. I noticed there was a character called Ian Fowkes played by an actor called Lex Shrapnel. Surely that must be the wrong way round. But no, I checked \u2013 that's his real name. He's Deborah Kerr's grandson.</p> <p><a href=\"http://uktv.co.uk/dave/series/tvseries/258942\" title=\"\"><strong>Red Dwarf</strong></a> (Dave) is back for a 10th series, 23 years after the sitcom first appeared on our non-flat TVs, after an absence of 13 years, barring a brief 2009 comedy-drama reunion. You might consider the idea of new Red Dwarf episodes to be a dubious proposition \u2013 a bit like getting Hear'Say back together \u2013 but it retains an affectionate worldwide cult following.</p> <p>Speaking as someone who didn't think much of it in its heyday \u2013 as far as I'm concerned it didn't have a heyday \u2013 I can only say it works as well as it ever did. In fact it's like watching a lost episode where the characters have suddenly aged 20 years for reasons that go unexplained. All the familiar elements are there: jokes that subscribe to a reliable formula (\"Your brain is smaller than the salad section of a Scottish supermarket\"), liberal use of the made-up swear word \"smeg\", the rust-bucket mining ship (\"slower than the speed of dark\"), plot lines that poke fun at hoary sci-fi conventions and a studio audience that finds everything at least twice as funny as you do. I can't imagine true fans of Red Dwarf being in any way disappointed.</p> <p>Watching the four main actors embrace their roles with an enthusiasm bordering on the joyful made me want to travel back in time and like it more. A few lines fall flat, some reveal an inventive flair still at work and one or two moments border on the inspired. In the end the writers were right not to tinker with the formula at all. Red Dwarf the sitcom is, like Red Dwarf the spaceship, creaky, old, underpowered and more or less indestructible.</p>",
  "<p>Health officials investigating a deadly outbreak of a rare fungal meningitis have urged doctors and hospitals across 23 states to contact patients who may have received a contaminated steroid injection in the last three months, in order to check them for symptoms.</p> <p>The rapidly evolving outbreak has already killed five people and a further 35 are ill in six states, some of them \"very seriously\".</p> <p>Officials, who have focused their investigations on an injection made by the New England Compounding Center (NECC), in Massachusetts, have expanded a recall and warned physicians, hospitals and clinics not use any products which may have come from the company. </p> <p>When investigators from the Food and Drug Administration inspected NECC's facility, they found a fungal contaminate in a sealed vial of a steroid, methylprednisolone acetate.</p> <p>They also found what they described as \"foreign material\" in another, opened vial. Tests are still being carried out to determine if the contaminant matches that causing the illnesses and to determine the second contaminant.</p> <p>NECC, which issued a recall of three lots of the steroid last week, has told the Food and Drug Administration that it is expanding its recall. The company is licensed to distribute injections in 50 states.</p> <p>Officials said all of those infected with fungal meningitis received spinal injections of a steroid solution sold by NEEC.</p> <p>The outbreak has renewed debate over who should regulate specialty pharmacies which combine, alter active ingredients or both to make custom medications, much like early pharmacists. They are under the control of state pharmacy boards, but critics have pointed to outbreaks of deadly infections linked to compounded pharmacies, as evidence that they need tighter controls by federal agencies.</p> <p>The New York Times reported a bacterial infection that killed nine people in two hospitals in Birmingham Alabama, in early 2011. Another 10 people were sickened by the Serratia marcescens bacteria, which was in an intravenous nutritional supplement prepared by a local compounding pharmacy.</p> <p>The FDA said it had issued a warning letter to NEEC in 2006, but it was not about the steroid solution. It did not elaborate.</p> <p>On Thursday, during a joint press conference by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), officials described the type of meningitis as \"severe\" and said early intervention was important for treatment.</p> <p>They said they did not know how many patients might be affected. Neither did they know how many doses of injection were in each lot of the steroids already recalled or the volume involved.</p> <p>Ilisa Bernstein, director of compliance at the FDA's center for drug evaluation and research, said: \"Given the severity of the illness, we believed this precautionary measures are necessary to protect public health.\"</p> <p>Dr Benjamin Park, a medical officer at the CDC, said the number of infected patients is expected to grow, as the three lots of methylprednisolone acetate initially recalled by the company on 26 September were distributed to 75 health care facilities in 23 states.</p> <p>Park said: \"If patents are concerned, they should call to find out if they have received medicine from one of these lots\"</p> <p>Asked if it were possible that the products could be available in more than 23 states, Bernstein said: \"There is a risk that's why we are asking physicians hospitals and clinics not to use their products at all.\"</p> <p>To date, they have no evidence of any ill effects of any other NECC product, according to the CDC.</p> <p>She said they were working with the company to establish a list of products they manufacture.</p> <p>Twenty-five of the cases are in Tennessee, where a Nashville clinic received the largest shipment of the steroid, according to officials at the CDC. Four cases have been reported in Virginia, two in Maryland, two in Florida, one in Indiana and one in North Carolina. Three of the deaths were in Tennessee, one in Virginia and one in Maryland.</p> <p>The type of meningitis involved is not contagious like the more common forms. This type is caused by a fungus often found in leaf mould and which health officials suspect may have been in the steroid.</p> <p>Early intervention is important in treatment and could improve the outcome in patients, Park said.</p> <p>\"Fungal meningitis is quite a rare infection and physicians may not be suspecting it. The treatment is an anti-fungal medicine given intravenously, so a patient would be admitted to hospital.\"</p> <p>Treatment for the illness could take months. He said the steroid is usually given for back pain and that the patients tended to be older but were otherwise in good health.</p> <p>What is not clear is whether new infections are occurring. Federal health officials are looking for, and increasingly finding, illnesses that occurred in the past two or three months.</p> <p>At three clinics in Tennessee, officials are contacting the more than 900 people who received the steroid in the past three months. The incubation period is estimated at anywhere from two to 28 days, so some people may not have fallen ill yet, Tennessee health officials said.</p> <p>Meningitis is an inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include severe and worsening headache, nausea, dizziness and fever. Some of the patients also experienced slurred speech, and difficulty walking and urinating, Tennessee health officials said.</p> <p>\"Some are doing well and improving. Some are very ill, very, very seriously ill and may die,\" Dr David Reagan, a Tennessee health official, said of the state's patients.</p> <p>Investigators also have been looking into the antiseptic and anaesthetic used during the injections. Neither has been ruled out. However, the primary suspicion is on the steroid medication. Steroid shots are common for back pain, often given together with an anaesthetic.</p>",
  "<p>As a dress rehearsal for Sunday's home date with Manchester United, this European interlude could barely have been bettered. Responding to Alan Pardew's request to \"up their levels\" Newcastle rediscovered some of last season's power and rhythmic poise in time to not only overwhelm an initially awkward Bordeaux but also offer Sir Alex Ferguson reason for anxiety.</p> <p>Along the way Pardew's players enhanced their chances of qualifying for the Europa League's knockout stages, particularly as Bordeaux were many pundits' favourites to win the group.</p> <p>\"I wanted us to play with a bit more energy, verve, audacity and ambition and we did that against strong opponents who were on a 17-game unbeaten run,\" said Pardew, who this week had reportedly \"read the riot act\" to his squad. \"Our control, our passing was terrific,\" he added. \"It's a relief; we set ourself standards last year that we hadn't reached this season \u2013 until tonight.\"</p> <p>Fast, fluid and frenetic it all began in exhilaratingly open mode. Yohan Cabaye dispatched an angled shot narrowly wide of a post, Bordeaux's Ludovic Obraniak headed over the bar after connecting with Jaroslav Plasil's cross and then, in the 16th minute, Newcastle were ahead.</p> <p>The ever dangerous Gabriel Obertan, deployed, unusually, on the left of Pardew's front three, met Cabaye's wonderful pass and, thanks to a mixture of scorching pace and slick changes of feet, outwitted his marker, Mariano. All too often Obertan- who began his career at Bordeaux - betrays much thrilling approach work with substandard crosses but this time his left-wing centre was low and ideally measured for Shola Ameobi to tap in at the far post.</p> <p>At that stage Bordeaux's passing and movement remained far too clever for Pardew to relax and he could have done without Cheik Tiot\u00e9 collecting yet another yellow card for a late tackle on Henri Saivet. With the Ivorian's abrasive style restricted not only by the need to watch his step but an ankle knock, Ludovic San\u00e9, Bordeaux's midfield enforcer, temporarily exerted a bigger influence on proceedings than Tiot\u00e9 might have hoped. No matter; Danny Simpson, back at right-back following a hamstring injury, soon met Ameobi's ball and supplied a cross so teasing and testing that Henrique turned it into his own net.</p> <p>Although Hatem Ben Arfa, Demba Ba, Jon\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez and Davide Santon were rested, much of Newcastle's old fluency was returning and, despite forcing a flurry of early chances and corners, Bordeaux folded after Papiss Ciss\u00e9 scored his team's third. Ciss\u00e9 had been having a quiet evening to Ameobi's right but when Shane Ferguson, promising at left-back, unleashed a splendid delivery the Senegal striker, albeit marginally offside, swept a left-foot shot past C\u00e9dric Carrasso. For the third time Bordeaux could summon no answer to a stellar cross.</p> <p>A streaker briefly interrupted things, wrestling with stewards before, eventually, being arrested, but there was to be no stopping Newcastle.</p>",
  "<p>The Murdochs have received a major endorsement from shareholder advisory group ISS, after it recommended investors vote to re-elect News Corp's board of directors at its annual meeting.</p> <p>The move is a reversal for ISS \u2013 Institutional Shareholder Services \u2013 one of the most influential shareholder advisory firms in the US, which last year was highly critical of News Corporation in its advice to investors ahead of the company's annual general meeting.</p> <p>It comes after a number of investors and advisory firms joined an action on Wednesday launched by dissident shareholders seeking to break Murdoch control of News Corp. The campaign includes Hermes, a British fund manager that controls \u00a32.4bn in assets, and Glass Lewis, which advises institutions holding $15tn (\u00a39.6tn) worth of investments. Glass Lewis took the same stance in 2011.</p> <p>The resolution was co-filed by Christian Brothers Investment Services and members of the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum.</p> <p>The shareholder dissent is largely symbolic, since the Murdochs control about 40% of the company's voting shares.</p> <p>News Corp's annual meeting is scheduled for 16 October. The ISS report said shareholders should vote for the current directors and expect to see independent action from the board to address any findings, allegations or penalties against the company when the phone hacking investigations conclude.</p> <p>ISS, which advises more than 1,700 clients on corporate governance issues, said last year the phone-hacking revelations at News of the World exposed a \"striking lack of stewardship\" and it called on shareholders to vote against the re-election of nearly all of the media group's board, including Rupert Murdoch and his sons James and Lachlan.</p>",
  "<p><em>Spoiler alert: this blog is for those watching Hunted on BBC1. Please do not read on if you haven't seen episode one</em></p> <p>Spooks may have gone for good. But what if there were a new, even more loopy spy thriller to take its place? A big, daft, posturing show which could make someone having their face shoved in a deep fat fryer look like The Good Life? Wonder no longer. Hunted, written by Frank Spotnitz (a great name for a school head-lice inspector) karate-kicked its way into your living room last night and now you're here, perhaps despite your better judgment, wanting to know what the hell just happened. Come in, sit down in my ergonomic briefing room and let me fill you in.</p> <h2>Titles</h2> <p>The music is standard espionage twanginess with hints of Moroccan wailing. Visually it's all swirling egg-timers with occasional glimpses of our heroine pouting, then running, then pouting. See how the sand trickles through the egg-timer \u2013 almost symbolically, you might say. Oh, it has smashed. This foreshadows the doom to come. It is quite doomy in tone. Like Hustle with manic depression.</p> <h2>Premise</h2> <p>Hunted stars Melissa George as spy-for-hire Sam, but you'll remember her as blond hippy child Angel in Home &amp; Away and that bit part she played in Friends a while back. She's now an ass-kicking brunette with a duck-pout to rival Daffy and, most of the time, a right mood on her. If she's not glowering at everyone in a one-mile radius she's crouching in a corner having one of her distressing childhood flashbacks.</p> <p>At the start of tonight's opener, she was under cover in Tangier (beige filter on camera plus big Moroccan lamps indicates sultry eastern location) pretending to be a gangster's girlfriend when really she was engaged in a plot to free one of their hostages. The setup was all very Bourne Identity in that she \"went rogue\" and disappeared for a year following an attempt on her life. But who sent the goons with guns to rub her out?</p> <h2>Violence</h2> <p>It only took Sam to face off with her first assailant to make clear how wonderfully improbable the rest of the series is going to be. The violence was A-Team good. Some bloke came at her with a gun: she snapped him like a twig while holding up a wheezing hostage with the other arm. At about 5ft 4in and a size eight, she then took out three heavily armed hoodlums with automatic rifles and a cop who'd just shot her at close range in the stomach. That's some punch she's packing.</p> <p>It's not long before we realise that Sam has returned to work so the people who tried to kill her can try again. We know this because Aiden helpfully explains it when he comes to her new flat. And the baddy who is sent to get her is credited simply as Blank Faced Man. He looks fully terrifying and prefers to kill his victims with a syringe full of poison in their eyeballs! Camp as! It's not hugely gory but Hunted is clearly going to enjoy camping up the violence quite a bit.</p> <h2>Getting to know Sam</h2> <p>When the action switches from dusty Tangier back to the UK, the filter is changed to a bleak, grey to emphasise Sam's deep and unrelenting gloom about all things. She wears grey and black with an occasional colour pop in the form of a woolly hat. Those jogging, bath-soaking montages might have been excessive, but I did enjoy that she kept changing her hat to demonstrate the passing of time. How many hats can one spy have?</p> <p>And can we talk about her accent? George is Australian trying to do posh British and has spent a lot of time in America. So we end up with that oddly haughty Brit twang that Kylie probably does when she meets the Queen. I keep wanting her to let rip with a \"cobber\" or a \"dag\". She's clearly dying to.</p> <p>By the time Sam gets to London to re-start her job, she has plumped for a boring grey beanie hat to fully describe her internal misery. I predict the hat will try to make a play for the same sort of iconic status as Sarah Lund's jumper. It won't make it, sadly. It needed a cable stitch through it or some decorative snowflakes.</p> <p>The other thing we know about Sam at this early stage is that she was abducted as a child by persons unknown and they also murdered her mother. Flashback is use often to remind you of this. In fact, so fond is she of flashbacks at, at only 18 minutes into the first episode, she flashes back pretty much all of the 18 minutes you've just seen. Incredible.</p> <h2>Memorable moments</h2> <p>\u2022 Sam opening the kitchen cupboard in her remote cottage to reveal 50 tins of spam. If she's been living on that for the past year, it's probably a good job she lives alone.</p> <p>\u2022 The duck-pout closeups. There are so many in the first episode I found myself involuntarily throwing bread at the screen.</p> <p>\u2022 When the terrifying murderer ambushes the Dutch doctor before killing him he says: \"There's been an accident.\" When the doctor asks if it's his son the killer replies: \"No, it's you,\" before shoving him over and plunging a needle into his eye. Eww and also yay!</p> <h2>Plot holes</h2> <p>\u2022 If Sam's secret hideaway for a year was actually her childhood home (the scarecrow in the flashbacks is the same as the one in the garden) how come her bosses couldn't find her? They're spies, right?</p> <p>\u2022 They really did call her Sam Hunter so that the \"Hunter\" could become the \"Hunted\". Amazing.</p> <p>\u2022 In her new London flat by the railway line she carefully builds a secret entrance to a hidden room containing all of her computer equipment and dossiers and such like. But the secret room has a big window looking out on to the street that she sits right in front of to do all of her secret business. Did she forget to retake her final year at spy school?</p> <h2>Quotes of the week</h2> <p><strong>Keel:</strong> \"Every second I open my eyes each morning and I consider the infinite variables of the chaos than can occur during the working day. Because I like to be one step ahead, I don't like to be on the back foot. But I am on the back foot now. Because of all the infinite variables of the chaos that I pondered this morning, the one that never crossed my mind was that you'd be standing in front of me.\" (A simple 'Fancy seeing you here' would have done the trick.)</p> <p>Tense scene between villain father and his nicer son:</p> <p><strong>Jack Turner:</strong> What do you know about bringing up a kid?</p> <p><strong>Stephen Turner:</strong> About as much as you.</p> <p><strong>Jack:</strong> I did my best.</p> <p><strong>Stephen:</strong> Well I'm going to do better. My firstborn's not going to end up gutted with his dick cut off.</p> <h2>Next week</h2> <p>\"What's your impression of Sam?\" asks big spy boss Keele. At this point I'd like them to cut to the rest of the team all wearing grey beanie hats and doing sulky faces. I suspect this won't actually come to pass.</p> <p>Keele continues to express doubts about Sam's commitment to the organisation in his ridiculously overblown estate agent's prose. \"Do you perceive her capabilities have diminished in any way?\" he asks Aiden. \"No, I don't perceive that.\".</p> <p>Sam, now installed in her latest undercover role as a child's nanny, meets the terrifying-looking assassin we know has been sent to kill her. But she can't see he is wielding a syringe behind his back. Tune in next week for more nonsense! This is going to be fun.</p>",

It was also the first time Cook had been in the driving seat for an Apple presentation \u2013 which for years had been led by Steve Jobs, whose skill at making new products look desirable had become famed as a \"reality distortion field\".</p> <p>But Jobs was at his home nearby in Silicon Valley, gravely ill with neuroendocrine cancer, which had first been diagnosed in 2003, and surgically treated in 2004. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/oct/06/steve-jobs-apple-cofounder-dies\" title=\"\">Jobs died the day after Cook stood on the stage</a>; his death led to a huge \u2013 and, to many, puzzling \u2013 outpouring of grief, and to a more explicable flurry of analyses suggesting that without its co-founder, Apple would wither on the vine.</p> <p>A year on, Apple doesn't look like a company in serious trouble. It has risen in value by more than 75%, from $346.2bn (\u00a3215.2bn) on 4 October last year to $619.9bn at the time of writing, becoming <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/aug/20/apple-most-valuable-firm-facebook\" title=\"\">the most valuable listed company in the world</a> and bringing it close to an all-time inflation-adjusted record (beaten only by Microsoft in 1999). It has sold more iPhones in that period than ever before (and then bettered that with pre-orders for the iPhone 5, which was released last month). Its profits have kept growing, in apparent defiance of any law of economic gravity.</p> <p>\"I never viewed my role as to replace him,\" Cook told the AllThingsDigital conference in May. \"Steve was an original. I don't think another one of those is being made. I never felt the weight of being Steve.\"</p> <p>But is Apple really the same company without Jobs and with Cook as its helmsman? Inside the company, the word is that nothing seems different; business goes on as usual, work gets done, the relentless pressure on the staff continues. One thing that has gone: Jobs's sometimes infuriating (to staff) ability to argue one position on one day, and the exact opposite the next. \"I saw it daily,\" Cook said.</p> <p>But without Jobs, can Apple still innovate? <a href=\"http://blogs.forrester.com/george_colony/12-04-25-apple_sony\" title=\"\">George Colony of Forrester Research suggested in April</a> that Apple will, like Sony after the death of its leader, Akio Morita, in 1999, decline: \"When Steve Jobs departed, he took three things with him: 1) singular charismatic leadership that bound the company together and elicited extraordinary performance from its people; 2) the ability to take big risks; and 3) an unparalleled ability to envision and design products.\"</p> <p>He suggested that Apple had between two and four years before revenue growth and product innovation would stall.</p> <p>Cook, though, denied that Jobs had had such a key importance, especially in the product field. \"The [product] curator role moves around as it always had [when Jobs was there],\" Cook told the ATD conference. \"No one person does it all.\"</p> <p>Cook, like Jobs, still runs a tight ship in every sense: Apple is secretive about its plans and workings, with high-profile one-off presentations run by the top executives \u2013 Cook; the marketing chief, Phil Schiller; the iPhone software chief, Scott Forstall \u2013 over off-the-record meet-the-press brunches. For journalists and analysts, predicting Apple's next move is like being a Kremlinologist in the Soviet era: the slightest shift in public posture or hint of an approach to another company is minutely examined, and can stir rumours and make stock prices yo-yo.</p> <p>Cook himself remains largely an enigma \u2013 though famed in the industry for his ability to control the supply chains that are essential to any hardware maker's success. Single, and just weeks from his 52nd birthday, he is known as a fitness nut who goes hiking and cycling, and whose day often starts at 4.30am with a barrage of emails. His real skill, analysts agree, lies in the hidden iceberg of getting products built: the \"supply chain\" of manufacturers and parts makers who contribute everything that goes into the phones, tablets and computers it sells.</p> <p>Yet to external observers, quite a few subtle differences are evident in the year since Jobs's death. The first was <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/2/2766403/tim-cook-apple-charity-project-red-stanford\" title=\"\">Cook's decision in February to make donations to charity with Apple's money</a> \u2013 $50m to Stanford hospitals, and a further $50m to other causes since then. Jobs, it was commonly agreed, would never have done that; one book, Inside Apple, quotes him as saying that giving money away was \"a waste of time\". (And, presumably, money.)</p> <p>The same month came another surprise: <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/02/13Fair-Labor-Association-Begins-Inspections-of-Foxconn.html\" title=\"\">a statement about working conditions at the Foxconn plants in China</a> where iPhones and iPads are made and assembled, in which Cook said: \"We believe that workers everywhere have the right to a safe and fair work environment\" and instituted wide-ranging checks by the Fair Labor Organisation, after a growing chorus of criticism over worker suicides and reports of exploitation.</p> <p>Next was another move involving money: in March, Cook announced that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/mar/19/apple-dividend-share-buyback\" title=\"\">Apple would begin paying a dividend on its shares</a>, for the first time since March 1995. That was when it first began to run into financial problems \u2013 from which it was only saved by Jobs's return in 1997, and then his hiring of Cook to take over the supply chain in 1998. Also in March this year, Cook did yet another thing Jobs never did: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/mar/27/apple-tim-cook-visits-china\" title=\"\">a public visit to the Foxconn factories</a>, where he was photographed on the assembly lines \u2013 something that none of the senior executives at other companies who also use Foxconn, such as Dell, HP or Microsoft, has done.</p> <p>Charities, fair labour, dividends \u2013 all put a much more empathic face on a company that under Jobs had seemed hard and uncaring, particularly over Chinese workers' conditions.</p> <p>That suggests that Cook is trying to mould the company to see itself not as a scrappy underdog \u2013 as it was under Jobs until recently \u2013 but as what it actually is, a business giant, even though (as Cook once put it) all the individual products it sells could fit on a tabletop.</p> <p>\"I think the overarching theme for Cook v Jobs is that Cook is trying to show a softer side of Apple,\" says Horace Dediu, who runs the Asymco consultancy. \"He seems to be willing to put a gentle and less recalcitrant face on the company. All these things, even dividends, are signals that Apple is kinder, gentler. However, it's early days. Every new manager wants to place his mark on the company and distance himself from the predecessor. In many ways they [Apple] have not changed.\"</p> <p>Ian Fogg, head of mobile at IHS Screen Digest, says: \"If there is a change in Apple under Cook \u2013 and that's far from certain \u2013 it has been one of communication tone, and not product substance. Apple now appears slightly softer, more human, more socially aware in its communications and is more willing to respond to consumer feedback.\"</p> <p>The clearest example of that came just last month, when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/sep/28/apple-maps-tim-cook-apology\" title=\"\">Cook penned an abject apology</a> for the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/sep/20/apple-maps-ios6-station-tower\" title=\"\">quality of the maps service on the new iPhone operating system</a>. With 100 million people using it within just a week, the criticisms about errors \u2013 in locations, naming, or omissions \u2013 were overwhelming. Cook said he was \"extremely sorry\" and suggested a number of rival mapping services \u2013 including Nokia's and Microsoft's \u2013 available to iPhone users instead.</p> <p>A number of commentators said that Jobs would never have written such an apology \u2013 and would never have allowed maps of that quality to be released as a fully fledged product. But Carolina Milanesi, smartphone and tablets analyst at the Gartner research group, disagrees: \"People think that Steve [Jobs] would have never brought maps to market. But there are indeed examples of products or services that came to market under Steve that were not perfect: 'antennagate' with the iPhone 4 [where call quality fell when the phone was held in the left hand] and Mobile Me [Apple's first attempt at a cloud service in July 2008, which saw people lose emails and synchronisations fail].\" She thinks that when it came to the maps apology, \"doing a mea culpa was less damaging than letting people think that Apple's core values have changed\".</p> <p>Ironically, given Cook's expertise at wringing the best out of Apple's suppliers, it's also the supply chain that most threatens the company's treasured secrecy about what it will do next. Ahead of the iPhone 5 launch, almost every detail about its physical appearance was known: the screen size, new charging interface, camera. That's because parts and photos had leaked out from various plants \u2013 and because iPhones are made by the million, and there's huge value to rivals and accessory makers in knowing what the next model will look like, such details have become precious knowledge indeed.</p> <p>The latest supply chain leaks \u2013 <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304141204577506471913819412.html\" title=\"\">reported by the Wall Street Journal</a>, which demands at least two separate sources for any \"anonymous\" story \u2013 suggest that Apple is building an \"iPad mini\", a smaller version of its iPad, to be unveiled later this month. It will be the first entirely new product Cook has overseen; analysts are already totting up how many millions it might sell in the months until Christmas, even before its existence is confirmed.</p> <p>It's been a long haul for Cook, who said he wanted to work with Jobs within five minutes of his job interview in 1998. But he still has some way to go. Milanesi, says: \"The status of demigod that Steve had meant he got away with more than your average CEO gets away with. Tim is not Steve. Which is not good or bad. Just different.\"</p>",
  "<p>Consider a man who lost a job of hard toil, just after turning 60 in June last year. His creaking bones will just have been subjected to 12&#xa0;months of being poked and prodded by the harsh rules of the jobseeker's allowance, under which the \u00a371 he is expected to survive on each week is docked if he declines any opportunity to deliver pizzas or sweep up in a barber's in return for the minimum wage. Then last month \u2013 out of the blue \u2013 he will suddenly have found that his stipend doubled, at the very same moment as all those demeaning strictures disappear. In another few weeks, the same man who spent months being humiliated by the state will witness it taking a Good King Wenceslas turn \u2013 handing him a no-strings \u00a3200, to take care of his winter fuel.</p> <p>Social security is getting better at providing for people because they are old, and worse at providing for them because they are poor. Those harsh jobseeker's rules will before long be applied to 64-, 65- and even 66-year-olds who've been thrown on the scrapheap; meanwhile David Cameron is pledged to protect that \u00a3200 not only for our laid-off labourer, but also for the sexagenarian exec from the other side of town. By the time George Osborne has finished, poor families may have lost around a quarter of their livelihood. Even while he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/18/social-security-george-freeze\" title=\"\">rewrites the rules on indexation for a second time</a>, to make absolutely certain he can diddle them out of what they would need to cover rising shopping bills, he has signed off on new rules for pensions that will see them climb not merely with inflation, but with wages when these rise more rapidly. No wonder <a href=\"http://www.ifs.org.uk/comms/comm124.pdf\" title=\"\">the IFS recently reported</a> that: \"The rate of relative pensioner poverty is now lower than the rate for any other major demographic group.\"</p> <p>The link between old age and penury, cast-iron ever since the days of the poor law, has finally been broken. It is a great achievement \u2013 in which Gordon Brown's pension credit played no small part \u2013 and yet comes laced with a bitter irony. The same state that funds freedom passes and free TV licences turns a cold shoulder when frailty requires personal care. The indignity of being left alone, undressed or unwashed, competes with anxiety that is born of the knowledge that if you start paying for care and turn out to need it for years, it will end in the sort of financial ruin that no state pension or fuel payment can protect against. All the while, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/04/dilnot-care-commission-fear-editorial\" title=\"\">Andrew Dilnot's elegant proposal</a> \u2013 to tackle the catastrophic care costs that befall a minority and frighten everybody, by pooling risks \u2013 sits gathering dust, as the Treasury pleads lack of funds.</p> <p>There is a role for universal benefits in binding the whole nation into its welfare state, but in circumstances like these \u2013 where the younger poor are being made so much poorer, and where the frail elderly are being left in neglect \u2013 they plainly require a solid justification. The child benefit and disability payments which the coalition attacks do, in fact, have a clear rationale \u2013 seeing to it that the very particular costs of parenting or overcoming an impairment need not make someone worse off. There is no similarly specific argument to justify the pensioner perks. Yes, it is imperative that the elderly keep warm, and yes, very many among them rely on the television for company. But neither a fuel bill nor a TV licence are specific to them in quite the same way as a scooter or a packet of Pampers are to disabled people and young families.</p> <p>No wonder, then, that Labour is hinting it will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/03/labour-curbs-universal-benefits-care\" title=\"\">look again at these freebies</a>. But it will not do more than hint because of the real rationale \u2013 courting a large and growing grey band of voters, who are <a href=\"http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=2613\" title=\"\">almost twice as likely to make the trip to the ballot box</a> as those at the other end of the age range. Many among them who are not particularly poor nonetheless feel aggrieved by the rock-bottom interest rates and quantitative easing that are sustaining the economy at the cost of depressing their annuities and investment returns. That resentment is understandable enough. But in hard times like these a responsible government would decide to put more pressing claims first.</p>",
  "<p>The Tories will gather this weekend in the throes of mid-term blues. Are these death throes? All hangs in a fine balance, say the pollsters. Will \"don't let the others wreck it again\" win the economic argument, or will David Cameron get it in the neck for turning growth into a greater debt mountain?</p> <p>Stunned by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19803646\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband's one nation coup</a>, the word is that Cameron is in a frantic rewrite: Steve Hilton has flown in to help. Attack, attack, attack on Labour is a key theme, while others urge a radical rightwing growth plan to shock the world with its audacity. Some spot a mirage of green shoots, others ooze despondency. Fraser Nelson, the Spectator's editor, writes: \"<a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2012/10/fraser-nelson-says-that-david-camerons-defeat-is-horribly-likely.html\" title=\"\">By now, it will be clear even to David Cameron that he is on course to lose the next election</a> \u2026 the economic recovery has evaporated and with it the Tories' chances of winning next time \u2026 Every bookmaker now agrees: Cameron is heading for a crash.\"</p> <p>Tory MPs report local troops melting away, disillusioned by Cameron's assaults on heartland feelings \u2013 gay marriage, planning laws and high-speed rail cutting through home-county heritage.</p> <p>Is there no hope? The one shard Nelson offers is: \"An implosion in the European Union may lead to British withdrawal, in which case all bets are off.\" Frankly, if succumbing to another bout of Tory euro-virus is their idea of salvation, they are in big trouble. Ben Page of Ipsos Mori says Europe is nowhere on the radar: only 3% ever mention it as a concern. But at least the party would die happy.</p> <p>For a majority, Cameron needs to top 42%, six points more than he scored against Gordon Brown. The dumb stupidity of trashing Lords reform meant they lost the boundary changes that might have tipped a close result in their favour. Now they're in a hole \u2013 and they're still digging.</p> <p>Tim Montgomerie, influential voice of ConservativeHome, is no more optimistic. Ask him and he points to his party's failure to win the last four elections. The left is united as never before, sucking up Lib Dem votes while the Tories leak theirs to Ukip \u2013 set to win at least 6%, he reckons. \"Cameron can't carry on like this. Policy has to change,\" he says, urging a long-term economic plan for competitiveness. What would that be? Here's Montgomerie's list: simplify the tax system with a nearly-flat tax. Radically deregulate, including the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/21/minister-answer-question-no-fault-dismissal?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Beecroft proposals with employers' right to \"fire at will\"</a>. Build a Thames estuary airport. Bring in profit-making schools. \"These add up to an economic rescue programme,\" he says, \"which we can tell people on the doorstep is the only way to save the NHS and the social safety net.\"</p> <p>With his usual disarming lack of guile, he adds: \"I know these would not be popular.\" Indeed, they look suicidal: flatter tax means less tax for the rich; and there is zero evidence that weakening Britain's modest employment rights has any good economic effect. These would be hazard-light warnings that his is the party of the rich.</p> <p>Companies siphoning money out of state schools is hardly a winner either. Never mind, he just wants a big, bold dividing line, an argument to the death on the fundamentals. \"It would polarise debate but it would give us a platform.\" Where have I heard that kind of talk before? Ah, yes, Labour at its lowest in the 1980s, when a good ideological fight mattered more than winning. How odd to hear all this extremism from a party in power. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Britannia Unchained</a>, a book written by the Tory party's most successful young MPs, the next generation looks even wilder than this one.</p> <p>Coalition has driven them to distraction. Didn't they do better when Cameron pretended to be nice? No, says Montgomerie: all that climate change, women in politics and gay rights \"made people like you look in the shop window, but not buy\". His party needs the blue-collar voter who sees Ed Miliband as too much the metropolitan liberal. Well, maybe, but then what do the blue collars see when they look at Cameron and Osborne? Tough on immigration, easing inheritance tax and restoring a 10p tax rate are his lures. Pollster Ben Page says campaigning on immigration doesn't work: \"Michael Howard used it to the max. It's magic for those that like it, but it's sparkle dust for only a quarter of voters.\"</p> <p>For another signpost to suicide, look at a well-briefed <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/33acb8ca-00b3-11e2-9dfc-00144feabdc0.html#axzz28LuWAhLJ\" title=\"\">recent FT article</a> from former Tory thinktanker and George Osborne biographer Janan Ganesh. Here's the dottiness: they will create more Tory voters by cutting tax credits and child benefit from many families and taking away their public sector jobs. That breeds new Tory voters because they are no longer dependent on the state. The public sector head count has fallen by half a million, so \"Labour's client state is shrinking\". This is, he admits, a bit counter-intuitive. He adds that, despite the budget's damage to his \"reputation for tactical nous\", Osborne's \"strategic mind continues to whirr\". Long may it do so, Labour must wish.</p> <p>Too few Tory moderates survive to call them a tendency. One I spoke to wanted to reclaim one nation for his party, alarmed that all generosity of spirit was attributed to the Lib Dems, all meanness a \"caricature\" of his party. He may be in denial that his side of the house is now entirely occupied by tougher-than-Thatcherites, themselves fractiously tugged rightwards by Nelson and Montgomerie pressures. Without unforced fiascos such as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/04/west-coast-rail-whitehall-brain-drain?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">train bids</a>, ahead lie roadblocks of their own devising: Labour is already winning on the NHS, before crises erupt. Benefit cuts are a Tory winner for now \u2013 but, Montgomerie agrees, not for long once horror stories emerge from April's disability cuts. Universal credit and the work programme are among a string of unexploded land mines.</p> <p>Certain Tory strategists expected only one term in this malign economic climate: that's why they dashed for unpopular uprooting of the NHS and education, dismantling the state regardless of unpopularity. Curiously, others in their party fail to appreciate that plan. \"If you put a gun to my head, I'd say Ed Miliband will be the next prime minister,\" says Montgomerie glumly. Labour is rightly cautious: their leader this week made himself credible and Ipsos Mori says he is exactly where Cameron was at the same stage. But it's still only half-time.</p>",
  "<p>The government's disastrous handling of the competition for the west coast main line franchise (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/03/virgin-rail-west-coast\" title=\"\">Virgin back on track in rail shambles</a>, 4&#xa0;October) is the latest in a long line of coalition cock-ups \u2013 but it also highlights all that is wrong with the UK's privatised rail system.</p> <p>Since privatisation in the 1990s, the cost of train travel in the UK has risen by 17% in real terms \u2013 compared with a&#xa0;7% drop in the cost of motoring. Fares are now some of the highest in Europe and the government's plan for a further 6.2% increase from January 2013 is the last straw for many commuters in my constituency.</p> <p>Thanks to higher interest payments to keep debts off the government balance sheet, and costs arising from fragmentation and the complex network of subcontractors, the cost to the public purse of running the railways has risen by 2 to 3 times since privatisation. Now taxpayers are told we must cough up \u00a340m in compensation to the four west coast bidders.</p> <p>What rail passengers want most of all is stability and value for money \u2013 not one unaccountable company snatching control from another with promises they may never deliver. So, instead of tinkering round the edges of a system that is not fit for purpose, the Greens are calling for an end to private ownership. Bringing the railways back into public hands could save over \u00a31bn a year of taxpayers' money \u2013 some of which could be spent on reducing fares. Britain was once world famous for its trail blazing and hugely successful railways. But unless they are returned to public ownership, we will struggle on with a fragmented, complex and often dysfunctional system that rips off passengers, harms the economy and fails the environment.<br><strong>Caroline Lucas</strong><br><em>MP for Brighton Pavilion, Green party</em></p> <p>\u2022 The rail franchise fiasco can come as no surprise if it follows the sort of procurement practices current in the \"reformed\" NHS. In Newcastle recently, the control of Grainger Medical Group, managed by the North of Tyne primary care trust (PCT), was contracted to Care UK. The process was managed by a separate company, the North East procurement service. The bids were anonymous.</p> <p>This means the PCT only became aware that the successful bid for Grainger was Care UK after the contract had been awarded. There was an outcry in protest at the appointment of a private company and at a lack of consultation. Information from the PCT revealed that, since there was no means to research track record or company structure of a bidder for such a contract, the only relevant information was what the bidder chose to submit.</p> <p>This seems insane and farcical. How do they know that the bids are from competent sources? What guarantees are there that the practice&#xa0;will be managed with the welfare of patients at its core? How does this match the avowed intent of the PCT to make quality of&#xa0;patient&#xa0;care central? The rail franchise collapse only emphasises the need for a thorough examination of all such processes.<br><strong>Martin Manasse</strong> <br><em>Newcastle upon Tyne</em></p> <p>\u2022 I have no detailed knowledge of the west coast franchise case, but it highlights a&#xa0;basic flaw in the current practice of contracting out, instead of relying on in-house public service providers. In the latter case, the essential criterion is that the decision should be the best available in the public interest, defensible as a proper use of taxpayers' money. But contracting-out decisions have to be justified under different, legal criteria, including the requirement to ensure that the interests of all parties are fully considered and safeguarded.</p> <p>No doubt the two sets of criteria overlap, and may often coincide. But judges are not best placed to decide on the public interest, and apply different rules whose effect is sometimes uncertain and unpredictable.</p> <p>For example in the past, the Department of&#xa0;Transport has lost judicial review cases on the grounds that the secretary of state's discretion must not be \"fettered\" by administrative rules \u2013 which seems to imply that a minister must decide each individual case on&#xa0;its merits, without regard for consistency.&#xa0;The creeping extension of judicial review has made life more difficult for public servants and ministers \u2013 but contracting out makes it substantially worse. <br><strong>Alan Bailey</strong><br><em>Permanent secretary, Department of Transport 1986-91</em></p> <p>\u2022 The previous minister of transport, Justine Greening, described the tender process for the west coast franchise as \"robust\". It is only because Richard Branson threatened to bring a high-court action to contest the awarding of the contract to FirstGroup that it has transpired that the process, far from being robust, is seriously flawed. The current transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, says that the fault lies with the civil servants charged with assessing the tenders. Consideration of other rail tenders has now been \"paused\". Does this cast doubt on the whole process by which civil servants assess high-value service provider contracts? Many are subsequently found to be seriously deficient in their delivery, such as those awarded to Atos, G4S, A4e and ALS (Court Translation Service). Numerous NHS services are currently being put up for tender on the open market. Can we be sure that these will go through a truly \"robust\" process?&#xa0; There will be no Richard Branson on hand to challenge the outcome.<br><strong>John Mills</strong> <br><em>Matlock, Derbyshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your editorial (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/03/rail-franchises-signal-failure-editorial\" title=\"\">A signal failure</a>, 4&#xa0;October) identifies the problem that caused the franchise to be let incorrectly as a process failure. This implies that all franchise applications were estimated according to the same process. But then we read that: \"First's revenue projections were based on a preposterous increase in journeys.\" It seems that the four shortlisted applicants were able to make their own projections of future events which affect journeys to be made in the future. If this is the case, why not recalculate all applications on each of the proposed future projections.

  "<p>David Cameron, who is often accused of taking a lackadaisical approach to the business of running the country, left nothing to chance this week.</p> <p>Downing Street's strict diary disciplinarians cleared a chunky slot on Tuesday afternoon to ensure that the prime minister could watch and digest Ed Miliband's speech to the Labour conference. Cameron, who regards the Labour leader as his greatest trump card on the grounds that Miliband is unlikely ever to connect to the British people, was impressed.</p> <p>\"It was a well-delivered speech,\" one No 10 source said of Miliband's bold attempt to march on to Cameron's territory by claiming the mantle of One Nation Toryism. \"That is the job of the leader of the opposition \u2013 you just need one hit.\"</p> <p>Downing Street does not believe, however, that this is what is known in Tory circles as a \"John Maples moment\". This is a reference to a leaked memo, written by the late Tory peer in 1994, which warned that the party would have a problem \"if Blair turns out to be as good as he looks\".</p> <p>The prime minister and George Osborne have decided that the speech does not alter their fundamental judgment about Miliband \u2013 and therefore does not call for a change in strategy. The speech did not, in their view, signal any shift in political direction, as Blair's election as Labour leader did in 1994, and they believe the speech started to unravel once Miliband pledged to join the TUC march against government cuts in London on 20 October.</p> <p>\"Ed Miliband was signalling right but turning left,\" one senior figure said. \"There has been quite a bit of unravelling. There was no substance to the speech.\"</p> <p>Tories will continue to claim Miliband's focus on spending more shows he has learned nothing from Labour's mistakes in office. \"The great thing about the speech was what he did not say,\" another senior figure said. \"He did not say: 'We get it, we spent too much and borrowed too much.' That is great news because it leaves a big, gaping hole in his agenda.\"</p> <p>Being armed with the careful analysis of Miliband's speech shows the advantage \u2013 or added pressure \u2013 the Conservative leader faces as the party stages the last of three party conferences, at Birmingham's ICC from Sunday.</p> <p>Fears remain in the party that there are deep flaws in Downing Street's operation. \"I do hope that Miliband's speech acts as a wake-up call for our people, who have become quite lazy,\" one well-placed Tory said. \"Many in No 10 say that the opinion polls [which give Labour a lead] do not matter because we will win. Therefore, we do not have to do the hard thinking.</p> <p>\"It really is amateur night. You should never underestimate your enemy. Ed Miliband did well and worked very hard on his speech.\"</p> <p>Tory critics, including many in government, believe a series of weaknesses have come into sharp relief in the past six months. There is a feeling that No 10 is sometimes run on a slapdash basis with poor central control. Miliband's claim that Cameron runs a \"back-of-the-envelope\" government struck a chord with many Tories.</p> <p>Cameron and Osborne have also failed to shake off their image as remote figures who are aloof to everyone bar their small inner circle. \"The prime minister would be surprised how people who are thought to be close really do not warm to them on a personal level,\" one source familiar with the workings of No 10 said. \"All the references to Eton at the morning meetings is alienating.\"</p> <p>This view was brought into sharp relief by the light treatment of Andrew Mitchell, the chief whip, who has escaped with a mild rebuke from the prime minister after he swore at armed police officers in Downing Street.</p> <p>The Tories announced on Thursday that Mitchell would not be attending the conference even though he is the party's only MP in Birmingham, in the Sutton Coldfield seat.</p> <p>\"Andrew does not want to be a distraction,\" one No 10 source said. One source said: \"You will not have to see Andrew Mitchell on television ever again.\"</p> <p>While Westminster gossip mongers love to focus on personality, Tories acknowledge that the overriding explanation for the less than perfect standing of the prime minister and chancellor is the state of the economy. \"The economy is beyond our control, though we could have made a better fist of communicating that point,\" one Tory said.</p> <p>But Osborne is still facing criticism for what some described as the \"cock-up\" over the budget when he failed to spot the political dangers in some of his revenue raising measures, designed to help pay for cutting the top rate of income tax, such as imposing a pasty tax and lowering the relief on charitable donations. \"George Osborne does bear some responsibility for the cock-up of the budget,\" the Tory said.</p> <p>One senior Labour strategist believes Osborne's decision to cut the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p, in the midst of a double-dip recession, was a major mistake.</p> <p>\"George Osborne has cratered the Tory brand with his tax cut,\" the Labour figure said. \"He is so obsessive about US politics, he drew up an economic strategy on a political timetable with his plan to eliminate the structural budget deficit over course of a parliament. The idea was that a recovery would come and then he would run the next election on an optimistic note in the way Ronald Reagan ran his Morning in America campaign in 1984. That will not happen.\"</p> <p>The Tories, unsurprisingly, believe this analysis is overblown. \"There are signs that the economy is beginning to turn,\" one minister said.</p> <p>Downing Street will try to adopt an upbeat approach on the economy, without falling into the classic trap of declaring the \"green shoots\" of recovery are emerging, as Cameron's former boss Norman Lamont did in 1991. The conference has been designed to have a \"festival feel\" with a series of simultaneous events taking place in addition to the usual format of the formal events in the hall and an endless round of fringe meetings.</p> <p>T he leadership will reach out to internal critics, who say Cameron looks rather too comfortable as a coalition prime minister, by setting aside a prized slot on the main stage for Stephen Gilbert, the party's head of campaigning.</p> <p>Gilbert, who used to run Lord Ashcroft's campaign for the Tories in marginal constituencies, will say the party will run a more tightly focused campaign in such seats. The party targeted 120 seats in 2010, prompting criticism that resources were spread too thinly. In 2015, there will be a smaller number of target seats because the party is banking on the benefit of incumbency in many of the seats it won in 2010. \"As well as running an effective air war, Stephen will show how plans are being laid for the ground war,\" one source said.</p> <p>The best laid plans can go awry, not least when the country's most popular politician is on the loose. Boris Johnson, whose ratings have soared since the Olympics, will make speeches on two consecutive days, on Monday and Tuesday.</p> <p>\"We are very relaxed,\" one No 10 source said. \"There are worse rivals to have \u2013 normally they are in the cabinet or sitting two rows behind you in the House of Commons.\"</p>",
  "<p>As I walked out of a noticeably dirty Hyatt hotel while on a book tour in San Francisco last week, I was startled by a major labor event with a well-executed picket line and loud, disciplined chanting. It became clear that the housekeeping staff and their union were asking customers to boycott Hyatt over a dispute of which I had been unaware.</p> <p>I received a tip to the story from Julia Wong of <a href=\"http://www.unitehere.org/\">Unite Here</a>, a coalition of union members in the hospitality industry, which asserts that Hyatt commonly exploits its workers. At first, housekeepers were calling for boycotts of individual Hyatt properties. But when Hyatt refused to address some of the concerns raised \u2013 such as health and safety, when the hotel chain led the opposition to a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/19/california-hotel-maids-bedsheets_n_850766.html\">California bill</a> that would have required hotels to use fitted sheets in order to ease the physical burden on cleaners \u2013 the effort ramped up to a global boycott. </p> <p>In July 2012, Unite Here and other groups, including the National Football Players' Association \u2013 whose representatives said that many players had been raised by hardworking women like the housekeepers who had joined the campaign \u2013 launched the escalated boycott, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/23/hyatt-hotels-boycott_n_1694828.html\">Hyatt Hurts</a>. The coalition already includes some serious players in the feminist and leftwing activist worlds like the National Organization of Women (NOW), Moveon.org and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hyatthurts.org/2012/07/global-boycott-of-hyatt-launched/\">Hyatt has been awarded the dubious title of</a> \"the Worst Hospitality Employer in America\" by the Hyatt Hurts website. Rather movingly, as the movement spread, workers in Hyatts in India, the UK, Israel and the Phillipines went on strike. This is a historic effort, because as globalization extends employers' power globally, it also strengthens the global counter-protest, or global boycott, by uniting workers across the world to organize successfully from the ground upwards.</p> <p>In interviews with the housekeepers, the issue of these women often being treated as if they are \"invisible\" came up again and again, as did the quantity of extremely hard work, sometimes injurious, that is expected of the mostly female, and mostly non-white, workers. As they pointed out, hotel guests rarely think about this, simply expecting vacuumed floors and dusted surfaces. But cleaning women and men typically perform heavy labor very quickly for a big chain such as Hyatt. In May, the federal authority, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), actually <a href=\"http://www.aflcio.org/Blog/Corporate-Greed/OSHA-Warns-Hyatt-on-Housekeeper-Injuries\">sent a letter to Hyatt management</a>, warning executives about the health risks of driving their cleaning people so ruthlessly (a letter that is considered a first in the industry).</p> <p>The Hyatt staff whom I interviewed describe the rapid pace of cleaning room after room, including the hard physical work like scrubbing bathrooms on one's hands and knees and lifting heavy mattresses. These and other strenuous moves increase the likelihood of back and knee injuries given the expected high room turnover.</p> <p>Jacob Tomsky, a desk clerk for a luxury hotel who has written a tell-all account of working in the hospitality industry, Heads in Beds: A Reckless Memoir of Hotels, Hustles and So-Called Hospitality, has great sympathy for housekeepers' work conditions:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"There is nothing easy about housekeeping. There is nothing easy about dealing with other people's filth and having to get on your knees to do it. There is nothing easy about scouring and spraying and polishing and getting on all fours to make sure there isn't a porno magazine under the bed skirt \u2026 There is nothing easy about being sexually harassed by guests. There is nothing easy about scrubbing a toilet on Christmas morning, believe me.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>When I contacted Hyatt about Unite Here's claims on health and safety, Doug Patrick, Hyatt's senior VP of human resources, responded:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Hyatt provides industry-leading wage and benefits packages, maintains an outstanding workplace safety record, and is a recognized leader in promoting a diverse workforce \u2026 It is because of our commitment to our associates that average tenure of our housekeepers at our North American properties is more than 12 years, with approximately half of our nearly 40,000 associates having worked with us for more than 10 years.</p> <p>\"Housekeeping can be a physical and difficult job. Contrary to Unite Here's assertions, our associates have the tools, resources and training they need to do great work.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Patrick also said that Hyatt's workplace safety record \"has been validated\" by the OSHA, and counter-claimed that OSHA investigations had been instigated by Unite Here \"as part of its ongoing campaign to pressure Hyatt to impose union membership on employees\".</p> <p>A second issue raised by Hyatt Hurts is that Hyatt has led the industry in union-busting and exploitative temp-work outsourcing. <a href=\"http://www.unitehere.org/presscenter/release.php?ID=4644\">A federal agency has issued</a> a complaint against two Hyatts in San Francisco for violating the law by implementing \"E-Verify\" \u2013 a practice that immigrant rights advocates say is riddled with errors and can be used by employers to intimidate immigrant workers.</p> <p>On the outsourcing charge, Hyatt's Doug Patrick stated:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"More than nine out of ten workers in US Hyatt hotels are Hyatt employees. On an as-needed basis, and like virtually all hotel management companies, Hyatt uses staffing companies to supplement certain functions at our hotels so we can respond effectively to fluctuations in business levels and can operate efficiently.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In San Francisco, I was appalled at the response a representative for Hyatt's management when I asked her to explain Hyatt's position on the striking workers.</p> <p>\"Those people don't even work here,\" she said through clenched lips. Which misses the point: of course, they don't work there \u2013 they are union brothers and sisters of those who do work there. That is what a union does, that is how it works: solidarity.</p> <p>What will be the outcome of the global boycott? Can these workers win?</p> <p>The odds are daunting: housekeeper staff are at the very bottom of the social hierarchy in the hospitality industry \u2013 the hidden hands that make travel comfortable and clean. They lack money, representation and clout. And as Hyatt continues to contract out temp work systematically, the chain is probably betting that even more desperate workers will quietly take their places.</p> <p>But what was obvious from talking to the workers outside the Hyatt Embarcadero \u2013 obvious in a <a href=\"http://www.calaborfed.org/index.php/site/author_archive/1131\\\">union-busting age</a> during a presidential election where one candidate is committed to gutting labor \u2013 is the conviction that it is \"the union makes [them] strong\". Thousands of \"invisible\" women and men uniting around the world may be able to do what one woman or man kneeling alone, scrubbing a bathroom floor can never accomplish.</p> <p>I, for one, was persuaded that I no longer wished to spend another night, or one more tourism dollar, in a Hyatt hotel until a group like Unite Here can give the chain a clean bill of health.</p>",
  "<p>You would never call Sally Potter a ginge. Not just because you wouldn't dare. Or because it would be like squirting ketchup over a&#xa0;slice of Poilane, or programming a double bill of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120275/\" title=\"\">The Tango Lesson</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146637/streetdance-2-3d\" title=\"\">StreetDance 2 3D</a>. You wouldn't even risk&#xa0;\"strawberry blonde\". The famed Potter mane is a big mingle of lemon and silver and cinnamon, which shimmers, Titian-ish.</p> <p>Yet there is little doubt that she is, in some sense, Ginger, the carrot-topped hero of her new film. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/07/ginger-and-rosa-review\" title=\"\">Ginger &amp; Rosa</a> is about baby-boomer best buddies, born on the same day, whose friendship in postwar London comes under strain when Rosa (Alice Englert) starts shagging Ginger's glamorous academic dad (Alessandro Nivola), freshly separated from her housewife mum (Christina Hendricks, doing downtrodden). The plot might not be autobiography, but Ginger's activist roots, social conscience, poetic heart, and parts of that barnet, are all Potter.</p> <p>\"Every story to some degree has to draw on personal experience,\" she says. \"Magpie-like, you scavenge, and then you transform until it is its own world. But I did grow up during the Cuban missile crisis. I was on Aldermaston marches from the age of 10, I was very, very aware of the nuclear threat and I&#xa0;grew up in a leftwing, outsider, academic milieu. But it's a fiction.\"</p> <p>In fact the friends are meant to be 16&#xa0;going on 17, but the actor who plays Ginger, Elle Fanning, picking up <a href=\"http://weblogs.variety.com/thevote/2012/10/fanning.html\" title=\"\">much-deserved Oscar buzz</a>, was just 13&#xa0;at the time of the shoot \u2013 as was Potter in 1962. Ginger is riven with worry about the threat of annihilation; a threat the film is careful to justify, if not quite vindicate.</p> <p>\"I dreamed about it most nights,\" says Potter. \"I had recurring nightmares. There'd be three minutes' warning and what could I do to save people, running hither and thither? Now we've got a much more creeping feeling of world destruction through climate change and so on. Not that feeling of imminent total doom. And it wasn't that long since the second world war. So there was a handed-down sense of apocalypse.\"</p> <p>She coped by casting off inertia. \"Fear is essentially a state of paralysis. As soon as you become active, you feel as if you're transforming your fear.\" So it's not so much about altruism? \"No, more a feeling of connectedness with something broader and wider. The assumption that you can do something, paradoxically, takes a lot of confidence, even if that confidence is mixed in with fear and apprehension.\"</p> <p>Potter is all about direct action. She left home at 16 to take backroom jobs at the BBC while making shorts as part of the London Film-Makers' Co-op. \"I&#xa0;thought I was adult at 14. Looking back, I can see how vulnerable I must have been.\"</p> <p>In the flesh, she seems composed, politely forthright. She sits in front of the window at her studio, all plants and art, wood floor and grand piano, at&#xa0;the top of a short tower block in Hoxton, east London. The floor below houses her production company's offices. Above, pigeons hop across the roof, which sounds as if it is made of tin. The creaks, the view, the dinky mezzanine, suggest a bohemian stateroom in a slightly rickety ocean liner.</p> <p>Her films sport proud Potter thumbprints, from her debut, the all-female historical rewrite<a href=\"html\" title=\"\"> The Gold Diggers</a> (1983), in which the star, Julie Christie, was paid the same as the lowliest gaffer, to <a href=\"http://reframecollection.org/films/film?Id=371\" title=\"\">I&#xa0;am an Ox, I am a Horse, I am a Man, I&#xa0;am a Woman (1988)</a>, a documentary about female practitioners of Soviet cinema. They are as uncompromising as their author, the same mix of thoughtful and flamboyant; high-strung tub-thumpers, always bracing, rarely boring.</p> <p>But by far her biggest hit was 20 years ago: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/77651/orlando\" title=\"\">Orlando</a>, an adaptation, starring Tilda Swinton, of the Virginia Woolf novel about a woman who flipflops through time and gender. Right through her career, Potter has snagged some surprisingly big names, yet even the likes of 2000's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/86382/man.who.cried\" title=\"\">The Man Who Cried</a>, with Johnny Depp, Cate Blanchett and Christina Ricci, was moderately received. Then came <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/103299/yes\" title=\"\">Yes</a> (2003), a multicultural romance in iambic pentameter. Then Rage (2009), a digital, mostly monologue murder mystery with Jude Law and Judi Dench; the UK's first mobile-phone premiere.</p> <p>\"It didn't do quite what I wanted to do. It stumbled through the gate,\" she says. \"So I then wanted to do something that was not obsessed with its form.\" And it is Ginger &amp; Rosa's lack of self-consciousness, despite its personal origins, that makes it by far her most mainstream to date. The canvas has been opened out \u2013 she has recruited Robbie Ryan, Andrea Arnold's cinematographer \u2013 and the pace is kept snappy, thanks perhaps to new editor Anders Refn (Lars von Trier's longtime colleague, father of Nicolas Winding).</p> <p>It is a film of warmth, even naivety. Spending so much time with her young stars was very affecting, says Potter. \"The depth of relationship you go into \u2013 it's more intense than any other process that I know; it completely transcends gender, age, nationality. You have to leapfrog over those things and connect in a very, very deep way. When I see teenage girls walking around now, I feel very loving towards them and their struggles.\" Does she ever approach them? \"No, but my hugs for my goddaughters were possibly extra-specially strong.\"</p> <p>Ginger &amp; Rosa distils the intensity of young friendship, and its covert, almost romantic secrecies. \"There were very few spaces you could talk about the big things,\" she says, remembering her own nostalgically, \"so you ended up sitting on the end of a bath with the door locked looking in the mirror and talking about the bomb or whatever.\" She feels the legitimate concerns of the young can still be belittled. \"I think there's a terrible over-psychologising of&#xa0;people's anxiety. Maybe it's the children who are really awake? People talk about the tyranny of children \u2013 I&#xa0;think that's rubbish. You can still be capable of insight and you're certainly worthy of&#xa0;respect.\"</p> <p>Yet Potter is at pains to be optimistic. \"It was so glorious to see how much Occupy had learned from all these previous political movements. To have a free university tent, a therapy tent, the food, the safety patrols, equal rights of speaking at assembly! This microcosm of an ideal world concept. Absolutely brilliant. Fantastically good. It's always best to have a philosophical position of hope and therefore that activism is worthwhile.\"</p> <p>There are many reasons Ginger &amp; Rosa seems likely to go down better with the public than some of her previous films. One, which may be overshadowed by Fanning's almost frightening ability, is Nivola's turn as Ginger's father, Roland, the former conscientious objector baffled by the liberal ire in the face of his new relationship. Other characters have arcs; Roland has contradictions. On the&#xa0;one hand he justifies the affair as political action fighting mindless obedience: \"I've broken the rules, all the rules, because someone has to say no.\" On the other, he protests that love must be simply surrendered to.</p> <p>Potter sympathises. \"Falling in love is a kind of&#xa0;madness. People feel that the feeling is hugely significant, as if it is beyond the rational or kindness or anything.\"</p> <p>But how do his two arguments square? She&#xa0;pauses. \"I think for a lot of the extreme rationalists there was&#xa0;an enormous dose&#xa0;of romanticism, too. They're wrestling with their own self-image. People draw&#xa0;a portrait of themselves that often leaves out the key thing, which inadvertently reveals what they really are or what they can't face in&#xa0;themselves.\"</p> <p>Maybe Ginger, then, is a red herring. Potter, like Roland, does a lot of wrestling with the personal and the political. Her career has, in some ways, been a succession of self-portraits, but she made a <a href=\"http://sallypotter.com/passion-obsession-and-insomnia/#more-389\" title=\"\">bonafide two-minute one </a>back in 2007, shot in an insomniac fog,&#xa0;then posted on her blog. Woozy footage of her face with no makeup, pot&#xa0;plants, computer, cooker, gets a knackered, fretful voiceover. \"My mind says: Get up Sally, it doesn't matter if you're tired.\" It goes on, audio distorting. Then, at the end, it says: \"And there's this guy \u2026\" Potter is not afraid to reveal key things, even if they are unappealing.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Ginger &amp; Rosa is released in the UK on 19 October</em></p>",

No one could have used it more effectively than their two families. And, like the Egyptian lawyer and artist Abdul Bary, they are widely known now by sections of the community. The sense of justice denied is already palpable, and will only grow.</p> <p>Meanwhile, these last frenzied days of government attempts to block the demarches by some of Britain's finest lawyers against the extradition has amounted to a showdown of values that should shake the UK legal system.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 October 2012. The original said that, apart from Adel Abdul Bary, one other person, Ahmed Ghailani, had been tried on charges relating to the 1998 bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

  "<p>Jordan is facing new political uncertainty after King Abdullah decided to dissolve parliament and call early elections against a background of rising tensions over long-delayed reforms.</p> <p>The move was announced on the eve of what had been billed as a potentially violent confrontation between the Islamist-led opposition and government supporters at rival rallies in Amman on Friday.</p> <p>Late on Thursday the pro-government side decided to postpone its rally, apparently on official advice. Opposition supporters had accused the authorities of deliberately organising a showdown.</p> <p>The Islamic Action Front, the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, is expecting to get 50,000 supporters out for the biggest opposition protest yet seen in the western-backed monarchy.</p> <p>The IAF has insisted that it will boycott the polls to protest against the lack of reform. It is demanding a parliamentary system where the prime minister is elected rather than chosen and dismissed by the king.</p> <p>\"We are talking about a new phase after 20 months of continued popular protests and unwillingness to listen to our demands for reform,\" Zaki Bani Rusheid, the deputy head of the Muslim Brotherhood, told Reuters. \"We are calling for real reforms that restore power to Jordanian people.\"</p> <p>Under Jordan's constitution the cabinet must resign within a week of parliament's dissolution. That means the king will be appointing another prime minister \u2013 his fifth since the Arab spring began. Jordanians joke wryly about the king playing musical chairs but doing little else.</p> <p>Changes to the electoral system have failed to satisfy critics, who complain that it remains unrepresentative and weighted against the estimated 60% of Jordanians who are of Palestinian origin.</p> <p>A study by Fikra, an online forum that aims to support Arab democrats \"in their struggle with authoritarians\", shows that the governate of Kerak, which has a population of 200,000, is represented by 10 MPs, while the 1 million people in Zarqa are represented by only 11 MPs. This unfair distribution of seats between governorates prevents hundreds of thousands from participating in the election.</p> <p>Jordan has been largely spared the drama of events elsewhere in the region over the past two turbulent years. Demonstrations in March 2011 were contained and protests since have been restricted to outlying areas. Unusually for the Arab world, the government has allowed demonstrations to take place without the use of lethal force.</p> <p>Talk of reform has now been accompanied by four changes of prime minister. The last prime minister, Awn Khasawneh, resigned when the palace insisted he was moving too slowly. The other view is that he was getting too cosy in talks with the IAF. The outgoing incumbent, Fayez Tarawneh, was only ever seen as a stopgap.</p> <p>The IAF has been emboldened by the successes of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Tunisia and by the prominent role it is playing in the uprising in Syria.</p> <p>In private, Jordan's western friends are becoming increasingly nervous about the slow pace of change and the prickliness of the palace in the face of opposition. Expectations of change have risen as criticism of the monarchy has become bolder. The king has also been having unaccustomed problems with his most loyal constituency, the east Jordanian tribes, as the cash to pay for public sector jobs runs out.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 October 2012 because the original said King Abdullah of Jordan sacked the country's last prime minister, Awn Khasawneh.</p>",
  "<p>Ira Sach's new film, <a href=\"http://keepthelightsonfilm.com/\" title=\"\">Keep the Lights On</a>, follows the decade-long relationship between two men who meet on a New York phone-sex line in 1998. It includes explicit sex and copious drug use; it also includes domestic squabbles, quotidian work hassles and meals with friends, straight and gay. No one comes out or dies, and everything is shown with the same fluid, elegant transparency. \"I feel very few films convey the communal nature of urban life these days, the lack of boundaries,\" Sachs says. \"'Those are the gays over there' \u2013 that's not how we live any more.\"</p> <p>Keep the Lights On is at once very good and conspicuously ordinary. Like several other recent features about gay characters by gay directors, it deploys naturalism \u2013 often shooting handheld in found locations and using performances that smack of improvisation \u2013 to tell a story rooted in psychological specificity, but with universal resonance. Andrew Haigh's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/141120/weekend\" title=\"\">Weekend</a>, released last year to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/03/weekend-film-review\" title=\"\">widespread acclaim</a>, used a similar approach with its story of two guys hanging out after meeting in a Nottingham club. And Travis Mathews's forthcoming <a href=\"http://www.iwantyourlovethemovie.com/\" title=\"\">I Want Your Love</a> explores a twentysomething San Francisco artist's social circle in a comparable style. It's a peculiarly powerful mode that represents a welcome shift in queer cinema \u2013 an embrace of the real.</p> <p>Substantial representations of unambiguously gay characters were rare on film before the 1980s. Just as shoots were showing through \u2013 1982's <a href=\"www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaowR67NICg]\" title=\"\">Making Love</a> was a watershed \u2013 the Aids crisis derailed gay life and its representation. The on-screen reaction of the late 80s and 90s came to be known as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/09/3\" title=\"\">New Queer Cinema</a>: film-makers such as Gus Van Sant, Todd Haynes and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/02/gregg-araki-back-with-a-kaboom\" title=\"\">Gregg Araki</a> responded to the threats of terminal illness, political disenfranchisement and social exclusion with expressionistic films in which poetry met porn, genre pastiche rubbed up against surrealism and apocalypse came in a pop-culture package. Their radical instability reflected their context.</p> <p>In the 1990s, reality stabilised thanks to breakthroughs in Aids treatment and progress in legal recognition. Political and aesthetic sensibilities began to take a back seat to story and character. Challenges such as being openly gay or dealing with HIV, though still present, were more readily absorbed into conventional film-making. For Hollywood, the weepy problem movie was the form of choice (hello, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/51216/philadelphia\" title=\"\">Philadelphia</a>!) but low-budget, gay-produced indies settled on the romantic comedy. The success of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7O6pxHR7M\" title=\"\">Jeffrey</a> (US, 1995) and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf0fvLprGk4\" title=\"\">Beautiful Thing</a> (UK, 1996) set a template for upbeat, accessible features for which LGBT film festival and home-video audiences constituted a viable market. Arguably, too viable: more titles were turned out, formula set in, then mediocrity; 2006 saw the production of a parody of such films, <a href=\"http://www.anothergaymovie.com\" title=\"\">Another Gay Movie</a>, which in turn spawned <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1051981/\" title=\"\">Another Gay Sequel</a>. Assimilationist works for assimilationist times.</p> <p>There are exceptions to these generalisations, and huge differences between New Queer Cinema's activist expressionism and the generic populism that succeeded it. But both could be seen in terms of a reality deficit. \"You can look at queer film-making in the past 20 years and say we often reverted to using metaphor as a way of telling our stories and avoided the stories themselves,\" says Sachs. He has done the opposite: Keep the Lights On is autobiographical, revisiting in often excruciating detail the relationship between Sachs and his former partner, a crack-addicted book editor. Compulsion and codependency, deception and desperation lace the narrative, but there are no heroes or villains and no melodrama. \"I wanted to invert the secretive nature of the story by making a film that was very open,\" Sachs says, faithful to the small, telling details of these experiences.</p> <p>There is an element of wish-fulfilment to romantic comedies, suggests Haigh, \"of wanting to see happy, well-adjusted lives on screen\". Mathews agrees: \"Like any minority group, when you start making your own media it might be really exciting just to see representations of yourself,\" he says. \"I don't want to sound like an asshole, but a lot of movies got greenlit because of representation regardless of the quality of the work. People are hungry now for stories that respect their level of intelligence and their actual experience.\"</p> <p>Weekend and I Want Your Love developed independently, but simultaneously. \"I suppose there was a frustration that came from the kind of queer films we were seeing at festivals and wanting to do something that we felt represented the real lives of gay people,\" Haigh says. \"They were showing a world I knew nothing about \u2013 a superficial, frothy romcom look at gay life. You want to be able to describe the gay experience in all its complexity without worrying that your film has to represent a community.\"</p> <p>These film-makers seek to describe the experience of being queer today through stories that resonate beyond that context. There can be a perception among straight people that the troubles of non-straights are over, at least in the west. Sachs, however, stresses the lifelong consequences of growing up queer. \"Individually, we're still affected on a day-to-day level by having discovered our sexuality with fear and shame and self-hatred. My film documents that. On the other hand, my identity is not questioned on a daily basis in the way that it was 20 years ago. I'm not so troubled by identity, so nor are my films.\"</p> <p>Haigh too says: \"It was important to show [in Weekend] that there are still lots of subtle things we have to overcome. No gay person would say everything's fine now. But we can move away from the big issues and go a few layers deeper, which makes the films more accessible to a lot of people because they're about more universal issues. These characters' struggles aren't just about being gay \u2013 they're trying to connect with someone, to sort out what to do with their lives.\"</p> <p>These films share a frank approach to sex. The intimate scenes in Weekend and Keep the Lights On highlight how perverse it is that most films about couples neglect this aspect of relationships. \"I wanted to depict sexual behaviour as it is,\" says Sachs. \"It's a part of everyday behaviour, even if people often compartmentalise it. There's a continuity of experience in the film.\"</p> <p>\"If you're trying to do an honest depiction of a relationship, sex is part of that,\" says Haigh. \"There have been a lot of queer films with sex in them and a lot of it has been for titillation or out of happiness that we can show gay sex on screen at all. For me, it's part of the story you're trying to tell rather than a case of trying to shoehorn sex scenes in for their own sake.\"</p> <p>Mathews's feature has more \u2013 and more graphic \u2013 sex scenes than Haigh's or Sachs's. The sex in I Want Your Love is plentiful, explicit and unsimulated but also illuminating in terms of numerous characters' relationships with one another. \"There's so much communication, so much information exchanged between two people when they're having or attempting to have sex,\" he says. \"It surprises me it's not played with more as a story or character device.\"</p> <p>Mathews had already explored sex as subject matter in a series of documentary shorts called <a href=\"http://travisdmathews.com/video\" title=\"\">In Their Room</a>, which helped him secure funding for I&#xa0;Want Your Love from porn studio <a href=\"http://www.nakedsword.com/\" title=\"\">NakedSword</a>. Given the near-impossibility of finding mainstream backing for a film with such hardcore content, he had few qualms about getting into bed with the company. \"I knew the people involved and how much creative freedom I was going to have,\" he says, \"and it was an extension of what I was already doing [with In Their Room]. I knew I was going to deliver something that was going to provoke arguments over whether it was art or porn, and I hoped it would encourage other projects within the porn world that pushed those boundaries.\" It remains to be seen whether that will happen.</p> <p>Not that gay directors have a monopoly on explicit sex, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/26/steve-mcqueen-shame-nc17-rating\" title=\"\">Steve McQueen</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shia-labeouf-lars-von-trier-nymphomaniac-363931\" title=\"\">Lars von Trier</a>'s recent projects show; James Franco <a href=\"http://www.indiewire.com/article/exclusive-travis-mathews-teams-up-with-james-franco-for-re-imagining-of-lightning-rod-gay-film-cruising\" title=\"\">has approached Mathews about collaborating</a>. Indeed, Sachs stresses the importance of non-gay influences on his work: as well as Fassbinder, Pasolini and Jarman, he was inspired by Cassavetes, Dogme and Derek Cianfrance's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/138423/blue-valentine\" title=\"\">Blue Valentine</a>; Haigh also cites the influence of recent straight \"low-budget American cinema trying to do something more realistic\".</p> <p>In a queer context, Mathews suggests these movies are \"picking up where things like Making Love left off. Aids put things on hold \u2013 turned things urgent and political and experimental. We're going back to measuring everyday life.\" Strikingly provocative slice-of-life antecedents include Ron Peck and Paul Hallam's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8S1OTRHctY\" title=\"\">Nighthawks</a> (UK, 1978) and Frank Ripploh's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/82072/taxi-zum-klo\" title=\"\">Taxi Zum Klo</a> (West Germany, 1980).</p> <p>There is nothing new under the sun. But in uncertain times for both cinema as an art form and queerness in mainstream culture, it is heartening to see talented, ambitious film-makers embracing the real \u2013 mess and all. As Haigh puts it: \"We're not afraid now to tell stories about flawed gay individuals who are fully rounded characters and just as fucked up about life as everyone else.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Keep the Lights On is at the London film festival on 16 and 17 October and is released in the UK on 2 November. Weekend is out on DVD and Blu-ray. I Want Your Love will be released next year.</em></p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Good evening. Paul will be here soon enough but while you wait, here's Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas on why he is bemused by the Europa League's unpopularity. No, really. Enjoy.</p> <blockquote> <p>Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas has admitted he is baffled by the Europa League's constant unpopularity in England.</p> <p>The Tottenham Hotspur manager's career took off in 2010-11 when he won the competition with Porto, the climax of a season in which he claimed four trophies, leading to him replacing Carlo Ancelotti at Chelsea.</p> <p>\"The profile of the competition is raised in other countries, but not England. I don't understand it,\" Villas-Boas said in Greece ahead of his team's Group J game against Panathinaikos on Thursday. \"I'm also not in a position to criticise others managers' approach to the competition.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/03/andre-villas-boas-europa-league\">Continued here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong><br>Hats off to Andre Villas-Boas for coming up the radical of idea of actually trying to win this tournament. Will such an approach ever catch on among England's top sides? Here be the line-ups:</p> <p><strong>Panathinaikos:</strong> Kamezis; Seitaridis, Pinto, Triantafyllopoulous, Vyntra; Marinos, Vitolo, Christodoupoulos, Zeca, Owusu-Abeyie; Toch\u00e9, <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Kotsolis, Chouchomis, Sissoko, Mavrias, Lagos, Formaroli, Barabrouses </p> <p><strong>Spurs:</strong> Lloris; Walker, Caulker, Dawson, Vertonghen; Lennon, Huddlestone, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Bale; Dempsey; Defoe<br><strong>Subs:</strong> Cudicini, Gallas, Sigurdsson, Falqu\u00e9, Sandro, Townsend, Mason</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>5.55pm: Here's what you need to know about Pana: they're a shambles. Financially they're on their knees and been forced to sell several of their best players during the summer; and that has been reflected in their form - they were beaten 3-0 by Maribor in their first match in this tournament and they are currently 12th in the 16-team Greek top flight, having won one of five matches so far (and lost to second-from-bottom Panthrakikos Komotin). Nevertheless, they still have amazing support, as proven by the scenes that greet the players upon their arrival on the pitch. Money may be desperately tight in Greece right now but there's a large and exuberant crowd in the stadium. Let's hope their fun spirit is rewarded with a fine game.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> AS Spurs get the game going, the camera pans around the stadium to reveal that it is, in fact, very far from full. Still, those who have forked out for tickets are creating a pleasant din. \"AVB trying to win it? He's playing his 4th choice goalkeeper!\" quips Matt Dony.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> A strong start by Spurs, as Bale makes a trademark gallop down the left and then fires in a tremendous cross that Pinto sticks behind for a corner. Pana fail to deal with that corner and as the ball bounces around the box, Defoe lashes a shot that bounces off Pinto's arm - Tottenham howl for a penalty, the ref ignores them</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Pana are palpably a rabble and Spurs are leading them on a merry dance. It is only a question of time before the visitors take the lead.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Vertonghen is already looking enterprising down the left; which raises the question: how many better left flanks are there in Europe than Vertonghen and Bale? \"Where is Adebayor?\" demands Dave Heffernan. \"They must be paying him large wages to not even make the bench?\" He has a hamstring injury but might be back by this weekend.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Huddlestone should enjoy this: he is being given plenty of time in central midfield to spray the ball about, though he has yet to properly avail of that room.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> That was better from Huddlestone. He spotted Walker's burst down the right and dinked a perfect ball through for the full-back, who collected it nicely but then miscued his shot from the edge of the area.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> \"Watching the game and trying very hard to feel a sense of excitement. Bring back the glory days of Uefa and games over two legs!\" booms Houro Loris. \"Happy to see Lloris play though, he has had a few terrific years and I can't understand why on earth he agreed to come Tottenham without first checking he would get Premiere League action. Amateurism and a poor agent would be the first reasons coming to mind. And AVB trauma at Chelsea when he tried to 'prepare for the future'.\" This Lloris storm is so much hooey: he will get plenty of Premier League action - Brad Friedel is 41, for crying out loud. Plus, Lloris could do with firming up his cross-collection qualities before being cast into the a league featuring Stoke, West Ham, etc. And on that note, Lloris surges off his line to collect a decent cross from Seitaridis!</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 waltzes past three and then serves Dempsey, who plays it back to Huddlestone, who is now trying a little too hard to dissect the defence with one ball, and sends his latest over-ambitious effort straight out of play. \"I need some guidance,\" confesses Timothy Smith. \"I have adopted Arsenal as my EPL team. I know we are supposed to hate Spurs, but they just hired my favorite player: Clint Dempsey. Is it OK if I root for Spurs when they are not playing Arsenal?\" Tim, Tim, Tim ... there are no rules: you can root for whoever the hell you want. Except John Terry.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> That's as trong run by Owusu-Abeyie (remember him?), even if Bale put in a worryingly feeble challenge. Fortunately for Spurs, Vertonghen came across to cut out the danger.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Dempsey curls a 25-yard freekick just wide.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Tottenham are still pretty much in control of this, right up to the opposing box, where their shortage of ideas has meant Pana have rarely been exposed. \"You may have missed it, but the Guardian had a pretty good MBM on the Obama/Romney debate last night,\" gushes Timothy Smith. \"It is too bad about Big Bird.\" Yes, I did miss that, but I am slightly puzzled by the love for Big Bird - he was always such a drip (although far more likeable than that Elmo fraud): the real heroes of Sesame Street were Ernie, Oscar and The Count. RIP.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Pana are showing some gumption. They bound forward gamely when they get the chance ... but their latest counter-attack comes to an end when Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 robs the ball and plays a shrewd pass through to Lennon, whose shot from 20 yards is pitiful. \"Surely no one in England 'roots' for anybody!\" storms Jon Tumbridge, who just can't let them rules go. Besides, perhaps Timothy Smith is not from England but rather from, you know, somewhere on the other 98% of the earth, which can't all be bad.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Christodouplous tonks a 27-yard freekick into the wall. Moments later Walker thoughtlessly concedes a freekick. A chance for Lloris to show off those exemplary cross-collection skills again? Yes, the man's a natural.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Lloris hurtles off his line to intercept a through-ball from Owusu-Abeyie before the striker could get there. It might not be a bad thing for Tottenham if the Greeks score around about now: the apparent bluntness of their hosts seems to have lulled Spurs into complacency - a rel lack of urgency has contaiminated their play.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Freekick to Spurs on the left. \"Don't forget Guy Smiley!\" pleads Diarmuid Daly in reference to the comments on 23 min. \"He could teach this generation's smarmy gameshow host morons a thing or two.\" Too right: check <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ex3leQNaOg\">this out</a>.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Pana 0-1 Spurs (Dawson 34')</strong> Huddlestone floats the freekick towards the near post, where Dawson rises well and sends an elegant header into the far corner! AVB has made him captain for tonight and there he led by example.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> Bale is allowed to run from mid-way to the edge of the box before having a pop. Karnezis pushes it behind for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Spurs are threatening a second goal now. Huddlestone and Bale have both forced decent saves from the keeper in the last couple of minutes. \"Eh, you forgot Grover on that list of Sesame Street heroes,\" protests Rory Gleeson. \"He was a true gent.\" Yes, he was. And he knew that anything is possible when you smell like a monster and know the meaning of the word 'on'.\"</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> Bale booked for a clumsy tackle on Seitaridis, who has been Pana's best performer so far, raiding down the right to reasonable effect.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Lloris fumbles a cross! Seitaridis clipped one in from the right, and the keeper jumped for it under mild pressure from Toch\u00e9 ... and he dropped it! But luckily for Lloris, no one was on hand to take advantage and he was able to pounce on it at the second attempt.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> That was quite easy for Spurs, who have established a lead that looks unassailable without over-exerting themselves. Help themselves to another goal and AVB will have a perfect chance to rest a couple of players. I'd also like to see him give a run-out to Falqu\u00e9, of whom I've seen little.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p>Half-time chitchat: \"I'm an American soccer fan,\" admits Daniel Stauss. which means that I'm supposed to think that everything Clint Dempsey does is better than anyone's ever done it before, unless of course Landon Donovan did it first, but there was something so petulant about his move from Fulham that I'm a little disgusted with the guy. Mostly because the EPL does petulant transfer snits better than anyone, and Deuce let the whole country down by not fleeing across an ocean and getting in a little golf.\"</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Pana change: Marinos off, Sissoko on.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Huddlestone sizes up a freekick from almost the same position from the one that led to the first goal (except at the other end, obviously). He producs another good delivery but a Tottenham player had ventured offside so Pana get a chance to relieve the pressure, for now.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Beautiful ball from Vertonghen to Defoe, who, alas, had strayed offside. If he's waited a nanosecond he would have been clean through on goal.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Owusu-Abeyie canters down the left, Walker having been caught out of position. The Ghanaian looks up in search of a colleague to aim for in the middle but, without an obvious target, then decides to just whack the ball across the face of goal. Dawson stretches out a leg (one of his own, happily) to divert it behind for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Dempsey slides a pass through for Defoe, whose first touch is good, as is his second, but then he blazes his shot over from 17 yards.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> \"Solid defending by Walker to pinch the ball off Sissoko just as the Ivorian seemed set to shoot from 15 yards. \"While the game looks OK on TV, the many sections of empty seats in the Athens Olympic stadium provide a sobering sneak preview of what West Ham's matchdays will look like once they move to Stratford,\" reckons Dan Hamilton. \"Apart from derbies with Millwall, of course.\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Dempsey has a ping from 25 yards. Easy save for the keeper.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> What the heck are Atletico Bilbao up to? They've left Llorente out again and are currently 3-0 down to Sparta Prague! Elsewhere , Videoton are beating Sporting Lisbon by the same score, while Helsingborgs 0 whom Celtic beat to get to the Champions League group stages - are leading 2-0 against Sctheve McClaren's Dutch table-toppers Twente.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> I won't lie to you, at least not right now: this match is trying the patience. Tottenham could be out of sight if they were more bothered. But they're not, which, I suppose, means there is still a little intrigue in the game, if not much action.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Bale tries to liven things up with a shot from 25 yards. It wobbles wide.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Spurs substitution: AVB is trying to lift his team with a change: off trots Dempsey, on bounds Sigurdsson.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Toch\u00e9 blems a 30-yard freekick over the bar. Spurs have become so indolent that they deserve to concede but this mob don't look capable of punishing them.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> That was Jermaine Defoe at his best! Well, right up until his shot, which was deflected behind for a corner. But he created the space for himself beautifully and then feinted and darted his to the edge of the box before his drive was turned behind. The corner came to nought.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Vyntra booked for pulling over Lennon as the little winger skipped past him. Freekick to the right of the Pana's box ...</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Spurs substitution: before the free-kick can be taken, AVB withdraws Lennon and introduces Townsend.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Bale rolls the freekick to Siguardsson, who lazily lumps it into the out-rushing defender.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p>GOAL! Pana 1-1 Spurs (Toch\u00e9 77') Spurs are finally punished for their slackness! Seitaridis, who has been Pana's best player all night, splits the defence with a superb pass from the right and Toch\u00e9, having dashed between Dawson and Caulker, pokes it past Lloris!</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Buoyed by their against-the-odds goal, Pana are now pushing for a second. And they've won a freekicx on the edge of the box thanks to a foul by Walker.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Spurs substitution: Huddlestone off, Sandro on.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Tottenham's slackness persists: they could actually lose this, which would be quite a feat. Meanwhile, John Willough has a theory as to why Atletico Bilbao are tanking at the moment. \"Marcelo Bielsa is sulking after his row with Llorente at training recently, and so left him out of the team. The rest of the team is sulking because now they have to get some goals themselves instead of just giving Llorente the ball and letting him get on with it. Llorente is now sulking in the stands.\" Having said that, they've pulled it back to 3-1 against Sparta Prague.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Pana change: Christodoulpoulous off, thankfully, and Mavrias on.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Spurs scrounge a corner. Bale swings it in ... Caulker nuts it over from close range, under pressure from the goalkeeper, who is given a freekick for absolutely nothing. The protection given too keepers is ridiculous.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Pana fans appear to be belting out Culture Club's Chamleon, perhaps because their goal was karmic punishment for Spurs' sluggishness.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>90+1 min:</strong> Spurs are finishing on the back foot here and find themselves throwing their bodies in front of Greek shots to cling on to a draw ...</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>90+2 min:</strong> OK&lt; not totally on the back foot: Bale scampers down the right and sends in a fine cross ... but no one was there to take advantage.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>90+3 min:</strong> It's all over. That was shoddy by Spurs, who never got into full match mode and eased off even further after taking the lead. They ended up clinging on for a point against a team they could have beaten by several goals. The upshot is that they still haven't put in many convincing 90-minute displays under AVB. \"Muppets,\" sums up SImon McMahon, in keeping with tonight's riff.</p>",

The fellow on stage said he didn't know anything about that.\"</p> <p>The confident, fired-up appearance by Obama was in stark contrast to his performance in the debate when he seemed disengaged, and at time frustrated as Romney batted away attacks on his policies.</p> <p>In one key exchange at the start, Obama said Romney was planning $5tn of tax cuts and had not explained how he was going to pay for those without increasing the deficit. Romney flat-out denied this was his policy.</p> <p>But independent analysts have said the tax cuts he is proposing would total almost $5tn over 10 years, and that it would be \"mathematically impossible\" to pay for that solely by stopping tax breaks for high-income individuals.</p> <p>Later, during a section on healthcare, Romney insisted that he had an alternative plan to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions were not discriminated against by health insurance companies. But after the debate, senior adviser Eric Fehrnstrom conceded that it would be down to individual states to introduce legislation to protect people with pre-existing conditions.</p> <p>The Democrats are planning to hold Romney to account on these and other issues, Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod, told reporters in a conference call on Thursday morning.</p> <p>\"Governor Romney gave a good performance and we give him credit for that,\" Axelrod said. \"The problem is that none of it was rooted in fact.\" Describing Romney as \"devoid of honesty\", he also accused the Republican of lying over his claim that he would regulate Wall Street.</p> <p>As the Obama team conducted its post-mortem, his campaign advisers faced questions about why Obama had appeared tired and uninterested, and about his failure to match Romney's aggression.</p> <p>Axelrod admitted that Democratic supporters would have been disappointed that Obama had not raised strong issues such as the Republican position on women's rights, or the secret video showing Romney disparaging 47% of voters as freeloaders or his record as chief executive of the investment fund Bain Capital. Axelrod said the president had not wanted the debate to turn into a slugfest that would have alienated the millions of television viewers.</p> <p>One of Axelrod's counterparts in the Romney camp, Ed Gillespie, interviewed on MSNBC, defended Romney's failure to go into the specifics of his tax plans, saying it would not make sense to box himself into a policy ahead of negotiations between a president and Congress.</p> <p>\"If you negotiate this now, you and me on the set or candidates in campaigns across the country, you end up locking people in positions in a political environment that makes it impossible to govern,\" Gillespie said.</p> <p>In the 90-minute debate, Romney was forceful from the start, accusing Obama of repeatedly portraying the Republican's policies as inaccurate, and he maintained that momentum throughout. Obama, looking tired and at times irritated, remained largely calm.</p> <p>Obama, seemingly frustrated with Romney's elusiveness, retorted that it had been his opponent's strategy for 18 months. \"And now, five weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is: 'Never mind'\".</p> <p>At times, Romney patronised the president, saying that he did not understand business or accountancy. \"Mr President, you're entitled to your own airplane and your own house, but not your own facts,\" he said at one point. In another powerful attack which is at the core of the Romney message, he listed unkept promises and told Obama: \"You've been president for four years.\"</p> <p>The president, by contrast, was hesitant in his responses. One of the biggest surprises was that he failed to deliver any of the attacks that have been successful on the campaign trail and have been used to devastating effect in television ads in swing states. There was no mention of Romney's disparaging remarks about the 47% of the population being freeloaders, nor of his opponent's tenure at Bain Capital.</p> <p>The main image of the night will be of Romney, eyes alight, gesticulating from the podium with a rarely seen passion, while Obama, playing into his image as professorial, delivered most of his answers with his head down.</p> <p>On healthcare reform, Obama defended his controversial changes to expand coverage, saying it was almost identical to changes introduced by Romney while he was governor of Massachusetts.</p> <p>Romney denied they were identical, claimed Obama's plan increased costs and reiterated that he would repeal the reform.</p> <p>\"In my opinion, the government is not effective in bringing down the cost of almost anything. The right answer is not to have the federal government take over healthcare,'' Romney said.</p>",
  "<p>Bobby Hogg of Cromarty has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-19802616\" title=\"\">died at the age of 92</a>. His death was not neglected on the slopes of Millbuie or shores of Avoch Bay, especially since the death last year of his brother, Gordon. They were the last two speakers of the Cromarty dialect, on the wild Black Isle of the Moray Firth. With them goes another British tongue, surviving only in a phrase book and a few precious recordings. A small window closes on the great culture of Scotland.</p> <p>I doubt if Cromarty qualifies among the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11304255\" title=\"\">25 \"world languages\" said to die each year</a> (of some 5,000 extant). What is notable is how sad we are at such extinction. Like the disappearance of a rare if unknown species, the world seems diminished thereby. We revel in our own hypermobility and cultural globalism, yet we hope these isolated phenomena will survive unmolested, as if to bring peace of mind to a turbulent world.</p> <p>Cromarty dialect, which sounds incomprehensible on the BBC website, apparently migrated north with fishermen from the Firth of Forth in the late middle ages, carrying traces of Norse and Dutch. Similar to Caithness Doric, it was one of the many lowland tongues, mostly Anglo-Saxon in grammar, that form the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lallans\" title=\"\">\"synthetic Scots\"</a> known as Lallans. The Gaelic of the Highlands is wholly distinct.</p> <p>Dialect is a language that cannot speak its name, because it is so hard to define. Is Danish a dialect of Norwegian, or the other way round? What of northern Irish and southern Gaelic? I once sat in a train opposite a chatty Glaswegian whose conversation was beyond me, yet he professed to speak \"English\". I had similar trouble with Geordie taxi drivers and South Yorkshire churchwardens. The Barnsley film Kes had to be dubbed into \"English\" for DVD distribution.</p> <p>The radio comedian <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b017wyyf\" title=\"\">Mark Steel visited Berwick-upon-Tweed </a>and asked a local entertainer to perform in local dialect. He sounded incomprehensible to radio listeners, but the Berwick audience roared with laughter. To their ears he was speaking ordinary English.</p> <p>This diversity is growing rarer. Travel round southern England and you will notice how its dialects and even accents are declining, other than in settled farming communities. I heard few Cornish voices in Penzance or Truro this summer. The Oxfordshire dialect once normal among Oxford college staff has mostly given way to a ubiquitous \"estuary\". South of the Wash, only East Anglia retains a reasonably communal voice.</p> <p>There is nothing to be done about this anthropological drift. Dialect is as vulnerable to change as is village, town or landscape. It cannot be \"saved\" any more than the communities and families that use it to communicate can be frozen in time. We can record and study how people speak, delighting in the idiosyncrasy. Linguistics is a branch of archaeology, reading cultural DNA deep into the past. But, like Cromarty fishermen, British dialects are on the wane.</p> <p>Their best hope is to be defined as a language and climb aboard the political life raft of regionalism. The \"Doric\" variants of lowland Scots were contrasted by Victorian romantics with the \"Attic\" of Athenian Edinburgh, but they are collectively claiming ethnic status. A member of the Scottish parliament recently took her oath in Doric. The result can be absurd, as in Edinburgh airport's signs in Gaelic, a language never spoken in that city. If not Scots, its ancient Gododdin tongue was north British, that is Welsh. Cardiff should invade.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Ulster variant of lowland Scots, Ullans, won recognition under the 1998 Good Friday agreement as a \"minority language\", despite not one person in the last census claiming to speak it at home. It secured the usual political paraphernalia of university departments and road signs. It is now pushed as \"official\" in some counties, to retaliate against the pushing of Irish in others. This gives Northern Ireland two \"new\" languages in which fewer than 1% of the population claim fluency.</p> <p>Welsh has a vitality of its own, largely thanks to being suppressed for centuries by the English. Now \"official\", it risks falling into the Catalonian trap of identifying political autonomy with a linguistic steamroller. This drives natives who do not speak the language to seek jobs elsewhere, and deters incoming talent. In a land where every worker speaks English, reserving jobs to Welsh speakers alone must soon fall foul of human rights law. It is certainly starving Welsh schools and hospitals of qualified staff, as similar exclusivity is doing in Barcelona. The last official languages forced on the British by a ruling elite were Norman French and Latin. It was fatal to both.</p> <p>That said, linguistic politics will not go away, least of all when central governments accrete ever more power to themselves and thus stir separatist sentiment. Language is the easiest way for weak cultures to buttress themselves against strong ones. Some Basques have even suggested that only those with Basque DNA should be allowed to vote in their elections. It is sad when a culturally enriching experience, the study and practice of a language and literature, becomes a tool of political exclusivity.</p> <p>Of all European languages, English has benefited most from borrowings and imports. It is an astonishing melting pot. Even as its different voices merge towards a monotone \u2013 still some way off \u2013 it is bombarded by pidgins and creoles from new waves of immigrants. Spanglish, Banglish and Hinglish are everywhere in big cities, enhanced by such rich accentuation as the Bangladesh cockney of London's East End. The linguist David Crystal has suggested a future in which we are all \"bidialectal\", with one English to talk to the world and another to use at home.</p> <p>New words and sounds are constantly crashing through the permeable border of British culture. We can salute the passing of one Cromarty, because a hundred more are about to bloom.</p>",
  "<p>Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, has put on hold a key crime and courts bill in order to \"put some bite\" into his predecessor Ken Clarke's proposals to reform community punishments.</p> <p>Grayling is to outline his new approach to community punishments in his Conservative party conference speech on Tuesday. He is also expected to indicate that he wants to accelerate the pace of prison and probation privatisation.</p> <p>Justice ministers have conceded that \"more competition, more outsourcing, and more payment by results\" is now the official way forward. Grayling has said he wants to be \"the tough justice secretary\" and wants to ensure there is an even greater \"punitive element\" in the community sentences handed out to 220,000 offenders every year.</p> <p>Clarke published a package to toughen up community sentences, including intensive punishment orders, 24-hour tagging surveillance and compulsory sobriety orders, but they were intended as an alternative to short-term prison sentences which have stubbornly high re-offending rates.</p> <p>The legislation is urgently needed to set up the new national crime agency. But Grayling has now postponed that. \"Grayling has ripped up Clarke's proposals for community sentences because he doesn't want to make them an alternative to custody,\" say probation sources. \"He wants to make existing community punishments much tougher with a short community sentence with surveillance and tags.\"</p> <p>More punitive kinds of community punishments \u2013 that were already under consideration before Grayling was appointed \u2013 include afternoon curfews, satellite tracking of certain offenders, seizing and selling an offender's assets and property as a punishment in its own right, and a system of fixed penalty on the spot fines for those who fail to comply with their community sentences.</p> <p>The move comes as Napo, the probation union, launches a campaign against the privatisation of the probation service, saying official proposals outlined in July will involve 60% of its work, including core activities, being put out to tender from this autumn. Decisions on the next wave of prison contracts, involving nine jails, worth \u00a3170m a year, are to be announced as soon as MPs return to Westminster later this month, with G4S and Serco among the frontrunners.</p> <p>Napo, which launched its campaign at its 100th anniversary conference, warned that privatisation would be a \"race to the bottom at the expense of effectiveness and efficiency\" and said the obsession with the lowest price was \"bound to compromise public protection\" with fewer staff, less supervision and less training.</p> <p>Harry Fletcher, Napo's assistant general secretary, pointed to a letter from Michael Spurr, chief executive of the National Offender Management Service, to all 35 probation chief officers in England and Wales saying the government was \"examining the potential for core probation services to be competed\". This is believed to include the supervision of some offenders and writing of pre-sentence reports.</p> <p>The supervision of low- and medium-risk offenders has already been handed over to a private company by the decision to award the London contract for community payback schemes, or community service as it used to be known, to Serco in a move said to save \u00a325m.</p> <p>Fletcher said: \"The decision to privatise probation flies in the face of all available evidence. All probation areas are performing well: the service won an excellence award and probation programmes reduced reoffending to 35%. This tendering exercise is not about quality, but purely about ideology.\"</p> <p>A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: \"We are extending competition to bring innovative, quality services across the criminal justice system to reduce reoffending, provided by those best placed to do so, whether they are in the public, voluntary or private sectors. It is important that the prison competition programme is carefully reviewed by ministers before any decisions or announcements are made.\"</p>",
  "<p>Turkey is in danger of being dragged deeper into the Syrian quagmire. The mood in the country is sombre after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/03/turkey-syrian-mortar-bomb?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">cross-border shelling and loss of life</a> on both sides. Over the past few months the near-unanimous enthusiasm for the support Turkey has given the Syrian opposition has gradually given way to a more reflective mood, as the negative consequences of such involvement have become increasingly clear.</p> <p>Turkish backing for Syria's democratic movement was both idealistic and realistic. The ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) felt that its own legitimacy, which rested on its democratic credentials, could be seriously eroded if did not extend support to the movement next door. Ankara also calculated that its long-term economic and strategic interests were best served by supporting the opposition in the hope that transition in Syria would be quick, and the successor regime beholden to Turkey for its support. Ankara also wanted to send a message to Washington that \u2013 despite differences with the United States over Israel's occupation of Palestine and Iran's nuclear enrichment programme \u2013 it was still in the western camp.</p> <p>For a while things seemed to go as planned; but then events took a very different turn. The Syrian democratic movement transmuted from a civil opposition to one of armed rebellion, with a number of groups \u2013 including Salafist jihadists armed by Saudi Arabia and Qatar \u2013 engaging in ruthless confrontation with the state's security forces, leading to the loss of thousands of lives. Moreover it became clear that Turkey, as well as other powers, had vastly underestimated the staying power of the Assad regime and its willingness to leave behind an anarchic mess rather than accept a smooth transition of power.</p> <p>Turkey also found itself caught in a regional cold war between Saudi Arabia \u2013 paradoxically a leading supporter of the democratic opposition \u2013 and Iran, Assad's staunchest supporter. This jeopardised Turkey's relations with Iran, a major supplier of its energy.</p> <p>Above all, Turks became increasingly aware of the conflict's damaging consequences for their own society. Turkey's active support for the anti-Assad rebels has widened its own sectarian divide between the majority Sunnis (who support the predominantly Sunni Syrian rebels) and minority <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10129277\" title=\"\">Alevis</a>, who are sympathetic to the Alawite-dominated Assad regime. The Alevis, who identify Sunni dominance with the governing AKP, recognise a similar problem faced by Syria's minority Alawites confronting a predominantly Sunni rebellion. This explains in part the opposition of the major opposition party, CHP, which draws upon Alevi electoral support, to the government's unbending anti-Assad posture.</p> <p>Turkey's perennial Kurdish problem also risks being exacerbated. Kurdish factions in Syria linked to the Kurdistan Workers' party (PKK) now control parts of northern Syria that could become havens for PKK terrorists, including many who have moved out of Iraqi Kurdistan. Turkey's decades-long policy of winning over the Iraqi Kurdish government to its side against the PKK is in danger of unravelling.</p> <p>The most recent incidents make this dangerous situation even more combustible. On Thursday the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19830928\" title=\"\">Turkish parliament voted to authorise military action</a> in Syria \u2013 although a <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-wont-declare-war-on-syria-turkish-pm-aide.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=31644&amp;NewsCatID=338\" title=\"\">senior adviser to the prime minister said that \"Turkey had no interest in a war\"</a>. Nevertheless the country risks being dragged into a regional conflict without adequate forethought and with unpredictable consequences.</p> <p>The other major supporters of the Syrian opposition, Saudi Arabia and the US, have the luxury of going \"home\" and leaving Syria to its fate if the situation there becomes completely anarchic. Unfortunately, being next door Turkey does not have this luxury. It is imperative, therefore, that Ankara tread very warily and undertake a major reassess its involvement. Otherwise, the Syrian mess could become a Turkish mess as well.</p>",
  "<h2>Top zinger</h2> <p><strong>Romney: </strong>Any challenger running for the White House knows that he needs to get in his \"zingers\" \u2013 those one-liners that play well on TV and stick in the mind. Romney had plenty in the bag and used them well, talking of \"trickle-down government\" and charging that \"under the president's policies, middle-income Americans have been buried; they're just being crushed\".</p> <p><strong>Obama: </strong>While the president generally struggled to get his \"zingers\" across, over-larding them with too much detail, he did get in a pithy dig about Romney's vague budget proposals which he claimed didn't add up. \"It's math. It's arithmetic,\" he said, wondering sardonically later in the debate whether the Republican nominee was keeping his plans \"secret because they're too good?\"</p> <h2>Main attack line</h2> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> In a debate devoted to the economy and domestic government, Romney pressed home his case that Obama was hurting the middle class. He went for the emotional jugular, talking about a woman he'd met in Dayton, Ohio, out of work since May, who asked him: \"Can you help?\" He also memorably attacked Obama for investing $90bn on \"green energy\" \u2013 a phrase delivered as a pejorative.</p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Kept returning, effectively, to the hole in Romney's budget. Add $5tn of tax cuts to $1tn extending the Bush tax cuts for the rich and $2tn of extra defence spending \"that the military hasn't asked for\", and you've got an $8tn gap that ordinary Americans will have to make up. Romney denied the figures, but the charge of irresponsible economic planning could stick.</p> <h2>Stylistic strength</h2> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> Came across as relaxed and on top of his material. Made an effective final statement, delivered direct to camera, in which he promised to help create 12m new jobs, block Obamacare and keep America strong.</p> <p><strong>Obama: </strong>Showed only occasional flashes of his legendary oratorical skills. In an echo of the support he drew at the Democratic national convention last month from his Democratic predecessor in the White House, Obama seemed to gain in stature when he alluded to Bill Clinton. Under Clinton's approach to the economy, he said, \"we created 23m new jobs. We went from deficit to surplus, and business did very well.\"</p> <h2>Stylistic weaknesses</h2> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> In a generally polished performance that made Obama look stuttering and insufficiently prepared, Romney continued to suffer from physical traits that render him wooden on camera. He has a way of holding a half-smile on his face while listening to his opponent that appears perilously close to a smirk.</p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Somebody needs to have the courage to tell the president \u2013 and surely they will before the next debate on 16 October \u2013 that he has to stop staring down at his notes while Romney is speaking. Hasn't he heard of split-screen TV broadcasting? It made him look sullen, grumpy and at worst disengaged from his challenger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397204082\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/4/1349372492918/obama-debate-notes-010.jpg\" alt=\"obama debate notes\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Obama looks down at his notes. Again. Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Gerry</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Gerry</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Missed opportunity</h2> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> Didn't miss much. He'd been so well prepared for this occasion \u2013 honing his lines in lengthy dummy runs with aides \u2013 that he packed it all in, from pithy attacks on Obamacare and the president's job record, to a namecheck of \"our creator\" to please the religious crowd. He also made sure not to repeat the gaffe in his convention speech in Tampa in August, when he forgot to thank America's military heroes.</p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> The Obama re-election campaign has been running TV adverts in key swing states for weeks now reminding voters of <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/09/romney-secret-video-marc-leder-sex-parties\">Romney's comments at a private fundraiser</a> that there are 47% of Americans who are \"dependent on government\". But there was no mention of the remarks during the debate. Pundits were amazed. \"Seriously, Dems, can you believe that Obama never used the 47% video? Incredible!\" tweeted political analyst Larry Sabato.</p> <h2>Fact check</h2> <p><strong>Romney: </strong>Was blatantly creative with the truth at a number of important points. He accused the president of doubling the annual national deficit, <a href=\"http://factcheck.org/2012/10/dubious-denver-debate-declarations/\">which has in fact</a> hovered around the $1.2tn that Obama inherited. The Republican nominee was misleading when he blamed Obama for cutting $716bn from Medicare spending on health care for older people \u2013 those savings were agreed with health insurance providers and hospitals a<a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-potus-debate-fact-check-20121004,0,5248662.story\">s part of the negotiations over Obamacare</a>. He said about half the green energy projects backed by federal grants had closed, when <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-potus-debate-fact-check-20121004,0,5248662.story\">only three of the 26 award-winners</a> have perished and others have prospered.</p> <p><strong>Obama: </strong>Didn't tell the porkies that Romney did, though he did stretch the point on occasion. Obama referred several times to the Republican candidate's plans to make $5tn in tax cuts \u2013 a figure that was deduced by the independent Tax Policy Center but over 10 years. Romney has promised to offset the cuts by ending tax loopholes and deductions, though he has been very slippery about stating precisely <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/04/barack-obama/obama-says-romneys-plan-5-trillion-tax-cut/\">how he would make up the revenue losses</a>.</p>",
  "<p>If BAE Systems combines with EADS would the event count as a change of control, thus triggering an early payout of share options enjoyed by chief executive Ian King and his senior colleagues?</p> <p>It's hard to know for certain since the idea is to create a dual-listed company. There are few of those in existence and they tend not to be what remuneration committees have in mind when they draft the rules of incentive schemes.</p> <p>But legal niceties shouldn't enter the picture. The correct way to proceed is obvious: all incentive arrangements for all BAE employees should be rolled over into the new company on an equivalent basis. Anything else would be outrageous. BAE, if its gets as far as publishing a merger document next week, should put in writing that it will obey the rollover principle.</p>",
  "<p>When Jim Lehrer laid out the ground rules for last night's debate \u2013 six blocks of 15 minutes, two-minute chunks of response, no cheering \u2013 about the only thing that held true was his granting of a preliminary \"noise exception\" as the candidates were introduced. It may be best to view the entire evening through that lens: an hour-and-a-half exception, for the purposes of introduction, to the campaign cacophony we've been subjected to so far, the babble and squeak of commentary and complaints that has been in the background consistently, even <em>during</em> the debates of the Republican primary, when the press was silent but the clown-car of GOP candidates acting as their own peanut gallery.</p> <p>Last night, Mitt Romney and Barack Obama went head-to-head without the distraction of other candidates \u2013 and there was no simultaneous commentary, no applause, not even, really, a moderator. </p> <p>It was an arena with no weapons except one's wits; maybe we shouldn't be surprised that the president's seemed duller. He hasn't participated in a one-on-one contest (much less a football-team-sized scrum) in four years. The only debates he's gotten into with someone who's even close to his equal have been with Michelle and, let's face it, she probably lets him win.</p> <p>In 2008, when John McCain wanted to \"suspend\" the presidential campaigns in order to \"focus on the economy\", he suffered in part because of what it seemed to say about his ability to manage actually being president. Anyone capable of doing <em>that</em> surely shouldn't have to choose between campaigning and participating in a discussion about the economy \u2013 or, as the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_09/014867.php\">pundits put it</a> then, \"I think walking and chewing gum at the same time is part of the president's job.\"</p> <p>In Denver, Obama barely seemed able to stand still and stay awake. He didn't even lift a finger to save Big Bird.</p> <p>The debate highlighted almost all of Obama's worst qualities: he seemed bored to the point of condescension, particular to the point of testiness, and proved for the hundredth or so time that he is Worst. Socialist. Ever. \"We ought to bring the tax rates down,\" Obama agreed, \"Both for corporations and for individuals.\" And that was in addition to telling Lehrer that he and Romney had a \"somewhat similar position\" on social security! This last concession was especially wounding to progressives and undermined the argument Obama implied when he said, \"If you are 54 or 55, you might want to pay attention.\" Maybe he meant that line more literally, in which case I guess there's a reason he put the rest of us to sleep.</p> <p>Not that Romney was much better. Personally more amped, but substantively just as bland, the GOP nominee pulled off only one truly astonishing trick: maintaining the attitude of someone on the high wire while, in reality, creeping close to the ground. Compared to the bold (even foolhardy) choices he's made throughout his campaign in service of appealing to the Republicans' most staunch rightwingers, this iteration of Romney hewed close to the center even as his eyes glinted with radical zeal (or maybe too much sugar).</p> <p>His bullet-pointed answers were all form and no function \u2013 and continued to gloss over specifics with an airy attitude that last night implied confidence rather than confusion. Maybe staffers told him he wasn't going to have to be funny, after all.</p> <p>Granted a context-free performance, Romney unveiled the brand-new General Election Edition of himself: an energetic advocate of bipartisanship and measured regulation of the market. Positioning himself as a cheerful alternative to the distracted, skinny stiff to his left, Romney 4.0 (I think?) so wowed conservative partisans that they seemed to have forgotten the Romney on stage was not the one they'd nominated. Will their excitement over the renewed prospect of winning prevent a Tea Party revolt, or provoke disavowal of the scorched-earth ideological strategy that has led to the re-embrace of Todd Akin?</p> <p>It largely depends on who appears on the hustings today. How much does the mileage for the \"Romney hybrid\" depend on journalists eager for an exciting race clearing the road ahead of obstacles \u2013 such as consistency or detail? </p> <p>The Obama team, reportedly, expected to see pundits swoon over an even tolerable performance by Romney. Indeed, recent history suggests that a desire for a close contest can inflate poor performing candidates' grades \u2013 John Kerry \"won\" all four of his debates against George Bush. Those same Obama staffers were probably less prepared for the onslaught of positive reviews from the general public that came via insta-polls last night and this morning. These results give weight to the argument that Republicans have been making all along: Americans are tired of seeing the same bad news over and over, and the president's turn as the problem-solver has passed.</p> <p>At best, he can only offer stewardship; Romney gave a glimpse of what it might be like to have a bright and shiny new leader. In the marketplace of ideas, Romney presented a beautiful gift box. Unopened. Mint.</p>",
  "<p>Jonathan Lewis's play, set in a military hospital in 1984, was rapturously received when&nbsp;seen at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Boys_%281993_play%29\" title=\"\">Derby Playhouse in 1995, and then at London's Donmar</a>. Catching up with it now, in David Grindley's strongly&nbsp;cast revival, it strikes me as a decent enough piece, but over-reliant on the conventions of army comedy and&nbsp;lacking in real anger at the way disabled servicemen are often thrown on to the scrapheap.</p> <p>I guess we can take its authenticity for granted, since Lewis himself spent time in the very Woolwich hospital where the&nbsp;play is set. We even have, in&nbsp;the character of Menzies, someone who&nbsp;is a potential officer suddenly thrust into a ward occupied by casualties of the Falklands and Northern Ireland conflicts, as&nbsp;was Lewis. And the play captures with vivid accuracy the instinctive distrust of the squaddies for the outsider, their contempt for high military ideals (\"You don't do it for Queen and Country,\" someone protests, \"you do it for your mates\"), and their need to invent ways of alleviating the deadly boredom: one involves a variation, played with beer cans, on the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqakCa-MysE\" title=\"\">Russian roulette scene from The Deer Hunter</a>.</p> <p>It's good as far as it goes, but Lewis leaves until very late in the day the truth about the group's seemingly confident leader, Joe, and never gets to grips with the dismal failure of the authorities to treat or understand post-traumatic stress disorder: what we get is a vigorous slice of military life, but one without much hint of savage indignation.</p> <p>The acting is very good. Laurence Fox has exactly the right artificial swagger as Joe. And Arthur Darvill as a dangerously chirpy, sit-down comedian, together with Cian Barry as a brooding Ulsterman and Jolyon Coy as the putative officer all&nbsp;impress.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Afternoon all.</strong> I don't know about you, but I'm looking forward to this. Pakistan showed against Australia in their final Super Eight game just what a dangerous side they can be (albeit against an Aussie side struck by a contagious panic from which only Mike Hussey was immune). Sri Lanka have showed their class throughout the tournament and are unlikely to be as overawed as Australia were against Pakistan's armoury of spinners.</p> <p><strong>Team news:</strong> Sri Lanka have left out the 18-year-old Akila Dananjaya and brought in Rangana Herath, while Pakistan have somewhat surprisingly opted for Sohail Tanvir over Abdul Razzaq.</p> <p><strong>Sri Lanka: </strong> Jayawardene, Dilshan, Sangakkara, Mathews, Mendis, Thirimanne, Perera, Kulasekara, Malinga, Herath, Mendis<br><strong>Pakistan:</strong> Mohammad Hafeez, Imran Nazir, Nasir Jamshed, Kamran Akmal, Shoaib Malik, Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi, Umar Gul, Sohail Tanvir, Saeed Ajmal, Raza Hasan</p> <p><strong>The toss:</strong> Won by Sri Lanka, who are going to have a bat. Jayawardene thinks the track is going to turn more as the overs wear on, and presumably reckons scoreboard pressure counts for a great deal in these high-pressure semi-final situations.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>1st over: Sri Lanka 5-0 (Jayawardene 5, Dilshan 0)</strong> The left-armer Sohail Tanvir kicks things off with the ball for Pakistan. He's got one of those odd, angular, staccato actions - like a man wrestling a horse. Second ball he drifts on to Jayawardene's pads, and the Sri Lanka captain needs no second invitation to put those away. Umar Gul makes a brave attempt to cut it off, but that's four. Dilshan has a waft at the last.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>2nd over: Sri Lanka 12-0 (Jayawardene 8, Dilshan 4)</strong> Raza Hasan boasts the <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/icc-world-twenty20-2012/engine/records/bowling/best_career_economy_rate.html?id=6856;type=tournament\">best economy rate in the tournament among those who have bowled more than 10 overs</a>, but these two quickly get about the job of scrabbling those figures. Jayawardene drives for three, then Dilshan cuts hard for a thunderous four. That's a fine recovery from the youngster, though \u2013 three dots to end the over.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>3rd over: Sri Lanka 14-0 (Jayawardene 9, Dilshan 5)</strong> Sohail Tanvir windmills in once more and he's beaten Jayawardene's bat this time. Then he clips the edge of the Sri Lankan captain's groping blade, the ball moving away a touch after bursting a cloud of dust from the track. That's a very fine over all in all, just two from it.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>4th over: Sri Lanka 20-0 (Jayawardene 14, Dilshan 6)</strong> Hasan is a gnat's wing away from shimmying through Dilshan's defensive, but an inside edge dons the cape and comes riding to the rescue. This is a good, even battle at the moment \u2013&#xa0;Jayawardene hits another boundary, sweeping and connecting with the middle of the middle of the sweet spot.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>5th over: Sri Lanka 24-0 (Jayawardene 15, Dilshan 8)</strong> \"Looking forward to a cracking game today,\" writes Simon McMahon. \"But to the big issue first. How do you think Michael Vaughan will do on Strictly this weekend? Ramps or Tuffers?\" I'm anticipating more of the latter than the former to be honest. I imagine Victoria Pendleton will last longer in the battle-of-the-sportspeople subplot. Also moving (the ball) beautifully is Sohail Tanvir. He's proving slippery, very difficult to get away outside off stump and the final ball finally finds the outside edge for scutters inches wide of Kamran Akmal behind the stumps. The keeper git a finger to it, but it wasn't really catchable. For Akmal, at least.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>6th over: Sri Lanka 34-0 (Jayawardene 23, Dilshan 8)</strong> Here comes Saeed Ajmal and there goes Mahela Jayawardene, smiting the spinner's loosener for four. An attempted reverse sweep confuses the batsman and the keeper, so Sri Lanka pick up a couple of byes, before another reverse sweep attempt connects to bring four more.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>7th over: Sri Lanka 40-0 (Jayawardene 28, Dilshan 9)</strong> Shahid Afridi finds some serious turn. Jayawardene responds by reverse sweeping for four. That is some shot in the face of that kind of lateral movement.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>8th over: Sri Lanka 44-0 (Jayawardene 30, Dilshan 10)</strong> Jayawardene is batting beautifully, but Dilshan couldn't be more bogged down if he was literally in a bog. Raza Hasan gives them nothing but more four singles there.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>9th over: Sri Lanka 53-0 (Jayawardene 34, Dilshan 15)</strong> Afridi offers Dilshan a little width, but he's just not timing it at the moment. Still, he picks up a couple. Jayawardene is playing the polar opposite. He unfurls a drive creamier than a pint of gold top, a full fat drive that looks so good it must be bad for you. Four runs and nine in total from the over.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>10th over: Sri Lanka 62-0 (Jayawardene 42, Dilshan 16)</strong> Big run out appeal from Pakistan as the batsmen scamper a quick single. Shoaib Malik hits direct, but Jayawardene is home by a foot. Pakistan, well as they've bowled, could really do with a wicket here. Jayawardene reverse sweeps for a couple, orthodox sweeps over the top for a couple more, then tops them all with a skip and a loft straight for four. This guy is pure class.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Jayawardene c Raza Hasan b Afridi 42 (Sri Lanka 63-1)</strong> Big wicket this. Hue wicket. In fact, if you've got a minute, it's a 12-story wicket with a magnificent entrance hall, carpeting throughout, 24-hour portage, and an enormous sign on the roof, saying 'This Is a Large Wicket'. Jayawardene sweeps again but gets it wrong and can only pop up the simplest of catches to Hasan at backward square leg.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>11th over: Sri Lanka 68-1 (Dilshan 17, Sangakkara 5)</strong> That wicket brings Sangakkara to the crease. He starts off with a pure biff, dug out and belted through wide midwicket for four. Out of the frying pan \u2026</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>12th over: Sri Lanka 80-1 (Dilshan 18, Sangakkara 16)</strong> \u2026&#xa0;and into the fire. An inferno in fact. Ajmal returns, drops a tad short and Sangakkara cuts gorgeously for four then drives wonderfully for four more. Twelve off the over.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Sangakkara c Malik b Hafeez 18 (Sri Lanka 84-2)</strong> Hafeez has seen enough and takes the ball himself. He gets one to twist past Sangakkara's groping edge. Kamran Akmal whips off the bails, Simon Taufel calls on the third umpire, but the batsman has his foot safely planted inside his crease. As the decision comes through on the scoreboard a roar goes up. Sangakkara has almost gone roaring past Dilshan's tally already \u2013&#xa0;he's taken 11 balls, Dilshan an uncharacteristic 30. But then he's gone. A lofted drive aimed off towards the Indian Ocean reaches only Shoaib Malik in the deep.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>13rd over: Sri Lanka 85-2 (Dilshan 20, J Mendis 0)</strong> \"Re the description of Jayawardene's wicket,\" begins Robin Hazlehurst. \"If you're Blackadder, does that make Smyth Baldrick? Or was that a Baldrickian description, which would leave Smyth as Blackadder. Hmm...\" I think there's little doubt that we're all nothing but pure Baldrick. Or, at a push, series one Blackadder.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>14th over: Sri Lanka 93-2 (Dilshan 27, J Mendis 1)</strong> Afridi returns once more and sends up the loosest ball of the innings, a big looping full-toss to Dilshan, juicy as a piece of prime rump (or, for those of a vegetarian persuasion, a well braised piece of fennel). Dilshan belts it to the boundary for only his second four.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>15th over: Sri Lanka 100-2 (Dilshan 28, J Mendis 6)</strong> Hafeez finds Mendis's edge. Mendis hasn't had a great tournament thus far, but that's a fine shot \u2013 a clattering reverse sweep against the spin that flies away for four. Hafeez is keeping it tight, pitching it up, denying the batsmen space. Just seven from the over.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>16th over: Sri Lanka 107-2 (Dilshan 28, J Mendis 13)</strong> Here comes Umar Gul for the first time today. Jeevan Mendis plays and misses. And then plays and misses again. The third is clipped away off his pads for a couple, them mistimes a hook that narrowly escapes the leaping Sohail Tanvir. A wide and another pull for a couple keep the score ticking over.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>17th over: Sri Lanka 114-2 (Dilshan 34, J Mendis 14)</strong> Saaed Ajmal, Pakistan's most expensive bowler thus far with figures of 2-0-20-0, comes back into the attack but there's no respite for him. Dilshan, going at less than run a ball at the moment, rocks back and crunches him away for four. He ends the over with two dots, though \u2013 that's a decent recovery. Neither of these batsmen have a strike rate over 100 at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Dilshan lbw b Umar Gul 35 (Sri Lanka 117-3)</strong> This was coming inexorably. Gul continues. Dilshan looks to heave him somewhere in the region of the Outer Hebrides but gets nowhere near connecting. Gul follows up with two superb yorkers, one of which Dilshan digs out for a single, one of which almost breaks Mendis's toes and nearly sends his stumps cartwheeling. Next up there's another yorker length delivery that Mendis tries to whip away and misses, getting trapped plum in front. <strong>WICKE \u2026</strong> No, hang on a minute. The umpires take a look at a replay, though, and Gul has overstepped. It's a no ball! The free hit is mistimed away for a single. Next ball, Dilshan is trapped in exactly the same fashion, but he gets no reprieve. A scratchy innings of 35 off 43 balls comes to a close.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>18th over: Sri Lanka 117-3 (J Mendis 15, Perera 0)</strong> That last ball is yet another dot. What an over of death bowling that is from Umar Gul. Three runs and a wicket from it.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Mendis st Akmal b Ajmal 15 (Sri Lanka 118-4)</strong> Mendis comes trotting down the wicket, Ajmal flings it a couple of yards wide of off stump. Even Kamran Akmal can't miss that stumping.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>19th over: Sri Lanka 123-4 (Perera 2, Mathews 3)</strong> So these two boundary-pepperers have 11 balls to work with. But they can't find it \u2013&#xa0;just five singles from a fine over.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>20th over: Sri Lanka 139-4 (Perera 11, Mathews 10)</strong> Umar Gul to bowl the final over. Mathews flings a flat bat at a wide yorker and gets a fortuitous edge that races away for four. From the third ball Perera almost brains the bowler with a straight drive that rattles away for another boundary, and from the fourth the batsman lofts a drive over extra cover for four more. Sixteen runs from it in total \u2013 that could be a game changing over.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Sri Lanka 139-4; Pakistan require 140 to reach the final</strong></p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong> So what do we think?</strong> On the face of it, that target looks 15 runs short of par. But only Jayawardene (and, briefly, Sangakkara) looked comfortable out there. It's not an easy pitch to score on.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>1st over: Pakistan 8-0 (Hafeez 1, Imran Nazir 7)</strong> Mathews kicks things off with the ball for Sri Lanka. Nazir slashes hard at his first ball, Dilshan gets his fingertips to it at point. That would've been one of the catches of the tournament, but instead it's a let-off for the batsman. A swipe at a bouncer later, Nazir middles a sumptuous drive over the covers for four. He scratched around against Australia but has shown his talent already in this tournament. Sri Lanka would love to nibble him out early.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>2nd over: Pakistan 15-0 (Hafeez 1, Imran Nazir 12)</strong> Nazir shuffles down the pitch to Kulasekara, swipes, and gets a bottom edge into his crotch. Next up he's cut in half as he pokes forward on the defensive. He's a batting fruit machine this guy \u2013 and he's not paying out this over. Another skip and a swish collects nothing but air. Then, jackpot. Down come three cherries \u2013&#xa0;a open-faced nudge zipping down to third man for four. From the last Hafeez charges through for a madcap single. He dives. Kulasekara dives \u2026 but the ball misses the stumps from three yards out. Hafeez would've been back in the hutch had that hit.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>3rd over: Pakistan 22-0 (Hafeez 1, Imran Nazir 14)</strong> Here comes Lasith Malinga. And there go four wides down the leg side. That was a shocker. Another clever glancing nudge by Imran Nazir brings another couple to third man. He's struggling to get Malinga's beautifully disguised slower ball away, though. A wild appeal as the batsman gets slapped on the pad brings nothing more exciting than a shake of the head from Simon Taufel, but it's been a fine over (that wild wide aside).</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>4th over: Pakistan 24-0 (Hafeez 2, Imran Nazir 15)</strong><br>Kulsekera goes all palindromic \u2013 dot, dot, single, elgnis, tod, tod.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>5th over: Pakistan 26-0 (Hafeez 2, Imran Nazir 16)</strong> Malinga continues. This'll be it from him until the death you imagine. Suddenly Pakistan are becalmed. Nazir has the word BOOM emblazoned on his bat, but he'd be better off with WAFT at the moment. Malinga is varying his pace to batsman-bothering effect. And he's got both batters under his spell \u2013&#xa0;Hafeez ends the over with two runs off 11 balls faced.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Imran Nazir b A Mendis 20 (Pakistan 31-1)</strong> Ajantha Mendis shuffles up with the first over of spin bowling of this Pakistan innings. Dilshan dives to deny Hafeez a boundary. That's three more dots he's played out. Eventually he scutters through for a single. Imran Nazir celebrates by sweeping fine for a pressure easing four. But next ball he's gone! A prodding backfoot defensive shot is about as watertight as a Birdseye Potato Waffle and the ball sneaks through to almost apologetically topple the bails.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>6th over: Pakistan 31-1 (Hafeez 2, Jamshed 0)</strong> That's over.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>7th over: Pakistan 39-1 (Hafeez 10, Jamshed 1)</strong> Perera charges in, Hafeez drives authoratively for four. That was a fine shot, but the next isn't \u2013 it's a skewed drive that <em>just</em> evades the diving Herath in the deep. He's swinging like a kid who's had two much Tizer swings at a pi\u00f1ata. It's paid off there though \u2013&#xa0;eight from the over.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>8th over: Pakistan 48-1 (Hafeez 17, Jamshed 3)</strong> More Mendis mystery. Or Mendis misery, if your Pakistan. Miserly Mendis's misery mystery. Or should that be mystery Mendis's miserly misery? Either way, it's all made rather irrelevant by a cack-handed fumble in the deep by Malinga which gives Hafeez the chance to add three to the score, and then a glorious drive from the Pakistan captain over extra cover for four more.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>9th over: Pakistan 55-1 (Hafeez 22, Jamshed 4)</strong> \"The word BOOM on Nazir's bat makes me wonder what other batsmen should have on theirs,\" writes Peter Davies. \"How about NURDLE for Geoff Boycott?\" I love the idea of Boycs coming out to bat with the latest Gray Nicholls Nurdle under his arm. Or perhaps the new Duncan Fearnley Caution. Herath comes in to turn his arm over for the first time today. Pakistan are running the singles very well at the moment, keeping the momentum, the aggression between the wickets giving the sense that they're well on top.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Jamshed lbw b Mathews 4 (Pakistan 55-2)</strong> Sri Lanka needed a wicket and they've got one. Mathews' slower ball deceives Jamshed and slaps the pad bang in front. The only question was where it pitched, but the finger goes up.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Kamran Akmal c Jayawardene b Mathews 1 (Pakistan 57-3)</strong> The tide has turned here. Replays show that lbw delivery to Jamshed, which looked suspect on first viewing, pitched miles outside leg stump. But there's no need for umpiring help here, the hapless Kamran Akmal looping a catch up to the Sri Lanka captain with an ugly heave.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>10th over: Pakistan 58-3 (Hafeez 23, Shoaib Malik 1)</strong> Kamran was done by Mathews' variation there. Pakistan need to settle again.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>WICKET!!! Shoaib Malik b Herath 6 (Pakistan 64-4)</strong> That's a gorgeous bit of bowling from Herath. That delivery could model underwear. Shoaib Malik, who was looking nicely set early on, it's completely <em>done</em> by one that turns past the outside edge and bowls him.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>11th over: Pakistan 64-4 (Hafeez 24, Umar Akmal 0)</strong> \"Surely Boycott would come out to bat with a stick of rhubarb with his mother's name on it? Just to show how easy it is to play lollipop bowling...\" suggests Jim Lewis. \"Who's your money on? IT's going to be tight but I fancy Pakistan to just sneak it.\" I'd have backed Pakistan before that last over obviously, but it's anyone's game now. Hafeez has a big role to play.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>12th over: Pakistan 71-4 (Hafeez 30, Umar Akmal 1) Pakistan require 69 from 48 balls</strong> DROPPED! What a dolly for Malinga to put down. Hafeez lifts Mathews to long on, then goes cursing and shouting at himself as he jogs down the track as he sees it gently looping towards the man in the deep. But somehow he manages to put it down. Hafeez celebrates by rocking back and smiting Mathews away for four.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>13rd over: Pakistan 83-4 (Hafeez 41, Umar Akmal 2) Pakistan require 57 from 42 balls</strong> \"In response to Peter Davies's thoughts on revelatory bat names,\" writes David Guerry. \"I can vividly imagine our very own KP wielding a custom-made Kookaburra Ka-Ching! to notch up pots of what he values most: runs.\" Steady now. Hafeez is playing the epitomy of a captain's innings here, just as Jayawardene did for Sri Lanka \u2013&#xa0;he reverse sweeps Herath away for four then charges and bashes the bowler away for a straight six. Kulasekera might have caught that on the rope but couldn't quite get there. Twelve from the over.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>14th over: Pakistan 91-4 (Hafeez 42, Umar Akmal 9) Pakistan require 49 from 36 balls</strong> Ajantha Mendis returns. Umar Akmal cuts brilliantly for four, an early pressure-relieving boundary. Like barflies on a quiet night they settle for a couple of singles and a double from the rest. This is set up for a fantastic finale.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Hafeez st Sangakkara b Herath 42 (Pakistan 91-5)</strong> That's a huge wicket. In fact, if you've got a moment \u2026 see the 11th over of the Sri Lanka innings. Herath turns one past the charging Hafeez, and Sangakkara removes the bails to spark wild celebrations.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Afridi b Herath 0 (Pakistan 91-6)</strong> Boom Boom goes first ball! The arm ball goes straight through the game, via an inside edge. This is game-changing stuff from Herath.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>15th over: Pakistan 92-6 (Umar Akmal 9, Sohail Tanvir 1) Pakistan require 48 from 30 balls</strong> Sohail blocks out the hat-trick ball, prods away the next two and only a clip off the pads from the last prevents Herath from registering a double wicket maiden.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>16th over: Pakistan 101-6 (Umar Akmal 16, Sohail Tanvir 3) Pakistan require 39 from 24 balls</strong> \"Yup, good to see another performance of the classic play Pakistani Run Chases: An Act in Four Parts,\" writes SB Tang. \"A cruise control start, followed by attempted self-harm, followed by a period of steady reconstruction, and finally concluding with a nail-biting last over result. As long as Umar Akmal's at the crease, Pakistan have a decent chance.\" Umar Akmal lashes Mathews over the covers for four with a flat-batted, charging drive that just plops over Ajantha Mendis's outstretched arm. Nine from the over.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>17th over: Pakistan 108-6 (Umar Akmal 17, Sohail Tanvir 8) Pakistan require 32 from 18 balls</strong> \"Assuming they get through, will SL drop Lasith Malinga?\" wonders John Starbuck. \"He's struggling, it seems, but when you're a talisman, does it count?\" He's undroppable, though, surely? Because when he gets it right he gets it very right. And he gets it right here. Tanvir smashes Malinga's first ball here way over the covers for four, but fails to make contact with a wide yorker and there's two more dots to follow it up. A single down to long on brings Umar Akmal back on strike, then it's Bad Malinga again \u2013 a wide. A single off the last, so seven from the over. Three overs to go \u2013&#xa0;Pakistan need nearly 11 an over, but they've got little other than Umar Gul after this pair.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Sohail Tanvir st Sangakkara b A Mendis 8 (Pakistan 113-7)</strong> This is on a knife-edge. Umar Akmal scutters through for a clever couple of runs off Ajantha Mendis, then squirts a horrible heave away for a couple more. A single brings Sohail Tanvir to the danger end, and he's a rabbit-in-the-headlights in the face of Mendis. He blindly charges and heaves. And to no one's great surprise gets himself stumped.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>18th over: Pakistan 113-7 (Umar Akmal 22, Umar Gul 0) Pakistan require 27 from 12 balls</strong> Umar Gul plays out a couple of dots, giving Umar Akmal the strike for the next over.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>REVIEW!</strong> Ludicrous! The Umars get themselves in a right muddle. Gul is sent back, has no chance to make his ground, but Malinga makes a right mess of collecting the ball and can only fumble it pathetically on to the stumps, barely dislodging the bails. That means it's close, very close.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>NOT OUT!</strong> Oh, Lasith.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>19th over: Pakistan 117-7 (Umar Akmal 24, Umar Gul 1) Pakistan require 23 from six balls</strong> \"Umar Gul's expensive last over will be the difference,\" reckons Khalid Hasan. Well, he's got the chance to make amends now, although he's struggling to put bat on ball. Malinga is flinging it wide to Gul, keeping it out of his swing range, so much so he's given him a wide. But even so this is a superb over. Malinga finishes with figures of 4-0-19-0.

  "<p>I follow a few foreign correspondents on Twitter, western reporters whose patch is large swaths of the African continent, and many of them retweet some of the replies they receive from their followers. These people often exhort the journalists to report \"positive news\" and criticise them for writing about corruption or other bad behaviour that's blighting their corner of the world. And if I'm honest, I understand where many of the complainers are coming from, even as I don't often agree.</p> <p>I was reminded of this earlier this week when Solange released the Cape Town-set video for her new song, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy9W_mrY_Vk\" title=\"\">Losing You</a>. The video features the pop star in a series of beautiful outfits alongside a troop of American friends as well as members of Le Sapeur community \u2013 a Congolese subculture that has its own fairly established chapter in South Africa. Solange was inspired by the work of Italian photographer <a href=\"http://www.photodantam.com/\" title=\"\">Daniele Tamagni</a>, who shot and collected images of the La SAPE (<a href=\"http://afrolegends.com/2012/08/30/la-sape-societe-des-ambianceurs-et-personnes-elegantes/\" title=\"\">Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Ambianceurs et des Personnes \u00c9l\u00e9gantes</a>) community in his book, Gentlemen of Bacongo. It is a dreamy, colourful four minutes.</p> <p>A few weeks prior, hip-hop star Rick Ross had released the Nigeria-shot promo for his single <a href=\"http://youtu.be/xu60JoFAN78\" title=\"\">Hold Me Back</a>. In contrast to Solange's effort, this is a grittier offering, starting with a Biafra news spot from the 1960s, is shot in stark black-and-white in Lagos (Sura Market and Obalende neighbourhoods), with even starker imagery \u2013 crying children (and in a couple of scenes, reaching for the dollars proffered by the rapper's crew), rubbish dumps, men praying in a mosque and even a couple of photogenic goats. Prior to shooting the video, he'd tweeted: \"Other rappers won't come here. I'm filming a video and performing here.\"</p> <p>The two videos \u2013 one more than the other, granted \u2013 have garnered a good deal of comment and criticism. For many, whether going the circuitous or straightforward route, the conclusion is that these artists are exploiting \"poor Africans\". A lot of people on music blogs expressed their fury at Ross's video, criticising what they saw as \"bad publicity\" for Nigeria, while others praised him, saying the video shone a light on the desperate poverty that is the reality for many.</p> <p>I should probably qualify that I'm not a fan of Ross or his music. And when I watched his video, I struggled to find a discernible message in it (a charge I could level at a lot of music videos, to be fair). Is the video telling us anything new? Is it a comment on Biafra (written about this week by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/02/biafran-war-nigeria-mediocrity-persecution-igbo?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Chinua Achebe</a>)? Can we honestly say we in the political west are still unaware of the grinding poverty of poor people around the world?</p> <p>It's a confused video, bathed in the usual machismo of rap. My problem with the video is not the content per se; it is not a problem to depict the reality of a situation that affects millions of people every day. My issue lies with the eye behind the lens: what story is this recording of poverty showing? If Ross had filmed this video in Tower Hamlets, east London \u2013 one of the poorest boroughs in the country \u2013 for example, it would have represented an indictment of the way in which a developed nation like Britain allows its most disadvantaged people to live. Shooting it in Nigeria is not news \u2013 not to the poor people in the video, nor to the political class. In a world where Ross tweets before shooting: \"Filming in the slums in Lagos. I just bought out the whole grocery store and gave it to the village. #MMG presence strong in our homeland\", and hands out cash to the kids, he has cast himself as the Great Emancipator. The poverty is merely a backdrop to his own personal narrative.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.thefader.com/2012/10/02/interview-solange/\" title=\"\">talking about her video</a>, Solange told The Fader: \"I remember reading about [the Sapeurs] and thinking it was the most interesting and complex and unique thing that I had seen in a long time. We really want to capture what the vibe is.\" It is to Solange's credit that the Sapeurs who appear in her video seem to be more than just background artists. Their cultural existence is acknowledged and celebrated, not merely appropriated. It's a lesson we could all do with learning.</p>",

Not exactly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/13/new-band-psy\" title=\"\">Psy/Gangnam Style statistics</a>, but still, pretty impressive for a debut single. It's the lead track from the Dublin quartet's EP and the video is a real tear-jerker, a beauty-and-the-beast melodrama with a happy ending (don't be rude), set in an office much like the one in The Office, with the lead character, the facially challenged one, looking roughly like Martin Freeman might do halfway through being made to resemble a werewolf as he moons over the hottie two desks down.</p> <p>Kodaline's other tracks haven't fared quite as well but the band \u2013 four schoolfriends in their early 20s from an estate near Dublin airport \u2013 are being highly touted by the usual Zanes and Huws for their admittedly very Zane- and Huw-friendly indie anthemia. It's halfway between Oasis's brand of high/fly/sky banal uplift and Coldplay's soaring tedium. The four tracks on their EP were recorded with Steve Harris, producer of the Dave Matthews Band and mixer of U2, and you can tell \u2013 it's no-nonsense indie with epic ambitions, and Kodaline appear to believe the Joshua Tree and Parachutes are the last word in searing emotionalism. \"Music should have a purpose, you know,\" they say. \"Our purpose is honesty.\"</p> <p>Did we say they sound like Coldplay? All I Want really sounds like Coldplay, or at least Coldplay as they sounded 10 years ago, which, to be honest, was the last time we deliberately set out to listen to them. Kodaline are Yellow-era Coldplay, although there is a dash of Viva La Vida about the mid-section of All I Want, and when it really gets going the drumming is excellent, with apologies for the faint praise. Meanwhile, the singer has modest enough demands: \"All I want is nothing more \u2013 to hear you knocking at my door.\" We feel sure that can be arranged, especially now that his band are taking off. His voice is very Chris Martin, our least favourite rock superstar this side of Bono, and the music accelerates from a ballady start to a brisk canter. Songs that canter \u2013 yuk.</p> <p>Still, Kodaline should worry \u2013 the song has been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/mar/09/popandrock4\" title=\"\">picked to appear on Grey's Anatomy</a>, a sure sign of something (probably that they are about to have their song featured on the soundtrack to Grey's Anatomy). Lose Your Mind is psych-by-numbers, the sort of thing Liam Gallagher might scribble on the back of a serviette while the missus takes the nipper to the bathroom at Nando's. \"100,000 butterflies floating in the orange skies above my head,\" goes the lyric, the singer variously dreaming of wandering lonely as a cloud and holding a dolphin's fin. Perfect World is so post-Thom/Bono/Chris, the holy triumvirate of everything mundane about rock these last 25 years, it's not true. On Pray the singer admits he's been counting the days since his woman went away and he's been drinking alone to stop him weeping. Know the feeling, mate \u2013 we felt like bawling two minutes into this tune. That said, we fully accept that, if you like this kind of thing, you'll love it, and we can see its appeal even if it does make us gag, much like the girl in the video when old ugly chops catches her by surprise by the water cooler.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"About to start a full-scale invasion into your middle ear\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://spindlemagazine.com/2012/09/review-kodaline-kodaline-ep/\" title=\"\">Spindle</a>.</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> About to parachute into a US hospital soap near you.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Lose their mind \u2026 round about \u2026 now.</p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> Work in an office.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> The Kodaline EP is out now on B-Unique/RCA Victor.</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> Coldplay, Elbow, U2, Verve.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.kodaline.com//\" title=\"\">kodaline.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>Friday's new band:</strong> Nadine Shah.</p>",
  "<p>Google has reached a settlement with a group of American publishers over its plans to create a massive web-based library, ending seven years of court wrangling.</p> <p>The deal means that the scheme, the Google Library Project, can move ahead, collecting and scanning books online and making them searchable to web users. </p> <p>The project had begun with Google Books working with seven major universities to digitise their libraries. Once the books are scanned, excerpts can be read in search results. But several major publishers went to the courts, complaining of copyright infringement. </p> <p>The publishers were worried that the Google Library Project would undermine their business models, with users choosing to read large samples of the books online rather than to buy them.</p> <p>The deal announced today, the terms of which have not been fully disclosed, means that publishers will be able to choose to make their books available to Google or to have them removed from the project. Google Books will now make 20% of any book browsable and also allow users to purchase the whole book.</p> <p>Tom Allen, the president of the Association of American Publishers, which represented the aggrieved companies, said in a statement: \"We are pleased that this settlement addresses the issues that led to the litigation. It shows that digital services can provide innovative means to discover content while still respecting the rights of copyright holders.\"</p> <p>The publishers involved in the case were McGraw Hill, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Simon and Schuster and Pearson Education Inc and Penguin Group (USA), which are both part of Pearson.</p> <p>Google also welcomed the deal. The web giant's chief legal officer, David Drummond, said: \"By putting this litigation with the publishers behind us, we can stay focused on our core mission and work to increase the number of books available to educate, excite and entertain our users.\"</p> <p>The deal, however, does not affect another current law suit, around similar issues, which was brought by the Authors Guild.</p>",
  "<p>Health and drug safety watchdogs will on Thursday address growing concerns over a rapidly evolving outbreak of a rare form of meningitis which has already killed four people and infected dozens more across five states.</p> <p>So far, 26 people have been struck down by the illness, with some described as being in a \"very serious\" condition. The outbreak is suspected of being caused by contaminated steroid medication.</p> <p>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will hold a joint press conference with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Thursday at 1pm ET to provide fresh details of the investigation into the cause of the outbreak.</p> <p>All of those who died received steroid injections, mostly for back pain. The FDA said the drug, a fairly typical treatment, was made by a speciality pharmacy in Massachusetts, the New England Compounding Center (NECC) </p> <p>NECC issued a recall of three batches of the steroid, methylprednisolone acetate, last week. In a statement, the company said it had voluntarily suspended operations and was working with regulators to identify the source of the infection.</p> <p>Compounding pharmacies, which are regulated at state level, mix ingredients for customized medicines that are not commercially available. The medicines are not approved for use by the FDA.</p> <p>The CDC says 18 of the reported meningitis cases were in Tennessee, where a Nashville clinic received the largest shipment of the steroid. Three cases have been reported in Virginia, two in Maryland, two in Florida and one in North Carolina. Two of the deaths were in Tennessee, and Virginia and Maryland had one each, CDC officials said.</p> <p>Unlike more common forms of the disease, the type of meningitis involved \u2013 caused by a fungus often found in leaf mould \u2013 is not contagious. Health officials suspect the fungus may have been present in the steroid.</p> <p>John Dreyzehner, the Tennessee department of health commissioner, said more cases were almost certain to appear in the coming days. Five new cases had appeared in the last 24 hours, he said on Wednesday, describing the situation as a \"rapidly evolving outbreak\".</p> <p>What is not clear is whether new infections are developing. The cases reported so far occurred in the past two or three months.</p> <p>In Tennessee, officials are contacting more than 900 people who received the suspect steroid in the past three months. Seventeen of the Tennessee cases received injections at the Saint Thomas Outpatient Neurosurgery Center in Nashville. It had 2,000 vials of the suspect lots, the largest number. That clinic voluntarily closed last month to deal with the investigation.</p> <p>The incubation period is estimated at anywhere from two to 28 days, so some people may not have fallen ill yet, Tennessee health officials said.</p> <p>Symptoms of Meningitis, an inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord, include severe and worsening headache, nausea, dizziness and fever. Some of those affected in the latest outbreak also experienced slurred speech, and difficulty walking and urinating. </p> <p>Dr David Reagan, a Tennessee health official, said: \"Some are doing well and improving. Some are very ill, very, very seriously ill and may die.\" Fungal meningitis is treated with high-dose anti-fungal medications, usually given intravenously in a hospital.</p> <p>The primary suspicion for the outbreak has fallen on the steroid medication, but investigators also have been looking into the antiseptic and anaesthetic used during the injections. Neither has been ruled out. Steroid shots are common for back pain, often given together with an anaesthetic.</p> <p>The outbreak was discovered about two weeks ago when Vanderbilt University's Dr April Pettit was treating a patient who was ill for reasons doctors did not understand.</p> <p>When fungus was found in the patient's spinal fluid, Pettit began asking questions and learned the patient had recently received steroid injections in his spine, according to Dr William Schaffner, who chairs Vanderbilt's Department of Preventive Medicine.</p> <p>\"When it became clear that the infection-control practices at the clinic were up to par, the steroid medication became implicated,\" Schaffner said.<br></p>",
  "<p>A catalogue of failures in how England's farmers prevent their cattle spreading TB between herds was uncovered by <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/food/fvo/act_getPDF.cfm?PDF_ID=9444\" title=\"\">an official European Commission inspection</a>, the Guardian has learned, undermining the case for the imminent cull of badgers.</p> <p>The previously unreported document was highlighted as government body <a href=\"http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/about_us/news/2012/041012.aspx\" title=\"\">Natural England issued a licence for a pilot cull in west Somerset on Thursday</a>, following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/17/first-badger-cull-licence-england\" title=\"\">last month's granting of a licence to shoot badgers in Gloucestershire</a>.</p> <p>The government and the National Farmers' Union (NFU) claim the cull is necessary to curb the rising number of tuberculosis infections in cattle. But cull opponents said it was \"utterly outrageous\" that badgers were paying the price for some farmers flouting biosecurity measures.</p> <p>Cattle in England must be regularly tested for TB, and those found to have the disease must be quickly isolated and then removed. But the EC report, based on inspections made in September 2011, found numerous \"shortcomings\", including missed targets on both the rapid removal of cattle with TB and the follow-up of missed tests, and \"weaknesses in cleaning and disinfection at farm, vehicle, market and slaughterhouse levels, exacerbated by lack of adequate supervision\". All these problems increase the risk of TB spreading between cattle.</p> <p>The EC gave the UK \u20ac23m in 2011 for bovine TB control measures. Its inspectors found that the removal of cattle with TB was below the target of 90% in 10 days, and that in the first half of 2011 more than 1,000 cattle had not been removed after 30 days. They found that there were 3,300 overdue TB tests as of May 2011 and that \"many\" calf passports \u2013 used to track movements \u2013 were incomplete. They also found that only 56% disease report forms had been completed on time, with the authorities blaming lack of resources. Funding cuts were cited as the reason for the failure of local authorities to update central databases systematically.</p> <p>The EC report stated: \"Local authority surveys provided evidence that some cattle farmers may have been illegally swapping cattle ear tags, ie retaining TB-positive animals in their herds and sending less productive animals to slaughter in their place.\" There are 8.5 million cattle in Great Britain on 81,000 holdings, with 2.4m movements a year. In 2011, about 7% of herds were under restriction due to TB and 26,000 cattle were destroyed.</p> <p>Mark Jones, a vet and executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.hsi.org/world/united_kingdom/news/news/2012/09/badger_team_091912.html\" title=\"\">Humane Society International UK</a>, said: \"It is cattle, not badgers, that are the main transmitters of bovine TB so it is utterly outrageous for badgers to pay the price for farmers' failure to abide by proper biosecurity measures.\".</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/.../atoz/tb/isg/report/final_report.pdf\" title=\"\">landmark study in 2008</a> of badger culling as a way of controlling bovine TB concluded it could make \"no meaningful contribution\", with its leader, Prof John Bourne, telling the government: \"Scientific findings indicate the rising incidence of disease can be reversed by the rigid application of cattle-based control measures alone.\"</p> <p>A Defra spokesman said: \"Measures to reduce the risk of bovine TB being spread between cattle were strengthened this year as part of the government's plan to eradicate the disease in England, including tightening regulations around the movement and testing of cattle. Scientific evidence tells us that we cannot successfully eradicate bovine TB without also addressing the problem in wildlife, which is why a cull of badgers is needed.\" The <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/food/fvo/act_getPDFannx.cfm?ANX_ID=6599\" title=\"\">government accepted</a> most of the recommendations made by the EC inspectors.</p> <p>An NFU spokesman said: \"Cattle controls have been strengthened by Defra since this report was released. We understand steps may be taken to strengthen these in January 2013.</p> <p>\"We hope these moves, alongside the pilot badger culls, and the development of badger and cattle vaccines, will help control the disease and eventually eradicate it.\"</p> <p>Jones said ministers must wait and assess the impact of tighter biosecurity: \"There is some evidence from west Wales, where the measures have been tightened up, that TB in cattle is coming down. There needs to be time to see if there has been an impact, before going ahead with a massacre of badgers.\" Bovine TB in Wales, which has rejected badger culling, <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN06081.pdf\" title=\"\">has fallen since 2008</a>.</p> <p>David Fisher, a Defra-funded TB inspector in Wales until 2011, said: \"It is an open secret that isolation of [TB] reactors and inconclusive reactors is rare.\" Fisher said Defra's own database showed that in 2009 there was 20.8% non-compliance for bovine TB issues and that there was only one instance that year of a dairy farm being checked for compliance with an isolation notice.</p> <p>The government argues that the landmark study shows a 12-16% reduction in TB infections could be achieved if 70% of all badgers in a large area are killed for at least four consecutive areas. But opponents say that argument does not hold up because different methods would be used in the proposed culls, which could ultimately kill 100,000 badgers \u2013 a third of the national population.</p> <p>Prof Graham Medley, at the University of Warwick, told the Guardian the only way to eradicate TB in cattle would be a return to the strict and effective controls in place 40 years ago. \"There is no scientific underpinning for the proposed killing of badgers.\"</p> <p>Time is running out to begin the culling this year, as it must continue for six weeks, but badgers spend little time above ground in the winter months. The granting of the licence for Somerset on Thursday, however, has removed the main final hurdle for the trials to go ahead.</p> <p>The cull has prompted widespread opposition from animal and wildlife groups and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/01/badger-activists-prepare-for-cull\" title=\"\">protests are expected</a> at the cull sites during the night-time shoots. Senior police authorities have expressed their fears for public safety, and this week Gloucestershire Constabulary said it had cancelled all leave for its officers until January.</p> <p>Gloucestershire Police Federation, which represents officers, responded by warning its members had had limited leave this summer due to the Olympics and were tired. Chairman Tracy De Young said: \"We are concerned that as fatigue takes hold mistakes will be made and accidents will occur. At worst, my fear is that the longer the leave ban goes on, the worse the situation will become, until the unthinkable happens and we have a fatal incident.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/38257\" title=\"\">A petition on the government's website opposing the badger cull</a> now has 146,000 signatures and several MPs have told the Guardian they are confident they will win a debate in parliament on the issue.</p>",
  "<p>The British foreign secretary and the Archbishop of Westminster have joined forces in opposing the route of Israel's vast barrier along the West Bank, which adversely affects a community of monks, nuns and Christian families near Bethlehem.</p> <p>In a private letter seen by the Guardian, William Hague told Archbishop Vincent Nichols that he shared his \"concerns about the problem of land confiscation by the Israeli authorities affecting the people of Beit Jala and similar Palestinian communities in the occupied territories\".</p> <p>The letter suggested that the religious orders in Beit Jala needed to give a \"clear signal\" of opposition to the barrier's route to bolster a legal case against the state of Israel. Shortly afterwards, the monks joined the legal challenge. A ruling in the case is expected by the end of this year.</p> <p>In addition to Hague's personal intervention, the British consulate in East Jerusalem is supporting the community and the Department for International Development (Dfid) is providing indirect funding for the legal challenge.</p> <p>The consulate is championing the case as a symbolic example of the impact of the separation barrier on Palestinian communities and the loss of Palestinian land. Around 85% of the barrier is inside the West Bank.</p> <p>British government policy is that Israel is entitled to build a barrier but it should lie on the internationally recognised 1967 Green Line, not on confiscated Palestinian land. It is concerned that the route is harming the prospects of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p> <p>Dfid has given a two-year grant of \u00a32.9m to the Norwegian Refugee Council, which in turn is funding the Society of St Yves, a Jerusalem-based Catholic human rights organisation, which is assisting the Beit Jala community with its case.</p> <p>The Archbishop of Westminster, England's most senior Catholic, espoused the case of the Cremisan monastery and convent, and their surrounding Palestinian Christian community, in Beit Jala following a visit last November. In<a href=\"http://www.thetablet.co.uk/blogs/222/18\" title=\"\"> last year's Christmas Eve homily</a>, two days after the date of Hague's letter, the archbishop offered prayers for the community's \"legal battle to protect their land and homes from further expropriation by Israel\".</p> <p>He went on: \"Over 50 families face losing their land and their homes as action is taken to complete the separation/security wall across the territory of the district of Bethlehem. We pray for them tonight.\"</p> <p>Nichols's principal concern was to ensure that the Christian presence in the Holy Land was preserved, his spokesman told the Guardian. \"The numbers are dwindling. The archbishop is trying to encourage and give succour to Christian communities. The imposition of this wall will jeopardise the livelihoods of many of the families.\"</p> <p>Nichols was aware that \"sensitivities are high,\" the spokesman added.</p> <p>Beit Jala has a population of around 10,000, more than 80% of whom are Christian.</p> <p>Under the current Israeli plan, the barrier will run between the monastery and convent, separating the two establishments and cutting off the monks from the local Christian community. It will also separate the convent and more than 50 families from land they own.</p> <p>As part of the campaign against the barrier's route, a mass is conducted each Friday by Beit Jala's parish priest, Father Ibrahim Shomali, under olive trees overlooking the Cremisan valley. \"This is Palestinian land,\" he said. \"If Israel wants to build a wall, they should put it on their own land.\"</p> <p>Many Palestinian Christians have emigrated as a result of the economic impact of the separation barrier which has already been built around the city of Bethlehem and its nearby villages. Residents have difficulty in accessing their land and exporting their produce. The hurdles in reaching Christian holy sites in Jerusalem is another factor encouraging them to leave.</p> <p>\"People are migrating because of the situation. There is no work, and living costs are high,\" said Samira Qaisieh, 47, whose stone house with views across the valley has belonged to her husband's family since it was built almost 100 years ago. \"If the situation stays as it is, I'm also thinking of leaving with my children.\"</p> <p>The terraces around Cremisan, on which Palestinian families picnic at weekends under olive and fruit trees, are overlooked by two Israeli settlements, Gilo and Har Gilo. Critics of the barrier say its intention is to take these settlements and as much of the surrounding land as possible onto the Israeli side in what is in effect a land grab.</p> <p>In 2004, the International Court of Justice <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jul/09/israelandthepalestinians.unitednations\" title=\"\">ruled that the route of Israel's barrier on Palestinian territory breached international law</a> and was \"tantamount to de facto annexation\".</p> <p>According to Israel's ministry of defence, \"the route of the security fence in the Beit Jala region is based purely on security considerations. This portion \u2026 is there solely to keep terror out of Jerusalem.\" In a lengthy statement, the MoD recalled events of the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, in which \"Jerusalem was the prime target of a brutal Palestinian terror campaign; suicide bombings, shootings, and stabbings were weekly, and sometimes daily occurrences\".</p> <p>It said it was co-ordinating the route of the barrier with the local community, would provide an gate to allow access to land, and would pay compensation for land taken for the barrier's construction.</p> <p>The ministry said the monks had initially requested to stay on the Israeli side of the barrier, and had only latterly demanded to be on the Palestinian side.</p> <p>According to one source, the monks \u2013 who produce Palestine's only wine, under the Cremisan label \u2013 changed their stance following pressure from the Catholic hierarchy. Initially they believed being on the Israeli side of the barrier would give them continued access to the Israeli market for their wine, the source said.</p> <p>Representatives of the monastery, whose presence at Cremisan dates back to 1891, declined to speak to the Guardian. However, after reports surfaced of tensions between the nuns and the monks over the route of the barrier, they issued a joint statement earlier this year \"clearly affirm[ing] there is no discord among them whatsoever and that their positions with regard to building the 'wall' do not differ\". The two religious communities, part of the Salesian order, \"enjoy excellent relations and mutual respect\", it added.</p> <p>The half-dozen elderly nuns at the convent have objected to the barrier's route since first being notified six years ago. Under the present proposal, the convent's premises will abut the barrier.

  "<p><strong>Shire</strong>'s best known drug Vyvanse could prove a multi-million dollar winner in new areas away from its main use as a treatment for hyperactivity, the City believes.</p> <p>Following a lunch with company directors, analysts at Shire's house broker Morgan Stanley said the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder drug could also be used to treat depression, schizophrenia and binge eating. Analyst Peter Verdult forecast potential sales of $500m to $2bn from these new areas, which could add between 110p and 400p a share to the company's value. He said:</p> <blockquote> While the market remains sceptical about the potential of Vyvanse ex-ADHD we note phase 3 depression data in the third quarter of 2013 and potentially phase 3 schizophrenia and binge eating disorder by the end of 2013. Vyvanse in ADHD currently does $1.1bn in sales and is protected until 2024. We forecast peak sales of $3.5bn with $0.5bn coming from new uses. <br> We argue the current share price gives investors a free option to play this upside opportunity. </blockquote> <p>Verdult also suggested Shire could be on the takeover trail:</p> <blockquote> We forecast $1bn-$2bn free cash flow per annum until 2015, and note a net cash balance sheet. While acknowledging a mixed track record with respect to M&amp;A - write downs on Movetis are expected - [it] continues to be pursued to \"both diversify growth and sustain current platforms\"; we expect a focus on the orphan drugs and regenerative medicine businesses. </blockquote> <p>Shire closed 4p lower at \u00a318.20.</p> <p>Overall, investors remained cautious as Spain, Greece and Portugal continued to dominate the eurozone crisis. Tensions between Turkey and Syria added to the nervous mood. With the Bank of England and European Central Bank both leaving interest rates and asset purchases as they were, the focus now will be on Friday's US non-farm payroll figures, especially in the light of the current American election campaign. So the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished virtually unchanged, up 1.97 points at 5827.78.</p> <p><strong>Tesco</strong> was the leading faller in the FTSE 100, down another 9.8p to 318.15p after Wednesday's news of its first fall in profits for 20 years. In a sell note Dave McCarthy at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> Tesco disappointed with its interims, missing trading profit expectations by around 3%, leading to further downgrades to forecasts (we cut earnings per share by around 7%). This is on top of other recent downgrades. Tesco pointed to an improvement in UK sales, but this still represents a significant like for like volume loss. Meanwhile problems in Asia and Europe are mounting and the US continues to lose money, while the bank is standing still on an underlying basis. We remain concerned and believe that Tesco strategy needs a major overhaul. </blockquote> <p>Russian steelmaker <strong>Evraz</strong> slipped 2.2p to 245.1p after it paid $800m in cash and shares to raise its stake in coal miner Raspadskaya from 41% to 82%. A recent decline in the oil price left <strong>BP</strong> 4.85p lower at 434.2p.</p> <p>But <strong>Tate and Lyle</strong> added 12.5p to 687p after a couple of broker upgrades.</p> <p>Martin Deboo at Investec raised his price target on the sweeteners and starches maker from 650p to 700p after its recent trading update, although he kept his hold recommendation. He said:</p> <blockquote> The second quarter commentary was better than our expectations, with volume growth in speciality food ingredients (against a tough comp) key. Meanwhile, the hurdle represented by the pricing rounds looks to be lowering. So the outlook is getting brighter and we upgrade our 2013 estimate by 2%.

As it is for us. We understand the bull case on this stock, but need to check its horns. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Credit Suisse raised its rating from neutral to outperform and its price target from 700p to 750p:</p> <blockquote> There is no easy way to value Tate &amp; Lyle, but it does seem to us to be a better business for all the changes we have seen and that this is not reflected in the share price (which is down 8% year to date versus a staples sector up 18%) </blockquote> <p><strong>Intercontinental Hotels</strong> climbed 30p to \u00a316.69 after better than expected third quarter earnings from US peer Marriott International.</p> <p>Good results from <strong>Ted Baker</strong> pushed its shares 7.5p higher to 921p and helped lift <strong>Next</strong> 93p to \u00a335.92 and <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> 3.7p to 365.5p.</p> <p>A few days after cherry picking the stores it wanted from stricken rival JJB, Mike Ashley's <strong>Sports Direct International </strong>hosted an analyst visit to its Shirebrook headquarters, and it seems to have gone well. The company's shares climbed 22.8p to an all time high of 382.8p and Seymour Pierce said:</p> <blockquote> We were a buyer and supporter of the stock all the way up from 35p to the 300p level when we moved to hold in April 2012 as we were concerned about the valuation. Following the analyst visit yesterday, we are upgrading our recommendation to buy and raising our price target to 420p. We came back reassured that in particular the internet strategy is taking shape, is picking up momentum and is a major focus of management. We are also coming to believe that the company could be a major force in the sporting goods category on the internet not only in the UK but also overseas. </blockquote> <p><strong>Mitchells &amp; Butlers</strong> added 8.6p to 301p after horseracing tycoons JP McManus and John Magnier bought 7m shares in the pubs group through their Elpida vehicle, taking their stake to 22.47%.

  "<p>Sir Clive Woodward has stood down from his role as director of sport at the British Olympic Association after six years, finally drawing a line under persistent speculation about his position at the organisation. The man who coached England to the Rugby World Cup triumph in 2003 has been at the BOA since 2006, when he was hired on a hefty salary by the outgoing chairman Lord Moynihan as part of a modernisation drive.</p> <p>Woodward initially focused on a wide-ranging support scheme for athletes that was later refined into the British Olympic Coaching Programme to aid its support staff in the wake of concerns from UK Sport about duplication of effort.</p> <p>The \u00a31.7m scheme was further downsized to concentrate on sports, such as shooting, which received less support from UK Sport before being put on ice permanently in January last year, amid continued financial concerns.</p> <p>Instead, Woodward took on a role as director of sport and was one of four deputy chef de missions in London beneath the BOA chief executive and Team GB chef de mission, Andy Hunt. He concentrated on devising a code of conduct and \"One Team GB\" ethos for the 550-strong Olympic team and helped oversee a support system that produced its best performance at a Games in more than a century.</p> <p>Immediately after the Games, Woodward said he was keen to remain involved in the run-up to Rio 2016 but has since reconsidered his position amid ongoing uncertainty about the future of the BOA. \"Post-London 2012 is the right time for me to leave the BOA, which is now taking a new direction following a home Games and I wish them all well in the future,\" he said.</p> <p>Woodward said he would continue to chair a British Judo post-Games review, as well as taking up a role as a Team GB ambassador and retaining his position on the International Olympic Committee entourage commission. \"I will now be concentrating on my coaching, corporate speaking, media and other business interests.\"</p> <p>Moynihan said Woodward's contribution was a \"major factor\" in the success of British athletes in Beijing and London. Moynihan announced immediately after the Olympics that he intended to stand down as chairman a year early, with the London 2012 chairman Lord Coe the strong favourite to replace him when a vote is taken on 7 November.</p> <p>Ahead of the change, Hunt has presented a restructuring plan to the board designed to streamline the number of senior staff and save money. Under the plan, the number of divisional directors will be reduced from 11 to seven and the overall headcount from 87 to 52, including an unspecified number of redundancies.</p> <p>Woodward will remain involved with the BOA in an ambassadorial role and is likely to be used as part of an ongoing attempt to bring in new sponsors, with the rights to the Olympic rings that were subcontracted to Locog reverting to the organisation at the end of the year.</p> <p>However, of a number of new sponsorship deals under negotiation only an agreement with Adidas has beenpublicly announced for the next four-year period. The large investment in sending a team to a home Games, coupled with the poor sales of BOA scarves and collectable medallions designed to raise money, have exacerbated existing financial concerns.</p> <p>Accounts for 2011 published on Thursday show the BOA has extended its \u00a34m overdraft to \u00a35m until April. In the accounts, it says \"headroom\" against its borrowing facility is \"limited\" for the final quarter of 2012 and the first of 2013. But two sponsorship deals \u2013 understood to be the Adidas contract and one with the IOC's marketing partners \u2013 have already raised \u00a313m over the next four years.</p> <p>Woodward's role at the BOA has consistently come under scrutiny, amid persistent rumours that he would return to rugby. Conjecture over whether he would go back to Twickenham was at the heart of the complex row that led to the ousting of the former RFU chief executive John Steele last June.</p> <p>Debate over the role of Woodward came to symbolise the wider arguments across the sporting landscape about the role of the BOA. It is traditionally responsible for the British team during the Olympics, but Moynihan and Hunt were keen to expand its role. Yet their ambitions often raised the hackles of UK Sport, the body charged with investing in governing bodies responsible for Olympic sport. Coe may yet approach Woodward to take on the chef de mission's role for the Sochi 2014 and Rio 2016 Games on a part-time basis. The arrival of Coe as chairman is also likely to place the role of Hunt under renewed scrutiny.</p> <p>The annual accounts, for the year to 31 December 2011, show that the BOA made a small loss of \u00a3421,000 compared with a profit of almost \u00a3236,000 the previous year. But it is the current year's finances, including the \u00a313m cost of sending 550 athletes and 450 support staff to the Games, that will prove more challenging.</p>",
  "<p>For romantic novelist and poet Sir Walter Scott it was a massive fortress which was at the heart of his epic poem,<em>The Bridal of Triermain</em>.

The company has erected warning signs below the crag and installed tell-tales which detect rock movement. When I contacted Stephen Reid for and update and asked him to outline the extent of the problem and the potential impact of a rock fall he warned:</p> <blockquote> <p>If it goes it will affect all the routes on the left-hand side of North Crag as well as the two girdles. This includes North Crag Eliminate and Overhanging Bastion. It may also affect Zig Zag as I imagine there will be debris all over the easy ledge pitch.</p> </blockquote> <p>He ended by telling me:</p> <blockquote> <p>It would appear that the tell-tale is showing an outwards movement of almost a centimetre since July which is worrying.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397191341\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/4/1349352961597/zigzag.jpg\" alt=\"zigzag climb\" width=\"220\" height=\"293\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Climber Zig Zag'.

One of the effects of water accumulating in rock fissures in winter is its tendency to freeze and expand.

  "<p>As Democrats and Republicans engaged in a fierce battle of spin and damage control in the wake of the first presidential debate, there was one area of general consensus: moderator Jim Lehrer was the big loser.</p> <p>The veteran journalist, currently the executive editor of PBS Newshour, may have been hosting his twelfth such debate but he faced a blistering level of criticism for his performance.</p> <p>Lehrer was accused of allowing the candidates to ride roughshod over the debate's rules, failing to enforce time limits that had been agreed upon beforehand and generally letting the entire discussion drift off topic and failing to impose himself on either Barack Obama or Mitt Romney.</p> <p>\"He didn't follow up. Today, moderators are expected to be aggressive: they're going to ask a question, they throw it out there, they don't just say a topic. They ask a question,\" said MSNBC anchor Chris Matthews.</p> <p>Huffington Post writer Howard Fineman also slammed Lehrer. \"Jim Lehrer was practically useless as the moderator,\" <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/10/media-piles-on-moderator-jim-lehrer-137473.html\">Fineman said on MSNBC</a>.</p> <p>On social media the poor reviews of Lehrer's performance were no better.</p> <p>\"Definitely Lehrer's last debate,\" said New York Review of Books political writer Michael Tomasky <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mtomasky/status/253680938242953217\">on his Twitter account</a>.</p> <p>\"Regardless of who is winning this debate, Jim Lehrer is losing,\" said a tweet from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danabrams/statuses/253667303227531264\">ABC News analyst Dan Abrams</a>.</p> <p>Late-night comedian and major Democratic donor Bill Maher was typically blunt. \"Lehrer sucked,\" he tweeted. Former New York Times editor Bill Keller went even further, referring to Lehrer as \"roadkill\" and giving his performance a D grade.</p> <p>Conservatives also piled in, their criticism perhaps making it unlikely that Lehrer, 78, will ever be asked to moderate such a high-profile debate again. \"Romney just ran right over Lehrer,\" tweeted conservative talk show host Dana Loesch. Fellow conservative media figure, Laura Ingraham, tweeted Lehrer was \"a bit overwhelmed\".</p> <p>Attention focused on Lehrer's seeming inability to get the candidates to restrict themselves to the questions he asked and the broad nature of some of queries. When Lehrer tried to move on from the first segment, Romney cut him off by saying: \"I get the last word of this segment.\"</p> <p>Later in the debate Obama also shrugged off Lehrer's attempts to keep the candidates in line when he pointed out the president had used up his allotted two minutes. Obama snapped that he \"\u2026 had five seconds before you interrupted me\" and then proceeded to talk for at least another half a minute.</p> <p>The delays in the debate got so bad that the final segment \u2013 meant to last fifteen minutes \u2013 only got three minutes. Nor was that just down to Obama and Romney embarking on long monologues. At one stage Lehrer himself took up a valuable 51 seconds to ask a single question.</p> <p>But Lehrer was not entirely without defenders.</p> <p>In a blogpost, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/post/jim-lehrer-a-stand-in-for-american-dissatisfaction-with-media/2012/10/03/050bad70-0dcc-11e2-bb5e-492c0d30bff6_blog.html\">Washington Post columnist Erik Wemple</a> jumped his defence and said the tidal wave of criticism for his performance had been overblown.</p> <p>\"The debate was excellent \u2014 free-flowing, multi-topical, informative and civil,\" he wrote. He added that Lehrer's inability to enforce time limits had not been a problem in sparking an interesting exchange of ideas and points of view.</p> <p>Wemple praised the candidates for their ideas and added: \"Lehrer, though, deserves a nod as well. He moderated the thing, after all. Much of the vitriol headed his way grinds at his inability to enforce time limits, which are arbitrary and dumb anyhow.\"</p>",

  "<p><strong>What are the aims and interests of University Alliance (UA)?</strong></p> <p>Universities Alliance represents 24 universities which are business-connected and business-focused. Our members include the large ex-polytechnics, and also universities that are very regionally located; we often work with industry sectors that are relevant to the region. We have a focus on placement opportunities, asking industry experts what graduate skills sets they are looking for, and what knowledge they require. We have lots of conversations with treasury ministers, and are working very closely with <a href=\"http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/Pages/Default.aspx\" title=\"\">Universities UK</a> to make sure that we present a solution-focused approach to our commentary.</p> <p><strong>How much, as both a vice-chancellor and the chair of UA, has the policy environment and also the economic environment in which universities now operate shaped what you do?</strong></p> <p>The policy context that we are currently working with is concerned with the here and now, but universities play a very long game in terms of creating futures and opportunities. I have been trying to paint a picture of higher education that acknowledges where we are at the moment, but also recognises that the knowledge economy is the economy that we are trying to grow. That means challenging future areas of investment as a country, looking for more graduates and more highly skilled workers, and changing the profile of what our workforce in the UK looks like.</p> <p>My disappointment is that the focus [of policy] has been negative \u2013 worrying about fees and how to control student numbers. In the short term this is hugely important, but we need to be having a conversation about our longer term provisions and plans. How do we create a workforce who are able to engage with the changing world, a workforce that has the knowledge, skills and attributes to allow them to be flexible, and who are entrepreneurial in their approach and who can change over time, and who can build future economies? That in itself is a big challenge.</p> <p><strong>Is that a challenge that transcends </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/sep/26/mission-groups-university-branding\" title=\"\"><strong>mission groups</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p> <p>There is one authoritative voice for universities in Britain, and that is Universities UK. The role of the mission groups is to celebrate the diversity of UK higher education, and to profile it to policy makers and the public. If additional variability is introduced through public-private partnerships, it must be clear that they are governed and must meet all of the current requirements for existing universities.</p> <p>Mission groups have an important role to play, and where they tend to challenge each other is where policy that is being developed advantages or disadvantages any particular group. For example, UA is quite clear in that research excellence should be funded regardless of the institution or mission group. World class research is world class research, whether it is occurring in a research-intensive university or in another other sort of university.</p> <p><strong>University Alliance's latest project, </strong><a href=\"http://universityvision.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>university-vision</strong></a><strong>, aims to break down the divides between mission groups. Can you elaborate on how this might be done?</strong></p> <p>The future of learning, teaching and research is too important to be polarised by differences in views between mission groups. We've created a project which sets out, first and foremost, not to be something that is just owned by UA and havee held meetings which were purposely cut across mission groups. There needs to be a dialogue with policy thinkers, policy makers and the public around what the purpose of a university is, how we want to fund university education in the future, and how we want universities to behave \u2013 both with each other and with industry \u2013 going forward. The aim of this was to try and form some scenarios which could be used to challenge current thinking in higher education.</p> <p><strong>Do you have any sense of how well these ideas are being received within the sector?</strong></p> <p>Those who are engaging with it think it is really interesting. Now, we want to have something out there that people can engage with, that explains both what we are trying to do and the work we have done so far. We have a website, through which people can <a href=\"http://universityvision.org.uk/contribute/\" title=\"\">contribute to the thinking around these scenarios</a>. We also want to influence some of the thinking in the run-up to the next general election, in 2015.</p> <p><strong>So is that the point at which we can measure the success of university-vision \u2013 by the influence it's had on the party line regarding higher education?</strong></p> <p>Yes. By that point, we will also see how far we have moved on from the current debate, which is preoccupied with student number control and funding. The important thing, again, is that we start to think about the long term future, and we don't get caught up in only worrying about what's going to happen in the next one or two years.</p> <p><strong>Is that your message to university leaders: focus on the long term and not the short?</strong></p> <p>Politics is rooted in today and it's important that we focus on getting the here and now right for our students and staff. However, universities have been around a long time, but political parties come and go. Universities need to continually challenge themselves in terms of what they are about and what they do, but we also need to acknowledge that we are about knowledge creation, knowledge application, and through that, improving the health and welfare of our nation.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>In September 1962, the Beatles went into EMI's Abbey Road studios in north London to record their first single. The A-side was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEEC-yhr_Ks\" title=\"\">Love Me Do</a>, one of the least original in John Lennon and Paul McCartney's burgeoning songbook. Through it ran a harmonica riff played by Lennon and shamelessly cribbed from Bruce Channel's recent hit, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4w1Mp6Mce4\" title=\"\">Hey Baby</a>. The lyrics were rudimentary: \"Love, love me do \u2026 you know I love you \u2026 I'll always be true.\" No one then recognised a sound with power to change the world.</p> <p>Brian Epstein, the Beatles' newly appointed manager, had hawked the band around almost every other London record company before striking lucky with the small Parlophone label. Parlophone's boss, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Martin\" title=\"\">George Martin</a>, had previously been best known for releasing comedy records with Peter Sellers and the Goons, but was looking for a \"beat group\" in the mould of Cliff Richard and the Shadows.</p> <p>In those days, recording studios had the clinical atmosphere of laboratories and the producer's word was law. At the Beatles' audition three months earlier, Martin had ordained their first release: not a Lennon-McCartney composition but <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kHml65dS3g\" title=\"\">How Do You Do It?</a> by \"professional\" songwriter <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Murray\" title=\"\">Mitch Murray</a>. When they returned in September, Martin yielded to their pleas to record Love Me Do rather than How Do You Do It? (which later became a number one for fellow Liverpudlians Gerry and the Pacemakers.)</p> <p>The single was released on October 5, 1962, with barely any promotion from EMI. The (well-substantiated) story goes that Epstein ordered 10,000 copies for his Liverpool record shop, enough to push it into the Top 20 and 10 times more than he could ever sell. It also became a dance favourite throughout Britain's two ballroom chains, Mecca and Top Rank. Even so, it got no higher than number 17.</p> <p>For the Beatles, its real importance was cementing their relationship with George Martin, a producer who was to be of crucial importance to the end of their collective career. When they returned to Abbey Road with a new Lennon-McCartney song, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGZx46cMt98\" title=\"\">Please Please Me</a>, Martin offered no objection. At the end of the session, he told them: \"Gentlemen, you have just made your first number one.\" And he was right.</p> <p>Just as importantly, it gained the band their first exposure on national television with their wacky mop-tops and round-collared suits. In 1962, broadcasters still regarded pop music as deeply disreputable, if not dangerous. After some press furore over their haircuts, however, the Beatles' cheeky but deferential charm captivated the whole nation. From now on, pop would become a guaranteed audience-boost for TV and radio, as it would prove to be a guaranteed circulation-boost for newspapers.</p> <p>And after Love Me Do, the British music business would be transformed. Young musicians would increasingly write their own songs, like Lennon and McCartney, breaking the immemorial hold of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_Pan_Alley\" title=\"\">Tin Pan Alley</a> \"moon-and-June\" hacks. The despotism of producers would dwindle as bands increasingly demanded to choose their own material, like the Beatles did, and have input into their own sessions. Studios changed from clinical laboratories into rehearsal-rooms with constantly-running tape and, ultimately, venues for partying and drug-taking.</p> <p>As youth took control of its own music, so it rapidly did in other creative spheres \u2013 fashion, photography, design, theatre and the cinema. Britain's remaining industries would hastily retool themselves to turn out consumer goods with youth principally in mind. The Swinging Sixties \u2013 an epoch which has obsessed every subsequent generation \u2013 had arrived, and would spread to Europe, America and then, in greater or lesser strength, across the globe .</p> <p>In the Beatles' astonishing oeuvre, Love Me Do may seem merely like a rough charcoal sketch prefiguring their later Renaissance masterpieces. But it gave birth to a whole era, one that we still can't bear to let go.</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B009K58DW8/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B009K58DW8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=guardianunlim-21\" title=\"\">The Beatles: A Band Reviewed</a>, a new anthology of the Guardian and Observer's coverage of the band, is now available as an ebook for \u00a31.99</p>",
  "<p>The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, has claimed that migration of low-skilled workers into the UK is too high.</p> <p>Miliband, riding high after a widely-praised party conference speech calling for a return to \"one nation\" politics, rejected the government's immigration caps as a solution because they did not cover workers arriving from the European Union.</p> <p>Instead he told the BBC's World at One radio programme in an end-of-conference interview that tougher and better enforced employment rights would help protect both immigrants and local workers from gangmasters and other unscrupulous bosses.</p> <p>\"I'd like it to be the case that employers didn't find they have vacancies they don't believe they can fill, so what they reach for is low skill migration.\"</p> <p>Miliband said a belief that Labour did not protect workers from the challenge of migration was one of four key reasons the party lost power in 2010.</p> <p>The other three reasons he highlighted were the poor performance of the economy, lack of focus on school-leavers who did not go to university, and the power of vested interests.</p> <p>The deficit and public debt were both lower in 2010 than when Labour replaced the previous Conservative government in 1997, said Miliband.</p> <p>The Labour leader defended his decision to join a TUC march against cuts next month, despite warning on Tuesday that Labour would have to cut public spending.</p> <p>The Tory-Liberal Democrat austerity programme had gone too far, said Miliband.</p> <p>\"When we are in power there would be some cuts, but we'll make sure this economy would be growing,\" he added.</p> <p>The Labour leader also, again, played down divisions with his older brother, David, whom he unexpectedly beat in the party's leadership contest two years ago.</p> <p>Miliband said he had discussed Tuesday's speech with his brother beforehand, and would welcome him back onto the frontbench when he was ready.</p> <p>\"Yes the contest was a difficult time for us: we're over it,\" he said.</p> <p>Polls on Thursday indicated that Miliband's bravura no-notes speech, in which he attempted to claim the political centre ground by stealing the \"one nation\" mantle from moderate Tories, had boosted his standing with voters as a potential prime minister.</p> <p>Closing the conference, the deputy Labour leader, Harriet Harman, told delegates Miliband had fired the \"starting gun\" for the next general election with his speech. .</p> <p>She also gave the first insight into the party's strategy, revealing that shadow cabinet ministers would pair with candidates in marginal seats to help them campaign.</p>",

For years now, the ISS has been dodging collisions. Some of the latest manoeuvres took place in <a href=\"http://blogs.esa.int/atv/2011/04/02/atv-boosts-iss-safely-away-from-space-debris/\">April 2011</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-01/13/iss-to-dodge-junk\">January 2012</a>. What may not be so obvious is that many of its \"near-misses\" are due to fragments from a single event in 2009 that shocked the aerospace community. </p> <p>On 10 February that year, the defunct Russian military communications satellite Kosmos 2251 struck the solar panel of Iridium 33, a commercial American communications satellite. The panel shattered and Iridium 33 tumbled out of control. Kosmos 2251 disintegrated.</p> <p>The catastrophe created more than 2,000 pieces of space debris with sizes greater than 10 centimetres, and potentially hundreds of thousands of smaller fragments that cannot currently be tracked from Earth. To put the trackable debris into perspective, about 10% of all known space debris accumulated over the past 55 years comes from the 2009 Kosmos-Iridium collision. </p> <p>Fragments as small as a single centimetre have the potential to destroy whole satellites because of the speed at which they are travelling. This is because the energy of a collision is overwhelmingly determined by the speed at which things strike each other. (Who else remembers that half-mass-times-velocity-squared equation of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy\">kinetic energy</a>?)</p> <p>Typical orbital velocities can be tens of thousands of kilometres per hour. In the case of Kosmos and Iridium, the collision speed was 42,100km/hr.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dtT3pTh_q-8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"258\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dtT3pTh_q-8?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The reason Kosmos-Iridium shocked the aerospace community was that it was a definite step towards a nightmare scenario that had been proposed in 1978 and is known as the Kessler syndrome. </p> <p>Back then, NASA employee Donald Kessler, together with colleague Burton Cour-Palais, proposed that as the number of satellites rose, so would the risk of accidental collisions. The resulting debris would take out further satellites, sparking a chain reaction that would swiftly encircle the planet with a vast cloud of debris. Orbits would then become unusable because anything placed up there would be sandblasted into smithereens, exacerbating the problem. Eventually our <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727772.300-space-junk-hunting-zombies-in-outer-space.html?full=true\">access to space would be lost</a>.</p> <p>The Chinese started us down the path to the Kessler Syndrome in 2007, when they destroyed one of their own satellites with a missile. It was a test designed to show the West that China had an anti-satellite capability, but it has left a cloud of debris containing 3,000 trackable particles.</p> <p>So, why aren't we launching special satellites to clean up space? Firstly, because it is sensitive politically: a satellite, even a defunct one, remains the property of the people who launched it. So you can't just start pulling objects out of the sky, even if they pose a danger to your spacecraft. Secondly, there is an obviously military side to all this. If you have the capability to push a dead satellite out of orbit, you could use the same method to take down a live one.</p> <p>This is a knotty legal, political and military problem. Work is proceeding at the various space agencies around the world; notably as part of <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/esaMI/SSA/index.html\">ESA's Space Situational Awareness Programme</a> and independently at <a href=\"http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/\">NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office</a>. </p> <p>Time is of the essence. <a href=\"http://www.douglasadams.com/\">Douglas Adams</a> famously said \"space is big\", which is true when you consider the whole universe. However, the space around Earth is not, and we are filling it more fully every day.

  "<p>Local government lacks independence despite the promise of localism because it is trapped by a constitutional bond which must be broken to release councils from central control, critics have warned.</p> <p>Speaking about the future of local government at a Labour party conference fringe session this week, Colin Copus, professor of local politics at De Montfort University, said today's councils had little control over their own destiny.</p> <p>\"Councils aren't really government; they are not able to control what goes on in their areas, they're not independent politically, they are creatures of statute,\" he said. \"I often think to myself that I would rather do anything else today than be an elected member ... I don't think now, if I started my life again, I would want to be a councillor at 22 because I wouldn't want to do someone else's dirty work.\"</p> <p>Keith Wakefield, leader of Leeds city council, shared figures which suggested 91% of local government spending was still controlled at the centre.</p> <p>\"We are not free to generate our own income and decide on priorities. What we're seeing is a financial shift between local government being rewarded on needs to local government being financed by market forces,\" he said. \"Won't get freedom without financial independence.\"</p> <p>However, Wakefield admitted to remaining optimistic about the future of local government, claiming a government select committee inquiry into the issue of independence had raised the profile and status of local government staff and councillors.</p> <p>The political and constitutional reform committee, chaired by Nottingham Labour MP Graham Allen, is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2012/jun/27/lga-conference-independent-local-government?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">campaigning for new legislation</a> which, if passed, which would enshrine the independence of councils from the centre in law \u2013 a \"Magna Carta for local government\".</p> <p>Allen told the fringe meeting that it was up to local government to fight for its right to independence as no other western democracy \"put up with its local government being a vassal or a slave\".</p> <p>But he said the debate over Scottish independence would offer the chance to reignite the argument over what localism means for councils. \"The only institution that can seize this agenda is local government. Local government has an opportunity as this issue comes up the agenda in the debate around the referendum in Scotland. Devo-max for local government in England will become an issue,\" he added. \"What's next for localism? It's us demanding our independence.\"</p> <p>Phillip Blond, director of the thinktank <a href=\"http://www.respublica.org.uk/\" title=\"\">ResPublica</a>, which hosted the debate, said the case for independence was still to be made on both the left and right of politics, but the two camps needed to hear different arguments.</p> <p>While centre right politicians needed to understand the link between strong local politics and economic growth, leftwing MPs needed to be reassured that localism wouldn't cause a 'postcode lottery' leading to a widening gap between rich and poor communities.</p> <p>\"The standard claim of parties on the left is that in order to deliver equal services we have to deliver the same things in the same way, and if we don't, we have inequality. But if you do this you actually get inequality. We have to treat people differently in order to create equality,\" Blond said.</p> <p>\"What you're going to need to do is talk about the limits of the localism act.

  "<p>A magazine recently canvassed the opinions of Tame Impala's Australian mastermind Kevin Parker on the differences between his second album Lonerism and its predecessor, Innerspeaker. On the face of it a straightforward query, but Parker required three goes at the answer, a state of affairs that led the journalist to compare him with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll7rWiY5obI\" title=\"\">Nigel Tufnel of Spinal Tap</a>. First he suggested Lonerism contained \"melodies that beam at you rather than wash over you\". Then he reconsidered, suggesting instead that its songs were \"more like an explosion rather than a wave\". And then he decided the&#xa0;new songs were quite like a wave after all: \"Like waves that hit you rather than you swimming in an ocean of melody,\" he offered, adding a hopeful \"know what I mean?\"</p> <p>This is all in keeping with the image of Parker as a kind of heavy-lidded auteur, a man who sings and plays every note on Tame Impala's records in his Perth bedroom and spent a significant proportion of his debut album bemoaning the deleterious effects of his drug intake on his personal life. \"I&#xa0;wanted her, but she doesn't like the life I lead,\" <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUq3oc0lYbw\" title=\"\">he wailed</a>, \"sitting around smoking weed.\" That he might cure his romantic agony at a stroke by spending a little less time sitting around smoking weed had apparently not occurred to&#xa0;him, but that's the logic of the committed stoner for you.</p> <p>But, as Nigel Tufnell once opined, there's a very fine line between stupid and clever. And for all Parker seems to enjoy playing the pothead pixie \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9vWoPucA10\" title=\"\">YouTube trailer for Lonerism</a> consists of live footage intercut with Parker going \"errrm\" and \"what was I going to&#xa0;say?\" \u2013 Tame Impala's albums seem very clever indeed. Psychedelia's ongoing appeal to musicians is understandable \u2013 there's something seductive about the restless pioneering spirit of&#xa0;rock music in 1966/67 \u2013 but to the latterday artist it's less a genre than a conundrum. It's supposed to be transcendent, innovative, unbound, futuristic. Equally, it's a genre that's become codified, sonically defined by noises that were the cutting-edge in technology and taste 45 years ago: tapes played backwards and out of phase, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKqSg-A2eRk\" title=\"\">wah pedals</a>, Eastern-influenced drones, the reedy tones of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDxp18Q_hgY\" title=\"\">the Farfisa Compact organ</a>. If you're minded to make more than a pastiche, to do something other than rearrange a load of cliches, you're going to have to find a way of reconciling its sound with its forward-thinking ethos. Not an easy job, but like its predecessor, Lonerism pulls it off.</p> <p>It certainly contains a lot of what you might call psychedelic psignifiers. The drums are usually a fidgety take on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tisjsgsgtZU\" title=\"\">the Tomorrow Never Knows tumble</a>; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YGNdAQsI4o\" title=\"\">Keep on Lying</a> ends with some mournful organ that sounds exactly like something Richard Wright might have <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fewKkYEgFM\" title=\"\">played on the first Pink Floyd album</a>; Nothing That Has Happened So Far Has Been Anything We Can Control and Mind Mischief are bathed in phasing effects, their sound panning from speaker to speaker. Moreover, it displays an innate understanding of psychedelia, not least in its balance between the beatific and the bleak: from White Rabbit to Arnold Layne to A Day in the Life, the best psych records were always more gritty and troubled than the popular cartoon of the serene peace-sign-flashing flower child suggested. Here, Gotta Be Above It seems to be a musical depiction of an on stage panic attack, with its whispering voice, jumpy drums and ominous electronics. Meanwhile the melody of Why Won't They Talk to Me? is as beautiful and its echo-laden sound as spacey as the song's tone is dark: as is perhaps inevitable if you make your albums alone in one of the most remote cities in the world, Parker seems to have a lot to say about isolation and loneliness, and he says it rather more eloquently than his public image might suggest. But Lonerism never really sounds retro, slathered as it is with electronics. Virtually every instrument is caked in distortion, but not the warm, familiar fuzz of an overdriven amplifier. It feels digital, alien, the sound of modern machines going wrong.</p> <p>All this is underpinned by genuinely great songwriting. People tend to describe Parker's melodies as Lennonesque, which in the era of Beady Eye sounds an oddly backhanded compliment, like shorthand for saying he's not trying at all. But the Lennon he evokes is the author of Happiness Is a Warm Gun and Julia, blessed with an innate pop sensibility, but always searching for the unforeseen chord, the unexpected melodic shift. Ultimately, on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0jqPvpn3sY\" title=\"\">Elephant</a>'s warped bovver-glam or the unsettling mix of piano ballad and ferociously noisy guitar soloing that is album closer <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLKuM1aAfwQ\" title=\"\">Sun's Coming Up</a>, Tame Impala just sound like Tame Impala: delving into the past in order to drag it into the future. No wonder the man at the centre of it all has a hard time describing what he's doing.</p>",
  "<p>What started in March with the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/mar/28/mlb-us-sport1\">Seattle Mariners and Oakland Athletics</a> playing in Tokyo has come to a close here in October. Playoff baseball is upon us, meaning the regular season is complete - 162 games played by 30 Major League teams - which to some may seem like a lot, but to baseball fans is as perfect a number as you can get. It seems like it began yesterday, but strangely, at the same time, it also feels like a long time ago. Remember when the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/05/sports/baseball/on-opening-day-marlins-stadium-overshadows-their-play.html?_r=0\">Miami Marlins</a> were a big deal? When <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/los-angeles/mlb/columns/story?id=6605429\">Mike Trout</a> and Bryce Harper weren't playing big league ball? When <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/may/04/mariano-rivera-torn-acl-new-york-yankees\">Mariano Rivera</a> was closing games? A long time ago. Then again, there is so much action over the course of a six month season that it can just fly by, that is, unless you are in Boston. We've had <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/16/felix-hern-ndez-perfect-game-seattle-mariners\">perfect games</a>,<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jun/02/johan-santana-mets-no-hitter-new-york?INTCMP=SRCH\"> no-hitters</a>, underdogs one-upping establishments, PED controversies, text message scandals, courtroom drama,<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/aug/26/los-angeles-dodgers-boston-red-sox-blockbuster-trade\"> blockbuster deals</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/04/new-york-yankees-miguel-cabrera-triple-crown\">a triple crown winner</a> (a rarity regardless what you think of it), a four home run game, milestones, some <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/sep/19/los-angeles-dodgers-pittsburgh-pirates-philadelphia-phillies-cy-young-kris-medlen\">incredible seasons from pitchers</a> and the usual assortment of <a href=\"http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/fancave/blog.jsp?content=article&amp;content_id=38313880#fbid=EhGIRCFbx2u\">out-of-this-world defense</a> mixed in with some wild comebacks. </p> <p>That was yesterday, now we move to the next stage, the playoffs. For the first time we have ten teams, with the two wild-card teams playing a single game for the right to move on to the Divisional Series. It works, and it means that Friday is going to make for a phenomenal day of baseball. Before we get to the ten teams that made the initial cut, I just want to say one thing. There has been some talk that the best team in baseball is not in these playoffs. Yes, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim are an immensely talented group of players, but they had <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/2012-standings.shtml\">162 games</a> to prove they belong in the postseason and they failed. How can you call a team like that the best team in baseball? I don't see them in the below matchups. </p> <h2>American League</h2> <p><strong>Wild-Card game - Friday 8:30PM ET</strong></p> <p>Baltimore Orioles @ Texas Rangers</p> <p><strong>ALDS</strong></p> <p>Oakland Athletics vs. Detroit Tigers<br>New York Yankees vs. winner of Wild-Card game</p> <h2>National League</h2> <p><strong>Wild-Card game - Friday 5:00PM ET</strong></p> <p>St Louis Cardinals @ Atlanta Braves </p> <p><strong>NLDS</strong></p> <p>Cincinnati Reds vs. San Francisco Giants<br>Washington Nationals vs. winner of Wild-Card game</p> <p><a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/postseasonpicture.jsp\">Check out the full playoff bracket </a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/04/mlb-playoffs-schedule-2012\">And the full playoff schedule</a></p> <h2>American League Preview</h2> <p><strong>Baltimore Orioles</strong></p> <p>There were analysts chatting on a certain network, wondering on Wednesday how the Orioles would do in the playoffs because they are not a deep team, their starting pitching is poor, and, somewhat bizarrely, this duo kept on bringing up Nate McClouth as a weakness \"and they have Nate McLouth! Ha Ha.\" (.871 OPS in September, out of nowhere). </p> <p>What? In case you haven't noticed, the Baltimore Orioles haven't had any of this stuff all season long, and now you want to start telling us what they don't have for the playoffs? Are you on serious? Of course they don't have any of that, that's why they are so amazing, because they win without. </p> <p>This team is incredible, mostly because, as a good friend and longtime Orioles fan told me this week, \"This team could come back next year and lose 100 games.\" Perhaps a bit of an exaggeration for sure, but he's absolutely right. So much had to go right for Baltimore to win 93 games that it could very easily fall way down the hill in 2013. Yet this team has come together in 2012 in a way that no one, even the Orioles, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/mar/30/mlb-2012-preview-american-league\">could have possibly conceived back in April</a>. The A's have all this incredible young pitching. What do the Orioles, a team that hasn't had a sniff of success since 1997, actually have? Answer - an amazing bullpen, particularly Jim Johnson, Adam Jones and a great manager. That and a lot of mojo has been enough for the Orioles to go 16-2 in extra inning games and a staggering 29-9 in one-run games. Virtually every move made by management this season helped Buck Showalter get a team that doesn't field well, that is eighth in runs scored and ninth in starting pitching ERA, into the playoffs, scaring the living crap out of the Yankees in the process, nearly overcoming a ten-game deficit in the AL East by going 20-10 down the stretch. It's a tough call for AL Manager of the Year with Bob Melvin out there but it's got to be Buck Showalter, only because he had less than Melvin. </p> <p>Facts, as pointed out by the Oriole fan mentioned above: no one in their rotation would make the Yankees rotation, no O's outfielder would make the Angels outfield. Their best hitter, Nick Markakis has been out with a broken thumb since early September. There is no .300 hitter, no 40 home run hitter, no 13 game winner, never mind a 15 or 20 game winner. Jim Thome is their regular DH. Yet they win, all the time. If you want to doubt these guys now then go ahead, be my guest. I'm done with that. </p> <p><strong>Texas Rangers</strong></p> <p>Choke: To fail to perform effectively because of nervous agitation or tension, especially in an athletic contest.</p> <p>This seems to describe the Texas Rangers perfectly. When you have a<a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/games/standings.cgi?date=2012-09-24\"> five game lead </a>on September 24 and then find yourself in second place on October 3, you choked, period, full-stop. I tell you what, this team is damn lucky that they didn't fall out of this thing completely - they could have easily been hanging out with the Los Angeles Angels right now, but instead, they have a chance to resurrect a season that is on the brink of being lost. They lost seven out of their final nine games, including five to the crazy people in Oakland, <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=25310631&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_25310631&amp;v=3\">blowing a 5-1 lead</a> on the final day of the season to the A's, handing them a division that has been theirs for back-to-back seasons. </p> <p>All of this is exacerbated by that<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/oct/28/rangers-cardinals-world-series-live-6\"> little el-choke-o they had back in Game Six of the World Series</a> last year. If they can't beat Baltimore, people are going to start talking, and there will be a real danger that all the good that Texas have done to turn around this franchise will get tied up in <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=cursed/041029\">supernatural sports conspiracy theories.</a> In that sense, this game on Friday is bigger than any they played in the last two years - the reputation of the franchise is on the line. So, that offense which has been brought back to earth, the pitching (Yu Darvish will start vs. Baltimore) which completely collapsed over the past week better get it together, and fast. </p> <p><strong>Oakland Athletics</strong></p> <p>What can you say - we gush over the Oakland A's. They play in a dump, in front of no one, for an owner the locals detest, one who is trying to move them away, they have no money, a tiny payroll, and they win. They win big. It's awesome. </p> <p>The City of Oakland has always been a counter-culture kind of place, and that continues with this ballclub, and that's because for everything they don't have, they DO have Billy Beane, who has outdone himself - again. Bless his soul for turning the sport on its head, winning baseball's toughest division, with a bunch of kids, many of which he dealt for during a major re-structuring last winter. For sure, to be young and stupid can help. The A's squeezed 54 wins out of pitchers that are 25 years old or younger, many of them rookies, hurlers that were too naive to know they have no business unseating a team like the Texas Rangers. Not surprisingly, Bob Melvin's team never gave up, certainly not when they were <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/games/standings.cgi?date=2012-06-30\">13 games out of first place</a> on June 30, poised to resume their battle with the Mariners for third place, and certainly not in the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CCgQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fbleacherreport.com%2Farticles%2F1352623-oakland-athletics-get-14th-walk-off-win-with-brandon-moss-three-run-homer&amp;ei=355tUNC3IMTS0QWjlIGwCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9HP-tU7LuIVanQnsLRXNUr8AZlQ\">14 games they won in walk-off fashion. </a></p> <p>Yes, there is a flare for the dramatic in Oakland for sure, winning the division on the final day of the season, a day they usually clear out their lockers. The young pitchers are bold and fearless, as are their hitters, so much so that they struck out 1387 times, the most in baseball. They are dangerous, even more so now that they're heading straight to an ALDS. Who wants to face the free-swinging A's, who also happen to hit a lot of home runs, in particular Josh Reddick, Yoenis, Brandon Moss. They have the starters in Jarrod Parker, Travis Blackley, Tommy Milone, A.J. Griffin, and the filthy relief core trio of Ryan Cook, Sean Doolittle and Grant Balfour - the veteran Australian closer. This team has it all, to the surprise of all, and the answer to the obvious question is, why not?</p> <p><strong>New York Yankees</strong></p> <p>Did you really think that they were going to blow it? Were the New York Yankees ever going to finish behind the Baltimore Orioles in the American League East? Of course not. The Bronx Bombers have won yet another Division title. I don't know how many they've won because, well, you know, the Yankees don't really care about those, so why should I bother to look it up? Once the calendar flips to October, there is only one title that matters, and, as usual, the real season starts now for New York, and, as usual, it is one that can only be validated with a parade down Broadway. </p> <p>New York is helped by having their ducks in a row heading into the postseason. Had any sort of AL East one-game showdown or wild-card game taken place, they would have been forced to blow their big guns, starting pitchers C.C. Sabathia and Hiroki Kuroda before heading into an ALDS. Instead, that duo with Andy Pettitte makes for a pretty good core, while their bullpen is good, but without Mariano Rivera, won't be great.<a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/soriara01.shtml\"> Rafael Soriano </a>had a superb season, but we are about to find out first hand just how valuable Rivera was, and don't think there won't be just a bit more sweat on Soriano's upper lip knowing the shoes he has to fill when it matters most. </p> <p>Offensively, they are boom or bust. They can score in bunches, putting up the second most runs in the AL this season. However, they can also go missing for days, as they did in mid-September when the race for the division tightened up. <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=rodrial01&amp;t=b&amp;year=\">Alex Rodriguez</a> had a double on Wednesday night, his first since September 6. He's hit one home run since September 9. Mark Teixeira is back in the lineup after having calf issues, but he has underperformed this season. Ichiro has provided a boost, Derek Jeter has reversed his downward trend, and Cano has been superb. Curtis Granderson has 195 strikeouts, second only to Adam Dunn, but when he does make contact, it usually goes out of the park - he hit 43 homers, tied for second most in baseball. We won't know which Yankees offense shows up until game time of course, but for this aging crew, time is getting shorter. </p> <p><strong>Detroit Tigers<br></strong><br>The Tigers are another team that's lucky to be in the playoffs after a season that really never got going. Detroit won 89 games in a bad division, the AL Central, playing steady but not spectacular baseball since July. If not for the Chicago White Sox late-season slide they may have found themselves on the outside looking in. Now that they are in, they can't be ignored, certainly not with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/04/new-york-yankees-miguel-cabrera-triple-crown\">Miguel Cabrera, who secured the Triple Crown </a>on Wednesday, Prince Fielder, Justin Verlander and Max Scherzer. The question is, after that crew, is the supporting cast powerful enough to propel them past a team that has worked up one heck of a head of steam in the A's? It will be difficult, as Oakland have been tested against the Rangers and Angels all year, while their stiffest divisional rival was Robin Ventura's team that defied expectations for most of the season. Then there's the other side of the coin: here's a team that was awarded the division in March played under immense pressure all season long, and now that they've made it, maybe they won't grip the bat as hard, ease up and finally play the way they were expected to all season long. There's a slice inside many of all of us that roots for anything in Detroit to succeed, and that includes their baseball team, but anything less than an ALCS appearance, after Detroit invested heavily this winter, will be thought of as another sad Motor City failure. </p> <h2>National League Preview</h2> <p><strong>Washington Nationals</strong></p> <p>So there's <a href=\"http://dc.sbnation.com/washington-nationals/2012/10/3/3448484/stephen-strasburg-nationals-playoffs-roster\">no Stephen Strasburg</a>, this we know already. That won't stop manager Davey Johnson from mercilessly attacking his opponents with what he has left, which is quite a lot actually. The team does everything well - they are complete, and deserving winners of the franchise's first NL East title since the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zw1454ALsR4\">Expos won it back in the strike-shortened season of 1981</a>. Six months ago the Nats were supposed to be taking that next step, instead, they have begun a new-era of winning baseball that could be very long and very fruitful. For evidence of that see Bryce Harper, who at 19 years of age was too young to celebrate with champagne when the team clinched the title. </p> <p>The Nationals, who felt some heat down the stretch from Atlanta, but still finished with the best record in all of baseball, will play either St. Louis or Atlanta, but whoever it is, they will have a great shot of winning and moving on. The bats have pop, and they have the second most homers in the NL this season, improving overall in the second half with the help of Mike Morse and Danny Espinosa. </p> <p>The pitching? Well, this is where the big advantage is, even without their ace. Gio Gonzalez and Jordan Zimmerman are as good a one-two punch as any in baseball, but it thins out from there, and at some point, there is a decent chance that Strasburg will be missed. However, if Ross Detwiler and Edwin Jackson can snap out of the funk they are in, who will be able to handle Washington? If there is a looming, potentially dooming factor out there, it's Tyler Clippard or Drew Storen in a big spot, and they will be in big spots this October, without a doubt. </p> <p><strong>Atlanta Braves<br></strong><br>All arms, no sticks - that's the Atlanta Braves. They won 93 ballgames despite their inability to score runs with the best of the National League, and they can thank their pitching staff which was the second best in baseball in the second half, only to the Rays. A big part of that was <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20121002&amp;content_id=39367390&amp;vkey=pr_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb\">Kris Medlen</a>, who moved into the starting rotation on July 31 and really took this staff to another level after they had lost their best starter Brandon Beachy to season ending surgery. All Medlen has done is allow nine runs in 12 starts, which needless to say is completely insane. So is the bullpen, one that stars the devastating Craig Kimbrel. </p> <p>This duo could win the game vs. St. Louis on their own. They may have to because the Braves just don't hit, at all. Not lately.<a href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/sports/columns/bernie-miklasz/bernie-bytes-early-thoughts-on-cards-vs-braves/article_ccf22cf4-0d83-11e2-8fcc-001a4bcf6878.html\"> Good old Bernie Miklasz </a>of the St. Louis Post Dispatch laid out the Braves second half batting situation for us:</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;Jason Heyward has 13 homers, 41 RBIs and a .459 slugging pct.<br>\u2022&#xa0;Freddie Freeman has 12 homers, 45 RBIs and a .467 slug.<br>\u2022&#xa0;Chipper Jones has 8 homers, 29 RBIs and is slugging .432.<br>\u2022&#xa0;Martin Prado is batting .281 with a .334 OBP, .418 slug<br>\u2022&#xa0;Brian McCann is batting .210 with a .291 OBP and .348 slug.<br>\u2022&#xa0;Michael Bourn is batting .226 with a .324 OBP and 81 Ks in 266 at-bats.<br>\u2022&#xa0;Dan Uggla, benched for a time, is batting .217 with 67 Ks in 226 at-bats.</p> <p>In other words, Atlanta's offense sucks, but they may only need to get their pitchers one run, that's how good they've been. Then again, this is the Cardinals we're talking about...</p> <p><strong>St. Louis Cardinals</strong></p> <p>Do you really think the Cardinals are capable of losing the wild-card game? Don't be fooled by their measly win total of 88 - they were amongst the unluckiest teams in baseball this season and that's because, as usual, the St. Louis Cardinals are saving all their luck for the postseason. They sputtered to the finish, nearly letting the sluggish Dodgers, not to mention the Brewers and the Phillies, back into the pennant race. They were just toying with us, again, as usual. Just because <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2011/nov/01/tony-la-russa-retire-cardinals\">Tony La Russa is gone</a> doesn't mean he hasn't installed his powers into new manager Mike Matheny. This team is good, real good, (except for the bullpen) and now they have Chris Carpenter back in their rotation. So, who will St. Louis start in the wild-card game? None other than Kyle Lohse, who shocked onlookers by transforming into an ace in 2012. Still, as good old Bernie points out, many Cardinals fans are unhappy that Matheny tapped Lohse for the big game over Adam Wainwright. They may have a point, but Lohse is a Cy Young candidate, even if you don't really believe it, and if you don't start a Cy Young candidate in a one-game playoff, well, then you are a fool. Can the Cardinals, whose high octane offense outscored the NL this season, get to Medlen? Well, if Carlos Beltran, Yadier Molina, David Freese, Matt Holliday and Allen Craig can't, who can? Because they have the bats, and Atlanta can't hit, and the Cardinals are the Cardinals, expect Atlanta to go home after just one game. </p> <p><strong>San Francisco Giants<br></strong><br>Giants fans can thank <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/report-melky-cabrera-used-fake-website-create-explanation-135323610--mlb.html\">Melky Cabrera</a> for stoking a fire under this team. They were really, really ordinary until Cabrera got done for PED's, and then, just like flicking a switch, it was 2010 again. Oddly empowered by Cabrera's departure, San Francisco blew smoke in the face of the Dodgers new fancy owners and new fancy players, running away with the NL West, and, just for kicks, drove a stake into the heart of their rivals by <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=25295119&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_25295119&amp;v=3\">beating LA on Tuesday</a>, a loss which provided their fans with another Southern California season without playoff baseball. Now, up in Northern California, which, by the way, is the center of the baseball universe right now, the Giants are ready to try and avenge a sour 2011, and have a crack at winning a second title in three seasons, something many experts think is very possible. That's especially so with NL batting champion Buster Posey, who was out for most of last year after that traumatic incident at the plate, becoming a wild man in the second half, making the diamond his own, with an 1.110 OPS in the second half. And how about little Gregor Blanco, hitting .291 in September. Who needs Melky? Certainly not manager <a href=\"http://blog.sfgate.com/giants/2012/09/27/sf-giants-formally-announce-melky-cabrera-is-out-for-postseason/\">Bruce Bochy</a> who turned down the opportunity to have him back for the post season should they have gotten to the NLCS. He's serious when he says that the Giants have moved on, and if you don't believe him, check the record. San Francisco are 30-14 since Melky left the team, and are without question the hottest club in the playoffs. </p> <p>This is a different team to the 2010 champs, (which are similar to the 2012 Reds in some ways) one that can score runs easier, and one that has a harder time preventing them (see Tim Lincecum). The pitching is still good, but it doesn't resemble the dominant staff that guided the team to the title. Still, any team that has Matt Cain, who will start Game One of the NLDS vs. Cincinnati, Madison Bumgarner, and a resurgent Barry Zito who is making a bid for a playoff rotation spot, has enough pitching to win. Then there is the upside - Ryan Vogelsong, who has been poor for over a month, snaps out of his slump, while Tim Lincecum magically reappears. There is a lot of talent there, less in the bullpen, which are still without Brian Wilson of course. They face another pitching rich team in the Reds, one with an incredible bullpen. This is probably the best matchup of the playoffs. </p> <p><strong>Cincinnati Reds<br></strong><br>Cincinnati is a small city in Ohio close to the border of Kentucky. Of all the teams in the playoffs, the Reds may be the team that inspires the least amount of feeling from a national audience. Luckily for them, success in the playoffs isn't based on a straw poll of coastal baseball snobs, rather, it's based in talent, and the Reds have their best team since they upset the A's in the 1990 World Series. In fact, Cincinnati put up the second best record in baseball, just a single game behind the Nationals. </p> <p>First things first, Joey Votto. This man has an OPS of over 1.000 despite having hit just 14 home runs all season long. Granted, he missed over 50 games, but the staggering number here is 44 doubles - a lot of two-baggers in just 111 games. The Reds offense goes downhill from there, and it's really interesting just how much this team has transformed from a run scoring red machine in 2010, one that won the NL Central, to a club that has struggled to put runs on the board and now relies on its pitching. Back in 2010, their staff ERA was seventh in the NL, and the pitching rich Phillies were able to shut them down and score enough off their mediocre arms, sweeping the NLDS. I assure you, that no one will be sweeping the Reds this time around.</p> <p>The starting rotation led by Johnny Cueto has four pitcher's with ERAs under 4.00 - no easy task in their home run-happy ballpark. The five starters made every start except one, which is absolutely incredible. Even more shocking is the bullpen. Back in the spring when <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fespn.go.com%2Fmlb%2Fspring2012%2Fstory%2F_%2Fid%2F7731716%2Fcincinnati-reds-closer-ryan-madson-miss-season-elbow&amp;ei=5aFtUJ2bKuqM0wW1toGwCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNG8lLpWzD3Zd1eZEHBugsSEqcqGTA\">Ryan Madson</a> went down for the season, no one could have imagined that the Reds would have one of the most dominant relief cores in the game, but that's what they have with Aroldis Chapman, Sean Marshall, and Jonathan Broxton. Despite their lack of offense, the Reds are capable, as their record shows. However, one note of caution. They beat up on sub-.500 teams this season, with seven more wins than the next best team against lowly opponents. That begs the question, how will the Reds fare against a higher caliber opponent now that they're are in the playoffs?</p> <h2>Predictions:</h2> <p><strong>AL</strong></p> <p>Orioles defeat Rangers<br>Orioles defeat Yankees in five games<br>A's defeat Tigers in five games<br>A's defeat Orioles in seven games</p> <p><strong>NL</strong></p> <p>Cardinals defeat Braves<br>Cardinals defeat Nationals in five<br>Giants defeat Reds in five<br>Cardinals defeat Giants in seven</p> <p><strong>World Series</strong></p> <p>Cardinals defeat A's in seven</p> <p>Post yours below!</p>",

Early on, the president accused Romney of wanting to put in place a $5tn tax cut that will, he claimed, blow up the deficit and curtail spending.</p> <p><a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/presidential-debate-transcript-denver-colo-oct/story?id=17390260&amp;singlePage=true#.UG0SV_lXt8s\">Romney denied he has a plan</a> of such magnitude; that it would \"reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans\"; or that it would even widen the deficit. Why, you might ask? Because, according to Romney, he would \"lower deductions and exemptions and credits \u2026 so we keep getting the revenue we need.\" In other words, don't worry about all that lost revenue: I'm going to make some other changes to the tax code. It all sounded quite reasonable.</p> <p>The problem, however, is that it isn't plausible. A <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/03/debate-fact-check_n_1937831.html?utm_hp_ref=elections-2012\">20% across-the-board tax cut</a> <em>will</em> cut taxes for the wealthy and it almost certainly will increase the deficit, especially since Romney also wants to spend trillions more on defense and hasn't indicated any significant spending cuts that he supports.</p> <p>This is the deception lurking behind Romney's economic plan. In fact, <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/url.cfm?ID=1001628\">according to the Tax Policy Center</a>, it's mathematically impossible to close enough loopholes to make Romney's tax cut plan deficit neutral. Thus, the obvious rejoinder to Romney's assertions is to ask him point blank: \"OK, Governor Romney, what loopholes would you cut? What deductions would you remove from the tax code? Would you get rid of the mortgage interest deduction?\"</p> <p>Barack Obama, for some inexplicable reason, didn't ask those questions.</p> <p>Romney's lack of policy specifics is his most obvious glass jaw. On the one hand, if unchallenged, it gives Romney the opportunity to sound credible and sensible \u2013 everyone sounds more reasonable on the issue of tax cuts when they don't have to delve into details. On the other hand, it allows Obama to test Romney's credibility or fill in the blanks himself \u2013 as Obama tried to do by claiming that Romney's plan would likely result in higher middle-class taxes.</p> <p>Yet, Obama didn't take advantage \u2013 seeming, instead, content to play defense and avoid getting in the muck with Romney. While the media hysteria over Obama's lackluster performance is overstated, this strategy was a big political mistake. </p> <p>Reporters are desperate for the race to tighten and with expectations for Romney as low as can be imagined, even a passable performance was going to earn him hosannas. That Romney gave a rather strong performance and Obama was so passive, created the perfect opportunity for the press to tout the \"Romney resurgence\" meme and give him the big debate \"win\" that he needed.</p> <p>Considering the deep polarization of the electorate \u2013 and that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/04/mitt-romney-won-debate-win-election\">debates rarely change the trajectory of a race</a> \u2013 last night is likely not going to have a huge impact on the campaign. But this was a significant and unnecessary bump in the road.</p> <p>Being likable is all well and good, but sometimes, you have to go on the offensive. If your opponent throws you a fastball down the middle of the plate \u2013 as Romney did on his tax cutting plans \u2013 take a swing.</p> <p><em>Michael Cohen is a US columnist for the Observer and Guardian</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/cheri-jacobus\">Cheri Jacobus</a>: 'Barack Obama didn't want to be there'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397201290\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/3/1325610796868/cherijacobus_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Cheri Jacobus\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The body language told the story.<br>&#xa0;<br>Governor Romney spoke directly to President Obama, making it clear how his policies had failed these past four years, and gave a robust explanation of his vision and plans to create jobs and grow the economy. Obama couldn't look him in the eye. He looked down at his notes, knowing he was being taken to the woodshed, and rightfully so. There was no teleprompter to save him.</p> <p>President Obama acted as though someone else had been in the White House these past four years, and offered a scatter-brained professorial presentation of theory, with nothing to brag about from his presidency. Mitt Romney, meanwhile, hit all the right notes on Obamacare, while the president smirked and looked at his feet. </p> <p>Romney reminded America that Obamacare does, in fact, establish a board that will ultimately decide on treatment options. While Obama tried to convince us all that Obamacare was not a government takeover of healthcare, he was unconvincing \u2013 he didn't even seem to believe what he was saying.</p> <p>And kudos to Governor Romney for calling Obama out on passing the most massive piece of legislation in history without a single vote from the other party \u2013 something that no president had ever done. Even in the most partisan and rancorous of times in Washington, there was enough respect for the two-party system and voters to avoid such an arrogant and autocratic move. It is the chief reason voters threw out so many members of Congress from Obama's party in 2010 and put Republicans in charge of the House of Representatives.</p> <p>It's not an understatement to say Romney wiped the floor with Obama: even moderator Jim Lehrer was tougher than Obama was. Mitt Romney connected with voters. Barack Obama didn't want to be there.</p> <p>President Obama has a record now, and it's not one of hope and change. He knows it. And it showed.</p> <p>While many journalists were tweeting their boredom after it became apparent this was a blowout for Romney, there was one person who was even more eager than them for the debate to end. President Obama couldn't wait for the night to be over. </p> <p>I am looking forward to the debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan.</p> <p><em>Cheri Jacobus is a Republican consultant and strategist</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nancy-goldstein\">Nancy Goldstein</a>: 'Obama can't show up for 40 million viewers vibing like Eeyore'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397201291\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2011/6/8/1307540115667/nancygoldstein_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Nancy Goldstein\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Dear Obama Debate Prep Team,</p> <p>Sorry, dudes: you must feel like hell after last night. If the standard for comparison is \"Who best accomplished what he came to do?\", then this was clearly Romney's round.</p> <p>Sure, it was a lopsided fight. Romney has been looking and sounding like Vlad the Impaler for so long that all he had to do to exceed expectations was show up acting like someone who doesn't sleep in a crypt; strike a pose from the Ronald Reagan Compassionate Conservative playbook; spit out a few numbers; and seem puzzled by all of those, er, <em>rumors</em> about his plans to cut taxes for the rich and roll the rest of us back to serfdom.</p> <p>Some of Obama's gaffes can easily be fixed. Remind him to stand up straight and look directly into the camera. Get him more sleep, or cop some Adderall: the guy can't show up in front of 40 million viewers vibing like Eeyore.</p> <p>Revive Obama's ability to explain complex topics lucidly and, most importantly, fix his tone. It's all that dogs, students, and the average listener take away from most encounters \u2013 especially when confronted with a debate so teeth-grindingly filled with minutiae at the same time that it was so head-bangingly short on specifics.</p> <p>Romney sounded friendly and reasonable on the surface, where it counts most. Obama, by contrast, sounded petulant and tense, which is where he goes when he's feeling defensive, under-appreciated, or like the Smartest Guy in the Room, which is often \u2013 and never more so than when discussing the economy.</p> <p>I'm sure that the presidency is hell on a stick. But at a time of stagnant wages, rising costs, and high unemployment, Obama should expect to have to keep defending his policies. End of story. </p> <p>Now man up and get back into the game.</p> <p><em>Nancy Goldstein is a progressive writer and communications strategist </em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/michael-wissot\">Michael Wissot</a>: 'Voters are seeing a deficit in confidence from President Obama'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397201292\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/4/1325692835573/michaelwissot_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Wissot\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Mitt Romney's debate performance last night was nothing short of masterful. His readiness proved that a contentious primary is the best way to prime a nominee for the grandest stage.</p> <p>Romney has learned through each debate experience that every attack requires a direct response. Otherwise, perception quickly becomes reality.</p> <p>Barack Obama unleashed his offensive ammunition early \u2013 accusing Romney of pushing a $5tn tax cut, a $250,000 tax break for the wealthy, and a $2,000 tax hike for middle-class families. Some politicians make a mistake here by defending their plan. Romney, instead, made clear commitments against such accusations, essentially squashing the president's momentum. </p> <p>Romney needed to define himself on his own terms, and he did just that. He expressed shared goals with the president, but clearly differentiated his vision. He defended his principles with substance and conviction while maintaining a respectful tone.</p> <p>The opening topics \u2013 jobs, taxes and the federal deficit \u2013 all played to Romney's strengths. It allowed him to personalize the frustration and disappointment that Americans are feeling over the economy. It shifted the litmus test to the president's record. And it exposed President Obama's lack of focus and preparation for this match-up.</p> <p>Romney's unflappable gamesmanship will not go unnoticed, particularly among swing voters. He seized the high ground on bipartisanship, contrasting his success with Democrats in Massachusetts to the president's struggles with congressional Republicans.</p> <p>President Obama assumed a \"not to lose strategy\", but it reaffirmed his inherent weakness and disdain for debates, particularly as an incumbent. He almost appeared shocked that Romney would challenge him.</p> <p>Voters expected a much stronger performance from the president, whose arguments were circuitous and aimless. He resisted eye contact, looking down whenever Romney spoke to him. His delivery was choppy. And he appeared genuinely agitated whenever Romney refuted and redefined the president's claims. </p> <p>For the first time, voters are seeing a deficit in confidence from President Obama.</p> <p>Sometimes, the simplest of language, even pronouns, can be quite telling. When debating John McCain in 2008, President Obama excessively used \"we\" (instead of \"I\") as a rallying cry to join his crusade. Four years later, he used \"we\" to explain his record and decisions, almost removing any direct accountability. It revealed a lack of ownership over his presidency.</p> <p>The president's advisers face a dilemma: if they don't allow him to take ownership, they are stripping him of any confidence in himself or his presidency. Without that familiar confidence, President Obama may see his lead quickly dissipate.</p> <p><em>Michael Wissot is a senior strategist for Luntz Global </em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jim-geraghty\">Jim Geraghty</a>: 'This was Romney's most comfortable, natural performance of his candidacy'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397201293\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/11/1326298456752/jimgeraghty_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Geraghty\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Between his past performances in GOP primary debates and his considerable amount of time spent in debate prep, smart observers expected Mitt Romney to be at least pretty good Wednesday night. Instead, he hit it out of the park: his most comfortable, most exceptionally detailed, natural performance of his candidacy.</p> <p>Clearly, the early word that Romney would offer \"zingers\" was a misdirection, as he avoided most cutesy or canned lines. Instead, he focused on coming across as \"the man with the plan\".</p> <p>He began by saying he had a five-point jobs agenda. Lists of proposals are usually problematic for debaters, as they start describing the first few, get into the weeds, and run out of time for the last few. Romney managed to summarize his quintet of proposals in 115 words, less than a minute. It was a remarkably crisp, clear, direct opening argument, one that reached audiences before any started clicking away to other channels.</p> <p>Almost no one expected President Obama would be so listless, meandering, and off his game. I was left seriously wondering if Obama had gotten enough sleep the night before; perhaps the no-applause rule deprived him of the audience reaction that helps fuel his energy and confidence in stump speeches.</p> <p>Periodically President Obama talked about things he wanted to do \u2013 as if he wasn't the incumbent and hadn't had the opportunity to enact his proposals. Early on, he offered an anecdote of a teacher he met in Las Vegas with 42 kids in each class, not enough desks, and outdated textbooks. Many viewers probably wondered why Obama was telling us how bad things are right now, and why he hadn't done something about that school's problems.</p> <p>Shortly after Romney had laid out how tax increases would cost jobs, arguing \"there's nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes,\" Obama had his worst moment \u2013 turning to moderator Jim Lehrer and effectively surrendering:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Jim, you may want to move on to another topic.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>America, you may want to move on to another president.</p> <p><em>Jim Geraghty is a contributing editor to the National Review</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/heather-hurlburt\">Heather Hurlburt</a>: 'So what would Romney borrow money from China to pay for?'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397201294\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2011/10/11/1318360150849/heatherhurlburt_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Heather Hurlburt\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When Governor Romney turned to Jim Lehrer last night and pledged, \"I will eliminate programs by this test, if they don't pass it: is the program so critical that it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if not, I'll get rid of it,\" he seemed to be inviting another one of the moderator's philosophical questions.</p> <p>It hung in the air unasked, instead. In an interdependent global economy, what <em>is</em> worth borrowing money from a competitor and potential adversary for?</p> <p>Perhaps the answer is: anything I, my party, my political philosophy, wants, because money is fungible. Because the US economy is too big to fail. Because borrowing and the debt are part of how giant entities do business, and not as catastrophic as our national dialogue in recent months would suggest.</p> <p>Or perhaps the answer is: anything that will ultimately make our economy and society stronger to compete against and cooperate with China in growing the global economy and maintaining security. That test would offer some interesting moments.</p> <p>Borrowing money to invest in cheap, clean, high-tech energy sources, technology and infrastructure \u2013 which will, in turn, generate jobs and world-beating exports. Seems like a no-brainer.</p> <p>Borrowing money to invest in five-figure tax cuts for that 0.01% of wealthiest \"job-creators\"? Sure, if you believe in trickle-down economics. Certainly not, if you don't.</p> <p>Borrowing money to promote social cohesion? Well, do you believe we need social cohesion to be an effective, competitive society? Thinking about China, perhaps one of the world's cultures that places the highest value on social cohesion \u2013 and whose leaders are terrified at the prospect of social unrest \u2013 is instructive. And what promotes social cohesion? Keeping our promises to veterans by fully funding the veterans administration? Providing healthcare and dignity to seniors, the poor and&#xa0;vulnerable, for the sake of our shared humanity and also our collective public health?</p> <p>Borrowing money from China to increase the exponential edge our military,&#xa0;the world's largest, strongest military, has on the competition?&#xa0;Do you believe our military might is the foundation of all our power? Does it make us more economically competitive? Or do you believe, like the current and past chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff, that it works the other way around?</p> <p>What's more,&#xa0;is it worth borrowing money from China to pay for tanks that can't be used against China, and which the Pentagon doesn't want, anyway? Nuclear weapons that top security thinkers believe are obsolete?</p> <p>Just asking.</p> <p><em>Heather Hurlburt is executive director of the National Security Network</em></p>",

What are your opinions on the Sony S and E series (i5), and could you recommend one for me please?</em><br><strong>Esther</strong></p> <p>By far the largest proportion of the Windows laptop market is for economy-priced machines, which usually cost less than \u00a3500. However, most of the larger suppliers have at least one well constructed high-end design, and in private, may even refer to it as a \"hero product\". Today, this should have a third generation Intel Core iX chip, code-named Ivy Bridge, and it may well have a dedicated graphics chip, to supplement the Intel HD 4000 graphics probably built into the processor. Several of these systems also include built in 3G connections as well as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.</p> <p>The \"hero product\" will often have a 1600 x 900 screen display instead of the usual 1366 x 768 pixels. Opting for this on anything smaller than a 17in screen will eliminate the vast majority of Windows laptops and almost guarantees a better quality machine. It also means that text looks smaller. Look at this resolution in a shop: it is not to everyone's taste.</p> <p>At the moment, the Sony S Series 13P probably fills the hero niche (the P stands for Premium) previously occupied by the \"ultimate\" <a href=\"http://www.sony.co.uk/product/vaio-z-series\">Vaio Z</a>. By comparison, the <a href=\"http://www.sony.co.uk/product/vaio-e-series\">E Series</a> uses plastic construction and competes in the economy market (\"Stand-out style and everyday essentials for work and play,\" says Sony) at \u00a3400 to \u00a3500.</p> <p>The major difference between the Sony S Series 13 and the 13P is that the S has the base-level 13.3in widescreen with a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels. The 13P has a Premium Display with a resolution of 1600 x 900 pixels. </p> <p>The Sony S Series 13 is the one you are most likely to see in a shop. It is usually white, but is also available in black and silver versions for an extra \u00a320. The S Series 13P model comes in either carbon black or a gun-metal finish. Sony also sells a silver S Series 15 with a 15.5in Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixel) screen. All three are available from the <a href=\"http://www.sony.co.uk/customise/vaio-s-series\">Sony UK website</a>.</p> <p>The main advantage of buying direct is that you can configure your own laptop, with a choice of processor, memory, hard drive, optical drive, operating system and additional software. Also, you know you will get the latest version. Sony has been making S Series laptops for a few years and doesn't change the name when it updates the specification.</p> <p>The standard black S Series 13P (code SVS13A1C5E in the UK; SVS13A190X in the USA) starts at \u00a31,020. However, you can upgrade from a 2.5GHz Intel Core i5-3210M to a 2.9GHz Core i7-3520M for an extra \u00a350, and upgrade the slot-loading DVD player to Blu-ray for an extra \u00a340. These are bargain prices. Upgrading from 4GB of memory to 8GB costs \u00a3100, which isn't, but you could increase it to 6GB for \u00a350 or fit your own extra RAM.</p> <p>The 13P's Nvidia GeForce GT 640M LE graphics comes with 1GB of memory as standard, and upgrading to 2GB costs an extra \u00a330. This would be useful for handling graphics, including your Adobe software and any high-end games. But for most computing purposes, such as word processing and web browsing, the dedicated graphics will usually be turned off to save battery power.</p> <p>An upgraded 13P with a backlit keyboard, Core i7 processor, 6GB of main memory, 2GB of video memory, 500GB hard drive, Blu-ray, three USB ports and two-year warranty comes out at \u00a31,241.While this is expensive for a Windows laptop, it's the same as a 13.3in MacBook Pro with a similar spec (\u00a31,249). The MacBook Pro has a bigger hard drive (750GB), but the Sony 13P has dedicated graphics, and Apple doesn't offer you Blu-ray or 3G. Whether you need these is another matter.</p> <p>The Sony S Series 13P is a high-end ultraportable, and would typically compete with other ultraportable business laptops such as the Lenovo ThinkPad X range and Toshiba's Port\u00e9g\u00e9 machines. However, the market has shifted over the past couple of years, following the success of Apple's MacBook Air. Most PC companies now offer similar Windows laptops following Intel's Ultrabook specification. This requires, among other things, a thin body and fast start-up and resume times.</p> <p>The MacBook Air and Ultrabooks are today's fashion, but manufacturers make some sacrifices to create thinner laptops. These include dropping the optical drive (which ultraportable ThinkPads did last century), restricting the number of ports, sealing in the battery, and replacing the hard drive with Flash memory chips. These SSDs (solid state drives) provide much snappier performance, especially since you never have to wait for hard drive platters to spin up to speed. The disadvantages are that SSDs are expensive and tend to be rather small, eg 128GB or 256GB.</p> <p>Sony's Ultrabook is the <a href=\"http://www.sony.co.uk/product/vaio-t-series\">Vaio T Series</a>, which is similar to the S Series but better value. Prices start at \u00a3649 for the model with an 11.6in screen and \u00a3679 for the 13.3in version. Upgrading a T13 to a 1.7GHz Core i5-3317U processor, 8GB of memory and 128GB SSD will set you back \u00a3819. Compared with the 13P, you lose processor speed, the dedicated Nvidia graphics, keyboard backlighting and the DVD or Blu-ray drive, but gain in SSD speed and battery life. Weight is about the same.</p> <p>Several other Ultrabooks are also worth considering. The leading examples are the new Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon, Toshiba Port\u00e9g\u00e9 Z903, Samsung Series 9 and Asus Zenbook UX32A. All of these have the latest Intel Core i5-3317U (Ivy Bridge) processor or better.</p> <p>The ThinkPad X1 Carbon and Samsung Series 9 have the edge in showing 1600 x 900 pixels, whereas the Asus and Toshiba models only do the usual 1366 x 768. However, the X1 Carbon comes at a price, with the cheapest version costing <a href=\"http://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/e/gbweb/LenovoPortal/en_GB/catalog.workflow:category.details?current-catalog-id=FD6DB49790C7411D933567FC361231FB&amp;current-category-id=0597A13DC78024196A0F9053BA7842EE&amp;action=init\">\u00a31,039.99</a> if bought direct. The <a href=\"http://uk.computers.toshiba-europe.com/innovation/product/Portege-Z930-11G/1130783/toshibaShop/false/\">Toshiba Port\u00e9g\u00e9 Z930-11G</a> costs even more. By contrast, you could get a shiny Asus UX32A for <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B008FPLFJC/\">\u00a3695.92 at Amazon.co.uk</a>, reduced from \u00a3849.99, or a chic Samsung Series 9 (NP900X3C-A02UK) for <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-NP900X3C-Ultrabook-Integrated-Graphics/dp/B008EJGJKE/\">\u00a3922.09</a>, reduced from \u00a31,199. </p> <p>Asus also has a high-end Zenbook, the UX32VD, with a Full HD (1920 x 1080) screen, Nvidia GeForce GT 620M dedicated graphics and a somewhat better keyboard. This has not (as far as I know) been announced in the UK, so any you see will be imported. Either way, text will be rather small with so many pixels on screen, even with Windows 7's magnification set to 125%.</p> <p>After that, it's down to whether you like the screen and keyboard, what your main uses will be, and personal choice. If you will be carrying the machine around and stopping and starting it regularly, you would benefit from the longer battery life and fast resume times of an Ultrabook. If you will be using it more at home, or with heavyweight software, then you will benefit from the extra power and graphics of an ultraportable such as the Sony Series S 13P or Vaio Z. </p> <p>You might even want to step up from a 13.3in or 14in (X1 Carbon) screen to a 15.6in laptop, though this would mean carrying a bigger and heavier machine. If so, judging by reviews, a Samsung such as the Series 9 (900X4C) could be a better buy than the Sony S Series 15. </p> <p>In general, I like the Sony hardware, but the company has a reputation for loading its laptops with unwanted software. It's not always easy to remove programs you don't want, and it comes back if you need to re-set the laptop to factory condition using the recovery partition on the hard drive. </p> <p>Of course, Sony is not the only Windows supplier to do this to its consumer laptops. Business machines such as Lenovo ThinkPads, Toshiba Port\u00e9g\u00e9s and Dell Vostros usually ship with much less bloatware. They also tend to be designed for greater durability rather than the lowest price.</p> <p>When it comes to fashionability, the Sony and ThinkPad brands stand out from the general morass of Windows laptops, with the ThinkPad being <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/happy-20th-birthday-to-the-ibm-thinkpad-a-design-classic-7000002561/\">the leading business brand over the past 20 years</a>. But neither of these is quite at the pinnacles of yesteryear, following Sony's long-term financial problems and the sale of IBM's PC division (which developed the ThinkPad) to China's Lenovo in 2005.</p> <p>The companies that are increasing their brand value are South Korea's Samsung and Taiwan's Asus. These are becoming prestige brands in parts of Asia, though perhaps not yet in the west. The Sony S Series 13P and ThinkPad X1 Carbon have the most cachet, but the Samsung Series 9 and Asus Zenbook may be better value for money at discounted prices.</p>",
  "<p>The Labour leader Ed Miliband had fired the \"starting gun\" for the next general election after his widely acclaimed speech to the party's annual conference, his deputy Harriet Harman told delegates on Thursday.</p> <p>She also gave the first insight into the party's strategy, revealing that shadow cabinet ministers would pair with candidates in marginal seats to help them campaign.</p> <p>In the deputy leader's traditional closing conference speech in Manchester, Harman built on the apparent success of the week and in particular Miliband's keynote speech on Tuesday in which he spelt out his vision of \"one nation\" Labour and \"one nation\" Britain.</p> <p>Harman said Labour now had a \"fighting chance\" of ousting the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition in the 2015 election.</p> <p>In the campaign, shadow chancellor Ed Balls will be paired with Clair Hawkins in Dover and Deal in Kent; shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna with Clive Lewis and Jessica Asato in Norwich; and Harman herself with Andrew Pakes in Milton Keynes.</p> <p>\"To win the next general election we must \u2013 all of us \u2013 adopt a marginal seat mindset and listen to the people where we don't have Labour MPs as well as where we do,\" added Harman.</p> <p>\"We've got to be the voice speaking up for the young couple in Dartford, as well as the young couple in Darlington,\" she said, echoing the ubiquitous one nation theme. \"We've got to speak up for the pensioner in Gloucester, as well as Grimsby. The commuter in Milton Keynes as well as in Manchester.\"</p> <p>Harman also appeared to have sanction to break with the unwritten rule of the week: that Labour leaders focus on attacking Tories rather than Lib Dems, in case they need to form a coalition after 2015.</p> <p>Harman attacked the Lib Dems for undermining their own policy achievements, such as a higher income tax threshold and the pupil premium for children from disadvantaged backgrounds, by voting for policies to cut tax credits for the worst off and cut education spending overall.</p> <p>She also attacked the Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg in person, and even Vince Cable, widely see as Clegg's replacement if the coalition party does not recover in the polls in the next year.</p> <p>\"Safe Vince is in it up to his neck too,\" said Harman, reminding delegates that it was Cable who was in charge of the big increase in university tuition fees. \"I have a message for Vince: don't bother texting Ed, he's changed his number.\"</p> <p>The first polls since Miliband's speech, published on Thursday, showed the Labour leader and the party had gained a notable bounce. A YouGov state of the parties poll gave Labour a 14 point lead over the Conservatives, up six points since Wednesday, and the Daily Mirror reported an opinion poll showing the proportion of people who see Miliband as \"statesmanlike\" nearly doubled from 18% to 34%.</p>",
  "<p>After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/01/babar-ahmad-appeal-us-extradition?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">fighting a lengthy battle</a> lasting more than eight years, I expect to be extradited to the US imminently. Since my detention without charge began in August 2004, millions of pounds of British taxpayer's money has been spent on keeping me in a high-security prison all these years, on legal costs and parliamentary business. In addition, there have been at least 10 demonstrations attended by hundreds of people, several parliamentary debates and thousands of letters written to MPs, ministers and public officials. As if all this was not enough, last year nearly <a href=\"http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/885\" title=\"\">150,000 people signed an e-petition</a> to Downing Street calling for me to be put on trial in Britain.</p> <p>As well as tangible costs, the government has paid a price in outrage, disillusionment with legitimate forms of protest and resentment towards the justice system. This is not to mention the tens of thousands of pounds spent by my family (all British taxpayers) out of their own money supporting me, visiting me in prison and campaigning for me to be tried here in Britain, something they mistakenly thought their taxes had already paid for.</p> <p>So why has this battle been fought? Why should I be put on trial in Britain? Why have I spent all this time and effort fighting extradition (or \"avoiding extradition\" as some like to put it)? As a British citizen who has lived since birth in Britain, studied, worked full-time and paid taxes, if I am accused of any offence here in Britain I expect at the very least to face trial here in Britain.</p> <p>I am not against the concept of extradition; in fact I support it, but only for fugitives. If someone is accused of murder in Texas or robbery in New York, then flees to Britain as a fugitive, of course that person should be extradited to face trial in the land where he allegedly committed the crime. Ministers have frequently defended our extradition arrangements with the US by claiming that the US also extradites people, including its own citizens, to Britain, so it is mutually reciprocal. However, the question to ask is how many people has the US extradited to Britain who are accused of committing offences on American soil? The answer is none, because US authorities considering foreign extradition requests understand very well that extradition should be for fugitives, not resident alleged offenders.</p> <p>As well as not being anti-extradition, I am not anti-US either. The US is a sovereign nation with a justice system that it can run how it wants. If you disagree with US penal policies, or believe them to be harsh, the answer is simple as we say in prison, \"If you can't do the time, don't do the crime.\" As a British citizen living in Britain during the period of the allegations against me, is it unreasonable to assume that I would have considered myself subject to British law, not US law (or that of any other country)? Indeed, as the government's former terrorism watchdog <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/feb/23/hacking-extradition\" title=\"\">Lord Carlile said in the case of computer hacker Gary McKinnon</a>: \"There is no doubt that Mr McKinnon could be prosecuted in this country, given that the acts of unlawful access occurred within our jurisdiction (ie from his computer in north London) and that he has admitted the offences. The English legal system is perfectly positioned to deal with cases of this nature making McKinnon's extradition both unnecessary and disproportionate.\"</p> <p>After my initial arrest in December 2003 during which Metropolitan police officers inflicted at least 73 injuries on me, I would have thought that the police would give to the CPS any material found in my house with a view to considering prosecuting me in the UK. After six days in custody I was released without charge and I returned to my full-time job at Imperial College London. However, as has recently been uncovered in legal documents, the Metropolitan police only showed a fraction of the material seized in my house to the CPS, sending the rest straight to the US so that it could seek my extradition (which it did do eight months later). What is even more concerning is that, at the time the senior police officer in charge of my case decided to effectively \"outsource\" my case to the US, he himself was a suspect in the separate investigation into the police assault on me (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13704751\" title=\"\">though he was never charged</a>).</p> <p>The recent decision by the CPS not to prosecute me for reasons of insufficient evidence still does not answer the central question at the crux of the matter: why did the Metropolitan police not hand over to the CPS all of the material it seized from my house in December 2003? Extraditing me to the US will not bury this question under the carpet: it will only amplify the problem.</p> <p>In recent years, successive British governments have lined up to offer apologies, or compensation (or both) to victims of cover-ups and miscarriages of justice: Hillsborough, Bloody Sunday, former Guantanamo inmates\u2026 It is said that the only lesson we learn from history is that we do not learn from history. In years to come, will future generations look proudly at this period of British history, a period in which a British citizen was detained without charge for a record time of over eight years then extradited to a foreign land where he was not a fugitive from justice? They will ask: was the extradition of Babar Ahmad worth it?</p>",
  "<p>Syria's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/03/nato-pentagon-shelling-turkish-village\" title=\"\">lethal shelling of a Turkish town</a>, the latest and most serious of a string of cross-border incidents this year, has put the international community on the spot. How much longer can the US, Nato, the UN security council, the EU and major non-western actors such as Russia and China keep the expanding Syrian crisis at arm's length, variously denouncing and abetting the Assad regime, squabbling between themselves, but doing next to nothing?</p> <p>Predictions that the violence, which has so far taken an estimated 31,000 lives, would spread beyond Syria's borders are now coming true. This trend directly threatens international peace and security, as defined by the UN charter. Yet still the great powers sit on their hands. The fact Turkey has made serious miscalculations, initially underestimating Bashar al-Assad's staying power and the refugee exodus, raises fears that its leaders may make further misjudgments under pressure, leading to military escalation.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_90447.htm\" title=\"\">A Nato statement issued after Turkey was attacked on Wednesday</a> acknowledged Syria's internal problems have now become everybody's business. \"The Syrian regime's recent aggressive acts at Nato's south-eastern border \u2026 are a flagrant breach of international law and a clear and present danger to security,\" it said. But Assad might well dismiss such concerns as eyewash. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Nato's secretary general, has made plain the alliance has no intention of replicating last year's Libyan intervention. Nato defence ministers are due to meet in Brussels next week but at present, Syria is not on the agenda.</p> <p>Reactions to the Ak\u00e7akale shelling from the US, Britain and others were similarly strong \u2026 and meaningless. The US state department called the incident \"depraved\" while Britain's foreign secretary, William Hague, said it was \"outrageous\". But neither mentioned practical measures.</p> <p>Neither the US nor Britain has shown any appetite, for example, for creating safe havens along the Syria-Turkey border or the sort of no-fly zones imposed in Iraq in the 1990s, as backed by France and Turkey. And as the UN security council prepared to meet today, Russia, predictably obstructive, said it would not support a statement condemning the Assad regime because, in its view, Ak\u00e7akale was an \"accident\".</p> <p>On past form, Turkey's efforts to rally international support will have limited effect. Any help may be focused on Turkish self-defence, rather than on addressing the broader Syrian crisis. <a href=\"http://www.todayszaman.com/columnist-294166-nations-run out-of-ideas-on-syria-as-fsa-runs-out-of-ammunition.html\" title=\"\">Writing in Today's Zaman</a>, columnist Lale Kemal, noted:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Neither Turkish-US bilateral cooperation nor multilateral meetings taking place among various countries on ending the bloodshed in Syria \u2026 have produced any recipe to address the problem \u2026 As the fighting takes place near the Turkish border, nations are running out of ideas over what to do with Syria and the FSA [Free Syrian Army rebels] is running out of ammunition.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Turkey recently hosted a summit of intelligence chiefs from France, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the US, in the form of CIA director David Petraeus, Kemal said.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The summit reflected an attempt by Turkey not to be left alone in dealing with the Syrian crisis [and] improve intelligence sharing \u2026 and how to coordinate to improve the FSA's ability to fight \u2026 However, the summit did not yield any results.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>This was partly because the US did not want to arm the FSA, for fear weapons might fall into the hands of al-Qaida, while Turkey worried the same thing might happen with Kurdish separatist fighters.</p> <p>All the same, the do-nothing, hand-wringing favoured by Turkey's international allies may not be politically sustainable much longer as the Syrian crisis inexorably expands not just into Turkey but into Iraq, Lebanon and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, too. Turkey will not go it alone, despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/04/turkey-syria-threat-security-live#block-506d7823c0e3aacd18e2f6a9\" title=\"\">a parliamentary motion authorising cross-border operations</a>. But pressure for more direct, multilateral intervention, most probably via Nato, is growing among Arab states and in the US, where Barack Obama's hands-off stance is under fire from Republicans.</p> <p>Alon Ben-Meir of New York University's Center for Global Affairs argued in a recent Turkish press interview that direct action was becoming both unavoidable and desirable, and that the best way forward was a no-fly zone. <a href=\"http://www.todayszaman.com/news-294214-syria-no-fly-zone-should-be-imposed-as-soon-as-possible.html\" title=\"\">He said</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Now that Turkey is asking for this, if Nato goes along with it and the United States goes along with it, that's a change in attitude. Turkey did not have the legal legitimacy to intervene. But now they also realise that everybody is intervening.<br>\"Iran is intervening by sending military advisors. Russia is intervening by sending weapons on a regular basis. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are intervening by sending money and some weapons. And the United States is intervening by sending communications gear and some weapons and money indirectly. So everyone is interfering, but they talk about no interference, which is cynical \u2026\"<br>\"The Assad regime is finished. When it might happen depends on what other powers do and when they do it. If after the [US presidential] election the United States along with Turkey, in particular these two countries, decide that the time has come, then they will be able to accelerate his demise.\"</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>Now that creating triple-A games requires similar levels of investment to making movies, we should all be grateful Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network offer an outlet for maverick developers with big ideas but little resources.</p> <p>And developers don't come more maverick than Arkedo, a bunch of wacky Frenchmen whose Paris studio, so they say, includes a pop-up restaurant. Arkedo's latest opus, Hell Yeah!

Primary and fluorescent colours abound and the setting \u2013 hell \u2013 supports all manner of surreal touches, such as a health-replenishing monster sporting 20-foot-long legs and an eyeball for a head reminiscent of The Residents.

Ash is equipped with a jet-pack which is also a drill, as well as an arsenal of over-the-top machine-guns, rockets, lasers which steadily grows as the game progresses.

  "<h2>1. Ed Miliband is a nimble, inventive politician whose 'one nation Labour' rebrand could up-end British politics </h2> <p>The most successful leaders are those who can shape events, and not just react to them, and now Miliband can claim to be playing in this league. At last year's conference he was leading a party for public sector workers and northerners. Now, following his one nation makeover, he's given Labour the ability to campaign on the appealing \"we're all in it together\" agenda that sustained David Cameron's Conservatism from December 2005 until March 2012. At the moment, \"one nation\" Labour is just rhetoric and marketing, but much of opposition is just rhetoric and marketing and, rather brilliantly, it combines a move to the centre with Miliband leftism. (In policy terms, at the moment one nation Labour largely seems to be new Labour plus higher taxes for the rich.) The polls have not moved dramatically yet but this rebrand could turn out to be transformative.</p> <h2>2. Miliband has postponed the difficult decisions about spending cuts or tax increases that would need to be taken by a Labour government</h2> <p>In his speech, he talked about \"tough settlements for the public services\", but he did not elaborate and he has said nothing all week that would alarm his activist base. This may be perfectly sensible at this stage in the electoral cycle. But the contrast with Labour's Scottish leader,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/oct/02/ed-miliband-speech-labour-conference-live#block-506abb3658f99afdfd4eb3bf\" title=\"\"> Johann Lamont, who is trying to make a virtue of her willingness to talk openly about potential cuts</a>, is striking, and Miliband will be vulnerable to Tory claims that he is either unwilling to balance the books or has got a secret agenda for tax rises or spending cuts.</p> <h2>3. The trade unions are comfortable with Miliband's leadership</h2> <p>There were the usual rows, of course, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/30/edmiliband-labour-conference-2012#block-15\" title=\"\">on Sunday</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/oct/01/ed-balls-labour-conference-live-blog#block-5069c0f058f99afdfd4eb389\" title=\"\">on Monday</a>, but this year it felt like tag wrestling: a contest staged as a spectator event, with no harm intended on either side. The unions have complained about Labour's willingness to endorse pay restraint in the public sector, but their complaints never crystallised around particular issues, Miliband did not say anything to upset them (see 2) and he even disclosed that he was going to the TUC demo.</p> <h2>4. Miliband is championing regulation as a new approach to redistribution </h2> <p>Although Labour is accused of not having any policies, that is not true. This week it announced plans to cap the fees charged by pension funds and to replace Ofgem with a tough regulator that would force firms to pass on price cuts in the wholesale energy market. This is redistribution, from corporate Britain to consumer Britain, a \"cap and regulate\" alternative to \"tax and spend\" (although it is quite possible that a Miliband government would give us \"tax and spend\" too \u2013 see 2).</p> <h2>5. Labour does not have a distinctive retail offer for the voters </h2> <p>The party does have policies, but no memorable, signature policy \u2013 equivalent to the Lib Dems' mansion tax or tax allowance rise \u2013 that can be used to sell the party on the doorstep.</p> <h2>6. Labour has embraced patriotism </h2> <p>The union flag has been everywhere this conference, there have been more references to the spirit of 1945 than at a British Legion reunion and the party is developing the concept of \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/oct/02/ed-miliband-speech-labour-conference-live#block-506abed058f99afdfd4eb3c5\" title=\"\">progressive nationalism</a>\". This is the one sign of the fact that Blue Labour, which was dismissed as a passing fad a few months ago, <a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2012/10/one-nation-labour-its-blue-labour-2-0/\" title=\"\">now seems to be very central to the Miliband project</a>.</p> <h2>7. Labour is discovering localism </h2> <p>In the era of New Labour and then Gordon Brown, the party was notoriously centralist. But now it seems to be coming around to the idea that it might be sensible for Whitehall to let go a bit. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/oct/03/ed-miliband-q-a-labour-conference-live#block-506c67c558f93d3343753fb2\" title=\"\">Miliband has said he wants to give more powers to English local government</a>, Lamont in Scotland has expressed support for localism and even the Fabians (traditionally the guardians of the democratic collectivist tradition) have published <a href=\"http://www.fabians.org.uk/publications/letting-go/\" title=\"\">a paper called Letting Go</a>, which is attracting some interest in Labour circles. The command and control tradition is still strong (and will remain so while Ed Balls is around), but a shift is taking place.</p> <h2>8. Labour is also becoming an activist opposition </h2> <p>Opposition parties cannot make law. But they can affect social change and this week, with Liam Byrne launching a youth employment taskforce, Labour councils adopting the living wage, Caroline Flint launching SwitchTogether, a scheme to get communities to negotiate lower energy bills, and Jim Murphy getting employers to help former soldiers find jobs, the party is making an effort to show it can make a difference.</p> <h2>9. The internal culture of the party is changing</h2> <p>Iain McNicol, the well-regarded general secretary, told the conference the party needed to change the way it campaigns \"more profoundly than we have for a generation\" and there is some evidence that this is happening. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jun/15/obamas-mentor-teaching-ed-walk\" title=\"Series: Inside Politics Previous | Next | Index Obama's mentor is teaching Ed to walk\">Arnie Graf</a>, the American community organiser who trained Barack Obama, is working with the party and activists are being encouraged to concentrate on local community campaigning, not just traditional party politics.</p> <h2>10. Fixed-term parliaments have made party conferences a bit more boring </h2> <p>Without the fixed-term parliament legislation, we would be expecting an election in spring 2014, or possibly earlier, and Labour this week would have been a bit panicky. But with no election until May 2015, there is less need to worry. The party does not need have to have a manifesto ready to go. Last week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/26/nick-clegg-lib-dem-conference-live#block-5062ba1cc0e327c3f7c905c1\" title=\"\">when I wrote a post about why party conferences seem more dull than they used to be, I missed this point</a>. But MPs have been talking about it at Manchester, and they are right.</p>",

  "<p>This is ostensibly a story about cycling in London but the message is relevant to all, so bear with me. The lesson is this: for all the talk of a cycling boom in the UK, cyclists largely remain a marginalised, fringe group who regularly face unchallenged slurs, falsehoods and generalisations. </p> <p>It all began in May when London's mayor, Boris Johnson, one of the more famous cyclists in the country, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/bike-blog/2012/may/25/cycling-governed-dimwits\">produced the startling statistic that in 62% of accidents in the capital</a> where a cyclist was killed or serious injured this was found to be down to the rider breaking the law. It was questioned by cycling groups and it turned out Johnson was repeating some hearsay he'd been told at a public meeting.</p> <p>That was alarming enough, but Johnson is infamously light on detail and lazy at mastering briefs, so it wasn't perhaps the greatest surprise. To me, what followed was even worse.</p> <p>I (and many others) asked the mayor's office when they planned to rescind the clearly false statistic. Again and again I got the same reply: <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/\">Transport for London</a>, the quango which runs transport policy for the mayor, was \"looking into\" the statistic. Eventually I gave up.</p> <p>Luckily, <a href=\"http://www.greenparty.org.uk/people/jenny-jones.html\">Green London Assembly member Jenny Jones</a> is made of sterner stuff, and she submitted a written question which, last last month, <a href=\"http://lcc.org.uk/articles/boris-johnson-retracts-claim-that-two-thirds-of-cyclists-killed-and-injured-broke-the-law\">finally got a reply</a>. Here's Johnson's statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I asked Transport for London to look into a statistic that I was told about during my election campaign. Its own statistics and research suggest this is not the case in London and I am pleased to be able to set the record straight on this.</p> </blockquote> <p>No apology, you'll note. Also, crucially, no mention of how wrong Johnson was. I asked TfL what their answer was. Astonishingly, <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/corporate/pedal-cyclist-collisions-and-casualities-in-greater-london-sep-2011.pdf\">their figures show</a> that in accidents were a cyclist was killed or badly hurt the cyclist was presumed to have committed an offence in just 6% of cases. The vehicle driver was assumed to have done so 56% of the time while 39% of the time it wasn't clear. This information was passed to Johnson before the Olympics, TfL said.</p> <p>What can we learn from this? Firstly, that Johnson was very, very wrong. Far from cyclists being to blame almost two-thirds of the time, they're actually almost a tenth as likely as drivers to have committed an offence. Secondly \u2013 and I'd say this is more significant \u2013 Johnson sees cyclists as so unimportant that he can not just trot out an obvious falsehood about cyclists but not bother to correct it for four months, even when his slur was proven.</p> <p>There's a lot of talk in the US about \"post-truth\" politics, where people like Republican vice presidential candidate <a href=\"http://news.runnersworld.com/2012/08/31/paul-ryan-says-hes-run-sub-300-marathon/\">Paul Ryan can tell demonstrable lies</a> without apparent damage to his reputation. Johnson is perhaps our most brazen, American-style politician, so again maybe it's not so shocking to see him doing the same. But the question is: would he have dared do the same to another group?</p> <p>Last month's issue of magazine The Psychologist <a href=\"http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_25-editionID_217-ArticleID_2136-getfile_getPDF/thepsychologist%5C0912walk.pdf\">carries a fascinating interview with Dr Ian Walker</a>, the man who famously <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/5334208.stm\">showed that drivers tend to give less room when overtaking to cyclists wearing helmets</a> (and gamely donned a blonde wig to see whether women get more space than me: apparently so). He describes how cyclists are treated as a classic societal \"outgroup\", meaning they suffer from \"overgeneralisation of negative behaviour and attributes\", for example, \"You all jump red lights\".</p> <p>Walker remains puzzled:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>However, there has to be more to it than just this. For a long time I wondered if the outgroup status of cyclists was compounded by two other known social psychological factors: norms and majority vs minority groups. Not only are cyclists an outgroup, they're also a minority outgroup. Moreover, they are engaging in an activity that is deemed slightly inappropriate in a culture that views driving as normative and desirable and, arguably, views cycling as anti-conventional and possibly even infantile. </p> <p>But even adding these factors into the mix does not explain all the anger that cyclists experience. It's easy to identify other minority outgroups whose behaviour similarly challenges social norms but who do not get verbally and physically attacked like cyclists do: vegetarians, for example. So there's clearly one or more important variables that we've not identified yet. Any social psychologists looking for a challenge are very welcome to wade into this.</p> </blockquote> <p>I thought of Walker's words as a listened to a discussion last week on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006wr3p\">Jeremy Vine's Radio 2 programme</a>. His type of show, where everyone is obliged to have a \"view\", ideally less than nuanced, might not be everyone's cup of tea but it's by no means the worst example of the sort.</p> <p>This segment was discussing cycling, and one of the guests was a journalist-turned comedy writer called Jan Etherington, who had written a particularly absurd cycling-baiting column for that day's Daily Telegraph. You can <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9562836/Wed-just-grown-to-love-cyclists-and-then-Andrew-Mitchell-had-to-come-along.html\">read it here</a>, if you have the strength. Suffice to say it was a half-baked \"humorous\" piece about how <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/24/andrew-mitchell-police-log\">Andrew Mitchell being short tempered on a bike</a> had ruined her Olympic-tinged love of cyclists, and she now saw us all as, yes, Lycra louts. Such nonsense was repeated more or less verbatim on Vine's show.</p> <p>I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/peterwalker99/status/250945024957759488\">tweeted my views</a> on the exchange, and to my surprise <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theJeremyVine/status/250984282632355840\">got a reply</a> from Vine. His argument, in a pair of 140-character missives, stressed that he was a cyclist and seemed to say Etherington was simply being given enough rope to hang her own argument.</p> <p>Vine said she complained that cyclists \"are using the road\" where she lives and \"wearing terrible outfits.\"</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-in-reply-to=\"250948773596000256\"> <p>@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/peterwalker99\">peterwalker99</a> ...and \"wearing terrible outfits.\" Better for her to say it than for me to stop her.</p> <p>\u2014 Jeremy Vine (@theJeremyVine) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theJeremyVine/status/250984282632355840\" data-datetime=\"2012-09-26T15:44:50+00:00\">September 26, 2012</a></p> </blockquote> <p>I wasn't convinced. I can almost live with the slurs, it's the lazy generalisations about cyclists that get me. Walker's comparisons with vegetarians is quite apt: both groups are hugely heterogenous collections of people with just one, slightly arbitrary, thing in common. When Harriet Harman was <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/anger-as-harriet-harman-escapes-driving-ban-for-mobile-phone-crash-6735983.html\">caught talking on her a mobile phone in a car</a> \u2013 a <a href=\"http://www2.potsdam.edu/hansondj/DrivingIssues/1059144296.html\">practice which most likely</a> costs more lives in a year than bad cycling would in a decade \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1217974/Im-Harriet-Harman--know--What-Minister-allegedly-told-witness-crashing-parked-car.html\">before telling police</a>, \"'I'm Harriet Harman - you know where you can get hold of me,\" there was a notable lack of Radio 2 discussions about how this showed \"drivers\" to be reckless and pompous.</p> <p>But when it comes to lazy generalisations, not to mention outright falsehoods, cyclists remain fair game. I find it very depressing.</p>",

Payback was one of the better ones, and now it's got a sequel. The model remains driving round a large world shooting people, completing missions and picking up new weapons along the way. Online multiplayer is also included.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.halfbrick.jetpackjoyride\">Jetpack Joyride</a></h2> <p>Having received enormous critical acclaim on iOS, Halfbrick Studios' Jetpack Joyride has flown onto Android, where it's proving just as popular.

Stunt Star is great fun, with its emphasis on physics, power-ups and lots of crashes.

Microsoft. The title sounds like it should be a banned DVD, but it's actually about a black tentacled creature called Lemmy (er...) who's trying to escape from a mad scientist's body through a \"top-down platformer\". Quirky, but very interesting.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamevil.restaurant.glo\">Restaurant Star</a></h2> <p>A social game based on running a restaurant? WHY HAS NO ONE THOUGHT OF THIS BEFORE?! Oh. But enough flippancy, because Restaurant Star looks like a polished take on the social cook 'em up genre, with different cuisines to master, and friends to out-serve.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/zaxxon-escape/id559568792?mt=8\">Zaxxon Escape</a></h2> <p>My, Zaxxon is looking different. When the original arcade game launched in 1982, it was a space-shooting racer with isometric graphics. Now it's been turned into a fully into-the-screen 3D title for iOS, as you try to escape an asteroid city by swiping and tapping. It also adopts another modern gameplay feature: in-app purchases. <strong>Update:</strong> after this piece was published, the game was also <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sega.zaxxonescape\">released for Android</a>.<br><strong>Android / iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://en.ratrodstudio.com/games/driftmania2/\">Drift Mania Championship 2</a></h2> <p>10m people have apparently played the first Drift Mania Championship game, making a sequel an inevitability.

It's the second iOS game from developer Mistwalker Corporation, founded by Hironobu Sakaguchi \u2013&nbsp;whose CV includes inventing a little-known RPG series by the name of Final Fantasy.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hotheadgames.google.free.bigwinfootball\">Big Win Football</a></h2> <p>That's football as in the American variety: endzones, touchdowns, comedy replacement referees and so on. Well, possibly not the last one in this case. Big Win Football is a card-based game where you build your team and its special moves from packs of virtual cards.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/roller-casino/id540668577?mt=8\">Roller Casino</a></h2> <p>Apple's decision to allow real-money gambling on iOS is spawning some interesting new titles. Roller Casino is the work of gambling firm Paddy Power, made for iOS rather than converted from an existing web game.

  "<p>Outside of comic books, no medium loves a recurring character quite so much as video games. The goal for any console developer these days isn't to make one great game \u2013 it's to construct the foundations of a franchise, a starting point for sequels and spin-offs. Capcom has been at this longer than most and, 15 years after the Arklay Mansion incident, the biggest project in the company's history is Resident Evil 6.</p> <p>Sounds like a straight-to-DVD nasty, doesn't it? Resi 6 is more like one of those box sets yoking together Con Air and Die Hard, promising the purchaser several evenings' worth of extras getting tipped over balconies. Resi 6 is obsessed with delivering a \"cinematic\" action experience, its levels punctuated by regular set-pieces, constant explosions, sharply-edited camera changes and a never-ending supply of near-death experiences. The directorial eye is a big part of Resident Evil's heritage, but here the focus has overwhelmingly shifted: \"survival horror\" is now \"constant action\".</p> <p>In some ways that's a bad thing: Resident Evil isn't scary any more. It'll give you a few shocks, enemies jumping out of hidden places and big monsters bursting through the floorboards, but the days of creeping through darkened rooms with bottom clenched are over. Resi 6 is what you call a run-and-gunner, moving ever-forwards while blasting through crowds of biohazards. Resident Evil 5 leaned in this direction, but Resi 6 dives in with both guns blazing.</p> <p>The real surprise is how much of it there is. Capcom's focus on the production values of Resi 6 makes a casualty of progress \u2013 in the context of the third-person shooter genre, the controls are clunkier than they should be, and you'd be hard pressed to call any of its new systems innovative. So the compensation is a quadruple helping of lengthy single-player campaigns, three of which are playable in co-op.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397169059\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2012/10/4/1349350191133/Resident-Evil-6-Ada-Wong-008.jpg\" alt=\"Resident Evil 6: Ada Wong\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Resident Evil 6: Ada Wong returns</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Heroes return, of course. Leon S Kennedy, last seen in Resident Evil 4, is joined for the first campaign by US agent Helena Harper, and this slice of Resi 6 is supposed to be delivering the horror. We know it doesn't quite manage that, but the most atmospheric environments in Resi 6 are found here \u2013 an early journey through a zombie-filled subway tunnel, complete with running trains, showcases the game's exquisite lighting tech like nothing else.</p> <p>Things escalate. By the end of Leon's campaign you'll have fought on top of trains, piloted a helicopter, wrestled a shark, had a shootout atop a skyscraper, ridden a mine cart and more or less surfed a jet; I'm pretty sure I saw a kitchen sink exploding at one point. These events are all over the place, really, some breathlessly exciting and others falling flat \u2013 the latter mainly thanks to an over-fiddly implementation of \"Simon says\" button-pressing, which isn't a fun thing to be doing in the first place.</p> <p>The other two campaigns star Chris Redfield, AKA Stubble Straightjaw, and Jake Muller, AKA White Rapper, and follow a pretty similar pattern \u2013 move forwards, fight a group of enemies, big set-piece, rinse and repeat. One of Resi 6's unqualified triumphs is that its shooting feels great, the meatier guns packing heavy recoil and each shot accompanied by a bellowing audio crack. It also doesn't hurt that the common enemies, whether zombies or the humanoid J-Avo, are often sent backflipping by the sheer force of your weapons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397169061\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2012/10/4/1349350088437/Resident-Evil-6-Chris-008.jpg\" alt=\"Resident Evil 6: Chris\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Resident Evil 6: Chris in the jaws of trouble</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is what saves Resi 6. Its cinematic sequences take control away from the player to a large extent, and then veer between brilliant and plain silly. But the bulk of the game is a combat system we've known since Resi 4, tweaked and tuned to be a tad more manoeuvrable, and then playable in co-op. Co-op makes everything better, that's just a truth, and Resi 6 is designed to be played with a buddy throughout (though the ally AI has improved vastly since Resi 5's item-quaffing Sheva).</p> <p>Each of the four campaigns took between five and seven hours to complete, plus on top of this there's the Mercenaries mode. This bonus mode is probably the best in gaming's history. Introduced in Resi 4, Mercs puts you in an enclosed arena, with a timer, sends in the enemies and doesn't stop \u2013 chaining kills gets combos, the enemies get more deadly as time goes on, and hitting big scores unlocks more gear for future missions. Freed of narrative restrictions and the need to move onwards, Resi's combat is left to fend for itself in a corner \u2013 and does it ever. Resi 6's take on Mercs is spiced up a little by the inclusion of assignable skills, but fundamentally it's a familiar, fantastic beast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397169062\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2012/10/4/1349349894603/Resident-Evil-6-Jake-008.jpg\" alt=\"Resident Evil 6: Jake\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Resident Evil 6: Jake in the heat of battle</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In that sense, Mercs is Resi 6 writ large: a game built on old foundations. It's not a progressive title at all, but then it isn't intended to be. Capcom's intentions are simple: to move Resi into the mainstream action zone, and give players as much bang as possible for their buck. It is an unsophisticated experience. If you want to be terrified, or use your brain, Resi 6 isn't the game. But if you just want to spray monster brains all over the place, while occasionally cooing at some gorgeous scenery, Resi 6 delivers in several spades.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Game reviewed on PS3</strong></p>",
  "<p>How many children are abducted in England and Wales? The possible abduction of April Jones has pushed the issue onto the front pages, but how common is it?</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-265883\">latest crime figures</a>, published by the Office for National Statistics, show 532 cases of child abduction reported to police in 2011/12.

If you exclude sexual offences, it shows that child abductions were 8% of those offences, so, small compared to child cruelty or neglect, which accounted for 6,081 crimes.

  "<p>Imports of ash trees could be banned to save the UK's estimated 80m of the species from a deadly fungus.</p> <p>The tree disease <em>Chalara fraxinea</em> has already decimated around 90% of Denmark's ash population and was found in the UK at a Buckinghamshire nursery in February, raising fears of a repeat of the epidemic of Dutch elm disease in the 1970s, which wiped out virtually the entire mature population of elm trees \u2013 25m \u2013 by the 1990s.</p> <p>Infected trees have since been found at a handful of locations in the UK from outside Glasgow to Cambridgeshire \u2013 though not in wild areas outside recent plantings and nurseries \u2013 and are being destroyed as they are found. Ash accounts for around a third of our wooded landscape which includes parks and hedgerows, as well as woods and forests.</p> <p>A ban on imports could come into effect as early as November, just before the planting season, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said on Thursday, <a href=\"http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/plants/consultations/index.cfm\" title=\"\">launching a consultation that ends on 26 October</a>.</p> <p>The environment secretary, Owen Paterson, said: \"This disease could have a devastating impact on our native ash trees so we need to take action to stop it. We are working towards a ban on imports, and looking to impose movement restrictions on trees from infected areas.\"</p> <p>He continued: \"By taking decisive action we can prevent our ash trees from suffering the same fate as elm trees did in the 1970s.\"</p> <p>Conservationists welcomed the move towards a ban on imports, saying it was \"not a minute too soon\". Norman Starks, UK operations director at the <a href=\"http://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/en/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Woodland Trust</a>, said: \"The Trust will no longer plant imported ash trees on our estate and is reducing the number of ash to be planted this season by 100,000 trees. We are committed to working with the industry to do everything possible to prevent the further spread of ash dieback and protect one of the nation's most common native trees.\"</p> <p>Dr John Morgan, head of the Forestry Commission's Plant Health Service, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2012/sep/26/fungus-kill-third-britains-trees\" title=\"\">told the Guardian last month</a> that the \"only reliable control is banning imports.\" In August, the trade body for the gardening industry, the Horticultural Trades Association, <a href=\"http://www.the-hta.org.uk/page.php?pageid=977\" title=\"\">called on its members to undertake a voluntary ban on ash imports</a>.</p> <p>The disease, which is widespread on the continent, causes leaf loss and dieback of the tree's crown, and can kill ash trees. The Buckinghamshire nursery where the disease was first found in the UK had imported 2,000 ash trees from the Netherlands and sent them on to 90 different customers around the country. Around 5m ash trees have been imported to the UK since 2003.</p> <p>Members of the public are being encouraged to report suspected cases to the Forestry Commission.</p>",
  "<p>Dystopia. Apocalypse. Death and destruction. There are two problems when you set out to write a book in this vein. The first is that you find yourself very limited as to what you can actually describe. After all, there are so many ways that the world can end \u2013 war, disease, alien invasion, zombification etc. And whatever the cause, the end result is going to be pretty much the same: mass starvation, anarchy, long-term suffering and slow death. Unless you're writing a screwball comedy (and there have been attempts), there's hardly going to be much variation in the mood of the book either.</p> <p>But for the writer, it's the second problem that is more intractable. The ground has been well covered. There are several masterpieces of apocalyptic fiction that have been produced over the last 100 years \u2013 indeed, over the last few thousand if you want to go all the way back to <a href=\"http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/mesopotamian/gilgamesh/\" title=\"\">The Epic of Gilgamesh</a>. How can you possibly escape their shadow?</p> <p>I didn't. When I wrote <a href=\"http://www.anthonyhorowitz.com/\" title=\"\">Oblivion</a>, the conclusion to <a href=\"http://www.anthonyhorowitz.com/poweroffive/\" title=\"\">my Power of Five series</a>, I was thinking of several writers who had gone before me; what follows, my favourite dystopias, could be seen as a confessional. I did my best not to steal outright. But all writing is a form of assimilation. How can any writer not be influenced by what he or she has read before? This is what influenced me.</p> <h2>1. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780330513005/the-road\" title=\"\">The Road</a> by Cormac McCarthy</h2> <p>Published in 2006, this is the apotheosis of apocalyptic fiction, rightly appearing near the top of every list. It's a grim read, made perhaps grimmer by how little it tells you about the world it describes. The two protagonists, a father and a son, have no names. We never find out exactly what happened to reduce the world to ashes. They carry a gun and two bullets \u2026 to use on themselves if they're taken by cannibals. The writing is pared down and poetic. \"Ash moving over the road and the sagging hands of blind wire strung from the blackened lightpoles whining thinly in the wind.\" It's a short, searing, unforgettable book.</p> <h2>2. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/science-fiction/9780141033006/the-day-of-the-triffids\" title=\"\">The Day of the Triffids</a> by John Wyndham</h2> <p>I don't suppose children read this in school any more but when I was growing up it was pretty much mandatory. The end of the world is ushered in by a meteor display that blinds everyone who sees it. The hero wakes up in hospital. His eyes were bandaged and so he retains his sight (the same opening must surely have inspired <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/93470/28.days.later\" title=\"\">28 Days Later</a>, Danny Boyle's excellent zombie film which begins in much the same way). Poisonous walking plants, triffids, then prey on the survivors. I will never forget the description of a blind man staggering out of a ransacked supermarket with what he thinks is a tub of food. In fact it is a pot of paint.</p> <h2>3. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/thrillers/9780099530251/on-the-beach\" title=\"\">On the Beach</a> by Nevil Shute</h2> <p>Another standby from my schooldays; it was written in 1957 and I think just about every young person of the time read it. It starts with a nuclear war between Albania and Italy (which seems rather unlikely in retrospect). The whole of the northern hemisphere has been destroyed and a cloud of poison and radiation is moving towards Melbourne, where the book is set. It doesn't end happily. Pretty much everyone accepts their fate and most of them commit suicide.</p> <h2>4. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/horror/9781444720730/the-stand\" title=\"\">The Stand</a> by Stephen King</h2> <p>In my view, King did much of his best work early in his career, and this supernatural thriller from 1978 is simply outstanding, particularly the opening section and the description of the manmade flu epidemic known as \"Captain Trips\", which sweeps across the world. King chooses his horrors with cold-blooded precision \u2026 the sequence that has one of the characters, Lloyd Henreid, dying of thirst and starvation locked up in a county jail is particularly vivid. The end of the book is a touch too biblical for my taste but it's still an amazing journey.</p> <h2>5. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780141318011/how-i-live-now\" title=\"\">How I Live Now</a> by Meg Rosoff</h2> <p>A book for children \u2013 but far more than a children's book. It won both the Guardian and the Whitbread children's fiction awards, and will soon be even better known as <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1894476/news\" title=\"\">it's just been filmed by Kevin Macdonald</a>. The book takes place in the English countryside during the third world war, and centres on a love story between two cousins, Daisy and Edmond, with an unforgettable, bitter-sweet ending. I loved it both for its verisimilitude \u2013 the food shortages, the terror of everyday life \u2013 and for the fact that (like The Road) it simply presents its world without trying to explain it.</p> <h2>6. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780140094190/when-the-wind-blows\" title=\"\">When the Wind Blows</a> by Raymond Briggs</h2> <p>Also, very tentatively, for children, this graphic novel came out in 1982 and featured two stalwart, working-class characters \u2013 Jim and Hilda Bloggs \u2013 who had already featured in Brigg's rather more cheerful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/comics/9780224085243/gentleman-jim\" title=\"\">Gentleman Jim</a>. The plot is simple. Jim and Hilda make it to a nuclear shelter just before the UK is bombed. However they have been exposed to radiation and despite their constant optimism and their fondness for each other, they slowly die. It's a brilliant exercise in pathos. What happens to the rest of the UK? We never find out.</p> <h2>7. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/science-fiction/9780330514019/childhoods-end\" title=\"\">Childhood's End</a> by Arthur C Clarke</h2> <p>This is the book that Stanley Kubrick decided not to make into a film. He did <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/\" title=\"\">2001: A Space Odyssey</a> instead. I'm not a huge fan of science fiction but this is an extraordinary novel that starts with the arrival of aliens who, it turns out, exactly resemble the devil. In fact, they're not evil (an early, outstanding sequence has them causing a crowd at a bullfight to share the pain of the bull), but it turns out that they have come to witness the end of the world \u2013 which takes place in the final chapters. The final scenes still linger in my mind.</p> <h2>8. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9781407132082/the-hunger-games\" title=\"\">The Hunger Games</a> by Suzanne Collins</h2> <p>This, of course, was a major hit both as a book and as a film; I was surprised that both the author and the film-makers were able to get away with such levels of violence. The book presents a brilliantly realised vision of post-apocalyptic America, a country now called Panem, where every year the young are forced to take part in vicious gladiatorial combats (inspired by the ancient story of King Minos and the Athenians). Katniss Everdeen is a great central character and there's a very clever love triangle at the heart of the action. The series ends with revolution and betrayal \u2026 the second film is already on the way.</p> <h2>9. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780752897844/the-passage\" title=\"\">The Passage</a> by Justin Cronin</h2> <p>I rather enjoyed this 2010 novel, which adds vampire-like monsters and a lethal virus to the apocalyptic mix. Starting with a top-secret military stronghold in Colorado, where prisoners are being injected with some sort of serum to turn them into super-soldiers, the book leaps 90 years forward to a colony of survivors in a suitably ravaged world. A bit confusing in places, but I'm looking forward to the sequel and to the film which is apparently on the way.</p> <h2>10. The Bible</h2> <p>Perhaps a strange choice to finish with but this is actually where I began. \"Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.\" It may be short on description, but this still remains one of the most potent end-of-the-world stories, somehow ingrained in my childhood. For spectacular visuals to accompany it, you might look at <a href=\"http://eng-glos.blogspot.co.uk/2011/11/john-martin-1789-1854-british-romantic.html\" title=\"\">the works of the Victorian painter John Martin</a>. The story of Noah is equally compelling, but for real gut-churning terror you need to look at the Revelation of St John, with its teeming monsters and buckets of blood. At the end of the day, the bible was the main inspiration for Oblivion.</p>",
  "<h2>1) Two words: Joe Hart</h2> <p>It is easy to get a little carried away in the immediate aftermath of a game but the question that was posed to Roberto Mancini less than a hour after the final whistle, when the Manchester City manager was asked whether he had ever seen a better goalkeeping performance, still feels valid the following morning. Mancini's English is still developing but the Italian picked the right word <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/04/roberto-mancini-joe-hart-manchester-city\" title=\"\">when he described Hart's display as \"incredible\"</a>. The England international made eight superb saves to frustrate a brilliant Borussia Dortmund side <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/03/manchester-city-borussia-dortmund-champions-league\" title=\"\">that ran riot at the Etihad</a>, slicing through City's defence time and again only to be frustrated by the man that Mancini had told a fortnight earlier to \"stay in goal and make saves\". Hart did that and more against Dortmund. Now it is time for Mancini to earn his money. City, without a clean sheet since they won at Newcastle in May, are an accident waiting to happen when they are without the ball. <strong>SJ</strong></p> <h2>2) There could be pain coming from Ukraine for Chelsea</h2> <p>There has been much gushing about the growing Brazilian influence at Chelsea but their next two ties in Group E pit them against a team who may just be able to out-samba them. The Brazilian quartet of Willian, Alex Teixeira, Luiz Adriano and Fernandinho were superb as Shakhtar Donetsk gave Juventus the run-around <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/02/juventus-shakhtar-donetsk-champions-league\" title=\"\">in the lopsided draw in Italy</a> on Tuesday and they look well equipped to pose Chelsea plenty of problems too. Given that Nordsjaelland, despite their skill and valour, look likely to finish the group with zero points, Chelsea could yet be made pay <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/sep/19/chelsea-juventus-champions-league\" title=\"\">for letting a two-goal lead slip in their first game</a>. <strong>PD</strong></p> <h2>3) Ronaldo has cheered up \u2026 we think</h2> <p>If Cristiano Ronaldo is still down in the dumps, his second hat-trick in four days should have given him a small boost. He has now scored 12 goals in 10 games this season (Lionel Messi has a mere 10 in 10) but it's not just about the numbers. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/03/ajax-real-madrid-champions-league\" title=\"\">Wednesday night's hat-trick</a> contained a poacher's tap-in, a long-range finish and a burst of pace followed by an exquisite chip. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho will also be pleased with the contribution of Kak\u00e1, who you may remember being half decent way back in the mists of time. <strong>TL</strong></p> <h2>4) Lennon has inspired a mental revolution at Celtic</h2> <p>It is annoying that commentators kept claiming that Celtic had not won away in Europe's top competition since 1986 \u2013 what foul strain of snootiness decrees that victories before the group stages suddenly don't count? - but it is still true that Celtic have generally been fodder away from home in recent times. The only really plausible explanation for the discrepancy between their formidable home form and feeble away displays is mental weakness. But <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/02/spartak-moscow-celtic-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the assured win in Moscow</a> confirmed that Lennon has banished the inferiority complex that Celtic used to pack in their baggage. Following the wins in the qualifying rounds at Helsinki and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/aug/21/helsingborg-celtic-champions-league-play-off\" title=\"\">Helsingborg</a>, this, a couple of defensive lapses notwithstanding, was another accomplished performance in which Celtic showed sound balance, energy, canniness and moments of class to earn a fully deserved victory. <strong>PD</strong></p> <h2>5) Life after Van Persie for Arsenal</h2> <p>The sale of Robin van Persie has done Arsenal little harm, even if he is thriving at Manchester United. Two goalless games at the start of the season seemed gloomy portents for Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's team but there may be a broader strength to the lineup as the restructuring continues. Arsenal have scored 21 times in their last seven matches. The team is far from perfect but it is certainly not toothless, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/03/arsenal-olympiakos-champions-league\" title=\"\">as the 3-1 victory over Olympiakos showed</a>. Aaron Ramsey found the net for the first time since February. There have also been wins away <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/02/liverpool-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">to Liverpool </a>and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/18/montpellier-arsenal-champions-league\" title=\"\">Montpellier</a>, as well as a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/23/manchester-city-arsenal-match-report\" title=\"\">1-1 draw at Manchester City</a>. <strong>KM</strong></p> <h2>6) Goncharenko will be in business for a long time</h2> <p>Unlike his hapless Grange Hill name-sake, 'Gonch' is reaping lavish reward for his enterprise and looks destined to go on to even greater things, as opposed to beatings from Mauler McCaul. Since taking charge of Bate Borisov in 2007 at the tender age of 30, Viktor Goncharenko has overseen seen steady annual improvement: Bate have won their domestic league four years in a row and qualified for the Champions League group stages three times: this season they yielded their first win at that stage when they trounced Lille 3-1 and on Tuesday they pulled off their finest feat to date, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/02/bate-borisov-bayern-munich-champions-league\" title=\"\">beating Bayern Munich</a> thanks to swift and deadly counterattacking that should make them a menace to any opponent. If Russian teams are flunking so far, it is partially because they do not have managers as shrewd as this Belarussian. <strong>PD</strong></p> <h2>7) M\u00e1laga are building up steam</h2> <p>M\u00e1laga are currently third in La Liga, behind only Barcelona and a Falcao-inspired Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Their form in the Champions League isn't too shabby either. Isco was the star last month when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/18/malaga-zenit-st-petersburg-champions-league\" title=\"\">they brushed aside Zenit St Petersburg</a> but they showed they're not a one-man team <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/03/anderlecht-malaga-champions-league\" title=\"\">on Wednesday night against Anderlecht</a>. Eliseu scored two brilliant goals, including a long-range strike that travelled so fast there would have been a nasty injury if anyone had managed to get in the its way. M\u00e1laga aren't just an attacking force though: in four games (including the qualifier against Panathinaikos) they are yet to concede a goal. <strong>TL</strong></p> <h2>8) Ferguson is still trying to learn</h2> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson's capacity to adapt is widely hailed as the key to his enduring success. And the septuagenarian is at it again as he attempts to mend Manchester United's ailing European ways. Having been outplayed by everyone last term in both the Champions League and the Europa League, and even by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/19/champions-league-manchester-united-galatasaray\" title=\"\">Galatasaray in the first match of this campaig</a>n, Ferguson tried a wingless formation on Tuesday night that was virtually unprecedented for United. Antonio Valencia, Nani and Ashley Young were all left out as Ferguson packed the centre in an effort to secure greater control of an area where United have been second best too often. It worked insofar as United enjoyed the lion's share of possession and the lack of width did not prove too costly. The big question is will it work <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/03/wayne-rooney-robin-van-persie\" title=\"\">against better opponents than Cluj</a>. <strong>PD</strong></p> <h2>9) Some of the finishing this season has been ridiculous</h2> <p>As Jeff Stelling pointed out, there have been 93 goals so far in the Champions League this season, the highest total in 10 years. It's easy to see why. While the group stages can often be stodgy, some of the finishing this year has been a delight to watch. On Wednesday night we were treated to three chipped finishes (in ascending order of cheek: Aaron Ramsey, Cristiano Ronaldo and Eliseu); a curling, raking shot across the keeper (Porto's James Rodr\u00edguez) and an amazing bicycle kick (Karim Benzema). Roll on the highlights shows. <strong>TL</strong></p> <h2>10) There are still gems to be discovered</h2> <p>In this era of media saturation where the toils of the mainstream organs are augmented by every fan and his blog, it often seems like we know far more than we need to about many clubs and players (and many other subjects). Over-exposure is rife and, conversely, it is rare that a player makes it to the Champions League group stages without us having already been force-fed large helpings of hype about him. This week, however, several such players emerged if not quite from obscurity than at least from the relative shade: Nordsjaelland's 21-year-old centre-back Jores Okore put in such a superb performance against Chelsea that he seems certain to star at this level for years to come; the same can be said of Bate Borisov full-back Dzyanis Palyakow, whose constant raids down the right were as terrifying to Bayern Munich as they were thrilling to fans; and it is surely only a matter of time before this little-known Georgios Samaras character marauding around for Celtic is snapped up by some billionaire-backed elite club, such as Manchester City. <strong>PD</strong></p>",
  "<p><strong>When should the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) be able take over and put a stop to a private prosecution?</strong></p> <p>Funny you should ask. The supreme court is being asked exactly the same thing on Thursday.</p> <p><strong>What's the case?</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/current-cases/CCCaseDetails/case_2011_0115.html\" title=\"\">R (on the application of Gujra) (FC) v CPS</a>. You can even <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/info/supreme-court\" title=\"\">watch the hearing live</a>.</p> <p><strong>What's it all about?</strong></p> <p>Dalvinder Singh Gujra alleged that in 2010 he was assaulted by Tamoor and Imran Mirza in front of two witnesses because he'd given evidence in civil proceedings against them. He also claimed to have been threatened and intimidated by Wajeed Mirza while driving in Southampton city centre. He started a private prosecution against them in September 2010.</p> <p><strong>Can't see the problem.</strong></p> <p>Then the CPS took the case over and discontinued it.</p> <p><strong>That might cause a row.</strong></p> <p>Quite. In October 2010 the CPS reviewed the evidence and took the view there was no realistic prospect of convicting anyone because there was not enough evidence. In November, after notifying Gujra's solicitors, the CPS took over and discontinued the proceedings. Gujra applied for judicial review of the CPS decision and is appealing against an <a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2011/472.html\" title=\"\">order made in the Queen's Bench Divisional Court in March 2011</a>.</p> <p><strong>What is the supreme court being asked to do?</strong></p> <p>People have the right to bring private prosecutions under section 6(1) of the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/23\" title=\"\">Prosecution of Offences Act 1985</a>. Lady Hale and Lords Neuberger, Mance, Kerr and Wilson will look at whether the current CPS policy on taking these proceedings in order to discontinue them is lawful and whether the decision taken in Gujra's case was rational.</p> <p>The CPS policy introduced in 2009 allows the CPS to take over and put a stop to cases where it considers there is insufficient evidence to produce a conviction. In an <a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/1999/286.html\" title=\"\">earlier case involving a private prosecution against two retired police officers</a>, in connection with the Hillsborough disaster, Lord Laws said that it would not be right for the director of public prosecutions to apply the \"reasonable prospect of conviction\" test when making the decision. \"The consequence would be that the DPP [director of public prosecutions] would stop a private prosecution merely on the ground that the case is not one which he would himself proceed with,\" he said. \"The very premise of s6(1) must be that some cases will go to trial which the DPP himself chooses not to prosecute.\"</p> <p><strong>Why is this case so important?</strong></p> <p>We can't and shouldn't have to rely on prosecuting authorities always doing the right thing. While the attorney general has long held power to end proceedings by entering a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolle_prosequi\" title=\"\">nolle prosequi</a> and the DPP, Keir Starmer, can take control of a private prosecution under a 1908 statute and under the 1985 Act, the entitlement of ordinary members of the public to bring private criminal proceedings is intended as a safety net against failures, refusals and wrongdoing on the part of those whose job it is to bring public prosecutions.</p> <p><strong>Quite topical isn't it?</strong></p> <p>Yes, in the ongoing extradition case featuring Abu Hamza and four others suspected of terrorism, Phillippa Kaufmann QC has <a href=\"http://http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/03/abu-hamza-depression-court\" title=\"\">questioned the refusal</a> of the DPP to consent to a private prosecution of Babar Ahmad</p> <p><strong>Any notable private prosecutions?</strong></p> <p>Stephen Lawrence's family <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jan/03/stephen-lawrence-murder-timeline\" title=\"\">instigated a private prosecution</a> against men accused of murdering him in 1994. The case collapsed after the identification evidence of a key witness was ruled inadmissible, but after the abolition, in 2005, of the double jeopardy principle, which prevented suspects being tried twice for the same crime, a successful prosecution was brought by the CPS, which included new evidence. In January this year Gary Dobson, 36, and David Norris, 35, were <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jan/04/dobson-norris-murder-stephen-lawrence\" title=\"\">found guilty of murder</a>.</p> <p><em>Do you have a cases of interest coming up? </em><a href=\"mailto:law@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\"><em>Let us know</em></a><em> </em></p>",
  "<p>When you think about your website's SEO, you think about Google. Sure, you might do a quick check over at Yahoo and Bing to make sure what you're doing works there too but let's face it, your SEO tactics are pretty Google-centric. When you want a new site recognised, you have to tell Google about it. You register the URL with them, invite a bit of googlebot crawling and wait to see the results.</p> <p>For me, one of the fundamental things to remember about Google+ is that it lets Google know your pages are there. At the basic level, you should have Google+, along with StumbleUpon, Digg, Delicious, <a href=\"http://zootool.com/\" title=\"\">Zootool</a> and <a href=\"http://www.diigo.com/\" title=\"\">Diigo</a> as one of the social bookmarking sites that need to know about your content. Admittedly these aren't the strong back links that you get from a high-ranking site like the Guardian for example, but they are important none the less.</p> <p>So, lesson one: make your content shareable on Google+. In the same way that you add \"like\" and \"tweet this\" buttons, include \"+1\" as an option \u2013 it may not be in your communications plan yet, but G+ should at least be in your SEO one.</p> <p>What about the platform itself? There have been many articles written about how unpopular Google+ is as a social network. However, let's face it, that's what makes a great headline. The truth is a little muddier and a little less predictable. Social networking is not a new thing; the online community has been engaging in it for years through chat rooms, online gaming and so on. Mainstream social networking for those outside of the tech community is relatively new in comparison.</p> <p>With this in mind, it's worth remembering that it took Facebook a little longer than G+ has been around to catch up with Myspace. We're all talking about Pinterest and Instagram but they have far fewer numbers and are limited in that they're predominantly image based interactions. Add that to the fact that Google themselves are promoting G+ as a hub for Google services rather than a social network and the water just keeps getting muddier.</p> <p>So, do you need to have a Google+ page as part of your communications plan? Any social network is time consuming to get right so ask yourself: is your audience there? Are your competitors there? What will you be able to get out of it? Many organisations jump on a network because they feel they should be there without taking the time to work out if their audience is active on that network. Worse still, people write off social networking because they think it's just for teenagers \u2013 WRONG.</p> <p>If you're unsure about any of the above, that's fine. Don't add Google+ to your marketing strategy just yet. However, don't let it fall off your radar \u2013 you may not need a corporate profile but you do need to understand it and be ready to include it if and when the time is right.</p> <p>Also, why not use it for internal comms? Hangouts are great for conference calling, interviewing, and talking to colleagues in other offices. The events function is easy to use, well designed and integrates with Google Calendar, so use it for arranging meetings and sharing pictures from office events, product launches etc. This will not only be useful, it will ensure that if and when you do go live with G+ for comms, your staff know and enjoy using it.</p> <p>I am a tart when it comes to technology and I play with and test things mercilessly until I can confirm their usefulness. At the moment I'm getting a lot out of using Google+. It's maybe not exactly where it needs to be and not all businesses will find it essential, but that's the same for any network. It is definitely worth the watching (as my mum would say).</p> <p>How have you used Google+ and how do you find it?

  "<p>The culture sector has begun to make a shift from using social media with a purely marketing focus, to sharing processes and insights. It's a step in the right direction for creating community engagement, but it's also a work in progress \u2013 and in the absence of standards and precedence it can be pretty daunting to figure out where to make a start.</p> <p>Things are further complicated by the fact that most of us distribute our digital lives across several social networks as well as different devices and screens. Our notions of conversation are also constantly challenged. </p> <p>Figuring out how to create engagement in the midst of all this chaos raises several questions: can we share this responsibility across an arts organisation? And how do we start to make this shift?</p> <h2>Model your digital space as a communal playground</h2> <p>Engineering and forcing conversations with online communities should be abandoned altogether \u2013 it creates pressure to be constantly switched on, and often results in a resistance from the community to be engaged. Everyone has something better to do than perform (what is perceived as) the role of a salesperson.</p> <p>Consider the alternative. Think of the digital space as a playground: different groups will form over time, across multiple social websites or within one network. The trick is to moderate activity across these groups and encourage cross-connections, not control this space in its entirety. The added advantage is that when the occasional argument breaks out, it can be easily contained.</p> <p>Conversations in this space can be based on an approach that works quite well in conferences \u2013 using social media for collective note taking. In addition to producing great insights and thoughtful commentary, it also creates room for everyone to participate without the need for role play.</p> <p>From an organisational perspective, it's important to find a suitable context to put this idea into action. For example, <a href=\"http://reachadvisors.typepad.com/museum_audience_insight/2012/09/meaningful-museum-experiences-its-the-cool-stuff.html\" title=\"\">this survey of 4,000 museum visitors</a> shows that a connection to content creates meaningful experiences in museums. Curators and members of the public can exist alongside each other, talking about their individual experiences. It creates multiple threads of conversations, making it possible for curators to speak to their peers, to members of the public, or for museum visitors to talk to each other.</p> <h2>Encourage a culture of prototyping ideas</h2> <p>With a squeeze on resources, everyone is expected to do more with less. This pressure can be alleviated by inviting contributions from online communities, which is great, but we often persist only in sharing end results and outcomes \u2013 talking about how an exhibition was conceived after it has gone live is very different from sharing developmental processes in real time.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/may/28/prototyping-replaces-policy-arts-culture?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Prototyping ideas</a> on the other hand is a great approach to co-production that can create shared ownership among a range of stakeholders. This format is already used in the tech industry to encourage different groups to collaborate and find sustainable solutions. Implementing this approach isn't the same as a crowd-sourcing activity where it can be difficult to manage the volume of information that's generated. A more pragmatic approach would be to find a niche platform, and define the core values of the community you want to create.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/apr/20/artstack-social-network-art-tool\" title=\"\">ArtStack</a> is a great example of a niche social network. Galleries can share their collections online to prototype exhibitions based on discussions with a well-informed community. The advantage is that you can create a potential audience and grow your virtual network, while creating a physical event.</p> <h2>Impact vs metrics</h2> <p>It's easy to be seduced by the volume of likes on Facebook and RTs on Twitter, but these metrics don't necessarily benefit the approach of engagement based on creating authentic voices. The need to engage communities will continue to grow, and while technology makes it very easy to create and share content, we are constantly adding to the pool of transient data. What tends to stick in this fast moving landscape are ideas.</p> <p>The people behind these ideas need to be able to use digital to drive meaningful change. For example, by encouraging intellectual consumption of digital archives, or by creating a culture of sharing emotional responses as metadata.</p> <p>The problem behind implementing this vision is that individual practitioners often consider the idea of getting online communities to participate in specific tasks as manipulation, which is a result of the perception that engagement is about sales and marketing.</p> <p>For the culture sector to thrive we need to enable practitioners to communicate both ideas and intention with clarity online. And this begins by finding a unique voice.</p> <p><em>Creating a unique voice online will be the subject of two digital seminars Abhay is facilitating for the Guardian Culture Professionals Network \u2013 find out more </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network/events\" title=\"\"><em>here</em></a><em> and don't forget there is a 20% discount for network members (</em><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/culture-professionals/start.php\" title=\"\"><em>sign up for free here</em></a><em>)</em></p> <p><em>Abhay Adhikari is a digital strategist for the arts, education and voluntary sectors \u2013 follow him on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gopaldass\" title=\"\"><em>@gopaldass</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The US Federal Trade Commission has carried out a huge international crackdown on a number of \"tech support\" scams being run out of India which have conned people in the UK, US, Canada and elsewhere out of millions of pounds since 2008.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/18/phone-scam-india-call-centres\" title=\"\">explained by the Guardian in 2010</a>, the scams used \"boiler room\" tactics, dialling through phone books for English-speaking countries. People who answered the phone were told the call came from Microsoft or their internet service provider, and that the person's computer was \"reporting viruses\". The caller would then perform an unnecessary \"fix\" on the computer and charge the person for it \u2013 and sometimes sign them up to multi-year \"support\" contracts. The cost could run to hundreds of pounds.</p> <p>People in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand were targeted because they, like the people carrying out the scam, are English-speaking. The Guardian understands that the scam was worth millions of pounds a year to the organised gangs carrying it out.</p> <p>At the <a href=\"http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2012/10/pecon.shtm\" title=\"\">FTC's request in six cases</a>, a federal district judge froze the US assets of 17 people and 14 companies that have been accused of taking part in the operations. The FTC has also shut down 80 internet domain names and 130 phone numbers used in the US to carry out the scams.</p> <p>The FTC is seeking an end to the scams, and repayments for people who were conned out of money.</p> <p>Though the FTC said it could not put a figure on how many people had been scammed, or how much they had lost, Microsoft \u2013 which has been working with the commission for the past two years to try to catch the criminals \u2013 provided data on more than a thousand people who had been scammed, whose losses averaged $875 each.</p> <p>Microsoft has repeatedly pointed out that it would not call people about any problems with their computers. In some cases, the scammers would try to sell antivirus software from reputable companies, and in some cases would install new copies of Windows on a machine. However the licence key used on the software allowed Microsoft to trace it back to its buyer, which aided the investigation.</p> <p>The fraud occurred in several English-speaking countries. Joining the FTC in the enforcement action were the Australian Communications and Media Authority, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission and the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency. David Vladeck, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said it was working with law enforcement officials in India to catch the alleged perpetrators. The commission has also referred the cases to the US justice department for possible criminal prosecution.</p> <p>The companies whose assets have been frozen are: Pecon Software; PC Care247; Connexxions Infotech; Connexxions IT Services Private Ltd; Zeal IT Solutions; Lakshmi Infosoul Services Private Ltd; Virtual PC Solutions, First PC Solution; Direct PC Solution; Virtual IT Supports; Global Innovative Service; 24x7pchelp; 24x7pctech; Transfront Solutions; New World Services; Megabites Solutions; Mega Bits; Greybytes Cybertech; Bluesystemcare; Shine Solutions Private Ltd. The FTC has also named 17 people who were singly or together directors of the accused companies.</p> <p>The companies involved had US locations which were used to funnel money back to India. Some also have UK offices. However the FTC asserts that the companies used \"virtual\" offices which were in fact just mail-forwarding facilities. The scam also used voice-over-internet phone lines to make them appear to be calling from inside the country being targeted, when in fact the caller was in India.</p> <p>The Guardian's own investigations have found that one gang was using locations and accounts in Canada to transfer money from the scams back to India.</p> <p>The defendants have been charged with violating the FTC Act, which bars \"unfair and deceptive\" commercial practices, breaching the Telemarketing Sales Rule and illegally calling numbers that are on the National Do Not Call Registry.</p> <p>The scheme involved getting a computer user to look at a program called \"Event Viewer\" that is a standard part of the Windows operating system. That displays logs of events occurring on the computer, sometimes with the label \"Warning\" or \"Error\" \u2013 but which in fact have no significance to the smooth running of the computer. The caller would then say that these were due to \"viruses\", that they had been alerted to them remotely, and that they could fix them. They then would use a remote login program to appear to \"fix\" the computer.</p> <p>\"Clearly the defendant's [modus operandi] was to exploit these fears about malware hiding in the machine,\" said the FTC chairman, Jon Leibowitz. \"These scams fleeced English-speaking consumers worldwide likely to the tune of tens of millions of dollars and resulted in innumerable Do Not Call violations in the US.\"</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.eno.org/home.php\" title=\"\">English National Opera</a> (ENO) is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/03/damon-albarn-kickstarts-eno-opera-scheme\" title=\"\">launching a campaign</a> to prove that their art form is not the preserve of a cultural elite. The campaign is being fronted by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/03/damon-albarn-kickstarts-eno-opera-scheme\" title=\"\">Damon Albarn and Terry Gilliam</a>. Gilliam is quoted as having said: \"I thought opera was for a bunch of old farts \u2013 the bourgeoisie in dinner jackets. I thought it was an art form for the rich and successful and almost dead.\" Ignoring for a moment how many of those attributes might apply to the men leading the campaign, the ENO is encouraging audiences to turn up in trainers, jeans, and enjoy club-style interval bars. This is a counterproductive campaign, which not only presents a misleading impression of what modern opera audiences are like, but also misses the point.</p> <p>Few opera houses still have a rigid dress code of the sort Terry Gilliam describes. Neither the venerable <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal Opera House</a> nor the iconic <a href=\"http://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/\" title=\"\">Sydney Opera House</a> demand that their audience wear dinner jackets, nor do you have to be rich to go to them. If you booked early, you'd have been able to go see the second opera in <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/about/the-ring\" title=\"\">Wagner's Ring Cycle</a> in Covent Garden tonight for less than the cost of a cinema ticket. Nobody will refuse you if you do not dress smartly.</p> <p>In this country when people talk about opera and dinner jackets, they are likely to be referring to somewhere like <a href=\"http://glyndebourne.com/\" title=\"\">Glyndebourne</a>. There are few rarer and more memorable sights than the incongruous platform at Lewes train station filled entirely with men and women in black tie and ballgowns waiting to board the service to Victoria. It is a window into how the past might have looked, but there are at least two reasons why it should not to be dismissed out of hand.</p> <p>The first and most significant reason is that the dinner jacket is, as David Mitchell remarked, a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66c7el1E11o&amp;feature=channel\" title=\"\">\"tremendously reassuring\" way for men to look unusually smart</a>. As such, it is in its own way, it is an outfit which is extremely democratic. Before this article collects dozens of angry comments that suggest I must be living in a world of gin cocktails, aviaries, and quails' eggs I would add that you can pick up a dinner jacket at M&amp;S for less than the price of a pair of trainers, and certainly less than the price of a whole outfit of the sort that Damon Albarn might wear to go to the ENO. Another reason that a dress code is democratic in that you know in advance what you're supposed to wear, rather than having to spend some time working out what might be acceptable, only to be condemned silently for misjudging an unwritten code when you arrive.</p> <p>Opera may not be popular culture, but at least you know what you're getting: people usually singing in foreign languages about love, death, power etc with accompanying surtitles and a couple of drinks at half-time. Contrast opera with some contemporary performance art, and opera then seems readily accessible. It is like comparing Tate Britain with Tate Modern \u2013 it might seem old-fashioned, but the paintings are often more comprehensible to the first-time viewer than their modern alternatives. Cultural elitism is to be found in those places where there appear to be no rules, no obvious codes, but where the obscure knowledge needed to be involved is the preserve of a small group whose false claim to democracy is that they don't wear a black tie.</p> <p>The second reason is that where dressing up is a part of the opera experience, it is not only a tribute to the efforts of the singers and orchestra, but in a sense it is a tribute to the occasion. Just as football or rugby fans dress in solidarity with the players on the pitch, so the audience mirrors the orchestra pit. One of the things that we do well in Britain is formal clothing. We are much better at it than we are at dressing casually. We tend to dress up for special occasions, be they parties, weddings, or other forms of social occasion. In doing so, we lend both obvious effort and respect to what is being undertaken, and create a unique atmosphere.</p> <p>When you watch and hear an opera you are experiencing the distillation of hundreds of thousands of hours of work, and the creative genius of a large group of people. Since childhood those boys and girls have sung, plucked strings, sketched costumes, learnt about lighting and sound, and behind it all (invariably) one man has written a work of complexity and vision.</p> <p>My grandmother came from a working-class northern background to be conducted by Sir Simon Rattle, and she did not do so because she belonged to a cultural elite, but because she saw the beauty of an art form which is there for anyone to enjoy, and because she worked her guts out to perfect her singing voice. The same goes for opera companies the world over, and it's arguable that the very least we could do is to pay the respect of turning up for the occasion dressed like we care.</p>",
  "<p>The first rule is that there are no rules \u2013 you're writing a review to express your thoughts and feelings about a theatre show, not taking an exam. There are as many ways to write a review as there are personal responses to any production. There is no right or wrong. Allow yourself to develop <a href=\"http://westendwhingers.wordpress.com/\">your own distinctive voice</a>, and be honest about what you really think about a production: convey your enthusiasm for it or explain why you disliked it. Don't worry about going out on a limb. A timid theatre review is often a dull read. The hardest reviews to write are not about the shows you <a href=\"http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/look-back-in-anger\">passionately loved</a> or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2008/jan/28/theatre2\">hated</a>, but about ones that were just so-so. </p> <p>If you are aiming to get your review published in a newspaper or on <a href=\"http://exeuntmagazine.com/reviews/\">a reviews website</a>, then you will need to write your review to a certain length and to fit a particular format. Make sure you do your homework about the length and style of reviews of a particular publication, online or otherwise, before you approach them. A <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/oct/02/charley-s-aunt-review\">traditional theatre review often begins</a> by giving the reader some background about a production, a brief outline of plot and themes, a sense of what the staging looks (and sounds) like; it offers an evaluation of writing, production and performances and concludes with a summing up. It's pretty basic GCSE coursework stuff. (Coursework that I suspect I might fail if I had to do it.)</p> <p>But it doesn't have to be like that. Particularly in the digital age, when a theatre review can be a succinct and witty 140-character critique on Twitter, an occasional or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/stoon1\">regular response</a> on the comment threads of Guardian reviews or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatreblog/2012/sep/28/lyn-gardner-theatre-tips\">my weekly What to see blog</a>, or a piece of writing on <a href=\"http://theatrenotes.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/review-heretic.html\">a blog</a> that runs to many hundreds of words and uses the production as a springboard to discuss wider issues. The last of these often sits somewhere on a line between academic criticism and broadsheet reviews; some of the most exciting blog commentary is trying to create a genuine and informed <a href=\"http://statesofdeliquescence.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/fanning-bonfire.html \">dialogue</a> between those making the work and those writing about it; still more <a href=\"http://postcardsgods.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/love-and-information-royal-court.html \">matches the form of the show</a> with critical response. Smart theatre publicists and marketing departments know these bloggers are invaluable and will facilitate access by offering free tickets to those who write regularly and engagingly.</p> <p>Blogging has changed the world of theatre criticism, and for the better. A wider range of voices on many different platforms isn't challenging the authority of us full-time theatre critics but broadening it. It may never have been as hard to get paid for writing theatre criticism, but it has never been easier to be noticed for writing it and to gain yourself an audience for what you write. </p> <p>I've been learning on the job for the last 30 years, and am still learning with every review I write. The best advice I can offer is to see as much theatre as you can, write about everything that you see, and always write reviews that really reflect what you felt about a show \u2013 not what you think you ought to have felt about it. Oh, and have fun. If you don't have fun writing the review, nobody will have fun reading it.</p>",

  "<p>Like it or loath it, advertising plays an important role in our social fabric. It helps to start trends, propel cultural identities and keep us informed about the latest products and services. Advertising has, however, always suffered accusations of manipulation, exploitation and misleading audiences. Marketing will always have its strengths and its weaknesses, these will largely amount to the way in which brands either exploit potential consumers or use advertising as a long term brand positioning tool, creating demand and loyalty.</p> <p>With consumers being perpetually bombarded by messages, many have perfected the ability to 'tune-out'. Over the past few years the channels available to advertisers and promoters have expanded dramatically \u2013 we now have seven mass channels: outdoor, print, radio, cinema, TV, online and mobile. Each has its place in the marketing mix, but mobile has the ability to act as a glue that binds the others.</p> <p>When used with other types of advertising, mobile is an incredibly powerful platform that has the ability to deliver measurable results about engagement and make the advert contextually relevant. For example, the campaigns from <a href=\"http://blippar.com/\" title=\"\">Blippar</a>, the augmented reality company, makes advertising and products come alive to let users know about local offers, changes to prices or shop locations. And one of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/07/tesco-virtual-supermarket-gatwick-airport?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Tesco's recent campaigns</a> allows consumers to use an advertising board at Gatwick to purchase groceries using their phones. This mix of outdoor and mobile ads help consumers feel engaged with the brand and shows how public acceptance of using mobile to interact with other forms of advertising has increased.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/\" title=\"\">A TIME magazine</a> study found 68% of people sleep with their phone next to their bed. It's also the first thing most of us look at before going to bed, and the first thing we wake up to. Nokia once stated that on average someone looks at their phone 150 times per day! While we may upgrade to a newer model every few years, we are well and truly attached to our mobiles. For the marketing community, this is profound. Recent studies have shown that when it comes to effectiveness, mobile marketing campaigns perform better than traditional channels in terms of awareness, recall, action and decision-making.</p> <p>Research recently released by the <a href=\"http://www.iabuk.net/\" title=\"\">Internet Advertising Bureau</a> shows that only 40% of the top 100 brands have mobile-optimised websites. Such websites get more consumer attention with an average time of 5 minutes \u2013 2 minutes longer than for advertisers without a mobile web presence. If people can't easily find company information relevant to their needs, it is the company that loses out.</p> <p>Further research, this time from the <a href=\"http://www.online-publishers.org/\" title=\"\">Online Publishers Association</a> shows that 39% of consumers using a smartphone were driven to take action after seeing an ad. Also, 15% of all smartphone content consumers have clicked on an ad compared to the 0.2% online click rate.</p> <p>Because of the intimacy, targeted nature and increasing functionality of mobile devices (for example mobile payments), we are reaching the point where contextual relevance advertising can really kick off. This would mean that ads can be targeted to us based on who we are, where we are and what we may want. While this may sound like a privacy and personal information barrage, technology now exists to allow users to control exactly what information they give away, and the type of advertising they are happy to receive directly from their phones. This allows mobile advertising to deliver information relevant to an individual, adapting its message to the time, weather and location to have the best impact.</p> <p>Mobile advertising accounted for 1.06% of the total spend on advertising last year ($5.3bn out of $498bn). But companies are now rapidly increasing their mobile ad budgets.</p> <p>A lot is at stake. Facebook is implementing a mobile ad strategy. It currently has 550 million monthly mobile users who aren't seeing the adverts they would otherwise see from a computer. In 2011, Google's gross revenue from mobile ads brought $2.5bn for the company.</p> <p>But there are still hurdles to cross when it comes to dealing with privacy and data protection, there is no denying the power and targeted reach of mobile. Its relevance will only grow. The digital generation who live through their phones or have a mobile device in their hands when they are consuming other media, which is now being called 'double screening', have embraced it.</p> <p>Delivering advertising that is relevant to an individual's interests, preferences, wants and needs means that the validity, importance and value of mobile advertising will increase with time. It will not be long until services like Apple's Siri are developed to act as true personal recommendation engines.</p> <p><em>James Hilton is CEO at </em><a href=\"http://www.mcsaatchi.com/\" title=\"\"><em>M&amp;C Saatchi Mobile</em></a></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/media-network/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> to the </strong><a href=\"http://guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

He said:</p> <blockquote> The second quarter commentary was better than our expectations, with volume growth in speciality food ingredients (against a tough comp) key.

There's a particular reason for me to be nominating ZZ Top for this slot today. Tomorrow I'll be flying to the US to interview Billy Gibbons, Dusty Hill and Frank Beard, and to see them play at the Merriweather Post Pavilion in Maryland. And, yes, I'm insanely excited about it.</p> <p>Master of Sparks comes from ZZ Top's third album, 1973's <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/tres-hombres-mw0000193231\">Tres Hombres</a>, their first big hit record. I bought it in a mall in Provo, Utah, on a family holiday, largely on the strength of it featuring <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kbkSU98vlE\">Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers</a>, which had been covered by Mot\u00f6rhead. I was expecting a metal record. A fortnight later we got home and my first impression was I'd been sold a pup.</p> <p>First impressions are often wrong, though. It didn't take long for Tres Hombres to insinuate itself into my affections. First came the rockers, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na25s0F-jeg\">Beer Drinkers \u2026</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjERS4v4QYI\">Le Grange</a>. Then the poppier ones \u2013 Move Me On Down the Line. But the one that came to fascinate me, and the one I now love best, is Master of Sparks.</p> <p>It's a spooky song: I think it's a lap steel that quavers away through the verses, giving it the sound of something picked up from some ghostly radio station far off in the lost lands. It feels like it always existed somewhere in the remote vastness of America, a song blown across the deserts and the plains until ZZ Top picked it up and recorded it.</p> <p>Lyrically, too, it's a perfect little piece \u2013 a man is persuaded by his friends to come and see just what's on there minds: \"And then I took my first long look/ At the Master of Sparks on high.\" The Master of Sparks is a race car \u2013 maybe a dragster, maybe a stock car, but certainly one that moves \"like a stick of rollin' dynamite\" \u2013 but the way Billy Gibbons sings about it, you'd assume it was a supernatural being at the very least. Nevertheless, it has powers beyond our hero's control, as he discovers in the song's last line. Yes: this is a Sunset Boulevard of a number, narrated from beyond the grave.</p> <p>I'll beware of invitations to jump into any souped-up roadsters this weekend, O think.</p>",
  "<p>Under Tony Blair's Labour administration, antisocial behaviour was high on the agenda and so too were the expectations on social landlords to tackle it.</p> <p>In a blaze of publicity we saw the creation of new tools and powers: the together campaign, the <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/landlordtoolkit\" title=\"\">respect standard for housing management</a> and the Asbo. The jury is still out on whether these have had a positive impact on landlords and the communities affected by antisocial behaviour (ASB), but it is clear that it got the housing sector focused on a problem that is regularly named as a high priority for tenants.</p> <p>So what has happened over the last five years? Under Gordon Brown, the final years of the Labour government attempted to move away from media soundbites such as \"respect\" and \"tackling, not tolerating\". What remained was a woolly agenda on behaviour and standards that practitioners did not understand. Now we have the coalition government promising to cut bureaucracy, to make it quicker, easier and cheaper for landlords to take action against disruptive tenants and for communities to hold them to account for their failures.</p> <p>Some have claimed the new ASB white paper, published in May this year, amounts to the same New Labour tools and powers re-announced with new names. Putting politics aside, there does seem to be some recognition that existing legislation is too complex.</p> <p>The range of acts containing the powers agencies hold, and explaining who can apply for them, can be confusing, giving some landlords the excuse they need not to act. The legislation must be simplified; in serious cases the repossession process should be accelerated, and the criteria for mandatory repossession extended \u2013 and not just as a kneejerk response to last year's city riots.</p> <p>Even if the new white paper looks fine in theory, ASB feels less of a priority for housing providers than it did under Labour. With cuts to public services, the deepest recession in decades, the impact of welfare reform looming and waiting lists increasing amid a fully-fledged housing crisis, do landlords still care about tackling bad behaviour?</p> <p>For landlords, the ASB agenda has not gone away. It remains a high priority for our tenants and will undermine the fabric of our communities and core business if we fail to tackle the problem. It has the power to frustrate us as professionals, but also reminds why we work in social housing.</p> <p>As a landlord with a commitment to social responsibility, it makes sound business sense to invest in ASB services, and it is absolutely right that we continue to challenge behaviour that has a negative impact on communities. Even in this age of austerity, it is paramount that resources to tackle ASB are protected from the inevitable cuts to frontline services.</p> <p>City West has taken the decision to protect this service, and the results are clear: since 2010, we have resolved more than 1,200 cases of antisocial behaviour. We have about 130 legal actions year, primarily taking out injunctions; evictions account for less than 5% of our enforcement action. We still offer a 24-hour reporting service, work closely with police and other agencies, and resolve the majority of cases without the need for legal recourse.</p> <p>If housing associations take their foot off the pedal and attempt to direct, admittedly scarce, resources elsewhere, our tenants would be the first to tell us what they thought about it. We need to understand why tenants use ASB services, and why those who are less confident do not trust their landlord's ability to resolve their problems.</p> <p>Our focus on ASB is at the core of our housing business. Delivery models might change, thanks to emerging government initiatives such as supporting troubled families, but the destabilising impact of ASB if left unchallenged, has not.</p> <p><em>Matt Jones is assistant director of communities and neighbourhoods at </em><a href=\"http://www.citywesthousingtrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>City West Housing Trust</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and best practice in housing finance</strong></p>",
  "<p>The shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, is planning another huge shakeup of the NHS. His statements at this week's Labour conference are couched in terms of getting the structure he would inherit to \"work differently\". The reality is that he is proposing far-reaching change with significant risks for service quality.</p> <p>At a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2012/oct/03/andy-burnham-nhs-reforms-fragmentation\" title=\"\">Guardian healthcare network fringe meeting on Tuesday</a> Burnham said: \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/02/andy-burnham-labour-coalition-nhs?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">The health service would not survive two terms of [David] Cameron</a> \u2026 the NHS would not be a national service at the end.\" Such remarks are a conference ritual; I remember listening to the then shadow health secretary, Robin Cook, warn in 1991 that if Labour lost the election the following year, it may be too late to save the NHS. The Tories got back in, the NHS survived. It will this time as well.</p> <p>Burnham's fears about losing the national character of the NHS are based around increasing use of the private sector, and the fact that competition between hospitals is seeing big trusts surge ahead, while others are struggling.</p> <p>He described the imminent tendering of 396 community services as \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/03/private-contracts-signed-nhs-privatisation\">the single biggest act of privatisation that the NHS has ever seen</a>\", with a total value \"up to a quarter of a billion pounds\". That actually amounts to less than 0.25% of NHS spending, so even if the whole lot went to the private sector it would not make much difference to the current non-NHS proportion (including charities) of around 5%.</p> <p>He wants the NHS to, in effect, return to the \"preferred provider\" policy he tried to pursue during his 11 months as health secretary at the end of Gordon Brown's government. NHS services would routinely win contracts, with use of the private sector being the exception.</p> <p>The risk of the preferred provider model is that it means contracts will go to NHS providers even when the service is inferior to that being offered by the private sector. So you are saying to patients: \"We are knowingly going to provide you with an inferior service because our ideology is more important than the quality of your care.\"</p> <p>Burnham told the conference he wanted to \"remove entirely\" the \"competitive structure that all hospitals and health providers will have to work within\" under the new legislation, and \"restore the legal basis of the NHS to a national, planned, collaborative system \u2026 that's why I need to repeal the market madness that David Cameron has brought to the NHS\".</p> <p>If he intends to pursue this literally, it is not clever. Competition has an important role to play in improving quality, notably with elective surgery. Collaboration and integration are also vital. What matters is what works. (<a href=\"http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/chris-ham-competition-versus-integration-nhs\" title=\"\">Watch King's Fund chief executive Chris Ham neatly summarise how they fit together in a high performing health service.</a>)</p> <p>The concept of autonomous foundation trusts was part of a two-pronged move to raise standards. Inspection and regulation were intended to deal with the worst performers, but it is impossible to regulate your way to excellence. Foundation trusts, freed to compete on quality and efficiency, would be encouraged to attract the finest clinicians, build the best teams and constantly push the boundaries of innovation and excellence. There are examples across the NHS of foundation trust departments providing care that is stunning, even by international standards.</p> <p>Burnham is right, of course, that a good number of hospitals are struggling. But the answer is not to rein in autonomy and ambition; as this column argued two weeks ago, it means taking tough decisions about centralising some services in centres of excellence with higher quality and lower death rates.</p> <p>Pursue ideology or pursue high-quality care \u2013 you can't do both. While unrestrained competition is foolish, centrally planned and controlled healthcare is a recipe for mediocrity. Go down this route and in very few years we will look at the fast-improving quality of care in countries such as Brazil and India and wonder how we failed to keep pace.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/healthcare/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",
  "<p>Back when the economy was booming and junior lawyer jobs grew on trees, having a masters degree in law (LLM) on your CV was seen as highly desirable, with law firms and barristers' chambers valuing the benefits of an extra spell of in-depth legal study. But these days, as the downturn drags on and student debt levels spiral, there is some ambivalence about the wisdom of doing a conventional LLM before you have obtained a pupillage or training contract.</p> <p>Edward Walker, graduate recruitment manager at corporate law firm Pinsent Masons, sums up the prevailing sentiment:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We'd be neutral about a masters, which we don't view as intrinsically better than a year spent working in industry. Chances are, if you haven't met minimum academic requirements by the end of the Legal Practice Course (LPC), you're not going to reach it with a masters. And if you have reached it, but not got a training contract, the gap you have is not academics but elsewhere.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Law schools and universities are alive to this shift in mood, with several introducing new courses to reflect an ever-more competitive legal education market where students are demanding more bang for their buck. Tuesday saw the latest example of this trend, with the College of Law announcing that it is to offer a new combined Legal Practice Course (LPC) and LLM from next year. The new \"LLM LPC\" will enable students to specialise in either international or national legal practice.</p> <p>The former focuses on examining the legal principles, structure and mechanics of cross-border transactions. The latter will be based around exploring general commercial or legal aid practice. According to which modules students take, they will be awarded either an LLM in International Legal Practice or an LLM in Legal Practice. Significantly, the cost and duration of the new course will remain the same as the traditional LPC.</p> <p>The thinking behind the new course was probably fairly similar to that which led City law firm Simmons &amp; Simmons to overhaul its graduate recruitment programme earlier this year and introduce a new requirement that all its future trainees complete a <a href=\"http://l2b.thelawyer.com/simmons-to-put-all-trainees-through-bespoke-mba-course/1013114.article\" title=\"\">firm-sponsored legal MBA</a> alongside their LPCs. From September 2014, future trainees at the firm will begin the MBA during an accelerated LPC at BPP Law School, and then continue the course throughout the two-year duration of their training contracts.</p> <p>Simmons &amp; Simmons' graduate recruitment partner Alex Brown has said that the MBA \u2013 which the firm has been offering on an optional basis since 2009 \u2013 \"adds a lot of value to trainees\". Certainly, it will be interesting to see whether this model or the College of Law's proves more popular with the international law firms who drive the LPC market via their sponsorship of new recruits' law school fees.</p> <p>The desire to \"add value\" is also informing the LLM programmes being offered by traditional universities. For example, LLMs that combine law with a language, or allow students to study a different legal system, are becoming more popular \u2013 a symptom of an increasingly international legal market, where law firms place a premium on language skills and experience of other cultures.</p> <p>Options looked on favourably by employers include the two-year law and Chinese LLM launched last year by Edinburgh University, and a host of specialist European law LLMs offered by universities including Kings College London and Kent.</p> <p>Intriguingly, the Edinburgh LLM includes a spell \"at a prestigious Chinese University\", with students expected to graduate with a \"solid grounding in Chinese language.\" For those who don't fancy attempting to master a whole new alphabet, Queen Mary University of London's LLM in Paris \u2013 which focuses on exploring commercial law from both comparative and international perspectives, within a common law framework, but is taught in its entirety in the French capital \u2013 offers an alternative way to simultaneously pick up a new language and an additional legal qualification.</p> <p>Other innovative new LLMs include the broad range of part-time online courses offered by Northumbria University \u2013 enabling wannabe lawyers to work while they boost their CVs \u2013 and the specialist advocacy LLM launched this September by Strathclyde University, which is the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/dec/01/time-speak-up-oral-advocacy\" title=\"\">first of its kind in Britain</a>.</p> <p>Amid this array of options, some traditional LLM courses are still going strong, of course. Postgraduate legal qualifications from Cambridge or Oxford, in particular, remain highly regarded by law firms and chambers. What remains to be seen is whether students will still choose to do these courses before getting a training contract or pupillage under their belts.</p> <p><em>Alex Aldridge is the editor of <a href=\"http://www.legalcheek.com/\">Legal Cheek</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Over the last decade there has been a growth in 'portfolio careers' \u2013 a living derived from have multiple simultaneous jobs on a part-time, flexible, consulting or interim basis.</p> <p>Those juggling such careers cite the positives that derive from having exciting variety or the better work-life balance and greater flexibility afforded by being their own boss. What is not often mentioned is the constant strain of keeping all these plates spinning while securing the next piece of work; a magic trick some seem to achieve effortlessly while others toil and sweat.</p> <p>Often a useful way some portfolioists derive a more reliable income stream is by including one or two remunerated non-executive director (NED) positions. Such roles not only benefit them by providing a regular salary, but also help develop skills, profile and credibility in other lines of work.</p> <p>NEDs sit on the board of many public, private and not-for-profit organisations, working as a 'critical friend' scrutinising the organisation's performance and offering strategic input and advice to the executive team. How often they meet and what duties they are required to perform varies between organisations.</p> <p>NEDs can, however, expect at least a monthly commitment to attend meetings (having read the necessary board reports), plus further meetings if appointed to a sub-committee dealing with specific issues such as remuneration and finance. They may be required to be present at public events, such as an opening of a new building, and some boards also provide training and team development away-days that will require a time commitment (sometimes overnight).</p> <p>Janet Dean, for instance, runs a housing and regeneration consultancy, is chair of a drugs and alcohol abuse treatment service provider, deputy chair of governors for a university and NED of an NHS primary care trust. She aims for a mix of three days a week of interim project commitments with two days as an NED \u2013 a mix she admits is sometimes hard to achieve and maintain.</p> <p>The opportunity to connect with an organisation on a long-term basis as it develops and goes on a journey has made Janet appreciate the dynamics and tensions that can exist between boards and executive teams. This has benefited her interim project work because clients see her as someone who understands the strategic \u2013 not just operational \u2013 needs and can speak to all the key stakeholders.</p> <p>Breaking through into the non-executive world and achieving the first post can be tricky. Often people wanting to be NEDs face the experience/opportunity catch-22 that many first-time job seekers and graduates encounter \u2013 can't get a job because without the experience but can't get the experience without the job. Boards appointing new NEDs are often looking to find people that already have experience of how a board operates and know how a good NED can make a difference.</p> <p>A good way to start is to seek out quasi-board positions, such as sitting on strategic partnership teams above projects being delivered by organisations in joint-venture partnerships. This will give you experience of what it's like to offer strategic input and vision while not having direct executive responsibility for the project.</p> <p>You could also secure a non-remunerated NED role. These posts are usually found in public, not-for-profit or third sector organisations such social landlords, charities and community groups. They are a great way to get a foothold in the non-executive market and prove you have the skills to be an active board member.</p> <p>Many NEDs find that once they have that first board-level role under their belt, they can access further non-executive opportunities more easily. They are more firmly on the radar of organisations seeking new board members as well as other interim or portfolio work.</p> <p>Andy Brown, a former executive of The Burton Group, Boots, Sky TV and ASDA now acts as a business consultant while also being an NED for various companies and a member <a href=\"http://www.yorkshirecancerresearch.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Yorkshire Cancer Research's</a> board. \"There's no question that acting as an NED gives you a bit of extra credibility\", he said, and although, \"it seems to be quite tricky to get into the NED game in the first place, working with [organisations] at board level on strategy and other pretty sensitive things shows others you are useful have around\".</p> <p>Andy's advice for those seeking a first step into the world of NEDs is: \"in the first instance, be persistent and keep at it [and] once you are up and running \u2026 keep your different things separate \u2013 I use a number of web tools to keep my papers in the cloud and manage my time.\"</p> <p>It should also be noted that boards will sometimes seek out new members with certain skills and backgrounds that may be required by the organisation at that point in time. For instance, a non-executive board member with a finance background may be of more interest if there is an audit or executive salary review due. The NEDs won't be expected to roll their sleeves up and help deliver operational challenges but they will be expected to ask the right questions of the executive team to safeguard the health and performance of the organisation on behalf of its staff, stakeholders and customers.</p> <p>Taking on an NED role while also maintaining a portfolio career can be a tricky balancing act. Boards will have established and non-negotiable meeting dates, which you will be expected to commit to, and this can create tension when clients come calling with new or extra work. Many NEDs talk of the need to find a 'balance of commitment'. They are regularly tested by the dilemma of accepting another NED position that can provide a steady income, intellectual interest and a bit of kudos while also holding out for that next big (and possibly more lucrative) chunk of interim or project work that will require blood, sweat, tears. But if that balance can be achieved the benefits to a career portfolioist can be very rewarding.</p> <p><em>Robert Wright is a recruitment consultant for NRG Executive.

  "<p>A merger of BAE Systems and EADS could produce an arms company so big it would operate beyond the reach of the law, the author of a report on corruption in the defence industry has warned.</p> <p>\"This will be a huge defence company in Europe and there will be a concern that it will be above prosecution, almost like the banks,\" said Mark Pyman, director of the defence and security programme at <a href=\"http://www.transparency.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Transparency International UK</a>.</p> <p>He said that if the planned \u00a330bn merger went ahead, the company should set up an independent board to ensure it did not indulge in bribery and corruption.</p> <p>The warning adds another potential obstacle to the deal, which has already run into political headwinds as governments from Berlin to Washington argue about how and where the new company would be run.</p> <p>The British, German and French governments all have stakes in the companies' merger and the US administration is the biggest customer of BAE.</p> <p>Pyman was speaking prior to the launch of an unprecedented study looking at defence companies around the world and their attitudes towards corruption.</p> <p>Transparency International's first anti-corruption index shows that British and US firms have responded to past scandals by adopting a much more rigorous approach towards corruption than continental European firms, including EADS. There were significant differences between BAE and EADS in their approaches to transparency and disclosure, Pyman said.</p> <p>BAE came up at the top of band B in the index, while EADS only made band C. Neither EADS nor any French defence company agreed to supply internal company information to the compilers of the study, even on a confidential basis.</p> <p>\"If the merger goes ahead it is really important that the combined companies have anti-corruption systems at least equal to BAE's, and which really should be in band A,\" Pyman said.</p> <p>He spoke of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/05/bae-saudi-yamamah-deal-background\" title=\"BAE and the Saudis: How secret cash payments oiled 43bn arms deal\">BAE's slush fund for secret payments to Saudi dignitaries</a> in a contract initiated in the 1980s (which was exposed by the Guardian), the payments to foreign governments by the US company Lockheed Martin in the 1970s, and the 2003 bribery scandal involving Boeing employees over a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2004/jul/27/usnews.internationalnews\" title=\"US tanker \">contract for a new US air force tanker aircraft</a>. \"It is clear that scandals have had an immense effect on changing a company's behaviour.\"</p> <p>The TI study concludes that two-thirds of the world's biggest defence firms do not provide enough public evidence on how they fight corruption. It states: \"Defence corruption threatens everyone \u2013 taxpayers, soldiers, governments, companies. With huge contracts and high secrecy in the defence sector there are numerous opportunities to hide corruption away from public scrutiny.</p> <p>\"A company website is the best place for a company to tell the world exactly how it fights corruption.\"</p> <p>Pyman said: \"Corruption in defence is dangerous, divisive, wasteful. The cost is paid by everyone. Governments and taxpayers do not get value for their money and clean companies lose business to corrupt [ones]. Money wasted on defence corruption could be better spent.\"</p> <p>Lord Robertson, a former Nato secretary general, said: \"Companies must have a reputation for zero tolerance to corruption&#xa0;\u2026 a corruption scandal can wipe away decades spent building a reputation.\"</p> <p>The 10 British firms in the TI index are Babcock International Group, BAE Systems, Chemring Group, Cobham, GKN, Meggitt, QinetiQ Group, Rolls-Royce, Serco Group, and Ultra Electronics Holdings.</p> <p>BAE scored high band B ratings for both its public information on corruption and ethics (on websites, for example) and for its \"internal information\", the facts a firm might tell its staff about good practices.</p> <p>EADS, which is registered in the Netherlands, scored a low band C rating, and it declined to provide internal information in confidence to the TI study team that was led by Pyman. France, which has a significant stake in EADS, fares particularly badly. The report says: \"There is a strong need for French defence companies to be much more transparent in disclosing what they have in place by way of ethics and compliance systems.\"</p> <p>An EADS spokesperson said: \"We are committed to full compliance with the highest standards of integrity and transparency. We work continuously to cooperate with initiatives to raise those standards.\"</p> <p>The Association of French Aerospace Industries advised French defence companies to decline to provide TI with any internal information.</p> <p>\"It means that we are unable to provide any insight into whether these companies do have good internal systems,\" the report says.</p> <p>On the basis of available public information, the company Thales comes out relatively well, with a band B rating, but Dassault, manufacturer of Rafale aircraft, and which recently beat BAE's Eurofighter/Typhoon to a multibillion-pound deal with India, comes off badly, with a band E score.</p> <p>Only four companies \u2013 Fluor Corporation , Accenture, Hewlett-Packard and Britain's Serco Group \u2013 scored a grade A in \"risk management\", measuring how companies assess decisions to counter corrupt influences and use due diligence to curb corrupt behaviour by intermediaries.</p> <p>The TI report says it is surprising so few defence firms take corruption seriously since most countries must comply with international anti-corruption laws, such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the recent UK Bribery Act, which have extraterritorial reach.</p> <p>Transparency International is a charity set up to combat corruption and promote good practice in companies in all sectors, not only defence.</p> <h2>SFO investigates GPT</h2> <p>The Serious Fraud Office is conducting a criminal investigation into GPT Special Project Management, a British subsidiary of EADS. The investigation concerns payments and gifts allegedly given to Saudi generals.</p> <p>GPT sells communications equipment to the Saudi national guard via a government-to-government programme intimately involving the Ministry of Defence.</p> <p>The management of the \u00a32bn project, called Sangcom, has been monitored by an MoD team headed by a British general. Saudi payments to GPT go through an MoD bank account.</p> <p>Ian Foxley, a former colonel in the British army who blew the whistle on the project, has given detailed evidence to the SFO.</p> <p>He told the Guardian that fraud investigators should not be allowed to distinguish between individuals allegedly involved in wrongdoing, and the company which employed them. It had been too easy to let either individuals or firms off the hook.</p> <p>Under a memoranda of understanding with the Saudi Arabian government, the MoD places contracts with British contractors. Some MoD officials appear to have expressed concern about payments made to a Cayman Islands bank account by GPT as early as 2008, the Financial Times reported.</p>",
  "<p>To those of us who were there, and can remember it all too vividly, the 60s was a&#xa0;time when almost anything seemed possible. The chrysalis miraculously turned into the butterfly and flittered into space.</p> <p>This longed-for transformation from drabness into glamour is the theme of <em>Jerusalem the Golden</em>, my favourite of Margaret Drabble's early novels, and it is a recurring motif in Philip Norman's new biography of Mick Jagger, in which he charts in riveting detail Jagger's own transformation from a humdrum LSE student in striped college scarf and cardigan into the beautiful renegade and rock star, living symbol of that naive but in some ways rather wonderful 60s rebellious nonconformity.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/philip-norman\" title=\"\">Philip Norman is a former Sunday Times journalist who has written books</a> on the Beatles and John Lennon besides a group biography of the Rolling Stones. He views the Beatles and the Stones as \"one single epic story\", an intertwined narrative he has been telling and retelling for the past three decades. He brings to the subject a great depth of knowledge and a critical detachment that raises his writing way above the level of most rock band biography, usually a nightmare of unattributed anecdote and gush.</p> <p>He is particularly good on Jagger's early life. Mike, as he was then, was brought up in mundane respectability in a white pebble-dash house in Denver Road, Dartford. He watched <em>Muffin the Mule</em>. Yes, those were calmer childhoods. His genteel mother Eve, who was born in New South Wales, was an office secretary, then a beautician.</p> <p>Norman has a novelist's awareness of the oddities of human relationships, and Mick's father emerges as a fascinating figure. Basil Fanshawe Jagger was a high-minded disciplinarian, an athlete and a sportsman whose passion was basketball. He taught PE, then held a lowly post in recreational sports administration. Basil Jagger was a deeply conventional man whose gallantry to women, Norman argues, descended to his son in the fitful moods of protectiveness and kindness that were to punctuate the younger Jagger's history of droit de seigneurism and his less-than-charming habit of denying paternity suits.</p> <p>In 1961, Mike Jagger left Dartford Grammar School and enrolled at the London School of Economics to read for a BSc. He had lost his virginity to a nurse in a store cupboard at the local Bexley psychiatric hospital where he had been working as a temporary porter. Mike would soon be transforming into Mick.</p> <p>London itself was emerging from its postwar frowsiness. Norman tells us: \"A feeling of excitement and expectation pulsed through the crusty old Victorian metropolis at every level.\" Norman is not above a clich\u00e9. But his grasp of the sudden change of atmosphere in which Town and Queen magazines began to flourish and girls started to parade down Kings Road in V-neck sweaters, black stockings and short skirts will strike those who remember those days of sudden exhilarating novelty as absolutely accurate. Coffee bars and blues band music were a part of it, and Mick's first performance with the Rolling Stones took place at the Marquee on 12 July 1962.</p> <p>The book brings out well a key aspect of the period: the close relationship between rock music and the art schools, breeding ground of anarchy and protest in the 60s. Jagger and Keith Richards had gone to the same primary school. By the time they met again the future star guitarist was at Sidcup Art College. John Lennon, Pete Townshend, Eric Clapton and Syd Barrett followed the same route. It wasn't just the music of the Rolling Stones, what Norman describes as the \"dishevelled slightly off-register sound\" of their first No 1 single \"It's All Over Now\". It was the look of them, the volatile and taunting aspect of performance. This was rock music transformed into theatre art.</p> <p>The most intriguing character appearing at this period is Andrew Loog Oldham, seen by Norman as the Rolling Stones' Svengali, a strawberry blond 19-year-old who had started his career as an odd job man in Mary Quant's boutique Bazaar. It was Oldham who, as their first manager, marketed the Rolling Stones as anti-Beatles, bad boys in contrast to the mothers' pets with pudding-basin haircuts. I remember the impact of Jagger's 1967 solo composition \"Let's Spend the Night Together\", replete with heavy breathing.</p> <p>By the mid-60s the drug culture was rampant. Norman provides a conscientiously credible account of the 1967 Redlands drug bust, though in some ways I prefer the more ebullient and ramshackle version of this famous episode given in Richards's recent autobiography, <em>Life</em>. Both versions, incidentally, deny the Mars bar story.</p> <p>The arrest and brief imprisonment of Jagger on drugs charges ended in high farce with the establishment frenziedly kowtowing to the youth cult. First William Rees-Mogg's pro-Jagger editorial in the Times, with its headline taken from Alexander Pope, \"Who breaks a butterfly on a wheel?\" Next the <em>World in Action</em> confrontation in an Essex garden between four besuited establishment grandees and Jagger, flown in like a young god by helicopter. The sycophancy of the scene will be etched in the memory of all of us who watched it in excruciating detail on our primitive black and white TVs. Norman finds evidence of overtures made to Jagger by Harold Wilson's government in 1968 suggesting he should stand for parliament. For England as a serious country, all this surely signified the beginning of the end.</p> <p>For the young he was a subversively Romantic figure. In a Byron exhibition I curated for the National Portrait Gallery I suggested that Jagger was a 20th-century Byron. Some people felt this was going a bit far. But you only have to replay the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2011/jul/06/rolling-stones-hyde-park-1969-video\" title=\"\">footage of <em>The Stones in the Park</em></a>, the rock concert held in Hyde Park in 1969, to see the obvious parallels. Not just the blubber lips and Byronic ruffled shirt. Not just Jagger's recitation of Shelley's \"Adona\u00efs\" in memory of Brian Jones, who had drowned two days before the concert. It's the crowd reaction that makes one think of Byron, girls climbing up the platform for the ecstasy of touching him. Like Byron in his period, Jagger was the focus of hysterical sexual fantasy.</p> <p>He'd become one of the beautiful people, the sophisticates, appearing in Roy Strong's diary (from which Norman should have quoted) at a Cecil Beaton party: \"Once again this was a costume parade on the grand scale: Peter Ayer the actor, in brown velvet, Ossie Clark in plum velvet edged with ribbon, his wife Celia Birtwell tousled and pretty in black \u2026 Patrick Lichfield all hair and embroidered shirt, Mick Jagger in purple, and Penelope Tree wearing an astonishing leather hat whose brim went halfway down her back.\" Strong himself, emerging from a similarly drab and disadvantaged London suburban background, was on the same fast-track reinvention course as Jagger's, turning himself into the kingmaker of taste.</p> <p>By 1970, when I interviewed Lennon, the Beatles had disbanded. He and a rather surly Yoko Ono had a lot to tell me about their wish from now on to \"live in paper bags\". He suggested the Stones should follow suit and find themselves more mature, more spiritually rewarding occupations. But how could this be possible? Mick lived for the performance in a sense that the Beatles, primarily songwriters, did not. In effect the Stones filled the vacuum left by the Beatles. Their <em>Sticky Fingers</em> album, with its Andy Warhol cover, was, as Norman tells us, \"a landslide victory\".</p> <p>It has to be said that the second half of this biography flags and becomes just a little repetitious. There is too much about Jagger mingling with the aristocrats, too many scenes of drug-taking, too much of both together, as when Marianne Faithfull at a banquet given by the Earl of Warwick \"took five Mandrax tablets by way of hors d'oeuvres and passed out into her soup\". But what the book does establish, in spite of the commotion there has always been around him, is Jagger's remarkable consistency both as a performer (still singing \"Satisfaction\") and major countercultural influence.</p> <p>\u2022 Fiona MacCarthy's <em>The Last Pre-Raphaelite: Edward Burne-Jones and the Victorian Imagination</em> won the 2012 James Tait Black prize for biography.</p>",
  "<p>It was Monday 31 March 1981, coming up to 2.30pm, and John Hinckley was fidgeting by the Florida Avenue entrance of the Washington Hilton, catching the attention of a police lieutenant who stopped to stare over at him. Hinckley jostled with reporters too, complaining that the press were always getting in the way, before finding a place to stand among the TV cameras. It drizzled, off and on, and the sidewalk was damp. His speech inside finished, President Reagan came out of the hotel, flanked by security men, acknowledging the few onlookers across the street and the small crowd of pressmen on the sidewalk beside him. For a moment, Hinckley asked himself the question: \"Should I do this or not?\" A journalist shouted to the president, and as he stood by the waiting limousine, Reagan raised his arm to wave. It was then that Hinckley, the assassin, crouched and fired \u2013 six shots flashing out in a couple of seconds. He was no more than 10ft from the president. Reagan heard what sounded like a \"small fluttering sound, pop, pop, pop\", looked suddenly serious, as though unable to believe what was happening, and then sagged; in that moment he was bundled into the car by Jerry Parr, one of his secret service agents; as they bent down to get inside one of the bullets ricocheted off the limousine and struck the president under his arm. The shot felt like an \"unbelievably painful\" blow in his upper back; Reagan didn't yet know that he'd been shot, but thought the pain had come from Parr falling on to him, so as to cover him from further shots. In the same flurry of bullets, three others were injured. The gunman kept squeezing the trigger, even though the barrels were empty. The news cameras recorded everything; within half an hour all the major networks were running film of the shooting.</p> <p>Unlike most assassins from the French revolution to the 1960s, Hinckley was not a political extremist or a misguided idealist, but a film fan; he was not motivated by partisan contempt but by a celluloid-inspired yearning. He shot Reagan not because he hated the president, but because he adored a movie star. By assassinating Reagan, he hoped to fuse a mystical union with Jodie Foster, the act being an attempt to link their names forever. He wanted to claim her attention, but more than that to traumatise her. In a sense, Foster was the target he shot at, Foster the person he planned to assassinate. Shooting Reagan was a vicious approach to her, its aim to shock her out of her distance and her stardom, and to barge into the sacred aura of her fame. He had been stalking Foster for months, hounding her with letters and phonecalls that tinged romance with fury. If he had failed to fire at Reagan, he had planned to travel on to Yale University, where Foster was then a student, and either simply commit suicide or kill first her and then himself.</p> <p>Hinckley remarked of the shooting: \"I felt like I was walking into a movie.\" The movie he had walked into was undoubtedly Martin Scorsese's New York neo-noir nightmare, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/36313/taxi.driver\" title=\"\"><em>Taxi Driver</em></a> (1976). This film obsessed Hinckley (during its first release, he watched it at least 15 times), and he imagined himself to be identical to its isolated hero and would-be assassin, Travis Bickle (played by Robert De Niro). Part&#xa0;of that identification meant his desperately falling for Foster in her role as the teenage prostitute, Iris. A college drop-out and failed pop star, Hinkley, by consciously playing out a movie character, endowed himself with some&#xa0;purpose and discovered some meaning in his own life, doubled as it was with the life that Bickle had led up on the screen.</p> <p>Many commentators pointed out the discrepancy between virile, attractive De Niro and plump, gawky, besuited Hinckley. If a battle between youth and age had underlain the revolutionary spirit of the Vietnam years, then the new American assassin (such as Mark Chapman, the killer of John Lennon) was someone young, who by his very \"squareness\", his inability to be hip, resembled the grown-up \"straight world\". Yet Hinckley's social awkwardness, his lack of style, did indeed resonate with Bickle's position outside the world of cool. Bickle was partly modelled on the decidedly un-trendy Arthur Bremer, the would-be assassin of the racist presidential candidate, George Wallace. So it is that in <em>Taxi Driver</em>, it's the pimps and the prostitutes who are fashionable; Bickle could stand for the failure of many to adapt themselves to the essentially Californian \"beautiful people\" ideal that dominated American film, fashion and music in the 70s. Hinckley had tried to fit into the LA music scene; when that failed, he fell back on being Travis&#xa0;Bickle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397155083\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349274163941/Still-from-ZABRISKIE-POIN-007.jpg\" alt=\"Still from ZABRISKIE POINT\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin in<em> Zabriskie Point</em>. Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/MGM</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/MGM</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The story of American assassination effectively begins with the murder of Abraham Lincoln, a president shot by a second-rate actor in a theatre in revenge for a defeat in a terrible war. Hinckley's ludicrous attempt indicates that story's decline, with Reagan, a president who had been a Hollywood actor shot simply to impress an actress. All political meaning had emptied from the crime; there was simply a mad, unrequited love affair with an image.</p> <p>On the night of Reagan's shooting, the FBI interviewed Paul Schrader, the writer of <em>Taxi Driver</em>. In time the film itself would become an exhibit at Hinckley's trial. Schrader remained clear that Hinckley's misuse of the movie should be no grounds for censorship. Such men were simply mad, and even the most innocuous of images could stimulate their fantasies. He pointed out that the apparently innocent Coppertone ad, showing a small dog tugging at a young girl's bikini bottom, was a picture beloved by paedophiles. And yet there was something more complex and less innocent at work in <em>Taxi Driver</em>. Scorsese had hoped that his movie's violence would shock the audience out of their connection to De Niro's character. Instead they plainly loved and welcomed the film's lurch towards mayhem; they turned out not to want exorcism, but performance. The exhilaration of violence was everything; they were electrified, not sobered. Moreoever Scorsese, Schrader and De Niro all likewise understood and to some extent shared Bickle's rage and loneliness. In taking on the figure of the alienated assassin, they found much in him that resembled themselves; both the film's makers and its audience were horrified and sympathetic, repelled and complicit.</p> <p>The grey area that <em>Taxi Driver</em> inhabits has always been the zone in which assassins appear in film. There are two clear traditions for representing such killers; in both cases, the power of the films involved depends on a moral ambiguity that lets us identify with the assassin even as we question them. First of all, in American film, from the Danny Kaye comedy <em>The Court Jester</em> (1955) to Alan J Pakula's paranoid thriller <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/79377/parallax-view\"><em>The Parallax View</em></a> (1974), we can trace the development of an unexpected character \u2013 the accidental assassin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397155084\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349274407716/Still-from-THE-PARALLAX-V-008.jpg\" alt=\"Still from THE PARALLAX VIEW\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Warren Beatty in Alan J Pakula's <em>The Parallax View</em>. Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/PARAMOUNT</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/PARAMOUNT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such figures commit assassination by mistake, or are condemned as assassins when they are innocent or, most strongly, have been brainwashed into becoming killers. Alfred Hitchcock's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/35095/north-by-northwest\" title=\"\"><em>North By Northwest</em></a> (1959) presents an intermediate version of the motif. Roger Thornhill, played by Cary Grant, is mistaken for a fictitious government agent and wrongly believed to have assassinated a high-ranking US diplomat right in the United Nations building. As often in Hitchcock's work, an assumed guilt plunges his star into adventure \u2013 nearly killed with a bottle of bourbon and a Mercedes, falling for a glamorous blonde on a train, shot at on the dusty Illinois cornfields by a plane, trapped in a Chicago auction-house, and pursued across the monument at Mount Rushmore. Through it all, his well-tailored grey suit is battered, bespattered, but always ready to be ironed and pressed. It's the symbol of his resilient urbanity, but also the uniform that the film tells us he must discard.</p> <p>For all its Technicolor glamour, the film conveys national self-doubt. Popular psychological and sociological works of the 1940s and 50s lamented the decline of American vigour. Having told the nation <em>How To Win Friends and Influence People</em> (1937), Dale Carnegie's newest book informed us <em>How To Stop Worrying and Start Living</em> (1948). It was precisely the capacity for spontaneous life that seemed in peril. America's nemesis was \"the man in the grey flannel suit\", the \"white collar\" worker, the \"organisation man\", the \"other-directed\" member of David Riesman's influential treatise, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lonely_Crowd\" title=\"\"><em>The Lonely Crowd</em></a> (1950). The villain of modern life was the middle class. The new suburbs spread out, the old traditions were gone and novel conformities improvised there, a new orthodoxy for the quietly desperate. Of course, there was nothing new in believing the nation was ruined. The jeremiad, that doleful diagnosis of the contemporary world, was a long-standing American genre. It was the focus of the sociologists' and psychologists' attack that was new. Now the great sin was sameness.</p> <p>It was central to the concept of the \"accidental assassin\" that it was the ordinary man who was guilty. Indeed his ordinariness was the source of the guilt. By being believed to be an assassin, Thornhill finds a route out of the facelessness of modern American life. He gets noticed; he is in the frame.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397155085\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349274535818/Still-from-THE-MANCHURIAN-008.jpg\" alt=\"Still from THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frank Sinatra and Laurence Harvey in The Manchurian Candidate. Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/United Artists</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/United Artists</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>John Frankenheimer's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/102424/manchurian.candidate\" title=\"\"><em>The Manchurian Candidate</em></a> (1962) took the scheme of the accidental assassin one stage further, namely in the direction of chaos and hysteria. The film shows a group of captured American soldiers brainwashed by the communist enemy, with one of their number (played by Laurence Harvey) conditioned into becoming the perfect assassin.</p> <p>It was the Moscow show-trials of the 1930s and more recently the Korean war that introduced the world to the practice of \"brainwashing\". The term derived from the Chinese expression, <em>hsi nao</em>, (literally \"wash brain\") and was imported into the west by the American journalist and cold warrior, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hunter_(U.S._journalist)\" title=\"\">Edward Hunter</a>. In the late 1940s, Hunter had been scandalised by a Soviet film in which a human being was induced to share the same automatic reactions which Pavlov had evoked in dogs. To Hunter, and soon to others, it would seem that the communists were reducing human beings to the bestial. These fears were realised as Americans learnt of the effects of psychological and physical torture on allied prisoners of war and other \"enemies of the people\" in Korea. Before directing <em>The Manchurian Candidate</em>, Frankenheimer read as many books on brainwashing as possible; he was naturally interested in its military uses, but also firmly believed that on the broader social level all Americans were being brainwashed.</p> <p>It appeared as though \"mass psychoanalysis\" was eroding the heart's privacy, that secret self shown to be just another carbon-copy of your neighbour's secrets. Many suspected that modern advertising and marketing borrowed brainwashing techniques. The individual was being \"got at\" by corporations and politicians. Books such as Vance Packard's influential study of psychological manipulation in advertising, <em>The Hidden Persuaders</em> (1957) exemplified the new anxiety. (It's worth remembering that in <em>North By Northwest</em>, Cary Grant played a Madison Avenue advertising man.) Consent could be engineered.</p> <p>The essence of humanity was in question. In <em>The Hidden Persuaders</em>, Packard headed one chapter \"The Packaged Soul\"; in two separate broadcasts for the BBC, in March 1947, RH&#xa0;Stevens talked on \"The Spirit in the Cage\", and in January 1953, AH Farrar-Hockley, who had himself been a captive in Korean prison-camps, spoke of \"The Spirit in Jeopardy\". The liberty of the individual soul was being challenged.</p> <p>The automatic assassin was one free of responsibility. He was an entirely emptied individual, merely an instrument. Drained of will, character dies. The Manchurian candidate's crimes are not his own; he does what he is told. In a few years, this obedience would look in the eyes of the \"counterculture\" as a fitting symbol for the mind-control they imagined to be work in the culture at large: their educations, the books they had read, the TV they had watched. Particularly, it looked like another form of the obedience that led soldiers to kill in warfare, playing the power games of \"the military-industrial complex\".</p> <p>The accidental assassin theme resonated in the post-Kennedy era. What was different about Kennedy's assassination was that no one could make sense of it. Rather than understanding, there was suspicion; rather than certainty, there was only the event itself, replayed over and over, as in Oliver Stone's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/77907/jfk\" title=\"\"><em>JFK</em></a> (1991). So it was that the deed had to be replayed as a paranoid narrative; the assumption being that there must be a conspiracy behind appearances that makes them make sense.</p> <p>Michelangelo Antonioni's <em>Zabriskie Point</em> (1970) was in effect a remaking of the \"accidental assassin\" theme as worked out by Hitchcock. But it was <em>The Parallax View</em> that most thoroughly set out the issues at stake. A journalist, Joe Frady (played by Warren Beatty) witnesses the assassination of a senator, and afterwards tries to connect the murder to the enigmatic Parallax Corporation. Frady believes that they are hiring and training assassins, but in fact they are tracking down stool-pigeons, finding violent sociopaths who can be conveniently scapegoated as the conventional mad assassin, while the real killer gets away with it. As Lee Harvey Oswald would put it, they're just \"the patsy\". And the audience is just another \"patsy\"; we too take the psychological test that Frady undergoes in his attempt to be accepted by the corporation. Like him, we are required to ask the question: are we potential killers?</p> <p>Besides these dark intimations, the other major kind of assassination film has the roughed-out morality of a cartoon. In a report of perhaps doubtful authenticity in the Sun, the pop-star Rihanna mused about the possibility of an acting career: \"I'd love to be an assassin. Either that or a lesbian. Maybe both. Hey, a gay assassin, there's nothing hotter than that.\" In its own way, her quote was tapping into a long-established outlaw chic. Assassins were sometimes cool because they were so cold, like the calculating murderer in Fred Zinnemann's 1973 film adaptation of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jun/03/day-jackal-frederick-forsyth\" title=\"\">Frederick Forsyth's thriller <em>The Day of the Jackal</em></a>. Otherwise assassins were viciously lovable \"hitmen\", hip because guns were hip; this taste for extremity and posing can be found at their strongest in a movie like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/apr/14/luc-besson-interview\" title=\"\">Luc Besson</a>'s <em>La Femme Nikita</em> (1990) or George Armitage's <em>Grosse Pointe Blank</em> (1997). The photogenic qualities of the assassin soothed most of our moral concerns. In their implicit praise of action as such, these films echoed the origins of modern assassination, that had seen the crime as \"propaganda by the deed\", a pure act that transcended language, and offered the doer the redemption of immediacy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397155086\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349274992256/Still-from-THE-CONFORMIST-008.jpg\" alt=\"Still from THE CONFORMIST\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From Bernardo Bertolucci's <em>The Conformist</em>. Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Maran Film</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Maran Film</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet other films had already dismantled the assassin's murderous \"cool\". In Andrzej Wajda's <em>Ashes and Diamonds</em> (1958), Zbigniew Cybulski, the Polish James Dean in dark sunglasses, plays the assassin as youthful rebel, impulsive, womanising and apparently affectless. Yet in the end, he hesitates to go through with the assassination he has prepared; though he ends up by killing his man, the murder stands revealed as a pointless sacrifice. Set at the very end of the second world war, the film expresses a revulsion with violence, a longing instead for ordinary affection. Otherwise in Bernardo Bertolucci's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/feb/22/bertolucci-the-conformist\" title=\"\"><em>The Conformist</em></a> (1970), style is a form of emptiness; here Jean-Louis Trintignant plays a would-be assassin who wants to suppress difference in himself, to act as though he were a Manchurian candidate. In a murderous society, such as fascist Italy, to want to become a murderer assumes the guise of an act of willed compliance. Assassination does not rebel against conformity, it confirms it.</p> <p>To my knowledge, there hasn't yet been a film about Hinckley's attack on the president. However, it can only be a matter of time. (Could Jodie Foster be cast as Nancy Reagan?) When it finally comes, it will only be the latest in a line of movies that have replayed the dark history of American assassination: from John Wilkes Booth slaying Abraham Lincoln at the centre of DW&#xa0;Griffith's <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> (1915), through David Miller's <em>Executive Action</em> (1973) to Spike Lee's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/80882/malcolm-x\" title=\"\"><em>Malcolm X</em> </a>(1992) or Emilio Estevez's <em>Bobby</em> (2006). Hinckley's attempt to be the new John Wilkes Booth had meant replaying <em>Taxi Driver</em>, which had in a sense replayed Arthur Bremer, who followed Sirhan Sirhan, Robert Kennedy's killer, who has represented himself before parole boards as a kind of Manchurian Candidate, and so on, back through an infinite regress of mirrors. In such films, history gets rerun as an image, and so doubles our nagging worry that, in the minds of the assassins, an image is perhaps all an assassination ever&#xa0;was.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"www.amnesty.org.uk/youngreporter\">Amnesty Young Human Rights Reporter</a> competition challenges students aged seven to 18 to put the world to rights and produce a powerful piece of human rights journalism. This year there is a new photojournalism category for those who prefer to tell their story with images.</p> <p>The 2012 competition attracted more than 3,000 entries. What impact did entering have on the schools? How much work was it to enter? We asked five teachers whose pupils were top in their age category of the Young Human Rights Reporter competition 2012 to share their experiences and tips for teachers entering this year.</p> <h2>Marisa McNulty teaches modern studies and sociology at <a href=\"http://www.st-andrews.renfrewshire.sch.uk/a.html\">St Andrew's Academy</a>, Paisley.

It really takes very little of your time and has a big effect. I just mentioned the competition to Ciara's class quite last minute and Ciara came up with this really powerful article on child soldiers. To teachers, I'd say tell as many pupils as possible and show them a few examples of <a href=\"http://teachers.guardian.co.uk/teacher-resources/10777/?INTCMP=NECJOBBTN767I2\">past winners and runners up</a>. To pupils I'd say don't be shy of slightly more unusual topics.</p> <p>Getting involved in the competition, finding out more about human rights and maybe forming a school <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=11670\">Amnesty group</a> makes a real positive difference to your school. Our group makes an incredible contribution to school life. Through this kind of work our students get a sense that they are contributing to society. Sometimes it's difficult for young people to look up and see the bigger picture so this is a vital lesson for them, to find out that they can be part of change.</p> <h2>Sajeela Shah teaches religious studies at <a href=\"http://www.bentonpark.org.uk/secondary\">Benton Park</a> school in Leeds. Her pupil Fran Talbot was in the top three for the lower secondary age category of the competition with her article on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/may/14/human-rights-lower-secondary-award1\">Writing for human rights</a></h2> <p>When I announced the competition in class last year everyone let out a collective sigh, the general view was that no one from Leeds could ever do well in a national competition like this. I told them they should be proud of where they come from and that whatever your background you can achieve your ambitions with hard work and self belief. I read out one of the <a href=\"http://teachers.guardian.co.uk/teacher-resources/5564/Amnesty-International-Young-Human-Rights-reporter-competition-winners-2011\">2011 winning articles by Angus Kirk</a> \u2013 and explained that they had to write about something they were passionate about and highlight something others weren't aware of. I set the competition as homework and the whole class submitted an entry to me.</p> <p>Since Fran made the top three in the competition, she's become a role model in the school and things have snowballed for her. She has even blogged for the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/jul/17/blogpost-scholos-religion-leeds\">Guardian</a>. Now she wants to be a journalist and she's not afraid to express her views and say what she thinks.</p> <p>We are setting up an <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=11670\">Amnesty group</a> at school and getting even more involved in human rights. This year I'm excited about the new photojournalism category. I often use powerful images as a starter for my lessons, for example <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kevin-Carter-Child-Vulture-Sudan.jpg\">Kevin Carter's vulture in Sudan</a> so I know the impact images can have.</p> <h2><strong>Rose Murphy teaches at <a href=\"http://webfronter.com/enfield/stgeorges/\">St George's Catholic</a> school in Enfield.

Our pupils show real interest and compassion for the human rights issues we cover and have found the competition exciting and motivating. We are a Catholic school and social justice is very important in our faith. Boys, especially, enjoy the competitive nature of entering a competition. I was really pleased that one of our boys was a finalist for 2012.</p> <p>My advice to primary school teachers who want to enter is to give help and direction with the research. I start with a lesson where I have chosen an issue for them to investigate, it needs to be one that young children can relate to. In class, we discuss the background and a bit about the country and its people. I show a video on the subject and find a couple of examples of good reports. We discuss the structure and the balance of facts and reactions or emotions in the piece. The Guardian Teacher Network has some <a href=\"http://teachers.guardian.co.uk/resources.aspx?q=yhrr2013\">helpful guidelines</a> on human rights to help.</p> <p>I've found older pupils often write wonderful pieces from their own experience or having done independent research but for most of our pupils this more structured approach works best. Although, this year, our finalist Emmet chose his own topic and did his own research with his parents supervising, as his subject was the death penalty.</p> <h2>Chris Dennett is lead teacher in humanities at <a href=\"http://frog.paget.staffs.sch.uk/index.phtml?d=283897\">Paget High School</a> in Burton On Trent. His pupil Georgia Gilholy was runner up in the lower secondary category with her <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/may/14/human-rights-lower-secondary-award\">article on child brides</a></h2> <p>When we heard about the Young Human Rights Reporter of the Year competition last year we instantly thought that this was the perfect competition for us to enter. We already cover human rights in detail and saw an opportunity for our students to study human rights in even more depth as an extracurricular activity. We opened the competition to all of our KS3 students and had a whole day where we devoted all of our KS3 humanities lessons to human rights and the Amnesty competition. I'd say try to have at least a full day where you are able to really get to grips with human rights and the work of Amnesty.</p> <p>We studied a range of key issues throughout the day then invited our students to enter a piece on one of the issues or another of their choosing. Encourage students to select whatever topic they feel is the most important to write about and above all get students enthusiastic about trying to make a difference. We'll definitely be entering again next year, the competition was a huge success and is still spoken about by both students and staff even a year on. This year we are attempting to have some humanities ambassadors at school and hope the competition will inspire our students to take part in this.</p> <h2>Mark Woodward is head of careers and press officer at <a href=\"http://www.bablake.com/\">Bablake secondary school</a>. His student Beth Rowland was in the top three sixth form entries with her <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/may/14/human-rights-sixth-form-award1\">article on Tasers</a> and a pupil at Bablake primary school Lorna Williams was one of the top primary entries with her piece on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/may/14/human-rights-primary-school-award1\">plight of the homeless</a></h2> <p>We put a big emphasis on encouraging students to care for each other, the wider community and internationally. I'm always looking out for opportunities for our students. So last year I told all my students about the competition and put it in our daily bulletin.</p> <p>There's nothing like somebody from the outside world recognising what you do when you're at school; it's a great confidence boost and these little things stand out on a pupil's UCAS form and for going out into the world of work. Getting that recognition has a big impact on a school. Students and teachers can feel a bit trapped in school sometimes, so it was really inspiring to come to the Amnesty buildings, breaking away from school is a vital experience. My advice to fellow teachers thinking about entering the competition is let the students choose their own topics or their writing and research won't feel natural. They need to write about something they feel passionate about. For older pupils the most important thing a teacher can do is remind them about the deadlines.</p> <p><strong>You can find some really useful resources to help your pupils enter the competition on the <a href=\"http://teachers.guardian.co.uk/resources.aspx?q=yhrr2013\">Guardian Teacher Network</a>.</strong></p> <p><strong>To enter the Amnesty Young Human Rights Reporter of the Year competition and find out more <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=12085\">here</a> - the deadline for entry is 18 February 2013.</strong></p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

But he emphasised that there was scant prospect of Nato military intervention in Syria.</p> <p>\"Syria is a very, very complex society,\" he said. \"Foreign military interventions could have broader impacts.\"</p> <p>The statement issued after Nato's meeting in Brussels demanded an immediate halt to \"aggressive acts\" against Turkey.</p> <p>The shelling from Syria \"constitutes a cause of greatest concern for, and is strongly condemned by, all allies\", Nato ambassadors said in a statement, after they held a rare late-night meeting at Turkey's request to discuss the incident.</p> <p>\"The alliance continues to stand by Turkey and demands the immediate cessation of such aggressive acts against an ally, and urges the Syrian regime to put an end to flagrant violations of international law,\" the statement said.</p> <p>In Washington, the Pentagon strongly condemned Syria's deadly mortar strike into Turkey and said it was closely monitoring the situation.</p> <p>\"This is yet another example of the depraved behaviour of the Syrian regime, and why it must go. We regret the loss of life in Turkey, a strong ally,\" Pentagon spokesman George Little said.</p> <p>The White House also issued a strong statement condemning the incident and called for the Assad regime to step aside. \"All responsible nations must make clear that it is long past time for Assad to step aside, declare a ceasefire and begin the long-overdue political transition process,\" White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397196738\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/4/1349367966724/Turkey-map-001.jpg\" alt=\"Turkey map\" width=\"460\" height=\"476\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turkey map Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p>It's a great day today for one of those enlightened projects - the Open University is a particularly good example, or the BBC - which the UK sometimes conceives imaginatively and brings to fruition with brio.</p> <p>By the end of the afternoon, the last 54 artworks in a huge stash of more than 210,000 oil paintings in public ownership will have been photographed by technical experts and prepared for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/yourpaintings\">uploading online.</a></p> <p>They are a eclectic collection belonging to the <a href=\"http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/\">National Football Museum</a>, typical in their variety of the mixture which characterises most art in public hands. I remember reviewing one of the earliest volumes \u2013 a book as well as an online display \u2013 created by the organising <a href=\"http://www.thepcf.org.uk/\">Public Catalogue Foundation</a>, of the paintings here in Leeds. They ranged from valuable work by famous artists to a couple of amateur studies of trams on the walls of Beeston branch library.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397139574\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349302699364/game.jpg\" alt=\"beautiful game\" width=\"140\" height=\"178\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Beautiful Game by Michael J Browne - one of the 54 paintings being photographed today.

A much more flamboyant oil, painted as recently as 1997 by Michael J Browne and called<em> The Beautiful Game</em>, shows Eric Cantona, Fergie and other Manchester United stars in Renaissance style, based on Piero della Francesca's <em>Resurrection</em>. </p> <p>Unusually, this was painted in public at a bar in Castlefields in Manchester, with Cantona modelling for it. The French star later bought the painting and has loaned it to the museum.</p> <p>This wealth of background information is going online along with high quality images of the paintings; 172,000 are already up here and the whole collection, by more than 45,000 artists, is due to be available free by mid-December. The places where they hang or lie in storage are equally fascinating: not just the predictable galleries and town halls but a fire station, several police stations and a lighthouse.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_KpyPzMW4_I?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_KpyPzMW4_I?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>This heroic work by the Public Catalogue Foundation, working with the BBC, was the brainchild of Dr Fred Hohler, a farmer and landowner who previously worked as a diplomat and banker. His father taught for many years at the <a href=\"http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/\">Courtauld Institute of Art </a>and he was inspired to attempt his extraordinary project after visiting the <a href=\"http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/\">Fitzwilliam Museum</a> in Cambridge and later his local museum in Maidstone, Kent, and discovering that neither had a catalogue.</p> <p>He told <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/charlessaumarezsmith\">Charles Saumarez-Smith</a> in <a href=\"http://www.apollo-magazine.com/register/?articleUrl=%2Ffeatures%2F7742848%2Fthe-nations-art-revealed.thtml\">an interview</a> for <em>Apollo </em>magazine in April: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The ambition of the Foundation \u2013 for me at any rate \u2013 has been to try to demonstrate to the owners of these collections that they are valuable assets that can, with thought and good management, be used not just to make the lives of their citizens happier and more fulfilled, but also to develop enduring economic activity for the profit of their communities,' he says. 'Holding vast amounts of fine art in stores, leaving it up to fewer and fewer curators with less and less funding and diminishing relevant training to choose ever smaller numbers of works to put on show in their galleries, swiftly turns these assets into liabilities. Worse, it serves to limit public access to an ever-narrowing cultural experience.</p> </blockquote> <p>Less than 15 percent of the \u00a36 million raised to pay for the project has come from public funds, but public figures are eager to praise it. The culture secretary Ed Vaizey says:</p> <blockquote> <p>The inclusion of the National Football Museum's 54 paintings marks the completion of an ambitious project that is a world first. Never before has an entire nation's oil paintings been made available online and this tremendous achievement means that our incredible collection of more than 200,000 works will be more accessible to everyone than ever before.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>The National Football Museum's own Kevin Moore adds his own tribute: </p> <blockquote> <p>This is a fantastic project and something we're very excited to be a part of. The oil paintings are key pieces within the museum and this is a wonderful way to open up our collection to a much wider audience; we're really proud to have them included in the first ever, online catalogue of its kind.</p> </blockquote> <p>Dr Hohler is happy and satisfied and full of praise for Andy Ellis, the director of the foundation, who has headed its operations from the start. He says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Completing the photography takes us within an inch of completing the original PCF project. This is a huge achievement for the small dedicated team behind the Foundation, led throughout by Andy Ellis. Making public the 210,000 paintings in public ownership gives a new meaning to the concept of public access. It is an enormous public benefaction, which now needs to be maintained and sustained into the future.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>You can see the paintings <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/yourpaintings\">already online here</a> and a Guardian <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/gallery/2012/sep/30/uk-art-collection-in-pictures?newsfeed=true\">picture gallery here.</a> A smaller regional equivalent, Yorkshire's Favourite Paintings, was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2011/aug/08/yorkshire-s-favourite-paintings-leeds-city-art-gallery-terry-frost-ivon-hitchens\">highlighted in the Northerner last year</a> and is well worth surfing.</em></p>",
  "<p>Carillion, the outsourcing giant, has been accused of racial discrimination by Asian-origin hospital workers who claim they were told by white managers to give gold watches, bangles and cash in exchange for favours.</p> <p>Forty eight staff of Goan origin said in employment tribunal papers that they were subjected to a culture of intimidation and fear by supervisors at the Great Western Hospital in Swindon, Wiltshire.</p> <p>One particularly disturbing aspect of this, it is alleged, was the practice of managers to demand \"gifts\" from non-white staff including cash, jewellery, cigarettes, alcohol and, in one instance, a duvet.</p> <p>In return, staff would be granted holiday and overtime requests, allowing them to return to Goa to visit family members or attend religious festivals, it is claimed.</p> <p>When staff complained of the practice as early as 2007, they faced harassment for trade union membership and whistle-blowing, it is claimed.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Carillion said that there were incidents of gift giving for favours from managers, but added that these have been investigated thoroughly and disciplinary procedures are in place. The company will vigorously defend itself against the claims.</p> <p>Carillion is one of the UK's leading companies in providing support services to local and central government through a variety of Public and Private Partnership projects. In a 2012 interim report, entitled 'Making Tomorrow a Better Place', the company's revenue is listed as \u00a32.2bn with underlying profit before taxation amounting to \u00a373.1m.</p> <p>Jose Estrocio, a claimant and GMB union representative, said that the tribunal cases follow years of intimidation and complaints.</p> <p>\"We are in a developed country and had to give money and gold for holidays. None of the white cleaners had to do this, it was only the Goan community.\"</p> <p>Shah Qureshi, a partner at the law firm Bindmans, said that those that complained were victimised with the threat of disciplinary action.</p> <p>\"This type of scenario is akin to the 'master and servant' relationship of Victorian Britain and should have no place in the 21st Century,\" he said.</p> <p>Most of the workers were recruited in Britain to work for Carillion as porters, cleaners, and members of the housekeeping staff in Swindon's biggest hospital.</p> <p>Supervisors maintained a system whereby they expected gifts in return for favours but their demands were only made of non-white employees, according to the writ.</p> <p>Paulo Fernandes, a union rep, claimed that when he applied for a porter's job, he was asked by a female manager \"What will you give me?\" before being asked for a gold chain of a certain length, saying it had to be visible and not too long or too short.</p> <p>Fernandes, accompanied by a friend, handed over a chain belonging to his wife at the manager's house, it is claimed.</p> <p>He began work as a porter, but after four weeks was told that he was not doing his job properly and would have to return to a housekeeping job, it is also claimed. \"The claimant started to cry and was in complete shock,\" the papers noted.</p> <p>Another claimant, Irene de Souza, wanted to travel to Goa for 10 days in January 2011.</p> <p>She claimed a manager asked her for a gift, and she felt compelled to hand over perfume and a watch worth \u00a325. This was particularly distressing, she claimed, because it was a gift from her children.</p> <p>The gift-giving system carried on for years before the claimants joined the GMB union and issued a collective grievance procedure in December 2011, court papers said.</p> <p>The company carried out an investigation, the papers said, and the claimant cleaners were interviewed and told that their evidence was confidential.</p> <p>However, in June, the company told the workers that they were going to be subject to a disciplinary hearing because they had given gifts in return for benefits, the papers alleged.</p> <p>Staff say that one of the managers involved in obtaining gifts has left the company.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Carillion said they have investigated the allegations and concluded that gifts have been given in exchange for favours from managers.</p> <p>So far, 58 members of staff have filed claims with the tribunal since February, she said, and these will be \"vigorously\" defended by the company.</p> <p>\"In the circumstances it was appropriate that Carillion carried out disciplinary processes with employees who admitted giving or facilitating gifts for advantage. This is an ongoing process but outcomes so far have included training to those who gave gifts for advantage \u2013 not sanction.</p> <p>\"To be clear: Carillion will not tolerate racism or racist remarks from any of our employees, and racism goes completely against all our values as an organisation, as well as our policies.</p> <p>\"Claims are presently being subjected to a formal case management process by the tribunal. It is only once this process is completed at the end of this year that we will have a clear understanding of which cases the tribunal will expect Carillion to defend \u2013 and which claims the tribunal will not allow to proceed,\" she said.</p>"
